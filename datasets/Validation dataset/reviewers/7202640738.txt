16644378552	Measurement of suction and saturation of natural expansive soil slope	In order to study the variation of suction and saturation in natural slopes of unsaturated expansive soil and the rules of rainfall influencing suction and saturation, matrix suction and saturation in situ near a highway at Xiangfan in Hubei province were measured with thermal conductivity sensors and moisture probes for two months. Soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) is obtained from the data measured in situ, from which we can acquire air entry value (AEV) and residual saturation (RS). Permeability coefficient is derived from SWCC. At the same time, reasons and rules of suction variation with depth are explained.

27744439126	Digital image analysis of dynamic compaction effects on clay fills	This paper presents the findings of a digital image analysis based study of clay fills, compacted with dynamic compaction for a building foundation in northeast Beijing, People's Republic of China. Three levels of compaction energy were used at three compaction pits, respectively. Ground settlements and soil density increased with the number of dynamic impact blows. Microstructures of dry clay fill samples from the pits were examined with a scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Their microstructural parameters were further measured and analyzed quantitatively using digital image analysis. The clay SEM images are automatically converted into ternary images representing particles, pores, and contact zones for effective and efficient calculation of the clay microstructural parameters. The effect of dynamic compaction on the clay microstructural properties at different blow numbers and compaction energy levels is examined. Analysis revealed that the changes of the soil microstructural properties have a good correlation with the observed ground settlements at the three pits. The ground settlements are due to the size and shape changes and reorientation of the grain particles and pores of the clay fills. Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering © ASCE.

29244465544	Discussion on geomechanical patterns for right bank of Longpan slope deformation of Tiger Leaping Gorge hydropower station	Tiger Leaping Gorge hydropower station is a large project to be build on Jinsha River in southwest China. Longpan is one of the comparative dam addresses, but large-scale deviant rock mass was discovered on the right bank slope, where an old landslide once happened, so that Longpan dam was given up. In the latest studies, based on systematic field survey, especially through CSAMT exploration and comprehensive analyses of deformation characters of the rocks, it was proven not to be an old landslide but a deforming slope. The geologic structure of Longpan slope is very specific, and the dip direction of the stratums is opposite to slope. The sandstone stratums and slate stratums intercross alternately, and deep-seated stratums are dominate sandstone rock which are thick and hard, with large inclination angle. But the top of the slope stratums are with thin and small inclination, and the hard and soft rock-formations intercross mutually. Lake sediments at the foot of the slope account for the particular geologic structures. The results show the geomechanical deformation patterns are as follows: (1) the activities of the fractures induce deeply fragmentized phenomenon; (2) lithosphere raising, valley cutting downwards and transforming of the regional tectonic stress-field cause unloading rebound and cracking of lower rock mass; and (3) the main deformation pattern of top stratum was bend-creeping. By reason of the compressibility and plastic flowing of lake sediment and superficial stratum at the foot of the slope, rock mass is adjusting to the structure by the way of stagger-sliding and lateral expanding locally, but there is no weak zone of penetrating the slope. The mode can be named Longpan-pattern, which is universal in Tiger Leaping Gorge Reach in Jinsha River, and it is significant to choose the dam address and analyze the stability of reservoir banks.

3042785721	Five test methods for porosity of completely decomposed granite in Hong Kong	This paper presents the results of a laboratory examination of the porosity values of Hong Kong completely decomposed granites. Five methods are used to measure the porosity values. They are the conventional physical test, helium instrument, mercury injection, thin section measurement and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The porosity from the physical test is an absolute porosity with the largest values (average = 44.88%). The porosity from the thin section represents voids or cracks between mineral grains on a plane section and has the smallest values (average = 7.7%). The porosity from the helium instrument is an opening porosity. The porosity from the SEM also represents the voids on a SEM image. The porosity from mercury injection is an effective porosity. The porosity values from the SEM are closely between the opening and effective porosity values. They have the average values between 30% and 35%. In other words, the SEM method can be used to effectively estimate the opening or effective porosity in meso and/or micro scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

33745665085	Study on SWCC of unsaturated expansive soil	It has great important application value to study the relations between suction and moisture of unsaturated soil for its deformation and intensity. With the unsaturated triaxial equipment for expansive soil test, we analyze systematically the multi-factors such as the components of mineral, the structure of hole, the stress state of soil and the stress history etc., which affect soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). Especially the components of mineral and the structure of hole are primary influential factors. Based on the measurement of matric suction indoor and outdoor, we think over synthetically the effect of multi-factors to fit and compare SWCC, also we build the model of power function. And according to SWCC, the otherness is obvious in the curve of dry-damp circulation indoor and not obvious in the curve outdoor, which is similar to the welter curve indoor. The permeability and shear strength etc. of unsaturated expansive soil can be calculated by combining the curve outdoor with welter curve, which has great superiority in solving problems of geotechnical mechanics.

33746813159	Study on field test of rock-soil aggregate on right bank of Longpan in Tiger-Leaping Gorge area	Rock-soil aggregate is a special kind of engineering geological body, its mechanical characters are very complicated. It has huge influence on engineering projects. For it has very complicated physico-mechanical properties and the collection of its samples is very difficult, the study has not been sufficient so far. In order to make more study on the distortion and destruction characters of the rock-soil aggregate, six test sites on the right bank of Longpan in Tiger-leaping Gorge reservoir area are selected. In these six test sites, six horizontal push-shear in-situ tests were done, which include three non-water immersion tests and three water immersion tests, and some significant results were obtained. Through these in-situ tests, the strength characteristics and the complete stress-strain curves under various states were obtained. At the same time, by analyzing the group of block size and the three-dimensional sliding face, the mechanism of distortion and destruction of rock-soil is discussed to explain why the friction angle is on the high side in such kind of special geological body, and the conception of the average sliding surface which is used in calculating the strength parameters and the conception of the key diameter which is very important in determining the value of the cohesion are put forward. At the end, a reasonable reference value on the strength parameters of rock-soil aggregate in the study area is proposed to establish the foundation of the 3D slope stability analysis.

33845523570	Fractal study on the microstructure variation of soft soils in consolidation process	The characteristics and distribution of pores in soil are the internal cause of microstructure variation, and thus they are also the key factors in the determination of the physical and mechanical characteristics of the soft soil. To describe the micro-structure of the soil, the pore variation should be emphatically studied. Because of the complexity and uncertainty of pore behavior, it is difficult to describe the pore behavior with the traditional geometric methods. Taking the subgrade soft soil from the Zhujiang River Delta treated with Dynamic Drainage Consolidation as examples, the microstructures of un-consolidated and consolidated soft soils are studied by means of the mercury intrusion method. The fractal characteristics of pore distribution are studied through the data analysis by means of the fractal theory. The method of pore classification is proposed, and the relationship between porosity fractal dimension and consolidation degree formulated. The results indicate that the fractal characteristics of pore distribution are significant, and porosity fractal dimension can be employed for predicting the degree of consolidation of the soft soil.

33846474323	FCJ-GIS geodynamic zonation model and its application to risk evaluation of slope hazards	It is a rather well-known fact that slope hazards are resulted from the coupling of the Earth's endogenic and exogenic geodynamic action processes. The endogenic and exogenic geodynamic forces which are relative to slope evolution can be called geodynamic factors. In order to describe the influence of each geodynamic factor contributing to slope hazards in the coupling system, fuzzy comprehensive judgment (FCJ) method is applied; and a geodynamic zonation model based on FCJ-GIS theory is built up to show coupling intensity of geodynamic factors. The zonation model combined with the static environmental elements of the slope can be used to evaluate the slope hazards risk or to forecast the degree of geological hazard occurrence. Through the case study of slope hazards in Tiger-leaping Gorge, the results indicate that there are 88% hazards lying in high geodynamic intensity zonation regions, and then the static environment conditions to risk zonation analysis are unified, nearly 95% hazards in high risk zone. The data prove that the method of slope hazards risk evaluation based on FCJ-GIS geodynamic zonation model is feasible and correct; and the model can provide a new way for slope hazards risk evaluation or forecast.

33846175695	Numerical simulation on stability of right bank slope of Longpan in Tiger-Leaping Gorge area	The stability of the right bank slope of Longpan in Tiger-Leaping Gorge area is important to the building of the Tiger-Leaping Gorge reservoir. So it is important to select a proper method to obtain correct results. With the development of the calculations techniques, especially with the development of nonlinear mechanics of the rock and soil materials, the strength reduction FEM emerged as required. In the strength reduction FEM, it was not necessary to know where the slip surface was, and the initial geostatic stress could be included in the analysis which was more advantageous than the limited equilibrium method. The strength reduction FEM was used to study the stability of the right bank slope of Longpan in Tiger-Leaping Gorge area, and the stability coefficient of the slope under current stress state, the potential failure surface and its failure model. As a comparison, DEM analysis of the slope was executed. It was indicated that there was basic consistency between the results of the strength reduction FEM and DEM, which ensured the reliability of the result.

34147136533	Some geomechanical properties of soil-rock mixtures in the Hutiao Gorge area, China	Soil-rock mixtures, which are very complicated inhomogeneous materials, are widely encountered in geotechnical engineering projects. In this paper, in situ tests were performed on six samples of soil-rock mixtures in the Hutiao Gorge reservoir area to examine their mechanical characteristics. The deformation of the mixtures is closely related to the weight proportion of rock fragments and their size distribution, indicating that there may be critical fragment sizes that influence their mechanical properties, particularly cohesion. The soil-rock mixtures are sensitive to water. The results of the comparison between the tests of natural soil-rock mixtures and simulated-rain soil-rock mixtures give useful measured data for engineering evaluation and design. For natural soil-rock mixtures the cohesion c was 1-53 kPa and the internal friction angle φ was 46·0°; for saturated soil-rock mixtures c was 0-30 kPa and φ was 59·2°.

34047246023	Mesostructural character and numerical simulation of mechanical properties of soil-rock mixtures	Soil-rock mixture is a kind of inhomogeneous material; for the difficulty of in-situ sampling and the underdevelopment of large-scale laboratory soil test, at present the study of the soil-rock mixture's mechanical properties is still at initial stage. With the quick development of digital image processing method, digital image processing has been successfully used in many kinds of fields. Based on the digital image processing, the microstructural model of soil-rock mixture by taking into account the actual material inhomogeneity is constructed. The structural character of the distribution of blocks is studied statistically; and it is shown that the confusion is only the external performance of the soil-rock mixtures. In fact, soil-rock mixtures have a good character of self-comparability in statistics. Using geometry transformation, the model of soil-rock mixtures under dual digital image has been translated into a document format which can be received by finite element software. By this step, the numerical simulation of actual microstructures of soil-rock mixture is carried out. The numerical simulation of the large-scale direct shear test indicates that the blocks obviously influence the stress field of soil-rock mixtures, and then influence the deformation and fracture type. Three kinds of possible failure propagation routes in soil-rock mixtures are put forward.

34347225159	Property of soil-water characteristic curve for unsaturated soil	In order to describe the relationship between matrix suction and water content, soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) tests in lab and field were carried on. The effects of factors, such as substance constitution, plastic index, pore structure, stress history on SWCC were analyzed. The differences of matrix suction variety rules at different stresses and fillings were compared by testing matrix suction at nature slope, excavated slope and filling slope. The study results show that SWCC is not sole in same type soil. Relation between field matrix suction and water conternt was simulated by absorption curves in the lab at the same condition. When the matrix suction is between 100-1000 kPa, SWCC is linear relation so that feasibility of matrix suction monitoring has much promotion.

38849209067	Mechanical analysis of cut slope failures in expansive soil areas	As a special type of soil, expansive soil can be found in almost all countries. It is very easy to induce slips in superficial layers if the cut slopes have not been supported in time. The backscarp of the landslides, the scale of which is small, usually occurs in the middle of the slopes, and seldom happens at the top of the slopes. The toe is usually arcuate in shape. In order to research the forming mechanisms of superficial slides in expansive soil regions, FLAC<sup>3D</sup> software is used to simulate the effects of cracks and fissures in superficial layers on the deformation of the slope. Meanwhile, a creep model of expansive soil slopes is analyzed. A case study and monitoring results indicate that anchor frame beams can restrain expanding of cracks and fissures, and effectively strengthen the cutting slopes in expansive soil.

34247604674	Huashiban loose deposit landslide, Tiger-Leaping-Gorge, China: Analysis and prediction	The Huashiban landslide occurred in the Tiger-Leaping-Gorge, some 18 km upstream of the proposed Upper-Tiger-Leaping-Gorge dam across the Jinsha River. The main bedrock exposed in the high, cliff-like faces of the gorge is Permian marble, with three distinct joint sets which tend to form joint-bounded blocks. During normal conditions, some blocks fall to form a scree deposit in the lower valley, while following such events as the Lijiang earthquake (Ms 7) which occurred on 3 February 1996, there was a fast accumulation of loose material above the Carboniferous chlorite schists. Such geological conditions are prone to instability, particularly when the schists are softened by heavy rainfall such as occurred in September and October 1996; 60 mm being recorded on 4th October. The study has indicated that sufficient material to cause a self-weight landslide is likely to accumulate again within a period of some 35 years, although a failure could occur sooner in the event of an earthquake and/or exceptional rain. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

41549149647	Study on the mesostructure and mesomechanical characteristics of the soil-rock mixture using digital image processing based finite element method	The soil-rock mixture (SRM) is a kind of inhomogeneous geomaterial, which poses difficulties of in situ sample acquisition and in laboratory geomaterial tests; hence, the study of the SRM's mechanical properties is still at an early stage. In this paper, the technique of digital image processing based on the finite element method (DIP-FEM) is introduced to study SRMs in the Leaping Tiger Gorge Reservoir Area, China. Based on the DIP, the mesostructural characteristics of the SRM are analyzed statistically. The mesostructural concept model of SRM that can actually represent the inhomogeneity of SRM is built. By using geometry vectorizaiton transformation, the mesostructural model of SRM in the binary image format has been translated into a vector format (such as DWG or DXF format) which can be imported into the finite element software. By using the finite element method, two large-scale direct shear tests of inhomogeneous SRM and homogeneous soil are simulated. The numerical results indicate that the existence of "rock" blocks in SRM will greatly influence the distribution and the failure models of the internal stress field. As a result, three kinds of failure models of the SRM are put forward. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79952244117	Ring shear test for transform mechanism of slide-debris flow	The paper investigates the transform mechanism of slide-debris flow. The investigation is based on a case study of an actual transformation from landslide to debris flow event. The event occurred on July 7, 2007 in Da County, Sichuan Province, China. The landslide was induced by continuous rainfall from June 16 to July 7, 2007. The total rainfall was 521.6. mm. A part of the landslide debris transformed into debris flow which destroyed houses for about 200 people. The field investigation showed that the ground surface below and in front of the slickensided slip bed was obviously delaminated. A layer of silt about 20. cm was found on the surface and grains under the silt layer became coarser and coarser as the depth increased. Samples from the slidebody near the slip surface were collected and used in the ring shear test with in-situ stress level. The test was to simulate the long sliding and shearing course of the slidebody on the slip bed and the ground after its failure and to analyze what happened to the slidebody. The test results showed that in addition to the excessive pore water pressure due to shearing shrinkage, there was another mechanism facilitating the mobilization from landslide debris into debris flow. A thick liquefied layer of silt forms at the bottom of the slidebody, which could be due to grains crushing and delamination. The thickness of the silt layer increases as the shear displacement increases. The liquefied layer carries landslide debris moving fast and reduces its whole integrity greatly, making landslide debris easily break down into debris flow. This mechanism is called the soft base effect in this paper. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84861812898	The seepage risk analysis of surface runoff caused by the shallow thick coal seam mining	As for shallow thick coal seam, the overlying strata can not form steady structure and will break down until reach the surface ground, which will induced large ground deformation and fractures in the overlying strata during the mining. Under the condition of strong rainfall, surface runoff will influx to the collapse pit or supply to other aquifers, and inrush into the roadway through water flowing fractured zone. This paper takes the 4201, 4301, 4302, 4303 and 4401 coal faces of JingDong mine area in PingShuo for example, predicts the range of ground subsidence, settlement and the height of water flowing fractured zone dynamically after coal face mining, with the Flac3D numerical modeling software. On the base of result above and combined with geomorphic characteristics and hydrologic geology of the mine area, the author analyses risk of surface runoff seepage and put forward a dynamic water drainage design to prevent mine water bursting, which offers scientific foundation and data for safety production of the mine. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84926194079	Study of mechanism of landslide induced by rainfall in gently inclined red stratum in east Sichuan basin	Gently inclined red stratum widely distributes in East Sichuan Basin. Dip angle of this type of stratum is always between 3° and 10°, which is far less than the friction angle between bedding planes. In theory, the bedding landslide is unlikely to occur in red stratum. But in fact, rainfall induced landslide in gently inclined red stratum occurs frequently, which leads to a huge threat to the local people. Taking Qingning landslide in Da County, Sichuan province as an example, the geological model through field investigation and exploration is built;then analyzes the seepage field and static water pressure distribution before the landslide;a slope stability was analyzed based on the results of above seepage analysis. In order to obtain the characteristics of pore water pressure and shear resistance, the sliding zone soil is sampled to conduct ring shear test. The results indicate that landslide is due to coupled action of water pressure and shear resistance decreasing of sliding zone soil. The horizontal pushing force and vertical uplifting force due to rainfall infiltration initiated the landslide to deform and slid slowly, and then shear resistance decreasing of sliding zone soil led to the rapid sliding. Furthermore, a long rainfall and then a strong rainfall are deemed to be the necessary condition of landslide. Conclusions of this paper are the new findings in this field and can supply theoretical support for landslide forecasting and prevention in East Sichuan Basin.

Based on the information, the granularity characters, the fraction of the roughness of the rock blocks' surface, the directional dimension of rock blocks and the configuration characters were analyzed. The results indicate that confusion is only the external performance of the soil-rock mixtures. In fact, soil-rock mixtures have a good character of self-comparability in statistics.

Based on creep experiments for geogrids, it is shown that the bigger intensity geogrids have smaller strain under the same load action; and load and temperature have remarkable impact on the rheology of geogrids. Finite element method is effective to study the effect of geogrids on reinforcing soil; and the advantages and disadvantages of multifarious schemes can be compared conveniently. FEM (PLAXIS) is used to simulate the settlements under several different working states. The results indicate that the geogrids to control horizontal displacements is better than to control vertical displacement. The field load tests show that geogrids can boost bearing capacity of the road embankment severalfold, improve stress condition of soil, reduce differential settlements and total settlements effectively. Geogrids are good for reinforcing the road embankment observably and will be used in the practical engineering widely.

44849120946	Research on relationship between rock block proportion and shear strength of soil-rock mixtures based on digital image analysis and large direct shear test	With the development of geomechanics and the requirements of many large-scale engineering projects, soil-rock mixtures (SRM) have been regarded as a special type of soil and rock materials which are substantially different with the general soils and rocks in geotechnical engineering. In a large extent, the proportion and distribution of the rock block sizes control the physico-mechanical properties of SRM. Using digital image processing, rock block sizes in SRM samples are identified from the soil matrix. The proportion and distribution of the rock block sizes are then obtained quantitatively. Then the results are used for the sample preparation of the large scale direct shear tests, which cuts a new method for the test study of SRM. According to the results of the large scale direct shear tests, as a whole, the rock block size proportion controls the deformation and fracture mechanism of SRM. The shape of the shear stress versus the horizontal displacement curve and the vertical displacement versus the horizontal displacement curve of the remolded SRM samples are different from the general soils and rocks. With the increase of the rock block proportion, the shear band of SRM increased. When the rock block proportion lied in the range of 25% to 70%, the increment of the internal frication angle increased linearly with the increase of the rock block proportion. And the cohesion of the SRM decreased largely from the soil matrix. When the rock block proportion is large than 30%, however, there is only a little decrease in the cohesion with the increase of the rock block proportion.

Based on these parameters, numerical model to calculate the safety factor of reservoir accumulation slope is built. The results show that under two situations(with/without considering chemical and physical reactions between water and accumulation body), the changing trend of safety factor of slope is the same as the reservoir water level ascends, which decreases at first and then increases. However, compared with the former, the factor of safety under the latter situation decreases more, and decreasing ratio can reach 35.34% or more. Therefore, factor of safety calculated only considering the water-rock mechanical reaction is not reliable in practical engineering design.

Swelling characteristics of the expansive soil under different initial conditions were studied. The Dose Response model was used to fit the rules of swelling time interval for expansive soil immersed with water. The quantitative relationship among the swelling and over burden pressure, initial water content and initial dry density was attained by use of the ternary regression analysis. The rules of swelling for samples immersed with salt or acid water were similar to those of samples immersed with water. The swelling ratio of samples immersed with salt water was lower because of the seepage water pressure of salt water. The higher the concentration of the acid water, the higher the swelling ratio of samples and the longer the stabilization time. The important index obtained could be provided to the engineering design, construction and stability evaluation of expansive soil slopes.

The results indicate that during the initial impoundment period, the deformation of the ground surface is very slow, while the reservoir water level reaches certain elevation it exhibits a trend of sharp rise; the safety factor of the slope stability will decrease; and when the water level reaches a critical one it has the minimum value; hereafter it will rise with the water level rising; the sudden drawdown of the reservoir water level does affect the stability of the slope greatly; and the decreasing value of the safety factor will increase with the amplitude of the drawdown of the water level. All these results will be very useful not only for the practical engineering but also for the theoretical study of the soil-rock mixture slopes in reservoir area.

For the embankment engineering on an express highway in Yunnan Province, the expansive soil is improved with the cation modifier. The mechanism and the effectiveness of the improved expansive soil are discussed. It is discovered that hydrophilic nature and swelling-shrinkage property are changed drastically, that the free swelling ratio can be reduced, and that the particle size gradation, strength characteristics and hydrated properties of the treated expansive soil are improved by a wide range. Clay content decreases, but silt content increases. Pore decreases sharply, but the fabric is compact. The effectiveness of improving medicine reunited and cemented is obviously. The change of dry density with water content decreases and the hydrated property of modified soil is enhanced. The indexes are satisfied to the project and the cost is reduced. So the engineering properties of the treated expansive soil are improved to a considerable extent.

The method has applied various synthetically empirical formulas, numerical simulation and field exploration. In this way, a smaller safe width of waterproof coal (rock) pillar around fault is obtained comparing to previous safe width. Therefore, it results in an increase of recoverable reserves and mine life in Jinggezhuang Coal Mine. In particular, the method can be applied in other mines with similar geological conditions.

71049192225	Numerical simulation of dynamic stability of slope rock mass under seismic loading	Taking the deformed rock mass of Longpan slope along Jinsha River for example, the dynamic response and failure mechanism of slope rock mass under seismic loading are simulated by distinct element method. The time-history curve of artificially synthetic acceleration is used, and the effect of excess static pore water pressure is taken into account. The following results are obtained. The seismic inertia force results in accumulation of shear stress. The discontinuous structures are crucial to wave transmission. The ultimate dynamic response of slope system takes place at the initial period of seismic loading. Essentially the main mechanism of deformation and failure of rock mass induced by earthquake is the coupling effect of shear stress and excess static pore water pressure accumulation. At the same time, the results show that the deformed rock mass of Longpan slope is unlikely to form a long-distance landslide. This conclusion has important application value for the choice of dale dam site along Jinsha River.

0035306627	Mechanical behavior and microstructural variation of loess under dynamic compaction	The laboratory dynamic compaction test was used to study the effects of dynamic impact loads on the shear strength characteristics of loess. Loess specimens were compacted by different numbers of blows and their shear strengths measured. The experimental results revealed that the shear strength varies in stages with the number of blows. During the initial stage, the shear strength increases with the number of blows. It reaches a peak value and then decreases with the number of blows. To reveal the relationship between this alternation in shear strength and microstructural variation, quantitative microstructural analyses were performed on some tested specimens at different stages of strength evolution. This microstructural study demonstrated that the variation of shear strength is directly related to the alteration of microstructure. It is concluded that the shear strength of loess is basically controlled by its microstructural state. Growing particle size heterogeneity, varying particle orientations and increasing microstructural damage are the main causes of the alternation of shear strength. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

77949896311	Discrete element analysis of collapsing and sliding response of slope triggered by time difference coupling effects of P and S seismic waves - Taking Tangjiashan landslide in beichuan county for example	Collapsing and sliding responses of Tangjiashan landslide near Beichuan county and its running out process triggered by time difference coupling effects(considering horizontal and vertical seismic force effects all together), the regionality and spatial heterogeneity of P and S seismic waves generating horizontal and vertical seismic loads are elaborated; and formation mechanism and key controlling factors of collapsing and sliding of the slope are confirmed by applying DEM numerical simulation. The result shows that initial collapsing and sliding of the slope are triggered by combined action of horizontal and vertical tension caused by P seismic wave, and the vertical tension plays a superiority role. Ejecting and flowing of the broken slope mass are triggered by combined action of P and S seismic waves. Secondly, combined action between horizontal and vertical tension of P wave is the key controlling factor inducing the slope collapsing and sliding. At the same time, slope topography is the key controlling factor leading to collision and debris flow of the slope mass fractured in latter process. Finally, amplification effect of parameters in slope dynamic response shows that the amplification coefficient of vertical acceleration is larger than that of horizontal acceleration, and the vertical velocity and horizontal velocity decreasing one by one, and this trend is consistent with key controlling factor inducing slope fracturing, i.e. vertical seismic loads playing a superiority role. It is of great theoretical and practical value for studying collapsing and sliding of slopes triggered by seismic loads.

77952349253	Study of transform mechanism of landslide-debris flow with ring shear test	Taking the Qingning landslide in Sichuan Province for an example, its transform mechanism of landslide-debris flow has been studied. After mastering its transform course, longly sliding and shearing course of slide body after its instability are simulated with ring shear test; the physico-mechanical characters during shearing course are monitored. The result shows that the soft base effect is an important factor for transform of landslide-debris flow besides excess pore water pressure, which is the focus of research at present. Because of shearing shrinkage, grain crushing and layering, the sliding body volume of soil reduces in the course of shearing, which makes excess pore water pressure increase, and thus its shear strength decreases. Simultaneously, a thick liquefied layer has been formed at the bottom of sliding body, of which thickness increases with shearing displacement increasing. The liquefied layer carries sliding body moving fast and reduces its stability greatly, which is called ″soft base″ effect in this paper.

77955016133	Calculation study of Rankine earth pressure based on unified strength theory	The issue of wall earth pressure will be regarded as problem of plane strain, so intermediate principal stress is calculated by generalized Hook's law in plane strain assumption. The principal stress in accordance with the principle of Rankine earth pressure is determined. On this basis, the formula of Rankine earth pressure is derived when the expression of principal stress in double-shear unified strength theory is used. The weighted coefficient b considering effects of intermediate principal stress and the Poisson's ratio is introduced to the formula. The solution based on classical Rankine active earth pressure theory is a special case of the unified solution. The unified solution can be flexibly used to calculate earth pressure of various filled materials. Finally, an example is given to show the impact of their results in different weighted coefficients b. The analytical shows that the result of classical Rankine passive earth pressure theory is smaller, so it often causes the potential danger. However, the result of classical Rankine active earth pressure theory is larger and has enough safety storage. The potential strength of filling materials is sufficiently developed under the guidance of the double-shear unified strength theory, so some economic benefits can be obtained.

Just as its name implies, GA-Sarma algorithm is implemented based on Genetic algorithm and Sarma method. GA-Sarma algorithm assumes the morphology of slip surface to be a broken line with traceability to extend along the discontinuous surface structures, and the slice boundaries are consistent with rock mass discontinuities such as rock layers, faults, cracks, and so on. GA-Sarma algorithm is a revolutionary method that is suitable for global optimization of the critical slip surface for rock slopes.

77956859463	Collapsing and sliding response of slopes triggered by single and combined action with time difference of P and S seismic waves	The collapsing and sliding response of Xinzhong slope in Beichuan County and its collapsing process triggered by the single and combined action with time difference and the regionality and spatial heterogeneity of P and S seismic waves are studied. The formation mechanism and key factors are determined by applying DEM numerical simulation. The results show that the initial collapsing and sliding of the slope in running time, i.e. 8 seconds of numerical model, is triggered by the combined action of horizontal and vertical tensions caused by P seismic waves because of their relatively long distance from the initial epicenter inducing larger difference, i.e. 15.21 seconds in time, which P and S seismic waves consume from the hypocenter to the slope. What's more, the horizontal tension plays a superior role. Ejecting and flowing of the broken slope mass is triggered by the combined action of P and S seismic waves. Secondly, the combined action between horizontal and vertical tensions of P waves is the key factor inducing the collapsing and sliding of the slope under the known seismic tectonics, structure and tectonics of slope mass, weathering degree of rock mass as well as the physical and mechanical parameters of slope body. At the same time, the slope topography is the key factor leading to collision and debris flow of the slope mass fractured in latter process. Finally, the amplification effect of parameters in dynamic response of the slope shows that the amplification coefficient of horizontal acceleration is larger than that of vertical acceleration. The horizontal velocity and the vertical velocity decrease one by one, and this trend is consistent with the key factor inducing slope fracturing, i.e. horizontal seismic loads play a superior role. It provides a new method for studies on the initial collapsing and sliding of slopes triggered by seismic loads.

78649269991	Sensitivity analysis of parameters of Rankine's earth pressure with inclined surface considering intermediate principal stress	Up to now the Rankine's earth pressure theory has not been widely used under the condition of inclined surface. Generally, the classical earth pressure theories are based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion and the intermediate principal stress is not taken into account. First, a formula for Rankine's active and passive earth pressures with inclined surface as well as that for the intermediate principal stress in the plane strain assumption is derived. Then, the formula for shear strength parameters in the unified strength theory is derived based on the formula for the intermediate principal stress, so the shear strength parameters under the Mohr-Coulomb criterion can be transformed into the shear strength parameters under the unified strength theory. Finally, an example is given to carry out sensitivity analysis of six factors in terms of the design theory of orthogonal tests. The six influential factors are considered including the cohesion, internal friction angle, intermediate principal shear stress parameter, Poisson's ratio, angle of inclined surface and unit weight. It is shown that among the influential factors of Rankine's active earth pressure, the unit weight is the most important one, followed by the intermediate principal shear stress parameter, the cohesion, the internal friction angle, the angle of inclined surface and the Poisson's ratio; among those of Rankine's passive earth pressure, the internal friction angle is the most important one, followed by the intermediate principal shear stress parameter, the Poisson's ratio, the cohesion, the angle of inclined surface and the unit weight. So the effect of the intermediate principal stress on the calculated results of the Rankine's earth pressure is a critical factor.

The characteristics of expansion and contraction and break-down mechanism for expansive soil under different initial conditions are studied systematically. Does Response model is used to fit quantitatively the rules of swelling and shrinkage time interval for expansive soil. The results show that the difference between swelling and shrinkage for expansive soil is remarkable. Generally speaking, swelling ratio of samples immersed with water is larger than shrinkage ratio. The larger the expansion coefficients of samples under the same conditions are, the larger the contraction coefficients are. The anisotropy of samples is stronger. The internal and essence of shrinkage deformation disaster of expansive soil is that there are a lot of small clay particles, montmorillonite mineral crystal and significant microstructural characteristics. And the external cause is the development of micropore, fracture structure and the initial state.

0036704871	Characteristics and trends of land subsidence in Tanggu, Tianjin, China	Land subsidence in the Tanggu area is directly related to withdrawal of shallow ground-water within a depth of 300 m. The main strata responsible for the subsidence are at a depth of between 136 and 300 m. The contribution to subsidence made by the clayey soils is dierent from that of the sandy soils, as the former is related to the seasonal dropping of the water table while the latter is associated with annual changes. In addition, while there is a clear correlation between the accumulative groundwater extraction and the accumulative subsidence, this linear relationship is not obvious between annual extraction and annual subsidence. A case study in Tanggu, Tianjin, is presented in order to demonstrate a proposed computational model to predict land subsidence - the Optimization Model for Land Subsidence (OMLS).

79957634743	Study of rules of stress waves propagation under various attitudes of large-scale fractures	First of all, the feasibility of using a universal distinct element code (UDEC) to simulate stress waves propagation in rockmass has been validated. Then, the study about the rules of stress waves crossing fractures which have various attitudes has been conducted. The three main fractures in Longmenshan region affecting the stress waves propagation are used as an example to validate the rules of stress waves crossing fractures and illustrate the shock isolation effects and the hanging wall effects of the large-scale fracture. The main research results can be summarized as follows: (1) The dynamic responses of the earth's surface beside the fractures are anomalous compared with that on the fractures; and the dynamic responses of the earth's surface on the side of hypocenter will be more seriously than that on the other side. (2) With the increasing of fractures attitudes from 0° to 90°, the shock isolation effects of fractures on stress waves firstly will increase and then will decrease; and the dynamic responses caused by transmitted waves will be weaker with the increasing of the amount of fractures. (3) Wenchuan-Maoxian fault and Guanxian-Anxian fault are not coseismic fault; so they have shown good shock isolation in the process of Wenchuan earthquake. Compared to the condition without faults, the vertical peak ground accelerations of hanging wall surface of Wenchuan-Maoxian fault and foot wall surface of Guanxian-Anxian fault decrease 38% and 47% respectively. (4) Because of the faults reflecting the earthquake waves, the dynamic responses of earth's surfaces of the hanging wall and footwall of Yingxiu-Beichuan fault are serious compared to the state without faults. The vertical peak ground accelerations of the hanging wall and footwall surface of Yingxiu-Beichuan fault increase 41% and 32% respectively. The above research results reflect the shock isolation effect and hanging wall effect of fractures.

84871049473	Failure mechanisms of the landslides triggered by the 2008 wenchuan earthquake, china	Taking the landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake as examples, their dynamic responses with different epicenter distances due to single and combined action with regionality and spatial heterogeneity of the Primary and Secondary waves were simulated by applying the Universal Distinct Element Code software. The results shows that the slope suffered from the combined action between P and S waves appears instability prior to the slope under single action of P wave. With the epicenter distance increasing, the key controlling factor resulting in the slope failure varies from the combined seismic action between P and S waves to the single seismic action of the P wave. As for the formation mechanism of slope instability, coupled action between the vertical and horizontal seismic forces results in the slope dynamic failure with key action varying from the vertical to the horizontal one. Finally, the initial instability originates always at slope shoulder due to the peak ground acceleration amplification effect and the variation trend of the slope mechanical parameters on its fracturing of the seismic action. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

On the basis of straight shear tests on earth-rock aggregate and bedrock, the sliding surface of talus slide is a combination of two media: strain-hardening and strain-softening. A shear stress-strain constitutive model for the strain-softening medium is described by the Weibull's distribution law. A shear stress-strain constitutive model for the strain-hardening medium is described by the linear equation. Based on a simplified model for anti-sliding piles in talus slide, the formulas for calculating thrust on anti-sliding piles are derived by considering the above two shear stress-strain constitutive models. How the main parameters of the proposed formulas affect the distribution laws of talus slide thrust on anti-sliding pile is discussed. Finally, the rationality of the proposed formulas is demonstrated based on comparative analysis of the theoretical and the experimental results.

84899622692	"Plagioclase solution degree index": A new index to evaluate the weathering degree of granite	The weathering degree of rocks has an adverse influence on their strength and deformability characteristics, which in turn influences the industrial uses of rock. The need to develop a weathering index that reveals their mechanical and engineering geological behaviors is thus pertinent to enable the building of more accurate models for forecasting geological hazards. Granite weathering in the Ma On San, Shek Kip Mei and Kwun Tong areas of Hong Kong was studied using scan electron microscope (SEM) images to observe mineral shapes for detailed identification of the weathering degree of completely decomposed granite (CDG). Plagioclase images captured from the SEM were subsequently analyzed and processed with the use of a microstructural image processing system. The results of the analyses indicate that plagioclase, though sensitive to weathering, still remains in CDG and is preserved at different weathering degrees. Hence, it provides a possibility for evaluating the weathering degree more accurately. Thus, a new index referred to as the plagioclase solution degree index is proposed to evaluate the weathering degree of granite. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The slope shows evidences of instability phenomena characterized by shallow landslides and several extensive cracks along slide crown, which seriously affects the life of local residents. In order to characterize the mechanical behavior of the deposit with evaluation of the actual strength parameters and permeability while taking into account the influence of the block proportion, seven test points were established for in situ S-RM and constant-head injection tests on a large scale. The results indicated a larger internal friction angle and lower cohesion for S-RM from in situ tests compared to tests results obtained from laboratory testing. Moreover, it was noted that the strength parameters were correlated with the block proportion by weight (WBP) of S-RM, while both internal friction angle and cohesion were observed to be strongly affected by a critical WBP threshold (70 %), which is in agreement with the common S-RM mechanical behavior. Furthermore, permeability increases with WBP increase to more than 70 %, denoting a similar threshold to the findings observed in strength characteristics.

The finite element method of numerical simulation is applied (using linear elastic and hardening soil models) to simulate stability of the excavation slope and deformation with and without reinforcement, with a view to predict the deformation trend, design the reinforcement scheme, decrease the unrealistically large heave at the base of excavation and horizontal displacement of the excavation slope, and ensure the safety of the project. The simulation results show that the stress field redistributes after excavation and reinforcement, and the horizontal displacement of the slope is inhibited effectively, while the soil at the base of the bunker should be emphatically compacted and supported by piles. The field-measured data are in better agreement with the results calculated from the hardening-soil model and the combined support mode of anchor and soil nail. Thus, the results can be used to determine the key deformation range and reinforcing areas for engineering design.

In theoretical study and engineering practice the following parameters are used to describe the characteristics in the three aspects: large, middle and small, micro-pores, gravel, sand, silt and clay particles, three major mineral components (quartz, feldspar and clay minerals), etc. How large of the variation range of these indices in one certain size of trial pits and blocks? How about the correlation of the indices in the three parts? As factors of soil structure, how large of their weight ratios once the soil structure is to be under considerations? In this paper, a total of 51 nos. specimens from 18 nos. blocks from three trial pits of two slopes in Kowloon, Hong Kong, were taken as examples. The test is carried out by means of the mercury injection, particle size distribution and X-ray diffraction. After preliminary analysis, it is found that the CDG with coarse particle portions is very different from that with fine particle portions. The former belongs to gravel soil and sandy gravel soil, and some of it is gravel-bearing soil, with more big pores, more quartz and clay minerals. The latter belongs to gravel-bearing soil, some is fine sandy soil and sub-sandy soil, with more micropores, more feldspars. Variations of feldspar and clay mineral contents are inverse to each other. Furthermore, the interaction matrix is applied for analysis of the correlation of the 9 indices. As a result, it is found that the correlation coefficient varies to a great extent. According to the value of the correlation coefficient, those indices with larger ones are: gravel and sand particles (0.948), big pores and middle-small pores (0.846), quartz and feldspar (0.827), feldspar and clay minerals (0.747). If the soil structure factors are under considerations, the 9 indices are in sequence of weight ratio from large to small: micro-pores, feldspar, clay minerals, sandy particles, gravel, large pores, middle-small pores, silt and clay particles, quartz. These indices, quantified after their correlations and weight ratios, provide bases for the study of micro-features in detail and classifications of the CDG, and perhaps act as one of the basement for the constitution equations of microstructure mechanics of soils to be built.
