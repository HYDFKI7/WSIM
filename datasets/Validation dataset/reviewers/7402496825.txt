84927173105	K-ras mutational status in cytohistological tissue as a molecular marker for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background. More clinically meaningful diagnostic tests are needed in pancreatic cancer (PC). K-ras mutations are the most frequently acquired genetic alteration. Methods. Original research articles involving the diagnostic accuracy of K-ras mutation detection in PC were selected. Data were presented as forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis was used to summarize the overall test performance. Results. We assessed 19 studies from 16 published articles. The reports were divided into three groups according to the process used to obtain the test material. The summary estimates for detecting K-ras status using an invasive method (fine needle aspiration (FNA), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or surgery) were better than cytology: the pooled sensitivity was 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 74-80%) versus 54% (95% CI: 47-61%); specificity was 88% (95% CI: 85-91%) versus 91% (95% CI: 83-96%); and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 20.26 (11.40-36.03) versus 7.52 (95% CI: 2.80-20.18), respectively. When two procedures were combined, the diagnostic accuracy was markedly improved. Conclusions. The analysis of K-ras mutations in pancreatic tissue has a promising diagnostic significance in PC. Further valuable studies are needed.

84931038137	Diagnostic Performance of Des- γ -carboxy Prothrombin for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis	Background. There have been many reports on des-γ-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) as a promising serum marker in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the results are inconsistent and even conflicting. Methods. This meta-analysis was performed to investigate the performance of DCP in the diagnosis of HCC. Following a systematic review of relevant studies, Meta-DiSc 1.4 software was used to extract data and to calculate the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). Data are presented as forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) analysis was used to summarize the overall test performance. Results. Twelve studies were included in our meta-analysis. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PLR, and NLR of DCP for the detection of HCC in the studies included were 71% (95%CI: 68%-73%), 84% (95%CI: 83%-86%), 6.48 (95%CI: 4.22-9.93), and 0.33 (95%CI: 0.25-0.43), respectively. The area under the SROC curve was 0.8930 and the Q index was 0.8238. Significant heterogeneity was found. Conclusion. This meta-analysis indicated that DCP had moderate diagnostic accuracy in HCC. Further studies with rigorous design, large sample size, and mmultiregional cooperation are needed in the future.

80052689358	A meta-analysis of enteral nutrition and total parenteral nutrition in patients with acute pancreatitis	Objective. To analyze the effect of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and enteral nutrition (EN) in patients with acute pancreatitis. Methods. Randomized controlled trials of TPN and EN in patients with acute pancreatitis were searched in NCBI and CBM databases and The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Six studies were enrolled into the analysis, and the details about the trial designs, characters of the subjects, results of the studies were reviewed by two independent authors and analyzed by STATA 11.0 software. Results. Compared with TPN, EN was associated with a significantly lower incidence of pancreatic infection complications (RR=0.556, 95% CI 0.436∼0.709, P=.000), MOF (RR=0.395, 95% CI 0.272∼0.573, P=.003), surgical interventions (RR=0.556, 95% CI 0.436∼0.709, P=.000), and mortality (RR=0.426, 95% CI 0.238∼0.764, P=.167). There was no statistic significance in non-pancreatitis-related complications (RR=0.853, 95% CI 0.4901.483, P=.017). However, EN had a significantly higher incidence of non-infection-related complications (RR=2.697, 95% CI 1.947∼3.735, P=.994). Conclusion. EN could be the preferred nutrition feeding method in patients with acute pancreatitis. Copyright © 2011 Heming Quan et al.

84877123392	The miR-146a rs2910164 G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to digestive cancer in chinese	Background: Several studies have reported the role of the miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism as a susceptibility factor for several digestive cancers. However, the results have been controversial. Therefore, we conducted the present meta-analysis to obtain the most reliable estimate of the association. Methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled to assess the strength of the association between miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism and digestive cancer risk. A total of four eligible studies including 3,447 cases and 5,041 controls based on the search criteria were included. Results: We observed that miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism was not significantly correlated with digestive cancer risks when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis. While we found that miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was not associated with gastric cancer, it was significantly linked with hepatocellular cancer risk (the homozygote codominant model: OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.04-1.87). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Chinese population for the allele contrast model (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.12-1.38), for the homozygote codominant model (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.28-2.04), and for the recessive model (OR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.16-1.64). However, studies with Asian groups presented no significant association for all genetic models. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the miR-146a rs2910164 G > C polymorphism is a low-penetrant risk factor for digestive cancers in Chinese.

84877271846	Rifaximin versus nonabsorbable disaccharides for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy: A meta-analysis	Background. Many studies have found that the antibiotic rifaximin is effective for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. However, there is no uniform view on the efficacy and safety of rifaximin. Methods. We performed a meta-analysis through electronic searches to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rifaximin in comparison with nonabsorbable disaccharides. Results. A total of 8 randomized controlled trials including 407 patients were included. The efficacy of rifaximin was equivalent to nonabsorbable disaccharides according to the statistical data (risk ratio (RR): 1.06, 95% CI: 0.94-1.19; P = 0.34). Analysis showed that patients treated with rifaximin had better results in serum ammonia levels (weighted mean difference (WMD): -10.63, 95% CI: -30.63-9.38; P = 0.30), mental status (WMD: -0.32, 95% CI: -0.67-0.03; P = 0.07), asterixis (WMD: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.31-0.08; P = 0.23), electroencephalogram response (WMD: -0.21, 95% CI: -0.34 - 0.09; P = 0.0007), and grades of portosystemic encephalopathy (WMD: -2.30, 95% CI: -2.78 - 1.82; P < 0.00001), but only the last ones had statistical significance. The safety of rifaximin was better than nonabsorbable disaccharides (RR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10-0.34; P < 0.00001). Conclusion. Rifaximin is at least as effective as nonabsorbable disaccharides, maybe better for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. And the safety of rifaximin is better. © 2013 Dong Wu et al.

84898004623	Anti-miR-197 inhibits migration in HCC cells by targeting KAI 1/CD82	Aim To investigate the metastatic effects and mechanisms of miR-197 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods and results The levels of miR-197 increased in HCC cells and tissues compared with a normal hepatic cell line (LO2) and adjacent nontumorous liver tissues, respectively. miR-197 expression negatively correlated with CD82 mRNA expression in these cell lines and tissues. Dual luciferase reporter assay and Western blot confirmed a direct interaction between miR-197 and CD82 3′UTR sequences. After miR-197 was silenced in HCC cells, CD82 expression increased. In the presence of human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cells silenced for anti-miR-197 exhibited elongated cellular tails and diminished lamellipodia due to reductions in both ROCK activity and the levels of Rac 1 protein. Downregulation of miR-197 along with the upregulation of CD82 in HCC cells resulted in the inhibition of HCC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Taken together, these data suggest that anti-miR-197 suppresses HCC migration and invasion by targeting CD82. The regulation of the miR-197/CD82 axis could be a novel therapeutic target in future HCC effective therapy. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

48149084823	Selective inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 suppresses the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a prostaglandin synthetase, is involved in development of certain tumors. We therefore analyzed COX-2 expression in pancreatic cancer tissues (53 samples) and Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and western-blotting analyses. Also, immunohistochemistry of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was performed. We found expression of COX-2 was dramatically upregulated in 36 of 53 cases (67.9%) and the expression of COX-2 was associated with the diameter (> 3 cm) of the tumors (p < 0.05), but not with the age, gender, tumor location, differentiation, lymph-node metastases and TNM stage. The positivity rate of PCNA expression in the pancreatic cancer cells of the COX-2 positive group (32.88 ± 13.26%) was significantly higher than that in the COX-2 negative group (24.56 ± 11.51%) (p <0.05). Then we investigated the effect of selective inhibitors of COX-2 (NS398 and celecoxib) on proliferation of Panc-1 cells by 3-(4,5 dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2.5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Either NS398 or celecoxib suppressed proliferation of Panc-1 cells dose-dependently in vitro. Furthermore, Panc-1 cells were implanted into nude mice, and celecoxib was administrated orally with feed. The volume of the tumor xenografted into nude mice was decreased by 51.6% in the celecoxib group (p<0.01). In conclusion, the increased expression of COX-2 may be responsible for rapid proliferation of pancreatic cancer, and specific inhibition of COX-2 suppresses proliferation of Panc-1 cells in vitro and in nude mice, The selective inhibitor of COX-2 may be an effectual agent for pancreatic cancer chemoprevention. © 2008 Tohoku University Medical Press.

54349106979	PCR-SSCP-DNA sequencing method in detecting PTEN gene mutation and its significance in human gastric cancer	Aim: To discuss the possible effect of PTEN gene mutations on occurrence and development of gastric cancer. Methods: Fifty-three gastric cancer specimens were selected to probe PTEN gene mutations in genome of gastric cancer and paracancerous tissues using PCR-SSCP-DNA sequencing method based on microdissection and to observe the protein expression by immunohistochemistry technique. Results: PCR-SSCP-DNA sequencing indicated that 4 kinds of mutation sites were found in 5 of 53 gastric cancer specimens. One kind of mutation was found in exons. AA-TCC mutation was located at 40bp upstream of 3′ lateral exon 7 (115946 AA-TCC). Such mutations led to terminator formation in the 297th codon of the PTEN gene. The other 3 kinds of mutation were found in introns, including a G-C point mutation at 91 bp upstream of 5′ lateral exon 5(90896 G-C), a T-G point mutation at 24 bp upstream of 5′ lateral exon 5 (90963 T-G), and a single base A mutation at 7 bp upstream of 5′ lateral exon 5 (90980 A del). The PTEN protein expression in gastric cancer and paracancerous tissues detected using immunohistochemistry technique indicated that the total positive rate of PTEN protein expression was 66% in gastric cancer tissue, which was significantly lower than that (100%) in paracancerous tissues (P <0.005). Conclusion: PTEN gene mutation and expression may play an important role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer, © 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

63349112659	Expression of integrin in hepatic fibrosis and intervention of resveratrol	The aim of this study was to explore the expression of integrin-β1 in different stages of hepatic fibrosis and intervention of resveratrol as well as the way by which integrin-β1 promoted hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis models of male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were created and intragastric administration of resveratrol was given in low (40 mg/ kg), middle (120 mg/kg) and high (200 mg/kg) dose groups. The expression of integrin-β1, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in different stages of hepatic fibrosis was detected by using RT-PCR. The expression of hexadecenoic acid (HA) and precollagen III (pc III) was assayed by radioimmunoassay. The expression of integrin-β1, TGF-β and TIMP-1 was determined in each group. Liver function and pathological sections of each group in different stages of hepatic fibrosis was tested to judge the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol at different doses. The expression of integrin-β1 in normal control group was low and steady and was not increased with the development of hepatic fibrosis, but it was increased in other groups. The expression levels of integrin-β1 in the model control group (0.878 ± 0.03, P < 0.01) and low dose group (0.855 ± 0.04, P < 0.01) were higher than other groups, but there was no difference between model control group and low dose group (P > 0.05). The expression levels of integrin-β1 and TGF-β in middle dose group and high dose group were higher than other groups (P < 0.01). The expression levels of integrin-β1 and TGF-β in model control group and low dose group were lower than the normal control group (P < 0.01). The expression levels of TIMP-1 in the model control and low dose groups were higher than the other groups (P < 0.01). The expression levels of TIMP-1 in the middle dose group and the high dose group were lower than the normal control group (P < 0.01). The expression of integrin-β1 existed in all stages of hepatic fibrosis of SD rats, and it was increased with the development of hepatic fibrosis. The expression of TGF-β and TIMP-1 was consistent with that of integrin-β1 in different stages of hepatic fibrosis. Resveratrol could improve the degree of hepatic fibrosis of SD rats and decrease the expression of integrin-β1 markedly at a dose of 120 mg/kg. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

63049089134	Development and evaluation of the quality of life instrument in chronic liver disease patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy	Objectives: The objective was to develop a valid and reliable health-related quality of life (HRQOL) assessment tool to measure the functional and health status of patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy (mHE). Methods: Items potentially affecting the HRQOL of these patients were identified, based on the responses from 53 patients with minimal hepatic encephalopathy, from seven liver experts, four epidemiologists and from a PubMed search of the literature. Results were explored using factor analysis and redundant questions were eliminated. The final stated questionnaire was used in 178 patients with mHE to evaluate its reliability and validity. Results: Thirty-five items proved to be important for 32 respondents in the item reduction sample. The final instrument included five domains (30 items) which were shown as follows: physical functioning (8 items), psychological well-being (7 items), symptoms/side effects (7 items), social functioning (4 items) and general-health (4 items). An inter-item correlation for each of the five domains ranged from 0.220 to 0.776, with a mean of 0.280. Cronbach's alpha for above five domains was 0.8775, 0.8446, 0.8360, 0.7087 and 0.7016 respectively. The test-retest coefficients for the five domains were 0.94, 0.93, 0.96, 0.82 and 0.83 respectively. Factor analysis showed preservation of five components structure. Cumulative variance of principal components was 63.12%. Patients with more advanced disease seemed to have more impairment of their well-being, especially in the symptoms/side effects domain. Conclusions: The instrument is short, easy to administer and is of good validity and reliability in patients with mHE. © 2008 Journal of astroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

77953357984	Data mining of microarray for differentially expressed genes in liver metastasis from gastric cancer	Tumor metastasis is the leading cause of death for gastric cancer. Metastasis is the main reason for the failure of clinical treatment for gastric cancer. In order to find metastasis-related genes and abnormal signal transduction pathway of high-invasive gastric cancer, samples of gastric cancer with liver metastasis were collected for microarray detection; up-regulated or down-regulated genes in all three cases were simultaneously screened out. Subsequently, from the preliminary screened genes, molecular pathways possibly impacting liver metastasis from gastric cancer were investigated by the Gene Cluster with Literature Profiles (GenCLip) analysis software. Many biological effects including apoptosis have been validated. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that a variety of biological pathways, such as blood circulation and gas exchange, vasodilation and vasoconstriction regulation, and immune defense, could be significantly activated. Besides, gene sequences, specific keywords or gene regulatory networks were further searched by GenCLiP. We conclude that data mining allows to quickly identify a series of special signal transduction pathways involving abnormally expressed genes. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77953371637	Hedgehog signaling pathway regulates growth of human digestive tract tumor cells	Objective: To study the expression of Shh, patched (PTCH), smoothened (Smo) and Gli-1 genes, four components of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, in colonic cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer cell line and colonic adenoma tissues, and to discuss the influence of cyclopamine, a Smo receptor specific inhibitor, on the growth of these tumor cells. Methods: The expression of Shh, PTCH, Smo and Gli-1 were investigated using RT-PCR in 4 colonic cancer cell lines (LS174T, HCT116, SW116 and CT26), pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC3 and 2 colonic adenoma tissues. MTT method was used to study the inhibitory effect of cyclopamine on the growth of these cancer cell lines in vitro. Results: Shh, PTCH, Smo and Gli-1 genes were expressed in 2 of colonic adenoma tissues and SW116, CT26 and BxPC3 cells. The mRNA of Smo and PTCH genes were not found in LS174T and HCT116 cells; the expression of Shh and Gli-1 mRNA were significantly up-regulated. Cyclopamine inhibited the growth of SW116, CT-26 and BxPC3, expecially the positive cells of Smo gene. Conclusion: Shh, PTCH, Smo and Gli-1 genes are expressed in colonic cancer cell lines, pancreatic cancer cell line and colonic adenoma tissues, Cyclopamine has obvious inhibitory effect on cells with overexpression of Smo, which implies that Hedgehog signaling pathway might be activated in some tumor cells of digestive system.

77956608762	Gli1 maintains cell survival by up-regulating IGFBP6 and Bcl-2 through promoter regions in parallel manner in pancreatic cancer cells	Background: Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been reported to be related to malignant biological behavior of pancreatic cancer but its mechanism is unclear yet. Since IGF pathway and Bcl-2 family are involved in proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, we hypothesize that they are possibly associated with Hh pathway. Materials and Methods: We studied the relationship of Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway with proliferation and apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells and the regulation of transcription factor Gli1 to insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) and Bcl-2 genes at the level of transcription. Results: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smoothened (Smo), patched and Gli1 were expressed in pancreatic cancer cells. Cyclopamine inhibited cell proliferation at low concentration and induced apoptosis at high concentration. Effect of RNA interference (RNAi) for Gli1 to cell survival is mainly due to proliferation inhibition though involved in apoptosis. The transcription factor Gli1 bound to promoter regions of Bcl-2 and IGFBP6 genes and the levels of IGFBP6, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Bcl-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) were decreased as well as Gli1 mRNA significantly by cyclopamine or RNAi in cultured pancreatic cancer cells (p < 0.01). Finally PCNA, IGFBP6 and Bcl-2 mRNA were upregulated as well as Shh or Gli1 in pancreatic cancer tissues (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our study reveals that Gli1 maintained cell survival by binding the promoter regions and facilitating transcription of IGFBP6 and Bcl-2 genes in a parallel manner in pancreatic cancer cells and suggests it may be one of the mechanisms of Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. © 2009 Xuan.

Methods: HepG2 cells cultured in vitro were treated with 50, 100, 150 and 200 μmol/L Res for 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. CCK-8 assay was employed to examine the cell proliferation, and the expression of FAK mRNA and miR-151 was detected by Real-Time PCR. Transfection with miR-151 mimics was conducted, and HepG cells with miR-15 overexpression were obtained (miR-151 overexpression group). Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining were adopted to detect the effects of miR-15 overexpression on cell cycle and apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Cells transfected with mimics mutants and those without transfection were served as negative controls and blank controls, respectively. Results: Res significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and decrease the expression of FAK mRNA and miR-151 of HepG2 cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner to some degree. The expression of miR-151 of HepG2 cells in miR-151 overexpression group was significantly higher than that in negative control group and blank control group (P < 0. 001).

79954522869	Identification of RegIV as a novel GLI1 target gene in human pancreatic cancer	Background and Aims: GLI1 is the key transcriptional factor in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. RegIV is associated with regeneration, and cell growth, survival, adhesion and resistance to apoptosis. We aimed to study RegIV expression in pancreatic cancer and its relationship to GLI1. Methods: GLI1 and RegIV expression were evaluated in tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissues of pancreatic cancer patients and 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and the correlation between them. The GLI1-shRNA lentiviral vector was constructed and transfected into PANC-1, and lentiviral vector containing the GLI1 expression sequence was constructed and transfected into BxPC-3. GLI1 and RegIV expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Finally we demonstrated RegIV to be the target of GLI1 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Results: The results of IHC and qRT-PCR showed that RegIV and GLI1 expression was higher in pancreatic cancer tissues versus adjacent normal tissues (p<0.001). RegIV expression correlated with GLI1 expression in these tissues (R = 0.795, p<0.0001). These results were verified for protein (R = 0.939, p = 0.018) and mRNA expression (R = 0.959, p = 0.011) in 5 pancreatic cancer cell lines. RegIV mRNA and protein expression was decreased (94.7±0.3%, 84.1±0.5%; respectively) when GLI1 was knocked down (82.1±3.2%, 76.7±2.2%; respectively) by the RNAi technique. GLI1 overexpression in mRNA and protein level (924.5±5.3%, 362.1±3.5%; respectively) induced RegIV overexpression (729.1±4.3%, 339.0±3.7%; respectively). Moreover, CHIP and EMSA assays showed GLI1 protein bound to RegIV promotor regions (GATCATCCA) in pancreatic cancer cells. Conclusion: GLI1 promotes RegIV transcription by binding to the RegIV gene promoter in pancreatic cancer. © 2011 Wang et al.

79955837437	Reg4 protects against acinar cell necrosis in experimental pancreatitis	Background and aims: Reg4 is a recently discovered member of the regenerating gene family with distinctive expression profiles in primary cancers. To date, the physiological function of Reg4 is poorly understood. Previously, the authors found that Reg4 was markedly upregulated during acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Reg4 in experimental pancreatitis. Methods: AP was induced in C57BL/6 mice by administration of either L-arginine or caerulein, and Reg4 expression was assessed by immunofluorescence, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and western blot analyses. Recombinant human Reg4 protein (rReg4), heat-inactivated Reg4, neutralising antibody and vehicle were also administered to mice by subcutaneous injection. The severity of AP was determined by measuring amylase and lipase activities in the serum and histological grading. The effect of rReg4 on cell death was examined and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p-EGFR, Akt, p-Akt, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression were assessed by western blot analysis of isolated murine acinar cells treated with L-arginine. Results: Reg4 mRNA and protein were markedly upregulated during arginine-induced pancreatitis. Reg4 was widely expressed in residual acinar cells around the islets and regenerating metaplastic epithelium. rReg4 could protect against arginine-induced necrosis of acinar cells both in vivo and in vitro. This protective effect was also confirmed in the caerulein-induced murine model of AP. It was shown that arginine induced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, while rReg4 upregulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression by activating the EGFR/Akt pathway. The upregulation of Bcl-xL correlated inversely with cell necrosis in isolated pancreatic acinar cells.

79957518275	Effect of glioma-associated oncogene 1 on the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells	Objective: To investigate the effect of glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI 1) on the proliferation ability of human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. Methods: The recombinant lentiviral vector of RNA interference (RNAi)-targeting GLI 1 gene was constructed. The pLVTHM-GLI1-shRNA or pLVTHM-GFP lentivirus (as the control) was infected into PANC-1 cells. The expressions of GLI1, bcl-2, bcl-xl and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNAs and proteins were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, and the cell growth was measured by cell count kit-8 (CCK8) assay. Results: The GLI1-shRNA-PANC-1 cells with stable low-expression of GLI1 were successfully established. Compared with GFP-PANC-1 and PANC-1 cells, the expression levels of GLI1 mRNA and protein in GLI1-shRNA-PANC-1 cells were down-regulated by (82.1±3.2)% and (76.7± 2.2)%, respectively (P<0.01), and the expression levels of bcl-2 mRNA and protein were down-regulated (49.7±5.4)% and by (43.5±9.4)%, respectively (P<0.01). There were no obvious changes in expressions of bcl-xl or PCNA mRNA and protein among three groups. The proliferation inhibitory rate of GLI1-shRNA-PANC-1 cells was higher than those in GFP-PANC-1 and PANC-1 cells (P<0.05). Conclusion: GLI1 RNAi can inhibit the proliferation ability of pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells. This effect may be associated with the down-regulation of bcl-2 expression.

79959745854	Increased expression of cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated gene (CREG) in gastric cancer patients: A mechanism of proliferation and metastasis in cancer	Background: The cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG), a secreted glycoprotein, has been studied with human embryonic carcinoma cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. However, its relationship to tumor cell proliferation and metastasis has not been examined in human gastric cancers (GC) until now. Aim: To investigate the expression of CREG in GC and its association with GC cell proliferation and metastasis. Methods: Forty-two cases of GCs, matched normal gastric tissues, and the human gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, SGC-7901, MKN45, normal gastric mucosa cell line GES, and HUVEC cell line ECV304 were used to analyze CREG expression at the level of mRNA and protein. The expression of CREG was then further examined by immunohistochemistry in 42 GC tissues, and the correlation between the level of CREG and the pathological and clinical data was evaluated. Finally, we down-regulated the expression of CREG in GC cells with specific siRNA, and assessed the role of CREG in the proliferation and metastasis/invasion of the GC cell line. Results: The level of CREG was found to be higher in malignant GC tissues and cells compared to adjacent normal tissues and normal gastric cells (p < 0.001). Additionally, the expression levels of CREG were positively correlated with tumor clinical stage (p = 0.001), tumor metastasis (p < 0.001), and stages of tumor infiltration (p = 0.019). Furthermore, by using siRNA, we found that the down-regulated expression of CREG inhibited the proliferation of GC cells (p < 0.05), and migration of both GC cells (p = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data suggest that CREG plays an important role in gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis and that CREG may be a potential therapeutic target for GC. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79960225928	Effects of hypoxia on the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and miR-210 in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells	Objective: To investigate the potential effects of hypoxia on the expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and microRNA-210 (miR-210) in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, and to explore the possible mechanism of the change of miR-210 expression in tumor cells under the hypoxia microenvironment. Methods: HepG2 cells were routinely cultured in vitro, and then exposed to 1% oxygen for 6, 12, 18 and 24 h. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of HIF-1α mRNA and protein. The expression of miR-210 in HepG2 cells under hypoxia condition at different time was assessed by stem-loop RT-PCR. The correlation between the expression of miR-210 and HIF-1α was analyzed. Finally, the chromatin immunoprecitation PCR (ChIP-PCR) was used to verify the hypothesis that miR-210 was the target of HIF-1α in HepG2 cells. Results: The change of HIF-1α mRNA expression in HepG2 cells was obvious under hypoxia condition for 6-12 h (P<0.05), whereas the HIF-1α protein expression was significantly changed from the beginning of hypoxic culture through 24 h (P<0.005). Meanwhile, the expression of miR-210 showed great change under hypoxia condition for 6-18 h (P<0.01), which was in a linear correlation with the expression of HIF-1α (R=0.795, P=0.037). Moreover, ChIP-PCR assay showed that HIF-1α protein was bound to hypoxia response element (HRE) near transcriptional site in promoter region of miR-210 gene in HepG2 cells. Conclusion: The moderate hypoxia may affect the expression level of miR-210, and the possible mechanism may involve the HIF-1α protein bound to the promoter region of miR-210 gene.

81055124827	Expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a are regulated by GLI1 in human pancreatic cancer	Background and Aims: GLI1, as an indispensable transcriptional factor of Hedgehog signaling pathway, plays an important role in the development of pancreatic cancer (PC). DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) mediate the methylation of quantity of tumor-related genes. Our study aimed to explore the relationship between GLI1 and DNMTs. Methods: Expressions of GLI1 and DNMTs were detected in tumor and adjacent normal tissues of PC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). PANC-1 cells were treated by cyclopamine and GLI1-siRNA, while BxPC-3 cells were transfected with overexpression-GLI1 lentiviral vector. Then GLI1 and DNMTs expression were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blot (WB). Then we took chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to demonstrate GLI1 bind to DNMT1. Finally, nested MSP was taken to valuate the methylation levels of APC and hMLH1, when GLI1 expression altered. Results: IHC result suggested the expressions of GLI1, DNMT1 and DNMT3a in PC tissues were all higher than those in adjacent normal tissues (p<0.05). After GLI1 expression repressed by cyclopamine in mRNA and protein level (down-regulation 88.1±2.2%, 86.4±2.2%, respectively), DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA and protein level decreased by 91.6%±2.2% and 83.8±4.8%, 87.4±2.7% and 84.4±1.3%, respectively. When further knocked down the expression of GLI1 by siRNA (mRNA decreased by 88.6±2.1%, protein decreased by 63.5±4.5%), DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA decreased by 80.9±2.3% and 78.6±3.8% and protein decreased by 64.8±2.8% and 67.5±5.6%, respectively. Over-expression of GLI1 by GLI1 gene transfection (mRNA increased by 655.5±85.9%, and protein increased by 272.3±14.4%.), DNMT1 and DNMT3a mRNA and protein increased by 293.0±14.8% and 578.3±58.5%, 143.5±17.4% and 214.0±18.9%, respectively. ChIP assays showed GLI1 protein bound to DNMT1 but not to DNMT3a. Results of nested MSP demonstrated GLI1 expression affected the DNA methylation level of APC but not hMLH1 in PC. Conclusion: DNMT1 and DNMT3a are regulated by GLI1 in PC, and DNMT1 is its direct target gene. © 2011 He et al.

80855128148	Role of tetraspanins in liver cancer	Tetraspanins are a family of small cell surface proteins characterized by four highly conserved transmembrane domains, which are thought to be involved in the regulation of a broad range of functions, including cell growth, conglutination, and migration. The tetraspanin superfamily (TM4SF) may be associated with other cell surface proteins such as tetraspanins, integrin growth factor and its receptor, the HLA family, and MHCs. They form the tetraspanin web wherein tetraspanins form the cores. The tetraspanin web indirectly or directly affects conglutination, differentiation, migration, and metastasis of the cancer cell by signal pathway. Current research studies show that CD151, CD82, Tspan8, and Tspan1 are closely associated with liver cancer, which may affect the progress of liver cancer by regulating conglutination, migration, and metastasis of liver cancer cells. KAI1/CD82 is a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits the migration and metastasis of liver cancer cell by upregulating the level of its expression. CD151 is expressed widely in liver cancer, which shows the possible use of CD151 overexpression and c-Met overexpression in predicting the progression of liver cancer, and CD151 may be potential molecular therapeutic targets for liver cancer. The progression and the prognosis of liver cancer can be predicted using Tspan8 (CO-029) and Tspan1 (NET-1).

83355167048	Cyclopamine blocked the growth of colorectal cancer SW116 cells by modulating some target genes of Gli1 in vitro	Background/Aims: Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been considered as a therapy target for various cancer entities. However, its mechanism in colorectal cancer is still unclear. Methodology: We analyzed the expression of Hh pathway members in colorectal adenomas and cancer cell lines and then studied its relationship with survival of colorectal cancer cells through inhibiting Hh pathway by cyclopamine. Moreover, we studied the regulation of Gli1 on insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 (IGFBP6) and B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) genes at the level of transcription by XChIP and cyclopamine inhibition assay. Results: Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Smoothened (Smo), patched (Ptch) and Gli1 genes mRNA were expressed in SW116 cells. Gli1 bound to promoter regions of Bcl-2 and IGFBP6 genes, cyclopamine inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis through inhibiting the transcriptions of IGFBP6 (p=0.003), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (p=0.014) and Bcl-2 (p=0.013), and increasing that of BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) and BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak1) (p=0.003 and 0.001, respectively) in SW116 cells. Conclusions: Hh pathway is aberrant activation in part colorectal carcinomas cell lines and its inhibitor may be an effectual agent for colorectal cancer chemoprevention. It may be one of the mechanisms that Gli1 maintained cell survival by binding the promoter regions and facilitating transcription of IGFBP6 and Bcl-2 genes. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A.

84655176719	Down-regulation of miR-212 expression by DNA hypermethylation in human gastric cancer cells	There has been few report discussing the expression and function of miR-212 in gastric cancer (GC). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the expression of miR-212 in both gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cells and further explores the possible reasons for this change and the impact on the development of gastric cancer. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-212 in primary GC tissues, adjacent normal tissues, gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, SGC-7901, MKN-45, and normal gastric mucosa cell line GES. The expression of miR-212 was evaluated before and after treatment with methylation inhibitor-5-Aza-2′-deoxycitidine (5-Aza-dC), finally anti-miRNA and dual luciferase reporter assay were used to prove that MYC is a target gene of miR-212. The results showed that a significant reduction of miR-212 expression in GC tissues was observed compared to that in normal tissues (P = 0.002). At the same time, miR-212 expression level in normal gastric mucosa cell line GES was higher than that of in gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, SGC-7901, and MKN-45 (P = 0.015, 0.008, 0.044, respectively). Computer sequence analysis showed the hypermethylation of CpG islands(CPI) in the promoter regions of miR-212 led to the lower expression of miR-212 in gastric cell strains (BGC-823 and SGC-7901). MiR-212 expression was significantly recovered after treatment with methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-dC (P = 0.016, 0.000, 0.015, respectively). Then, the results of AMOs transfection and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Myc is a target of miR-212, which will be helpful to verify the function of miR-212 in carcinogenesis. The conclusion could be deduced from the study that decreased expression of miR-212 may be due to hypermethylation of CPI in gastric cancer cells, and miR-212 might act on the progression of gastric cancer through the potential target gene Myc. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84856764288	Protective effects of ulinastatin on acute liver failure induced by lipopolysaccharide/D-galactosamine	Background: Although treatment of acute liver failure has been improved significantly recently, the survival rate of acute liver failure is only 5-20%. Therefore, prevention and treatment of acute liver failure are still urgent issues in the field of liver disease. Aims: It has been demonstrated that ulinastatin could attenuate acute injury of internal organs from endotoxin. This study evaluates whether ulinastatin can prevent and/or attenuate acute liver failure induced by the combination of lipopolysaccharide and d-galactosamine (LPS/d-gal). Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were employed to induce acute liver failure by injection of LPS/d-gal. The liver function, inflammatory factors, oxidative stress index, and hepatic histopathological alteration were examined in the rats with and without ulinastatin treatment. Results: In rats treated with LPS/d-gal, there were increases in the levels of ALT and AST in the serum and levels of malondialdehyde and inducible nitric oxide synthase in liver tissues. Moreover, the levels of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were reduced in the liver. Furthermore, inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and apoptotic enzyme (caspase-3) were increased in the respective serum and liver of rats treated with LPS/d-gal. However, pre-treatment of ulinastatin significantly reversed all of these parameters in the rats that received LPS/d-gal alone. Conclusions: The finding in this study suggests that ulinastatin could be a potential agent for prevention and treatment of acute liver injury induced by LPS/d-gal. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84857014199	Efficacy of intraductal ultrasonography in the diagnosis of non-opaque choledocholith	AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of intraductal ultrasonography (IDUS) in the diagnosis ofnon-opaque, common bile duct stones. METHODS: A total of183 patients (102 males, mean age 73 years; 81 females, mean age 70 years) with suspected common bile duct stones diagnosed through abdominal computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and abdominal Type-B ultrasound were included in the study. The diagnosis was confirmed through endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by IDUS. RESULTS: A total of183 patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones were included in the study as follows: 36 patients with high-density CBDstones, 68 patients with sand-like stones, 44 patients with low-density stones, 21 patients with ampullary cancer, and 14 patients with pancreatic cancer. Conventional imaging revealed 124 cases ofcholedochectasia, and only 36 cases ofsuspected CBDstones; ERCP revealed 145 cases ofCBDstones with three missed diagnoses. IDUS revealed 148 cases ofCBDstones, 21 cases ofampullary tumors, and 14 cases ofpancreatic cancer. CONCLUSION: IDUS was more effective in the diagnosis ofbile duct stones than ERCP, upper abdominal CT or upper abdominal MRI. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84861014884	Modified sequential therapy regimen versus conventional triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer patients in China: A multicenter clinical comparative study	Objective. Antimicrobial resistance has decreased eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide. To observe the effect of eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the treatment of duodenal ulcer by 2 kinds of modified sequential therapy through comparing with that of 10-day standard triple therapy. Methods. A total of 210 patients who were confirmed in duodenal ulcer active or heal period by gastroscopy and H. pylori positive confirmed by rapid urease test, serum anti-H. pylori antibody (ELASE), or histological examination enrolled in the study. All the patients were randomly divided into three groups: group A (70 cases) and group B (70 cases) were provided 10-day modified sequential therapy; group C (70 cases) was provided 10-day standard triple therapy. Patients of group A received 20mg of Esomeprazole, 500mg of Clarithromycin for the first 5 days, followed by 20mg of Esomeprazole, 500mg of Clarithromycin, and 1000mg of Amoxicillin for the remaining 5 days. Group B received 20mg of Esomeprazole, 1000mg of Amoxicillin for the first 5 days, followed by 20mg of Esomeprazole, 500mg of Clarithromycin, and 1000mg of Amoxicillin for the remaining 5 days. Group C received 20mg of Esomeprazole, 500mg of Clarithromycin, and 1000mg of Amoxicillin for standard 10-day therapy. All drugs were given twice daily. H. pylori eradication rate was checked four to eight weeks after taking the medicine by using a 13C urea breath test. In the first, second, third, seventh, twenty-first, thirty-fifth days respectively, the symptoms of patients such as epigastric gnawing, burning pain, and acidity were evaluated simultaneously. Results. Overall, 210 patients accomplished all therapy schemes, 9 case patients were excluded. The examination result indicated that the H. pylori eradication rate of each group was as follows: group A 92.5 (62/67), group B 86.8 (59/68), and group C 78.8 (52/66). The H. pylori eradication rate of group A was slightly higher than group B (P 0.05) and both of them were obviously higher than group C (P 0.05). Modified sequential therapy was significantly more effective in patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains (80/67 versus 31; P=0.02). Symptoms improvement: all the three groups could improve the symptoms such as epigastric gnawing, burning pain, and acidity since the first day. There was no significant difference in total score descending of symptoms between each group (P 0.05). Conclusions. All the three therapy schemes could alleviate symptoms of duodenal ulcer patients in China efficiently. But as far as eradicating H. pylori is concerned, the modified sequential therapy was better than standard triple therapy, especially the therapy scheme used in group A. © 2012 Ying-Qun Zhou et al.

84862797630	miR-15b and miR-16 induce the apoptosis of rat activated pancreatic stellate cells by targeting Bcl-2 in vitro	Objectives: Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in the development of pancreatic diseases, especially chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. MicroRNAs have become a focal point of interest as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression via their interaction with the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs, which results in gene silencing. We examined the relative expression of microRNAs (miR-15b and miR-16) and their target gene, Bcl-2, during activation of rat PSCs, and determined their effects on apoptosis of rat PSCs in vitro. Methods: miR-15b and miR-16 expression levels were analyzed in quiescent and activated PSCs by stemloop RT-PCR. In addition, the effects of miR-15b and miR-16 on apoptosis of activated PSCs were investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 staining, and flow cytometry with annexin-V/propidium (PI) co-labeling. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl were also analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: During activation of PSCs, from the quiescent stage to activated stage, miR-15b and miR-16 were downregulated, while Bcl-2 expression was upregulated. Restoring intracellular miRNA levels by miR- 15b and miR-16 administration greatly reduced Bcl-2 protein levels, and significantly induced apoptosis in activated PSCs. Conclusions: miR-15b and miR-16 could induce apoptosis of rat PSCs by targeting Bcl-2. Copyright © 2012, IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier India, a division of Reed Elsevier India Pvt. Ltd.

84862670553	The improving effects on hepatic fibrosis of interferon-γ liposomes targeted to hepatic stellate cells	No satisfactory anti-fibrotic therapies have yet been applied clinically. One of the main reasons is the inability to specifically target the responsible cells to produce an available drug concentration and the side-effects. Exploiting the key role of the activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in both hepatic fibrogenesis and over-expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), we constructed targeted sterically stable liposomes (SSLs) modified by a cyclic peptide (pPB) with affinity for the PDGFR-β to deliver interferon (IFN)-γ to HSCs. The pPBSSLIFN-γ showed satisfactory size distribution. In vitro pPBSSL could be taken up by activated HSCs. The study of tissue distribution via living-body animal imaging showed that the pPBSSLIFN-γ mostly accumulated in the liver until 24h. Furthermore, the pPBSSLIFN-γ showed more significant remission of hepatic fibrosis. In vivo the histological Ishak stage, the semiquantitative score for collagen in fibrotic liver and the serum levels of collagen type IV-C in fibrotic rats treated with pPBSSLIFN-γ were less than those treated with SSLIFN-γ, IFN-γ and the control group. In vitro pPBSSLIFN-γ was also more effective in suppressing activated HSC proliferation and inducing apoptosis of activated HSCs. Thus the data suggest that pPBSSLIFN-γ might be a more effective anti-fibrotic agent and a new opportunity for clinical therapy of hepatic fibrosis. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84862781019	Resveratrol inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis through the hedgehog signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell	Purpose: To investigate the effect and possible mechanisms of resveratrol on pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. Methods: After being treated with resveratrol, cell viability, cell cycle phase distribution and apoptosis rate of pancreatic cancer cells were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometer, respectively. The effects of resveratrol on the Hedgehog pathway were studied by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. By interfering Gli1 expression in PANC-1 cells and overexpressing Gli1 in BxPC-3 cells, we detected the expressions of Gli1-targeted genes, such as Ptc1, CCND1 and BCL-2, compared with resveratrol experimental group. We further used the luciferase reporter assay to explore the correlation between resveratrol and Gli1. Results: Resveratrol inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Compared with control group, the cells in the G0/G1 phase and the apoptosis rate were significantly increased. Low concentration of resveratrol decreased the expression of the Hedgehog pathway members including Gli1, Ptc1 and Smo. The expression of downstream target genes of the Hedgehog pathway such as Gli1, Ptc1, CCND1 and BCL-2 were significantly decreased after 12.5 μM resveratrol treatment, which demonstrated a similar change of gene expression when Gli1 was knocked down by the RNAi technique in PANC-1 cells. Resveratrol also downregulated the expression of Gli1, Ptc1, CCND1 and BCL-2 in Gli1-overexpressed BxPC-3 cells. Results of the luciferase assay showed that resveratrol did not act on the Gli1 promoter directly. Conclusion: Resveratrol can inhibit pancreatic cancer cell survival and its mechanisms might be partly via the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel and IAP.

84863058057	Relationship between nonresolving inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor	OBJECTIVE: To summarize the research advancement of the relationship between nonresolving inflammation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in tumor, and discuss the role and probable mechanism of nonresolving inflammation in malignant transition of tumor cells. METHODS: By PubMed and CNKI retrieval system, with "epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), nonresolving inflammation and tumor microenvironment" as key words, papers from 2005-01 to 2010-12 were obtained. Twenty-six papers of literature are selected and analyzed according to the inclusion criteria as follows: 1) The relationship between nonresolving inflammation and tumor; 2) The relationship between nonresolving inflammation and EMT; 3) Mechanisms of EMT regulated by nonresolving inflammation. RESULTS: In nonresolving inflammatory status, inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β, TNF-α and ILs can initiate and maintain the EMT process of tumor cells, which enhances their invasive and migratory ability, by activating the transcription factors associated with EMT through NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, EMT promotes construction of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment. CONCLUSIONS: Nonresolving inflammation and EMT are tightly related in tumor, and inhibition of EMT through targeting the key components of the Nonresolving Inflammation-EMT signaling network probably be novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of tumor in the future.

Methodology: One hundred and sixteen patients who were confirmed duodenal ulcer active period and Hp positive were enrolled in the study. All the patients were divided into three groups: 3d group (n=39), 5d group (n=37) and 7d control group (n=40). All three groups were provided triple therapy first: rabeprazole, 10mg + furazolidone, 100mg + clarithromycin 250mg, twice a day for three days, five days and seven days, respectively. Then rabeprazole 10mg was provided once a day. Following the treatment, 13C urea breath test was performed to observe the Hp eradication rate. The symptoms of patients such as epigastralgia, burning pain and acidity were evaluated. Results: The Hp eradication rate was: 3d group 76% (28/37), 5d 89% (31/35) and 7d 91% (32/35). There was no significant difference between 5d and 7d group (p>0.05). But the rate of groups 5d and 7d was significantly higher than group 3d (p<0.05). All the three groups showed an improvement in symptoms such as epigastralgia, burning pain and acidity. Conclusions: All three therapy schemes could alleviate symptoms of duodenal ulcer patients efficiently. But as far as eradicating Hp concerned, 5d and 7d therapies were better than 3d. © H.G.E.

84863153557	L-cysteine administration attenuates pancreatic fibrosis induced by TNBS in rats by inhibiting the activation of pancreatic stellate cell	Background and Aims: Recent studies have shown that activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) play a major role in pancreatic fibrogenesis. We aimed to study the effect of L-cysteine administration on fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis (CP) induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in rats and on the function of cultured PSCs. Methods: CP was induced by TNBS infusion into rat pancreatic ducts. L-cysteine was administrated for the duration of the experiment. Histological analysis and the contents of hydroxyproline were used to evaluate pancreatic damage and fibrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of α-SMA in the pancreas was performed to detect the activation of PSCs in vivo. The collagen deposition related proteins and cytokines were determined by western blot analysis. DNA synthesis of cultured PSCs was evaluated by BrdU incorporation. We also evaluated the effect of L-cysteine on the cell cycle and cell activation by flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry. The expression of PDGFRβ, TGFβRII, collagen 1α1 and α-SMA of PSCs treated with different concentrations of L-cysteine was determined by western blot. Parameters of oxidant stress were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, IL-1β expression were evaluated in pancreas tissues by qRT-PCR. Results: The inhibition of pancreatic fibrosis by L-cysteine was confirmed by histological observation and hydroxyproline assay. α-SMA, TIMP1, IL-1β and TGF-β1 production decreased compared with the untreated group along with an increase in MMP2 production. L-cysteine suppressed the proliferation and extracellular matrix production of PSCs through down-regulating of PDGFRβ and TGFβRII. Concentrations of MDA+4-HNE were decreased by L-cysteine administration along with an increase in GSH levels both in tissues and cells. In addition, L-cysteine increased the mRNA expression of Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 and reduced the expression of IL-1β in L-cysteine treated group when compared with control group. Conclusion: L-cysteine treatment attenuated pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis in rats. © 2012 Yang et al.

84863930904	Development of a novel model of hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis in hamsters: Protective effects of probucol	Objectives The aim of the present study was to develop a model of hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) acute pancreatitis and to investigate the effects of probucol in this model. Methods: Hamsters were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or a normal diet for 3 weeks. Probucol was added at 1% to the HFD in the treated group. Pancreatitis was induced by 7 peritoneal injections of cerulein to the normal and HFD hamster groups. The severity of the pancreatitis and whole body oxidative stress were assessed. Results: The HFD induced severe HTG (>1000 mg/dL) in the hamsters. A more severe pancreatitis was observed in the HFD group. The HFD did not influence plasma-reduced glutathione level, but there was a significant increase after 1% probucol was provided in the diet. Plasma malonaldehyde levels in the HFD group were significantly higher than the normal chow group, whereas probucol administration significantly decreased plasma hydrogen peroxide and malonaldehyde levels. We also found that probucol significantly reduced levels of amylase and lipase in the plasma and pathological scores in pancreatic tissue. Conclusions: This study presents a novel model of severe HTG acute pancreatitis, and our results support the potential therapeutic application of probucol in HTG acute pancreatitis.

84865022723	Genome-wide screening reveals an EMT molecular network mediated by sonic hedgehog-Gli1 signaling in pancreatic cancer cells	Aims: The role of sonic hedgehog (SHH) in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of pancreatic cancer (PC) is known, however, its mechanism is unclear. Because SHH promotes tumor development predominantly through Gli1, we sought to understand its mechanism by identifying Gli1 targets in pancreatic cancer cells. Methods: First, we investigated invasion, migration, and EMT in PC cells transfected with lentiviral Gli1 interference vectors or SHH over-expression vectors in vitro and in vivo. Next, we determined the target gene profiles of Gli1 in PC cells using cDNA microarray assays. Finally, the primary regulatory networks downstream of SHH-Gli1 signaling in PC cells were studied through functional analyses of these targets. Results: Our results indicate there is decreased E-cadherin expression upon increased expression of SHH/Gli1. Migration of PC cells increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner within 24 hours of Gli1 expression (P<0.05). The ratio of liver metastasis and intrasplenic miniature metastasis increased markedly upon activation of SHH-Gli1 signals in nude mice. Using cDNA microarray, we identified 278 upregulated and 59 downregulated genes upon Gli1 expression in AsPC-1 cells. The data indicate that SHH-Gli1 signals promote EMT by mediating a complex signaling network including TGFβ, Ras, Wnt, growth factors, PI3K/AKT, integrins, transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF), and S100A4. Conclusion: Our results suggest that targeting the molecular connections established between SHH-Gli1 signaling and EMT could provide effective therapies for PC. © 2012 Xu et al.

84873599074	Effects of multiple-target anti-microRNA antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides on proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells	Backgrounds: To investigate the inhibiting effects of multi-target anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotide (MTg-AMOs) on proliferation and migration of human gastric cancer cells. Methods: Single anti-microRNA antisense oligonucleotides (AMOs) and MTg-AMOs for miR-221, 21, and 106a were designed and transfected into SGC7901, a gastric cancer cell line, to target the activity of these miRNAs. Their expression was analyzed using stem-loop RT-PCR and effects of MTg-AMOs on human gastric cancer cells were determined using the following two assay methods: CCK8 for cell proliferation and transwells for migration. Results: In the CCK-8 cell proliferation assay, 0.6 μmol/L was selected as the preferred concentration of MTg-AMOs and incubation time was 72 hours. Under these experimental conditions, MTg-AMOs demonstrated better suppression of the expression of miR-221, miR-106a, miR-21 in gastric cancer cells than that of single AMOs (P = 0.014, 0.024; 0.038, respectively). Migration activity was also clearly decreased as compared to those in randomized and blank control groups (28 ± 4 Vs 54 ± 3, P <0.01; 28 ± 4 Vs 59 ± 4, P < 0.01). Conclusions: MTg-AMOs can specifically inhibit the expression of multiple miRNAs, and effectively antagonize proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells promoted by oncomirs.

84873930517	Adjuvant probiotics improve the eradication effect of triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection	AIM: To investigate whether the addition of probiotics can improve the eradication effect of triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. METHODS: This open randomized trial recruited 234 H. pylori positive gastritis patients from seven local centers. The patients were randomized to one-week standard triple therapy (omeprazole 20 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, and amoxicillin 1000 mg bid; OCA group, n = 79); two weeks of pre-treatment with probiotics, containing 3 × 107 Lactobacillus acidophilus per day, prior to one week of triple therapy (POCA group, n = 78); or one week of triple therapy followed by two weeks of the same probiotics (OCAP group, n = 77). Successful eradication was defined as a negative C13 or C14 urease breath test four weeks after triple therapy. Patients were asked to report associated symptoms at baseline and during follow-up, and side effects related to therapy were recorded. Data were analyzed by both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) methods. RESULTS: PP analysis involved 228 patients, 78 in the OCA, 76 in the POCA and 74 in the OCAP group. Successful eradication was observed in 171 patients; by PP analysis, the eradication rates were significantly higher (P = 0.007 each) in the POCA (62/76; 81.6%, 95% CI 72.8%-90.4%) and OCAP (61/74; 82.4%, 95% CI 73.6%-91.2%) groups than in the OCA group (48/78; 61.5%, 95% CI 50.6%-72.4%). ITT analysis also showed that eradication rates were significantly higher in the POCA (62/78; 79.5%, 95% CI 70.4%-88.6%) and OCAP (61/77; 79.2%, 95% CI 70%-88.4%) groups than in the OCA group (48/79; 60.8%, 95% CI 49.9%-71.7%), (P = 0.014 and P = 0.015). The symptom relieving rates in the POCA, OCAP and OCA groups were 85.5%, 89.2% and 87.2%, respectively. Only one of the 228 patients experienced an adverse reaction. CONCLUSION: Administration of probiotics before or after standard triple therapy may improve H. pylori eradication rates. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84883166071	The hippo-yes association protein pathway in liver cancer	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer mortality. Despite continuing development of new therapies, prognosis for patients with HCC remains extremely poor. In recent years, control of organ size becomes a hot topic in HCC development. The Hippo signaling pathway has been delineated and shown to be critical in controlling organ size in both Drosophila and mammals. The Hippo kinase cascade, a singling pathway that antagonizes the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP), plays an important role in animal organ size control by regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis rates. During HCC development, this pathway is likely inactivated in tumor initiated cells that escape suppressive constrain exerted by the surrounding normal tissue, thus allowing clonal expansion and tumor development. We have reviewed evolutionary changes in YAP as well as other components of the Hippo pathway and described the relationships between YAP genes and HCC. We also discuss regulation of transcription factors that are up- and downstream of YAP in liver cancer development. © 2013 Lu Jie et al.

84886932248	Progress of the role of CD151 in the invasion and metastasis of digestive system cancers	OBJECTIVE: To summarize the research advancement of relationship between CD151 and digestive system cancers, and discuss the role and relative mechanism of the relationship of CD151 and tumor's invasion and metastasis in digestive system cancers. METHODS: By PubMed and CKNI retrieval system, with "CD151, digestive system cancers, integrin" as key words, papers from January 1991 to May 2012 were obtained. Twenty papers of literature were selected and analyzed according to the inclusion criteria as follows: 1. the function and structure of CD151; 2. the relationship between CD151 and digestive system cancers. RESULTS: As an important member of tetraspanins (transmembrane 4 superfanlily, TM4SF), CD151 is an important indicator related with invasion and metastasis in digestive system cancers. CD151 is highly expressed in tumor invasion and metastasis related gastric cencer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer and liver cancer. The mechanism which CD151 impart the invasion and metastasis in digestive system cancers might be related with MMPs, intergrin (such α5, β1 and β6) and other tetraspanins (such CD9, CD82 and CD81). CONCLUSIONS: CD151 is expressed in the different digestive system tumors and it is positively correlated with the metastasis and invasion of digestive system cancers. The CD151 might be expected to be a tumor markers in evaluating prognosis and molecular target therapy for digestive tumors.

84886563312	Protective effects of necrostatin-1 against concanavalin A-induced acute hepatic injury in mice	Objective. Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) inhibits receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase and programmed necrosis. This study was designed to examine the protective effects and mechanisms of Nec-1 in concanavalin A- (ConA-) induced hepatitis in mice. Methods. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ConA via tail vein injection and injected intraperitoneally with Nec-1 or vehicle. Levels of serum liver enzymes and histopathology were determined. Levels of inflammatory cytokines with ConA-induced hepatitis were determined with real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). The expression of TNF-α, RIP1, and LC3 was detected with immunohistochemical staining. The expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL2, IL6, caspase 3, RIP1, beclin-1, and LC3 protein was assessed by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Autophagosomes were observed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results. Amelioration in liver functions and histopathological changes and the suppression of inflammatory cytokine production were observed in Nec-1-injected mice. Western blotting analysis showed that the expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL2, IL6, and RIP1 was significantly reduced in the Nec-1-injected mice, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Autophagosome formation was significantly reduced by Nec-1 treatment, as the expression of beclin-1 and LC3, determined with immunofluorescence and western blotting. Conclusion. These results demonstrate that Nec-1 prevents ConA-induced liver injury via RIP1-related and autophagy-related pathways. © 2013 Yingqun Zhou et al.

84886953035	Epidemiology and prevention of hepatitis A in travelers	Background Hepatitis A is the second most common vaccine-preventable travel-associated infectious disease and hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the most common cause of viral hepatitis. The incidence of infection is closely related to sanitary conditions and the level of economic development. Methods We evaluated HAV incidence, infection-related risk factors, and HAV vaccination rates in international travelers through retrospective analyses using major databases, such as CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the current literature describing epidemiological data for HAV infection in recent years. Results and Conclusions We found that the incidence of HAV infection in developed countries is very low. As international travel increases, the incidence of hepatitis A among travelers remains high and likely leads to regional outbreaks. Travelers should visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website or Infectious Disease Prevention Center of their countries to learn about the incidence of infectious diseases associated with their destination before going abroad to determine if they should be vaccinated. © 2013 International Society of Travel Medicine.

84893744802	Ethyl pyruvate inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma via regulation of the HMGB1-RAGE and AKT pathways	Ethyl pyruvate (EP) was recently identified as a stable lipophilic derivative of pyruvic acid with significant antineoplastic activities. The high mobility group box-B1 (HMGB1)-receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and the protein kinase B (Akt) pathways play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and development of many malignant tumors. We tried to observe the effects of ethyl pyruvate on liver cancer growth and explored its effects in hepatocellular carcinoma model. In this study, three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines were treated with ethyl pyruvate. An MTT colorimetric assay was used to assess the effects of EP on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assays were used to analyze apoptosis. Real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence demonstrated ethyl pyruvate reduced the HMGB1-RAGE and AKT pathways. The results of hepatoma orthotopic tumor model verified the antitumor effects of ethyl pyruvate in vivo. EP could induce apoptosis and slow the growth of liver cancer. Moreover, EP decreased the expression of HMGB1, RAGE, p-AKT and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP9) and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ethyl pyruvate induces apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in G phase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, plays a critical role in the treatment of cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84894611536	Ethyl pyruvate pretreatment attenuates concanavalin A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice	Pharmacological Relevance: Ethyl pyruvate (EP), a potent reactive oxygen species scavenger, has been reported to contribute to the inflammatory process. However, the protective effect of ethyl pyruvate on Concanavalin A (Con A) -induced autoimmune hepatitis have not been explored. Thus, the aims of this study are to investigate both the effects of ethyl pyruvate and its mechanism of protection on Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice. Materials and Methods: Acute autoimmune hepatitis was induced by Con A (20 mg/kg) in Balb/C mice; ethyl pyruvate (40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg) was administrated 1h prior to the Con A injection. At 3h, 6h and 24h post Con A injection, histological grading, proinflammatory cytokine levels and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity were determined. Results: Following Con A challenge, cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β and IL-6 were expressed at 3h and 6h, and the level of HMGB1 significantly increased by 24h. Pretreatment with ethyl pyruvate ameliorated the pathological effects of Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis and significantly decreased the levels of TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-1β at 3h and 6h and the level of HMGB1 at 6h and 24h post injection. Ethyl pyruvate blocked the degradation of IκB α and IκB β and decreased the expression of NF-κB at 24h. Conclusion: Taken together, these results indicated that ethyl pyruvate protected against Con A-induced autoimmune hepatitis by decreasing both early (TNF-α, IL-2, IL-1β and IL-6) and late (HMGB1) cytokine expression in mice. The reduction of HMGB1 may correlate with the amelioration of NF-κB activity. © 2014 Shen et al.

84896321924	Ethyl pyruvate ameliorates hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by inhibiting intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and autophagy	Background. Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a pivotal clinical problem occurring in many clinical conditions such as transplantation, trauma, and hepatic failure after hemorrhagic shock. Apoptosis and autophagy have been shown to contribute to cell death in hepatic I/R injury. Ethyl pyruvate, a stable and simple lipophilic ester, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, the purpose is to explore both the effect of ethyl pyruvate on hepatic I/R injury and regulation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and autophagy. Methods. Three doses of ethyl pyruvate (20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 80 mg/kg) were administered 1 h before a model of segmental (70%) hepatic warm ischemia was established in Balb/c mice. All serum and liver tissues were obtained at three different time points (4 h, 8 h, and 16 h). Results. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and pathological features were significantly ameliorated by ethyl pyruvate (80 mg/kg). The expression of Bcl-2, Bax, Beclin-1, and LC3, which play an important role in the regulation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and autophagy, was also obviously decreased by ethyl pyruvate (80 mg/kg). Furthermore, ethyl pyruvate inhibited the HMGB1/TLR4/ NF-b axis and the release of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6). Conclusion. Our results showed that ethyl pyruvate might attenuate to hepatic I/R injury by inhibiting intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and autophagy, mediated partly through downregulation of HMGB1/TLR4/ NF-b axis and the competitive interaction with Beclin-1 of HMGB1. © 2013 Miao Shen et al.

84899897057	Protective effect of astaxanthin on liver fibrosis through modulation of TGF- β 1 expression and autophagy	Liver fibrosis is a common pathway leading to cirrhosis and a worldwide clinical issue. Astaxanthin is a red carotenoid pigment with antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of astaxanthin on liver fibrosis and its potential protective mechanisms. Liver fibrosis was induced in a mouse model using CCL4 (intraperitoneal injection, three times a week for 8 weeks), and astaxanthin was administered everyday at three doses (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg). Pathological results indicated that astaxanthin significantly improved the pathological lesions of liver fibrosis. The levels of alanine aminotransferase aspartate aminotransferase and hydroxyproline were also significantly decreased by astaxanthin. The same results were confirmed in bile duct liagtion, (BDL) model. In addition, astaxanthin inhibited hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) by decreasing the expression of NF- B and TGF- β 1 and maintaining the balance between MMP2 and TIMP1. In addition, astaxanthin reduced energy production in HSCs by downregulating the level of autophagy. These results were simultaneously confirmed in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our study showed that 80 mg/kg astaxanthin had a significant protective effect on liver fibrosis by suppressing multiple profibrogenic factors. © 2014 Miao Shen et al.

84901228026	The synergistic in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect of combination therapy with salinomycin and 5-fluorouracil against hepatocellular carcinoma	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the few cancers in which a continuous increase in incidence has been observed over several years. Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of HCC. In the present study, we used salinomycin (Sal) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) combination therapy on HCC cell lines Huh7, LM3 and SMMC-7721 and nude mice subcutaneously tumor model to study whether Sal could increase the sensitivity of hepatoma cells to the traditional chemotherapeutic agent such as 5-FU. The combination of Sal and 5-FU resulted in a synergistic antitumor effect against liver tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Sal reversed the 5-FU-induced increase in CD133(+) EPCAM(+) cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and activation of the Wnt/ b-catenin signaling pathway. The combination of Sal and 5-FU may provide us with a new approach to reverse drug resistant for the treatment of patients with HCC. © 2014 Wang et al.

84903603213	Association of STAT4 gene rs7574865G > T polymorphism with ulcerative colitis risk: Evidence from 1532 cases and 3786 controls	Introduction: Several studies have reported the relationship between the STAT4 rs7574865G > T polymorphism as a susceptibility factor to ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the results have been controversial. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to obtain the most reliable estimate of the association. Material and methods: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched. Crude odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted and pooled to assess the strength of the association between the STAT4 rs7574865G > T polymorphism and risk of UC. A total of five eligible studies including 1532 cases and 3786 controls based on the search criteria were involved in this meta-analysis. Results: We observed that the STAT4 rs7574865G > T polymorphism was significantly correlated with UC risk when all studies were pooled into the meta-analysis (the allele contrast model: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.02-1.25; the heterozygote codominant model: OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.04-1.43; the dominant model: OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.07-1.45). In the stratified analysis by ethnicity, significant associations were observed in Spanish for the allele contrast model (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.04-1.39), for the homozygote codominant model (OR = 1.57; 95% CI = 1.07-2.31), for the dominant model (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.01-1.43), and for the recessive model (OR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.03-2.19). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the STAT4 rs7574865G > T polymorphism is a low-penetrant risk factor for UC, especially in Spanish. © 2014 Termedia & Banach.

84904600213	15-Deoxy- γ 12,14-prostaglandin J2 reduces liver impairment in a model of ConA-induced acute hepatic inflammation by activation of PPAR γ and reduction in NF- B activity	Objective. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) reduces inflammation and has been identified as an anti-inflammatory prostaglandin in numerous animal models. In this study, we investigated both effects of 15d-PGJ2 and its protection mechanism in concanavalin A- (ConA-) induced autoimmune hepatitis in mice. Materials and Methods. In vivo, Balb/C mice were injected with ConA (25 mg/kg) to induce acute autoimmune hepatitis, and 15d-PGJ2 (10 g or 25 g) was administered 1 h before the ConA injection. The histological grade, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and NF-B and PPARγ activity were determined 6, 12, and 24 h after the ConA injection. In vitro, LO2 cells and RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 15d-PGJ2 (2 M) 1 h before the stimulation with ConA (30 g/mL). The NF-B and PPARγ activity were determined 30 min after the ConA administration. Results. Pretreatment with 15d-PGJ2 reduced the pathological effects of ConA-induced autoimmune hepatitis and significantly reduced the levels of cytokines after injection. 15d-PGJ2 activated PPARγ, blocked the degradation of IBα, and inhibited the translocation of NF-B into the nucleus. Conclusion. These results indicate that 15d-PGJ2 protects against ConA-induced autoimmune hepatitis by reducing proinflammatory cytokines. This reduction in inflammation may correlate with the activation of PPARγ and the reduction in NF-B activity. © 2014 Kan Chen et al.

84905001546	Sonic hedgehog-Gli1 signaling pathway regulates the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) by mediating a new target gene, S100A4, in pancreatic cancer cells	Aims: The hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in EMT of pancreatic cancer cells, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Because S100A4 as a key EMT moleculer marker was found to be upregulated upon Gli1 in pancreatic cancer cells, we focused on the relationship between Shh-Gli1 signals and S100 genes family. Methods: On the base of cDNA microarray data, we investigated regulating mechanism of Gli1 to some members of S100A genes family in pancreatic cancer cell lines firstly. Then, the regulation of Gli1 to S100A4 gene was studied by molecular biology assays and the pro-metastasis effection of Gli1-dependent S100A4 was investigated in vitro. Finally, the expressions of Shh, Gli1, S100A4 and E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer tissues were studied by using immunohistochemistry assays. Results: Five members of the S100 genes family, S100A2, S100A4, S100A6, S100A11, and S100A14 were found to be downregulated significantly upon Gli1 knockdown. Gli1 enhancer prediction combining with in vitro data demonstrated that Gli1 primarily regulates S100A family members via cis-acting elements. Indeed, the data indicate S100A4 and vimentin genes were upregulated significantly by Shh/Gli1-expression increasing and E-cadherin was significantly reduced at the same time. Migration of PC cells was increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner of Gli1 expression (P<0.05) and siS100A4 significantly reversed the response of PC cells induced by L-Shh transduction (P<0.01). Conclusion: Our data establish a novel connection between Shh-Gli1 signaling and S100A4 regulation, which imply that S100A4 might be one of the key factors in EMT mediated by Shh-Gli1 signaling in pancreatic cancer. © 2014 Xu et al.

84919723866	Meta-analysis of the efficacy of probiotics in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy	AIM: To evaluate the role of probiotics in the standard triple Helicobacter pylori therapy. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, we investigated the efficacy of probiotics in a standard triple H. pylori therapy in adults. Searches were mainly conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Fourteen studies met our criteria, and the quality of these studies was assessed using the Jadad scale. We used STATA version 12.0 to extract data and to calculate the odds ratios (ORs), which are presented with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The data are presented as forest plots. RESULTS: The pooled ORs for the eradication rates calculated by intention-to-treat analysis and perprotocol analysis in the probiotic group vs the control group were 1.67 (95%CI: 1.38-2.02) and 1.68 (95%CI: 1.35-2.08), respectively, using the fixed-effects model. The sensitivity of the Asian studies was greater than that of the Caucasian studies (Asian: OR = 1.78, 95%CI: 1.40-2.26; Caucasian: OR = 1.48, 95%CI: 1.06-2.05). The pooled OR for the incidence of total adverse effects was significantly lower in the probiotic group (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.26-0.94), using the random effects model, with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 85.7%). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly reduced in the probiotic group (OR = 0.21, 95%CI: 0.06-0.74), whereas the incidence of taste disorders, metallic taste, vomiting, nausea, and epigastric pain did not differ significantly between the probiotic group and the control group. CONCLUSION: Supplementary probiotic preparations during standard triple H. pylori therapy may improve the eradication rate, particularly in Asian patients, and the incidence of total adverse effects.
