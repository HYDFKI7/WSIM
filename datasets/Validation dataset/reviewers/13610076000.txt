33646830257	A KPN based cooperative composition model of services	KPN (Kahn Process Network) is a model of computation based on dataflow and commonly used for describing a set of cooperative processes that communicate with each other by means of dataflow. In this paper, we propose a KPN based cooperative composition model of services called CCM. The corresponding mapping mechanism of KPN to CCM is presented. CCM model aims at reducing unanticipated circumstances and uncooperative cases of services in service composition and improving chances of composition success. The data description and service description techniques adopted in CCM model is introduced in detail. Based on CCM model, a cooperative composition framework of services is designed.

33846861091	Multimedia object placement for transparent data replication	Transparent data replication is a promising technique for improving the system performance of a large distributed network. Transcoding is an important technology which adapts the same multimedia object to diverse mobile appliances; thus, users' requests for a specified version of a multimedia object could be served by a more detailed version cached according to transcoding. Therefore, it is particularly of theoretical and practical necessity to determine the proper version to be cached at each node such that the specified objective is achieved. In this paper, we address the problem of multimedia object placement for transparent data replication. The performance objective is to minimize the total access cost by considering both transmission cost and transcoding cost. We present optimal solutions for different cases for this problem. The performance of the proposed solutions is evaluated with a set of carefully designed simulation experiments for various performance metrics over a wide range of system parameters.

34250743090	CCML: A novel service composition language	This paper presents a novel service composition language called CCML. Its distinct advantage from conventional composition languages is its ability to describe behaviors of interacting services and the composition of these behaviors. Interaction rules among services rely on a cooperative computation model, i.e. KPN (Kahn Process Network), which adopts dataflow and channel based asynchronous communication pattern among process nodes. The employment of dataflow based computation model of KPN enables CCML to avoid complicated control flow mechanisms. Formal model for behavioral semantics of CCML is based on CCS process algebra which presents a high expressive power, capable of capturing CCML behavioral semantics. We give an operational semantics to CCML in the form of a labeled transition system (LTS).

38949203368	Modeling service interactions using Kahn process network	This paper proposed a Kahn Process Network(KPN) based service interaction model which can dynamically establish links between computational service nodes. Three advantages of KPN make it adequate to model service interactions: (1) parallelism and communication mechanism in KPNs, which enable distributed service interaction on internet; (2) KPNs are compositional, which corresponds to the possibility to build bigger behaviors from small ones; (3) KPN can be executed, which ensures a executable service interaction environment for actual application. Under the three advantages above, we propose four kinds of service interaction rules and corresponding interaction events which enrich KPN operations and extend KPN semantics. We design a service description language called SDL to describe both static properties and dynamic interactions of services. The implementation architecture of service interaction model is present.

In this paper, considering the homophily of relation to similar interests and similar friends, we propose a social item recommendation framework (SocItemRec). Our framework combines both global interest from the user-item information and local interest from social relation information for recommendations. We evaluate our framework on real world data from Sina Weibo, one of the most popular social network sites in China. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework leads to improved performance of top-k item recommendation. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.

84876046645	Time-aware social recommendation based on user feedback	Context information such as time, social relationship and user feedback information can be exploited to improve the quality of recommendation. However, most collaborative filtering based methods ignore this kind of information in social recommendation. In this paper, we propose a time-aware social recommendation method based on user feedback for top-k item recommendation in social networks. Our method incorporates the temporal factors by introducing a time weight function, which models the decay of user interest. Moreover, our method considers the user positive feedback and negative feedback information, as well as the social relationship information for recommendation. Empirical analysis and experiments are conducted in Sina Weibo, one of the most popular social network sites in China. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the collaborative filtering method in terms of MAP for top-k item recommendation. © 2005 - 2013 JATIT & LLS. All rights reserved.

84878016663	A novel active contour model for image segmentation using distance regularization term	In this paper, a novel active contour model (R-DRLSE model) based on level set method is proposed for image segmentation. The R-DRLSE model is a variational level set approach that utilizes the region information to find image contours by minimizing the presented energy functional. To avoid the time-consuming re-initialization step, the distance regularization term is used to penalize the deviation of the level set function from a signed distance function. The numerical implementation scheme of the model can significantly reduce the iteration number and computation time. The results of experiments performed on some synthetic and real images show that the R-DRLSE model is effective and efficient. In particular, our method has been applied to MR kidney image segmentation with desirable results. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84878752916	Time-aware recommendations in online social networks	Recommendation methods based on collaborative filtering techniques treat the contributions of user interest information equally, which implies that the user interest information is static and unchanged. Actually, the user interest information is changing over time in online social networks. In this paper, we propose a time-aware recommendation method for top-k item recommendation in online social networks. Our method incorporates the temporal factors by introducing a time weight function, which models the decay of user interest according to the intervals of time between the item clicks. Empirical studies are conducted in Sina Weibo, one of the most popular social network sites in China. The results show that our method outperforms the collaborative filtering method in terms of MAP for top-k item recommendation. © 2013 by Binary Information Press.

84883196623	CACOnt: A ontology-based model for context modeling and reasoning	In this paper, we present a general and extensible context-aware computing ontology (CACOnt) for modeling context and providing inference mechanisms. CACOnt provides not only the generic context ontologies for capturing basic concepts about context, but also the extensibility for adding domain-specific ontologies in a hierarchical manner. CACOnt facilitates the context reasoning capabilities by providing semantic logics which is possible to combine with rule-based systems. However, the set of rules cannot entirely cover the domain of contexts, we present a semantic similarity-based rule matching algorithm as the solution to this problem. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

84883264090	Trust-based top-k item recommendation in social networks	Collaborative filtering based methods have a low performance in the context of social recommendation due to the data sparsity issue and not considering the social network information that can be exploited to improve the performance. Trust-based methods attempt to reduce the data sparsity by utilizing the social network information. However, most of these methods are based on the explicit trust statements expressed by users, which are not available in the social networks such as Sina Weibo. In this paper, we present a trust metric to quantitatively measure the recommendation trust between pairs of users by aggregating the implicit trust and trust propagation values. We propose a trust-based latent factor model, which incorporates the pairwise recommendation trust values into the probabilistic model for top-k item recommendation. The experiments on Sina Weibo demonstrate that our method outperforms the collaborative filtering based methods and trust-based methods. © 2013 by Binary Information Press.

84883484294	Improved SPDS algorithm in BP network based on filled function method	To solve the problem that the BP network training algorithm is easy to fall into local minimal point, this paper designs a set of new filled function in view of its characteristic, which can be used to replace the objective function for search and improve the SPDS algorithm. The algorithm simulation test proves that, when the SPDS algorithm falls into local minimum point, the use of the filled function instead of objective function makes the algorithm avoid the fetters of minimum problem, and accelerates convergence to the global minimum point.

84886736875	A hybrid automatic rule generation method for providing context awareness	Context-aware applications have been attracting significant attention as an important approach for not only adapting their behaviors to the user's current situation, but also protecting the user from being disturbed with various kinds of devices and services while on their regular duty. However, most of the existing context-aware systems proactively provide information or services for users mainly depending on the rules which are manually defined by users or developers. In pursuit of automating rule generation, we present a hybrid method which explores both granular computing and decision tree methods. Then, an application case is demonstrated to illustrate the proposed method how to automatically generate context awareness rules. Finally, the results of a series of experiments show that the proposed method is adequate to automatically generate rules for providing context awareness. © 2013 Binary Information Press.

84891544766	Analysis of local minimum problem of SPDS algorithm in BP network	The local minimum problem of SPDS algorithm-the training algorithm of BP neural network, is studied. As one of SPDS algorithm features based on the single parameter dynamic searching algorithm is that the variables are searched one by one, this paper proves that the equivalence error function of each iteration is a quasi-convex function, and minimum points are presence and can be found out. The initial value set from which the iterative must be convergence is defined as the global minimum area, and according to the local minimum problems, L-SPDS algorithm is given. The global minimum area of the SPDS algorithm expanding along coordinate direction is the global minimum area of L-SPDS algorithm. The possibility that SPDS algorithm converges to the global minimum point greatly increases, which is proved by algorithm simulation test.
