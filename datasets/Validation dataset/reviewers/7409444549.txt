84946689579	Exploiting mobility for location promotion in location-based social networks	In this paper, we target the location promotion problem in location-based social networks (LBSNs). The location promotion problem is given a location, we select a set of users as seeds to influence as many users as possible who are likely to visit a selected location. Specifically, we model the location promotion problem as an influence maximization problem on a graph and explore the independent cascading diffusion model on the graph. To determine the propagation probability of the edges of our proposed graph, the relation between users and the selected location should be detected. A property of LBSN is that the major reason of users visiting a location is based on their mobility. Therefore, we propose a mobility model DMM (Distance-based Mobility Model) to model each user's mobility. DMM exploits random walk with restart and the power law property of users' movements. Based on DMM and the selected location, the propagation probability of edges can be derived. In the evaluation, we show the performance of our proposed algorithms on two real datasets.

30144443370	A wave equation migration method for receiver function imaging: 2. Application to the Japan subduction zone	The newly developed wave equation poststack depth migration method for receiver function imaging is applied to study the subsurface structures of the Japan subduction zone using the Fundamental Research on Earthquakes and Earth's Interior Anomalies (FREESIA) broadband data. Three profiles are chosen in the subsurface imaging, two in northeast (NE) Japan to study the subducting Pacific plate and one in southwest (SW) Japan to study the Philippine Sea plate. The descending Pacific plate in NE Japan is well imaged within a depth range of 50-150 km. The slab image exhibits a little more steeply dipping angle (∼32°) in the south than in the north (∼27°), although the general characteristics between the two profiles in NE Japan are similar. The imaged Philippine Sea plate in eastern SW Japan, in contrast, exhibits a much shallower subduction angle (∼19°) and is only identifiable at the uppermost depths of no more than 60 km. Synthetic tests indicate that the top 150 km of the migrated images of the Pacific plate is well resolved by our seismic data, but the resolution of deep part of the slab images becomes poor due to the limited data coverage. Synthetic tests also suggest that the breakdown of the Philippine Sea plate at shallow depths reflects the real structural features of the subduction zone, rather than caused by insufficient coverage of data. Comparative studies on both synthetics and real data images show the possibility of retrieval of fine-scale structures from high-frequency contributions if high-frequency noise can be effectively suppressed and a small bin size can be used in future studies. The derived slab geometry and image feature also appear to have relatively weak dependence on overlying velocity structure. The observed seismicity in the region confirms the geometries inferred from the migrated images for both subducting plates. Moreover, the deep extent of the Pacific plate image and the shallow breakdown of the Philippine Sea plate image are observed to correlate well with the depth extent of the seismicity beneath NE and SW Japan. Such a correlation supports the inference that the specific appearance of slabs and intermediate-depth earthquakes are a consequence of temperature-dependent dehydration induced metamorphism occurring in the hydrated descending oceanic crust.

30144445483	A wave equation migration method for receiver function imaging: 1. Theory	A wave equation-based poststack depth migration method is proposed to image the Earth's internal structure using teleseismic receiver functions. By utilizing a frequency wave number domain one-way phase screen propagator for wave field extrapolation in the migration scheme, common conversion point (CCP) stacked receiver functions are backward propagated to construct a subsurface structural image. The phase screen propagator migration method takes into account the effects of diffraction, scattering, and travel time alternation caused by lateral heterogeneities, and therefore it is particularly useful for imaging complex structures and deep discontinuities overlain by strong shallow anomalies. Synthetic experiments demonstrate the validity of the migration method for a variety of laterally heterogeneous models. The migrated images show considerable improvement over the CCP images in recovering the model features. Influences of several factors on the image quality of the poststack migration are further investigated, including interstation spacing, noise level of the data, velocity model used in migration, and earthquake distribution (incident direction of source fields). On the basis of the sampling theorem and previous statistic results, we discuss the relation of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the migrated image with the frequency of the data, surface station spacing and number of receiver functions used in stacking. We show that both CCP stacking and poststack migration of receiver functions need to be designed in a target-oriented way for reliable and efficient imaging. Our results also suggest that careful consideration of earthquake source distribution is necessary in designing seismic experiments aimed at imaging steeply dipping structures.

33745905915	Estimating link capacity in high speed networks	Knowledge of bottleneck capacity of an Internet path is critical for efficient network design, management, and usage. With emerging high speed Internet links, most traditional estimation techniques are limited in providing fast and accurate capacity estimations. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called PBProbe, to estimate high speed links. PBProbe is based on CapProbe; however, instead of solely relying on packet pairs, PBProbe employs a "packet bulk" technique and adapts the bulk length in order to overcome the well known problem with packet pair based approaches, namely the lack of accurate timer resolution. As a result, PBProbe not only preserves the simplicity and speed of CapProbe, but it also correctly estimates link capacities within a much larger range. Using analysis, we evaluate PBProbe with various bulk lengths and network configurations. We then perform emulation and Internet experiments to verify the accuracy and speed of PBProbe on high speed links. The results show that PBProbe is consistently fast and accurate in the great majority of test cases. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.

33749027786	Smooth and efficient real-time video transport in the presence of wireless errors	In this article we study a smooth and efficient transport protocol for real-time video over wireless networks. The proposed scheme, named the video transport protocol (VTP), has a new and unique end-to-end rate control mechanism that aims to avoid drastic rate fluctuations while maintaining friendliness to legacy protocols. VTP is also equipped with an achieved rate estimation scheme and a loss discrimination algorithm, both end-to-end, to cope with random errors in wireless networks efficiently. We show by analysis that VTP preserves most of the convergence properties of AIMD and converges to its fair share fast. VTP is compared to two recent TCP friendly rate control (TFRC) extensions, namely TFRC Wireless and MULTFRC, in wired-cum-wireless scenarios in Ns-2. Results show that VTP excels in all tested scenarios in terms of smoothness, fairness, and opportunistic friendliness. VTP is also implemented to work with a video camera and an H.263 video codec as part of our hybrid testbed, where its good performance as a transport layer protocol is confirmed by measurement results. © 2006 ACM.

33845673655	Receiver function migration image of the deep structure in the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China	We apply a receiver function poststack migration method to image the crustal and upper mantle structures beneath the Bohai Bay Basin, eastern China. The thick sediments of the basin appear to have a substantial influence on the migrated image of the deep structure. By using the surface reflected PpPs multiples instead of the commonly used Ps converted phases, a curved Moho is coherently imaged, showing a thinned crust of ∼30 km in the basin area compared with the >40-km thick crust in the west mountain range. By incorporating the sedimentary velocity model into migration, both the 410-km and the 660-km discontinuities present a simple structural feature with relatively flat topography within the basin's interior, although possible local structural complexities may exist at the base of the upper mantle around the boundary areas of the basin. The mantle transition zone is on average 10-15 km thicker than the global average, reflecting a cold lower upper mantle environment that is distinct from the warm shallow upper mantle of the region.

34247231708	Measuring effective capacity of IEEE 802.15.4 beaconless mode	IEEE 802.15.4 is an emerging wireless standard addressing the needs of Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks with a focus on enabling various pervasive and ubiquitous applications that require interactions with our surrounding environments. In view of the application potential of IEEE 802.15.4, knowing the fundamental network properties soon becomes essential in fasten the interactivity between these devices. Among all, knowing effective capacity of a path in wireless networks is of particular importance in routing and traffic management.

We present an implementation of SenProbe in Sensor Operating System (SOS), and evaluate the behavior/effectiveness of SenProbe in various testbed setups; including an interfered setting that cannot be simulated. Experiment results validate the workings of SenProbe and offer insights into how the capacity of a wire-less path changes in real wireless environments.

34250681129	A thinned lithospheric image of the Tanlu Fault Zone, eastern China: Constructed from wave equation based receiver function migration	We apply the newly proposed wave equation-based receiver function poststack migration method to the Northern China Interior Structure Project broadband data to image the lithospheric structure of the Tanlu Fault Zone area in eastern China. Our migration result reveals a 60- to 80-km-thick present-day lithosphere beneath the study region, significantly thinned from the Paleozoic lithosphere of > 180 km. The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) is coherently imaged along the ∼300-km-east-west profile, displaying an arc-like shape with its apex roughly coincident with the transverse location of the Tanlu Fault Zone on the surface. An obvious uplift from ∼36 km to ∼32 km of the Moho is also clearly detected right below this fault zone. The coincidence of the imaged Moho uplift and the LAB apex with the surface location of the Tanlu Fault Zone provides seismological evidence for the steep geometry and deep penetration of the fault system, and indicates that the Tanlu Fault Zone might have acted as a major channel for anthenosphere upwelling during the Mesozoic-Cenozoic continental extension and lithospheric thinning in eastern China. Frequency analysis and synthetic modeling suggest that both the Moho and the LAB are sharp and strong. The latter, in particular, is constrained to have a 3-7% drop in S wave velocity over a depth range of 10 km or less. Such a rapid velocity change at the base of the lithosphere in the study region cannot be solely explained by thermal variation, but likely reflects the presence of volatiles or melt in the asthenosphere, or is partially attributed to the compositional contrast between the preserved depleted and dehydrated cratonic lithospheric veneer and the uplifted hydrated and fertile asthenospheric materials.

34548137010	Impact of node heterogeneity in ZigBee mesh network routing	Based on the IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN standard, the ZigBee standard has been proposed to interconnect simple, low rate, and battery powered wireless devices. The deployment of ZigBee networks is expected to facilitate numerous applications, such as home-appliance networks, home healthcare, medical monitoring, consumer electronics, and environmental sensors. An effective routing scheme in a ZigBee network is particularly important in that it is the key to achieve resource (e.g., bandwidth and energy) efficiency in ZigBee networks. Routing in a ZigBee network is not exactly the same as in a MANET. In particular, while Full Function Devices (FFD) can serve as network coordinators or network routers, Reduced Function Devices (RFD) can only associate and communicate with FFDs in a ZigBee network. Therefore, different from traditional MANET routing algorithms, which only take into account node mobility to figure out a best route to a given destination, node heterogeneity plays an important role in ZigBee network routing. In this paper, we perform extensive evaluation, using NS-2 simulator, to study the impact of node heterogeneity on ZigBee mesh network routing. The results show that the ZigBee mesh routing algorithm exhibits significant performance difference when the network is highly heterogenous. We also reveal that the node type and the role of the node plays a critical role in deciding routing performances. © 2006 IEEE.

37249052285	Integrity-aware bandwidth guarding approach in P2P networks	Most Internet-based collaborative computing systems face the major problem: freeriding. The abundance of freeriders, and load imbalance it creates, punishes those peers who do actively contribute to the network by forcing them to overuse their resources. Hence, the overall system performance becomes to degrade quickly. The goal of this paper is aimed to provide an efficient approach to distinguish the dishonest peers from the honest peers. The key idea of our approach is to make use of the relationship between the perceived throughput and the available bandwidth. First, we do a comprehensive study of available bandwidth estimation tools. Next, we propose integrity-aware bandwidth guarding algorithm, which is designed according to the perceived throughput and the available bandwidth estimation. Finally, the simulation results illustrate that our approach can correctly identify dishonest peers and be of great help in constructing a better overlay structure for many peer-to-peer and multicast applications. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.

38149026318	On using probabilistic forwarding to improve HEC-based data forwarding in opportunistic networks	In this paper, we propose the HEC-PF scheme, an enhancement of our previous H-EC scheme for effective data forwarding in opportunistic networks. The enhanced scheme modifies the aggressive forwarding phase of the H-EC scheme by implementing a new Probabilistic Forwarding feature, which decides whether to forward a message to a newly encountered node based on the delivery probability. Using simulations as well as realistic network traces, we evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of delivery latency and completion ratio. The results show that the HEC-PF scheme outperforms the EC and H-EC schemes in all test cases, and the performance gain is even more substantial when network connectivity is extremely poor. By varying the parameters of the HEC-PF scheme, we show that its completion ratio improves as the maximum forwarding distance or the hop distance considered when calculating the delivery probability increases. The effectiveness of the HEC-PF scheme makes it an ideal solution that goes a long way toward ensuring effective data delivery in opportunistic networks. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.

39049144332	Ad-hoc Storage Overlay System (ASOS): A delay-tolerant approach in MANETs	Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) are most useful in unprepared emergencies where critical applications must be launched quickly. However, they often operate in an adverse environment where end-to-end connectivity is highly susceptible to disruption. Adjusting the motion of existing nodes or deploying additional nodes can improve the connectivity under some circumstances, but for scenarios where connectivity cannot be immediately improved, disruption must be coped with properly. In this paper we propose the Ad-hoc Storage Overlay System (ASOS). ASOS is a self-organized overlay of storage-abundant nodes to jointly provide distributed and reliable storage to data flows under disruption. ASOS is a Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) approach that significantly improves the applicability of MANETs in practice. © 2006 IEEE.

34247373501	A hybrid routing approach for opportunistic networks	With wireless networking technologies extending into the fabrics of our working and operating environments, proper handling of intermittent wireless connectivity and network disruptions is of significance. As the sheer number of potential opportunistic application continues to surge (i.e. wireless sensor networks, underwater sensor networks, pocket switched networks, transportation networks, and etc.), the design for an effective routing scheme that considers and accommodates the various intricate behaviors observed in an opportunistic network is of interest and remained desirable. While previous solutions use either replication or coding techniques to address the challenges in opportunistic networks, the tradeoff of these two techniques only make them ideal under certain network scenarios. In this paper, we propose a hybrid scheme, named H-EC, to deal with a wide variety of opportunistic network cases. H-EC is designed to fully combine the robustness of erasure coding based routing techniques, while preserving the performance advantages of replication techniques. We evaluate H-EC against other similar strategies in terms of delivery ratio and latency, and find that H-EC offers robustness in worst-case delay performance cases while achieving good performance in small delay performance cases. We also discuss the traffic overhead issues associated with H-EC as compared to other schemes, and present several strategies that can potentially alleviate the traffic overhead of H-EC schemes.

58049131271	Involuntary information leakage in social network services	Disclosing personal information in online social network services is a double-edged sword. Information exposure is usually a plus, even a must, if people want to participate in social communities; however, leakage of personal information, especially one's identity, may invite malicious attacks from the real world and cyberspace, such as stalking, reputation slander, personalized spamming and phishing. Even if people do not reveal their personal information online, others may do so. In this paper, we consider the problem of involuntary information leakage in social network services and demonstrate its seriousness with a case study of Wretch, the biggest social network site in Taiwan. Wretch allows users to annotate their friends' profiles with a one-line description, from which a friend's private information, such as real name, age, and school attendance records, may be inferred without the information owner's knowledge. Our analysis results show that users' efforts to protect their privacy cannot prevent their personal information from being revealed online. In 592,548 effective profiles that we collected, the first name of 72% of the accounts and the full name of 30% of the accounts could be easily inferred by using a number of heuristics. The age of 15% of the account holders and at least one school attended by 42% of the holders could also be inferred. We discuss several potential means of mitigating the identified involuntary information leakage problem. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

58149523732	AdHoc Probe: end-to-end capacity probing in wireless ad hoc networks	Knowledge of end-to-end path capacity is useful for video/audio stream adaptation, network management and overlay design. Capacity estimation in wired and last-hop wireless networks has been extensively investigated, but a thorough and systematic study in ad hoc, multihop wireless networks is still lacking. Yet the rate of a wireless link can change dynamically (and rapidly) due to changes in interference, distance or energy optimization policy. Timely knowledge of path capacity is key to efficient routing, traffic management and application deployment. In this paper, we present AdHoc Probe, a packet-pair based technique, to estimate end-to-end path capacity in ad hoc wireless networks. We apply AdHoc Probe to path capacity estimation in auto rate wireless networks with variable displacement and interference; and, in remote wireless networks across the Internet. Using analysis, simulation and testbed experiments, we show AdHoc Probe can withstand mobility and is able to trace the rate adaptation of wireless networks timely and correctly. AdHoc Probe is simpler, faster and much less intrusive than current schemes. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77954474076	User-centric radio power control for opportunistic mountain hiking networks	Saving DTNs' battery power to prolong the system life time has been an important research topic which scientists try to optimize. Most researches fall into two categories - Time Division Multiple Access based ones, and Low Power Listening ones by turning the listener's radio on/off intermittenly with long sending preambles. In this paper we propose solving the problem from a whole new angle - by using the motes' physical behavior, which is detectable by relatively energy-cheap accelerometer, as the judgment for turning the radio on/off. This scheme can be used in combination with any energy efficient DTN MAC protocols. We evaluate the protocol by running simulations with real hikers' traces and the result is shown in the evaluation section. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

PRoPHET+ computes a deliverability value to determine the routing path for packets. Deliverability is calculated using a weighted function consisting of evaluations of nodes' buffer size, power, location, popularity, and the predictability value from PRoPHET. Even though the proposed PRoPHET+'s weights are chosen based on qualitative considerations, it is possible for PRoPHET+ to perform even more efficiently in various environments by shifting the weights accordingly. Our simulation illustrates that PRoPHET+ can perform better or equal to the routing protocol PRoPHET if logical choices for weights are used. © 2010 IEEE.

84861906292	The design and evaluation of task assignment algorithms for GWAP-based geospatial tagging systems	Geospatial tagging (geotagging) is an emerging and very promising application that can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information, and thereby facilitate the development of advanced location-based services. Conventional geotagging systems share some limitations, such as the use of a two-phase operating model and the tendency to tag popular objects with simple contexts. To address these problems, a number of geotagging systems based on the concept of 'Games with a Purpose' (GWAP) have been developed recently. In this study, we use analysis to investigate these new systems. Based on our analysis results, we design three metrics to evaluate the system performance, and develop five task assignment algorithms for GWAP-based systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations under both synthetic and realistic mobility scenarios, we find that the Least-Throughput-First Assignment algorithm (LTFA) is the most effective approach because it can achieve competitive system utility, while its computational complexity remains moderate. We also find that, to improve the system utility, it is better to assign as many tasks as possible in each round. However, because players may feel annoyed if too many tasks are assigned at the same time, it is recommended that multiple tasks be assigned one by one in each round in order to achieve higher system utility. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

84887905940	Landmark-based self-healing service recovery for distributed pub/sub services on disaster management and M2M systems	How to exchange information between parties in a disaster management system is one of the fundamental challenges to support timely and efficient disaster response and relief. Specifically, the timeliness, scalability, and availability are three desirable features for information exchange. We call the framework to support information exchange with the three features an Open Information Gateway (OIGY). In this paper, we present the challenges of information gateway and the design of the communication protocols and landmark-based service recovery mechanism to support the aforementioned features. The mechanism aims at recovering the real-time publish and subscription services within an affected region. The developed method allows a landmark service node to monitor pub/sub service within a region, rather than the entire pub/sub network. To evaluate the performance of the service-recover mechanism, we measured its transmission and recovery overhead under different number of message brokers in the network. © 2013 WIT Press.

In this paper, we study the coexistence issue between various IEEE 802.15 based WPAN technologies. We present analytical models on the non-conflicting channel allocation probabilities, focusing on the coexistence scenarios of one WPAN technology coexisting with another. The results show that channel allocation conflicts occurs frequently in all cases, and is especially severe between IEEE 802.15.3 and IEEE 802.15.4 networks. On the other hand, the probability of non-conflict channel allocation is less dramatic between a single IEEE 802.15.1 and coexisting IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

42549120274	An enhanced Digital Content Mediator (DCM) approach to implementing legitimate and secure P2P online transactions	In this paper we enhance the Digital Content Mediator (DCM) approach, a legitimate online service that uses financial incentives as an effective weapon to fight against online piracy. We provide needed network security support for the DCM service. The DCM mediator is a trusted notary to ensure fair and legitimate deals between digital content selling peers and buying peers. (1) In our design, the mediator sees no raw bits of digital contents. This saves storage and communication resource for the central mediator. (2) For the seller and buyer in a DCMlegitimized transaction, one wants payment and the other wants the content. The DCM protocol ensures that neither of them can stop the protocol in the middle to steal its service without serving the other party. (3) A digital content may have many legitimate copies from large amount of sellers. In a large-scale random network like the Internet, transaction fairness is defined as the condition that a buyer wants to buy the copy from the seller with shortest downloading delay (i.e., largest seller-to-buyer pairwise bandwidth) given the same amount of financial charge. DCM employs flow network security countermeasures to ensure that a seller keeps its bandwidth promises. Our experiments on the Internet confirm the effectiveness of our design. © 2006 IEEE.

44649087051	A content-centric framework for effective data dissemination in opportunistic networks	In this paper, we address the challenges of content transfer in opportunistic networks, and propose techniques to better facilitate data dissemination based on the characteristics of the content. To investigate this problem from its origins, we propose three message scheduling algorithms: Sequential Forwarding (SF), Full Interleaving (FI), and Block-based Interleaving (BI). Each algorithm is embedded in a specially tailored data dissemination technique to evaluate the benefits of applying it to different types of content and data dissemination methods. Three types of content (file, video and web) are considered and evaluated, and the dissemination methods considered are Layered Multiple Description Coding (LMDC) based and file-based. Using simulations as well as both synthetic and realistic network scenarios, we evaluate the proposed schemes in terms of latency and user perceived quality, and demonstrate how the schemes can achieve much better latency performance for file transfers. Furthermore, we show that using LMDC-based techniques leads to higher user perceived quality, since the end user is allowed to "preview" video file or web content, even before the data has been completely transferred. The effectiveness and robustness of our message scheduling algorithms and their corresponding content dissemination techniques make them ideal solutions that can go a long way toward effective data dissemination in opportunistic networks. © 2008 IEEE.

48649096734	A machine learning-based approach for estimating available bandwidth	In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based approach for estimating available bandwidth. We evaluate the approach via simulations using two probing models: a packet train probing model and a pathChirp-like probing model. The simulation results show that the former cannot yield accurate estimates in our system; however, using the pathChirp-like probing model, the proposed approach can estimate the available bandwidth with moderate traffic overhead more accurately than two widely used tools, pathChirp and Spruce. Moreover, we propose a normalization method that improves our approach's ability to estimate available bandwidth, even if there are no samples with similar properties to the measured path in the training dataset. The effectiveness and simplicity of this novel approach make it a promising scheme that goes a long way toward achieving accurate estimation of available bandwidth on Internet paths. ©2007 IEEE.

48849115427	Improving bluetooth EDR data throughput using FEC and interleaving	Wireless communication is inherently vulnerable to errors from the dynamic wireless environment. Link layer packets discarded due to these errors impose a serious limitation on the maximum achievable throughput in the wireless channel. To enhance the overall throughput of wireless communication, it is necessary to deploy link layer transmission schemes that is robust to the errors intrinsic to the wireless channel. In this paper, we investigated the impact of three link layer enhancement techniques on the new Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) mode detailed in the new Bluetooth spec v2.0. We first studied the APT algorithm, and used it to obtain the optimal packet type for different bit error rates. We then evaluated FEC/IFEC coding schemes for the new EDR packet types, assessed their ability to alleviate the impact of burst errors, and discussed the tradeoffs. Using analysis and simulation, we show that the performance of the new Bluetooth EDR mode can be significantly improved when FEC and/or IFEC techniques are employed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

To tailor efficient transmission schemes, it is essential to develop a wireless error model that can provide insight into the behavior of wireless transmissions. In this study, we investigate the wireless error model of Bluetooth networks. We study the FHSS feature of Bluetooth using both ordinary hopping kernels and Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) kernels, and design analytical error models accordingly to capture the channel behavior of Bluetooth networks. We evaluate the proposed models by comparing the analytical results to the simulation results obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

50249141181	Performance study of routing schemes in delay tolerant networks	In conventional networks, such as the Internet, it is assumed that there exists a fully connected path between any pair of nodes at any time. In Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN), however, the connected path may be broken, and nodes may be partitioned into two disconnected subsets because of the movement or failure of some nodes. Thus, the data transmission requirements can not be satisfied by traditional routing schemes. How to efficiently route data in DTNs has therefore become a critical and challenging issue. To address the problem, we propose a contact-duration-based probabilistic routing scheme (PR_CD) based on the probabilistic routing scheme PRoPHET[16] (PR). Each node in the PR_CD scheme predicts the current network condition by using contact information, and then chooses appropriate relay nodes to improve the delivery rate as well as reduce the transmission latency and transmission overhead. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, we use simulations to conduct a comprehensive study of different DTN routing mechanisms. We believe such a study is important because the ability to characterize the behavior and performance of routing schemes plays a key role in the understanding and design of DTNs. © 2008 IEEE.

54949124163	PBProbe: A capacity estimation tool for high speed networks	Knowledge about the bottleneck capacity of an Internet path is critical for efficient network design, management, and usage. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called PBProbe, for estimating high speed links rapidly and accurately. Although it is based on CapProbe, instead of relying solely on packet pairs, PBProbe employs the concept of "Packet Bulk" and adapts the bulk length to compensate for the well known problem with packet pair-based approaches, namely the lack of accurate timer granularity. As a result, PBProbe not only preserves the simplicity and speed of CapProbe, but also correctly estimates link capacities over a much larger range. Using analysis, we evaluate PBProbe with various bulk lengths, network configurations, and traffic models. We then perform a set of experiments to evaluate the accuracy of PBProbe on the Internet over wired and wireless links. Finally, we perform emulation and Internet experiments to verify the accuracy and speed of PBProbe on high speed links (e.g., the Gigabit Ethernet connection). The results show that PBProbe is consistently fast and accurate in the majority of test cases. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

57349158426	Scalable and collaborative internet access for opportunistic people networks	We propose a Scalable and Collaborative Internet Access approach, called SCIA, for mobile web surfing. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed scheme implements a Collaborative Forwarding algorithm that takes advantage of opportunistic wireless connections, and thus improves network capacity by exploiting the diversity of network mobility. Moreover, using the Layered Multiple Description Coding (LMDC) algorithm, the SCIA scheme allows the end user to 'preview' the web content, even before the data has been completely transferred. Using simulations as well as realistic opportunistic people network scenarios, we demonstrate that the SCIA scheme provides a better web surfing service than traditional schemes, and thus facilitates more effective web surfing on the go.

57349200235	An evaluation study of routing reliability in opportunistic networks	An opportunistic network is a type of challenged network that has attracted increasing attention recently. While a number of schemes have been proposed to facilitate data forwarding in opportunistic networks, an implicit assumption is made in common that each participating peer is collaborative in the network. Consequently, these schemes become vulnerable when there exist uncooperative peers in the network. In this study, we evaluate two widely used routing schemes in opportunistic networks with three types of uncooperative behaviors, namely free riders, black holes, and wormholes. Using simulation as well as realistic network scenarios, we show that the data forwarding performance degrades significantly as the number of free riders increases. Moreover, we show that the epidemic scheme is more resilient against black holes than the PROPHET scheme, while both schemes are robust against wormholes.

62749097900	Lithospheric structure variations between the eastern and central North China Craton from S- and P-receiver function migration	I imaged the lithospheric structure beneath the Bohai Bay Basin (BBB) in the eastern North China Craton (NCC) and the Taihang Mountains (TM) and areas further to the west in the central NCC by applying the wave equation migration technique to both the S- and P-receiver functions (RFs) collected in this region. The data images and synthetic modeling results indicate that S-RF imaging is more appropriate than P-RF imaging for mapping lithospheric discontinuities, especially the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) in various types of regions, even directly applicable to basin areas that are covered by thick sediments. The constructed S-RF images show that the lithospheric thickness of the study region is highly variable. The imaged LAB is on average ∼80 km beneath the BBB, and displays obvious undulations from ∼120 km under the TM to <90 km further west in the central NCC. A rapid change of ∼30 km in the LAB depth was detected at around the boundary between the BBB and the TM, roughly coincident with the distinct gravity decrease of more than 100 mGal that marks the North-South Gravity Lineament (NSGL) in the region. The S-RF images also revealed a generally thin crust (∼30 km) beneath the basin in the eastern NCC and a thicker one (>40 km) under the mountain areas in the central NCC, consistent with previous P-RF imaging results. The observed structural differences between the eastern and central NCC are likely associated with different lithospheric tectonics in these two regions. While widespread lithosphere reactivation and extension in the eastern NCC during the late Mesozoic time was plausibly responsible for both the thinned crust and lithosphere in the BBB, lithospheric thinning in the central NCC may be equally heterogeneous but less significant, and probably occurred mainly in Cenozoic. Such a process may have given rise to the highly variable present-day lithospheric thickness in this region. However, it probably did not noticeably affect the overlying crust that was reported to have thickened in response to the early magmatic underplating in the Mesozoic time. The different tectonic processes in the eastern and central NCC may have induced the formation of the NSGL, which likely serves as a major tectonic boundary separating the two regions of contrasting lithospheric structures at present. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

62949094024	An analytical approach to optimizing the utility of ESP games	In this paper, we propose an analytical model for computing the utility of ESP games, i.e., the throughput rate of appropriate labels for given puzzles. The model targets generalized games, where the number of players, the consensus threshold, and the stopping condition are variable. Via extensive simulations, we show that our model can accurately predict the stopping condition that will yield the optimal utility of an ESP game under a specific setting. A service provider can therefore utilize the model to ensure that the hosted ESP games produce high-quality labels efficiently, given that the number of players willing to invest time and effort in the game is limited. © 2008 IEEE.

62949138685	An analytical study of Puzzle Selection strategies for the ESP game	"Human Computation" represents a new paradigm of applications that take advantage of people's desire to be entertained and produce useful metadata as a by-product. By creating games with a purpose, human computation has shown promise in solving a variety of problems that computer computation cannot currently resolve completely. Using the ESP game as an example, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of human computation systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of the ESP game. We argue that human computation systems should be played with a strategy. To this end, we implement an Optimal Puzzle Selection Strategy (OPSA) based on our analysis to improve human computation. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of the ESP game, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large. © 2008 IEEE.

70349486001	YushanNet: A delay-tolerantwireless sensor network for hiker tracking in yushan national park	The objective of YushanNet is to provide a reliable and robust system for hiker tracking in Yushan National Park, Taiwan. The aggregated information can help national parks to provide various services to tourists, and the collected hiking traces can provide more precise information to professional rescue teams if there are hikers lost in the mountains. YushanNet is a delay and disruption tolerant system. In the system, each hiker is required to carry a matchbox-size device, which consists of a ZigBee-based mote and a GPS receiver, and the device records its hiking trace, along with encounter information with other devices. Then, the recorded data is disseminated in the network in a store-carry-and- forward fashion, until it reaches one of the base stations along the trail. In this demo, we will present the design, implementation, and deployment of the YushanNet system, and we will demonstrate the system using a small-scale network scenario. © 2009 IEEE.

70349496546	XD: A cross-layer designed data collection mechanism for mission-critical WSNs in urban buildings	As the R&D experience accumulates, there is a rising interest of wireless sensor network (WSN) deployment in the urban environment. For mission critical applications such as healthcare and workplace safety, in particular, it is essential that the data dissemination mechanisms satisfy two important quality of service (QoS) requirements: (1) high delivery rate and (2) low transmission delay. Proposed in this work is a cross-layer designed data dissemination mechanism, referred to as Cross-Layer Diffusion (XD), in which notions in the path discovery (routing) component are exploited by data forwarding (MAC) component to improve the delivery rate and transmission delay. Using traces collected from a prototype WSN deployed in urban environment, we compare XD to the state-of-the-art mechanisms and find that XD is not only more efficient but also more practical. © 2009 IEEE.

70349506850	An evaluation of routing reliability in non-collaborative opportunistic networks	An opportunistic network is a type of challenged network that has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. While a number of schemes have been proposed to facilitate data dissemination in opportunistic networks, there is an implicit assumption that each participating peer behaves collaboratively. Consequently, these schemes may be vulnerable if there are uncooperative or malicious peers in the network. In this study, we identify five types of non-collaborative behavior, namely free rider, black hole, supernova, hypernova, and wormhole behavior, in opportunistic networks. We also evaluate the impacts of the five types of behavior on the data transmission performance of three widely used routing schemes. Using simulations as well as real-world traces of network mobility, we show that the data forwarding performance degrades significantly as the number of non-collaborative peers, except worm-holes, increases. Moreover, we find that the three compared routing schemes can benefit from wormhole behavior, especially when the network connectivity is poor and the buffer size is limited. © 2009 IEEE.

70349434874	Discontinuity structure of the mantle transition zone beneath the North China Craton from receiver function migration	A better understanding of the significant Phanerozoic tectonic reactivation and destruction ofthe North China Craton (NCC) demands a detailed knowledge ofthe deep structural features of the region. We applied the wave equation-based poststack migration technique to a combined receiver function data set from more than 250 broadband seismic stations to construct the structural image of the mantle transition zone beneath the NCC. Our imaging results reveal a relatively simple and flat 410-km discontinuity but a structurally complicated 660-km discontinuity beneath the region. Double discontinuities and a ∼30-km depression ofthe 660-km discontinuity are observed locally in the southern part of the eastern NCC, in contrast to the smoothly varying structure to the north and in the central and western parts ofthe craton. Distinctly rapid variations in both the 660-km discontinuity structure and mantle transition zone thickness were found across the northsouth gravity lineament (NSGL) near the boundary between the eastern and central NCC, which probably reflects different thermal and probably chemical properties on the two sides of the NSGL. These differences are possibly associated with the Pacific slab, which is imaged tomographically as a flat-lying structure in the mantle transition zone under the region east of the NSGL. The structural variation in the deep upper mantle appears to coincide with the sudden changes in surface topography, gravity field, and crustal and lithospheric structures as well, indicating that the two domains may have tectonically deformed differently throughout the whole upper mantle during the Phanerozoic cratonic destruction. The mantle transition zone on the eastern side of the NSGL is up to 30 ∼ 40 km thicker than the global average; this thickness and the complex structure of the 660-km discontinuity in this region may reflect the strong influence that the deep subduction and stagnancy of the Pacific slab, and its possible sporadic penetration into the lower mantle, have had on mantle dynamics and lithospheric reactivation in the eastern NCC since the Mesozoic time. On the other hand, the less variable structure and normal-to-thin mantle transition zone imaged beneath the central and western NCC may indicate that the IndiaEurasia collision has had a relatively weak effect on the Cenozoic tectonics of these regions.

70350092333	Improving opportunistic data dissemination via known vector	An opportunistic network is a network where each node only has connectiviy with other nodes opportunistically. To disseminate data in this kind of network is a challenging task and had drawn lots of research effort. When two nodes have connectivity with each other, the data bundles stored in their memory will be either replicated or forwarded to the other node in the hope that the data eventually reaches the destination node. The protocols that has only one copy of each data bundle is catagorized as forwarding protocol while the ones with multiple copies called replicating protocols. In opportunistic network, the replicating protocols are preferred over forwarding protocols. Yet, a big overhead is to be solved for replicating routing protocols, i.e. the exchanging of metadata. To avoid sending data bundles the other party already has, replicating protocols usually exchange metadata at the beginning of the connecting period. The naive method, sending the data bundles index summary in the memory, seems reasonable. But over time, this metadata exchange will become a big overhead. This paper propose a new scheme of indexing data bundles in the memory and can also reduces the metadata exchanged by large extent. © 2009 IEEE.

76349109048	An analytical study of GWAP-based geospatial tagging systems	Geospatial tagging (geotagging) is an emerging and very promising application that can help users find a wide variety of location-specific information, and facilitate the development of future location-based services. Conventional geotagging systems share some limitations, such as the use of a two-phase operating model and the tendency to tag popular objects with simple contexts. To address these problems, geotagging systems based on the concept of 'Games with a Purpose' (GWAP) have been developed recently. In this study, we use analysis to investigate these new systems. Based on our analysis results, we design three metrics to evaluate the system performance, and develop five task assignment algorithms for a GWAP-based system. Using a comprehensive set of simulations under both synthetic and realistic mobility scenarios, we find that the Least-Throughput-First Assignment algorithm (LTFA)is the most effective approach because it can achieve competitive system utility, while its computational complexity remains moderate. We also find that, to improve the system utility, it is better to assign as many tasks as possible in each round. However, because players may feel annoyed if too many tasks are assigned at the same time, it is recommended that multiple tasks be assigned one by one in each round in order to achieve higher system utility.

77249108874	An analytical study of people mobility in opportunistic networks	An opportunistic network is a type of Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) in which communication opportunities are intermittent. Moreover, an end-to-end path between the source and the destination may never have existed, disconnection and reconnection are common occurrences, and link performance is highly variable or extreme. With numerous emerging opportunistic networking applications, strategies that can facilitate effective data communication in such challenging environments have become increasingly desirable. In particular, knowing the fundamental properties of opportunistic networks will soon be the key to the proper design of opportunistic routing schemes and applications. In this study, we investigate opportunistic network scenarios based on two public network traces, namely, the UCSD and Dartmouth traces. Our contribution is twofold. First, we identify the censorship issue in network traces that usually leads to a strongly skewed distribution of the measurements. Based on this knowledge, we then apply the Kaplan-Meier Estimator to calculate the survivorship of network measurements. The survivorship feature is used to design our proposed censorship removal algorithm (CRA) for recovering censored data. Second, we perform an in-depth analysis of the UCSD and Dartmouth network traces. We show that they exhibit strong self-similarity, and can be modeled as such. We believe these newly revealed characteristics will be important in the future development and evaluation of opportunistic networks.

77951254803	An evaluation study of mobility support in ZigBee networks	Based on the IEEE 802.15.4 LR-WPAN specification, the ZigBee standard has been proposed to interconnect simple, low rate, and battery powered wireless devices. The deployment of ZigBee networks is expected to facilitate numerous applications, such as home healthcare, medical monitoring, consumer electronics, and environmental sensors. For many of the envisioned applications, device mobility is unavoidable and must be accommodated. Thus, providing ubiquitous connections to/from a mobile device is crucial for various future ZigBee applications. Knowledge of how nodal mobility affects the ZigBee routing protocol is important, but the lack of ZigBee simulator support has limited the amount of research, evaluation, and development in this area. Thus far, researchers have been unable to analyze and evaluate the impact of mobile applications via extensive simulations. In this paper, our contribution is threefold. First, we present an initial implementation of the ZigBee network layer in NS-2, which will allow further research and development to be conducted in this area. Second, we analyze the adequacy of current provisions for dealing with different mobility cases. Third, we provide a comprehensive set of simulation results that demonstrate the inefficacy of the current standard for handling mobility. Our results show that the ZigBee device plays a significant role in determining the routing performance in mobile scenarios. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77951276576	Localized data dissemination in vehicular sensing networks	A vehicular sensing network (VSN) is a type of wireless sensor network that empowers legacy resource-constrained WSNs by taking advantage of the rich network resources (e.g., the battery life, storage capability, and mobility) of vehicles. In this paper, we posit that the sensed data in VSNs is generally local in nature and propose a simple yet effective scheme, called To-and-Fro (TAF), for localized data dissemination. Unlike conventional wireless networks and sensing systems, the TAF scheme operates in an opportunistic manner and does not need a network infrastructure. More precisely, the scheme always forwards messages to passing vehicles if they are moving in the opposite direction. Using simulations of both synthetic and realistic network scenarios, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is simple, practical, and effective for localized data dissemination in vehicular sensing networks. Moreover, the scheme is easy to deploy, as long as each vehicle in the network can access CPS information. Copyright © 2009 IEEE.

Yet technologies for both of them are expensive and not scalable. Also it is important to tune the monitoring system parameters for different species to adapt their behavior and gain the best result of monitoring. In this paper, we propose using wireless sensor networks to build both short term and long term wildlife and ecological monitoring systems. For the short term system, everything used is off-the-shelf and can be easily purchased from the market. We suggest that before establishing a large scale wildlife/ecological monitoring network, it is worthwhile to first spend a short period of time constructing a rapid prototype of the targeted network. Through verifying the correctness of the prototype network, ecologists can find potential problems, avoid total system failure, and use the best-tuned parameters for the long-term monitoring network. © 2010 IEEE.

In addition, we implement a quasi ESP game, called ESP Lite, which embeds three puzzle selection algorithms transparently and records the complete game trace for evaluation and further research. During a one-month experiment, we have investigated the inner properties of the three strategies in real-world GWAP systems, and verified that the OPSA scheme achieves the best system utility for the ESP game. The results of this study demonstrate that GWAP systems are more efficient if they are designed and played with strategies. © 2010 IEEE.

78649893448	Exploiting puzzle diversity in puzzle selection for ESP-like GWAP systems	The ESP game belongs to the genre called Games with a Purpose (GWAP), which leverage people's desire to be entertained and also outsource certain steps of the computational process to humans. The productivity of ESP-like GWAP systems depends to a great extent on the puzzle selection strategy used in the system. Although traditional approaches seek to determine the optimal number of agreements reached in each puzzle, they may be affected by the equality of outcomes issue because they ignore the differences among puzzles. In this paper, using realistic game traces, we define the puzzle diversity issue and propose a novel approach, called the Adaptive Puzzle Selection Algorithm (APSA), to promote equality of opportunity in ESP-like GWAP systems. We also introduce a data structure called the Weight Sum Tree (WST) to reduce the computational complexity of the proposed scheme and facilitate its implementation in real-world systems. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we evaluate the APSA scheme against the traditional OPSA scheme, and demonstrate that APSA can better accommodate the differences among puzzles in ESP-like GWAP systems. © 2010 IEEE.

To tailor efficient transmission schemes, it is essential to develop a wireless error model that can provide insight into the behavior of wireless transmissions. In this study, we investigate the wireless error model of Bluetooth networks. We study the FHSS feature of Bluetooth using both ordinary hopping kernels and Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) kernels, and design analytical error models accordingly to capture the channel behavior of Bluetooth networks. We evaluate the proposed models by comparing the analytical results to the simulation results obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

We believe that the review results provided by Amazon's review system may not be representative of the advertised products because the system does not consider two essential factors, namely the credibility and the time-decay of public reviews. Using a dataset downloaded from Amazon.com, we demonstrate that although the credibility and time-decay issues are very common, they are not handled well by current public review systems. To address the situation, we propose a Review-credibility and Time-decay Based Ranking (RTBR) approach, which improves the Amazon review system by exploiting the credibility and time-decay of reviews posted by the public. We evaluate the proposed scheme against the current Amazon scheme. The results demonstrate that the RTBR scheme is superior to the Amazon scheme because it is more credible and it provides timely review results. Moreover, the scheme is simple and applicable to other Amazon-like review systems in which the reviews are time-stamped and can be evaluated by other users.

84861682704	A two-layer approach for energy efficiency in mobile location sensing applications	Mobile location sensing applications (MLSAs) represent an emerging genre of applications that exploit Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and facilitate location-based services. The design of MLSAs must incorporate a tradeoff between information accuracy and energy efficiency because GPS technology and data communications are energy expensive and unaffordable for most MLSA platforms, which are battery-powered and therefore resource-constrained. In this study, we propose a two-layer solution to address the above issue. The solution comprises an Event-based GPS Tracking (EBT) scheme and an Inter-Frame Coding (IFC) scheme for energy efficiency on the MLSA GPS tracking and data communication layers respectively. Using a comprehensive set of evaluations, as well as realistic MLSA traces, we evaluate the proposed solution in terms of power saving, location accuracy, and the data compression ratio.

84862923274	A rapid method for detecting geographically disconnected areas after disasters	In this paper, we present a novel solution called Internet Footprint Investigation (IFI) for the rapid detection of network outages after a natural or man-made disaster. IFI is comprised of two components: 1) the Active Network Probing (ANP) module, which proactively probes the network infrastructure to detect geographic areas that may be disconnected; and 2) the Reactive Footprint Search (RFS) module, a reactive mechanism that improves the accuracy of the ANP results by incorporating the footprints of location-based social networks (LBSNs) established after a disaster occurs. Using Typhoon Morakot, which struck Taiwan in August 2009, as a case study, we implement the IFI system and evaluate its feasibility in a real-world scenario. We observe that the accuracy of existing IP geolocation services is unsatisfactory, and posit that localized IP geolocation services should be deployed and maintained all the times. Moreover, we demonstrate how existing LBSNs can be used to search for disaster victims in areas reported by ANP, and identify so-called "critical areas", which have no Internet activity, for priority inspection. The proposed IFI solution is simple and effective, and it can be deployed worldwide. © 2011 IEEE.

84863069626	A study of comfort measuring system using taxi trajectories	The comfort of rides has been identified as one of the top criteria that affects passengers'satisfaction with public transportation systems. Conventional comfort measurement approaches rely on professional measure tools or interviews from passengers, which are costly, time-consuming, and not yet feasible. The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is a new solution to answer this problem. The idea of IoT is to interconnect state-of-the-art digital products in physical world to provide more powerful applications. Vehicles equipped with GPS devices and wireless access technologies are parts of the IoT elements in traffic networks. We use the GPS data to measure the comfort level of vehicle rides, and provide a detailed comfort statistics as a value added service. Using real data collected from one of the Taipei taxi service providers, we show that over 95% taxi trajectories are viewed as comfortable. In addition, rides without passengers get higher comfort scores than with passengers. We also give the rankings of all taxi drivers according to a number of criteria, such as the comfort score and the number of loads. With the ranking results, we can track back to the trajectories and infer drives'driving behaviors, road conditions, and traffic conditions. We believe that the proposed solution has the potential to provide a representative comfort measurement service for taxi services and additional value-added services for public transportation systems. © 2011 IEEE.

This is not quite true depending on the application at hand. Commissioned to implement YuShanNet, a delay-tolerant sensor network (DTSN) enabling encounter information collection for hiker search and rescue, we find that the naive use of standard GPSs time acquisition functionalities gives a synchronization error at the scale of 10-100s milliseconds, which is not sufficient given two application-specific considerations: (1) data goodput and (2) energy efficiency. The two requirements are crucial in that the matter is life or death and the hiking trips usually take days. Towards efficient use of the intermittent connectivity in YuShanNet, we design, implement, and evaluate a time synchronization mechanism that improves the synchronization accuracy by approximately two orders of magnitude. This enables TDMA-fashioned MAC for high-goodput data transmission while the GPS is duty-cycled for energy efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.

84865580624	An analytical model for generalized ESP games	The ESP game belongs to the genre called Games With A Purpose (GWAP), which leverage people's desire to be entertained and also outsource certain steps of the computational process to humans. The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this study, we consider generalized ESP games with two objectives. First, we propose an analytical model for computing the utility of generalized ESP games, where the number of players, the consensus threshold, and the stopping condition are variable. We show that our model can accurately predict the stopping condition that will yield the optimal utility of a generalized ESP game under a specific game setting. A service provider can therefore utilize the model to ensure that the hosted generalized ESP games produce high-quality labels efficiently. Second, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of ESP-like GWAP systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of generalized ESP games. We believe that GWAP systems should be designed and played with strategies. To this end, we implement an optimal puzzle selection strategy (OPSA) based on our analysis. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed OPSA approach can effectively improve the system gain of generalized ESP games, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84866487891	Cross-layer performance evaluation of sensor networks: Routing over energy efficient MAC	Delivering data in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is very challenging in that an ideal solution has to not only provide a reasonable data throughput, but also take into consideration a variety of constraints, such as battery life, computation capabilities, wireless interference, node mobility, and etc. As numerous solutions have been proposed in the past years, most designs have focused on the functionalities within a particular layer, i.e., routing protocol design in the network layer or MAC enhancements in the data link layer. However, the overall performance depends also on the interaction of mechanisms across layers. A comprehensive cross-layer performance evaluation is essential to a better understanding of the oversal system performance when deploying a new protocol. In this case study, we simulate the interaction between a more recently proposed routing protocol and a number of MAC protocols. The results show that the performance of the routing protocol varies as different MAC schemes are employed. In particular, the state-of-the-art MAC protocol might not perform the best with the routing protocl in study. No single combination dominates the other combinations in terms of all metrics in all cases. © 2008 ACM.

84871956571	Open information gateway for disaster management	How to exchange information between parties in a mega-scale disaster management system is one of the fundamental challenges to support timely and efficient disaster response and relief. Specifically, the timeliness, scalability, and availability are three desirable features for information exchange. We call the framework to support information exchange with the three features an open information gateway, OIGY in short. In this paper, we present the challenges of information gateway, and the design of the communication protocols and the fundamental components and algorithms to support the aforementioned features. The efforts of this work will be divided into two major components: one is the distributed Truthful Real-time Information Publishing and Subscribing (TRIPS), and the other one is Heterogeneous And Plug-n-PlaY networks (HAPPY). The two components in OIGY collaborate to provide reliable and timely information publish and subscription service. TRIPS is responsible for logical information exchange management. Compared to modern real-time publish and subscription services, TRIPS is aimed at information responsiveness and distributed content-based filtering in an un-reliable network. To achieve better responsiveness, TRIPS will take advantage of the run-time service composition of SOA framework to select information sources. To enhance the success rate, TRIPS relies the information routing information provided by HAPPY. HAPPY will integrate heterogeneous communication networks including 3G/WiMAX telecommunication network and mesh mobile network into a coherent communication network and discovers the routes with probabilistic bandwidth guarantee. © 2012 IEEE.

84872783298	HTTP: A new framework for bus travel time prediction based on historical trajectories	In this paper, we develop a new bus travel time prediction framework, called Historical Trajectory based Travel/Arrival Time Prediction (HTTP) for real-time prediction of travel time over future segments (and thus the arrival time at stops) of an on-going bus journey. The basic idea behind HTTP is to use a collection of historical trajectories "similar" to the current bus trajectory to predict the future segments. Specifically, the HTTP framework (1) samples a set of similar trajectories as the basis for travel time estimation instead of relying on only one historical trajectory best matching the on-going bus journey; and (2) explores different prediction schemes, namely, passed segments, temporal features, and hybrid methods, to identify the sample set of similar trajectories. We conduct a comprehensive empirical experimentation using real bus trajectory data collected from Taipei City, Taiwan to validate our ideas and to evaluate the proposed schemes. Experimental result shows that the proposed prediction schemes significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and baseline techniques. © 2012 ACM.

84891369393	Measuring link characteristics of power line communication systems	Knowing link characteristics of a network connection is essential for the efficient design, management, and usage of a network. In view of the proliferation of power line communication systems, in this work, we propose a novel measurement approach, called PLC-Probe, to concurrently measure link capacity and available bandwidth of PLC links. PLC-Probe uses 'train-chirps' to probe the network, and it combines the strengths of the packet train and packet chirp approaches for estimation of link characteristics. Using testbed experiment, we evaluate the proposed approach and show that PLC-Probe is accurate, stable, and robust against cross traffic. Moreover, PLC-Probe is simple, effective, and applicable to other multi-rated PLC-like networks. © 2013 IEEE.

84899419578	A crowdsourcing-based approach to assess concentration levels of students in class videos	Concentration is important for students to conduct efficient learning in a class, and an effective assessment of students' concentration level in a class is useful for students to review class materials after lessons, as well as for lecturers to adjust their teaching strategies for self-improvement. Although a number of concentration assessment approaches have been proposed, conventional approaches are generally time/money expensive (e.g., expert opinions), inaccurate (e.g., computer vision-based approaches), and intrusive (e.g., wearable sensor-based approaches). In this study, we propose a novel approach, called Concentration Level Assessment System (CLAS), which combines a markovian Doze-and-Wake Model (DAWM) and the emerging crowdsourcing technique to enable effective concentration assessment of class videos. Using realistic datasets of class videos, we conduct a comprehensive set of synthetic analysis and Internet experiments, the results demonstrate that CLAS is capable of yielding an accuracy up to 98% with 86% cost savings. Moreover, CLAS is simple, effective, and scalable, and it shows promises in facilitating advanced applications for efficiency, productivity, and safety in the future. © 2013 IEEE.

84907000801	Measurement of long-distance Wi-Fi connections: An empirical study	Long-distance Wi-Fi technology has shown promise in several network applications that cannot utilize conventional technologies effectively. Although the network performance of Wi-Fi technology is affected by a number of environmental factors, there is a dearth of long-term, continuous, and systematic studies on the correlations between those factors and the technology's performance. In this study, we deployed a long-distance Wi-Fi testbed on our campus and conducted a one-year experiment. Comprehensive data analysis of the measurement results shows that rainfall is the major weather attribute that affects the network performance of long-distance Wi-Fi links. In addition, the performance is highly correlated to human activities in the immediate vicinity. The results also demonstrate it is possible to infer people's daily routines on campus by exploiting the long-term measurement data. © 2014 IEEE.

84907013139	An in-depth study of forecasting household electricity demand using realistic datasets	Data analysis and accurate forecasts of electricity demand are crucial to help both suppliers and consumers understand their detailed electricity footprints and improve their awareness about their impacts to the ecosystem. Several studies of the subject have been conducted in recent years, but they are either comprehension-oriented without practical merits; or they are forecast-oriented and do not consider per-consumer cases. To address this gap, in this paper, we conduct data analysis and evaluate the forecasting of household electricity demand using three realistic datasets of geospatial and lifestyle diversity. We investigate the correlations between household electricity demand and different external factors, and perform cluster analysis on the datasets using an exhaustive set of parameter settings. To evaluate the accuracy of electricity demand forecasts in different datasets, we use the support vector regression method. The results demonstrate that the medium mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) can be reduced to 15.6% for household electricity demand forecasts when proper configurations are used. © 2014 ACM.

84908022790	Using known vectors to improve data dissemination in opportunistic networks	An opportunistic network is a type of challenged network in which contacts are intermittent, an end-to-end path rarely exists between the source and the destination, disconnection and reconnection are common occurrences, and link performance is highly variable or extreme. Conventional methods of data dissemination in opportunistic networks rely on a meta-message exchange scheme, called the summary vector (SV), to prevent redundant transmission of data bundles that already exist on receivers. We consider that the SV scheme is costly in terms of the data transmission overhead, which is unaffordable in opportunistic networks. Hence, we propose an alternative scheme, called the known vector (KV), to improve the efficiency of meta-message exchanges for data transmission in opportunistic networks. Using a comprehensive set of simulations with realistic network scenarios, we demonstrate that the KV scheme can be easily integrated into existing opportunistic network routing protocols (e.g., Epidemic and PRoPHET routing). Moreover, it can reduce the communication overhead significantly, thereby improving energy efficiency for data transmission in opportunistic networks.

84908896656	Runtime service recovery for open information gateway	How to effectively exchange information between parties in a disaster management system is one of the fundamental challenges to support timely and efficient disaster response and relief. Specifically, the timeliness, scalability, and availability are three desirable features for information exchange. We call the framework to support information exchange with the three features an Open Information Gateway (OIGY). In this paper, we present and experiment the mechanisms to recover communicaiton service during and after disasters for Open Information Gateway. The designed mechanisms adopt long distance radio to support tele-communication and computer networks, dynamic power adjustment for radio stations to maximize the radio recovery with minimal interference, and dynamic MESH routers to connect devices located in different networks. We experimented the proposed mechanims on a physical communication testbeds to measure the delay for service recovery and reliability of the proposed mechanism.

84919451456	SUDO: A Secure Database Outsourcing solution for location-based systems	Location-based systems (LBS) represent an emerging genre of applications that exploit positioning technologies and facilitate a wide range of location-based services. Unlike conventional information systems, LBS data management is challenging because LBS data is high dimensional and spatio-temporal in nature, and information leakage may result in location related privacy crises. The issue has become even more complicated, as database outsourcing has become inevitable in view of the emerging popularity of LBS deployment. In this paper, we tackle the research challenge and propose a SecUre Database Outsourcing system, called SUDO. By combining the techniques of Hilbert space-filling curves, different invertible encryption algorithms, and genuine mixed data, we show that SUDO is capable of preserving location privacy for LBS against different attacks. Moreover, the proposed solution is simple, effective, and scalable; and it shows promise in supporting LBS data management with outsourced databases. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

84923163927	Exploring sequential probability tree for movement-based community discovery	In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering movement-based communities of users, where users in the same community have similar movement behaviors. Note that the identification of movement-based communities is beneficial to location-based services and trajectory recommendation services. Specifically, we propose a framework to mine movement-based communities which consists of three phases: 1) constructing trajectory profiles of users, 2) deriving similarity between trajectory profiles, and 3) discovering movement-based communities. In the first phase, we design a data structure, called the Sequential Probability tree (SP-tree), as a user trajectory profile. SP-trees not only derive sequential patterns, but also indicate transition probabilities of movements. Moreover, we propose two algorithms: BF (standing for breadth-first) and DF (standing for depth-first) to construct SP-tree structures as user profiles. To measure the similarity values among users' trajectory profiles, we further develop a similarity function that takes SP-tree information into account. In light of the similarity values derived, we formulate an objective function to evaluate the quality of communities. According to the objective function derived, we propose a greedy algorithm Geo-Cluster to effectively derive communities. To evaluate our proposed algorithms, we have conducted comprehensive experiments on two real data sets. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can effectively discover movement-based user communities.
