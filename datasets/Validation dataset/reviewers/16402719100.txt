84926479524	Nonbond interactions between grapheme nanosheets and polymers: A computational study	Based on the geometries from molecular dynamics simulations and a package compiled by us, the interactions between graphene nanosheet (GNS) and nine types of flexible polymers have been investigated with force field. Both the van der Waals (vdW) interaction and the electrostatic interaction (EI) for two same polymer chains and between a polymer and a GNS were calculated and compared. The effect of cut-off distance was explored. It was found that the cut-off distance plays a significant role in EI energy, but a less important role in vdW energy when the cut-off distance is over 9.5 A. The reasonable cut-off distances for EI and vdW interactions for simulation are suggested.

14944358414	Theoretical studies on photoionization cross sections of solid gold	Accurate expression for photoabsorption (photoionization) cross sections of high density system proposed recently is used to study the photoionization of solid gold. The results show that the present theoretical photoionization cross sections have good agreement both in structure and in magnitude with the experimental results of gold crystal. The studies also indicate that both the real part ε′ and the imaginary part ε″ of the complex dielectric constant ε, and the dielectric influence function of a nonideal system have rich structures in low energy side with a range about 50 eV, and suggest that the influence of particle interactions of surrounding particles with the photoionized particle on the photoionization cross sections can be easily investigated using the dielectric influence function. The electron overlap effects are suggested to be implemented in the future studies to improve the accuracy of theoretical photoionization cross sections of a solid system. © International Academic Publishers.

15944390573	New expression for photoionization cross sections and its application in high density system	A new expression for photoionization cross section has been proposed based on the Beer-Lambert' s law and Maxwell equations for a material. And we also proposed a function varying with the number density of the system, which includes the local field effect and the higher-order dielectric correction to the famous formula for photoionization cross section of isolated atoms, proposed by Fano and Cooper in 1968.The photoionization cross sections of solid xenon have been studied by using this alternative expression which couples the macroproperty and the quantum quantity of the photoionization system, and which makes it possible for one to study the influence of induced dipoles on the photoionization. The dielectric behaviors of the matter in condensed state under several physical conditions (given the complex dielectric constants or the model of electric susceptibility of the system) are considered using our new expression for photoionization cross sections. The results show that it is reasonable in physics to calculate the cross sections of atoms in a real system by using the accurate expression. Furthermore, the more correct the model of electric susceptibility for the real system, the more accurate the cross section obtained from our formula will be.

2442683892	Density-dependent expressions for photoionization cross-sections	Alternative expressions for photoionization cross-sections and dielectric influence functions are suggested to study the photoionization cross-sections of atoms in solid system. The basic picture is that the photoionization cross-section of atoms in a real system can be described as the coupling between quantum quantity (QQ) and classical quantity (CQ) parts. The QQ part represents the photoionization cross-sections of an isolated particle, while the CQ part may represent most of the important influence of the macroscopic effects (e.g., the interactions of all surrounding polarized particles, and the dielectric property, etc.) on the photoionization cross-sections. The applications to the barium system show that the number-density-dependent new photoionization formula not only obtains the same cross-sections as those from the first order approximation for ideal gas, but also can generate the cross-sections for solid barium by transforming those of ideal gas of the same species using the dielectric influence function. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In order to solve the scale problem and to improve the dyeability of yak hair, yak hair fiber was treated by microwave low temperature plasma (MLTP) in this study. The weight loss and the dyeing properties of the yak hair fiber modified by MLTP were investigated.

34047259870	Enhancement of stochastic resonance induced by either internal or external noise in NO reduction on platinum surfaces	Using the chemical Langevin equation (CLE), we have studied the effects of the interaction between internal and external noise on the oscillatory kinetics in the mesoscopic stochastic system of NO reduction by CO on single-crystal platinum surfaces. It is found that, when the system is driven by internal and external noise simultaneously, external noise and internal noise can enhance the stochastic resonance induced by internal noise (SRIN) and by external noise (SREN), respectively. Moreover, there exists an optimal external noise strength for the enhancement of SRIN and an optimal system size for the enhancement of the stochastic resonance by external noise (SREN), respectively. This result shows that internal and external noise would benefit the stochastic reaction oscillations induced by each other, and play similar positive roles in enhancing SREN and SRIN, respectively, though they are generated in different mechanisms. In addition, the enhancements of SRIN and SREN are selective to external and internal noise intensity, respectively. It is also shown that the optimal system size for the SRIN and the optimal external noise intensity for the SREN can be regulated by external noise and internal noise, respectively. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

36448952372	Novel effect of coupled external and internal noise in stochastic resonance	In this paper, on the basis of mesoscopic stochastic model of NO reduction by CO on single-crystal platinum surfaces, we report a novel effect of the external noise of reaction rate constant coupled to internal noise in stochastic resonance induced by external noise (SREN) or internal noise (SRIN). It is shown that the internal noise can enhance the SREN, and the external noise intensity for the SREN increases with increasing internal noise. However, the external noise can suppress the SRIN, and the suppressions nonmonotonously vary with the increasing external noise intensity. This result is different from the effect of the external noise of NO partial pressure coupled to the internal noise in the SR behavior of the system, which shows that the various external noise sources have different effects in the SRIN. And different roles of positive or negative feedback of the external noise terms may be a probable mechanism for the difference. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

39949084322	Macroscopic local-field effects on photoabsorption processes	The influence of the local-field effect on the photoabsorption cross sections of the atoms which are embedded in the macroscopic medium has been studied by a set of alternative expressions in detail. Some notes on the validity of some different local-field models used to study the photoabsorption cross sections of atoms in condensed matter have been given for the first time. Our results indicate that the local fields can have substantial and different influence on the photoabsorption cross section of atoms in condensed matter for different models. Clausius-Mossotti model and Onsager model have proved to be more reasonable to describe the local field in gas, liquid, or even some simple solid, while Glauber-Lewenstein model probably is wrong in these conditions except for the ideal gas. A procedure which can avoid the errors introduced by Kramers-Kronig transformation has been implemented in this work. This procedure can guarantee that the theoretical studies on the local field effects will not be influenced by the integral instability of the Kramers-Kronig transformation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

41549121948	Enhancement of stochastic oscillations by colored noise or internal noise in NO reduction by CO on small platinum surfaces	In this paper, based on the stochastic model of NO reduction by CO on Pt crystal surfaces and taking Gaussian colored noise as external fluctuations of the NO partial pressure, we study the effect of the colored noise on the internal noise-induced stochastic oscillations (INSOs) and the effect of internal noise on the colored noise-induced stochastic oscillations (CNSOs). It is found that the INSO can be enhanced by the colored noise with appropriate correlation time or noise strength and, interestingly, the CNSO can be enhanced by the internal noise as well and, moreover, the enhanced CNSO can reach the best oscillatory states repetitively via proper internal noises. This effect of the internal noise is different from its effect on the stochastic oscillations induced by the external Gaussian white noise, which probably results from the interaction of the correlated colored noise and the internal noise. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

58149526352	Effect of gating currents of ion channels on the collective spiking activity of coupled Hodgkin-Huxley neurons	Based on the coupled stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons, we numerically studied the effect of gating currents of ion channels, as well as coupling and the number of neurons, on the collective spiking rate and regularity in the coupled system. It was found, for a given coupling strength and with a relatively large number of neurons, when gating currents are applied, the collective spiking regularity decreases; meanwhile, the collective spiking rate increases, indicating that gating currents can aggravate the desynchronization of the spikings of all neurons. However, gating currents caused hardly any effect in the spiking of any individual neuron of the coupled system. This result, different from the reduction of the spiking rate by gating currents in a single neuron, provides a new insight into the effect of gating currents on the global information processing and signal transduction in real neural systems. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

43349092441	Effect of channel block on the collective spiking activity of coupled stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neurons	Toxins, such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) and tetrodotoxin (TTX), can make potassium or sodium ion channels poisoned, respectively, and hence reduce the number of working ion channels and lead to the diminishment of conductance. In this paper, we have studied by numerical simulations the effects of sodium and potassium ion channel poisoning on the collective spiking activity of an array of coupled stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons. It is found for a given number of neurons sodium or potassium ion channel block can either enhance or reduce the collective spiking regularity, depending on the membrane patch size. For a given smaller or larger patch size, potassium and sodium ion channel block can reduce or enhance the collective spiking regularity, but they have different patch size ranges for the transformation. This result shows that sodium or potassium ion channel block might have different effects on the collective spiking activity in coupled HH neurons from the effects for a single neuron, which represents the interplay among the diminishment of maximal conductance and the increase of channel noise strength due to the channel blocks, as well as the bi-directional coupling between the neurons. © 2008 Science Press.

It is found the optimal RRO can be enhanced by appropriate EN and, moreover, there is an optimal EN by which the optimal RRO can be most highly enhanced. This result shows EN may play a constructive role in the intrinsic stochastic reaction oscillations via the interplay with internal noise, and the oscillations can selectively employ the EN to reach a best oscillatory performance. Therefore, EN should be paid high attention in the study of the kinetics in CO oxidation on nm-sized Pd particles. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Fourier transformed spectra of He H+ molecule ion have allowed direct comparison between peaks in the spectra and the scaled action values of closed orbits of the excited electron in the external fields. We find that the spectral modulations can be analyzed in terms of the scattering of the excited electron on the molecular core. Unlike the case of the Rydberg atom where the elastic scattering is predominant, modulations produced by inelastic scattering are also vital to the photoabsorption spectrum of Rydberg molecule. Our results are in good agreement with the quantum results, which suggest that our method is correct. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

67849086553	Non-Gaussian noise optimized spiking activity of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons on random complex networks	In this paper, we numerically study how the NGN's deviation q from Gaussian noise (q = 1) affects the spike coherence and synchronization of 60 coupled Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons driven by a periodic sinusoidal stimulus on random complex networks. It is found that the effect of the deviation depends on the network randomness p (the fraction of random shortcuts): for larger p (p > 0.15), the spiking regularity keeps being improved with increasing q; while, for smaller p (p < 0.15), the spiking regularity can reach the best performance at an optimal intermediate q value, indicating the occurrence of "deviation-optimized spike coherence". The synchronization becomes enhanced with decreasing q, and the enhancing extent for a random HH neuron network is stronger than for a regular one. These behaviors show that the spike coherence and synchronization of the present HH neurons on random networks can be more strongly enhanced by various other types of external noise than by Gaussian noise, whereby the neuron firings may behave more periodically in time and more synchronously in space. Our results provide the constructive roles of the NGN on the spiking activity of the present system of HH neuron networks. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

70350317797	Influence of integral instability of Kramers-kronig transformation on photoabsorption cross sections	The photoabsorption cross sections of condensed atoms and molecules have proven to be dependent not only on the imaginary parts but also on the real parts of the polarizabilities due to the strong interatomic interactions in condensed environment. The real parts of the polarizabilities calculated usually by using the famous Kramers-Kronig transformation (KKT) from the photoabsorption cross sections of the isolated atoms are very sensitive to the accuracy of the implementation method of the infinite integral in the KKT. The influence of the integral instability of the KKT and the real part of the polarizability on the variation of the photoabsorption cross sections with the number density and the structure of the condensed matter has been studied in the present work for the first time. The conclusion is that the integration method with interpolation has given more reasonable results than the direct truncation method if some appropriate interpolation functions have been used.

In addition, the thermal property and the microstructure of CPCM were also discussed in detail by means of polarization microscope and differential scanning calorimeter, respectively. According to the analysis of main influencial factors of the property of CPCM, the optimal preparing technique was determined. It was proved that CPCM could exhibit a good thermal property while phase transformation process took place, and a better appearance of the fabric modified with CPCM could be obtained due to the fact that in a warm circumstance, the liquid-state phase change material could be firmly enwrapped and embedded in the three-dimensional network all the time during the phase transformation. Besides, the fabric treated with CPCM had a high phase-transition enthalpy and an appropriate phasetransition temperature. As a result, a desirable temperature-adjustable function appeared.

72749087474	Synchronization transitions on complex thermo-sensitive neuron networks with time delays	We have numerically studied the firing synchronization transitions on random thermo-sensitive neuron networks in dependence on information transmission delay τ, network randomness p, and coupling strength g. It is found that as τ is increased the neurons can exhibit transitions from burst synchronization (BS) to clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS), and further to spike synchronization (SS). It is also found that, with increasing p or g, there are transitions from spatiotemporal chaos to BS, then to APS, and finally to SS. However, the APS state with p or g exists only for intermediate τ values within a narrow range. For τ values outside this range, the APS state does not appear and the firings change directly from spatiotemporal chaos to BS or SS. These results show that, as time delay can do, network topology and coupling strength can also cause complex synchronization transitions in the neurons. In particular, the novel phenomenon of APS state with p or g shows that, with the help of appropriate random connections or coupling strength, the neurons may exhibit the APS behavior at a certain time delay for which the APS does not appear originally. These findings imply that time delay, network randomness, and coupling strength may have subtle effects on the firing behaviors on neuronal networks, and thus could play important roles in the information processing in neural systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Large basis sets and bond functions, as well as the basis set superposition errors, are employed to obtain accurate PECs. The analytical potential energy functions (APEFs) are fitted using the PECs. The vibrational energy levels and the spectroscopic parameters for the complexes are determined using our APEFs and compared to the theoretical works available at present. We also find that the PECs are bound with similar van der Waals interactions, which implies that He, Ne, and Ar may be used for buffer-gas cooling; and Cu, Ag, and Au may be trapped with a similar method because Cu and Ag have been experimentally trapped with He buffer-gas cooling. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

77955207276	Non-Gaussian noise-induced firing transitions and ordered bursting in a thermo-sensitive neuron	In this letter, we investigate how a particular kind of non-Gaussian colored noise (NGN), especially the correlation time τ and the departure q from Gaussian noise, affects the chaotic firing behavior in a thermo-sensitive neuron. It is found that transitions between spiking and bursting occur with changing τ or q, and ordered bursting appears when τ is optimal. As τ is increased, the neuron alternately exhibits spiking and bursting when q < 1, but always bursts when q > 1, and chaotic bursts may become ordered at an optimal τ. As q is increased, the neuron also exhibits transitions between spiking and bursting. These findings provide a new mechanism for the firing transitions in the neuron and present the constructive role of the NGN in the firing activity in the neuron. This reveals that the NGN would play subtle roles in the communication and information processing in the neurons. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

77957980223	Delay-induced coherence bi-resonance-like behavior in stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks	In this paper, we study how information transmission delays affect the spiking behavior of electrically coupled stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons on Newman-Watts networks. It is found that the spiking behavior becomes the most regular at an optimal time delay, indicating the occurrence of delay-induced coherence resonance-like (CR-like) behavior. Interestingly, there are different CR-like types, depending on the membrane patch size of the neuron. For a smaller patch size, only single CR-like behavior occurs; while for a larger patch size, coherence bi-resonance-like (CBR) behavior appears. These findings show that the delay-induced CR-like behavior is closely related to the channel noise strength, and the coupled neurons may exhibit different spiking behaviors under the interplay of the channel noise and time delay. Therefore, the channel noise should be taken into account in the study of time delay-related spiking activity in stochastic HH neurons. This work provides new insight into the role of channel noise and information transmission delays in realistic neural systems. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

78650310065	Transition and enhancement of synchronization by time delays in stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks	In this paper, we study the effect of time delay on spiking synchronizations in Newman-Watts networks of stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons. It is found that as ∞ is increased, the neurons exhibit transitions from spiking synchronization (SS) to clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS) and back to SS. Furthermore, the SS after the APS is enhanced with increasing time delay. For different patch sizes (channel noise strength), network randomness (fraction of random connections), and coupling strengths, the neurons exhibit similar synchronization transitions and the APS always occurs at around ∞=4, representing that the time delay-induced APS behavior is robust to the channel noise, the number of random connections, and the coupling strength. A simple explanation for this phenomenon was given in terms of the relation of spiking time-period and time delay values.Since the information processing in the neurons are fulfilled by the spiking activity of the membrane potential and the spiking synchronization plays a crucial role in the spiking activity, our results may help us understand the effect of time delay as well as the interplay of channel noise and time delay on the spiking activity and hence the information processing in stochastic neuronal systems. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is found that chaotic bursting can be tamed by the coupling and evolves to regular spiking or bursting behavior as the coupling increases. As the NGN's deviation from Gaussian noise changes, the neurons exhibit firing transitions from irregular spiking to regular bursting, and the number of spikes inside per burst varies with the change of the deviation.

79955002985	Single or multiple synchronization transitions in scale-free neuronal networks with electrical or chemical coupling	In this paper, we have studied time delay- and coupling strength-induced synchronization transitions in scale-free modified Hodgkin-Huxley (MHH) neuron networks with gap-junctions and chemical synaptic coupling. It is shown that the synchronization transitions are much different for these two coupling types. For gap-junctions, the neurons exhibit a single synchronization transition with time delay and coupling strength, while for chemical synapses, there are multiple synchronization transitions with time delay, and the synchronization transition with coupling strength is dependent on the time delay lengths. For short delays we observe a single synchronization transition, whereas for long delays the neurons exhibit multiple synchronization transitions as the coupling strength is varied. These results show that gap junctions and chemical synapses have different impacts on the pattern formation and synchronization transitions of the scale-free MHH neuronal networks, and chemical synapses, compared to gap junctions, may play a dominant and more active function in the firing activity of the networks. These findings would be helpful for further understanding the roles of gap junctions and chemical synapses in the firing dynamics of neuronal networks. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Q-switching, Q-switching mode-locking (QML), continuous wave mode-locking (CML), harmonic mode-locking (HML), double-pulse and multiple-pulse operation states can be manipulated by only adjusting the polarization controller with the same pump power. The output spectral bandwidth and pulse width of operation states are measured. The central wavelength dynamics of different operation states achieved by adjusting the polarization controller are also observed and analyzed.

80052131491	Crystallization of alkane melts induced by carbon nanotubes and graphene nanosheets: A molecular dynamics simulation study	The crystallization of alkane melts on carbon nanotubes (CNT) and the surface of graphene nanosheets (GNS) is investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The crystallization process of the alkane melts is analyzed in terms of the bond-orientational order parameter, atomic radial distribution for the CNT/alkane, atomic longitudinal distribution for the GNS/alkane, and diffusion properties. The dimensional effects of the different carbon-based nanostructures on the crystallization of alkane melts are shown. It is found that one-dimensional CNT has a stronger ability to induce the crystallization of the polymer than that of two-dimensional GNS, which provides a support at molecular level for the experimental observation [Li et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2006, 128, 1692 and Xu et al., Macromolecules, 2010, 43, 5000]. From the MD simulations, we also find that the crystallization of alkane molecules has been completed with the highly cooperative processes of adsorption and orientation.

80054856976	Influence of time delay and channel blocking on multiple coherence resonance in Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks	Toxins such as tetraethylammonium (TEA) and tetrodotoxin (TTX) may reduce the number of working potassium and sodium ion channels by poisoning and making them blocked, respectively. In this paper, we study how channel blocking (CB) affects the time delay-induced multiple coherence resonance (MCR), i.e., a phenomenon that the spiking of neuronal networks intermittently reaches the most ordered state, in stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks. It is found that potassium and sodium CB have distinct effects. For potassium CB, the MCR occurs more frequently as the CB develops, but for sodium CB the MCR is badly impaired and only the first coherence resonance (CR) holds and, consequently, the MCR evolves into a single CR as sodium CB develops. We found for sodium CB the spiking becomes disordered at larger delay lengths, which may be the reason for the destruction of the MCR. The underlying mechanism is briefly discussed in terms of distinct effects of potassium and sodium CB on the spiking activity. These results show that potassium CB can increase the frequency of MCR with time delay, but sodium CB may suppress and even destroy the delay-induced MCR. These findings may help to understand the joint effects of CB and time delay on the spiking coherence of neuronal networks. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The main idea is to use single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to suck in lithium nanoparticles. The MD simulations show that SWCNTs can repeatedly absorb and release lithium nanoparticles at certain temperatures, thus making this a practical method for storing lithium. Using force-field MD simulations, the effect of the temperature, initial position of the nanoparticles, simulation time, and diameters of SWCNTs on the absorption and release processes were investigated. © 2011.

84856226667	Coherence resonance and bi-resonance by time-periodic coupling strength in Hodgkin-Huxley neuron networks	We study the effect of time-periodic coupling strength on the spiking coherence of Newman-Watts networks of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neurons with non-Gaussian noise. It is found that the spiking can exhibit coherence resonance (CR) when the extent of deviation of non-Gaussian noise from Gaussian noise and the amplitude of the coupling strength are varied. In particular, coherence bi-resonance (CBR) is observed when the frequency of the coupling strength is varied, and the CBR is always observed when the frequency is equal to, or a multiple of, the spiking period, manifesting as the locking between the frequencies of the spiking and the coupling strength. The results show that a time-periodic coupling strength may play a more constructive and efficient role in enhancing the spiking coherence of the neuronal networks than a constant coupling strength. These findings provide insight into the role of time-periodic coupling strength for enhancing the time precision of information processing in neuronal networks. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Molecular dynamics simulations of nylon 6 melts and its composite with pristine CNT or functionalized CNT embedded have been performed. The properties of the nanocomposites are investigated with the IBE between CNT and nylon 6. The non-bond energies from both vdW and electrostatic interactions, are calculated for nylon 6 and CNT functionalized by different groups. Our calculational results show that the vdW interaction energies of all the functionalized CNT/nylon 6 composites are close to that of the pristine CNT/nylon 6 composite, implicating the electrostatic interactions are responsible for the strong IBE of the functionalized CNT/nylon 6 composites. Therefore, the functionalized CNT can expand the application of polymer in actual production. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84859594523	Chemical structural effects on γ-ray spectra of positron annihilation in fluorobenzenes	Spectra of γ-ray Doppler shifts for positron annihilation in benzene and its fluoro-derivatives are simulated using low energy plane wave positron (LEPWP) approximation. The results are compared with available measurements. It is found that the Doppler shifts in these larger aromatic compounds are dominated by the contributions of the valence electrons and that the LEPWP model overestimates the measurements by approximately 30%, in agreement with previous findings in noble gases and small molecules. It is further revealed that the halogen atoms not only switch the sign of the charges on carbon atoms that they bond to, but that they also polarize other C-H bonds in the molecule leading to a redistribution of the molecular electrostatic potentials. As a result, it is likely that the halogen atoms contribute more significantly to the annihilation process. The present study also suggests that, while the Doppler shifts are sensitive to the number of valence electrons in the molecules, they are less sensitive to the chemical structures of isomers that have the same numbers and type of atoms and, hence, the same numbers of electrons. Further investigation of this effect is warranted. © EDP Sciences, Società Italiana di Fisica, Springer-Verlag 2012.

84861694165	The translocation of DNA oligonucleotide with the water stream in carbon nanotubes	The translocation of biomolecule within carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has attracted great interest and has opened up exciting opportunities for drug delivery, gene detection and sequencing technology. To understand the fundamental interaction and the properties of translocation is indispensable but remains a challenge for both theoretical and experimental investigations. The present work focuses on the dynamics process of a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) oligonucleotide through CNTs with a water-driven field using the steered molecular dynamics simulation. The van der Waals interaction and translocation time . τ is used for analyzing the translocation process. The propulsion and obstruction forces for the movement of ssDNA are described. It is observed that both the strength of the water-driven field and the CNT channel size exert significant influence on the translocation process of ssDNA. Interestingly, both forces, the repulsive force from the water molecules behind ssDNA and the attractive interaction from water molecules in front of ssDNA, drive the ssDNA to move. The relationship between the translocation time and the water velocity is also examined. The present results can provide some helpful ideas for controlling biomolecule translocation process in CNT. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using force-field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we investigate the effect of the types of carbon nanotubes on the filling processes, and the shape of the composite nanowires is affected by diameters of SWCNTs. The MD simulations show that the present composite nanowire is still stable at 1000 K of temperature. The electrical conductivity of the present nanowire is confirmed by the density of state and band structure from the first principles density functional theory.

The result shows that the state of the three-mode cavity field is in an entangled coherent state when the mirror returns to its original state, and the preparations of different entangled coherent states can be controlled. Nine different three-mode entangled coherent states are given, and the different phase factors of these states indicate the different reactions between the field and the movable mirror, which provides an important theoretical basis for the experimental preparations of controllable entangled coherent states. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84863132132	Isothermal crystallization of short polymer chains induced by the oriented slab and the stretched bundle of polymer: A molecular dynamics simulation	Information on the interfacial interaction is vital in understanding the crystallization of short polymer chains around oriented nuclei. However, this interaction is difficult to observe at the atomic level. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the structural formation of polymer chains induced by the highly oriented slab or the stretched bundle of polymer chains. The results show that the surface-induced crystallization of polymer chains is greatly influenced by the foreign surface on the crystal structure and the morphology of the polymers, hence providing molecular-level support for previous experimental observations [Lotz et al. Macromolecules1993, 26, 5915 and Yan et al. Macromolecules2009, 42, 9321]. The order parameter S and the configurations show that the ability of the polypropylene (PP) slab to induce the polyethylene (PE) melt crystallization is weaker than that of the PE slab and that the short PE chains display multiple orientations on the PP slab. In addition, the crystallization rate was found to be dependent on the lattice matching between the free chains and the substrates on the contact lattice planes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Using a molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate the dynamic process by which human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication inhibitor peptides (HRIPs) are encapsulated in a water solution contained inside a CNT. The van der Waals attraction between the HRIPs and the CNT and the root-mean-square deviation are used to analyse the evolution of the encapsulation. It is found that the interaction between the HRIPs and the CNT is the main driving force for the encapsulation process, which does not cause an obvious conformational change to the HRIPs. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

Each a-Si layer, i.e., P/I/N, was deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The conversion efficiency of PV module was affected by variation of deposition temperature. This also caused the variation of optical band gap of I layer. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to detect hydrogen content and bonding mode in I layer in order to find out the basic reason of optical band gap variation. Laser scribe process was employed to form connection in series of a-Si solar cells. The appearance of scribe line was characterized by optical microscope, and the experimental result showed that the most suitable power was about 7.5 μJ.

It is found that the universal scaling law with α=1 holds well for highly charged polystyrene spheres suspended at an air-water interface, where the strong electrostatic interactions play a dominant role. For monolayer suspensions of hard-sphere-like particles, where hydrodynamic interactions become important, deviations from the universal scaling law are observed. The experiment indicates that the hydrodynamic corrections could be incorporated into the universal scaling law of diffusion with an exponent α<1. © 2013 American Physical Society.

Understanding the fundamental interaction and change in biomolecules during encapsulation is indispensable but remains a challenge for both theoretical and experimental investigations. This paper focuses on the interaction between HIV replication inhibitor peptide (HRIP) and CNTs in a neutral solution with molecular dynamics simulation. We observed that HRIP spontaneously inserts into the CNTs and oscillates around the center of the tube, where the non-covalent interaction is minimum. The effects of the diameters of the CNTs on HRIP were investigated. The optimal diameter of the CNT that can provide the most effective encapsulation and causes minimum conformational change in HRIP was found.

84878517450	Gamma-ray spectra of hexane (C	Theoretical gamma-ray spectra of molecule hexane have been calculated and compared with the experimental results in both gas (Iwata et al., 1997a) and liquid (Kerr et al., 1965) phases. The present study reveals that in gas phase not all valence electrons of hexane contribute the same degree in the electron-positron annihilation of hexane. The electrons which dominate the positron-electron annihilation of molecules are called positrophilic electrons. The positrophilic electrons are predominately found to involve the electrons on the lowest occupied valence orbital (LOVO) of a free molecule in gas phase. When hexane is confined in liquid phase, however, the intermolecular interactions ultimately eliminate the free molecular orientation and selectivity for the positrophilic electrons in the gas phase. As a result, the gamma-ray spectra of hexane become an "averaged" contribution from all valence electrons, which is again in agreement with liquid phase measurement. The roles of valence electrons in annihilation process for gas and liquid phases of hexane have been recognized for the first time in the present study. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
