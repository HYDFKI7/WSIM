15044348569	Investigation in 3D-CTM software for simulating precision forging process of aero-engine blade	3D-CTM(Coupled Thermo-Mechanical Forming Simulation) software for precision forging process of aero-engine blade was developed. The key technologies of 3D coupled rigid-viscoplastic thermo-mechanical FEM simulation of blade forging process were studied systematically. By using the remeshing method of contracting from the boundary to the inner, new mesh system from old distorted mesh system can be obtained. A method of modifying the position of nodes touching on the die according to its original normal was proposed to avoid dead lock problem due to uncontinuity of normal of scatted die meshes. The pseudo-static iterative algorithm was used to simplify the coupled thermo-mechanical computation. In particular, formulations to determine relaxation factor Î² was established for rigid viscoplastic FEM adopting penalty function method, and an improved cubic factor rapid algorithm derived from these formulations was proposed by combining with the advantage of advance and retreat search method. Finally, by applying the 3D-CTM to the precision forging process of the blade with tenon, the results show that the system is reliable.

27844521957	Advances in the study and application of meshless methods in metal forming	Meshless methods are a new type of numerical analysis method developed recently. Different from FEM, only nodal data are needed during the construction of field functions in meshless methods, thus getting rid of meshing and eliminating mesh distortion unavoidable in FEM. Based on their merits, meshless methods can handle metal forming processes very effectively especially large plastic deformations. After introducing the basic principles of meshless methods, this paper summarizes the advances in the study and application of meshless methods in metal forming both home and abroad. The key techniques involved are discussed, including selection of weight function, imposition of essential boundary conditions, techniques of discretization and integration, meshless contact searching algorithms and selection of frictional models in metal forming. For wider engineering application of meshless methods in metal forming, some future research areas are pointed out, i. e. coupling of meshless methods and FEM, die shape design optimization using meshless methods, prediction of cracks and defects during metal forming processes and application of meshless methods for solving 3D plastic forming problems.

33846834051	Noise separation based on blind deconvolution in frequency domain	Because of effect of many factors such as reverberation, it is appropriate in general to formulate machine noise spreading process as a convolution model. To separate the convoluted mixed signals, a multi-frequency points blind deconvolution approach is presented, which uses limited frequency points to directly recover time domain noise signals from its frequency domain model. Being different from traditional frequency domain blind deconvolution algorithms, using this new approach firstly runs an instantaneous mixture blind source separation (BSS) step on each frequency point to get a rough estimation of sources, and then refines the sources by running principal component analysis (PCA) and running BSS step again. Because the new approach only operates on a few frequency points, it is efficient in computation and has no permutation indeterminacy problem which is great trouble for taditional frequency domain blind deconvolution algorithms. It has extensive application prospect including machine noise separation. Analysis and simulation demonstrate its good performance in mixed noise separation.

34047157735	Research on grinding staggered teeth on ball-end rotary burr	Staggered teeth type rotary burr is a new cutter with a special rotary surface. Since branch cutting edges are interlaced with main cutting edges on the sphere of the rotary burr and only main cutting edges pass by the zenith of the ball, it greatly widens the chip flutes and improves machining properties of cutter teeth nearby the zenith. The machining properties of staggered teeth type rotary burr are better than general ball-end rotary burr's. Although it is widely used, the research of rotary burr with staggered teeth is not great. In this paper, firstly the helical cutting edge equations on sphere are built. Then, based on the geometry model of helical cutting edge, a helical stagger teeth design is presented and theory of grinding helical grooves of staggered teeth is studied in detail. The smooth spiral rake surface and flank surface can be formed during one-pass grinding process by this method.

34547222399	A novel blind deconvolution algorithm using single frequency bin	Former frequency-domain blind devolution algorithms need to consider a large number of frequency bins and recover the sources in different orders and with different amplitudes in each frequency bin, so they suffer from permutation and amplitude indeterminacy troubles. Based on sliding discrete Fourier transform, the presented deconvolution algorithm can directly recover time-domain sources from frequency-domain convolutive model using single frequency bin. It only needs to execute blind separation of instantaneous mixture once there are no permutation and amplitude indeterminacy troubles. Compared with former algorithms, the algorithm greatly reduces the computation cost as only one frequency bin is considered. Its good and robust performance is demonstrated by simulations when the signal-to-noise-ratio is high. Â© 2007 Springer-Verlag.

34547994622	Finite element optimization of veering factor in fine-blanking process	The vee-ring is one of the most characteristic features of the fine-blanking process which is derived from the conventional blanking. With the vee-ring, a counter plate and some other working parameters, a component with a precise geometry and smoothly blanked surface can be produced without any major secondary operations. However, these working parameters are always empirically determined or determined by trial- and-error method, which is time-consuming and expensive. In this study, a numerical simulation method was used to analyze the effect of vee-ring factors on product quality, such as distance between vee-ring and punch, vee-ring height and blank holder force, so as to obtain as high clean cut ratio as possible. During the simulation, the model was assumed as axisymmetric one and the workpiece was considered as rigid plastic material, meanwhile the tools were defined as rigid bodies so as to shorten the computational time. A damage model taking into account the influence of hydrostatic stress was used to simulate material fracture in fine-blanking. The result obtained from the simulation indicated that with the help of vee-ring, the metal material near the shear band does not flow with the punch penetration and high compressive stress in the shear band is generated. Consequently, higher clean cut ratio can be obtained with a vee-ring model than the one obtained with a plane blank holder model. Furthermore, the longer the distance between vee-ring and punch is, the higher the height of roll-over becomes.

39049132764	Adaptive parametric interpolation scheme with limited acceleration and jerk values for NC machining	Parametric interpolation has many advantages over the traditional linear or circular interpolation in computer numerical control (CNC) machining. The existing work in this regard is reported to have achieved constant feedrate, confined chord error and limited acceleration/deceleration in one interpolator. However, the excessive jerk still exists due to abrupt change in acceleration profile, which will cause shock to the machine as well as deteriorate the surface accuracy. In this paper, an adaptive interpolation scheme incorporating machine's dynamics capability consideration is proposed and illustrated in details. In the proposed algorithm, the commanded feedrate is maintained at most of the time and adaptively reduced in large curvature areas to meet the demand of the machining accuracy requirement, while at the same time, the acceleration and jerk values are limited within the machine's capabilities during the whole interpolation process. It ensures a high machining accuracy, eliminates the phenomenon of overshoot/undershoot and reduces mechanical shock to the machine tools. The real-time performance of this interpolator is also measured to demonstrate its practical application. Two non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curve interpolation experiments are provided to verify the feasibility and advantages of the proposed scheme. Â© 2006 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

In this paper, EACS is proposed which takes IC engine as a main power unit and the electric motor as an assistant one. Because the fuel consumption of HEV mainly depends on IC engine, EACS restricts the IC engine to operate under the condition with favorable fuel economy. In the paper several control parameters are described such as the maximum torque, the lowest and highest desired battery state of charge (SOC), whose values will affect the performance of HEV remarkably. In addition, the test models of power units for HEV, mathematical models of transmission and vehicle dynamics for HEV are established. A forward-facing simulation software (i.e. driver-to-wheel) based on MATLAB/Simulink is developed to test the performance of EACS and determine the proper value of the control parameters. The simulation results and conclusion are also shown in the paper.

51849142606	Machine degradation analysis using fuzzy CMAC neural network approach	Traditionally, machine condition is described as a dichotomous problem: normal or failure. In fact, machines go through a series of degrading states until failure occurs. Degrading states do not make machines breakdown, but they do decrease performance reliability and increase the potential for faults and failures. In this paper, a neural network approach based on fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller (FCMAC) is proposed to analyze machine degradation severity. Two kinds of situations are discussed: (1) machine signature from different levels of degradation severity are available to train the network; (2) machine signature from only normal perfect state are available to train the network. A degradation index is developed to reflect the degradation degree. The FCMAC network works as a 'classifier' or a 'condition discriminator' in these two situations. An example is presented to demonstrate this method and the results show that the FCMAC network is capable of ranking machine degradations quantitatively in both situations. With degradation analysis, maintenance activities can be implemented before failure eventually occurs, thus preventing fatal breakdowns more effectively. Â© 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

54549104860	New constitutive model characterized by strain softening	Based on the creep equation, a new constitutive model characterized by dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is put forward, which considers the effect of strain softening due to DRK Theoretically, the atomic diffusibility and the driving force of dislocation migration are dependent on the temperature according to the flow rule, and the dislocation density and the cumulation of grain boundary energy are dependent on the strain rate. So, in this model, the peak stress is taken as the function of the temperature and the strain rate according to the creep equation. Since the DRX is a thermally activated process, the recrystallized volume fraction can be regarded as the function of strain through Avrami equation. The descending of flow stress is mainly dominated by the recrystallized volume fraction. On the base of this idea the flow stress at different strain is regarded as the function of the peak stress arid the strain. This new constitutive model shows the dependence of the flow stress on various temperatures, strain rates and strains, which is suitable for metal with DRX such as structural steel 35CrMo, 20CrMnTi and magnesium alloy AZ31B. Statistical analysis shows the calculated values of this new model are in accordance with the experimental values.

58649108500	Simulation of sheet metal extrusion processes with Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian method	An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian(ALE) method was employed to simulate the sheet metal extrusion process, aiming at avoiding mesh distortion and improving the computational accuracy. The method was implemented based on MSC/MARC by using a fractional step method, i.e. a Lagrangian step followed by an Euler step. The Lagrangian step was a pure updated Lagrangian calculation and the Euler step was performed using mesh smoothing and remapping scheme. Due to the extreme distortion of deformation domain, it was almost impossible to complete the whole simulation with only one mesh topology. Therefore, global remeshing combined with the ALE method was used in the simulation work. Based on the numerical model of the process, some deformation features of the sheet metal extrusion process, such as distribution of localized equivalent plastic strain, and shrinkage cavity, were revealed. Furthermore, the differences between conventional extrusion and sheet metal extrusion process were also analyzed. Â© 2008 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

The acceleration/deceleration modes, especially deceleration mode, have an important effect on them. The linear deceleration mode is a commonly used deceleration mode. In conventional linear deceleration mode, there is a positioning stage at low speed for a long time after decelerating to ensure the positioning accuracy, because of the "dead zone" and the deceleration point error. In this paper, firstly, some problems in the conventional linear deceleration algorithm are analyzed. Then an improved linear acceleration/deceleration is introduced. In this algorithm, the deceleration point is predicted exactly, and then the deceleration point error is compensated for at higher feedrates. Furthermore, a higher resultant maximum acceleration than that in the conventional scheme is selected to shorten the acceleration/deceleration time. Thus, the positioning stage in conventional scheme is almost cancelled. Compared with that of conventional linear acceleration and deceleration algorithm, the system performance has been significantly improved.

By using the model of elastic-rigid plastic constitutive relation and plane stress model, the correlation of elastic layer in drill pipe with curvature of the drill pipe under an inner pressure is determined, and the relations of limit moment and the middle layer of strain with inner pressure and axial load of drill pipe are also suggested. According to the material of drill pipe and the track of whipstock, it is concluded that the middle layer of the bent drill pipe is less affected by the curvature, but the position of middle layer is quite affected by the inner pressure and axial load. The bent drill pipe shows a press-bending feature on the cross-section and a stretch-bending feature along the axial direction under the action of inner pressure and the axial resistance during drilling process. This result can provide a theoretical foundation for controlling the deformation of cross-section of drill pipe and for the design of the track of whipstock.

79960323018	The experimental study on combustion characteristics and emissions of a CMM fueled engine	In this paper, an experimental study on combustion characteristics and emissions of a single cylinder spark ignition engine fueled with coal-mine methane (CMM) is investigated under various loads. CMM is simulated by the compressed nature gas (CNG)/nitrogen blend fuels. Based on experiment results, it is shown that under 0%~35% nitrogen volume fraction in CNG/nitrogen blends, the maximum cylinder pressure, the maximum rate of pressure rise and the rate of heat release decrease, the flame propagation period increases, the center of heat release curve is closed to the top dead centre (TDC) markedly with the increase of nitrogen volume fraction. Meanwhile, the hydrocarbon (HC), CO emissions increase, the NOX emission decreases apparently with the increase of nitrogen volume fraction. Â© by HIGH TECHNOLOGY LETTERS PRESS.

80355125456	Effect of hydrogen addition fraction on combustion performance of low heat value gas engine	Based on bench test, combustion performance tests of 2 typical low heat value (LHV) gas fuels, i.e., coal seam gas and biogas mixed with hydrogen for engine were studied. The influences of hydrogen addition fraction on engine combustion performance parameters and combustion stability of LHV gas engine were analyzed respectively. The results show that the hydrogen addition to LHV gas can improve the combustion performance of the LHV gas engine. The maximal pressure increases, the crank angle positions of the maximal pressure were advanced. Meanwhile, hydrogen addition can decrease the flame development duration. The mean indicated pressure of engine shows higher and concentrated value with increase of hydrogen addition. This effectiveness becomes more remarkably at high hydrogen addition fraction.

0038505027	New flexible acceleration and deceleration algorithm	The traditional acceleration/deceleration algorithms such as the linear and the exponential are not suitable for high-speed motion because there would be impacts existing in motion. A new flexible acceleration/deceleration algorithm suitable for high-speed motion system was introduced, in which the trigonometric function was used to construct the acceleration/deceleration functions. In this algorithm, the velocity, acceleration, jerk and displacement are all consecutive so that the system is more flexible and the flexible impacts are completely avoided. This algorithm was analyzed and discussed in detail, supplying a new method for the design of NC motion system.

0042158730	Tracking control and reference trajectory generation in a LOM system	An improvement in contour accuracy is acquired by the introduction of a tracking controller and a trajectory generation policy in a laminated object manufacture (LOM) system. A model of the positioning system is developed as the design basis of the tracking controller. A zero phase error tracking controller (ZPETC) is used to eliminate single axis following error, and thus reduce the contour error. Then the cross-coupled controller (CCC) is introduced to further minimise the contour error caused by the two-axis mismatch; the method of off-line generating of two-dimension reference trajectories followed by the positioning system is proposed. Simulation is developed using a Matlab model and satisfactory results are obtained.

0042322878	Self-Adaptive Dynamic Matrix Control for High-Speed Machining Servo Control	The most serious problem that a current high-speed machining (HSM) servo control faces is that when the curve with a "corner" is machined, as the feedrate increases, the cutting accuracy decreases, and over-cutting is much greater than in traditional CMC. The whole accuracy of HSM is thus affected. The problem cannot be solved only by traditional control strategies. Predictive control, which possesses the functionality of predicting the state of the forward path, is a better way to solve the above issue. In this paper, a dynamic matrix control (DMC), whose control algorithm is very simple and easy to implement, is applied to an HSM CNC. A modified DMC control strategy, called self-adaptive PID-DMC control (APDMC), is developed. The aim of this paper is to present this predictive approach and its application for HSM CNC. Simulation and tests prove that APDMC can be applied satisfactorily to HSM CNC.

0141619342	A finite-element-based study of the load distribution of a heavily loaded spur gear system with effects of transmission shafts and gear blanks	Spur gears were typically analyzed in the past using two-dimensional (2-D) Finite Element (FE) models. This is not adequate in many cases. A three-dimensional (3-D) FE model of a spur gear system, which accommodates all the gear teeth, the gear bodies, and the two transmission shafts, is developed in this paper using a sub-structuring method. The load between pinion and gear wheel is delivered by elastic frictional contact. The contact problem is solved according to the FE parametric quadratic programming method. The paper presents the shape of the contact region as well as the load distribution along the tooth width and profile. The results show that the transmission shafts have significant effects on the contact conditions including load distribution, contact region, and load deviation. The proposed method also applies to other types of gearing.

0141937626	A High-Speed Positioning Method for Servo Systems	The positioning accuracy and positioning time of CNC systems have recently been the main performance criteria for industrial applications. The acceleration/deceleration modes, especially the deceleration modes, have an important effect on them. In this paper, firstly, some problems of the conventional linear deceleration algorithm are analyzed. Then an improved linear acceleration/deceleration algorithm is introduced. In this algorithm, the deceleration point is predicted exactly, and then the deceleration point error is compensated for at higher feedrates. Furthermore, a higher resultant maximum acceleration than that in the conventional scheme is selected to shorten the acceleration/deceleration time. Compared with the conventional linear acceleration and deceleration algorithm, the system performance has been significantly improved. Finally, the performance is confirmed by several simulations and experiments.
