84940349298	Therapeutic potential of non-adherent bone marrow-derived stem cells for acute radiation injury	BACKGROUND: Effective treatment for severed acute radiation sickness (over 8 Gy) has not been obtained at present. Mesenchymal stem cells, which are shown to secrete hematopoietic cytokines and support hematopoietic progenitors, play an important role in cute radiation sickness. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic potential of non-adherent bone marrow-derived stem cells in the treatment of acute radiation injury induced by 8.5 Gy X-ray irradiation, as well as the mechanisms involved. METHODS: Non-adherent marrow-derived stem cells from the long bone of fetal limbs were collected for analyzing surface antigens, cell cycle, osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potential, and expressions of vascular endothelial growth factors and Annexin A2. After being exposed to 8.5 Gy total body irradiation, BALB/C mice were randomly assigned into transplantation group and control group. Mice in the transplantation group were given 3×10<sup>6</sup> CFDA-SE labeled human non-adherent bone marrow-derived stem cells, and those in the control group were given 0.3 mL normal saline. Then, the survival rate, peripheral white blood cells at different time, pathologic change and angiogenesis of the bone marrow were observed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: After X-ray irradiation, transplanted non-adherent mesenchymal stem cells appeared to have a homing to the site of injury. The survival rate of mice in the transplantation group was much higher than that in the control group. Compared with the control group, the white blood cells in the transplantation group decreased more slowly while recovered more rapid: the nadir appeared at day 14 after transplantation while it recovered within 30 days. The bone marrow of mice in the transplantation group regenerated more actively and had more hematopoietic islands than those in the control group on day 21. In addition, bone marrow angiogenesis of the transplantation group was more obvious than that of the control group. In conclusion, human fetal non-adherent bone marrow-derived stem cells could promote bone marrow angiogenesis in a mouse model of acute radiation injury, through which they could play an important role in tissue regeneration of acute radiation injury.

15044344618	Influence of air/water ration on integrated membrane bioreactor	Aimed to the power problem and the effects of air/water ration on MBR effluent, the optimal operate parameter was found on air/water ratio on DO and the effect of DO on the COD, Ammonia-nitrogen removal rate was examined. The experiment showed that the optimal air/water ratio was 35:1, 25:1, 17:1 to the optimal corresponding MLSS 4.23, 4.09, 3.70 g/L. And under the condition, DO could satisfy the microorganism metabolism. As the MLSS dropped, the DO change rate was raised. The DO change had little effect to the COD removal. But the experiment demonstrated the DO was the key factor to the ammonia-nitrogen removal. Under the high MLSS condition, the ammonia-nitrogen removal rate was high when DO valve was 7.63 to 4.85 mg/L. And the ammonia-nitrogen removal rate descended as the DO value hoisted. When DO valve was low, the ammonia-nitrogen removal was not good.

18744414496	Influence of temperature on energy loss and the recoverability of polluted membrane in IMBR	The concepts of unit pressure loss for membrane and the increment of unit pressure loss for membrane are introduced. On this foundation, the degree of energy loss of the water filtered through membrane of two temperature conditions was contrasted. By combining the test results, the findings show that if the membrane flux and other operation parameter are constant it is smaller at the higher temperature, but after membrane flux is enlarged, the influence of temperature weakened. The data of clear water filters experiment were carried on the linear recurrence with the slope representing the average unit pressure loss for membrane and this parameter was adopted to reflect the capability of being renewed of the polluted membrane in integral membrane bioreactor (IMBR), and a conclusion is therefore reached that the higher the temperature is, the bigger the capability of being recovered of the polluted membrane is.

28744457286	Test and combined estimation of integrated membrane bioreactor IMBR	Resistance of per cubic meter water treated by per square meter membrane within per hour and weight of contaminant treated by per square meter membrane per Pa pressure difference increased are put forward in the paper to estimate MBR. IMBR for domestic wastewater and bath wastewater is tested and is estimated with resistance increasing of per cubic meter water treated by per square meter membrane, resistance increasing of per kg contaminant treated by per square meter membrane and weight of contaminant treated by per square meter membrane per Pa membrane pressure difference increased. The test indicates that domestic wastewater and bath wastewater treated by IMBR are up to the Standard for Domestic Water Quality that is non-contact with human body. The wastewater quality is affected by HRT but not by water temperature. Lower temperature and smaller HRT make membrane pollution fast and contaminant treated by per square meter membrane per Pa increased pressure difference lost. If COD in wastewater is low, the sludge will be low in the IMBR as well as the contaminant treated by per square meter membrane per Pa increased pressure difference. Therefore resistance increasing of per cubic meter water treated by per square meter membrane, resistance increasing of per kg contaminant treated by per square meter membrane and weight of contaminant treated by per square meter membrane per Pa membrane pressure difference increased are suitable for MBR estimation. Too small HRT and too much water quantity per square meter and per hour are not suitable for MBR. And HRT as 4h and water quantity per square meter and per hour as 10 L/m

33644642584	Ascertaining of rainstorm intensity formula with the accelerated and converging stable and inhibiting genetic algorithm	The accelerated and converging stable and inhibiting genetic algorithm is an improved new method of ascertaining the rainstorm intensity formula. It is based on the basic genetic algorithm through changing the terminative condition of the former genetic algorithm. It poses that the inner and outer cycle during the inhibiting and stable convergence is the terminative condition. The inhibiting stable convergence of inner cycle refers to the successive times when the average fit degree of the last generation genus approaching the next one exceed the value set beforehand. It also denotes that the number of inheritable evolving generation exceeds the terminative condition number set beforehand. The inhibiting stable convergence of outer cycle refers to comparing the errors of several inner cycle results. When the successive times when the next inner cycle error is less than that of the last one exceed the number set beforehand, then the program exits and the results of this innercycle can be used as the optimal solution. This method has the advantage of faster converging velocity and more stable numerical value. Through comparison and practice validation, the problem that the basic genetic algorithm has the disadvantage of slow converging velocity and easily plunging part optimization has been solved.

The experiment is divided into two stages. First compare the removal rate between the inoculated pillar and naturally formed pillar under the same outside condition. Second stage, put out the germ under the high heat and pressure and study the effect of the microorganism in the course of manganese removal by contrasting the manganese removal rate between pillar A and pillar B.10 days later, the manganese removal rate of pillar A became different from that of pillar B.25 days later, the manganese removal rate of pillar A and pillar B was the same. The results showed that the formed period of the filter media was a comparative conception. The adoption of microorganism inoculation could shorten the formed period. The microorganism played a promoting not a decisive role in the course of manganese removal. The nonbiological function of chemical oxidation, physical sorption and biological course couldn't be ignored.

33747410853	Experiment of ultraviolet inactivation on city wastewater	In order to investigate the inactivation efficiency of ultraviolet (UV) reactor on the secondary wastewater, the UV inactivation experiment on the secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant was carried out. Different water layer thickness, different radiation time and photoreaction effect were experimented. Four closed disinfection reactors were adopted, and the water layer thicknesses were 10.5 mm, 20 mm, 31 mm and 40.5 mm respectively. The inactivation efficiencies of the four reactors were detected in 9 radiation times which were 3 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, 70 s and 100 s. And we investigated the photoreaction effect with the two reactors of 20 mm and 31 mm water layer thicknesses. The investigation showed that thinner water layer led to few surviving bacteria in the same radiation time, and it was more apparent in short radiation time; longer radiation led to few surviving bacteria in the same water layer thickness; the microorganisms in the water samples would become photo-reactivate after UV inactivation. We could conclude that the inactivation ratio of organisms in wastewater may be above 99.9% after being radiated by UV. Radiation time and water layer thickness are two main factors of influencing inactivation effect. Longer radiation time and less water layer thickness led to better disinfection effect of wastewater by UV. To some extent, photo-reactivation also influences inactivation effect, supplying more ultraviolet dose may reduce the reviving ratio of microorganisms.

33846340859	Phosphorous removal by different media in subsurface flow constructed wetlands	The objectives were to estimate the phosphorous removal capacities of the five media that are Limestone, Wollastonite, Zeolite, Light Expanded Clay Aggregate (LECA) and Sand, and to find one or two suitable media for P-removal in constructed wetlands. In the experiment, P-sorption capacities of tested media were compared by P-sorption isotherm and kinetics and the characteristics also were related with the P-removal. At initial concentration of 320 mg·L-1, the P-sorption capacity of the media was Limestone > Wollastonite > Zeolite > LECA > Sand. In the condition of pH 6.60-7.69, the most important characteristics of the media determining their P-sorption capacity was their content of Calcium (Ca) and Aluminium (Al). The changed P concentration remarkably influences the P sorption of different materials. The P sorption quilibrium time and the P sorption velocity of different media were different, and the P sorption velocity of different media didn't have relation with their P sorption capacities. Limestone and Wollastonite are better media which also can be used mixing with sand and P-removal capacity of LECA can be improved by adding some Ca compounds to parent materials in the production process.

Four strains of bacteria, which show similar periodicity in their oxidation on iron, are obtained on the surface of mature manganese sand. Their structures were examined and the effects of time on the removal of iron and manganese were also checked so as to select the most effective iron and manganese removing bacteria. The oxidation of mixed bacteria is stronger than that of unitary bacteria. The change of bacteria quantity as well as the interaction between iron and manganese affects pH of the solution. The change of the pH helps us to know the effect of the germs on iron and manganese as well as the increase and decrease of the quantity of the bacteria. The bacteria's oxidation of iron and manganese is not only subject to bacteria quantity, but to pH of the solution and the strain of the bacteria as well.

By experiment, Strain S10 was obtained from the soil polluted by petroleum. When immobilized with PVA, the activity of strain S10 degradating phenol waste would be about 90%. Moreover, the properties of immobilized cells would change greatly: The optimum temperature and pH of free cells were 30°C and 7.0 respectively, and no more than 10% degradation activity was remained when it had been kept at 80°C, for 20 minutes. While, if the strain S10 was immobilized with PVA, the optimum temperature and pH were 40°C and 7.0 respectively, and the degradation activity was more than 50% after treated at 80°C for 120 minutes. It could be anticipated that microbial degradation of phenol waste has a broad future.

The experimental result shows within which range YG and b increases with the increase of temperature. In comparison with the change of YG, the value of b goes more evenly. Therefore, below 30°C, YG goes up with the fall of the temperature; when the temperature is above 30°C, YG goes up with the rising of the temperature.

Glass centrifuge tube and plastic centrifuge tube are used for separating algal from water. The fluid sample is deepfrozen in refrigeratory under 4°C for different time during separating chlorophyll-a from algal. After the fluid sample is put in spectrophotometer for different time, which is called stabilization time, the absorbency of the sample is taken. The test result indicates that chlorophyll-a of fluid sample measured through plastic centrifuge tube is averagely higher by 30.1% than glass tube because of plastic disturbance. If stabilizing for less than 5 minutes chlorophyll-a of fluid sample increases rapidly along with stabilization time increasing. If stabilizing for more than 5 minute chlorophyll-a increases very slowly, so the suitable stabilization time is 5 minutes to 10 minutes. If deepfreezing for less than 6 hours chlorophyll-a of fluid sample increases averagely by 1.92 μg per litre per hour along with the increase of the deepfreezing time. If stabilizing for over 6 hours chlorophyll-a increases very slowly, so the suitable deepfreeze time is 6 hours to 8 hours.

Based on traditional grey forecast foundation [1, 2] and a value carried out by this forecast is added to the row of known numbers, at the same time, an earlier datum is removed and the dimension is maintained, then the next datum is foreseen. Add the new datum to the series again, and repeat the same steps until the forecast is finished [3, 5]. The result shows that the grey information renewal is better than traditional grey information with respect to precision. The small error probability P, mean-square deviation ratio C of the grey information model is better and the relative error of the gray information renewal model is smaller, so it will be more accurate when forecasting the future water demand. By comparison, grey information renewal model can modify the deficiency of traditional grey forecasting and foresee future water requirement accurately.

High-concentration organic wastewater was treated in UASB under room temperature, and the influence of temperature in different range were studied through maintaining COD concentration, HRT and Ph value. Comparing the removal effects in four different temperature ranges, i.e. 8-10°C, 11-14°C, 15-17°C, 18-23°C, the result proved the theory that the activity of anaerobe was enhanced with temperature dropping. The removal above 14°C showed a rising trend. With temperature short-term mutating, the daily average removal changed little, which showed UASB had some adjusting ability to temperature mutation. Different microbe need different temperatures, according to the influence of temperature on anaerobe metabolics speed, so it's not proper to select hypothermia, but the microbe would maintain higher metabolic speed if the problem of acidification in the reactor was strictly controlled. Some wastewater with lower temperature could also select the hypothermia anaerobic treating, when large energy is needed to heat the water.

One was groundwater containing iron and manganese (GIM), the other was GIM polluted by ammonia (GAIM). The results showed that ammonia has almost no influence on iron removal, but has great influence on manganese. Under the condition of 1m/h filter velocity and 10 mg/L average ammonia nitrogen concentration of inlet, the outlet manganese concentration for GAIM was less than 0.1 mg/L after 315 days. When temperature dropped to 18°C below, the manganese concentration of effluent exceeded 0.1 mg/L. When average ammonia nitrogen concentration of inlet for GAIM dropped to 3.27 mg/L, the manganese concentration of outlet for GAIM was less than 0.1 mg/L in winter. And for GIM, the manganese concentration of outlet was less than 0.1 mg/L only after 52 days. Although the filter velocity increased gradually from 1 to 7 m/h, the manganese concentration of effluent was always less than 0.1 mg/L. Therefore, ammonia pollution in the groundwater greatly increases the difficulty of water treatment. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

67649172855	Research on the characteristics of denitrifying phosphorus and nitrogen removal by different electron acceptors	In order to investigate the characteristics of removing phosphorus and nitrogen in wastewater with nitrate and nitrite nitrogen as electron acceptors, two anaerobic/anoxic sequencing batch reactors were adopted to treat compounded wastewater containing phosphorus. Each reactor is with 16 L valid volume, 6.5 h reaction period and 32 days SRT. The operating method was as follows: concentrated inlet-anaerobic agitation (2 h)-anoxic agitation (4 h)-sedimentation (0.5 h)-decanting. At the beginning of anoxic phase, sodium nitrate was put into one reactor (No.1), and sodium nitrite into another reactor (No.2). The reactors were run for two periods each day. The reactors could steadily remove nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously after 2-3 weeks since beginning, which showed that the reactors were started up successfully. The average ratios of removing total phosphorus and nitrate nitrogen in the reactor of No.1 were 69% and 89%, respectively. And the average ratios of removing total phosphorus and nitrite nitrogen in the reactor of No.2 were 75% and 91%, respectively. Partial nitrate nitrogen was transformed to nitrite nitrogen while it was served as electron acceptor, and they played the role of electron acceptors together to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater. It is concluded that both nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen can be served as electron acceptors to remove phosphorus, and they can remove nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously in anoxic condition. Moreover, the efficiency of removing nitrogen and phosphorus by nitrite nitrogen is higher than that by nitrate nitrogen.

84870567918	The application of industry comprehensive water quota in water-saving management	Planning design and projecting management are the two complementary components of water-saving management. The rationality can be ensured, by researching the importance of trade comprehensive water quota in planning management. Through the research of water quota management system, the necessity of water-saving management can be defined. According to the water date of 15 hospitals in Shenyang, the water saving level of these hospitals can be judged by using two kinds of water quota. The results show that there are 10 hospitals meet the requirements by using comprehensive water quota and only 1 hospital fully meet the requirements by detailed water quota. The comprehensive water quota is more suitable for assessment of water as a fixed quota to determine the water saving level. Public water waste is serious, so it has a lot of water saving space. Combined with comprehensive water quota to determine whether the industry meet norm water requirements, the industry which fails to reach the requirements of section water requirements can timely take corresponding measures, make it as soon as possible to meet the requirements. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group.

84894721249	Simulation study on effect of substrate concentration on performance of MFC and biomass growth	Microbial fuel cell (MFC) mathematical model was established with suspended microorganisms, biomass on the electrode material, soluble chemical substrates and intermediary. By simulating the degradation process of the substrate, biomass growth and the electric current production process, the change of microbial biomass and substrate concentration with time, the impact of substrate concentration on biomass, substrate degradation process and electric current generation were investigated. The results showed that when the original microbial biomass is rarely in the solution, microorganisms mainly enriched in the electrode and grew slowly in solution with the MFC operation. Microorganisms growth experienced three phases: delaying period, logarithmic phase and stable period, and the decomposition of substrate needed to undergo three corresponding stages: slow, fast and depleted. When the substrate concentration was greater than 250 mg/L, the time of the microbial delaying, the slow stage time of substrate decomposing, the time of microbial growth to reach a steady period and the substrate end to deplete, the time of the electric current to reach the maximum, all increased with the increase of substrate concentration.
