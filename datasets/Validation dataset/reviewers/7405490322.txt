Methods: The experiment was accomplished in Changhai Hospital in January 2006. By three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis, the biomechanical behavior of ATMFS was emulated and analyzed. The finite element Ba II model of ATMFS was divided into 7 946 units and 2 520 nodes. The finite element Bblmodel was divided into 1 787 units. The number of nodes was 623. The element was a unit with 20 nodes, 4 faces. The finite element model of acetabulum was divided into 5 783 units, the number of nodes was 9 863. And the finite element was a 3D unit with 10 nodes, 4 faces. Results: 1 When the connector fixated acetabulum, in Ba II model, the max compressive and tensile stress of metamorphosed compressive part were 228 MPa and -24.5 Mpa, respectively; in Bblmodel, they were 108 MPa and -4.5 kPa, both far less than its utmost stress and fatigue limit. The initiative memorial bone holding force in Ba II model for maintaining axial stability was 196 N, and the longitudinal initiative memorial compression force in Bblmodel was 125.05 N. 2 The stress distribution in fixed acetabulum and the medial surface of fracture was even, the stress in most nodes was positive stress, which was identical with physiologic loading (the max compressive stress 7.00 MPa). The fracture of near acetabular fossa boundary was tensile stress. Conclusion: The ATMFS has good anti-fatigue and reuse characters. The dynamic memorial compressive stress field is good for the stability of fixation, enhancement of bone healing and prevention of disusing section.

80052607873	Patellar shape-memory fixator for the treatment of comminuted fractures of the inferior pole of the patella	Comminuted and displaced fractures of the inferior pole of the patella are not easy to reduce and it is difficult to fix the fragments soundly enough to allow early movement of the knee. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the internal fixation technique with Patellar Shape-Memory Fixator (PSMF) in acute comminuted fractures of the inferior pole of the patella.We retrospectively studied 25 patients with comminuted fractures of the inferior pole of the patella who were treated with PSMF and followed up for a mean period of 26 months (14 to 60). All the fractures healed at a mean of 6 weeks (5 to 7). The mean grading at the final follow-up was 29.5 points (27 to 30) using the Bostman score, with no observable restriction of movement. No breakage of the PSMF or infection occurred. No delayed union, nonunion, and infection were seen. This technique preserved the length of the patella, reduced the comminuted fragments of the inferior pole and avoided long-term immobilization of the knee. © ASM International.

80052611559	Treatment of nonunion of scaphoid waist with Ni-Ti shape-memory alloy connector and iliac bone graft	After fracture, the unique anatomy and blood supply of the scaphoid itself predisposes to nonunion. Scaphoid nonunion presents a formidable challenge to surgeons because of the difficulties for fixation, and the high failure rate after treatment. The Ni-Ti shape-memory alloy can provide compressive stress at the nonunion site, which is the key point for bone healing. Hence, we designed a shape-memory bone connector named arched shape-memory connector (ASC). We conducted a retrospective study looking at the union rate and complications and correlating the outcome of treatment with this device. The study reviewed a cohort of six consecutive patients presenting with scaphoid waist nonunion, who were treated with ASC and iliac cancellous bone grafting at our center from August 2002 to December 2007. The patients with nonunion achieved a 100% union rate. All the patients who achieved union had good pain relief and improved function. Our study demonstrates that scaphoid waist nonunions can be successfully treated by ASC and iliac bone grafting. © ASM International.

80052611749	Biomechanical study of acetabular tridimensional memoryalloy fixation system	We developed the acetabular tridimensional memoryalloy fixation system (ATMFS), which is made of NiTi shape memory alloy, according to the specific mechanical properties of biological memory material, NiTi shape memory alloy and measured distribution of contact area and pressure between the acetabulum and the femoral head of cadaveric pelvis. Seven formalin-preserved cadaveric pelves were used for this investigation. Pressure-sensitive film was used to measure contact area and pressure within the anterior, superior, and posterior regions of the acetabulum. The pelves were loaded under the following four conditions: (1) intact; (2) following a creation posterior wall fracture defect; (3) following reduction and standard internal fixation with reconstruction plate; and (4) following reduction and internal fixation with a new shape memory alloy device named ATMFS. A posterior wall fracture was created along an arc of 40° to 90° about the acetabulur rim. Creation of a posterior wall defect resulted in increased load in the superior acetabulum (1485 N) as compared to the intact condition (748 N, P = 0.009). Following reduction and internal fixation, the load distributed to the superior acetabulum (1545 N) was not statistically different from the defect condition. Following the fixation with ATMFS, the load seen at the superior region of the actabulum (964 N) was familiar with fixation with reconstruction plate and was not different from intact state (P = 0.45). These data indicate that the use of ATMFS as a fracture internal fixation device resulted a partial restoration of joint loading parameters toward the intact state. ATMFS fixation may result in a clinical benefit. © ASM International.

80052626623	Expression of TGF-β in fractures fixed by nitinol swan-like memory compressive connectors	In this article, the effect of internal fixation of a Nitinol swan-like memory compressive connector (SMC) on the temporal expression of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) at fracture sites is evaluated. Specimens were collected from 35 New Zealand rabbits modeled for bilateral humeral fracture fixed with either SMC or stainless dynamic compression plate (DCP). Five rabbits each were killed at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56. The local positive staining potency, positive area ratio, and positive index of TGF-β were measured using an immunohistochemistry approach (EnVision) in combination with a computerized image analysis system. TGF-β staining was seen in mesenchymal cells, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and in the extracellular matrix of fractures fixed in both the SMC and the DCP samples without a significant difference in staining at both the early stages (days 1 and 3) and day 56. A higher TGF-β content was observed in the fractures fixed with SMC when compared to that of DCP from day 7 to 28. As a conclusion, TGF-β is highly expressed in fractures fixed with SMC during chondrogenesis stage and entochondrostosis stage. Finally, the mechanism of how SMC promoting synthesis and secretion of TGF-β in the process of fracture healing has been discussed. © ASM International.

80052627801	Treatment of clavicular nonunions with shape memory Ni-Ti alloy swan-like bone connector	Disability caused by nonunited fracture of the clavicle is a rare condition that is expressed by local pain. This condition is usually treated by reduction of the fracture and stable fixation with augmentation by autogenous bone graft. This is a retrospective study to assess outcome of the treatment of clavicular nonunion with a novel shape memory Ni-Ti alloy swan-like bone connector (SMC). August, 2003 to December, 2006, 5 consecutive patients with clavicular nonunion were treated using SMC in our hospital. The SMC device was cooled with ice before implantation and then warmed to 40-50 °C after implantation, to produce balanced axial and compression forces that would stabilize the fracture. We have used cancellous bone grafting in all our cases to obtain solid healing. Average follow-up was 37 months (range 25-58). In all patients, satisfactory osseous union was achieved. There was no complication from the hardware. The average Constant score which is for evaluating function of injured shoulder after operation was 86 points (average Constant score for the unaffected shoulder was 95). All patients were very satisfied with the treatment and outcome. The SMC provides a new effective method for fracture fixation and treatment of bone nonunion for clavicle. © ASM International.

84867137869	Three-dimensional photoelastic analysis on the stress distribution of the pelvis under normal gait based on laser rapid prototyping technology	BACKGROUND: Finite element technology is a digital simulation of the real stress situation; however, photoelastic technology can truly display the overall stress distribution of the test model. OBJECTIVE: To make the pelvis photoelastic model by laser rapid prototyping technology, and then to investigate the stress distributions of the pelvis under normal gait loading conditions by three-dimensional photoelastic analysis and to compare the result with that gained by the finite element method. METHODS: The pelvic potoelastic model was made by laser rapid prototyping technology, including the fifth lumbar vertebrae and bilateral proximal femur. Mass loading was imposed on the femur. Four groups of muscles forces were imposed through steel wire fixed on iliac wing, anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine and inferior ramus of pubis. The femur was assumed to adduct for 15° and moved from flexed 22° to extend 12° during four gait phases. After stress froze, slices were cut along the arcuate line. Isochromatic lines and isoclinic lines were observed in the field of polarized light. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 1 Stress was concentrated on the center of ilium posterior superior roof of acetabulum, iliopubic eminence and cacroiliac joint, and the maximum stress was on the posterior superior roof of acetabulum. 2 The main stress was transferred from posterior superior roof of acetabular to the cacroiliac joint and superior ramus of pubis partly. The area from roof to tubercle of the iliac crest loaded more stress with the femur extending. 3 The stress on the acetabular area was mainly from the acetabular contact forces produced by mass loading, and the role of the muscle contraction force was limited. The three-dimensional photoelastic analysis could reflect distribution of stress on acetabulum. The result was in accordance with the data of finite element method.

Methods: 130 patients with intertrochanteric fractures admitted in Department of Orthopaedics, Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA between January 2003 and January 2006 were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into dynamic hip screw group (n = 65) and Gamma nail group (n = 65). The patients underwent routine surgery, and the mean operation time was recorded from skin discission to incision close except closed reduction. Intra- and postoperative blood loss (percentage of hematocrit) and mobility 9 months after surgery were statistically analyzed. In addition, biocompatibility of host responses to implanted materials was observed. Results: 130 cases were followed-up with average time of 9 months. 1 Mean operation time and blood loss in Gamma nail group and dynamic hip screw group were 47.1 minutes (range, 13-120 minutes), 160 mL; 53.4 minutes (range, 30-150 minutes), 152 mL. 2 All patients were found bone union during the 9-month follow up with no inequality in leg length or coxa adducta. The curative effect in Gamma nail group was excellent in 59 cases and good in 3 cases, in dynamic hip screw group was excellent in 60 cases and good in 2 cases. 3 Wound epidermal infection was found in 5 cases treated with Gamma nail, and 1 case treated with dynamic hip screw. Fixation failure such as fixator cutting-out of femoral head or breakage was not found in any case. Conclusion: Gamma nail and dynamic hip screw can be used to treat stable fractures, but the latter method is a lower-cost option, while for unstable fractures, the superior biomechanics of Gamma nail are relied upon.

This study analyzed the treatment of patellar fracture using NT-PC based on the concept of physiological osteogenic stress. Methods: 106 patients with patellar fracture who were treated by NT-PC in Changhai Hospital of Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA between January 2003 and January 2006 were selected, including 75 males and 31 females, with an average age of 39.3 years (range, 16-72 years). All fracture was closed fracture within 3 hours to 7 days before surgery. 2 PC was made of Nickel and Titanium memory alloy by Seemine, Gansu. It consisted of 5 concentrator hooks and 1 device connecting hook stem, and was classified into large, middle and small types. The concentrator hooks produced sustained, stable, three-dimensional and centripetal compression on patella from 5-9 directions. Moreover, the good bistocompatibility of memory alloy made it possible to become ideal biomaterial for human body. 3X-ray examination was performed to evaluate knee joint function 2, 4, 8 weeks and 5 months after surgery. Results: 106 cases were averagely followed up for 23 months (range, 11-50 months). Radiograph showed that 96 cases obtained anatomic reduction of facies articularis patellae, and the fractured knee function was improved (90 °) after average 3.3 weeks, flexion and extension function restored to normal extent at average 6.9 weeks. According to Bostman scoring system, 99 cases were excellent, and 7 were good. The excellent and good rate was 100%. PC loosening and breakage were not found postoperatively. No inflammation or rejection responses were found. Conclusion: NT-PC can fix bone fragments reliably and provide continuous compression axially during fracture union, and accordingly promote the union of fractures.

60849091952	Influence of swan-like memory connector on the contents of local insulin-like growth factor I during fracture union	Background: Swan-like memory connector (SMC) can form a three-dimensional fixation on long bone shaft, ensure the stability of fracture ends, and produce a continuous dynamic compressive stress on the fracture ends. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) regulates bone development and metabolism, cell differentiation, as well as mitosis. During the union process of fracture, IGF-I is effective to promote cellular proliferation, stimulate bone formation and result in chondrogenesis. Objective: To quantitatively determine the effect of SMC and conventional dynamic compression plate (DCP) on the concentration of local IGF-I in the union duration of rabbit humerus fracture. Design, time and setting: A controlled observational animal study was performed in the laboratory, Department of Orthopaedics, Changhai Hospital, the Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from January to May in 2007. Materials: SMC was Ni-Ti alloy panel, comprising 50%-53% Ni, was customized by Lanzhou Seemine Shape Memory Alloy Co., Ltd. The temperature of shape recovery was (33±2) °C. Methods: Thirty adult New Zealand rabbits were used in this study and were processed into osteotomy. The experiment sides of rabbit humerus were cut and fixed with SMC at random, serving as SMC group, and the other sides were cut at the same position and fixed with DCP, serving as DCP group. Each five animals were put to death at the time points of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks after internal fixation. Specimens were obtained from the areas that were 0.5 cm besides the fracture line. Main outcome measures: Following internal fixation, the contents of local IGF-I in the specimens of different time points (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks) were determined in both SMC group and DCP group. Results: In the SMC-Ireated group, the contents of IGF-I increased 2 weeks after internal fixation, reached the maximum at 6 weeks, and then decreased at 8-12 weeks. In the DCP-treated group, the contents of IGF-I increased 2 weeks after internal fixation, reached the maximum at 8 weeks, and then decreased at 12 weeks. No significant differences were found between the SMC group and the DCP group at 2, 8, 12 weeks after internal fixation (P > 0.05). Compared with the DCP group, the SMC group had a remarkably higher content of IGF-I at the time points of 3, 4 and 6 weeks (P < 0.05). The difference was the most statistically significant at 4 weeks. Conclusion: Compared with conventional DCP, the SMC could better promote the secretion of IGF-I in fracture and facilitate the fracture union due to the continuous dynamic compressive stress and three-dimensional fixation.

(1)The blood loss o f GN and PFN groups was significantly less than DHS group (P < 0.05); no significant difference was found between any two groups (P > 0.05), but DHS group was the longest while PFN was the shortest. In addition, there was no significant difference in length of stay among groups (P > 0.05). (2) One case of DHS group developed coax vara, and one developed injured extremity crispation. In GN group, one case had fracture of shaft of femur. No complications were found in PFN group, all fracture healed at the primary stage. Wound epidermal infection was found in 4 cases treated with Gamma nail (2 wound liquification, 2 superficial infection), and 6 case treated with dynamic hip screw, including 3 wound liquification, 2 superficial infection and 1 deep infection. Fixation failure such as fixator cutting-out of femoral head or breakage was not found in any case. (3) Harris scores for hip joint showed that there were 23 cases excellent, 4 good, and 3 fine in DHS group, with excellent and good rate of 90.0%; 24 excellent, 4 good, and 2 fine in GN group, with excellent and good rate of 93.3%; 32 excellent, 2 good, and 1 fine in PFN group, with excellent and good rate of 97.1%. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Application of DHS, GN and PFN in treatment of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly exhibits no significant difference in efficacy. Gamma nail and PFN can shorten the operation time to reduce the amount of blood loss and postoperative complications. For the stable fracture, all three fixtures can be used, and the DHS is the cheaper; for instable fracture, PFN and GN due to the biomechanical advantages are good choices.

67651151081	Stress-shielding effect of nitinol swan-like memory compressive connector on fracture healing of upper limb	In this article, the stress-shielding effect of a Nitinol swan-like memory compressive connector (SMC) is evaluated. Patients with fracture healing of an upper limb after SMC internal fixation or stainless steel plate fixation were randomly selected and observed comparatively. With the informed consent of the SMC group, minimal cortical bone under the swan-body and swan-neck was harvested; and in the steel plate fixation group, minimal cortical bone under the steel plate and opposite side to the steel plate was also harvested for observation. Main outcome measurements were taken such as osteocyte morphology, Harversian canal histological observation under light microscope; radiographic observation of fracture healing, and computed tomography quantitative scanning of cortical bone. As a conclusion, SMC has a lesser stress-shielding effect to fixed bone than steel plate. Finally, the mechanism of the lesser stress-shielding effect of SMC is discussed. © 2009 ASM International.

68349092727	Treatment of tibial plateau fractures with high strength injectable calcium sulphate	The aim of this article is to discuss the clinical efficacy of high strength injectable calcium sulphate (MIIGX3) in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures. Thirty-one patients with tibial plateau fractures treated with MIIGX3 were included. Postoperative radiographic study was used to evaluate congruity of the articular surface, bone regrowth, and the absorption process of MIIGX3. Rasmussen's score system was adapted for the postoperative knee function recovery assessment. Twenty-eight of 31 patients were followed-up successfully with an average follow-up length of 14.6 months. Complete fracture healing was found in all patients. Complications included wound exudation and articular subsidence. Postoperative knee function was good according to Rasmussen's score system. Six months after surgery, radiographs demonstrated equivalent bone density in the previous area of MIIGX3 as that of surrounding cancellous bone. The use of MIIGX3 in the treatment of tibial plateau fractures provides adequate intraoperative stability and improves the safety of early knee motion. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

70449640037	Implantation of Gamma nail and proximal femoral nail for the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly: A randomized follow-up for 131 cases	OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effect between Gamma nail and proximal femoral nail (PFN) on the treatment for femoral intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. METHODS: A total of 131 cases (39 males and 92 females; aged 70-81 years, mean age of 76 years) with femoral intertrochanteric fractures were collected from the Department of Orthopaedics, the Affiliated Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from January 2005 to January 2008. Femoral intertrochanteric fractures were classified based on AO system, including type A1 (n=56) and type A2 (n=75). All cases were randomly divided into Gamma nail group (n=65) and PFN group (n=66). Pre- and post-operative blood loss, blood transfusion volume, operating time, and length of stay were recorded, while the complications were detected following nail implantation. Functional changes of injured limbs were detected after 9 months. RESULTS: At 9 months after following up, there was no significant difference in blood loss, blood transfusion volume, operating time, and length of stay between the two groups before and after implantation (P > 0.05). Furthermore, complications did not occur during or after implantation. Six cases in the PFN group had infection in which of them had diabetes mellitus. There were no complications such as cutting out of femoral head, femoral shaft fractures, breakage of internal device or pushing out phenomenon. All cases got bone union at the final follow-up of nine months and did not get nonunion, delayed union of fractures or shortening of injured extremity. CONCLUSION: Gamma nail and PFN have equal effect on the treatment of femoral intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly.

77950917053	Shape memory Ni-Ti alloy swan-like bone connector for treatment of humeral shaft nonunion	From August 1990 to December 2007, 156 patients with humeral shaft nonunion were treated with our patented Ni-Ti shape memory alloy swan-like memory pressure connector (SMC). The SMC device cooled with ice before implantation was warmed to 40-50°C after implantation to produce balanced axial and compression forces to stabilise the fracture three-dimensionally. This combined with autologous bone grafting achieved bone tissue regeneration in the fracture and promoted smooth recovery of joint function, with a nonunion healing rate of 98.7% after a single SMC implantation. Failure of nonunion healing occurred in only two cases but was successfully managed by a further operation. Complications were not found in any of these patients apart from four with pre-existing radial nerve injuries. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMC device for the management of humeral shaft nonunion. The device provides continuous compression of the fracture with minimal trauma to the local blood supply. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77955352875	Development of a reconstructive posterior acetabular defect model in dogs and related biomechanical research	Objective: To construct a model of posterior acetabular defect and evaluate the effect of the reconstructive posterior wall on the contact of the acetabulum and femoral head. Methods: The entire pelvis and articulated femur were obtained from six fresh adult canine cadavers. Animal models of posterior acetabular defects were developed by removing the 60° arc fragment. Different measures were used to reconstruct the defect areas with iliac crest autograft. The pressure-sensitive films were used to calculate the contact area, the mean pressure and the distribution of the pressure between the acetabulum and femoral head. Results: The contact area was smaller after reconstruction of posterior wall compared with that of intact posterior wall. The contact areas were not significantly different between the common reconstruction group and the anatomic reconstruction group under a load of 250 N (P>0.05). The mean contact stress of the anatomic reconstruction group was significantly less than that of the common reconstruction group (P<0.05), indicating the collection of pressure was less than that of the common reconstruction group. Conclusion: Animal models of posterior acetabular defects induced by posterior wall osteotomy can effectively mimic the clinical condition; the anatomic reconstruction of the posterior wall can restore the total contact area and the distribution of the pressure within the acetabulum similar to the normal condition.

77955909877	Fibular head osteotomy: A new approach for the treatment of lateral or posterolateral tibial plateau fractures	Background: A variety of surgical approaches have been employed previously for the open reduction and internal fixation of the fractures of lateral and posterolateral tibial plateau. However, the commonly used lateral approach does not provide adequate exposure and access to the posterolateral aspect of the lateral tibial plateau. We developed a new approach with osteotomy of fibular head to solve this problem and report its preliminary result. Methods: Eighty-two patients with lateral or posterolateral tibial plateau fractures had been treated by this approach. According to the fractures, partial or full heads of the fibula were removed, and knee joint function, including stability of the knee, was evaluated by X-ray and physical examinations. Results: All 82 cases were followed up for a mean of 3.2 y 2.0-5.6 y). In each case, the fractures were completely healed and knee joint function was restored. No infection or skin and bone necrosis were found. After one year following the operation, functional assessment of the knee joints by Rasmussen's functional grading system revealed a mean score of 27.9 (24-30). In addition, the radiological assessment by Rasmussen's anatomical grading system resulted in a mean score of 16.8 (14-18). Six patients experienced occasional pain or bad wither pain around knee joints, three of which had lateral-longitudinal instability of knee joint and three lost height of the tibial plateau. Conclusions: The new approach provides excellent visualization, which can facilitate the reduction and internal fixation for lateral or posterolateral tibial plateau fractures, and shows encouraging results. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77957661512	Application of a shape-memory alloy internal fixator for treatment of acetabular fractures with a follow-up of two to nine years in China	Displaced acetabular fractures should be treated surgically. Over the past decade, surgical approaches to the acetabulum and the surgical technique for repair of common fracture patterns have advanced. Excellent outcomes after repair of these injuries can be achieved. The aim of this study was to assess the medium-term results of reconstruction of acetabular fractures by using shape-memory alloy designed by the authors. This is a retrospective review conducted at a level 1 trauma centre. From October 1999 to July 2009, 19 patients with acetabular fractures were treated with our patented Ni-Ti shape-memory alloy acetabular tridimensional memory alloy-fixation system (ATMFS). The ATMFS device was cooled with ice before implantation and then warmed to 40-50°C after implantation to produce balanced axial and compression forces that would stabilise the fracture three dimensionally. Our results are as follows; according to the D'Aubigne-Postel scoring system: Fifteen cases out of 19 (79%) achieved excellent or good clinical results. In two patients, late complications included avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH) associated with posterior dislocation of the hip joint two years after the operation. We also observed two cases of grade II or III ectopic ossification, with good hip function, and one case of traumatic arthritis. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ATMFS device for the management of acetabular fracture. The device provides continuous compression of the fracture with minimal disruption to the local blood supply. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

79851474974	Swan-like memory compressive connector	Nonunion is a common complication after fractures of the diaphysis of the upper extremity. Conventional internal fixation cannot provide compressive stress at the fracture site, which is critical for fracture repair in nonweight-bearing bones. In order to overcome this problem, we developed a novel nitinol device that provides initial and continuous compression and three dimensional fixation, the swan-like memory compressive connector (SMC). A total of 188 cases (243 bones) of fractures and nonunions were treated by SMC over the course of 16 years. At follow-up, the nonunion sites were bridged by plate-like bone in 92 cases (106 bones) at an average of 3.8 months after surgery. In the fracture group, the fracture sites were bridged by plate-like bone in 93 cases (134 bones) at an average of 2.6 months after surgery. No infection or re-fracture occurred after removal of the SMC. There was no persistent joint dysfunction caused by the SMC. © 2010 ASM International.

79851503108	Design and clinical application of proximal humerus memory connector	Treatment for comminuted proximal humerus fractures and nonunions are a substantial challenge for orthopedic surgeons. Plate and screw fixation does not provide enough stability to allow patients to begin functional exercises early after surgery. Using shape memory material nickel titanium alloy, we designed a new device for treating severe comminuted proximal humerus fractures that accommodates for the anatomical features of the proximal humerus. Twenty-two cases of comminuted fracture, malunion, and nonunion of the proximal humerus were treated with the proximal humeral memory connector (PHMC). No external fixation was needed after the operation and patients began active shoulder exercises an average of 8 days after the operation. Follow-up evaluation (mean 18.5 months) revealed that bone healing with lamellar bone formation occurred an average of 3.6 months after surgery for the fracture cases and 4.5 months after surgery for the nonunion cases. Average shoulder function was 88.5 according to the criteria of Michael Reese. PHMC is an effective new device to treat comminuted proximal humerus fractures and nonunions. The use of this device may reduce the need for shoulder joint arthroplasty. © 2010 ASM International.

0036429293	Design and clinical applications of swan-like memory-compressive connector for upper-limb diaphysis	There are still some problems in the treatment of fracture and nonunion of upper limb diaphysis. The nonunion is a very common complication. The key to the problem is that formerly internal fixator cannot provide compressive stress at the fracture site. So a Nitinol device with characters of memorial compression and three dimensional (3-D) fixation was designed, named swan-like memorial-compressive connector (SMC). Until August of 2000, 243 bones of 188 cases including 107 bones of 93 nonunion cases and 136 bones of 95 fracture cases were treated by SMC. The results of follow-up 2.25 years in average showed that bridges of plate-like bones were formed 3.8 months in average after operation on the nonunion sites of 106 bones in 92 cases and 2.6 months in average after operation on the fracture sites of 134 bones in 93 cases, respectively. No infection, no refracture after removing the SMC and no joint dysfunction caused by SMC werefound. Therapy results above good accounted for 98.76%.

0036431875	Design and clinical application of olecranon guiding memory fixator	Olecranon fracture is one of the most common fractures. There are several fixation methods to teat it. The most popular is the tension band method. Despite the good therapy results of tension band, receding of pins is very often complicated. In order to solve the problem, especially to provide a simple and efficacious method, we designed a new fixation device made of Nitinol named as olecranon guiding memorial fixator (OGMF). Till October 1999, 21 cases had been treated by OGMF with anatomic reduction rate of 95.7%. Average 6.8 weeks after operation, the function of injured upper limb was as good as the healthy one, and no infection, rupture and nonunion was found.

80051669500	Treatment of lower extremity long bone nonunion with expandable intramedullary nailing and autologous bone grafting	Background Nonunion of long bones in lower limbs is a common complication of orthopedic trauma that can be extremely debilitating. This retrospective study describes our experience using expandable intramedullary nails and autologous bone grafting in treating lower limb long bone nonunion with bone defects. Methods Nineteen patients (mean age 38.9 years, range 18-61) with lower limb long bone nonunion and defects caused by femoral or tibial fracture types were as follows: A2 (3 femoral, 1 tibial), A3 (1 femoral, 2 tibial), B2 (3 femoral, 4 tibial), and B3 (1 femoral, 4 tibial). Expandable intramedullary nailing and autologous bone (iliac and/or fibular) grafting were used for the treatment. Postoperative bone healing as determined by analysis of standard anteroposterior and lateral X-ray films every 4 weeks. Complications were noted. Results The average number of previous surgeries was 1.9 (range 1-4). The mean duration from original injury to treatment was 17.6 months (range 9-40 months). Femoral shaft nonunion healed on average of 26.5 weeks (range 16-60 weeks) after surgery, while tibial shaft nonunion healed on average of 23.6 weeks (range 12-40 weeks) after surgery. Class I healing occurred in all but two patients who experienced chronic postoperative osteomyelitis and delayed wound healing, respectively. Two patients complained of postoperative donor site pain. Conclusions The use of expandable intramedullary nails and autologous bone grafts was an effective method for repair of nonunion of lower limb fractures combining with bone defects with minimal complications. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84863860062	Treatment of bone nonunion and bone defects associated with unsuccessful humeral condylar fracture repair with autogenous iliac bone reconstruction	Background: Our preliminary study retrospectively assessed outcomes after the use of autogenous iliac bone grafts combined with internal fixation to repair refractory bone nonunions and bone defects associated with supracondylar or intracondylar humeral fractures, or both. Materials and methods: We identified 22 patients (14 men and 8 women) with a mean age of 33.8 years (range, 17-60 years) with bone nonunion and severe bone defects associated with supracondylar or intercondylar humerus fractures, or both. The humeral condyle in each patient was anatomically reconstructed using autologous iliac bone grafts and internal fixation. Active functional exercise was initiated 3 to 4 weeks after surgery. The following variables were assessed: preoperative and postoperative elbow range of motion, Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS), and postoperative complications. Results: Mean follow-up was 38.6 months. Mean duration until bone union was 5.6 months. Preoperatively, 16 patients had a fair or poor MEPS (<75). At final follow-up MEPS was excellent (>90) in 8, good (75-90) in 9, fair (60-74) in 4, and poor (<60) in 1 patient. Postoperative heterotopic ossification anterior to the elbow joint occurred in 2 patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that anatomic reconstruction of the humeral condyle using autogenous iliac bone grafting with internal fixation can improve elbow joint function in patients with bone nonunion and bone defects associated with supracondylar or intracondylar humeral fractures, or both. Larger scale studies are warranted to confirm our findings and compare the efficacy of this vs other surgical approaches. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

84867149522	Gross distribution and biomechanical significance of bone trabecula of the cancellous around acetabulum	BACKGROUND: Although a variety of mechanics study on the mechanical characteristics of the pelvis has been performed, but the exact stress distribution in the region remains unclear. ONJECTIVE: To observe the gross distribution of bone trabecula around acetabulum and compare with existing biomechanical research results. METHODS: Four dry pelvic specimens were cut in accordance with the plane which composed of acetabular edge and the plane of obturator in order to observe the distribution patterns of trabecular bone on the cross-section, and to observe the gross distribution of trabecula around acetabulum. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The trabeculae of hip bone were divided into three groups. 1Sacropubic bundle: It ran from the auricular surface, posterior superior iliac spine and posterior inferior iliac spine to pubic symphsis along the iliopectinal line, and part of the trabecula terminated in the posterior superior acetabular. 2Iliocotyloid bundle: It ran from the greater sciatic notch of the auricular surface to the superior posterior acetabular, and located in the shallow layer of the sacropubic bundle. 3Ilioischial bundle: From the region of the iliac crest to the ischial tuberosity, part of the trabecula terminated in the anterior superior acetabular. High-density trabecular net transversely located at the level of the sciatic notch, defined by a distinct saltire-shaped crossing over the acetabulum between the sacropubic and the ilioischial bundles. The human hip acetabulum was constituted by iliocotyloid bundle, sacropubic bundle and ilioischial bundle. High-density trabeculum net transversely located at the level of the sciatic notch, iliopubic eminence and the cross-section of sacropubic and the ilioischial bundles. This is consistent with the stress distribution and loading of the acetabular region in the current research.

84878633254	Modified posterior soft tissue repair for the prevention of early postoperative dislocation in total hip arthroplasty	Purpose: Dislocation following total hip arthroplasty (THA) with the posterior approach has been quite a common and bothering complication. Previous researches suggest that careful repair of the posterior structures significantly reduces this risk. The purposes of the present study were to describe a modified posterior soft tissue repair procedure in THA using a suture anchor (TwinFix Ti 5.0, Smith & Nephew, Andover, MA) and evaluate the early postoperative dislocation rate. Methods: From July 2004 to June 2008, 220 consecutive primary total hip arthroplasties were performed using the modified surgical approach. The average age in the group was 46.4 years (range from 21 to 90) at the time of the procedure. The rate of postoperative hip dislocation, as well as any signs of complications related to the technique, has been observed and analyzed in this study. Results: There was no postoperative dislocation following primary THA in 220 cases, and no signs of complications related to the technique, such as greater trochanteric fractures and sciatic nerve palsy, have been noted in any of the cases at their most recent follow-up. Conclusions: These initial results demonstrate that the modified repair in THA using the suture anchor can serve as an effective and reliable mean for prevention of early postoperative dislocation © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878241525	The use of a structural free iliac crest autograft for the treatment of acetabular fractures	Introduction: Bone and cartilage deficits in the posterior acetabular wall are severe complications resulting from the unsuccessful management or delayed treatment of acetabular fracture. This potentially disastrous condition cannot be treated reliably with the use of reconstruction plates and screws alone. Therefore, this technical report describes a modified anatomical reconstruction method that uses a structural iliac crest autograft and an acetabular tridimensional memory alloy fixation system (ATMFS) to treat late-stage deficits in the posterior wall of the acetabulum. This paper also describes a clinical study of 22 patients with an average of 6.3 years follow-up to evaluate the clinical outcomes of this method. Methods: Twenty-two patients, who had an acetabular reconstruction between January 2000 and December 2011 that used a structured free iliac crest autograft to treat late-stage bone and cartilage deficits in the posterior acetabular wall were followed annually with clinical and radiographic evaluations. The average age of the patients was 36.4 years at the time of the procedure, and the average time of follow-up was 6.3 years. Results: None of the patients in this study lost reduction after surgery, and there were no cases of implant failure. Radiographic analysis using Matta's X-ray evaluation criteria were excellent in eleven cases, good in eight, and fair on three. The Merle D'Aubigné and Postel clinical outcomes at the final follow-up were as follows: seven cases were excellent, ten cases were good, three cases were fair and two cases were poor. Conclusions: The use of a modified iliac crest grafting and ATMFS fixation, as a biological method to reconstruct the acetabulum anatomically may offer better congruence of the joint surface and may ensure good hip joint stability during early postoperative exercise. The medium to long-term results of this method are encouraging. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

A prospective controlled study	BACKGROUND: Iliac bone graft harvesting is a common procedure in spinal surgery and trauma center for spinal fusion and nonunion of the extremities. AIM, PATIENTS AND METHODS: To compare the pain and cosmetic outcomes of patients undergoing iliac crest anatomical reconstruction using equivalent iliac crest allograft (R group) with those of patients without reconstruction of the iliac crest defect (NR group), a prospective nonrandomized controlled study was conducted. RESULTS: In R group, the intensity and prevalence of pain were significantly lower than those in NR group. Cosmetic outcome and satisfaction score were also significantly improved in R group. One patient of R group suffered from lipolysis and superficial infection which healed by regular dressing change for two weeks. There were no cases of allograft displacement, implant loosening, internal fixation breakage or immunological rejection. Seven patients in NR group had significant pain related to the tenting of skin over the defect. Radiologic incorporation of pelvis was documented in all patients except four having partial re-sorption of the allograft. Early fibrous healing and the late creeping substitution were noted in all patients of R group. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent iliac crest allograft provides an effective alternative for iliac crest anatomical reconstruction, leading to reduced donor site pain and better cosmesis.

84890260186	Application of Ni-Ti Alloy connector for the treatment of comminuted coronal plane supracondylar-condylar femoral fractures: A retrospective review of 21 patients	Background: Our preliminary retrospective study assessed outcomes after the use of Ni-Ti arched shape-memory connector (ASC) combined with partially threaded cancellous screws (PTCS) to repair coronal plane supracondylar-condylar femoral fractures. Methods. Twenty-one patients (16 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 34.1 years (range, 28 to 44 years) with coronal plane supracondylar and condylar fractures of the distal femur were included in this study. Each patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation using the ASC and PTCS. Active functional exercises with restricted weight bearing were initiated the first postoperative day. A gradual increase in weight bearing status and range of motion was permitted and subjects progressed to full weight bearing by 8 weeks. Surgical time, blood loss, postoperative knee range of motion, American Knee Society Scores (KSS), and postoperative complications were assessed. Results: The mean surgical time was 75 mins (range, 45 to 100 mins) and average blood loss was 105 ml (range, 35 to 130 ml). Mean follow-up was 65 months (range, 22 to 90 months). No subjects demonstrated evidence of osteonecrosis or arthritis at the final follow-up. The mean KSS was excellent (≥85) in 8 subjects, good (70-84) in 11 subjects, and fair (60-69) in 2 subjects. The mean active range of motion of knee flexion at final follow-up was 100 degrees (range, 85 to 110 degrees). Conclusions: ASC combined with PTCS can serve as an effective means for managing comminuted femoral fractures that extend from the condyle to the supracondylar region. However, further prospective comparative studies and biomechanical analyses are needed to evaluate long-term outcomes using these materials. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84890898088	Massive heterotopic ossification associated with late deficits in posterior wall of acetabulum after failed acetabular fracture operation	Background: Heterotopic ossification is a common postoperative complication of acetabular fracture. However, functionally significant heterotopic ossification with associated late bone defects in the posterior wall of the acetabulum is rare and challenging to treat. When heterotopic ossification is a late complication of failed acetabular fracture operation, it is disabling and may only be treated by THA. THA is highly susceptible to premature failure in young and active patients and may require numerous revisions. Case presentation. This article describes a 40-year-old man with massive heterotopic ossification associated with late bone defects in the posterior wall of the acetabulum after a failed acetabular fracture operation. The primary fracture type was a 62-A2.3 fracture according to the AO/OTA Classification.Surgical excision and anatomical reconstruction of the acetabular wall using heterotopic ossific bone were performed 10 months after the fracture repair. Postoperatively, indomethacin was administered for prophylaxis against recurrence of heterotopic ossification, and hip range of motion was progressively increased. At 5 years and 6 months follow-up, the patient's pain was relieved and hip function had recovered. Though radiography and CT showed minimal subchondral cysts and mild joint-space narrowing, there was no evidence of graft resorption, progressive posttraumatic osteoarthritis or necrosis of the femoral head. Conclusion: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of such a challenging condition. Although it is an extremely rare case, it provides an attractive option for avoiding THA, as the long-term follow-up shows a satisfactory outcome. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84894089074	Comparative study of comminuted posterior acetabular wall fracture treated with the Acetabular Tridimensional Memory Fixation System	Background Posterior wall fractures are one of the most common acetabular fractures. However, only 30% of these fractures involve a single large fragment, and comminuted acetabular posterior wall fractures pose a particular surgical challenge. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between patients who received fixation for comminuted posterior wall fracture using the Acetabular Tridimensional Memory Fixation System (ATMFS) and patients who underwent fixation with conventional screws and buttress plates (Plates group). Method Between April 2003 and May 2007, 196 consecutive patients who sustained a comminuted posterior wall fracture of acetabulum were treated with ATMFS or conventional screws and buttress plates. Operative time, fluoroscopy time, blood loss, and any intra-operative complications were recorded. Plain AP and lateral radiographs were obtained at all visits (Matta's criteria). Modified Merle d' Aubigne-Postel score, and Mos SF-36 score were compared between groups. Results Fifty patients were included in the analysis with 26 in the ATMFS group and 24 in the Plates group. The mean follow-up time was 57.5 months, ranging from 31 to 69 months. All patients had fully healed fractures at the final follow-up. There was no difference in clinical outcomes or radiological evaluations between groups. Conclusion Patients with comminuted posterior wall fractures of the acetabulum treated with the ATMFS or conventional screws and buttress plate techniques achieve a good surgical result. Both techniques are safe, reliable, and practical. Use of the ATMFS technique may reduce blood loss and improve rigid support to marginal bone impaction. The use ATMFS may need additional support when fractures involve the superior roof. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A cadaveric study	Purpose: Operative treatment of unstable posterior wall fractures of acetabulum has been widely recommended. This laboratory study was undertaken to evaluate static fixation strength of three common fixation constructs: interfragmentary screws alone, in combination with conventional reconstruction plate, or locking reconstruction plate. Methods: Six formalin-preserved cadaveric pelvises were used for this investigation. A posterior wall fracture was created along an arc of 40-90 degree about the acetabular rim. Three groups of different fixation constructs (two interfragmentary screws alone; two interfragmentary screws and a conventional reconstruction plate; two interfragmentary screws and a locking reconstruction) were compared. Pelvises were axial loaded with six cycles of 1500 N. Dislocation of superior and inferior fracture site was analysed with a multidirectional ultrasonic measuring system. Results: No statistically significant difference was found at each of the superior and inferior fracture sites between the three types of fixation. In each group, the vector dislocation at superior fracture site was significantly larger than inferior one. Conclusions: All those three described fixation constructs can provide sufficient stability for posterior acetabular fractures and allow early mobilization under experimental conditions. Higher posterior acetabular fracture line, transecting the weight-bearing surface, may indicate a substantial increase in instability, and need more stable pattern of fixation. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84905541787	Posterior Trochanteric Osteotomy in Acetabular Fractures for 32 Cases	The aim of this study is to explore the method and clinical outcome of posterior trochanteric osteotomy in acetabular fractures. From January 2000 to January 2008, 32 cases of acetabular fractures involving the dome of acetabulum underwent posterior trochanteric osteotomy for a better exposure and internal fixation with acetabular tridimensional memory fixation system. 28 cases (16 men and 12 women, mean age 39.9 years, range 16-73 years) were followed up with an average of 48.9 months (range of 19-95 months) and four were lost during follow up. Of 28 cases, 19 were fresh fractures and 9 were old fractures. The reduction was evaluated with Matta criteria. Clinical evaluation was based on modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel scoring. Motor strength of the abductors was evaluated according to the Medical Research Council grading system. Ectopic ossification was classified according to Brooker criteria. Anatomical reduction was achieved in 17 cases and satisfied reduction in 10 patients. Poor reduction happened in an old fracture. All acetabular fractures got a direct bone union and no displacement and deep infection occurred. All osteotomies healed within 3.5 months without any nonunion, proximal migration of the greater trochanter, loosing or broken of instrumentation, and deep infection. Two superficial infections were healed with a regular dressing. Two patients underwent removal of implants from greater trochanter because of irritation. The strength of the abductors was of Grade 3/5 in two patients, Grade 4/5 in five patients, and normal in the rest. Clinical scoring was excellent to good in 84 %. Ectopic ossification occurred in five patients, grade 1 in two patients, grade 2 in two, and grade 3 in one. But function of hip joint was not seriously affected. Posterior trochanteric osteotomy can provide an adequate exposure of the dome of acetabulum without the associated complications like nonunion, proximal replacement, and weak of the abductors which often occur with standard oblique osteotomy. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.
