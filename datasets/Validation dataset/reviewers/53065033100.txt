84942514083	Video steganography with perturbed macroblock partition	In this paper, with a novel data representation named macroblock partition mode, an effective steganography integrated with H.264/AVC compression is proposed. The main principle is to improve the steganographic security in two directions. First, to embed messages, an internal process of H.264 compression, i.e., the macroblock partition, is slightly perturbed, hence the compression compliance is ensured. Second, to minimize the embedding impact, a high efficient double-layered structure is deliberately designed. In the first layer, the syndrome-trellis codes (STCs) is utilized to perform adaptive embedding, and the costs in visual quality and compression efficiency are both considered to construct the distortion model. In the second layer, facilitated by the wet paper codes (WPCs), an expected 3-bit per change gain in embedding efficiency is obtained.

84942514768	Fast tamper location of batch DNA sequences based on reversible data hiding	Nowadays, more and more DNA sequences are stored in databases of NCBI and other organizations. Based on these databases, much research has been conducted. Once tampered, the research results will be useless and even lead to disastrous consequences. It is significant to protect the integrity of the DNA sequences. This paper proposes a fast tamper location method of batch DNA sequences based on reversible data hiding. A fragile watermarking combining with the Merkle Hash Tree is presented with respect to achieving fast tamper location of batch DNA sequences. With the method in the paper, the tampered blocks can be fast located, especially for dealing with batch DNA sequences. The method can be applied to large databases, where providers can quickly check whether the DNA sequences are intact or not. Besides, users can solve the problem that the sequences may be tampered during transmission.

8844223271	Data model and algebra for capability object integration in heterogeneous data integration systems	In heterogeneous data sources integration systems, there can be many special limited access patterns to access interface of data sources, i.e., binding patterns impose a restriction that one or more input attributes must have a binding, and also restrict the output attributes that are projected. Constrained by the expressiveness of the access interface, users often have difficulty in articulating a precise query over the data sources. We propose a data model for data sources' capability object integration (COIM) to capture a rich variety of query-processing capabilities and present algebra to compute the set of mediator-supported queries based on the capability limitations of the sources they integrate. By computing mediator query capabilities and representing them in the same way as those of data sources, we enable mediators to be used by other mediators as well as other applications, and we also make it easier for end users to know in advance which mediator queries are feasible.

It facilitates more flexible and effective computing resource sharing by constructing P2P overlays among participants. Capability-centered resource scheduling is a new decentralized scheduling for the new volunteer computing environments, which is simple and lightweight.

28444441293	An algorithm for jobs scheduling in computational grid based on time-balancing strategy	The Computational Grid provides a promising platform for the efficient execution of parallel coarse grain tasks computing over very large sample space. Scheduling such applications is challenging for the heterogeneity, autonomy, and dynamic adaptability of grid resources. Assuming resource owners have a preemptive priority, we propose an adaptive algorithm of jobs scheduling based on time balancing strategy, which solves the parallel computing tasks by using the idle resources in Computational Grid. A mathematical model is developed to predict performance, which also considers systems with heterogeneous machine utilization and heterogeneous service distribution. The model separates the influence of machine utilization, job service rate and parallel task allocation on the completion time. According to the time balancing policy, a task is partitioned into several subtasks and scheduled, and the costs of communication are reduced. The expected value of parallel task completion time is predicted with performance model. To get better parallel computing performance, an optimal subset of heterogeneous resources with the shortest parallel executing time of tasks can be selected with the efficient algorithm. Remapping strategy is applied during scheduling, which is more suitable for the dynamic adaptability and domain autonomy in the grid. © 2005 IEEE.

But this is not the case in current STA researches. In previous studies, researchers just organize relevant STA functions according to cognitive level, but pay little attention to the real decision making procedure. To solve this problem, the concept of group analysis and a functional model of it are proposed in this paper with a view not to the cognitive level but to the procedure of military decision making. Then a STA model based on group analysis is established. This model forms the awareness of the whole situation part by part and level by level which is in accord with commanders' cognition procedure. Thus it not only makes the decision aiding more efficiently but also makes the design of military decision support system more conveniently. © 2005 IEEE.

By using OWL Lite as standard ontology language, which is a suitable tradeoff between expressivity of knowledge and complexity of reasoning problems, ontology is generated through translating and integrating domain ontologies. The terms defined in ontology are used as metadata to markup the Web's content; these semantic markups are semantic index terms for information retrieval. We can obtain the equivalent classes of semantic index terms by using description logic reasoner. The logical views of documents and user information needs, generated in terms of the equivalent classes of semantic index terms, can represent documents and user information needs well, so the performance of information retrieval can be improved effectively when suitable ranking function is chosen.

35748971513	Extracting attack to LSB steganography in spatial domain	Many steganalysis techniques have been developed to detect the existence of hidden information. However, there are few approaches about how to extract the hidden information, i.e., extracting attack to steganography. For key-dependent steganography, extracting attack is equivalent to recovering the stego key. By combining detecting techniques in steganalysis and correlation attack in cryptanalysis, the authors propose a new method to recover the stego key of LSB steganography in spatial domain of images. Theoretic analysis is made for this method, which establishes that its complexity is mainly determined by the number of samples and the attack will fail when the embedding rate r tends to 0 or 1. The authors introduce an estimator for the minimum number of samples n based on a mixture Gaussian model. The experiments on the stego software 'Hide and Seek 4.1' show that the proposed method can recover the stego key and extract the hidden message. If the length of messages L is not known, the attack can success for 5.3% < r < 94.7%; if L is known, the attack can success for 1.1% < r < 98.4%, and by using the estimator for n, the attacking speed can be increased by 10%-45% when 11% < r < 50%.

In such "pay-per-use" Grids, workflow execution cost must be considered during scheduling based on users' QoS constraints. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based ant colony optimization algorithm (KBACO) for grid workflow scheduling with consideration of two QoS constraints, deadline and budget. The objective of this algorithm is to find a solution that minimizes execution cost while meeting the deadline in terms of users' QoS requirements. Based on the characteristics of workflow scheduling, we define pheromone in terms of cost and design a heuristic in terms of latest start time of tasks in workflow applications. Moreover, a knowledge matrix is defined for the ACO approach to integrate the ACO model with knowledge model.

It's based on a novel spatial-color feature extraction operator named spatialcolor binary patterns(SCBP). As the name implies, features extracted by this operator include spatial texture and color information. In addition, a refine module is designed to refine the contour of moving objects. Using the proposed method, we improve the accuracy of subtracting the background and detecting moving objects in dynamic scenes. A data-driven model is used in our method. For each pixel, first, a histogram of SCBP is extracted from the circular region, and then a model consist of several histograms is built. For a new observed frame, each pixel is labeled either background or foreground according to the matching degree between its SCBP histogram and its model, then the label is refined and finally the model of this pixel is updated. The proposed approach is tested on challenging video sequences, which shows that the proposed method performs much better than several texturebased methods. © 2011 IEEE.

Then, the two types of pumps are combined together, with the sliding vane pump acting as the feeding pump. Comparison is made between the performance of the independently working pump and the performance of series operation pump. Results show that the system flow rate is determined by the sliding vane pump. In order to ensure the stability of the series operation pumping system, the energy consumption required by the pipeline under the system flow should be greater than the pressure energy centrifugal pump can generate. Otherwise, the centrifugal pump can not operate stably, with reflux, swirl, gas-liquid two-phase flow in the runner and strong vibration and noise.

55149111170	Approach to analyze the procedural semantics of OWL-S based on extended coloured Petri nets	Aiming at the existing problems in procedural semantics of Web Ontology Language for Service (OWL-S), an Process Model net (PM_net) based on extended Colored Petri Nets (CPN) was proposed. It was used to transform and analyze the procedural semantics of OWL-S. According to the characteristics of OWL-S process model, the PM_net extended the transition and fire rules of basic CPN, so that the atomic process, composite process and data flow of OWL-S process model could be equally mapped to PM_net. Reliability analysis problem of the PM_net was decomposed into conflict-resolving and reliability of state stripped net. By adopting analysis tool and principles of traditional Petri net, the reliability of state stripped net was analyzed so as to realize consistence analysis of OWL-S procedural semantics. The studies provided theoretical foundation for the evolution of OWL-S, service composition and verification of semantic Web service.

60749092257	Enhance UDDI and design peer-to-peer network for UDDI to realize decentralized web service discovery	Web Services has emerged as a dominant paradigm for constructing and composing distributed business applications and enabling enterprise-wide interoperability. A critical factor to the overall utility of web services is a scalable, flexible and robust discover mechanism. This paper improves UDDI specification, thus it could guarantee usability of response and append grid-like monitoring information of web service hosting environment to response, but modification to standard UDDI specification does not affect the interoperability. We also present two distributed and scale-well approaches for fully autonomous registries and cooperative registries to overcome the disadvantage of traditional registries. In other words, we provide an unstructured peer-to-peer network for fully autonomous registries and a structured peer-to-peer network for cooperative registries. The two kinds of peer-to-peer network for registries support complex query without influence on interoperability, and they are a suitable candidates to extend traditional web service registries.

69249233516	Recent advances in image-based steganalysis research	Battles between steganography and counter-measures has become an important issue in information security. Aimed at a commonly used cover media, i.e., digital image, this article reviews the recent advances on the frontier of anti-steganography research. Regarding the major challenges posed by the rapid developments of steganographic techniques, the authors outline some typical methods and summarize the technological progress in steganalysis to provide useful information to the researchers on both sides of the cyber warfare. Emphases are laid on three challenging problems, which until a few years ago had been hard to tackle. First, combat the LSB matching steganography that avoids the statistic abnormality existing in the early simple LSB replacement method, either revealing the existence of secret information in a suspected image or estimating the length of the embedded data. Second, detect stego-images that only contain a very small amount of secret data. Third, develop universal detectors or classifiers to carry out steganalysis independent of the steganographic scheme. Some new trends and problems faced by the steganalysts are also discussed.

0034435277	Nonlinear correlation tracking technique in data mining of financial markets	Financial data mining is one of the most challenging research directions in information society. Financial data with random characteristics make it difficult to find out the rule hidden in data. In this paper, it is pointed out that correlation coefficient can not capture nonlinear information, which is the serious defect of classic correlation analysis. Furthermore, the properties of the high-order correlation coefficient are discussed, and it is proved that high-order correlation can not only describe the hidden nonlinear correlation, but also fill up the space between classic correlation and independence. The computational simplicity makes the high-order correlation coefficient be an effective technique to track nonlinear relation between variables. Finally, the above results are applied to the correlative analysis between stock price and stock trading volume, and the computing results show that the high-order correlation coefficient can track the time-varying nonlinear characteristics.

71949083967	Functional dependencies with built-in predicates and its axiomatization	The increasing demand for data quality technology has motivated revisions of classical dependencies to capture more inconsistencies in real-life data. A class of integrity constraints, referred to as functional dependencies with built-in predicates (PFDs), is proposed for relational databases and their axiomatization is investigated. In contrast to traditional functional dependencies (FDs) developed mainly for schema design, PFDs generalize the notions of FDs to apply to subsets of relations specified by constraints in the context of interpreted data, and aim at capturing the consistency of data by enforcing bindings of ranges of semantically related values. For the implication analysis of PFDs, which is to decide whether or not a set of PFDs entails another PFD, we provide an inference system analogous to Armstrong's axioms for FDs, and prove the soundness and completeness of the inference system. This work is a step towards a practical constraint-based method for improving data quality since inconsistencies and errors in databases often emerge as violations of integrity constraints.

77949520885	Near-optimal codes for information embedding in gray-scale signals	High-performance steganography requires large embedding rate and small distortion, i.e., high embedding efficiency. Steganographic codes (stego-codes) derived from covering codes can improve embedding efficiency. In this paper, a new method is proposed to construct binary stego-codes for LSB embedding in gray-scale signals, which shows that not just one but a family of stego-codes can be generated from a covering code by combining Hamming codes and wet paper codes. This method can greatly expand the set of embedding schemes as applied to steganography. Performances of stego-code families (SCF) of structured codes and random codes are analyzed. SCFs of random codes can approach the rate-distortion bound on LSB embedding for any chosen embedding rate. Furthermore, SCFs are modified for applications in ±1 embedding, and a treble layered embedding method for ±2 embedding is obtained. By combining the modified SCFs and the treble layered method, a near-optimal scheme for ±2 embedding is presented. © 2006 IEEE.

Therefore, an approach to matching capabilities towards tasks, which is the key to the mapping, is put forward. The structure of the measures of requirements of an equipment system is studied. Requirements are expressed as task needs, capability needs and capability gap. Capability needs and task needs are related with system function and operational activity. Accordingly the process is divided into four phases to get them. Included are operational task analysis, function and activity analysis, operational capability analysis and capability gap analysis. In order to help communicate requirements clearly, the necessary models in every phase are provided. Finally, an example about an air interdiction operation is presented for specifying the relations among the phases and the objects of every phase.

The limitation of sensor nodes energy necessitates that energy saving is a key issue in WSN. This paper proposes a novel cluster-based data fusion algorithm for WSN. It divides network into grids, and selects one cluster-head from each grid by considering residual energy of nodes, afterward, each non-cluster-head node selects its cluster-head basing on the signal strength of advertisements sent by cluster-heads to form clusters, finally, every cluster-head fuses the data received from its member nodes and transmits the fused data to base station. This algorithm conduces to uniform cluster-heads distribution and rational cluster formation, consequently, achieves better performance on both energy efficiency and lifetime of WSN. © 2010 IEEE.

But the features of data stream (dynamic, infinity, bursty, etc) and complexity of multidimensional data structure, are confronted with great challenges, such as storage space, updating efficiency, adaptability, and so on. In many applications, users often focus on only a portion of views. A computing method based on interesting view subset is proposed in this paper. Interesting view subset and interesting path can be obtained by the information of historical queries. And if the efficiency of answering queries decreases, it should be updated with the lapse of time. The Stream-Tree structure is defined for maintaining the cells of interesting view subset and drilling paths in memory. In the running phase, the cells of Stream-Tree are continuously updated with new tuple arriving, and the old cells are deleted periodically according to the constraints of multi-level time windows. The sparse cells of Stream-Tree will not be divided into finer ones, only the high level aggregations are preserved. Experiments and analysis results indicate that the method is efficient in maintaining the stream cube cells of current time window in finite memory, and can answer the queries of users quickly.

84861144107	Improving various reversible data hiding schemes via optimal codes for binary covers	In reversible data hiding (RDH), the original cover can be losslessly restored after the embedded information is extracted. Kalker and Willems established a rate-distortion model for RDH, in which they proved out the rate-distortion bound and proposed a recursive code construction. In our previous paper, we improved the recursive construction to approach the rate-distortion bound. In this paper, we generalize the method in our previous paper using a decompression algorithm as the coding scheme for embedding data and prove that the generalized codes can reach the rate-distortion bound as long as the compression algorithm reaches entropy. By the proposed binary codes, we improve three RDH schemes that use binary feature sequence as covers, i.e., an RS scheme for spatial images, one scheme for JPEG images, and a pattern substitution scheme for binary images. The experimental results show that the novel codes can significantly reduce the embedding distortion. Furthermore, by modifying the histogram shift (HS) manner, we also apply this coding method to one scheme that uses HS, showing that the proposed codes can be also exploited to improve integer-operation-based schemes. © 2012 IEEE.

Compared with the original matrix embedding, the proposed method can exponentially reduce the computational complexity for equal increment of embedding efficiency. Experimental results also show that this novel method achieves higher embedding efficiency and faster embedding speed than previous fast matrix embedding methods, and thus is more suitable for real-time steganogaphic systems. © 2011 IEEE.

Our algorithm not only improves compression efficiency but also adopts unequal protection strategy, thus improving watermark's robustness considerably. Furthermore, by making full use of dependency among neighbouring macroblocks, an adaptive watermarking algorithm based on motion vectors is proposed to effectively control motion vector's modification and guarantee video quality after watermarking. Experiments demonstrate that this algorithm not only keeps a small PSNR loss and satisfactory visual quality, but also shows resistance against frame-deletion attack.

84863354224	Energy efficient and balanced cluster-based data aggregation algorithm for wireless sensor networks	Data aggregation is an effectual approach for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to save energy and prolong network lifetime. Cluster-based data aggregation algorithms are most popular because they have the advantages of high flexibility and reliability. But the problem of unbalanced energy dissipation is the inherent disadvantage in clusterbased WSNs. This paper addresses this problem in cluster-based and homogeneous WSNs in which cluster heads transmit data to base station by one-hop communication, and proposes an energy efficient and balanced cluster-based data aggregation algorithm (EEBCDA). It divides the network into rectangular grids with unequal size and makes cluster heads rotate among the nodes in each grid respectively, the grid whose cluster head consumes more energy has more sensor nodes to take part in cluster head rotation and share energy load, by this way, it is able to balance energy dissipation. Besides, it adopts some measures to save energy. The results of simulation show that EEBCDA can remarkably enhance energy efficiency, balance energy dissipation and prolong network lifetime. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84864883311	Theory and network applications of balanced Kautz tree structures	In order to improve scalability and to reduce the maintenance overhead for structured peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, researchers have proposed architectures based on several interconnection networks with a fixeddegree and a logarithmical diameter. Among existing fixed-degree interconnection networks, the Kautz digraph hasmany distinctive topological properties compared to others. It, however, requires that the number of peers have the some given values, determined by peer degree and network diameter. In practice, we cannot guarantee how many peers will join a P2P network at a given time, since a P2P network is typically dynamic with peers frequently entering and leaving. To address such an issue, we propose the balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring structures. We further design a novel structured P2P system, called BAKE, based on the two structures that has the logarithmical diameter and constant degree, even the number of peers is an arbitrary value. By keeping a total ordering of peers and employing a robust locality-preserved resource placement strategy, resources that are similar in a single or multidimensional attributes space are stored on the same peer or neighboring peers. Through analysis and simulation, we show that BAKE achieves the optimal diameter and as good a connectivity as the Kautz digraph does (almost achieves the Moore bound), and supports the exact as well as the range queries efficiently. Indeed, the structures of balanced Kautz tree and Kautz ring we propose can also be applied to other interconnection networks after minimal modifications, for example, the de Bruijn digraph. © 2012 ACM.

84865350259	Detection and extraction method for plaintext sequential LSB steganography	By using the statistical properties of the top bits of plaintext, a detection and extraction method for the plaintext sequential least significant bit(LSB) steganography is proposed. The LSBs of the image is obtained by sequentially scanning, and 8 sequences are gained with every bit of the first byte as the beginning and 7 sampling interval. The appropriate window length and the threshold R are chosen, the 8 sequences with the window are sectioned and advantage values of the window are calculated. If one of advantage values is greater than R, the image is judged to be a stego image. After the biggest advantage sequence is found out from 8 sequences, the beginning and the end of the secret message are estimated and the plaintext is recovered. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method is effective. When only 200 bytes English plaintext is embedded in an image, the proposed method can detect and extract the plaintext successfully.

A detailed study of COG analysis of SoS has been carried out by using multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBN) method. The MEBN can be converted into different domain specific Bayesian networks according to different inputs, which is very useful to tackle with the uncertain behaviors of SoS. Then the COG can be measured with Bayesian network inference. In the experiment, we build a COG analysis model of an alert SoS, which considers the repair and backup behaviors of radar system under attack. Degradations of COG are analyzed in the case study, which reflect the effectiveness of different inputs (attack strategies). The results show that degradations are different according to different attack strategies, which support generations of attack plans. This analysis model can help the commander to make the more effective decisions in future warfare.

84872168988	Accurate model for computing parameters of gas-liquid slug flow in horizontal pipe	The paper analyzes the flow mechanism, shape characteristics and inner velocity distribution of gas-liquid slug flow in a horizontal pipe, and develops a physical model for the horizontal pipe. In a steady slug unit, lift velocity is always equal to shedding velocity, so the slug can keep an established shape. The model divides the slug into two parts: liquid-slug and film/bubble zone. For the liquid-slug zone, mass conservation and momentum conservation equations are built up to compute the local liquid-holdup and pressure-drop. For the film area, the model takes film height variation into consideration, assuming the height is only varying along the flow direction but not in the radial direction. The paper deduces a film height variation expression by building local control equations, and then develops a film height via liquid-holdup function and a film height via wet-diameter function. By comparing with test data and some other models, this model presents more accurate prediction results of liquid-holdup and pressure-drop. © All Rights Reserved.

84873208981	Adaptive video error concealment using reversible data hiding	Video transmission in error-prone networks suffers bit errors and packet losses that degrade the decoded video quality. In this paper, a video error concealment scheme based on H.264/AVC is proposed to enhance the error robustness using reversible data hiding. At the encoder, motion vectors of macroblocks belonging to the region of interest (ROI) are embedded into the background region within the same frame. The histogram modification technique based on quantized DCT coefficients of coded macroblocks is used to achieve lossless recovery after data extraction. If a macroblock in the ROI is found missing at the decoder, the embedded motion vector can be extracted from the corresponding host macroblock for the recovery of the missing macroblock. This proposed scheme makes a tradeoff between error concealment performance and compression efficiency. Experimental results show the better reconstructed video quality can be achieved compared with the related error concealment methods. © 2012 IEEE.

84872918942	Energy dissipation balanced and reliable clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks	A novel clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks was proposed to resolve the hot spot problem and the single failure problem. The algorithm divided the network into unequal grids, and the nodes in the same grid form a cluster. The number of cluster heads in each grid was determined according to the failure probability of nodes, and the data collection of nodes in a grid was implemented by multiple cluster heads of the grid cooperatively. By adjusting the number of nodes that could participate in cluster head rotation of each grid, the algorithm was able to balance the energy dissipation of nodes on a long view. The algorithm reduced the reliance of cluster members to single cluster head by forming cluster with multiple cluster heads. Furthermore, the algorithm adopted some measures to diminish energy consumption. Simulation results show that the algorithm has higher balanced extent of energy dissipation and reliability of data collection, and prolongs the lifetime of network.

84873348209	Discrete opinion dynamics on online social networks	This paper focuses on the dynamics of binary opinions {+1, -1} on online social networks consisting of heterogeneous actors. In our model, actors update their opinions under the interplay of social influence and self- affirmation, which leads to rich dynamical behaviors on online social networks. We find that the opinion leading to the consensus features an advantage of the initially weighted fraction based on actors' strength over the other, instead of the population. For the role of specific actors, the consensus converges towards the opinion that a small fraction of high-strength actors hold, and individual diversity of self-affirmation slows down the ordering process of consensus. These indicate that high-strength actors play an essential role in opinion formation with strong social influence as well as high persistence. Further investigations show that the initial fraction of high-strength actors to dominate the evolution depends on the heterogeneity of the strength distribution, and less high-strength actors are needed in the case of a smaller exponent of power-law distribution of actors' strength. Our study provides deep insights into the role of social influence and self-affirmation on opinion formation on online social networks. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84874027987	A fast privacy-preserving multi-keyword search scheme on cloud data	Nowadays, more and more people outsource their data to cloud servers for great flexibility and economic savings. Due to considerations on security, private data is usually protected by encryption before sending to cloud. How to utilize data efficiently while preserving user's privacy is a new challenge. In this paper, we focus on a efficient multi-keyword search scheme meeting a strict privacy requirement. First, we make a short review of two existing schemes supporting multi-keyword search, the kNN-based MRSE scheme and scheme based on bloom filter. Based on the kNN-based scheme, we propose an improved scheme. Our scheme adopt a product of three sparse matrix pairs instead of the original dense matrix pair to encrypt index, and thus get a significant improvement in efficiency. Then, we combine our improved scheme with bloom filter, and thus gain the ability for index updating. Simulation Experiments show proposed scheme indeed introduces low overhead on computation and storage. © 2012 IEEE.

84874035593	Two-step-ranking secure multi-keyword search over encrypted cloud data	To protect privacy of users, sensitive data need to be encrypted before outsourcing to cloud, which makes effective data retrieval a very tough task. In this paper, we proposed a novel order-preserving encryption(OPE) based ranked search scheme over encrypted cloud data, which uses the encrypted keyword frequency to rank the results and provide accurate results via two-step ranking strategy. The first step coarsely ranks the documents with the measure of coordinate matching, i.e., classifying the documents according to the number of query terms included in each document. In the second step, for each category obtained in the first step, a fine ranking process is executed by adding up the encrypted score. Extensive experiments show that this new method is indeed an advanced solution for secure multi-keyword retrieval. © 2012 IEEE.

84874133809	An energy efficient and balanced clustering data aggregation algorithm for wireless sensor networks	In a wireless sensor network, some sensor nodes will consume their energy at a much higher rate and die much faster if the energy dissipation of nodes is unbalanced. Accordingly, the network will lose its ability prematurely. A novel clustering data aggregation algorithm is proposed to resolve the problem of unbalanced energy dissipation among nodes during data gathering in clustering wireless sensor networks. The algorithm divided the network into rectangular grids with unequal size and made cluster heads rotate among the nodes of each grid respectively in terms of residual energy. A grid whose cluster heads consumed more energy is bigger and has more nodes to take part in the cluster head rotation for sharing energy load. By this way, the algorithm is able to balance the energy dissipation of nodes. In addition, considering that wireless sensor networks are energy-restricted because the nodes are equipped with limited and non-rechargeable energy resources, the algorithm adopted a series of measures to save energy. The results of simulation show that the algorithm is able to achieve better performance in aspects of efficiency of energy usage, lifetime of network and balanced extent of energy dissipation.

84875018020	Reversible data hiding in encrypted images by reserving room before encryption	Recently, more and more attention is paid to reversible data hiding (RDH) in encrypted images, since it maintains the excellent property that the original cover can be losslessly recovered after embedded data is extracted while protecting the image content's confidentiality. All previous methods embed data by reversibly vacating room from the encrypted images, which may be subject to some errors on data extraction and/or image restoration. In this paper, we propose a novel method by reserving room before encryption with a traditional RDH algorithm, and thus it is easy for the data hider to reversibly embed data in the encrypted image. The proposed method can achieve real reversibility, that is, data extraction and image recovery are free of any error. Experiments show that this novel method can embed more than 10 times as large payloads for the same image quality as the previous methods, such as for PSNR=40 dB. © 2013 IEEE.

84876170000	Messy genetic algorithm for optimum solution search of HTN planning	Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning algorithm focuses on searching valid solution using knowledge learning or heuristic mechanism. However, there is little work on the planning optimization, especially on handling the problem in the situation that there is little heuristic knowledge to guide the optimum solution search while many non-optimum solutions exist, or there are significance interactions between the abstract intermediate goals which are not independent. This paper put forward a Messy Genetic Algorithm (MGA) to solve the optimum solution searching of HTN planning in the above situations. Length-variant chromosome is introduced to represent the possible planning solution in form of decomposition tree with dynamic node number. It's proved that new offspring decomposition trees can be returned through exchanging the equivalence subtrees of two parental decomposition trees. Based on this proposition, the crossover operation of MGA can be successfully performed. Simulation results indicate that the MGA can locate the optimum solution among the huge search space with about 3×2

84878510569	Recursive histogram modification: Establishing equivalency between reversible data hiding and lossless data compression	State-of-the-art schemes for reversible data hiding (RDH) usually consist of two steps: first construct a host sequence with a sharp histogram via prediction errors, and then embed messages by modifying the histogram with methods, such as difference expansion and histogram shift. In this paper, we focus on the second stage, and propose a histogram modification method for RDH, which embeds the message by recursively utilizing the decompression and compression processes of an entropy coder. We prove that, for independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) gray-scale host signals, the proposed method asymptotically approaches the rate-distortion bound of RDH as long as perfect compression can be realized, i.e., the entropy coder can approach entropy. Therefore, this method establishes the equivalency between reversible data hiding and lossless data compression. Experiments show that this coding method can be used to improve the performance of previous RDH schemes and the improvements are more significant for larger images. © 1992-2012 IEEE.

84878656390	A novel reversible data hiding scheme based on two-dimensional difference-histogram modification	In this paper, based on two-dimensional difference- histogram modification, a novel reversible data hiding (RDH) scheme is proposed by using difference-pair-mapping (DPM). First, by considering each pixel-pair and its context, a sequence consisting of pairs of difference values is computed. Then, a two-dimensional difference-histogram is generated by counting the frequency of the resulting difference-pairs. Finally, reversible data embedding is implemented according to a specifically designed DPM. Here, the DPM is an injective mapping defined on difference-pairs. It is a natural extension of expansion embedding and shifting techniques used in current histogram-based RDH methods. By the proposed approach, compared with the conventional one-dimensional difference-histogram and one-dimensional prediction-error- histogram-based RDH methods, the image redundancy can be better exploited and an improved embedding performance is achieved. Moreover, a pixel-pair-selection strategy is also adopted to priorly use the pixel-pairs located in smooth image regions to embed data. This can further enhance the embedding performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms some state-of-the-art RDH works. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

This paper investigates the task assignment problem, where the value of the targets is time changing in the battlefield, and presents a solution approach that is a combination of two algorithms: the multidestination route planning algorithm based on dynamic programming and the multisubgroup ant colony algorithm (MSACO). The two algorithms coordinately solve the task assignment problem. The route planning algorithm can obtain available routes between any two targets and provide reasonable routing information for MSACO. Then, the ant colony algorithm is applied to solve the task assignment problem. To solve the task assignment problem in the battlefield environment, several key technologies are introduced to improve the traditional ant colony algorithm, which include the subgroup selection strategy, the dynamic candidate aggregate policy, the state transferring policy, and the information-element updating mechanism. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can produce a reasonable and available plan for all the test cases in short computational time. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

84880868167	Reversibility improved data hiding in encrypted images	A novel reversible data hiding technique in encrypted images is presented in this paper. Instead of embedding data in encrypted images directly, some pixels are estimated before encryption so that additional data can be embedded in the estimating errors. A benchmark encryption algorithm (e.g. AES) is applied to the rest pixels of the image and a special encryption scheme is designed to encrypt the estimating errors. Without the encryption key, one cannot get access to the original image. However, provided with the data hiding key only, he can embed in or extract from the encrypted image additional data without knowledge about the original image. Moreover, the data extraction and image recovery are free of errors for all images. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method, especially in aspect of embedding rate versus Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

This paper proposes a reversible data hiding method on DNA sequences and a fragile watermarking scheme that is based on that method. By using these methods, tampered area(s) in a DNA sequence can easily be localized. Even further, if the tampering rate is low, the original sequence can be exactly retrieved. Then by sending the retrieved sequence back, the tampered database will be restored. Our method can be applied to an online database.

84903555989	Towards optimal noise distribution for privacy preserving in data aggregation	In aggregation applications, individual privacy is a crucial factor to determine the effectiveness, for which the noise-addition method (i.e., a random noise value is added to the true value) is a simple yet powerful approach. However, improper additive noise could result in bias for the aggregate result. It demands an optimal noise distribution to reduce the deviation. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework to derive the optimal noise distribution that provides privacy protection under the constraint of a limited value deviation. Specifically, we first derive a generic system dynamic function that the optimal noise distribution must satisfy, and further investigate the special case that the original values obey Gaussian distribution. Then we detailedly investigate the general cases that the original values obey arbitrary continuous distribution, which can be expressed by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our theoretical analysis suggests that for the Gaussian input Gaussian distribution is the optimal solution, and for the general input, the optimal solution is composed of infinite number of Gaussian components. We further find the general term formula of the components, which reduces the number of unknowns from infinite to three, i.e. the parameters of the first component (variance, expectation, weight). Based on it, we investigate the properties and propose an algorithm in order to calculate the asymptotically optimal solution composed of finite Gaussian components. The numerical evaluation shows that the results has little deviation to the optimal solutions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After deriving rate-distortion function for this model, we propose a code construction that can approach the rate-distortion bound. Based on the code construction, a reversible data hiding method for JPEG images is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method has a good balance among image quality, filesize increment and computation time. The excellent performance of proposed method also demonstrate the power of our code construction for reversible data hiding on DCT based media. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84905375317	Key potential-oriented criticality analysis for complex military organization based on FINC-E model	The complex social organizations, which can self-organize into the region "at the edge of chaos", neither too ordered nor too random, now have become an interdisciplinary research topic. As a kind of special social organization, the complex military organization usually has its key entities and relations, which should be well protected in case of attacks. In order to do the criticality analysis for the military organization, finding the key entities or relations which can disrupt the functions of the organization, two problems should be seriously considered. First, the military organization should be well modeled, which can work well in the specialized military context; secondly it is critical to define and identify the key entities or relations, which should incorporate the topological centrality and weighted nodes or edges. Different from the traditional military organizations which are usually task-oriented, this paper proposes the Force, Intelligence, Networking, and C2 Extended (FINC-E) Model for complex military organization, with which a more detailed and quantitative analysis for the military organization is available. This model provides the formal representation for the nodes and edges in the military organization, which provides a highly efficient and concise network topology. In order to identify the critical nodes and edges, a method based on key potential is proposed, which acts as the measurement of criticality for the heterogeneous nodes and edges in the complex military organization. The key potential is well defined on the basis of topology structure and of the node's or edge's capability, which helps to transform the organization from the heterogeneity to the homogeneity. In the end, the criticality analysis case study is made for both small-world networked military organization and scale-free networked military organization, showing that the measure of key potential has the advantage over other classical measures in locating the key entities or relations for complex military organization. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84906720082	Defining embedding distortion for motion vector-based video steganography	This paper presents an effective methodology for motion vector-based video steganography. The main principle is to design a suitable distortion function expressing the embedding impact on motion vectors by exploiting the spatial-temporal correlation based on the framework of minimal-distortion steganography. Two factors are considered in the proposed distortion function, which are the statistical distribution change (SDC) of motion vectors in spatial-temporal domain and the prediction error change (PEC) caused by modifying the motion vectors. The practical embedding algorithm is implemented using syndrome-trellis codes (STCs). Experimental results show that the proposed method can enhance the security performance significantly compared with other existing motion vector-based video steganographic approaches, while obtaining the higher video coding quality as well. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

12344283966	Grid resource discovery scheme based on resource classification	A decentralized grid resource discovery scheme based on resource classification is studied, in which information nodes with the same type of registered resources are organized into communities, and a DHT based bootstrap network is constructed to navigate between different communities efficiently. Periodical topology maintenance communications in bootstrap network are used to piggyback and disseminate popular data in bootstrap network to achieve better load balance. A greedy search based resource location method is also introduced to identify qualified resource providers with good qualities inside communities, which improves scheduling efficiency. The performance improvement is evaluated by simulation under different cases, and overhead is also studied.

84921628222	Optimizing pixel predictors based on self-similarities for reversible data hiding	This paper presents a clustering and optimizing pixel prediction method for reversible data hiding, which exploits self-similarities and group structural information of image patches. Pixel predictors plays an important role for current prediction-error expansion (PEE) based reversible data hiding schemes. Instead of using a fixed or a content-adaptive predictor for each pixel independently, we first employ pixel clustering according to the structural similarities of image patches, and then for all the pixels assigned to each cluster, an optimized pixel predictor is estimated from the group context. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-art counterparts such as the simple rhombus neighborhood, the median edge detector, and the gradient-adjusted predictor et al.

84923865965	Reversible data hiding for DNA sequences and its applications	As the blueprint of vital activities of most living things on earth, DNA has important status and must be protected perfectly. And in current DNA databases, each sequence is stored with several notes that help to describe that sequence. However, these notes have no contribution to the protection of sequences. In this paper, the authors propose a reversible data hiding method for DNA sequences, which could be used either to embed sequence-related annotations, or to detect and restore tampers. When embedding sequence annotations, the methods works in low embedding rate mode. Only several bits of annotations are embedded. When used for tamper detection and tamper restoration, all possible embedding positions are utilized to assure the maximum restoration capacity.
