16644394222	High efficient STDMSD rate control method	At low bit rate, most computation in Tier-1 of JPEG2000 is redundant. A novel Slope Threshold Descending with Minimal Slope Discarding (STDMSD) rate control method is proposed to alleviate this problem. In this algorithm, by initially setting a larger threshold of rate-distortion slope and marking the channels that their rate-distortion slopes are larger than the thresholds in each coding block as selected state, and then decreasing the threshold step by step until the sum of the rate of those selection exceeds the predefined rate limitation, an approximate optimal truncation point will be obtained. Then, the minimal slope discarding method is applied to obtain the optimal truncation point and the rate control is realized. The proposed method can effectively reduce the computation of Tier-1 up to 84.5% and cause only 0.094 dB PSNR loss for the reconstructed image in the case of 0.25 bpp bit rate.

1942507521	Discussion of nonlinear local optimization methods for EEG inverse problem solution	The EEG inverse problem solution is an important issue in EEG research. Nonlinear local optimization methods, such as Simplex and Levenberg-Marquart algorithms, were used to solve EEG dipole source localization problems. The relationship between localizing errors and noise level was discussed on the condition that the source number was known. If the source number was unknown, the selected number in model might not equal to the actual one, then a computation was carried out and a corresponding discrimination criteria was proposed. Approximation accuracy between the simulation measurements and dipole-generated potentials was given. The computation speed and the localizing results between the two algorithms were compared. Computer simulation demonstrates that nonlinear local optimization methods are effective for EEG inverse solution if the source number is one or two and the initial iterative values are reasonable.

20044367864	Estimation of electrical conductivity distribution within the human head from magnetic flux density measurement	We have developed a new algorithm for magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), which uses only one component of the magnetic flux density to reconstruct the electrical conductivity distribution within the body. The radial basis function (RBF) network and simplex method are used in the present approach to estimate the conductivity distribution by minimizing the errors between the 'measured' and model-predicted magnetic flux densities. Computer simulations were conducted in a realistic-geometry head model to test the feasibility of the proposed approach. Single-variable and three-variable simulations were performed to estimate the brain-skull conductivity ratio and the conductivity values of the brain, skull and scalp layers. When SNR = 15 for magnetic flux density measurements with the target skull-to-brain conductivity ratio being 1/15, the relative error (RE) between the target and estimated conductivity was 0.0737 ± 0.0746 in the single-variable simulations. In the three-variable simulations, the RE was 0.1676 ± 0.0317. Effects of electrode position uncertainty were also assessed by computer simulations. The present promising results suggest the feasibility of estimating important conductivity values within the head from noninvasive magnetic flux density measurements. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

19144363976	Use of 3-D magnetic resonance electrical impedance tomography in detecting human cerebral stroke: A simulation study	We have developed a new three dimensional (3-D) conductivity imaging approach and have used it to detect human brain conductivity changes corresponding to acute cerebral stroke. The proposed Magnetic Resonance Electrical Impedance Tomography (MREIT) approach is based on the J-Substitution algorithm and is expanded to imaging 3-D subject conductivity distribution changes. Computer simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the present MREIT imaging approach. Simulations of both types of cerebral stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke, were performed on a four-sphere head model. Simulation results showed that the correlation coefficient (CC) and relative error (RE) between target and estimated conductivity distributions were 0.9245 ± 0.0068 and 8.9997% ± 0.0084%, for hemorrhagic stroke, and 0.6748 ± 0.0197 and 8.8986% ± 0.0089%, for ischemic stroke, when the SNR (signal-to-noise radio) of added GWN (Gaussian White Noise) was 40. The convergence characteristic was also evaluated according to the changes of CC and RE with different iteration numbers. The CC increases and RE decreases monotonously with the increasing number of iterations. The present simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed 3-D MREIT approach in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke detection and suggest that the method may become a useful alternative in clinical diagnosis of acute cerebral stroke in humans.

29144520327	Particle filter tracking algorithm based on maximum a posteriori	The weakness of Kalman filter is that it is inadequate to solve the problem of non-linear and non-Gaussian model. A new model with importance weights, density assisted particle filter algorithm is proposed. This method represents the distribution of the states by weighted samples and iterates the change of states. The virtue of this algorithm is that it can adapt complex interactions with overlap and ambiguities and track to multiple objects simultaneously. Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) mode is exploited the statistical dependence between objects to provide accurate decisions and state estimation. Analysis of resample techniques reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm to noises. Weight correspondence to sample should be arranged in a distribution around the most possible area of object.

Firstly, the whole image is encoded to measure whether the reconstructed ROI PSNR is higher than the target. If it is true, it means that the estimated ROI PSNR is higher than the target and there is no need to go on to encode the ROI and the background (BG) separately; otherwise the ROI is encoded until the estimated ROI PSNR is higher than the target and then the BG is encoded. ISA-DWT is adopted to transform the arbitrary shape visual object. The well-known set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is modified to generate the compression bit streams. The proposed method has several novelties: 1) it ensures the PSNR of the ROI at first to overcome the unbalance of the ROI and the BG; 2) it does not import redundant wavelet coefficients like the lifting method; 3) it is fit for arbitrary shape ROI coding; 4) it achieves low complexity by reaching the target ROI PSNR. © 2005 IEEE.

We propose a new algorithm, Super Particle Filter(SPF), which adds hyper parameters in state vector and estimates state and parameters simultaneously online. By the method, hype parameters can be adjusted to change with model automatically. The introduction of hyper parameters to state vector makes state space model nonlinear. For the reason, Particle Filter is applied to solve the nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space models. We compared this algorithm to the EKF algorithm. Experimental results show SPF algorithm increase 60% in accurate and 70% in time expenditure. © 2006 IEEE.

34047211925	Image denoising based on wavelet domain spatial context modeling	Using prior knowledge about the spatial clustering of the wavelet coefficients, a new image denoising method that applies the Bayesian framework is proposed. Wavelet coefficients of image are characterized by a two-state Gaussian mixture model (GMM), while their local spatial interactions are modeled by a Markov random field (MRF) model. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the GMM, and an iterative updating technique known as iterative conditional modes (ICM) is applied to optimize the binary labels containing the positions of those wavelet coefficients that represent the useful signal in each subband. For each wavelet coefficient a shrinkage factor is finally determined, depending on its initial shrinkage factor and on the local spatial neighborhood in the label field. The qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that the new scheme outperforms other wavelet denosing methods, such as yielding significantly superior image quality, increasing peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). © 2006 IEEE.

35348893116	Solving the EEG forward problems in a realistic geometry head model by means of the finite difference method	There are two important problems in the field of Electroencephalogram (EEG); EEG forward problem and inverse problem. The EEG forward problem is an important component of the EEG inverse problem. In realistic geometry head models, EEG source analysis depends on the accuracy and the efficiency of the numerical method chosen for solving the Forward Problem, as there is no analytical solution for realistic geometry models. A finite difference method (FDM) has been implemented to solve the 3-dimensional isotropic EEG forward problem. Then, the effects of dipole eccentricity, spacing of finite difference elements and number of grid nodes on the solution accuracy and efficiency are discussed by comparing the FDM numerical solutions with the analytic solutions on a three-concentric-sphere model. Finally, the FDM has been applied to a realistic-shaped head model to solve the EEG forward problem. The present computer simulation results suggest that FDM is convenient to solve the potential distribution in irregular shaped objects, and provides an effective tool for the EEG forward problem in realistic geometry head models.

57949107597	Face recognition based on discriminant vector angle embedding	A discriminant vector angle embedding (DVAE) method was presented for dimension reduction based face recognition by constructing neighborhood graphs. A graph including both positive edges and negative edges is constructed. A positive edge is put on two samples in the same class and a negative edge on two different class samples within k nearest neighbor. The measure in DVAE is the angle between two vectors instead of modulus in traditional methods, which not only exempts the estimation of the parameter t in heat weight function, but also reduces the influence of luminance difference between image samples on face recognition. When a test sample is embedded into the low-dimensional space with preserving the neighborhood vector angle, a classification called angle nearest neighbor is used for face recognition. Experiments on Yale and UMIST databases demonstrated that the proposed approach is superior to other methods in terms of recognition accuracy.

MREIT, motivated to deal with the well-known ill-posed problem in the traditional EIT, has been applied to reconstruct the conductivities of human head tissues with higher accuracy and spatial resolution. This paper reviews the works of our MREIT research group in the past several years. We have developed several algorithms on imaging of head tissues including scalp, skull, brain (CSF, gray matter, white matter) with homogeneous and inhomogeneous conductivity distributions. We used RBF-MREIT, RSM-MREIT and ANFIS-MREIT algorithms to estimate the head tissue conductivities including anisotropic white matter characteristics. Furthermore, we have utilized the Two-Step MREIT algorithm and the 3-D algebraic reconstruction algorithm based on two components of the magnetic flux density to estimate inhomogeneous conductivities of human head. Simulation studies on the concentric three-spheres and realistic geometry head model demonstrated that the proposed algorithms could reconstruct the homogeneous and inhomogeneous human head tissue conductivity distributions with high resolution.

53549085145	A new method to derive white matter conductivity from diffusion tensor MRI	We propose a new algorithm to derive the anisotropic conductivity of the cerebral white matter (WM) from the diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data. The transportation processes for both water molecules and electrical charges are described through a common multicompartment model that consists of axons, glia, or the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The volume fraction (VF) of each compartment varies from voxel to voxel and is estimated from the measured diffusion tensor. The conductivity tensor at each voxel is then computed from the estimated VF values and the decomposed eigenvectors of the diffusion tensor. The proposed VF algorithm was applied to the DT-MRI data acquired from two healthy human subjects. The extracted anisotropic conductivity distribution was compared with those obtained by using two existing algorithms, which were based upon a linear conductivity-to-diffusivity relationship and a volume constraint, respectively. The present results suggest that the VF algorithm is capable of incorporating the partial volume effects of the CSF and the intravoxel fiber crossing structure, both of which are not addressed altogether by existing algorithms. Therefore, it holds potential to provide a more accurate estimate of the WM anisotropic conductivity, and may have important applications to neuroscience research or clinical applications in neurology and neurophysiology. © 2006 IEEE.

Moment simulation results showed that the rotation model of wing affected the rotational moment very much, but affected the stroke moment very little, and the amplitude of the attack angle affected both the rotational and stroke moment very much, except the rotational moment in the advanced model. Comparison between the proposed simulation results and the experimental results of relative articles was put forward to check the validity. The result showed that the figures were quite similar to each other, and both the positions and amplitudes of corresponding key points matched very well.

67649892578	Solving the forward problem of magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction by means of the finite element method	Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a recently proposed imaging modality to image the electrical impedance of biological tissue. It combines the good contrast of electrical impedance tomography with the high spatial resolution of sonography. In this paper, a three-dimensional MAT-MI forward problem was investigated using the finite element method (FEM). The corresponding FEM formulae describing the forward problem are introduced. In the finite element analysis, magnetic induction in an object with conductivity values close to biological tissues was first carried out. The stimulating magnetic field was simulated as that generated from a three-dimensional coil. The corresponding acoustic source and field were then simulated. Computer simulation studies were conducted using both concentric and eccentric spherical conductivity models with different geometric specifications. In addition, the grid size for finite element analysis was evaluated for the model calibration and evaluation of the corresponding acoustic field. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

A new method was proposed for getting these parameters from the view of electrochemistry based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using Stokes-Einstein and Nernst-Einstein equations. The method was tested on DTI data of a human subject, and the result was compared to the experiential conductivity of different brain tissues (white matter, grey matter, CSF). It was showed that the more anisotropic the tissue was, the further the conductivity tensor eigenvalue of it deviated, illuminating the necessary of including anisotropic conductivity in EEG/MEG. This method was based on DTI data incorporating the factor of the concentration of the ions in brain liquid, and provided an effective approach of calculating anisotropic conductivity of brain tissue.

70449360811	Supervised vector angle embedding learning for face recognition	Based on constructing neighborhood graphs, a method called supervised vector angle embedding (SVAE) was presented for face recognition. A graph including both positive edges and negative edges was constructed. It put a positive edge on two samples in the same class and a negative edge on two different class samples within k nearest neighbor each other. The measure in SVAE was the angle between two vectors instead of modulus in traditional methods. It does not require the estimation of the parameter in heat weight function, and can reduce the influence of luminance on face recognition. When test sample was embedded into low-dimensional space with preserving neighborhood vector angle, a classification called angle nearest neighbor was used for face recognition. Experiments on Yale and UMIST databases demonstrated the proposed approach was superior to other methods in terms of recognition accuracy. © 2009 IEEE.

A high-field MRI system is accompanied by significant wave propagation effects, and the radio frequency (RF) radiation is dependent on EPs of the biological tissue. Based on the measurement of the active transverse magnetic component of the applied RF field (known as B1-mapping technique), we have developed a dual-excitation algorithm, which uses two sets of measured B1 data, to noninvasively reconstruct the biological tissue's electric properties. A series of computer simulations were conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed method on a 3-D head model within a birdcage coil and a transverse electromagnetic coil. Compared with other B1-mapping based reconstruction algorithms, our approach provides superior performance without the need for iterative computations.

77952642033	Simulation of MCG problem by using meshless finite element method	The magnetic field outside produced by the current dipole within a volume conductor of an arbitrary geometry was calculated by using a meshless finite element method (FEM) and Bio-Savart law. In order to take the advantage of Bio-Savart law, the current density within the whole medium has to be calculated first. According to the boundary conditions, the meshless FEM was used to calculate the potential at each node. The current density was achieved by the gradient of potential. The components of the induced field were realized by the integral of current density. The algorithm was evaluated on a single-layer homogeneous sphere model with a satisfactory result achieved. This algorithm was also used on the heart-torso model from magnetic resonance imaging of a healthy person for the latent application on the analysis of magnetocardiogram (MCG) and magnetoencephalogram(MEG).

79951495200	Effects of white matter anisotropic and inhomogeneous conductivity on EEG forward solutions	The anisotropic and inhomogeneous distribution of brain white matter(MW) conductivity is widespread, so the measure of its impact on forward problem of EEG is very important. But the existing simulation methods neglected the anisotropy and inhomogenity. First white matter was divided into four categories respectively , and the impact on EEG problems was discussed. From the result of the simulation, we thought that the conductivity bias values on the heterogeneity was the most important factor, while ignoring white matter conductivity heterogeneity would cause about 10% of the calculation error about EEG forward problem. So the impact of conductivity inhomogenity could not be ignored, the inhomogeneous and anisotropic WM conductivity model need to be constructed.

79952917253	Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) for breast tumor imaging: Numerical modeling and simulation	Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) was recently introduced as a noninvasive electrical conductivity imaging approach with high spatial resolution close to ultrasound imaging. In this study, we test the feasibility of the MAT-MI method for breast tumor imaging using numerical modeling and computer simulation. Using the finite element method, we have built three-dimensional numerical breast models with varieties of embedded tumors for this simulation study. In order to obtain an accurate and stable forward solution that does not have numerical errors caused by singular MAT-MI acoustic sources at conductivity boundaries, we first derive an integral forward method for calculating MAT-MI acoustic sources over the entire imaging volume. An inverse algorithm for reconstructing the MAT-MI acoustic source is also derived with spherical measurement aperture, which simulates a practical setup for breast imaging. With the numerical breast models, we have conducted computer simulations under different imaging parameter setups and all the results suggest that breast tumors that have large conductivity in contrast to the surrounding tissue as reported in the literature may be readily detected in the reconstructed MAT-MI images. In addition, our simulations also suggest that the sensitivity of imaging breast tumors using the presented MAT-MI setup depends more on the tumor location and the conductivity contrast between the tumor and its surrounding tissue than on the tumor size. © 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

The isotropic conductivity distribution of scalp, skull, cerebrospinal fluid, gray matter and the equivalent isotropic conductivity distribution of white matter were reconstructed by IC-MREIT J-substitution algorithm. The equivalent isotropic conductivity distribution was used as the initial information in order to iteratively reconstruct anisotropic conductivity distribution of the white matter. A realistic head model consisting of five compartments was constructed based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and the model was used to examine the feasibility of the algorithm. With the 0% and 15% noise levels, the relative errors between the target and the reconstructed conductivity distribution were less than 15% and 24%, respectively. The simulation results show that the algorithm is robust to measurement noise and has high accuracy.

84855216407	Added mass effect and an extended unsteady blade element model of insect hovering	During the insect flight, the force peak at the start of each stroke contributes a lot to the total aerodynamic force. Yet how this force is generated is still controversial. Two current explanations to this are wake capture and Added Mass Effect (AME) mechanisms. To study the AME, we present an extended unsteady blade element model which takes both the added mass of fluid and rotational effect of the wing into account. Simulation results show a high force peak at the start of each stroke and are quite similar to the measured forces on the physical wing model. We found that although the Added Mass Force (AMF) of the medium contributes a lot to this force peak, the wake capture effect further augments this force and may play a more important role in delayed mode. Furthermore, we also found that there might be an unknown mechanism which may augment the AME during acceleration period at the start of each stroke, and diminish the AME during deceleration at the end of each stroke. © 2011 Jilin University.

84856138977	Mean shift clustering-based moving object segmentation in the h.264 compressed domain	This study presents a mean shift clustering-based moving object segmentation approach in the H.264 compressed domain. The motion information extracted from H.264 compressed video, including motion vectors (MVs) and partitioned block size, are used as segmentation cues. The MVs are processed by normalisation, weighted 3D median filter and motion compensation to obtain a reliable and salient MV field. The partitioned block size is used as a measure of motion texture in the process of the MV field. Based on the processed MV field, the authors employ the mean shift-based mode seeking in spatial, temporal and range domain to develop a new approach for compact representation of the MV field. Then, the MV field is segmented into different motion-homogenous regions by clustering the modes with small spatial and range distance, and each object is represented by some dominant modes. Experimental results for several H.264 compressed video sequences demonstrate good performance and efficiency of the proposed segmentation approach. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2009.

84870835287	EEG-based motor imagery classification accuracy improves with gradually increased channel number	The question of how many channels should be sed for classification remains a key issue in the study of Brain-Computer Interface. Several studies have shown that a reduced number of channels can achieve the optimal classification accuracy in the offline analysis of motor imagery paradigm, which does not have real-time feedback as in the online control. However, for the cursor movement control paradigm, it remains unclear as to how many channels should be selected in order to achieve the optimal classification. In the present study, we gradually increased the number of channels, and adopted the time-frequency- spatial synthesized method for left and right motor imagery classification. We compared the effect of increasing channel number in two datasets, an imagery-based cursor movement control dataset and a motor imagery tasks dataset. Our results indicated that for the former dataset, the more channels we used, the higher the accuracy rate was achieved, which is in contrast to the finding in the latter dataset that optimal performance was obtained at a subset number of channels. When gradually increasing the number of channels from 2 to all in the analysis of cursor movement control dataset, the average training and testing accuracies from three subjects improved from 68.7% to 90.4% and 63.7% to 87.7%, respectively. © 2012 IEEE.

84893679924	A fast estimation algorithm of community number in large scale-free complex networks	In conventional community detecting algorithms, the community number is always a bypass product and cannot be estimated before partitioning. Since partitioning large scale and dynamic complex networks takes exhausting computation, the community number sometimes can be a terminal condition of iterations or a preset optimal parameter for speeding up partitioning algorithms. This paper assumes that communities are organized around the center of core nodes in a scale-free network. A separability function is built to dichotomize nodes into two classes and the class of large degree nodes is selected as the core node candidate set. An improved shortest path seeking algorithm is applied to remove the closest neighbors of a specific core node. The number of remaining core nodes is then the estimated number of communities. Experiments of real world scale-free networks and computer generated networks show that the results are very close to the well-proven results. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84900263257	Model free data mining	Input selection is a crucial step for nonlinear regression modeling problem, which contributes to build an interpretable model with less computation. Most of the available methods are model-based, and few of them are model-free. Model-based methods often make use of prediction error or sensitivity analysis for input selection and model-free methods exploit consistency. In this chapter, we show the underlying relationship between sensitivity analysis and consistency analysis for input selection, and then derive an efficient model-free method from our common sense, and then formulate this common sense by fuzzy logic, thus it can be called fuzzy consistency analysis (FCA). In contrast to available methods, FCA has the following desirable properties: (1) it is a model-free method so that it will not be biased on a specific model, exploiting "what the data say" rather than "what the model say," which is the essential point of data mining-input selection should not be biased on a specific model, (2) it is implemented as efficiently as classical model-free methods, but more flexible than them, and (3) it can be directly applied to a data set with mix continuous and discrete inputs without doing rotation. Four benchmark problems study indicates that the proposed method works effectively for nonlinear problems. With the input selection procedure, the underlying reasons, which affect the prediction are work out, which helps to gain an insight into a specific problem and servers the purpose of data mining very well. © 2008, IGI Global.

Existing reconstruction algorithms for MAT-MI are based on the assumption that the acoustic properties in the tissue are homogeneous. However, the tissue in most parts of human body has heterogeneous acoustic properties, which leads to potential distortion and blurring of small buried objects in the impedance images. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm for MAT-MI to image the impedance distribution in tissues with inhomogeneous acoustic speed distributions. With a computer head model constructed from MR images of a human subject, a series of numerical simulation experiments were conducted.

84903216370	Assessing dynamic spectral causality by lagged adaptive directed transfer function and instantaneous effect factor	It is of significance to assess the dynamic spectral causality among physiological signals. Several practical estimators adapted from spectral Granger causality have been exploited to track dynamic causality based on the framework of time-varying multivariate autoregressive (tvMVAR) models. The nonzero covariance of the model's residuals has been used to describe the instantaneous effect phenomenon in some causality estimators. However, for the situations with Gaussian residuals in some autoregressive models, it is challenging to distinguish the directed instantaneous causality if the sufficient prior information about the 'causal ordering' is missing. Here, we propose a new algorithm to assess the time-varying causal ordering of tvMVAR model under the assumption that the signals follow the same acyclic causal ordering for all time lags and to estimate the instantaneous effect factor (IEF) value in order to track the dynamic directed instantaneous connectivity. The time-lagged adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF) is also estimated to assess the lagged causality after removing the instantaneous effect. In this study, we first investigated the performance of the causal-ordering estimation algorithm and the accuracy of IEF value. Then, we presented the results of IEF and time-lagged ADTF method by comparing with the conventional ADTF method through simulations of various propagation models. Statistical analysis results suggest that the new algorithm could accurately estimate the causal ordering and give a good estimation of the IEF values in the Gaussian residual conditions. Meanwhile, the time-lagged ADTF approach is also more accurate in estimating the time-lagged dynamic interactions in a complex nervous system after extracting the instantaneous effect. In addition to the simulation studies, we applied the proposed method to estimate the dynamic spectral causality on real visual evoked potential (VEP) data in a human subject. Its usefulness in time-variant spectral causality assessment was demonstrated through the mutual causality investigation of brain activity during the VEP experiments. © 2014 IEEE.

84906082821	Mixed linear model approach for mapping quantitative trait loci underlying crop seed traits	The crop seed is a complex organ that may be composed of the diploid embryo, the triploid endosperm and the diploid maternal tissues. According to the genetic features of seed characters, two genetic models for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of crop seed traits are proposed, with inclusion of maternal effects, embryo or endosperm effects of QTL, environmental effects and QTL-by-environment (QE) interactions. The mapping population can be generated either from double back-cross of immortalized F 2 (IF 2) to the two parents, from random-cross of IF 2 or from selfing of IF 2 population. Candidate marker intervals potentially harboring QTLs are first selected through one-dimensional scanning across the whole genome. The selected candidate marker intervals are then included in the model as cofactors to control background genetic effects on the putative QTL(s). Finally, a QTL full model is constructed and model selection is conducted to eliminate false positive QTLs. The genetic main effects of QTLs, QE interaction effects and the corresponding P-values are computed by Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Gaussian mixed linear model via Gibbs sampling. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the reliability and efficiency of the proposed method. The simulation results showed that the proposed method had higher power to accurately detect simulated QTLs and properly estimated effect of these QTLs. To demonstrate the usefulness, the proposed method was used to identify the QTLs underlying fiber percentage in an upland cotton IF 2 population. A computer software, QTLNetwork-Seed, was developed for QTL analysis of seed traits. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.
