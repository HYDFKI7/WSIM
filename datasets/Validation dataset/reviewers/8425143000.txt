84897898286	Optimization research on low specific speed centrifugal impeller based on incomplete sensitivities method	According to the limitation of the traditional optimization design method for centrifugal impeller, the optimization method for low specific speed centrifugal pump impeller based on incomplete sensitivities is proposed. In this method, the affection of the control parameters perturbation on the flow state variation can be neglected while calculating the gradient of the design objective function with the control variable of the impeller passages shape. So the flow filed only need to be simulated once in one optimization cycle, it avoids the calculation of the flow field repeatedly in finite difference method. It also avoids deducing and solving the adjoint equation in adjoint method. Therefore, the calculation cost is greatly reduced. The calculation case is the low specific speed centrifugal impellers; the two dimensional blade is parameterized by Taylor expansion. The coefficients in the Taylor function are taken as the control variable. The moment acting on the blade are considered as the objective function. Using the incomplete sensitivities method the gradient of the objective function with respect to the control variable can be evaluated easily, and the blade shape can be renewed according to the inverse direction of the gradient vectors. The optimum design of impeller can be achieved while the objective function is minimized. The calculation case results show that the proposed incomplete sensitivities theory for the optimization of low specific speed centrifugal impeller is rational. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84863123210	Influences of guide vanes airfoil on hydraulic turbine runner performance	The 4 different kinds of guide vanes airfoil turbines are used as objects, and under the same dimensions of the turbine wheel (high-pressure side diameter, low-pressure side diameter, and blade width of inlet, outlet placement angle and number of blades) and the same design, numerical simulations were performed for turbines by using software FLUENT 6.3. The experiment shows that the blade pressure surface and suction surface pressure is low when the hydraulic turbine installations were added standard positive curvature of the guide vane and modified positive curvature of guide vane .Therefore, the efficiency of energy recovery is low. However, the pressure of negative curvature guide vane and symmetric guide vane added on hydraulic turbine installations is larger than that of former ones, and it is conducive to working of runner. With the decreasing of guide vane opening, increasing of inlet angle, flow state gets significantly worse and obvious reflux and horizontal flow appeared in blade pressure surface. At the same time, the vortex was formed in Leaf Road, Leading to the loss of energy. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For the given hydraulic performance parameters and a volume fraction of the solid phase at the design point, a smooth, three-dimensional blade profile could be established through the parametric equations. The water performance of a screw centrifugal pump whose blades were designed in that way was measured, and accordingly its performances of liquid-solid two-phase flow were estimated numerically at three volume fractions of 5%, 15% and 25% with a CFD code, respectively. The results show that the pump efficiency for transporting solid-liquid two-phase medium is better than for transporting water. At the design point, for a given volume fraction of solid phase, the pump efficiency is increased by 8.5%; however, when the volume fraction is different from that given value, the pump efficiency is reduced.

84866540190	Parametric design of centrifugal pump impellers	The problems in the optimization design of centrifugal pump impeller were elaborated and it was found that the implicit relation between the hydraulic performance and the complicated geometry shape of impeller passages was a main obstacle. The existing parametric design methods for centrifugal pump impellers, such as the NURBS surface method, free surface deformation method and partial differential equation method were introduced in detail. To reduce the computational cost, a partial differential equations method was used to control the geometry shape of centrifugal impellers parametrically, the boundary conditions of the equations were parameterized as well.Suppose the parameters a(u, v) are constant and the response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the design of centrifugal pump impellers, a 2nd order polynomial response surface was constructed according to the trial results.Unfortunately, it was identified that a 2nd order polynomial fails to present the complicated nonlinear relation between the objective function and the control variables. So the partial differential equations had to be proposed to construct the hypersurface response of objective function. Then a boundary-value problem of hyperspace was numerically solved. Eventually, an optimal design of pump impellers was achieved.The result of the optimized design case shows that the proposed theory and method are reasonable.

Thus in order to predict the axial thrust precisely and to correlate it to the physical property parameters of the medium handled by the pump, the axial thrust in the screw centrifugal pump of type 150×100LN-32 was calculated when it transported a sand water two phase fluid by using CFD code Fluent. The two phase flow in the pump was described by the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in relative coordinate systems and the mixture model. The standard k-ε two equation turbulence model and the SIMPLE algorithm were used in numerical simulations. An axial thrust was calculated after the pressure distributions in the pump were available. In this way, the problems and the difficulty aforementioned can be avoided. The relations of axial thrust to solid volume fraction, particle diameter and flow rate of the two phase flow were explored by using the computational results. The results showed that the axial thrust rises with increasing solid volume fraction, but reduces with increasing flow rate and particle diameter. The conclusion is of great significance for improving the stability of the pump and extending its lifespan.

The experimental results suggest that the large eddy simulation can estimate the positive slope characteristic of head & capacity curve. And the calculation results show that the pressure fluctuation coefficients of the middle section in guide vane inlet will decrease firstly and then increase. In guide vane outlet, the pressure fluctuation coefficients of section will be approximately axially symmetrical distribution. The pressure fluctuation minimum of section in guide vane inlet is above the middle location of the guide vane suction surface, and the pressure fluctuation minimum of section in which located the middle and outlet of guide vane. When it is under the small flow operating condition, the eddy scale of guide vane is larger, and the pressure fluctuation of the channel in guide vane being cyclical fluctuations obviously which leads to the area of eddy expanding to the whole channel from the suction side.

84903482204	New inverse method of centrifugal pump blade and its optimization	According to the deficiency of the traditional centrifugal pump inverse method, the partial differential equation is used to generate the centrifugal pump blade surface, and then the blade design problem is transformed into the boundary-value problem of partial differential equation. According to the blade streamline equation, when the distributions of blade angle on boundary are given, the angular coordinates of dispersed points on pump blade boundary would be calculated. And so the boundary condition of the partial differential equation is determined. The blades geometries can be controlled by adjust the distribution of the blade angle on hub and shroud. A new distribution function is introduced to control the blade angle on hub and shroud. The gradient optimizing technology is also used to find the optimum control parameters in distribution function. The relations between the pump blade model and the pump design parameters are built, so the clipping drawing of the pump impeller is unnecessary when designing the impeller, and the parameterized design of blade is achieved. The calculation case shows that the inverse method of centrifugal pump blade presented here is rational, and it is of great value both in theory and in engineering practice.

84907204607	Dynamic mesh simulation and analysis for inner flow field of cam pump	According to the meshing characteristics of cam pump rotors, the involute profile equation was established to show that when the pressure angle α of profile equation was from 40° to 50°, the conjugate rotors did not produce interference effects during relative motions. To clarify the effects of pressure angle on geometric parameters of cam pump rotor profile equation, based on the dynamic grid model of Fluent software and the grid deformation technique of reconstruction of local grid, the RNG k-ε turbulence model and the PISO algorithm were used to realize dynamic grid numerical analysis of the internal flow field of rotor cavity of the cam pump. Monitoring pulsations of outlet flow and inlet pressure quantitatively, the transient characteristics of flow pulsation and pressure pulsation were achieved under the conditions of different pressure angles and flow. The simulation results show that the outlet flow and the inlet pressure of cam pump present periodic fluctuations. As the pressure angle of cam pump rotors increases gradually, both the outlet flow and the inlet pressure show reduction tendency. The rotational speed is the main impacting factor on the period of fluctuations and the pulsation phenomenon. With the increase of rotational speed, the outlet flow and the inlet pressure increase significantly, and the phenomenon of pulsation is more obvious. When the rotational speed increases to a certain degree, the inlet pressure and the outlet speed increase slightly, and the pulsation phenomenon is more severe.

84907873358	Energy loss analysis of impeller flow of screw centrifugal pump	The flow regime in screw centrifugal pump was simulated by the method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which can acquire the distribution of the pressure and relative velocity on the work side and back side of blade. The Rothalpy value along the streamlines of blade was used as a quantitative index of energy loss. The energy loss within the impeller field was analyzed from the perspective of energy loss when the transmission medium is pure water and solid-liquid two phase flow, in which the concentration of sand is 20% and the diameter of sand is 0.076 mm. The result shows that the front of impeller is a transition region of energy conversion, the screw part is the main region of energy increase, and the friction loss at the middle of screw part has an effect on the working capacity of screw part. Compared with pure water transmission medium, the working capacity of the impeller shows some improvement when the transmission medium is the solid-liquid two phase flow. And the energy of the two kind transmission media tends to become average at the outlet of impeller.

84921514348	Numerical analysis for effects of different blade tip clearance on performance in mixed-flow pump	The mixed-flow pump has some good characteristics, such as high efficiency, good start performance, and wide working condition. The traditional design methods of mixed-flow pumps cannot evaluate the sensitivity of the tip clearance's impact on pump performance quantificationally. In order to reveal the tip clearance effect on the internal flow field and the performance of mixed-flow pump, and given the selection range of blade tip clearance, four mixed-flow pumps with different tip clearance values, 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mm, respectively, were studied. The distorted triangle method was adopted to design the impeller and guide vane, and based on the software ICEM CFD to generate block hexahedron structured grids of the computational domain, and then the topological structure of the grids of the blade tip region was optimized. The internal flow field of the pumps was simulated based on the SST k-ω turbulence model and SIMPLEC algorithm, using the structured grid technology mentioned above, and the numerical simulation results were compared with the test experimental data, which agreed well with each other. The results show that the value of tip clearance have a significant effect on mixed-flow pump hydraulic performance, when tip clearance was 0.5 mm. The head-flow positive slope characteristic of the pump can be suppressed effectively, and the efficiency value of mixed-flow pump is highest at this time; when tip clearance was 0, the pump head-flow positive slope characteristic is relatively obvious; when tip clearance was 1mm, simulation values and experimental values matched well, so the SST k-ω model can simulate the flow characteristics of tip clearance of mixed-flow pumps well, so that the results of the performance prediction have some credibility. Under small flow conditions, small tip clearance values can restrain unstable positive slope features of mixed-flow pump. When tip clearance was 0.5mm, the performance of the pump with small tip clearance is the best. With the increasing of tip clearance value, tip leakage flow became outstanding gradually, the axis plane flow velocity of the near wall region of the impeller outlet and the vorticity change significantly, which indicates that tip clearance affects the axis plane velocity distributions of the impeller and the load distributions of the blades directly. As influenced by the frictional resistance and the viscous resistance of the wall, the impeller axis plane flow velocity of the impeller hub region and tip clearances areas is relatively small. When tip clearance increase, blades load of the impeller hub region and tip clearances areas decay rapidly, and it affects the performance ability of impeller blades. At the same time, serious mix permeability and entrainment effects come into being between the leakage flow near the blade tip and the main stream flow, and cause the significant decline in the axis plane flow velocity in the region near the blade tip of impeller outlet. At the moment, the jet effect of the tip leakage flow decays gradually, and the sphere of influence gradually extends to the entire blade tip region.
