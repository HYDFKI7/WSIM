33746649103	Carbon-supported Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles for oxygen reduction reaction	The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on carbon-supported Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles has been investigated. As-prepared Pt-Co alloy nanoparticles exhibit a single-phase disordered structure and have a very small particle size. Such alloy catalysts exhibit an enhancement of a factor of ca. 1.3-3.2 in Pt mass activity and of a factor of ca. 1.2-2.2 in the specific activity for the ORR when compared to Pt/C catalyst. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the favorable Pt-Pt mean interatomic distance caused by alloying and to the high dispersion of the alloy catalysts. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33748979702	Room temperature preparation of carbon supported Pt-Ru catalysts	A carbon supported Pt-Ru (Pt-Ru/C-T) catalyst can be prepared by a chemical reduction method in an aqueous solution with tetrahydrofuran (THF) at room temperature. The Pt-Ru particles possess high alloying, small average size and a low relative crystallinity. The electrocatalytic activity of the prepared Pt-Ru/C catalyst for methanol oxidation is much higher than that of commercial Pt-Ru/C (Pt-Ru/C-E) catalysts which have a similar average size and relative crystallinity, but the alloying extent is much lower than that in our Pt-Ru/C-T catalyst. The results illustrate that the alloying extent of Pt and Ru in the Pt-Ru/C catalyst plays an important role in the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-Ru/C catalyst for methanol oxidation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

XRD patterns show that Pt atoms with fcc structure were almost replaced by Ru atoms with hcp structure. XRD and TEM measurements indicate that the average diameter is 2.7 nm with a uniform size. The electrocatalytic activity of Pt-Ru/CMK-3 for the ethanol oxidation was studied and compared with that of Pt-Ru/XC-72 of E-TEK congeneric catalyst. The results show that the catalyst of Pt-Ru/CMK-3 possesses a bigger electrocatalytic activity area, the electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of methanol and the ability of resisting CO poison exceed the same kind catalysts because of the appropriate extent of alloying and average particle diameter.

34147112954	Study of carbon-supported Au catalyst as the cathodic catalyst in a direct formic acid fuel cell prepared using a polyvinyl alcohol protection method	In this paper, it is reported for the first time that a carbon-supported Au (Au/C) catalyst for the cathodic catalyst in a direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) was prepared using a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) protection method. The results indicated that for oxygen reduction, the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst prepared with the PVA protection method is much better than that of a Au/C catalyst prepared with the pre-precipitation method. This is due to the small average size and low relative crystallinity of the Au particles in the Au/C catalyst prepared by the PVA protection method, compared to that of the Au/C catalyst prepared by the pre-precipitation method, illustrating that the average size and the relative crystallinity of the Au particles has an effect on the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst for oxygen reduction. In addition, because Au has no electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid, the Au/C catalyst possesses a high formic acid tolerance. After the electrocatalytic activity of the Au/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction is improved, it is suitable to be used as the cathodic catalyst in DFAFC. © 2007.

34250363991	Effect of structure of carbon nanotubes on electrocatalytic performance of carbon nanotubes supported Pt catalysts	The effect of the tube diameter of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the supporter of Pt catalyst on the electrocatalytic activity of the CNTs supported Pt(Pt/CNTs) catalysts was studied based on the preparation of CNTs with the single, double and multi walls. The Pt/CNTs catalysts were prepared using liquid phase reduction method. The XRD results demonstrate that the average sizes of the Pt particles in the Pt/CNTs catalysts with different tube diameters are almost the same(3.6 nm). However, the electrochemical results indicate that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/CNTs catalysts for the methanol oxidation increases with the decrease of the tube diameters of CNTs. The reason can be attributed to that CNTs with the small tube diameter possess large specific surface area and more oxygen-containing groups, which are favorable for the dispersion of the Pt particles in the Pt/CNTs catalysts. In addition, it has been reported in the literature that the resistance of CNTs with the single wall is smaller than that of CNTs with multi walls. Therefore, the above three factors lead to that the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt/CNTs catalysts with the small tube diameter of CNTs for the methanol oxidation is higher than that with the large tube diameter of CNTs.

36749059029	Carbon-supported Pd-Ir catalyst as anodic catalyst in direct formic acid fuel cell	It was reported for the first time that the electrocatalytic activity of the Carbon-supported Pd-Ir (Pd-Ir/C) catalyst with the suitable atomic ratio of Pd and Ir for the oxidation of formic acid in the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) is better than that of the Carbon-supported Pd (Pd/C) catalyst, although Ir has no electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid. The potential of the anodic peak of formic acid at the Pd-Ir/C catalyst electrode with the atomic ratio of Pd and Ir = 5:1 is 50 mV more negative than that and the peak current density is 13% higher than that at the Pd/C catalyst electrode. This is attributed to that Ir can promote the oxidation of formic acid at Pd through the direct pathway because Ir can decrease the adsorption strength of CO on Pd. However, when the content of Ir in the Pd-Ir/C catalyst is too high the electrocatalytic activity of the Pd-Ir/C catalyst would be decreased because Ir has no electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of formic acid. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The reason and mechanism of the excellent electrocatalytic activity and the poor electrocatalytic stability of the Pd/C catalyst have become an important investigation area of the anodic Pd catalyst in DFAFC. This paper mainly summarizes the situation of research and development of anodic Pd catalyst and Pd-based composite catalysts in DFAFC.

84867026047	New insights into enhanced electrocatalytic performance of carbon supported Pd-Cu catalyst for formic acid oxidation	The direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) has two major shortcomings that limit its lifespan and performance: (i) the poor electrocatalytic stability of the carbon supported Pd (Pd/C) catalyst and (ii) rapid decomposition of formic acid over the Pd/C catalyst. To solve the problems, the carbon-supported Pd-Cu (Pd-Cu/C) catalysts with different atomic ratios of Pd and Cu are successfully prepared with a simple impregnation-reduction method. It is reported for the first time that the electrocatalytic performances of the Pd-Cu/C catalysts for formic acid oxidation are related to the decomposition rate of formic acid over the Pd-Cu/C catalysts. When the content of Cu in the Pd-Cu/C catalysts is gradually increased, the decomposition rate of formic acid over the Pd-Cu/C catalysts is correspondingly decreased, leading to the decrease in the production of poisoned CO. Therefore, the electrocatalytic performances of the Pd-Cu/C catalysts for formic acid oxidation are much better than that of the Pd/C catalyst. However, when the content of Cu in the Pd-Cu/C catalyst is too high, the electrocatalytic performance of the Pd-Cu/C catalyst would be decreased because Cu has no electrocatalytic activity for formic acid oxidation. Based on the above reasons, among all Pd-Cu/C catalysts prepared, the electrocatalytic performance of the Pd-Cu/C catalyst with 3:1 atomic ratio of Pd and Cu for formic acid oxidation is best. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping demonstrated the hemoglobin (Hb) uniformly distributed into chitosan-CNTs composites matrix.

It was found that the polyglycol had a significant influence on the nucleation and pore formation in the ZnO nanostructure. The OH<sup>-</sup>concentration and the zinc counter-ion affected the morphology of the produced ZnO nanostructure. TPSP-ZnO can be used as an efficient matrix for immobilizing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and applied to sense hydrogen peroxide (H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>). Interestingly, it had better biosensing properties than solid spherical ZnO nanoparticles, which might result from the larger specific surface area of TPSP-ZnO, causing a higher HRP loading, and the tetragonal pyramid-shaped porous nanostructure having high fraction of surface atoms located on the corners and edges, resulting in an improved catalytic activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

It was found that the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the Pt/CG catalyst for ethanol oxidation depend on the weight ratio of carbon black and nanographite because the carbon black has a large surface area and nanographite has high conductivity.

It was found that the electrocatalytic activity of the Ru-Fe/C catalyst is much higher than that of the Ru/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction. It was further found that only alloying Fe with Ru can increase the electrocatalytic activity of the Ru/C catalyst for the oxygen reduction. In addition, The Ru-Fe/C catalyst has no electrocatalytic activity for the formic acid oxidation. Thus, the Ru-Fe/C has the high formic acid tolerance ability.

70350563933	Promote action of phosphotungstic acid for electrooxidation of fomic acid at carbon supported Pd catalyst	The promote action of phosphotungstic acid (PWA) in the electrolyte for the electrooxidation of formic acid at the carbon supported Pd (Pd/C) catalyst in the direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) was investigated using the energy dispersive spectromettry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical techniques. It was found that the adsorbed PWA could promote dehydrogen of formic acid, leading to the acceleration of the oxidation of formic acid at the Pd/C catalyst. Furthermore, the promote action is related to the PWA concentration. When the concentration of PWA is lower than 0.15 mg/mL the promote action increases with increasing the concentration of PWA. However, when the concentration of PWA is higher than 0.15 mg/mL overfull adsorbed PWA would cover too more active points of the Pd/C catalyst, leading to that the promote action of PWA decreases with increasing the concentration of PWA. Therefore, when the Concentration of PWA is 0.15 mg/mL the electrocatalytic performance of the Pd/C catalyst is best for the oxidation of formic acid.

The results showed that the surface layer of Pt-Ru/C catalyst was Ru-rich structure and possessed excellent synergistic effect for methanol electrocoxidation in the early stage of CV scan. While the cycling number increased from 1 to 35, the peak potential of methanol oxidation gradually shifted to the high potential, which was attributed to decrease of the synergistic effect owing to the dissolution of Ru atoms in the surface of Pt-Ru/C catalyst. When further increasing the cycling number to 36-80, the Ru content tends to be stable. However, the particles size of Pt-Ru nanoparticles gradually increased due to the moving and relocation of surface Pt atom, which resulted in the decrease of electrocatalytical activity of the catalyst for methanol oxidation.

77955831312	Electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid on carbon supported Pd-Pb alloy nanoparticles	Pd catalysts for formic acid oxidation had been extensively investigated due to potential application in direct formic acid fuel cells. To improve the stability of catalysts and promote the oxidation of formic acid through the direct pathway, various Pd-based bimetallic catalysts had been received much attention. In this work, Pd-Pb/C catalysts with different Pd/Pb atomic ratios were prepared by the impregnation-reduction method. The results of powder X-ray diffraction(XRD) and transmission electron microscope(TEM) measurement indicated that both crystal lattice constant and particle size of Pd-Pb alloy nanoparticles increased and decreased with increasing Pb/Pd atomic ratio, respectively. The electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid at Pd-Pb/C catalysts with different Pd/Pb atomic ratios was studied by cyclic voltammetry, CO-stripping and chronoamperometry measurements. It was found that the electrocatalytic activation of Pd-Pb/C electrocatalysts for formic acid oxidation decreases with the increase of Pb/Pd atomic ratio. This may be attributed to the addition of Pb, which results in the poison of Pd catalyst.

The electrochemical measurements indicate that the electro-catalytic activity and stability of PdCo hollow nano-spheres catalyst for formic acid oxidation is much better than that of the PdCo solid nano-spheres and Pd solid nano-spheres, which is ascribed to the unusual chemical and physical properties of the PdCo hollow nano-spheres, such as the interior micro/nano structure, the particular electronic property, and the promotion of the direct dehydrogenation path of formic acid oxidation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

It is found that the electrocatalytic performance of the Ir/MC catalyst for the oxygen reduction is better than that of the Ir/XC catalyst. The onset reduction potential of oxygen at the Ir/MC catalyst is 0.1 V more positive than that at the Ir/XC catalyst. The limiting current density of the oxygen reduction at the Ir/MC catalyst is 30% larger than that at the Ir/XC catalyst. This could be only attributed to the large pore diameter and porosity as well as high graphitization extent because the average diameters and relative crystallinity of the two catalysts are similar. In addition, both catalysts have good formic acid tolerance ability. Therefore, MC is a better carbon carrier of the catalyst than XC.

This was carried out using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The cyclic voltammograms indicate that the main peak potentials for the oxidation of formic acid at the Pd/XC and Pd/MC catalyst electrodes are similar and they are located at about 0.15 V. However, the peak current density of the Pd/MC catalyst electrode is about 30% larger than that of the Pd/ XC catalyst electrode. The chronoamperometric curves indicate that the peak current density at the Pd/MC catalyst electrode at 6000 s is about 38% larger than that at the Pd/XC catalyst electrode. These results show that the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the Pd/MC catalyst for the oxidation of formic acid are better than those of the Pd/XC catalyst. Because the average size and relative crystallinity of the Pd particles in the two catalysts are similar, the reason for the better electrocatalytic performance of the Pd/MC catalyst could be only attributed to its larger pore diameter and higher conductivity because of its high extent of MC graphitization. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.

The iron(iii) ion modified electrode displays the excellent electrocatalytic performance for reduction of hydrogen peroxide, and thus can be used as an electrochemical sensor for detecting hydrogen peroxide with a low detection limit (1.0 × 10<sup>-9</sup> M), a wide linear range (9.0 × 10<sup>-7</sup>∼5.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> M), as well as good stability, selectivity and reproducibility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 1212.

84863892384	Synthesis of water-soluble phosphonate functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes and their applications in biosensing	A facile noncovalent approach is proposed to graft phosphonate groups onto the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) by π-π stacking interactions between naphthalen-1-ylmethylphosphonic acid (NYPA) and SWNTs. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and zeta potential analysis confirm the phosphonate groups noncovalently attach on the SWNTs surface, in accordance with the prediction of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The phosphonate functionalized SWNTs have good solubility in polar solvent due to the big electrostatic repulsion between phosphonate groups, the strong hydration force of phosphonate groups and the partial debundling of SWNTs. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy measurements demonstrate the water-soluble phosphonate functionalized SWNTs almost completely preserve the electronic and structural integrity of the pristine SWNTs. Meanwhile, the as-prepared phosphonate functionalized SWNTs show good biocompatibility for protein immobilization. Consequently, myoglobin (Mb) proteins immobilized on the phosphonate functionalized SWNTs show excellent bioelectrocatalytic activity towards the reduction of hydrogen peroxide due to the exciting electronic properties of the phosphonate functionalized SWNTs and the fast electron transfer rate of Mb. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

84865276064	Fabrication of phosphonate functionalized platinum nanoclusters and their application in hydrogen peroxide sensing in the presence of oxygen	The water-soluble phosphonate functionalized spherical platinum nanoclusters (Pt-NCs) composed of primary nanoparticles are synthesized by the thermal decomposition of platinum(IV)-complex. The size, morphology and structure of Pt-NCs are analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Attachment of phosphonate groups on Pt surface is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and zeta potential analysis. The phosphonate functionalized Pt-NCs efficiently suppress the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while fully preserving the Pt-like activity for the hydrogen peroxid reduction reaction. Importantly, at certain cathodic potential, only reduction reaction of hydrogen peroxide occurs at the Pt-NCs surface. Consequently, the phosphonate functionalized Pt-NCs can be used to fabricate a new kind of hydrogen peroxide electrochemical sensor with high performance in the presence of oxygen.

The results showed that for Pt/C electrocatalyst methanol oxidation and ORR occurred with no apparent interaction above 0.64 V and below 0.18 V vs SCE. But in the range of 0.18 to 0.64 V, methanol adversely affects the performance of Pt/C for ORR. The methanol had no effect on the performance of CoPcTc/C heat-treated at 800°C for ORR. Thus CoPcTc/C heat-treated at 800°C is a promising catalyst for ORR with higher activity and good methanol-tolerant ability.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy confirm sulphydryl groups attach on MWCNT surface. Meanwhile, the phosphate-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuP-NPs) are obtained by using an improved phosphorus reduction method.

84871394884	Improvement and mechanism of electrocatalytic performance of Pd-Ni/C anodic catalyst in direct formic acid fuel cell	One problem of carbon supported Pd (Pd/C) anodic catalyst in direct formic acid fuel cell (DFAFC) is the poor electrocatalytic stability. Thus, the carbon supported Pd-Ni (Pd-Ni/C) catalyst was successfully synthesized via the high-temperature calcination and chemical etching. It was found that the electrocatalytic performance of the Pd-Ni/C catalyst for formic acid oxidation is much better than that of the Pd/C catalyst. It is due to two reasons. One is that the Pd-Ni/C catalyst prepared possesses the high alloy extent because the Pd based catalysts with high alloy extent possess usually the high electrocatalytic performance. Another is that the Pd-Ni/C catalyst can inhibit the decomposition of formic acid. Therefore, the Pd-Ni/C catalyst could be significantly protected from CO poisoning, leading to the excellent electrocatalytic stability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

Herein, PAH is used efficiently as a complex-forming agent, capping agent, and facet-selective agent. The strong interaction between PAH and Pd atom sharply changes the electronic structure of Pd atom in the Pd icosahedra. The protective function of PAH layers and enhanced antietching capability of Pd atom are responsible for the formation of the Pd icosahedra. Very importantly, the as-prepared PAH functionalized Pd icosahedra exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity and ethanol tolerant ability toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared to the commercially available Pt black in alkaline media. At 0.95 V (vs RHE), the ORR specific kinetic current density at the Pd icosahedra is 4.48 times higher than that at commercial Pt black. The fact demonstrates the appropriate surface modification of the Pd nanoparticles by nonmetallic molecules can be regarded as an effective way to enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

The Pd/C catalyst electrode in the electrolyte with 0.5 mmol/L EDTMP displays the best electrocatalytic activity and stability for formic acid oxidation. This result is attributed to that the adsorbed EDTMP on the surface of Pd not only decreases the amount of adsorbed CO at the Pd/C catalyst electrode by the ensemble effect but also inhibits the decomposition of formic acid over the Pd/C catalyst to decrease the CO poisoning. However, when the concentration of EDTMP is higher than 0.5 mmol/L, overfull adsorbed EDTMP would occupy the active sites of Pd to decrease the electrocatalytic performance.
