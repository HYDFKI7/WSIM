84927743573	AFM detection of biophysical characteristics of specific regulatory T Cells after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation	Background: Based on the dynamics of antigen recognition from T cell receptor complex and T cell activation, different function of T cells may present different morphology feature, at least at molecular level. Regulatory T (Treg) cells play a critic role in regulation the onset of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Little is known about their morphology feature which may relate to the regulating function in GVHD. Results: In this study, we detected the biophysical architectural changes of specific Treg cells subsets after allo-HSCT using biological atomic force microscopy to characterize their biological characteristics and improve our understanding of cell structure-function relationships in GVHD. There were dramatic overall shape and surface membrane deformations of the Treg cells associated with patients at GVHD onset or without GVHD. The Treg cells at GVHD onset or without GVHD could be distinguished by the morphologic parameters of morphology, membrane nanostructure, and membrane pore. These AFM parameters of Treg cells morphology differed obviously between GVHD and without GVHD. The multiple irregular microspikes could be observed on the surface of Treg cells without GVHD. Conclusions: The remarkable biological morphology changes in the cell membrane structure of Treg cells after allo-HSCT might be related to the function of Treg cells which could inhibit the occurrence and development of GVHD.

22144473366	Expression of neuropilin-1 gene in bone marrow stromal cells from patients with myeloid leukemia and normal individuals	Objective: To investigate the expression of neuropilin-1 (NP-1) gene in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from myeloid leukemia (AML and CML) and normal individuals. Methods: Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone marrow (BM) of CML (14 cases), AML (12 cases) and normal individuals (20 cases). Adherent cells (i.e. BMSCs) were collected after long-term culture in vitro. The expression ofNP-1 gene in three groups was detected respectively by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The long-term culture of BMSCs was successfully established. The expression level of NP-1 gene was significantly lower in BMSCs from AML (47.1%) and CML (50%) than in normal individuals (85%). Conclusion: NP-1 gene is expressed in BMSCs from some AML or CML patients and most normal individuals. The low-expression of NP-1 gene in BMSCs from AML or CML patients might be related with abnormality of regulation in hematopoiesis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

29144462172	The TCR Vβ repertoire usage of T-cells from cord blood induced by chronic myelogenous leukemia associated antigen	Understanding the clonality and restricted usage of the TCR Vβ repertoire of expanded T-cells induced by the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) associated antigen may be useful in helping design new immunotherapeutic strategies specifically for CML. T-cells from cord blood that had been stimulated by different stimulators (IL-2, PHA, CML cells, K562 cells and bcr-abl peptide) were amplified in vitro by liquid T-cell culture and the mixed lymphocyte and tumor cell culture (MLTC) method. By using the RT-PCR, the CDR3 segments of 24 variable region genes of TCR β was analyzed in T-cells from 22 cases of cord blood before and after T-cell culture, to observe the usage of TCR Vβ repertoire. The PCR products were further labeled with fluorescence and analyzed by the Genescan technique for the CDR3 size, to evaluating clonality of the detectable TCR Vβ T-cells. Only a part of 24 Vβ subfamily T-cells (3-15 subfamilies) could be detected, however, all of the 24 TCR Vβ subfamily of T-cells were detected after in vitro culture with PHA or IL-2+ anti-CD3 antibody. The number of expressed TCR Vβ subfamilies was gradually reduced by prolonging the time of culture with CML-associated antigens. The restricted expression of TCR Vß subfamilies and oligoclonal expansion of Vβ21 T-cells were found in cultured T-cells induced by CML cells, K562 cells or bcr-abl peptide. In conclusion, T-cells from cord blood may have the potential capability of proliferation in different TCR Vβ subfamily T-cells, and the ability for restricted expression and clonal expansion, when T-cells were induced by CML associated antigen. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

33646586718	Heat shock fusion protein induces both specific and nospecific anti-tumor immunity	Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a tumor antigen, and the most important epitopes that can induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) reside in the variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR). Heat shock protein (HSP) complexes isolated from tumors have been shown to induce specific anti-tumor immunity. HSP alone can also induce nonspecific immunity. To explore the possibility to utilize the specific anti-tumor immunity induced by MUC1 VNTR and the nonspecific immunity induced by HSP, we constructed a recombinant protein (HSP65-MUC1) by fusing Bacillus Calmette-Guérin-derived HSP65 with the MUC1 VNTR peptide and tested its ability to induce anti-tumor activities in a tumor challenge model. The growth of MUC1-expressing tumors was significantly inhibited in mice immunized with HSP65-MUC1, both before and after tumor challenge. A much larger percentage of immunized mice survived the tumor challenge than non-immunized mice. Correlating with the anti-tumor activity, HSP65-MUC1 was shown to induce MUC1-specific CTL as well as nonspecific anti-tumor immunity. In the human system, HSP65-MUCl-loaded human DC induced the generation of autologous MUC1-specific CTL in vitro. These results suggest that exogenously applied HSP65-MUC1 may be used to treat MUC1 tumors by inducing the epitope-specific CTL as well as nonspecific anti-tumor responses mediated by the HSP part of the fusion protein. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34250780498	Protective effects of fusion protein of Hsp65-MOMP-T-epitopes on C. trachomatis genital tract infection of mice	Objective: To evaluate the protective ability of fusion protein of Hsp65-MOMP-T-epitopes (H-ctm1) against C. trachomatis (Ct) genital tract infection. Methods: Female C57BL/6 mice aged 6-8 weeks were divided into H-ctm1, heat-killed EBs (HK-EBs) and PBS group (28 mice in each group, 9 for detection of the amount of Ct IFU in vaginal tract of mice; 10 for histopathology; 9 for analysis of hydrosalpinx situation). They were immunized by H-ctm1, HK-EBs and PBS, respectively. 7 d before inoculation with Ct through vagina, progesterone was administered to all the experimental mice by subcutaneous injection. The number of Ct shedding from genital tract, inflammation score of genital tract, and situation of hydrosalpinx were evaluated between the three groups. Results: On the 3rd and 6th day after infection, there was no significant difference of the amount of Ct in vaginal tract of mice between H-ctm1 and HK-EBs immunized groups; however, they were lower than that in PBS-immunized group (P<0.01). On the 9th and 18th day afterinfection, the amount of Ct in vaginal tract in H-ctm1immunized group was lower than that in HK-EBS immunized group (P<0.01 or P<0.05). 6 d after infection, the inflammation scares in H-ctm1 immunized mice and HK-EBs immunized mice were lower than that in PBS immunized mice (P<0.01 or P<0.05). 12 d after infection, there were significant differences of vaginal inflammation scores between H-ctm1 immunized mice and HK-EBS immunized mice or PBS immunized mice (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Hydrosalpinx was not found in H-ctm1 or HK-EBS immunized mice 40 d after infection. In contrast, unilateral or bilateral hydrosalpinx was present in all nine PBS immunized mice. Conclusion: Protective immune response can be induced in the mice immunized with H-ctm1 following the Ct infection of genital tract. H-ctm1 as a candidate vaccine can shorten the duration of Ct infection effectively, which is better than HK-EBs.

34548275404	Primary screening of antitumor immunoadjuvants combined with heat shock fusion protein	Objective: To screen one kind of antitumor immunoadjuvant that could enhance the anti-tumor activity of heat shock fusion protein (HSP-MUC1). Methods: MUC1-positive tumor bearing mice were subcutaneously injected by HSP-MUC1 combined with a novel CpG ODN or hIFNα2b, four groups were set up respectively as PBS, HSP-MUC1, CpG ODN (IFNα2b) and HSP-MUC1 + CpG ODN (HSP-MUC1 + IFNα2b). The tumor incidence and tumor volume in various groups were observed and calculated. Results: The tumor incidence and tumor weight of mice in HSP-MUC1 + CpG ODN group were lower than those in PBS group and HSP-MUC1 group (P< 0.05); CpG ODN alone also displayed the similar anti-tumor effect as HSP-MUC1 + CpG ODN, it could decrease the tumor incidence and tumor weight of mice compared with PBS and HSP-MUC1 (P<0.05); And the tumor incidence and tumor weight of mice in HSP-MUC1 + hIFNα2b group had no difference with those in PBS group and HSP-MUC1 group (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: CpG ODN could enhance the anti-tumor activity of HSP-MUC1 but need to be further determined for its optimal injection time; and human IFNα2b could not enhance the anti-tumor activity of HSP-MUC1.

34547540905	GATA-1, -2 and -3 genes expression in bone marrow microenviroment with chronic aplastic anemia	Both bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and transcription factors (GATA-1, GATA-2 and GATA-3) are important in the normal hematopoiesis and the pathogenesis of hematopoietic disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of GATA-1, GATA-2 and GATA-3 genes in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment from patients with chronic aplastic anemia (cAA) and normal individuals. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from BM of patients with cAA (8 cases) and normal controls (9 cases). Adherent cells (i.e. BMSCs) were collected after long-term culture in vitro. The semi-quantitative expression levels of GATA genes were analyzed by using RT-PCR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (RT-PCR-ELISA). The BMSCs with cAA grew slowly compared with the normal BMSCs. In BMSCs, only the expression ratio of GATA-3 gene from cAA group (50.0%) was significant lower than the normal controls (P < 0.05), the expression ratios of other GATA genes from cAA group were similar to the normal controls. There was no difference in the expression level of GATA-1 gene in the BMSCs between normal controls and cAA group. The expression level of GATA-2 gene in BMSCs from cAA was significantly lower than that from normal controls (P < 0.05). The expression level of GATA-3 gene in BMSCs from cAA was significantly higher than that from normal controls (P < 0.05). The dominant expression of GATA-3 gene was found in the BMSCs from cAA and normal controls. GATA genes can be expressed in the BMSCs and may play a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis in normal individuals, as well as in patients with cAA. The change of expression levels of GATA genes may influence the hematopoiesis in BM microenvironment and relate to the pathogenesis and development of aplastic anemia.

34548585992	A CpG oligodeoxynucleotide inducing anti-coxsackie B3 virus activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells	Coxsackie B3 virus (CVB3) is the most significant pathogen causing myocarditis in humans, and antiviral therapy would be most effective in the early stages of the disease. Here we provide evidence that BW001, a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, induces anti-CVB3 activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In parallel, we have demonstrated that BW001 induces human PBMCs to express mRNAs of multiple types of interferon (IFN), including IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ω and IFN-γ, and to express mRNAs of at least 11 subtypes of IFN-α. The induced IFNs may contribute to the anti-CVB3 activity. The results suggest that BW001 could be developed into a medication with the potential to treat CVB3 infectious diseases by inducing natural mixed IFNs. © 2007 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

34848866276	Ovarian steroid cell tumor, not otherwise specified: A clinicopathologic study	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features, diagnostic criteria, differential diagnosis and treatment options of ovarian steroid cell tumor, not otherwise specified (NOS). Methods: Light microscopy and immunohistochemical study was carried out in 8 cases of ovarian steroid cell tumor, NOS. The literature was reviewed. Results: The 7 cases of benign ovarian steroid cell tumor, NOS were composed mainly of polygonal cells with granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and larger cells with vacuolated cytoplasm. They resembled the architecture of normal adrenal gland, with formation of cell nests and trabeculae. The single case of malignant ovarian steroid cell tumor had evidence of significant cellular pleomorphism, haemorrhage and coagulative tumor necrosis. The mitotic count measured about 7 per 10 high-power fields. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells expressed calretinin and α-inhibin. Differential diagnosis included oxyphilic granulosa cell tumor, thecoma, Sertoli cell tumor and clear cell carcinoma. The treatment options of benign ovarian steroid cell tumor, NOS was local excision or ipsilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, while the malignant counterpart should be treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, including administration of GnRH agonist. Conclusions: Ovarian steroid cell tumor, NOS, is the most common type of ovarian steroid cell tumors. Most of which are associated with a benign clinical outcome. Immunohistochemistry is an important adjunct for diagnosis. The treatment options of ovarian steroid cell tumor, NOS depend on its malignant potential.

36148999848	TRAV and TRBV repertoire, clonality and the proliferative history of umbilical cord blood T-cells	Umbilical cord blood (CB) has been used successfully as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation. But the distribution and clonality of T-cell receptor alpha variable region (TRAV) and T-cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamily T-cells, the naïve T-cells level and the diversity of thymic recent output function in CB has not been yet clearly defined. In order to characterize the repertoire of CB T-cells, the CDR3 of 29 TRAV and 24 TRBV subfamily genes were analyzed in T-cells from 12 cord blood samples, using RT-PCR and genescan technique. To determine the proliferative history of CB T-cells, quantitative analysis of δRec-ψJα signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) was performed in mononuclear cells, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from 20 CB samples by real-time PCR. In addition the analysis of 23 TRBV-TRBD1 sjTRECs in 10 cases of CB CD4+ T-cells and CB CD8+ T-cells was performed by semi-nested PCR. We found a marked restriction of TRBV expression pattern in CBMCs compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which expressed all 24 TRBV genes. All PCR products of TRAV and TRBV subfamilies from CB, except for 3 cases, displayed polyclonal rearrangement pattern. The δRec-ψJα sjTRECs counts were significantly higher in CB, than in PB samples. Also the number of detectable TRBV sjTRECs was higher in CB than in peripheral blood. In conclusion, our results indicate polyclonal but restricted repertoire and a very short proliferative history of CB T-cells. The incomplete repertoire and naivety of CB T-cells might be the reason that CB hematopoietic stem cells transplant recipients are less likely to develop graft vs host disease. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

38349121354	Distribution of intravenously grafted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in the viscera tissues of rats before and after cerebral ischemia	Aim: The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells administered intravenously,intra-arterially,or intracerebrally could preferentially migrate to the injured region of the brain.But little is known about the ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to migrate to the non-injured region.Our study was to observe the distribution and survival of intravenously grafted rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vivo before and after cerebral ischemia in rats,and provide the experimental evidence and possible theoretic explanation for study on stem cell transplantation. Methods: Experiments were conducted in the Neurology Institute of Fujian Province from May 2006 to May 2007. Experimental materials: F344 rats were provided by Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center,Chinese Academy of Sciences. Totally 48 healthy adult male F344 rats weighing 250-300 g were randomly divided into 3 groups, group A,group B,and group C,with 16 rats in each.All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines provided by Laboratory Animal Committee. Experimental methods: 1 The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were obtained from the male F344 rats of two months old,cultured in vitro,and the third and fourth generation bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were adopted.Ex vivo-expanded bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were transduced with the lentiviral vectors which already carried enhanced green fluorescent protein gene. 2 The rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion,then the behavior changes of rats were observed.The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells marked with enhanced green fluorescent protein were infused into the femoral vein of rats. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation was carried out in rats of the group A. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation was carried out 24 hours before middle cerebral artery occlusion in the group B. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation was carried out 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the group C. 3 Neurological function was assessed by modified Neurological Severity Score. The tissue samples of brain,heart,lung,liver,spleen,kidney, skeletal muscle,small intestine and bone marrow of rats were collected,then the frozen sections and bone marrow smear were prepared.The distribution of enhanced green fluorescent protein positive cells was observed under the fluorescent microscope. Results: All the 48 rats were involved in the result analysis. 1 Within 12 weeks after transplantation,the neurological function deficit in the group B and group C was obviously recovered,but the recovery was rapid in the group C. The recovery was significantly improved as compared with the group B in the first,third and twelfth week(P < 0.01,P < 0.05). 2 In the group A and group B,enhanced green fluorescent protein positive cells were found in bone marrow sample, lung,spleen and intestine samples,but not in the other tissues. In the group C,enhanced green fluorescent protein positive cells were localized to the ischemic region. Few marked cells were observed in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere or other tissues except a few in lung. Conclusion: The cerebral injury before transplantation is very important and necessary for intravenously grafted Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells migrating to ischemic focus,otherwise,the grafted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells will settle down in bone marrow,spleen,and never migrate to other tissues again.

32044432614	Anti-SARS-CoV immunity induced by a novel CpG oligodeoxynucleotide	To develop CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs) based therapy for prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), we selected a novel CpG ODN (BW001), which displays B-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 5′ and A-type CpG ODN structure feature at the 3′, and tested for its anti-SARS-CoV activity. We found that the supernatants of human PBMCs stimulated by BW001 significantly protected Vero cells from SARS-CoV infection. BW001 could stimulate human PBMCs and pDCs to secrete high level of IFN-α and promote human PBMCs and B cells to proliferate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BW001 could activate CD19

40649105084	The feature of distribution and clonal expansion TCR Va subfamily T cells from peripheral blood in patients with DLBL	Objective: To investigate the situation of TCR Vα gene repertoire and clonal expansion in peripheral blood T cells from patients with diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBL). Methods: The complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) of TCR Vα 29 subfamily genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 6 cases with DLBL was amplified using RT-PCR, the products were further labelled by fluorescein and then analyzed by genes -scan technique for detecting the CDR3 size, thus determining clonality of T cells. Results: 20-23 Vα subfamilies were identified in 6 DLBL cases respectively. Clonal expansive T cells in one or more Vα subfamilies were found in all 6 patients, including oligoclonal/oligoclonal trend and bioclonal patterns. The higher frequency of clonal expansive T cells was predominately in Vα6 and Vα23 subfamilies (66.7 %). Conclusion: The restricted usage and clonal expansion of TCR Vα subfamily T cells could be found on the patients with DLBL. This feature may be related to the host immune response for DLBL associated antigen.

84867387192	The differential expression pattern of the BMI-1, SALL4 and ABCA3 genes in myeloid leukemia	Background and methods: In order to characterize the expression pattern of SALL4, BMI-1 and ABCA3 genes in patients with myeloid leukemia and those who achieved complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy. Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of these genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 24 patients with AML, eight patients with AML-CR, 13 patients with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP), 12 patients with CML in blast crisis (CML-BC), 13 patients with CML-CR and 11 healthy individuals (HI).Results: Overexpression of the BMI-1 gene was found in the AML, CML-CP and CML-BC groups as compared with HI group, while the BMI-1 expression level was lower in patients who achieved CR. In contrast, significantly increased SALL4 expression was only found in AML group, additionally, SALL4 expression was lower in the CML-CP and CML-CR groups compared with the HI group, while the SALL4 expression level in the CML-BC group was higher and significantly greater than that in the CML-CP and CML-CR groups. Moreover, a positive correlation between the expression of SALL4 and BMI-1 genes was found in samples from most groups. There was no significant difference of ABCA3 expression level in AML and CML-BC group in comparison with HI group. Interestingly, the ABCA3 expression level was significantly decreased in the CML-CP, AML-CR and CML-CR in comparison with the HI group. Moreover, the ABCA3 expression level in all of the CR groups was lower than that in their corresponding groups.Conclusions: These results describe the altered SALL4, ABCA3 and BMI-1 expression pattern in different phases of myeloid leukemia, which may relate to the development and progression to different diseases. SALL4 expression was strongly correlated with BMI-1 in most of the myeloid leukemia patient groups, providing a potential link between SALL4 and BMI-1 in leukemogenesis. © 2012 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84867453949	Recombinant mycobacterial HSP65 in combination with incomplete Freund's adjuvant induced rat arthritis comparable with that induced by complete Freund's adjuvant	Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing the inactivated mycobacterium has been conventionally used to induce typical arthritis in rats. In comparison, incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), lacking the mycobacterium, can only induce less severe arthritis. However, the key components responsible for the arthritogenic effect of the whole mycobacterium are rarely known. Although mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (MHSP65) specific humoral and cellular immune responses were detected in rats with arthritis induced by CFA, MHSP65 alone cannot induce arthritis. In this study, we replaced the whole mycobacterium in CFA with recombinant MHSP65 (rMHSP65), prepared rMHSP65-IFA emulsion by mixing rMHSP65 and IFA, and investigated whether rMHSP65-IFA could induce arthritis in rats as CFA did. We found that intradermal injection of the rMHSP65-IFA emulsion induced arthritic lesions in testing animals to the same degree as those induced by CFA, manifested by severe swelling in hind paws, and synovial thickening, cartilage erosion and lymphocytes infiltration in ankle joints. Notably, the rMHSP65-IFA recipe also induced the production of anti-dsDNA and -rMHSP65 antibodies in rats. These results thus demonstrate that rMHSP65 can be used to substitute the inactivated mycobacteria in CFA to induce typical arthritis in rats. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84877781422	The characteristic expression pattern of BMI-1 and SALL4 genes in placenta tissue and cord blood	Introduction. SALL4 and BMI-1 are important factors in hematopoiesis. Placental tissue (PT) and umbilical cord blood (CB) are rich in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs), but their SALL4 and BMI-1 expression levels remain unknown. Methods. Real-time PCR was used to determine the expression level of these genes in PT and CB from ten cases, and ten healthy donors were used as controls. Results: A significantly higher BMI-1 and SALL4 gene expression level was found in PT (median: 17.548 and 34.362, respectively) than in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) (median: 2.071 and 11.300, respectively) (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.007) and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (median: 0.259 and 0.384, respectively) (P = 0.001 and P <0.0001), and their expression level was lower in PBMCs than in CBMCs (P = 0.029 and P = 0.002). A positive correlation between the BMI-1 and SALL4 genes was found in the PT and CB groups, while there was no significant correlation between these genes in the healthy group. There was also no significant correlation between the expression level of each gene in PT and CB. Conclusions: These results describe the characteristic features of the BMI-1 and SALL4 gene expression pattern in placental tissue and cord blood. Placental tissue with higher expression level of both genes may be considered as a potential resource for SALL4-related HPC expansion. © 2013 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84887621493	Upregulated ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene correlates with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	The ataxia-telangiectasia group D complementing gene (ATDC) plays significant roles in various human cancers. However, the clinical significance of ATDC in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has not been investigated. The ATDC messenger RNA level of 40 paired ESCC and nonneoplastic tissues were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, 10 pairs of which were also used for Western blot analysis. In addition, immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the ATDC expression in 118 paraffin-embedded cancerous and matched nonneoplastic tissues, and the correlation of ATDC expression with the clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of the ESCC patients was analyzed. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blot results demonstrated that the expression level of ATDC was significantly higher in ESCC tissue than in matched noncancerous tissues. Both ATDC messenger RNA and protein expression in the ESCC tissue were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, stage, and lymph node metastasis. However, there was no significant difference in ATDC expression based on patient age or gender. Moreover, the results of both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that increased ATDC expression was correlated with a shorter 5-year survival time for ESCC patients after surgery. We concluded that increased ATDC expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes and that this marker might be a useful indicator for prognosis and a promising target for therapy in ESCC patients. © 2012 Copyright the Authors.

84897973786	The biophysical property of A549 cells transferred by VEGF-D	Vascular endothelial growth factor-D (VEGF-D) together with VEGF-C is considered to be associated with lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis and involve in tumorization. This study aims to investigate the influence of exogenous VEGF-D gene on the biophysical property of cell surface of lung adenocarcinoma cell line. A panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined the expression of VEGF-D and VEGF-C by real-time PCR. The VEGF-D recombinant plasmid containing enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was constructed and transfected to the cell line with no expression of VEGF-D and confirmed by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Topographic images of cells were obtained by using atomic force microscope (AFM) in contact mode. Unlike VEGF-C, VEGF-D was found to have a very low expression or undetectable expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. The VEGF-D recombinant plasmid had been constructed successfully and was transferred into the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cells which had no endogenous expression of VEGF-D, and exogenous VEGF-D could be detected in mRNA and protein expression levels in the gene modified cells, while the VEGF-C gene expression had no change after VEGF-D transfection. After transfection, the irregular microspikes or nano clusters could observe on the surface of A549 cells, and VEGF-D transfected A549 cells became more rigid. The exogenous VEGF-D gene might cause the remarkable biophysical architectural changes in the A549 cells, which might as a novel biomarker for evaluation of its biological function. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

42449153866	Preparation and swelling behaviour of polyampholyte hydrogels composed of acryloyloxyethyl-trimethyl ammonium chloride and acrylic acid	A series of poly (acryloyloxy ethyl trimethyl ammonium choride-co-acrylic acid) hydrogels were synthesized by solution polymerization and the structure of hydrogel was characterized by FTIR and NMR. Meanwhile, the swelling behavior of hydrogels in distilled water with various pH values and the salt solutions with different concentrations were investigated. The results show that the hydrogel with equal molar negative charges and positive charges presented an antipolyelectrolyte effect. Ionic strength drastically affected the swelling behavior of hydrogels. At the same time, the swelling kinetic parameters of swelling process of hydrogels were also calculated in salt solutions with different concentrations and the results illuminated that the first 60% swelling process of hydrogels was governed by Fickian diffusion mechanism (n ≤ 0.5) in the salt solution with a high ionic strength. With the increase of ionic strength, the swelling ratio of the hydrogels and diffusion coefficients increased.

42249111391	Deficient mRNA expression of specific protein 3 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with multiple sclerosis	Objective: To characterize the deficiency of the mRNA expression of specific protein 3 (SP3) gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Chinese patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and study its correlation with the disease phenotypes. Methods: Fifty-six patients with definite MS were collected and total RNA was extracted from their PBMCs. Specific primers corresponding to SP3 gene were designed and the mRNA expression of SP3 gene was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) method. The deficiency of SP3 expression was compared among MS patients, irrelavant disease group and normal controls. Results: Of the 56 MS cases, 23 (41.1%) were SP3 - deficient. In contrast, the frequency of SP3 - deficiency in normal subjects and irrelavant disease controls was 8.6% (5/35) and 14.3% (4/27), respectively. The frequency of the SP3 - expression deficiency in MS patients was significantly higher than that in both control groups (P < 0.01). Within the MS cases, the scores of expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in the SP3 - expressing subjects were significantly different from that in the SP3 - deficient ones in the stable, but not in the active, phase of MS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Author's observation suggested that deficient expression of SP3 gene occurs in Chinese MS patients, and that the SP3 expression may correlate with the clinical manifestations of MS and play roles in its immunological pathogenesis.

62549141777	Human microsatellite DNA mimicking oligodeoxynucleotides down-regulate TLR9-dependent and -independent activation of human immune cells	To develop novel immunoregulatory oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), we have designed a series of ODNs based on the sequences in human microsatellite (MS) DNA. The ODNs, designated as human MS DNA mimicking ODNs (MS ODNs), have been studied for their inhibitory effects on human immune cells activated by TLR9-dependent and -independent stimulations. We find for the first time that MS08, a MS ODN composed entirely of TC dinucleotide (TC) repeats, inhibits CpG ODN (TLR9 ligand)-induced human PBMCs proliferation, CD80 and CD86 expression and production of interferon. In addition, MS08 also inhibits the proliferation of human PBMCs stimulated by PHA, PMA and alloantigens in a TLR9-independent manner. The inhibition correlates with competition of binding and uptake between MS08 and CpG ODN in human PBMCs. Structurally, TC, CT or CCT are revealed as essential suppressive motifs required for the inhibition. These findings suggest that TC repeat containing MS ODN could be of therapeutic use in pathologic situations due to excessive activation of immune cells. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

67349101236	Reduced levels of recent thymic emigrants in acute myeloid leukemia patients	Background: T cell immunodeficiency is a common feature in cancer patients, which may relate to initiation and development of tumor. Our previous study showed skewed expression of T cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamilies and clonal expansion of T cells in leukemia patients. In the present study, in order to further characterize the T cell immunity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the level of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) was analyzed. Materials and methods: Quantitative analysis of signal joint T cell recombination excision circles (δRec-ψJα sjTRECs) was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by real-time PCR (TaqMan), and the analysis of 23 TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs was performed by semi-nested PCR. Eighty-eight cases with AML were selected for this study; ten AML cases in complete remission (AML-CR) and 38 healthy individuals served as controls. Results: The levels of δRec-ψJα sjTRECs in PBMCs and CD3+ T cells were significantly decreased in AML patients, compared with healthy individuals and in patients in completive remission. Also the frequency of 23 TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs, and the number of detectable TRBV subfamily sjTRECs were significantly lower in AML patients than in healthy individuals. Moreover, the sjTRECs numbers and the frequency of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs showed a progressive linear decline with age in AML patients. Conclusions: The decreased numbers of universal (δRec-ψJα) and family-specific (TRBV-BD1) sjTRECs indicate that the severe T cell immunodeficiency in AML patients is associated with reduced levels of recent thymic emigrants. In patients achieving complete remission both sjTREC counts return to normal values indicating the recovery of thymic function. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying persistent immunodeficiency in leukemia patients may lead to novel treatment strategies to enhance immune competence. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

67349183328	Therapeutic injection of C-class CpG ODN in draining lymph node area induces potent activation of immune cells and rejection of established breast cancer in mice	In order to develop novel CpG ODNs for the treatment of breast cancer, we have designed a series of CpG ODNs and evaluated their anti-tumor activity in a breast cancer mouse model. Interestingly, a C-class CpG ODN, designated as YW002, showed a vigorous activity on the inhibition of tumor growth in mice and completely cured some of the tumor-bearing mice through injection at tumor draining lymph node (TDLN) area. The expansion of immune cells in the TDLN and tumor and the generation of tumor specific immune memory were found associated with YW002-induced anti-tumor activity in mice. These results indicate that C-class CpG ODN could be developed into a medicament in a monotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of breast cancer through injection at TDLN area in clinic. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

69749114546	Therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral vector mediated BDNF gene-modified MSCs in cerebral infarction	Pretreatment with brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF) reduces ischemic damage after focal cerebral ischemia, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) were reported to ameliorate functional deficits after stroke in rats. Here we investigate the synergistically therapeutic effects of BDNF gene-modified MSCs on cerebral infarction. We transfected MSCs with the BDNF gene using a lentivirus-based system and investigated whether the BDNF-modified MSCs contributed to improved functional recovery in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion(MCAO) model. Compared to untreated rats, rats that received both MSCs and BDNF-MSCs showed significantly more functional recovery. The difference in modified neurological severity score(mNSS) was statistically significant(P < 0.001). Recovery was better in BDNF-MSCs than in MSCs(P < 0.001). At the second week and second month after the systemic delivery of blank vector-modified MSCs and BDNF-modified MSCs, the treated rats exhibited more significant recovery than the control, including the accumulation and living of enhanced green fluorescence protein(EGFP)-positive cells in the infarct area and surrounding areas, neuron-like changes, expression of surface markers of neural cells, and a large amount of BDNF expression in the BDNF-MSCs-treated group. Our findings suggest that BDNF-gene-modified rMSCs can migrate to surrounding areas of the cerebral infarction lesion, differentiate into neural cells, and survive for extended periods. With the synergy of BDNF, they may promote the recovery of the neurological function following cerebral infarction and represent a new strategy for stem cell-based therapy. © 2008 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

70349303622	Expression pattern of GATA-1, -2 and -3 genes in leukemic bone marrow microenvironment	Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the expression pattern of hematopoietic transcription factor GATA-1, -2 and -3 genes in leukemic bone marrow (BM) microenvironment [including bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and BM hematopoietic cells]. Methods: Mononuclear cells were isolated from BM of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Adherent cells (BMSCs) and nonadherent cells (BM hematopoietic cells) were collected after long-term culture in vitro. The semi-quantitative expression levels of GATA genes in the BMSCs or BM hematopoietic cells from patients with leukemia were analyzed by using RT-PCR-ELISA and compared with normal controls. Results: The expression level of GATA-1 gene in the BMSCs from CML group was significantly lower than that of the normal controls. The expression level of GATA-3 gene in the BMSCs from ALL was higher than that of the normal controls, but that from CML was lower than the normal controls. Dominant expression of GATA-3 gene was found in the normal BM hematopoietic cells. The dominant expression of GATA-2 gene was found in the normal BMSCs and the BMSCs from CML, whereas the dominant expression of GATA-3 gene was detected in the BMSCs from AML. Conclusion: GATA-1, -2 and -3 genes might play a role in hematopoiesis regulation in leukemia, and the changes of expression pattern of GATA genes might influence the hematopoiesis in BM microenvironment and relate to the pathogenesis and development of leukemia. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

74049087085	The feature of clonal expansion of TCR Vp repertoire, thymic recent output function and TCRf chain expression in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura	In order to identify the feature of T cells immune status in idiopathic/ immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients, TCR Vβ repertoire, T-cell receptor (TCR) excision DNA circles (TRECs) and TCR chain gene expression were examined. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, genescan and real-time PCR techniques were used to analyze. DNA and cDNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 18 ITP patients were investigated and 25 normal individuals served as control. The results showed that only 4-11 Vβ subfamilies could be detected in each ITP case. The most frequently expressed Vβ subfamilies were Vβ2andVβ3, while 11 Vβ subfamilies were absent. Clonal expansion of Vβ T cells were found in all patients. The most frequent clonal expansion T cell was Vβ21. The number of TRECs in ITP patients (2.60 ± 2.99 copies/1000 PBMCs) was not significant different, compared with control (3.76 ± 3.42 copies/1000 PBMCs). The expression level of TCR gene was significantly lower in ITP samples than those in control (P = 0.017). In summary, T cells in ITP patients were characterized by restricted expression of TCR Vβ subfamilies and clonal expansion predominant in Vβ21. The alteration of peripheral TCR Vβ repertoire pattern may not relate to the thymic, recent output function in ITP patients. Our report is the first description of decreased TCR mRNA level in the majority of ITP patients. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

75349098019	Construction of rat CXCR4 gene lentiviral RNA interference vector and its expression in mesenchymal stem cells	To construct the lentiviral RNA interference (RNAi) vector of rat CXCR4 gene, three target sequences were selected according to rat CXCR4 mRNA sequence, the complementary DNA contained both sense and antisense oligonucleotides were designed and synthesized. After phosphorylation and annealing, these double-strand DNA were cloned to Bgl II and Hind III sites of pSUPER. Then the product pRiCXCR4 was confirmed by electrophoresis and sequencing. Next, CXCR4 shRNA was cloned to a transfer vector of lentivirus, pNL-EGFP, and pNL-RiCXCR4-EGFP was produced. It was confirmed by digestion and sequencing that CXCR4 shRNA expression structure was correctly cloned to pSUPER and pNL-EGFP respectively. Three plasmids, pNL-RiCXCR4-EGFP, pHELPER and pVSVG were cotransfected into 293T to package lentivirus particles. The functional titer of obtained virus was determined by flow cytometry after transduction in 293T, the resulting functional titer of unconcentrated virus and concentrated virus were 6.4×10

76049114916	A human microsatellite DNA-mimicking oligodeoxynucleotide with CCT repeats negatively regulates TLR7/9-mediated innate immune responses via selected TLR pathways	A human microsatellite DNA-mimicking ODN (MS ODN) composed of CCT repeats, designated as SAT05f, has been studied for its capacity of negatively regulating innate immunity induced by TLR7/TLR9 agonists in vitro and in mice. The result showed that SAT05f could down-regulate TLR7/9-dependent IFN-α production in cultured human PBMC stimulated by inactivated Flu virus PR8 or HSV-1 or CpG ODN or imiquimod, protect d-GalN-treated mice from lethal shock induced by TLR9 agonist, not by TLR3/4 agonist. In addition, SAT05f significantly inhibit IFN-α production from purified human plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) stimulated by CpG ODN. Interestingly, SAT05f could up-regulate CD80, CD86, and HLA-DR on the pDCs in vitro, implying that SAT05f-mediated inhibition on IFN-α production could be related to the activation of pDCs. The data suggest that SAT05f could be developed as a candidate medicament for the treatment of TLR7/9 activation-associated diseases by inhibiting TLR7/9 signaling pathways. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

76149106822	Effects of intra-articular injection of drugs for temporomandibular disorders	Objective: To compare effects of intra-articular injection of corticosteroid or viscoelastic agent alone or a combination of the two drugs for treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders. Methods: A prospective quasirandomized controlled trial was conducted to compare 3 treatment protocols of intra-articular injections in the upper compartment of the joint immediately following arthrocentesis repeatedly every 10 days: Circled digit 1 triamcinolone 8 mg alone for 3 times, Circled digit 2 1% hyaluronate 1 ml alone for 4 times, and Circled digit 3 triamcinolone 8 mg for 2 times then 1% hyaluronate 1 ml for 2 times. Clinical examinations were done at baseline, 1, 12, and 24 months after end of the treatments. According to improvement of the symptoms and clinical signs, the effectiveness was graded in 3 classes: excellent, better, no change, or worse. The first two were classified as effective. Effective rates of the treatments and subgroups were compared statistically. Results: Five hundred and sixty four patients with temporomandibular disorders were included and randomly allocated to 3 groups with 188 patients in each group. The rate of lost follow up at 24 months was 6.9% to 10.1%. At one month after treatment, the triamcinolone group had a better effective rate at 92.0%. At 12 and 24 months of follow up, effective rates of the hyaluronate group were better than those in the triamcinolone alone group (84.6% vs. 54.1% and 83.4% vs. 40.4%). Effective rates of combining triamcinolone and hyaluronate group at 12 and 24 months were 90.4% and 66.3% respectively. Conclusion: Intra-articular injection of corticosteroid has better results in a short term and hyaluronate has better results in a long term in the treatment of temporomandibular joint disorders. © 2009 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.

77952064406	Decreased level of recent thymic emigrants in CD4+ and CD8+T cells from CML patients	Background: T-cell immunodeficiency is a common feature in cancer patients, which may relate to initiation and development of tumor. Based on our previous finding, to further characterize the immune status, T cell proliferative history was analyzed in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients.Methods: Quantitative analysis of δRec-ψJα signal joint T cell receptor excision circles (sjTRECs) was performed in PBMCs, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+T cells by real-time PCR, and the analysis of 23 TRBV-D1 sjTRECs was performed by semi-nested PCR. Forty eight CML cases in chronic phase (CML-CP) were selected for this study and 17 healthy individuals served as controls.Results: The levels of δRec-ψJα sjTRECs in PBMCs, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased in CML patients, compared with control groups. Moreover, the numbers of detectable TRBV subfamily sjTRECs, as well as the frequency of particular TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with CML were significantly lower than those from healthy individuals.Conclusions: We observed decreased levels of recent thymic emigrants in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that may underlay the persistent immunodeficiency in CML patients. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953806894	Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome in mice after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and acute graft-versus-host disease	Objective: To explore the association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Methods: Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 → BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-α and IFN-γ) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Results: All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-α and IFN-γ levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-α levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-γ levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-α levels were higher but IFN-γ levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusions: The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD. T cells and TNF-α may play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD-induced IPS. IPS progression may be associated with decreasing lung IFN-γ levels. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Our results showed that MHSP65-TCL immunization significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer in mice and prolonged the survival of lung cancer bearing mice. In vivo and in vitro data suggest that MHSP65-TCL could induce specific CTL responses and non-specific immunity, both of which could contribute to the tumor inhibition. Thus, this report provides an easy approach to prepare an efficient TCL based tumor vaccine. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

Methods: The rat GDNF and TH genes were obtained with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The GDNF and TH genes were cloned into the lentiviral transfer vector which could be regulated by the improved TetOn system, in which tetracycline induced transactivator was rtTA2s-M2 and tracycline responsive element was mouse albumin gene promoter(Palb). Lentiviral supernatants were packaged through lentivirus four plasmids co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cell line-293T by Lipofectamine 2000. Then the virus titer was examined by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (real-time qPCR). The 293T cells were infected by obtained lentiviral-GDNF-TH and rtTA2S-M2 virus in the identical multiplicity of infection(MOI). The regulation expression of GDNF and TH mRNA and protein were examined by real-time qPCR and Western blot in different concentrations of doxycycline. Results: Tests showed that the recombinant lentiviral transfer vector plasmids were constructed correctly ; the titer of lentiviral vector particles was 2.1 × 10

78149374513	Inhibition of a C-rich oligodeoxynucleotide on activation of immune cells in vitro and enhancement of antibody response in mice	Summary: To explore the possibility that human mitochondrial genomic DNA-mimicking oligodeoxynucleotides could regulate the immune response, a series of mitochondrial DNA-based oligodeoxynucleotides (MTODNs) were designed and studied to determine their immunoregulatory effects on immune cells activated by toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. The results showed that a C-rich MTODN, designated MT01, was able to inhibit the proliferation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) and the production of type I interferon (IFN) from human PBMCs stimulated by TLR agonists, including inactivated influenza virus, imiquimod, inactivated herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and CpG ODNs. In addition, MT01 inhibited the CpG ODN-enhanced antibody response and this inhibition could be related to the antagonism of TLR9-activation pathways in B cells. Notably, unlike the G-rich suppressive ODNs reported, MT01 is composed of ACCCCCTCT repeats. These data imply that MT01 represents a novel class of immunosuppressive ODNs that could be candidate biologicals with therapeutic use in TLR activation-associated diseases. © 2010 The Authors.

78650138438	Primary solitary fibrous tumor of the vulva: A case report	BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the female genital tract is an extremely rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin. CASE: A case of primary SFT originated from the vulva of a 39-year-old woman. The tumor presented as a 10-cm, well-circumscribed lump and was composed of bland-looking cells admixed with thin and thick collagen fibers with the appearance of hemangiopericytoma. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were strongly positive for CD99 and vimentin, with focal positivity for CD34, and were negative for S100, SMA, desmin, ER, PR, etc. Microscopic evaluation and immunohistochemistry supported the diagnosis of a primary benign vulvar SFT. The patient remained well 10 months after excision. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first Chinese case of vulvar SFT in the Englishlanguage literature. SFT should be taken into consideration during the diagnostic process with spindle cell lesions of the vulva. The outcome of this tumor is based mostly on complete surgical resection. © Journal of Reproductive Medicine®, Inc.

78651061145	Generation of diffuse large B cell lymphoma-associated antigen-specific Vα6/Vα13+T cells by TCR gene transfer	Background. Our previous study had amplified antigen-specific full-length TCRα and α genes of clonally expanded T cells in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The transfer of T cell receptor (TCR) genes endows T cells with new antigen specificity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to generate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-specific T cells by T cell receptor (TCR) gene transfer. Materials and methods. Two different eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring TCR Vα6 and TCR Vα13 genes specific for DLBCL-associated antigens were constructed and subsequently transferred into human T cells using Nucleofector technique. The expression of targeted genes in TCR gene-modified cells was detected by real-time PCR, and western blot using TCR Vα antibody. The specific cytotoxicity of TCR gene-transferred T cells in vitro was estimated using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Results. Two different eukaryotic expression plasmids harboring TCR Vα6 and TCR Vα13 genes specific for DLBCL-associated antigens were constructed and subsequently transferred into T cells from healthy donors. Specific anti-DLBCL cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) could be induced by transduction of specific TCR gene to modify healthy T cells. The transgene cassette of TCR Vα13-IRES-TCR Vα6 was superior to the other in the function of TCR-redirected T cells. Conclusions. Specific anti-DLBCL cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) could be inducted by transduction of specific TCR gene to modify healthy T cells. © 2011 Yin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79951813621	Recombinant heat shock protein 65 carrying PADRE and HBV epitopes activates dendritic cells and elicits HBV-specific CTL responses	BCG Hsp65 and PADRE have been shown to be potent to enhance antigen specific immunity. In order to explore the possibility to utilize them for the development of HBV therapeutic vaccine, a chimeric protein, Hsp65-HBV, was created by fusing PADRE and epitopes from HBV to the carboxyl-terminus of BCG Hsp65 and expressed in E. coli. We evaluated its effects on human dendritic cell maturation and specific CTL induction in vitro. Results showed that Hsp65-HBV could activate human dendritic cells by up-regulating the expressions of HLA-A2, HLA-DR and CD86, companioning with high level of IL-12 secretion. Furthermore, Hsp65-HBV matured DCs could significantly stimulate human autologous CD8

79955002350	Frequency analysis of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs to characterize T-cell reconstitution in acute leukemia patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation	Background: Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) leads to a prolonged state of immunodeficiency and requires reconstitution of normal T-cell immunity. Signal joint T-cell receptor excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) are markers of developmental proximity to the thymus that have been used to evaluate thymic function related to T-cell immune reconstitution after HSCT. To assess the proliferative history in different T-cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamilies of T cells after HSCT, expansion of TRBV subfamily-naive T cells was determined by analysis of a series of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. Methods: sjTRECs levels were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 43 Chinese acute leukemia patients who underwent allo-HSCT. Twenty-three TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs were amplified by semi-nested PCR. Sixteen age-matched healthy volunteers served as normal controls. Results: sjTRECs levels were low or undetectable in the first 6 weeks after allo-HSCT and increased after 8 weeks post HSCT; however, sjTRECs levels at week 20 post-HSCT were still less than normal controls. Frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in PBMCs from recipients at week 8 post-HSCT (29.17 ± 20.97%) or at week 16 post-HSCT (38.33 ± 9.03%) were significantly lower than those in donors (47.92 ± 13.82%) or recipients at pre-HSCT (45.83 ± 14.03%). However, frequencies of TRBV subfamily sjTRECs in recipients at week 30 post-HSCT (42.71 ± 21.62%) were similar to those in donors and recipients at pre-HSCT. sjTRECs levels in donors had a positive linear correlation with sjTRECs levels in recipients within 8-12 weeks post-HSCT. Patients with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or chronic GVHD had profoundly reduced TRECs levels during the first year post-HSCT. Frequencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in recipients at pre-HSCT, and the frequencies of BV22-BD1 sjTRECs in patients with GVHD were significantly lower than those in donors. Conclusions: Reconstitution of thymic output function resulted in a period of immunodeficiency, with low or undetectable TRECs after transplantation, although fludarabine-based dose-reduced conditioning regimens were used. GVHD could affect reconstitution of thymic output function and reduce sjTRECs levels and frequencies of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs. Low frequency of BV22-BD1 and BV23-BD1 sjTRECs might be associated with GVHD. © 2011 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79955805855	Protective effects of the intracerebral transfer of the lentiviral-mediated GDNF and TH bi-gene on the basis of improved Tet-on system in a rat model of Parkinson's disease	Aim: To study the protective effect of lentiviral-mediated rat glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) on the basis of improved Tet-on system gene transfer on dopaminergic neurons in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Recombinant lentivirus (Lv-TH-GDNF) carrying rat GDNF and TH genes and tetracycline response element containing mouse albumin gene promoter (Palb) together with tetracycline-controlled transactivator rtTA2s-M2 virus was injected into the left striate bodies SD rats. After that, the expression of GD-NF and TH genes was regulated by doxycycline. One week later, ipsilateral intrastriatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was to injury dopaminergic neurons. The neuroprotective effects of Lv-TH-GD-NF were evaluated by apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, immunohistochemistry assay of the tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons in the substantia nigra, and the measurement of dopamine level in the striatum by high performance liquid chromatography-electric chemical discharge (HPLC-ECD). RT-PCR and western blotting were performed to check the expression of Lv-TH-GDNF in the brain. Tests were compared with the PBS control group and the non-injected control group. Results: Tests showed apomorphine-induced contralateral turning effect was significantly reduced in Lv-TH-GDNF + rtTA2s-M2 + DOX-pre-treated rats as compared with PBS-pre-treated rats when measured at 4 weeks post lesion by 6-OHDA (P < 0.01), the expression of TH-positive cells in the lesioned substantia nigra and DA levels in the lesioned striatum were significantly higher in Lv-TH-GDNF + rtTA2s-M2 + DOX-pre-treated rats than that in PBS-pre-treated rats (P < 0.01), but both were significantly lower than that of in non-injected rats (P < 0.01). RT-PCR and western blotting showed the expression of exogenous GDNF and TH genes was significantly raised in the lesioned striatum in Lv-TH-GDNF + rtTA2s-M2 + DOX -pre-treated rats as compared with PBS-pre-treated rats. Conclusion: The results suggest that lentiviral-mediated rat GDNF and TH bi-gene on the basis of improved Tet-on system, which is intrastriataly transferred to be induced by doxycycline, can significantly retard progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of nigrostriatal system from 6-OHDA-induced injury, which shows that it has neuroprotective effect on the dopaminergic neurons of PD.

84855877959	An oligodeoxynucleotide capable of lessening acute lung inflammatory injury in mice infected by influenza virus	Infection of influenza virus could induce acute lung inflammatory injury (ALII) that was at least partially caused by excessive innate immune responses. To study whether down-regulating Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated innate immune response could lessen influenza virus-induced ALII, a microsatellite DNA mimicking oligodeoxynucleotide (MS ODN), named as SAT05f capable of inhibiting TLR7/9-activation in vitro, was used to treat mice infected with FM1 virus. In parallel, two MS ODNs confirmed with less or no in vitro activities, named as MS19 and MS33, were used as controls. Unexpectedly, SAT05f failed to lessen ALII in the mice, whereas MS19 significantly inhibited the weight loss and displayed dramatic effect on lessening the ALII by reducing consolidation, hemorrhage, intra-alveolar edema and neutrophils infiltration in lungs of the mice. Meanwhile, MS19 could decrease the mortality of influenza virus infected mice and down-regulate TNF-α production in their lungs. The data suggest that MS19 might display its therapeutic role on ALII induced by influenza virus by reducing over-production of TNF-α. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..

84862795041	Altered expression of the TCR signaling related genes CD3 and FcRI in patients with aplastic anemia	Background: Aplastic anemia (AA) is characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia, which results from immune-mediated hematopoiesis suppression. Understanding the pathophysiology of the immune system, particularly T cells immunity, has led to improved AA treatment over the past decades. However, primary and secondary failure after immunosuppressive therapy is frequent. Thus, knowledge of the immune mechanisms leading to AA is crucial to fundamentally understand the disease. Findings. To elucidate the T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction features in AA, the expression levels of CD3, , and chain and FcRI genes, which are involved in TCR signal transduction, and the negative correlation of the expression levels between the CD3 and FcRI genes in T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. Real-time RT-PCR using the SYBR Green method was used to detect the expression level of these genes in PBMCs from 18 patients with AA and 14 healthy individuals. The 2microglobulin gene (2M) was used as an endogenous reference. The expression levels of the CD3, CD3, CD3 and CD3 genes in patients with AA were significantly increased compared to a healthy control group, whereas the FcRI gene expression level was significantly decreased in patients with AA in comparison with the healthy control group. Moreover, the negative correlation of the expression levels between the CD3 and FcRI genes was lost. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the CD3, CD3, CD3, CD3 and FcRI gene expression in patients with AA. The abnormally expressed TCR signaling related genes may relate to T cells dysfunction in AA. © 2012 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

In this study, MF59 formulated with a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (YW002) was tested for its Th1 adjuvant activity to induce immune responses to HSP65-MUC1, a recombinant fusion protein incorporating a mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP65) and mucin 1, cell surface associated (MUC1) derived peptide. Combination of YW002 with MF59 (MF59-YW002) could confer a potent Th1 biasing property to the adjuvant, which enhanced the immunogenicity of HSP65-MUC1 to induce significantly higher levels of specific IgG2c, increased IFN-γ mRNA expression in splenocytes and the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mice. When prophylactically applied, MF59-YW002 adjuvant containing HSP65-MUC1 inhibited the growth of MUC1

84862813168	Discrepant roles of CpG ODN on acute alcohol-induced liver injury in mice	Increasing evidence suggests that the alcoholic liver injury is associated with activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the consequent over-production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of CpG ODN, a TLR9 agonist, on alcoholic liver injury. In this study, an animal model of acute alcohol-induced liver injury was established by administering the mice with alcohol at 7 g/kg intragastrically once. Using the model, 2216, an A-type CpG ODN, was found able to dramatically elevate serum ALT levels and aggravate pathological changes of liver in mice. In contrast, 2006, a B-type CpG ODN, caused elevation of serum ALT levels with no visible aggravation of liver pathological changes; YW002, a C-type CpG ODN, caused no elevation of serum ALT levels and seemed able to lessen pathological changes in the liver of the mice. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that 2216 dramatically up-regulated the expression of TLR9 and TNF-α and YW002 was unable to up-regulate expression of TLR9 and TNF-α, instead up-regulate the expression of IFN-α in the livers of the model mice. The data suggest that 2216 could aggravate alcohol-induced liver injury by inducing the up-regulation of hepatic TLR9 and TNF-α and that YW002 could alleviate the pathological changes induced by acute alcohol intake by up-regulating IFN-α, possibly. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862068666	Recombinant hepatitis b virus surface antigen formulated with b-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide induces therapeutic immunity against hepatitis b virus surface antigen-expressing liver cancer cells in mice	To develop a therapeutic vaccine against hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg)-expressing liver cancer, we tried to prepare a vaccine by formulating recombinant HBsAg with BW006, a B type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) with Th1-biasing activity, and examined its potency of inducing therapeutic immunity against HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells in mice. When applied therapeutically, BW006 could assist HBsAg to induce vigorous immune responses capable of inhibiting the growth of HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells and prolonging the survival of mice bearing HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments showed that the BW006-adjuvanted HBsAg enhanced the production of IgG2a antibodies, interferon-γ, and interleukin-12 and facilitated the generation of specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte that killed the HBsAg-expressing liver cancer cells. These results suggest that the BW006-adjuvanted HBsAg might be developed into a candidate tumor vaccine for the treatment of HBsAg-expressing liver cancer. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

84862832130	Overexpression of CXCR4 in mesenchymal stem cells promotes migration, neuroprotection and angiogenesis in a rat model of stroke	Background: Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its cognate receptor, chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4), are involved in the migration of stem cells. Aim: To test the hypothesis that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with genetically modified CXCR4 can promote their own recruitment around the ischemic core. Methods: Lentiviral vectors were used to overexpress the CXCR4-eGFP fusion protein (CXCR4/eGFP) or eGFP only (eGFP) or to introduce siRNA targeting endogenous CXCR4 (siRNA/eGFP) in rat mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs). Rats were injected with either the transduced rMSCs or PBS as a control via the femoral vein following a left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Results: One week after MCAO, immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant increase in the number of eGFP-positive cells surrounding the infarct areas in the CXCR4-rMSC-treated group compared to the rMSC-treated control group. Conversely, there was a significant reduction in the number of eGFP-positive cells in the siRNA-rMSC-treated group. Moreover, there was an increase in the capillary vascular volume of the peri-infarct area, a reduction in the volume of the cerebral infarction and improved neurological function in the CXCR4-rMSC-treated group compared to those in the rMSC-, siRNA-rMSC- or PBS-treated groups. Conclusion: CXCR4 overexpression in the rMSCs promoted their mobilization and enhanced neuroprotection in a rat cerebral ischemia model. This strategy may be a useful therapeutic approach for treating ischemic stroke. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862218426	Structure-activity relationship of a guanine-free oligodeoxynucleotide as immunopotent inhibitor	Excessive innate immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is required to develop agents to inhibit the overwhelming innate immune response. SAT05f, an inhibitory ODN with CCT repeat sequence found in human microsatellite DNA, has been demonstrated to down-regulate TLR7/9-mediated innate immune response, protect mice from D-GalN/CpG ODN induced lethal shock, and reduce anti-ssDNA antibody level in the lupus-prone mice induced by chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD). In this article, to explore the structure-activity relationship of SAT05f, we designed and synthesized a series of ODNs based on the sequence of SAT05f by changing repeat number of the CCT unit, substituting CCT unit with AAG at 3′ end or 5′ end or in the middle and by forming hairpin at 5′ or 3′ end, and tested their inhibitory effect on the CpG ODN induced proliferation and TNF-α production in murine immune cells. The results indicated that 1) at least 8 CCT units were required for a CCT repeat ODN to display its inhibitory activity; 2) CCT unit at 3′ end of SAT05f was necessary for its full inhibitory activity; and 3) 5′ end of SAT05f could be modified to design a more potent SAT05f derived inhibitory ODN. The data provided here would be helpful for finding a potent inhibitory ODN as a candidate medicament for the treatment of diseases associated with over-activated innate immune response. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863050471	Nanog inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by blocking NF-κB transcriptional activity in rat primary microglial cells	Nanog is an essential transcription factor maintaining the self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, which binds to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) proteins, inhibits their transcriptional activity and represses their pro-differentiation activity. The persistent and excessive activation of microglial cells, as primary immune cells in the central nervous system is associated with various nerve system diseases, such as neuropathic pain, ischemia, infection, as well as neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of Nanog on the activation of microglial cells have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether Nanog inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory factors in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglial cells. Nanog was shown to down-regulate the mRNA and protein levels of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglial cells. Furthermore, we also found that the transcriptional activity of NF-κB was dramatically reduced by Nanog, which was measured using luciferase assay. The results suggest that Nanog reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuates inflammatory responses in LPS-stimulated microglial cells by blocking the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Thus, Nanog may be a potentially useful anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of various nervous system diseases.

84863069977	Effects of immunotherapy on the distribution and clonality of TCR Vγ and Vδ subfamily T cells in allergic rhinitis patients	The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the peripheral specific IgE level, distribution of TCR Vg and Vd subfamily T cells and mRNA expressions of TCR Vg I-III following specific immunotherapy (SIT) with house-dust-mite extract in allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. Ten AR patients undergoing SIT with house-dust-mite extract for 1 year were recruited. Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence was performed to detect the serum specific IgE (sIgE) level before and after SIT; RT-PCR-genescan analysis was employed to detect the mRNA expressions of TCR Vg (I-III) and Vd (1-8) in the peripheral mononuclear cells followed by analysis of T cell clonality. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to detect the expressions of TCR Vg I-III genes. Ten healthy volunteers served as controls. For AR patients, SIT treatment could improve the symptoms, but the serum sIgE level was not markedly decreased. Before SIT, the expressions of TCR Vg I-III gene were similar between AR patients and controls (P>0.05) but markedly decreased after SIT in AR patients (P<0.05 in TCR VgI and VgII). The expressions of TCR Vd (1-8) before and after SIT were 5.3±0.82 and 4.9±0.57, respectively, and that in healthy controls was 5.2±1.40. Vd1, 2, 3 and 6 were the most common genes found in these patients. Significant difference in the TCR Vd6 subfamily T cells was found between the two groups. Polyclonal or biclonal proliferation was found in the T cells of patients before SIT and in healthy controls, but oligoclonal proliferation in only 1 subject before SIT. After SIT, the proportion of patients with oligoclonal proliferation of T cells (6/10) was markedly increased (P<0.05). SIT for 1 year could alter the expressions of TCR Vg I-III genes, the distribution of TCR Vg and Vd T cells and the ways in which T cells proliferate. The early improvement of symptoms following immunotherapy might not be related to the serum sIgE content in AR patients, but associated with the TCR gd T cells, especially the TCR V d6 T cells.

84868015040	Upregulated TCRζ enhances interleukin-2 production in T-cells from patients with CML	T-cell immunodeficiency is a common feature in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and deficiency in CD3 levels was detected in T cells from these patients, which may represent a characteristic that is related to a lower T cell activation. In this study, we explored the possibility that forced TCRζ gene expression may upreg-u-late T cell receptor (TCR) signaling activation and reverse interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in T cells from patients with CML. A recombinant eukaryotic vector expressing TCRζ was transfected into T cells by nucleofection. Phosphorylated TCRζ, phosphorylated NF-κB, and the IL-2 level in TCRζ-transfected CD3+T cells that were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies were measured by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Significantly increased TCRζ levels were found in TCRζ-transfected CD3+T cells. After CD3 and CD28 antibody stimulation, a significantly higher phosphorylated TCRζ chain level was demonstrated, and an increased IL-2 production in TCRζ- upregulated T cells was associated with the increased expression of the phosphorylated NF-κB. In conclusion, TCRζ gene transfection could restore TCRζ chain deficiency and enhance IL-2 production in T cells from patients with CML. It is possible that TCRζ chain reconstitution in leukemia-specific, clonally expanded T cells will effectively increase their activation of antileukemia cytotoxicity. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc..

84868261670	Effect of prophylactically applied CpG ODN on the development of myocarditis in mice infected with Coxsackievirus B3	Coxsackievirus B3 was one of the major pathogens causing viral myocarditis. Toll-like receptor 9 activation contributed to the innate immune response in the process of CVB3-induced myocarditis. In order to find out how CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, known as a TLR-9 agonist, would affect the CVB3-induced myocarditis, we chose a C-type CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (YW002) injected to the mice one day before CVB3 challenge. On day 4 post CVB3 infection, 3 mice in each group were randomly sacrificed and their hearts were isolated to detect CVB3 replication. On day 10, the CVB3 neutralizing antibody and inflammatory change of the hearts were detected. The results indicated that the CVB3-induced myocarditis was aggravated with the declining body weight of mice, decreasing neutralizing antibody, and uncontrolling virus replication by injecting 20 μg YW002 per mouse. When adjusted the amount at 10 μg YW002 per mouse, there were no signs of aggravation in myocarditis. Plus, the mortality of the infected mice was reduced, the neutralizing antibody level was raised and the replication of virus was restrained. These results suggested that a proper amount of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide application could help to inhibit CVB3 infection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84872607115	The association between absent lunula and depression in depressive outpatients: A case-control study	Absent lunula can progressively develop in a person who previously had a normal-sized lunula and can be associated with various systemic disorders. In this case-control study we hypothesised that absent lunula is associated with depression. The study comprised 332 depressive outpatients as well as 367 age- and sex-matched controls, all of whom were assessed and screened by the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). The presence of absent lunula in all fingers except the little finger on the right hand of subjects was examined and the number of absent lunula was calculated as 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. It was revealed that there was no significant difference in age and gender between controls and depressive outpatients. In the order of 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 absent lunula, the percentages were 68.1, 7.4, 9.5, 5.2 and 9.8 in controls, while it was 17.2, 15.4, 22.3, 21.4 and 23.7 in depressive outpatients with significant difference while they were 17.2, 15.4, 22.3, 21.4 and 23.7 in depressive outpatients, significantly different compared with controls. Logistic regression analysis on depressive outpatients indicated that severe depression was not associated with age and sex but markedly associated with number of absent lunula. Our study found that depression was associated with absent lunula, and severe depression was associated with a greater number of absent lunula. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84872316756	Alternative expression of TCRζ related genes in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia	A previous study has demonstrated a significant decrease in the TCRζ gene expression level in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); thus, we further investigated the expression of TCRζ-regulating factors, the distribution of the TCRζ 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) splice variants, and the expression level and correlation of the alternative splicing factor/splicing factor 2 (ASF/SF-2), FcεRIγ and ZAP-70 genes. TCRζ 3'-UTR splice variants were identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 14 healthy individuals, 40 patients with CML and 22 patients with CML in complete remission (CML-CR) by RT-PCR. The expression level of the TCRζ, FcεRIγ, ASF/SF-2 and ZAP-70 genes was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR. While the expression of TCRζ gene in the CML group was significantly lower than that in the healthy individual and CML-CR groups, a significantly higher expression of the FceRIγ and ASF/SF-2 genes was found in the CML group. Two types of splicing forms were detected in all of the healthy individual CML-CR cases: wild type (WT) TCRζ 3'-UTR and alternatively splieced (AS) TCRζ 3'-UTR which have been alternatively splieced in the WT TCRζ 3'-UTR. However, 35% of the CML cases contained only the wild type TCRζ 3'-UTR isoform. Based on the TCRζ 3'-UTR isoform expression characteristic, we divided the patients with CML into two subgroups: the WT

84872331771	CpG oligodeoxynucleotides with double stem-loops show strong immunostimulatory activity	Based on the current understanding of TLR9 recognition of CpG ODN, we have tried to design a series of CpG ODNs that display double stem-loops when being analyzed for their secondary structures using 'mfold web server'. Proliferation of human PBMC and bioassay for IFN production were used as technical platforms in primary screening. Interestingly, two of them, designated as DSL01 and D-SL03, belonging to B class CpG ODN and C class CpG ODN respectively, showed vigorous immunostimulatory activity and were chosen for further tests. Flow cytometry analysis showed that both of them could activate human B cells, NK cells, mononuclear cells and T cells and up-regulate expression of CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR on the surface of subsets in human PBMCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that those two ODNs potently stimulated proliferation of PBMC/splenocytes obtained from diverse vertebrate species. Noticeably, both of them displayed anti-breast cancer effect in mice when administered by peritumoral injection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84877910371	Alteration of the gene expression profile of T-cell receptor αβ-modified T-cells with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma specificity	Antigen-specific, T-cell receptor (TCR)-modified cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that target tumors are an attractive strategy for specific adoptive immunotherapy. Little is known about whether there are any alterations in the gene expression profile after TCR gene transduction in T cells. We constructed TCR gene-redirected CTLs with specificity for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-associated antigens to elucidate the gene expression profiles of TCR gene-redirected T-cells, and we further analyzed the gene expression profile pattern of these redirected T-cells by Affymetrix microarrays. The resulting data were analyzed using Bioconductor software, a two-fold cut-off expression change was applied together with anti-correlation of the profile ratios to render the microarray analysis set. The fold change of all genes was calculated by comparing the three TCR gene-modified T-cells and a negative control counterpart. The gene pathways were analyzed using Bioconductor and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Identical genes whose fold change was greater than or equal to 2.0 in all three TCR gene-redirected T-cell groups in comparison with the negative control were identified as the differentially expressed genes. The differentially expressed genes were comprised of 33 up-regulated genes and 1 down-regulated gene including JUNB, FOS, TNF, INF-γ, DUSP2, IL-1B, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL9, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL8. These genes are mainly involved in the TCR signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathways. In conclusion, we characterized the gene expression profile of DLBCL-specific TCR gene-redirected T-cells. The changes corresponded to an up-regulation in the differentiation and proliferation of the T-cells. These data may help to explain some of the characteristics of the redirected T-cells. © W. S.

84877921865	Allo-HSCT for acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage in adults: The comparison between standard conditioning and intensified conditioning regimens	Knowledge concerning the clinical and biological characteristics of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) is limited so that there has been a lack of uniformity in treatment. In this report, we retrospectively investigated the effect of intensified conditioning on adult ALAL undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). A total of 59 patients with ALAL (male in 37 cases and female in 22 cases) were consecutively enrolled in the data analyses. Twenty-four patients received the standard conditioning (total body irradiation (TBI) + cyclophosphamide (CY) or busulfan + CY protocol) and 35 received the intensified conditioning (TBI + CY + etoposide or fludarabine + cytarabine plus TBI + CY + etoposide protocol). Five-year transplant-related mortality was 17.6 ± 9.6 % and 25.5 ± 8.0 %, the 5-year overall survival (OS) post-transplantation was 23.8 ± 8.9 % and 64.0 ± 8.4 %, disease-free survival was 16.7 ± 7.6 % and 55.8 ± 9.4 %, the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 80.8 ± 8.5 % and 28.8 ± 9.9 %, respectively, in the standard and the intensified group (P = 0.380, P = 0.029, P = 0.005, and P < 0.001). Both univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the intensified conditioning regimen and acute graft-versus-host disease were favorable factors to reduce the relapse. The younger patients, patients with CR at the time of transplantation, and the intensified conditioning regimen were favorable factors to elevate the survival. In conclusion, intensified conditioning regimens followed by allo-HSCT might improve long-term survival and decrease relapse of leukemia in adult ALAL compared to the standard conditioning regimens. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is a non-classical class I molecule exerting multiple immunoregulatory functions. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) and GVHD after allo-HSCT. Methods: The sHLA-G levels were examined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in patients with hematological malignancies (n = 106) before transplantation, on days +15 and +30 after transplantation, as well as healthy volunteers (n = 10). Results: The levels of sHLA-G5, sHLA-G6 and sHLA-G7 in patients on days +15 and +30 after transplantation were all significantly higher than those before transplantation (all p ≤ 0.001). The increased levels of sHLA-G5 on days +15 and +30 after transplantation were both significantly higher in patients with grade 0-I acute GVHD (aGVHD) compared to those with grade II-IV aGVHD (both p < 0.001). The increased levels of sHLA-G5 on days +15 and +30 after transplantation were both negatively correlated with the severity of aGVHD (both p < 0.001). Conclusion: sHLA-G5 might be a predictor of the occurrence and severity of aGVHD, which may help to establish individual prophylaxis against aGVHD and improve the survival for patients after allo-HSCT.

84880026522	The evolution of malignant and reactive γδ + T cell clones in a relapse T-ALL case after allogeneic stem cell transplantation	Background: To improve the outcome of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), characterization of the biological features of T-ALL blast cells and the immune status of patients with T-ALL is needed to identify specific therapeutic strategies.Findings: Using a novel approach based on the combination of fine-tiling comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) and ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), we molecularly identified a malignant γδ + T cell clone with a Vδ5Dδ2Jδ1 rearrangement that was paired with a T cell receptor (TCR) VγI and comprised a Vγ1Vδ5 T cell clone in a relapse T-ALL patient. This malignant Vδ5 T cell clone disappeared after chemotherapy, but the clone was detected again when disease relapsed post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at 100 weeks. Using PCR and GeneScan analyses, the distribution and clonality of the TCR Vγ and Vδ subfamilies were examined before and after allo-HSCT in the patient. A reactive T cell clone with a Vδ4Dδ3Jδ1 rearrangement was identified in all samples taken at different time points (i.e., 4, 8, 68, 100 and 108 weeks after allo-HSCT). The expression of this Vδ4+ T cell clone was higher in the patient during complete remission (CR) post allo-HSCT and at disease relapse.Conclusions: This study established a sensitive methodology to detect T cell subclones, which may be used to monitor minimal residual disease and immune reconstitution. © 2013 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84881168615	Fully phosphorothioate-modified CpG ODN with PolyG motif inhibits the adhesion of b16 melanoma cells in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo	Adhesion to the extracellular matrix and endothelial lining of blood vessels is critical for tumor cells to grow at original or metastatic sites. Inhibition of tumor cell adhesion can be an antitumor strategy. Guanosine-rich (G-rich) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can inhibit the adhesion of certain tumor cells. However, no data exist on how inclusion of the CpG motif in the G-rich sequence influences tumor cell adhesion and subsequent tumorigenesis. In this study, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to evaluate how a panel of ODN-containing contiguous guanosines and the CpG motif influenced adhesion of B16 melanoma cells. The results showed that a self-designed ODN, named BW001, containing the polyG motif and a full phosphorothioate modification backbone could inhibit B16 melanoma cell adhesion on a culture plate or on a plate coated with various substances. In vivo data revealed that B16 melanoma cells co-administered with BW001 and intraperitoneally injected into mice formed fewer tumor colonies in peritoneal cavities. This effect was related to the polyG motif and the full phosphorothioate modification backbone and enhanced by the existence of the CpG motif. Additional in vivo data showed that survival of tumor-bearing mice in the BW001 group was significantly prolonged, subcutaneous melanoma developed much more slowly, and lung dissemination colonies formed much less often than in mice inoculated with B16 melanoma cells only. The effect was CpG motif-dependent. These results suggest that BW001 may exert an integrated antitumor effect. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84880783271	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood of patients with EBV-associated central nervous system diseases after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation	Background: To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of monitoring the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood for the patients with EBV-associated central nervous system (CNS) diseases after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), 172 patients undergoing allo-HSCT were enrolled in the study. Methods: The EBV DNA levels of blood were monitored regularly in recipients of transplants for 3 years post transplantation. The EBV DNA levels of CSF were monitored in patients with EBV-associated CNS diseases before the treatment and at different points following the treatment. Results: Post-transplant EBV-associated diseases developed in 27 patients, including 12 patients with EBV-associated CNS diseases. The 3-year cumulative incidences of EBV-associated diseases and EBV-associated CNS diseases were 19.5 ± 3.5% and 8.6 ± 2.4%, respectively. Patients with EBV-associated diseases showed higher loads of EBV DNA in their blood compared with patients with EBV DNA-emia. No difference was seen between the EBV DNA levels of blood in patients with CNS involvement and patients without CNS involvement. The EBV DNA loads of blood increased 3-14 days before the clinical manifestations of EBV-associated diseases emerged. The EBV DNA loads of CSF were higher than that of blood in patients with EBV-associated CNS diseases. In 12 patients with EBV-associated CNS diseases, EBV DNA levels were declining in both blood and CSF with the control of diseases, and the EBV DNA loads of CSF decreased faster than that of blood in 5 patients who responded to treatment, and the EBV DNA levels of CSF increased in 5 patients who were unresponsive to treatment. On multivariate analysis, the use of anti-thymocyte globulin and intensified conditioning regimens were independent risk factors for EBV-associated diseases and EBV-associated CNS diseases. Conclusions: EBV-associated CNS diseases are not rare after allo-HSCT. The EBV DNA loads of CSF could act as an important indicator, but the EBV DNA loads of blood could not, for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic evaluation of EBV-associated CNS diseases. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84883270757	Proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells via PPP2R5C down-regulation	Despite the success of imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains largely incurable, and a number of CML patients die due to Abl mutation-related drug resistance and blast crisis. The aim of this study was to evaluate proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction by down-regulating PPP2R5C gene expression in the imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cell lines K562, K562R (imatinib resistant without an Abl gene mutation), 32D-Bcr-Abl WT (imatinib-sensitive murine CML cell line with a wild type Abl gene) and 32D-Bcr-Abl T315I (imatinib resistant with a T315I Abl gene mutation) and primary cells from CML patients by RNA interference. PPP2R5C siRNAs numbered 799 and 991 were obtained by chemosynthesis. Non-silencing siRNA scrambled control (SC)-treated, mock-transfected, and untreated cells were used as controls. The PPP2R5C mRNA and protein expression levels in treated CML cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, and in vitro cell proliferation was assayed with the cell counting kit-8 method. The morphology and percentage of apoptosis were revealed by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry (FCM). The results demonstrated that both siRNAs had the best silencing results after nucleofection in all four cell lines and primary cells. A reduction in PPP2R5C mRNA and protein levels was observed in the treated cells. The proliferation rate of the PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated CML cell lines was significantly decreased at 72 h, and apoptosis was significantly increased. Significantly higher proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction were found in K562R cells treated with PPP2R5C-siRNA799 than K562 cells. In conclusion, the suppression of PPP2R5C by RNA interference could inhibit proliferation and effectively induce apoptosis in CML cells that were either imatinib sensitive or resistant. Down-regulating PPP2R5C gene expression might be considered as a new therapeutic target strategy for CML, particularly for imatinib-resistant CML. © 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

To confirm the role of PPP2R5C in proliferation and its molecular mechanism, three PPP2R5C-siRNAs and a scrambled nonsilencing siRNA control were used to treat Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells. After nucleofection, PPP2R5C expression and biological consequences based on a highly efficient and specific PPP2R5C-siRNA were demonstrated by qRT-PCR, CCK-8 assay, Annexin V/PI, and flow cytometry. The global gene expression profile of PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated Jurkat T cells was established. A significant reduction in the PPP2R5C mRNA level was observed at 24 to 72 h in Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells with all of the PPP2R5C-siRNAs. The proliferation rate of Molt-4 and Jurkat T cells transfected with different PPP2R5C-siRNAs was significantly decreased at 72 h compared with the control (p<0.05). However, the transfected cells did not show a significant increase in Annexin V/PI-positive cells (apoptosis). The highly efficient PPP2R5C-siRNA2 was used to treat Jurkat T cells for gene expression profile analysis. In total, 439 genes were upregulated, and 524 genes were downregulated at least twofold in PPP2R5C-siRNA-treated Jurkat T cells. Changes in signaling pathway genes closely related to the TCR, Wnt, calcium, MAPK, and p53 signaling pathways were observed. In conclusion, the suppression of PPP2R5C by RNA interference could effectively inhibit the proliferation of leukemic T cells, the PPP2R5C-siRNA treatment altered gene expression profiles, and the differential expression of the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), and Mdm2 p53 binding protein homolog (MDM2) genes may play an important role in the effects of PPP2R5C knockdown in Jurkat T cells. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84885061879	Changes in crystalline structure of microspheres of corn starch and amylose under isothermal and temperature cycling treatments	Microspheres of corn starch and amylose were prepared by precipitating starch paste solution with absolute ethanol. The V-type crystalline structure was observed in the obtained microspheres. By storing the microspheres at three temperature conditions under 95% RH, constant temperatures at 8. °C and 30. °C as well as temperature cycles at 8. °C for 1 day and at 30. °C for 1 day, for different periods of time, changes in crystalline structure of the microspheres were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The results showed that the diffraction peaks of V-type crystalline structure vanished after the temperature treatments. Retrogradation yielding A-type crystalline structure took place in all the corn starch microspheres and only the amylose microspheres with 8. °C/30. °C treatment. Comparing with the isothermal treatments, the temperature cycling accelerated retrogradation of the microspheres. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888161200	Molecular mimicry of murine pancreas by HSP65-MUC1	Objective: To explore the possibility to damage mice pancreas by recombinant fusion protein vaccine, heat shock protein 65-mucin 1 (HSP65-MUC1) via molecular mimicry. Methods: 21 C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into three groups: PBS control, HSP65 and HSP65-MUC1 groups. The mice in each group were injected underneath with PBS, HSP65 and HSP65-MUC1, respectively, once a week for three weeks. The mouse pancreas were isolated under aseptic situation, the proliferation of specific lymphocytes was tested by flow cytometry, the pathological changes of mouse pancreas were detected with histo-pathological analysis. Results: By flow cytometry, compared with PBS and HSP65 groups, the lymphocytes specific to HSP65-MUC1 of mice in HSP65-MUC1 group were increased by 16.88%(P<0.001), the lymphocytes specific to HSP65 were increased by 7.29%(P<0.01); the lymphocytes specific to HSP60 were increased by 5.79%(P<0.05). However, HE staining of mouse pancreas in immunized mice kept normal. Conclusion: The mouse pancreas are not injured by HSP65-MUC1 via molecular mimicry.

84888175223	Effect of BCG-derived HSP70 on immunogenicity of tumor cell lysate	Objective: To observe the effect of BCG-derived HSP70 (BCGHSP70) on the immunogenicity of tumor cell lysate and provide basis for the preparation of TCL-based tumor vaccines. Methods: B16TCL was prepared from B16 melanoma cells by freeze-thaw, then directly mixed with the recombinant BCGHSP70 in vitro to generate BCGHSP70-B16TCL. C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: BCGHSP70-B16TCL group, PBS group, BCGHSP70 group and B16TCL group. On days 1 and 14, the mice were injected subcutaneously with BCGHSP70-B16TCL, PBS, BCGHSP70 or B16TCL, respectively. On day 21, the mice were scarified and the splenocytes from each group were tested for their proliferative response to the stimulation of B16TCL in vitro by MTT assay, and the stimulation index (SI) of splenocytes was calculated. Results: B16 melanoma cells were lysed completely by freeze-thaw, and abundant proteins were observed in the B16TCL. BCGHSP70-B16TCL immunization resulted in a significant increase in the size of spleens. The SI of splenocytes was higher in BCGHSP70-B16TCL group than those in PBS group (P = 0.00), B16TCL group (P = 0.01) and BCGHSP70 group (P = 0.00). Conclusion: BCGHSP70 could enhance the immunogenicity of B16TCL, indicating that BCGHSP70 might be used as an effective adjuvant for the TCL-based tumor vaccine.

84892691206	Gene expression pattern of Treg and TCR Vγ subfamily T cells before and after specific immunotherapy in allergic rhinitis	Background: T regulatory cell (Treg) plays a critical role in respiratory allergy and allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT), and γδ T cells might participate in mediating Treg quantity and/or function in some immunological diseases. To further characterize whether γδ T cells could influence Treg in allergic rhinitis (AR) and SIT, we investigated the expression pattern of Treg's Foxp3 gene and γδ T cell receptor (TCR) Vγ subfamily genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of AR patients before and after SIT.Methods: Eighteen AR patients undergoing effective SIT with house dust mite extract for one year were recruited. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was applied to evaluate the severity. Immunofluorescence quantification analysis was performed to determine the serum specific IgE (sIgE) content. Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression levels of Foxp3 and TCR Vγ subfamilies. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited as the controls.Results: Nasal uni-VAS score after SIT was significantly lower than that before SIT, while serum sIgE content was similar before and after SIT. Expression levels of Foxp3 and TCR Vγ subfamilies in AR patients before treatment were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects. Expression levels of VγI and II were similar before and after SIT, while expression levels of Foxp3 and VγIII after SIT were significantly higher than those before. Before SIT, the significant positive correlation was observed between expression levels of Foxp3 and VγI, II, III, while negative correlation was observed between Foxp3, VγIII and VAS. After SIT, the significant positive correlation between expression levels of Foxp3 and VγIII and negative correlation between Foxp3, VγIII and VAS were observed.Conclusions: Treg and Vγ subfamily T cells were in a dynamic equilibrium in AR patients before and after effective immunotherapy for one year. The early improvement of symptoms following immunotherapy might be independent of the serum sIgE content in AR patients, but associated with the reconstitution of T cell immunity. © 2014 Zheng et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84891708144	The TCR γδ Repertoire and relative gene expression characteristics of T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells	Despite significant improvement in our understanding of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) biology and pathogenesis, many questions remain unanswered. In previous studies, we found a T-ALL case with two malignant T-cell clones with Vδ1Dδ2Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ3Jδ 2 rearrangements. In this study, we further characterized T-ALL cases with two malignant clones containing Vδ1Dδ3Jδ1 and Vδ2Dδ 1Jδ1 rearrangements using fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR), sequencing, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. We further analyzed the distribution and clonality of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vγ and Vδ subfamily T cells in the two T-ALL cases by RT-PCR and GeneScan. Monoclonal Vδ1 and Vδ2 subfamilies were confirmed in both samples, the Vδ3 through Vδ7 subfamilies could not be detected in the T-ALL samples, whereas the oligoclonal Vδ8 subfamily could be identified. Based on the clinical finding that both of the T-ALL cases with two malignant T-cell clones had a poor outcome, we attempted to compare the expression pattern of genes related to T-cell activation and proliferation between cases with the malignant Vδ1 and Vδ2 T-cell clones and T-ALL cases with a mono-malignant Vα T-cell clone. We selected two T-ALL cases with VαJα rearrangements and analyzed the expression level of Notch1, TAL1, and the CARMA-BCL10-MALT-A20-NF-κB pathway genes by real-time PCR. A20 had significantly higher expression in the biclonal compared with the monoclonal T-ALL group (p=0.0354), and there was a trend toward higher expression for the other genes in the biclonal group with the exception of TAL1, although the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, we identified two T-ALL cases with biclonal malignant T-cell clones and described the characteristics of the biclonal T-ALL subtype and its gene expression pattern. Thus, our findings may improve the understanding of biclonal T-ALL. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84896403319	Influence of hydrophilic amino acids and GC-content on expression of recombinant proteins used in vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease virus in Escherichia coli	Epitope-based protein expression in Escherichia coli can be improved by adjusting its amino acid composition and encoding genes. To that end, we analyzed 24 recombinant epitope proteins (rEPs) that carry multiple epitopes derived from VP1 protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus. High level expression of the rEPs was attributed to a high content of Arg, Asn, Asp and Thr, a low content of Gln, Pro and Lys, a high content of hydrophilic amino acids and a higher isoelectric point value resulting from abundant Arg. It is also attributed to the appropriate guanine and cytosine content in the encoding genes. The data provide a reference for adjusting the amino acid composition in designing epitope-based proteins used in vaccines and for adjusting the synonymous codons to improve their expressions in E. coli. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84895772702	Distribution and clonality of the Vα and Vβ T-cell receptor repertoire of regulatory T cells in leukemia patients with and without graft versus host disease	Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the main complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Recent data indicated that regulatory T (Treg) cells might relate to GVHD, and such functions might be mediated by certain T-cell receptor (TCR) subfamily of Treg cells. Thus, we analyzed the distribution and clonality of the TCR Vα and Vβ repertoire of Treg cells from leukemia patients with and without GVHD after allo-HSCT. Numerous TCR Vα subfamilies, including Vα1, Vα9, Vα13, Vα16-19, and Vα24-29, were absent in Treg cells after allo-HSCT. The usage numbers for the TCR Vα and Vβ subfamilies in Treg cells from patients without GVHD appeared more widely. The expression frequencies of Vα10 or Vα20 between both groups were significantly different. Moreover, the expression frequency of TCR Vβ2 subfamily in patients without GVHD was significantly higher than that in patients with GVHD. Oligoclonally expanded TCR Vα and Vβ Treg cells were identified in a few samples in both groups. Restricted utilization of the Vα and Vβ subfamilies and the absence of some important TCR rearrangements in Treg cells may be related to GVHD due to a lower regulating function of Treg subfamilies. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

84901629337	Optimization of corn starch succinylation using response surface methodology	Succinylation of corn starch was carried out through a dry process by using response surface methodology with four variables and five levels. A multi-linear regression method was chosen to fit the relationship between the response variable (y, the degree of substitution (DS)) and the four regressors (xi), i.e. concentration of sodium bicarbonate (x1), moisture content of reaction system (x2), reaction temperature (x3) and time (x4). A second-order model equation was obtained and then examined through experiments. The model adequacy was satisfactory as the coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.9103. The predicted optimal value for the DS was 0.150. The actual experimental results showed that DS and reaction efficiency (RE) were 0.151 and 93.25%, respectively. FTIR, XRD, and SEM were used to characterize the obtained succinate starches. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

84902190022	The feature of distribution and clonality of tcr γ / δ subfamilies T cells in patients with b-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma	Restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) V/Vβ repertoire expression and clonal expansion of β T cells especially for putative tumor-associated antigens were observed in patients with hematological malignancies. To further characterize the γδ T-cell immune status in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), we investigated the distribution and clonality of TCR Vγ/Vδ repertoire in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and lymph node (LN) from patients with B-NHL. Four newly diagnosed B-NHL cases, including three with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and one with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), were enrolled. The restrictive expression of TCR Vγ/Vδ subfamilies with different distribution patterns could be detected in PB, BM, or LN from all of four patients, and partial subfamily T cells showed clonal proliferation. At least one clonally expanded Vδ subfamily member was found in PB from each patient. However, the expression pattern and clonality of TCR Vγ/Vδ changed in different immune organs and showed individual feature in different patients. The clonally expanded Vδ5, Vδ6, and Vδ8 were detected only in PB but neither in BM nor LN while clonally expanded Vδ2 and Vδ3 could be detected in both PB and BM/LN. In conclusion, the results provide a preliminary profile of distribution and clonality of TCR γ/δ subfamilies T cells in PB, BM, and LN from B-NHL; similar clonally expanded Vδ subfamily T cells in PB and BM may be related to the same B-cell lymphoma-associated antigens, while the different reactive clonally expanded Vγ/Vδ T cells may be due to local immune response. © 2014 Liang Wang et al.
