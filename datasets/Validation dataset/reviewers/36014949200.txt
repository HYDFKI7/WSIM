84927136286	Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with adenocarcinoma of lung	Purpose: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a rare, immune-mediated entity. We present an unusual case of a patient who has double cancers and two different paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. Case Report: A 58-year-old gentleman has histories of adenocarcinoma of lung and malignant thymoma associated with myasthenia gravis, which underwent surgery and chemotherapy 3 years ago. This time, he presented to our ward with rapidly progressive memory decline and myoclonic jerks in his limbs for two weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain showed increased signal intensity over bilateral mesial temporal regions on T2 Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recover (FLAIR) series. Chest computed tomography showed cancer recurrence. He received steroid pulse therapy firstly and right lung lower lobe lobectomy later. Pathology report of the tumor was recurrent adenocarcinoma. After the immunotherapy and tumor resection, his mentality improved gradually. Six months later, brain MRI showed resolution of bilateral temporal hyperintensity with residual mesial temporal atrophy. Conclusion: From our case, we would like to emphasize that paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis should be considered among the differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia associated with myoclonus, along with other neurodegenerative diseases. Depending on its underlying malignancy, the cognitive impairment may be substantially reversible, despite atrophy of mesial temporal lobes.

8844224954	Does retrograde axonal atrophy really occur in carpal tunnel syndrome patients with normal forearm conduction velocity?	The cause of decreased median forearm motor conduction velocity (FMCV) in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is best ascribed to retrograde axonal atrophy (RAA); however, the relationships between the occurrence of RAA and electrophysiological or clinical severity remains controversial. We attempt to determine whether RAA really occurs in CTS patients with normal median FMCV and to investigate any relationships between RAA and severity of compression at the wrist. Consecutive CTS patients were enrolled and age-matched volunteers served as controls. We performed conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) and measured median and ulnar distal motor latencies (DML), FMCV, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, distal sensory latencies (DSL), and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) amplitudes. Furthermore, palmar median stimulation was done to calculate the wrist-palm motor conduction velocity (W-P MCV). Patients included for analysis should have normal FMCV and needle examination. We compared each electrodiagnostic parameters between the patient group and controls. The mean±SD of the W-P MCV for patients and controls were 33.26±6.74 and 52.14±5.85 m/s and those of median FMCV were 55.26±3.56 and 57.82±3.9 m/s, respectively. There was a significant reduction in the W-P MCV (36.2%, P<0.00001), significant decrease in the median FMCV (4.43%, P<0.00001) and SNAP amplitudes, and an increase of the DML and DSL in the patient group (P<0.00001) compared to the controls; however, there were no differences in median and ulnar CMAP amplitudes, ulnar FMCV and DML between the controls and patients. RAA and relatively slowed median FMCV do occur in CTS patients with normal median FMCV, regardless of severity of clinical manifestations and electrophysiological abnormalities.

21844438222	Hyperglycemia with occipital seizures: Images and visual evoked potentials	Purpose: Hyperglycemia may rarely be seen with visual seizures. Observation of both visual evoked potentials (VEPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in visual status epilepticus (SE) has not been reported. We describe acute and follow-up VEP and MRI findings of a patient with hyperglycemia-related visual SE of occipital origin. Methods: In a 59-year-old diabetic woman, complex visual hallucinations and illusions developed with ≤10 seizures per hour as an initial manifestation of nonketotic hyperglycemia. Results: Neurologic examination revealed ictal nystagmus to the right and continuous right hemianopsia. Ictal electroencephalography (EEG) and Tc-99m hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) revealed an epileptogenic focus in the left occipital lobe. MRI with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery showed focal subcortical hypointensity and gyral hyperintensity. Follow-up MRI showed only minimal gyral hyperintensity at 6 months. The P100 amplitude of VEP was significantly higher at the right occipital area during SE, but slightly higher on the left after the patient had been seizure free for 6 months. Conclusions: Occipital seizures and hemianopsia can be caused by hyperglycemia and may be accompanied by special MRI and VEP findings. © 2005 International League Against Epilepsy.

0030011744	Chorea-ballismus with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus	PURPOSE: To describe the neuroimaging (CT, MR, and single-photon emission CT [SPECT]) findings in a series of patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus and to correlate the imaging findings with the clinical presentation. METHODS: The neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus were evaluated. Family and drug histories, as well as other causes of chorea, were excluded. All 10 patients had CT, 5 also had MR imaging, and 3 had SPECT examinations. Three had follow-up CT and MR imaging studies, and MR findings were correlated with CT findings in 5 cases. Two experienced neuroradiologists, aware of the diagnosis but blinded to the clinical status of the patients, evaluated all images and reached a consensus as to the final interpretation. RESULTS: CT studies in 9 of 10 patients showed a hyperdense putamen and/or caudate nucleus; in 1, the CT findings were normal. T1- weighted MR images in all 5 patients who had MR imaging (including the patient with a normal CT study) showed hyperintense lesions without significant T2 signal alternation at the basal ganglia. In all 3 of the patients who had SPECT studies of the brain, the scans revealed hypoperfusion at corresponding areas. All 3 follow-up studies depicted resolution of the lesions in the abnormal basal ganglia. Increased hypointensity on T2-weighted and gradient-echo T2*-weighted images was also observed in the sequential MR images. In all patients, the initial side of involvement correlated well with the neuroimaging findings. The chorea resolved within 2 days after treatment of the hyperglycemia in 9 patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with chorea- ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus, CT and T1-weighted MR images show unilateral or bilateral lesions of the putamen and/or caudate. SPECT scans show hypoperfusion. These findings may be related to petechial hemorrhage and/or myelin destruction. Early recognition of these imaging characteristics may facilitate diagnosis of primary diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia and prompt appropriate therapy.

0030056571	MELAS syndrome associated with a tandem duplication in the D-loop of mitochondrial DNA	We describe a family with two cases of adult-onset mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome. Interestingly, the proband also had non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism. Endocrinological studies demonstrated a high titer of TSH receptor antibody in the proband and elevated levels in her maternal relatives. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) showed an A-to-G transition at nucleotide position 3243 in the tRNA(Leu(UUR) gene (A3243G) in the three generations of the family. Furthermore, a previously described -260 bp tandem duplication in the D-loop region of mtDNA was also found in the proband and her maternal relatives. To our knowledge, such kind of duplication has never before been reported in the MELAS syndrome. The proportions of mtDNA with the -260 bp tandem duplication and A3243G point mutation were 12.5% and 82% in the muscle, respectively, and 1.6% and 35% in the blood cells, respectively, of the proband. We conclude that the hyperthyroidism in this MELAS patient may be related to the tandem duplication in the D-loop of mtDNA. This study further substantiates the importance of searching for additional genetic mutations in mitochondrial encephalomyopathic patients with new clinical phenotypes.

0030768218	Putaminal petechial haemorrhage as the cause of chorea: A neuroimaging study	Objectives - A hyperintense putamen on either CT or MRI as a finding associated with chorea has occasionally been described and is almost always associated with non-ketotic hyperglycaemia. The cause of the hyperintensity of the striatum in these images is still controversial. Some reports have found that calcification was responsible whereas others have advocated petechial haemorrhage as the cause. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hyperintense striata are caused by petechial haemorrhage or calcification, with the sequential imaging changes. Subjects and methods - Five patients presenting with an acute onset of either hemichorea or generalised chorea and showed either unilateral or bilateral hyperdense striatum on the initial CT were assessed. Neuroimaging studies including sequential CT and MRI examinations and detailed biochemical tests were performed. Results - Three patients had pronounced hyperglycaemia and the other two patients had no biochemical abnormalities. In all patients, the first CT scans, performed within two weeks of the onset of chorea, showed a high density over the striatum contralateral to the chorea, which diminished or disappeared two months later. T1 weighted imaging disclosed hypersignal intensities over the striatum contralateral to the chorea on admission which diminished two months later, T2 weighted imaging at two months showed hyposignal intensity changes corresponding to the area with hypersignal changes on T1 weighted images, implying haemosiderin deposition. Conclusion - Based on the evolution of clinical manifestations and the findings of neuroimaging, putaminal petechial haemorrhage might be a new entity causing either hemichorea or generalised chorea.

0031723177	Oral drug of choice in carpal tunnel syndrome	Background: Conservative treatment of mild to moderate carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS) is variable. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of commonly used oral medications such as diuretics, nonsteroid anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and steroids in the treatment of CTS. Methods: Prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study of patients with clinical symptoms and signs of CTS, confirmed by standard electrodiagnosis. Baseline assessments included a standardized symptom questionnaire, rating five categories of symptoms (pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening) on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (severe). The total score in each of the five categories was termed the global symptom score (GSS). After baseline assessment, patients were randomized to the following treatment arms: 1) 4 weeks of placebo (n = 16); 2) 4 weeks of diuretic (trichlormethiazide, 2 mg daily; n = 16); 3) 4 weeks of NSAID-slow release (SR) (tenoxicam-SR, 20 mg daily; n = 18); and 4) 2 weeks of prednisolone, 20 mg daily, followed by another 2-week dosage of 10 mg daily (n = 23). Results of follow-up assessments in the second and the fourth weeks were identical to baseline scores. The changes in GSS were analyzed to determine the statistical difference. Results: No significant reduction from baseline GSS was seen at second, and fourth weeks in the placebo, NSAID-SR, and diuretic groups. However, the mean score at 4 weeks in the steroid group decreased significantly from a baseline of 27.9 ± 6.9 to 10 ± 7.4. Conclusion: For patients with mild to moderate CTS who opt for conservative treatment, corticosteroids are of greater benefit.

24344496948	Dynamic expression of Hsp27 in the presence of mutant ataxin-3	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. The molecular mechanisms underlying the selective neuronal death typical of MJD/SCA3 are unknown. In this study, human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with full-length MJD with 78 CAG repeats were assayed for the dynamic expression of Hsp27, known as a suppressor of poly-Q mediated cell death, in the presence of mutant ataxin-3 in different passages of cultured cells. A dramatic decrease of Hsp27 expression was observed in the earlier passage of cultured SK-N-SH-MJD78 cells, however, the later passage of cells showed a significant increase of Hsp27 to almost the same level of the parental cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of MJD transgenic mice and post-mortem human brain tissues showed increased expression of Hsp27 compared to normal control brain, suggesting an up-regulation of Hsp27 in the end stage of MJD. However, mutant cells of earlier passages were more susceptible to serum deprivation than mutant cells of later passages, indicating weak tolerance toward stress in cells with reduced Hsp27. While heat shock was used to assess the stress response, cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 displayed normal response upon heat shock stimuli when compared to the parental cells. Taken together, we proposed that during the early disease stage, the reduction of Hsp27 synthesis mitigated the ability of neuron cells to cope with cytotoxicity induced by mutant ataxin-3, triggering the cell death process during the disease progress. In the late stage of disease, after prolonged stressful conditions of polyglutamine cytotoxicity, the increased level of Hsp27 may reflect a dynamic process of the survived cells to unfold and remove mutant ataxin-3. However, this increased Hsp27 still cannot reverse the global dysfunction of cellular proteins due to accumulation of cytotoxic effects. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

26244466391	Rhabdomyolysis induced by fenoverine: A case report and literature review	Fenoverine is a derivative of phenothiazine. It is commonly used in the treatment of gastrointestinal and gynecological spasmodic disorders. Myalgia is a common side effect, but rhabdomyolysis has only been scarcely reported before. A 77-year-old patient without previous history of liver diseases received fenoverine therapy for four days due to abdominal pain. Acute onset of myalgia, proximal muscle weakness and high creatinine phosphokinase (CK) occurred. The foregoing symptoms and signs and abnormal biochemistry improved gradually after discontinuation of fenoverine use. The pathophysiology of fenoverine-induced rhabdomyolysis is unclear. Some predisposing factors, especially liver cirrhosis, had been reported. However, our patient had none of the well-known precipitating factors. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of rhabdomyolysis in patients receiving fenoverine, whether they are healthy or have musculoskeletal or liver dysfunction.

33646042575	Comparison of sensitivity of transcarpal median motor conduction velocity and conventional conduction techniques in electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome	Objective: To compare the sensitivity of median wrist-palm motor conduction velocity (W-P MCV) with those of standard sensory conduction techniques in the electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods: This study included 280 consecutively suspected CTS patients (360 hands) referred for evaluation and 150 volunteers who served as controls. We determined and calculated (1) median W-P MCV, (2) median motor distal latencies (DL) and median sensory DL for (3) thumb (D1), (4) index (D2) and (5) ring finger (D4), (6) median wrist-palm sensory conduction velocity (W-P SCV) and sensory conduction time (W-P SCT) for index finger and sensory latency differences between (7) median-radial (M-R) for thumb and (8) median-ulnar (M-U) nerves for ring finger. The normal limits were calculated from the median of normal controls ±2.5 standard deviations. The sensitivities of each test were determined and compared. Results: Among the 360 hands with suspected CTS, 32 hands (8.9%) had normal electrodiagnostic studies and 328 (91.1%) had at least one abnormal electrodiagnostic study. Among the 328 hands with abnormalities, 234 (65%) had abnormal motor DL and 294 (81.7%) had abnormal W-P MCV. The sensitivity was 80.3% for D1, 72.5% for D2, 76.7% for D4, 86.7% for M-R (specificity, 98.7%), 87.2% for M-U (specificity, 96.7%), 80.8% for sensory W-P SCT and 73.6% for W-P SCV. Conclusions: W-P MCV is a valuable motor conduction technique for the diagnosis of CTS and it is confirmed again that W-P MCV is equal to or more sensitive than W-P SCV and W-P SCT. Furthermore, the findings of the present study are in agreement with the conventional wisdom that internal comparison of latency differences between median and ulnar or radial nerves is the best method for a diagnosis of patients with suspected CTS. Therefore, we recommend that CTS patients be studied according to the following steps: (1) routine sensory and motor DL, (2) if step 1 is negative, then perform and determine W-P MCV or SCT. This may increase the diagnostic yield of 10%, (3) if step 2 is negative, measure the M-U or MR. These are the final and more sensitive techniques in making a diagnosis with an additional diagnostic yield of 10%. Significance: We provide the evidence of W-P MCV that could be a standard technique for electrodiagnosis of CTS. Furthermore, we make a reasonable flow chart and recommendation for electrodiagnosis of CTS for electromyographers. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

33744939765	Enhanced regeneration in injured sciatic nerve by human amniotic mesenchymal stem cell	Objective: Amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into neuronal stem cells in vitro. We evaluated using amniotic fluid MSCs to support or enhance the ability of the injured sciatic nerve to cross a nerve gap. Materials and methods: We created a 5 mm nerve defect in Sprague Dawley rats. One group received therapy with MSCs embedded into woven oxidised regenerated cellulose gauze (Surgical; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) and fibrin glue, while a control group received woven Surgicel and fibrin glue only. Evaluation methods included behavioural, electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies. Results: In gait analysis, the angle of the ankles in the treatment and control group were 46.4° (standard deviation [SD] = 15°) and 36° (SD = 8.2°), respectively, which was statistically significant (p = 0.045). Five of 10 treated rats (50%) demonstrated partial foot movement, while none of the control group had any movement. The percentage amplitude of muscle compound action potential in the experimental group was 43% (SD = 12.5%) compared to 29% (SD = 8.8%) in the control group (p = 0.038). The conduction latencies in the control and experimental groups was 2.5 ms (SD = 0.45) and 1.7 ms (SD = 0.47), respectively (p = 0.005). Histological examination demonstrated that 70% of the treatment group achieved a maximum axon diameter percentage across the nerve gap of greater than 50%, compared with 0% in the control group. There were no differences in direction of fibre growth and fibrotic reaction between the two groups. Conclusion: Amniotic fluid MSC can augment growth of injured nerve across a nerve gap. This effect may be due to neurotrophic or induction effects of the MSC interacting with Schwann cells. Further study is required to determine the underlying mechanism of this effect. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33947326912	Motor neuron disease-like syndrome secondary to trapped fourth ventricle and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid pathway	The trapped fourth ventricle is caused by occlusion of outlets of fourth ventricle, including cerebral aqueduct and foramina of Luschka and Magendie. It is an uncommon entity that mainly occurs in children with hydrocephalus after successful shunting of lateral ventricles. The most common etiologies of obstruction to outflow of the fourth ventricle are infection and hemorrhage. Typical manifestation of trapped fourth ventricle is posterior fossa syndrome. Here, we report a 22-year-old man with hydrocephalus developed after successful removal of traumatic subdural hemorrhage. After shunting of lateral ventricles, hydrocephalus resolved initially. However, trapped fourth ventricle occurred 9 months later. Unlike previous reports of trapped fourth ventricle, his presentation was motor neuron disease-like syndrome, including hand muscle weakness and atrophy, generalized brisk deep tendon reflexes, and absence of sensory deficits. Imaging study showed isolated dilatation of fourth ventricle and edema of cervical cord from obex to C7 level. After surgical decompression and lysis of adhesion of posterior fossa, neurological deficits well recovered. The pathogenesis of hand muscle atrophy is secondary to cervical cord edema caused by trapped fourth ventricle and obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway. Furthermore, the anterior horn cells and lateral corticospinal tract are located in the highly vulnerable region of spinal cord, either possibly due to venous engorgement or arterial insufficiency. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

35348921753	Post-injury regeneration in rat sciatic nerve facilitated by neurotrophic factors secreted by amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells	Amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells have the ability to secrete neurotrophic factors that are able to promote neuron survival in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of neurotrophic factors secreted by rat amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells on regeneration of sciatic nerve after crush injury. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were used. The left sciatic nerve was crushed with a vessel clamp. Rat amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells embedded in fibrin glue were delivered to the injured nerve. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocytochemistry were used to detect neurotrophic factors secreted by the amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells. Nerve regeneration was assessed by motor function, electrophysiology, histology, and immunocytochemistry studies. Positive CD29/44, and negative CD11b/45, as well as high levels of expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) were demonstrated in amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells. Motor function recovery, the compound muscle action potential, and nerve conduction latency showed significant improvement in rats treated with amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells. ELISA measurement in retrieved nerves displayed statistically significant elevation of CNTF and NT-3. The immunocytochemical studies demonstrated positive staining for NT-3 and CNTF in transplanted cells. The histology and immunocytochemistry studies revealed less fibrosis and a high level of expression of S-100 and glial fibrillary acid protein at the crush site. Rat amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells may facilitate regeneration in the sciatic nerve after crush injury. The increased nerve regeneration found in this study may be due to the neurotrophic factors secreted by amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

0034019257	Unusual signs for dural arteriovenous fistulas with diffuse basal ganglia and cerebral calcification	We present a case of multiple dural arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) in a 60-year-old man with the chief complaint of worsening headache, altered mental status and progressively unsteady gait over the course of one year. Computerized tomography revealed diffuse, symmetric calcification in the bilateral basal ganglia and bilateral periventricular and subcortical white matter. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple, enhanced, punctate and linear vessels. These images were due to reflux into the parenchymal veins in the dural AVF of the superior sagittal sinus within the basal ganglia and deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. Cerebral angiography disclosed multiple dural AVFs. The exact mechanism of basal ganglia and subcortical calcification is proposed to be an arterial steal phenomenon or persistent venous congestion, with calcification occurring in a chronic hypoperfused state or with dystrophic changes in the walls of congested veins.

0034212985	The cause of slowed forearm median conduction velocity in carpal tunnel syndrome	Objectives: Attempting to answer a debate concerning the etiopathogenesis of the decreased forearm median motor conduction velocity (FMMCV), we tried to use proximal stimulation at the wrist, elbow, mid-arm and axillary regions to determine segmental median motor conduction velocity (MMCV). We also correlated the FMMCV with median motor distal latency (MMDL) and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle in order to assess whether the conduction block of large myelinating fibers or retrograde axonal atrophy was the major cause of the decreased FMMCV. Background: The cause of the decreased FMMCV resulting from either the conduction block of the large myelinating fibers at the wrist or distal compression with retrograde axonal atrophy remains an unresolved issue at the moment. Animal models have supported the hypothesis that the retrograde axonal atrophy might also occur in humans. Other authors believe the standard FMMCV is calculated by subtracting the distal latency which may not represent an exact assessment of FMMCV but rather the velocity of small fibers that persist through the carpal tunnel. Subjects and methods: Patients with the clinical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) confirmed using standard electrodiagnosis were included. The patients were arbitrarily divided into two groups based on the FMMCV, one with reduced FMMCV (n=20, FMMCV < 50 m/s) and the other with normal FMMCV (n=35, FMMCV≥50 m/s). Age-matched volunteers served as controls. We explored motor conduction proximally at wrist, elbow, mid-arm and axillary stimulation, and recorded at the APB muscles. Based on the latency differences, we calculated the FMMCV, distal arm MMCV (DAMMCV) and proximal arm MMCV (PAMMCV), and compared the conduction velocity (CV) differences of DAMMCV-FMMCV, PAMMCV-FMMCV and PAMMCV-DAMMCV in the two patient groups and the control. Furthermore, we correlated FMMCV with MMDL and CMAP amplitudes of APB muscle because MMDL and CMAP amplitudes might reflect the integrity of the large myelinating fibers. Results: CMAP amplitudes of APB muscle at wrist stimulation and MMDL were not correlated with FMMCV in either of the two patient groups; however, the CMAP amplitude was markedly decreased and MMDL was significantly prolonged when compared with normal controls. The significant increase of CV gradient of DAMMCV-FMMCV and PAMMCV-FMMCV without an equal increase of CV gradient of PAMMCV-DAMMCV only occurred in the reduced FMMCV patient group, suggesting that the conduction block is not the primary cause. The CV gradient of DAMMCV-FMMCV and PAMMCV-DAMMCV did not show any significant difference between patients with the normal FMMCV and the control group. Conclusion: The retrograde axonal atrophy, not selective damage of the large fibers at the wrist, was the direct cause of the decreased FMMCV. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

38549104064	MPZ mutation G123S characterization: Evidence for a complex pathogenesis in CMT disease	OBJECTIVES:: To characterize the clinical and cellular phenotypes of a novel MPZ mutation identified in a Chinese family with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease type 1B. METHODS:: The family was evaluated clinically, electrophysiologically, pathologically, and genetically. The wild-type and mutant P0 fused with fluorescent proteins were expressed in vitro to monitor their intracellular trafficking. Adhesion assay was also performed to evaluate the adhesiveness of cells. RESULTS:: The novel MPZ mutation, c.367G>A, is associated with a late-onset demyelinating CMT phenotype with autosomal dominant inheritance. The median motor nerve conduction velocities of patients in this family ranged from 15.7 to 19.6 m/second. The neuropathologic studies from a sural nerve biopsy revealed a severe loss of myelinated fibers, and some onion bulb formation with clusters of regenerative fibers. Fluorescence analysis demonstrated that the mutant protein was retained ectopically in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Adhesion assay demonstrated a defective adhesiveness of cells expressing the mutant P0G123S protein. CONCLUSION:: The novel P0G123S mutation is associated with typical findings of late-onset demyelinating polyneuropathy in the electrophysiologic and pathologic studies, putatively resulting from aberrant intracellular trafficking of the mutant P0 protein, which compromises the adhesiveness of the cells. ©2008AAN Enterprises, Inc.

34247527366	Post-irradiation myokymia and neuromyotonia in unilateral tongue and mentalis muscles: Report of a case	We report a 52-year-old man with slowly progressive dysarthria and dysphagia for about 11 years after radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Neurological examination revealed atrophy and myokymia on the left side of the tongue and in the left mentalis muscles. Electrical discharges of myokymia and neuromyotonia were also observed in the aforementioned muscles, suggesting increased motor axonal membrane excitability involving the left hypoglossal nerve and the marginal mendibular branch of the left facial nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain did not show any evidence of tumor recurrence, indicating that irradiation probably plays an important role in pathogenesis. Focal myokymia with concomitant neuromyotonia in unilateral tongue and mentalis muscles could be an unusual delayed manifestation after radiation therapy.

84861529024	Electrophysiological characterization of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A in Taiwan	Background: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A) is the most common type of hereditary neuropathy. The demyelinating pathology of CMT1A results in significant nerve conduction slowing such that a nerve conduction study (NCS) is important in the clinical assessment of CMT1A. In this study, we analyzed and reported the electrophysiological features of a large Taiwanese cohort with CMT1A. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the NCS data of 106 Taiwanese patients with CMT1A. We also compared the electrophysiological parameters of the CMT1A patients with those of 20 patients with early-onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B). Results: The patients with CMT1A had a significant but variable degree of slowed nerve conduction. The median motor nerve conduction velocities (MNCVs) varied from 10.0 to 37.3. m/s in the entire CMT1A cohort but were more concordant in patients within a family (. p<. 0.001). In each patient, the MNCVs among different nerves were concordant (. p<. 0.001), and the MNCVs tended to remain steady longitudinally. Moreover, younger patients had a slower MNCV than older patients within the CMT1A population (. p<. 0.001). The average median MNCV was significantly faster in the CMT1A patients than in the CMT1B patients (21.8. ±. 6.2. m/s and 16.3. ±. 3.6. m/s; . p<. 0.001). Conclusion: This study provides basic electrophysiological knowledge about CMT1A in Taiwan. The findings also suggest that the electrophysiological variability in the CMT1A cohort may be at least partially attributable to unknown genetic factors. These data emphasize the role of MNCV in the clinical assessment of CMT1A. A median or ulnar MNCV below 38. m/s can be a sensitive criterion for supporting the diagnosis of CMT1A. A median MNCV can sometimes help to distinguish CMT1A from CMT1B, and CMT1A should be considered in patients with median MNCVs near or above 24. m/s. Moreover, the MNCV may to some degree reflect the severity of CMT1A. © 2012.

43249094238	Bromism caused by mix-formulated analgesic injectables	Bromism, chronic bromide intoxication, can be caused by a variety of medicines, but bromism due to pain-relieving injectable medications has not been reported. In this study, the methods used were internet searching on bromide-containing injectables available in Taiwan and the first case report of bromism due to mixed-formulated injectable medication. Many analgesic/ antipyretic and antihistamine injections containing bromides are still being used in Taiwan. They contain sodium bromide up to 1000 mg/ampoule or calcium bromide up to 800 mg/amp. A 25-year-old female suffered from forgetfulness and unstable gait after long-term frequent injections of a preparation to relieve head and neck pain. Blood tests showed hyperchloremia (171 mEq/L) and a negative anion gap (-48.7 mEq/L). Serum bromide measured 2150 mg/L. She recovered completely in 3 days with saline treatment. Many bromide-containing injections are still being used in Taiwan. Clinicians should keep alert on this issue to avoid iatrogenic bromism or making misdiagnoses. © 2007 SAGE Publications.

Design: Cohort study with retrospective data analysis. Setting: Voice clinic of a tertiary medical center. Patients: Complete data for 45 patients diagnosed with idiopathic or iatrogenic UVFP. The LEMG was performed between 3 weeks and 6 months from the onset of symptoms. Main Outcome Measure: At least 6 months after symptom onset and 3 months after LEMG. Results: Thirteen subjects showed resolved vocal fold motion (29%), and 32 had persistent vocal fold paralysis (71%). According to the LEMG decision rules proposed by Munin et al in 2003, the predictive values for positive results, negative results, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LEMG were 78.9%, 71.4%, 93.8%, 38.5%, and 77.8%, respectively. We found the false-positive rate to be as high as 50% if LEMG was performed less than 2 months after symptom onset, and only 7.7% if LEMG was performed at least 2 months after symptom onset. After excluding 14 LEMG data recorded at less than 2 months, the predictive values for positive results, negative results, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of LEMG were 92.3%, 60%, 92.3%, 60.0%, and 87.1%, respectively. The predictive values of positive results and accuracy significantly improved without compromising sensitivity. Conclusion: This study confirms that LEMG is a clinically useful tool that can offer prognostic information for UVFP especially if it is done at least 2 months after symptom onset. ©2008 American Medical Association.

44649109635	Alteration of proximal conduction velocity at distal nerve injury in carpal tunnel syndrome: Demyelinating versus axonal change	The objective of this study was to determine the cause of median forearm motor conduction velocity (FMCV) slowing in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, due to either focal conduction abnormality over wrist or retrograde conduction slowing, and to decide whether the slowing is related to severity of compression or not. Fifty carpal tunnel syndrome patients confirmed by conventional nerve conduction study with abnormal electromyography of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were group 1, and 100 with normal electromyography, group 2. One hundred volunteers served as controls. In addition to conventional nerve conduction study of median and ulnar nerves, palmar stimulations for median mixed and motor nerves were also performed to calculate wrist-palm mixed nerve conduction time and motor conduction velocity (W-P MCV). For group 1, group 2, and control subjects, respectively, W-P MCV were 19.73 ± 7.65 (mean ± SD), 32.7 ± 6.83, and 52.75 ± 6.4 m/s, whereas median FMCV were 48.63 ± 8.32, 54.42 ± 2.11, and 57.86 ± 4.24 m/s. There was a significant reduction in the W-P MCV (62.6%, P < 0.00001) and a decrease in the median FMCV (15.95%, P < 0.00001) in group 1, and 38% reduction in W-P MCV (P < 0.00001) and 5.9% decrease in median FMCV (P < 0.00001) in group 2 when compared with controls, but ulnar FMCV and sensory nerve conduction study results did not, suggesting the reduction of median W-P MCV is not parallel with that of median FMCV in both patients groups. Furthermore, there is a poor correlation of median FMCV and W-P MCV in patient groups, implying conduction blockage of the large myelinating fibers at the wrist, leaving only slower axons to be measured, is not the likely cause of reduction of FMCV. In addition, the reduction of compound muscle action potential amplitude of abductor pollicis brevis muscle, conduction block at wrist and weak correlation of median FMCV and compound muscle action potential amplitude of abductor pollicis brevis exclusively occurred in group 1. Therefore, the retrograde conduction slowing really occurs among patients with carpal tunnel syndrome-markedly in those with abnormal electromyography and mildly in those with only demyelination. This finding counters conventional wisdom that nerve function changes only in segments distal to injured sites. Copyright © 2008 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.

47149095416	Unilateral carotid and vertebral artery dissections and contralateral subarachnoid hemorrhage in a postpartum patient	Postpartum arterial dissection combined with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is rare and its mechanism is uncertain. A 32 year-old woman had a delivery by cesarean section 12 days prior to admission to our hospital. From the first day of delivery, she breast-fed her baby, sitting with her head always turned to the right. Each feeding lasted around 2 hours. A bilateral throbbing headache began two days after childbirth, and intermittent numbness of the right face, chest and hand as well as weakness of the right hand developed nine days after giving birth. A physical examination revealed transient mild hypertension and right hemiparesis. Her cholesterol ranged from 204 to 263 mg/dl. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance angiography and duplex ultrasound disclosed left fronto-parietal junction SAH and dissections of the right internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral arteries. Our patient demonstrated (1) that postpartum arterial dissection was not limited to natural delivery, (2) postpartum SAH could occur with dissections of the contralateral extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, and (3) that turning one's head always to the same side during breast-feeding might be a risk factor for this unusual stroke pattern.

5344230698	Clinical findings of intracranial vertebral artery disease using magnetic resonance angiography	The vertebral artery lesion has a variety of clinical characteristics. We sought to clarify the clinical patterns and the location of the intracranial vertebral artery (ICVA) diseases according to analyses of images obtained using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). We studied vascular lesions, risk factors, symptoms, signs, and outcomes in 35 patients with ICVA disease (3 had bilateral occlusion; 9, unilateral occlusion; 6, bilateral stenosis; and 17, unilateral stenosis). The most common site of unilateral and bilateral lesions was the distal ICVA after the origin of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). We found accompanying basilar artery disease in 28.6% of patients with unilateral and bilateral ICVA disease. The majority of the ICVA lesions were associated with internal carotid arteries disease (48.8%). The common vascular risk factors were hypertension (71%), diabetes mellitus (34%), hyperlipidemia (31%), smoking (29%), and coronary artery disease (23%). Eighteen patients (51.4%) had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) only, 10 patients (28.6%) had TIAs before stroke, and 5 patients (14.3%) had strokes without TIAs. Most patients (80%) with TIAs, with or without stroke, had multiple episodes. Vertigo or dizziness, ataxia, limbs weakness and abnormal gait were the common symptoms and signs. At 6 months follow-up, 66.7% patients had no symptoms or only slight symptoms that caused no disability. Our data showed (1) the usual location of ICVA disease (occlusion or severe stenosis) was distal to PICA, especially near the vertebrobasilar junction; (2) the risk factors were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and coronary artery disease; (3) patients with ICVA disease had a high frequency of accompanying internal carotid, middle cerebral, or basilar artery disease; (4) vertigo or dizziness, and ataxia were the common symptoms and signs; (5) TIA was the most common clinical pattern; (6) the outcome was favorable, except in cases with bilateral ICVA occlusion.

56349105091	The role of forearm mixed nerve conduction study in the evaluation of proximal conduction slowing in carpal tunnel syndrome	Objective: A decrease of forearm median motor conduction velocity (CV) is a common electrophysiological finding in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), ascribed to two possible mechanisms: either conduction block or slowing of the fastest myelinating fibers in the carpal tunnel, or retrograde axonal atrophy (RAA) with retrograde conduction slowing (RCS). We hope to utilize both direct and derived forearm median mixed nerve conduction studies to clarify the mechanism of the decrease of forearm median motor CV in CTS. Methods: Seventy-five CTS patients and 75 age-matched control subjects received conventional motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of median and ulnar nerves and forearm median mixed nerve conduction techniques. First, direct measurement of forearm median mixed conduction velocity (Forearm mixed CV) and nerve action potential amplitude (Forearm mixed amplitude) was determined with recording at elbow and stimulation at wrist. Then, stimulating electrode was placed over palm and recording at elbow and then at wrist to calculate the derived Forearm mixed CV. Electrophysiological parameters, including direct Forearm mixed CV and amplitude and derived Forearm mixed CV, were compared between CTS patients and controls. Results: CTS patients had significantly prolonged wrist-palm sensory and motor conduction, significantly decreased forearm median motor CV, and normal ulnar nerve conduction. The direct Forearm mixed amplitude was significantly decreased in CTS patients. The direct Forearm mixed CV was similar in CTS patients and controls, but there was a significant decrease in derived Forearm mixed CV in CTS group. The difference between direct and derived Forearm mixed CV was significantly greater in the CTS, suggesting that direct and derived Forearm mixed CV represent CV from different nerve fibers, one passing outside carpal tunnel without undergoing RAA or the other through the carpal tunnel with occurrence of RAA. Conclusion: A decrease of direct Forearm mixed amplitude really occurs in CTS, implying that RAA and RCS will develop over proximal median nerve at distal nerve injury and the decreased forearm median motor CV is best ascribed to RAA and RCS. Furthermore, in CTS, the direct Forearm mixed CV measures the CV from undamaged nerve fibers without passing through carpal tunnel, resulting in the misinterpretation of the cause of proximal conduction slowing secondary to conduction block or slowing over the wrist. Significance: We provide a direct evidence of the occurrence of RAA and RCS that would explain the cause of proximal median nerve conduction slowing. However, the clinical significance of RAA and RCS is uncertain. © 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

59849111894	Combination of G-CSF administration and human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cell transplantation promotes peripheral nerve regeneration	Amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFS) harbor the potential to improve peripheral nerve injury by inherited neurotrophic factor secretion, but present the drawback of the short-term survival after transplantation. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has a diversity of functions, including anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. This study was conducted to evaluate whether G-CSF could augment the neuroprotective effect of transplanted AFS against peripheral nerve injury. The potential involvement of anti-inflammation/anti-apoptosis effect was also investigated. Peripheral nerve injury was produced in Sprauge-Dawley rats by crushing left sciatic nerve using a vessel clamp. The AFS were embedded in fibrin glue and delivered to the injured site. G-CSF (50 μg/kg) was administrated by intra-peritoneal injection for 7 consecutive days. Cell apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, motor function, and nerve regeneration were evaluated 7 or 28 days after injury. Crush injury induced inflammatory response, disrupted nerve integrity, and impaired nerve function in sciatic nerve. Crush injury-provoked inflammation was attenuated in groups receiving G-CSF but not in AFS only group. In transplanted AFS, marked apoptosis was detected and this event was reduced by G-CSF treatment. Increased nerve myelination and improved motor function were observed in AFS transplanted, G-CSF administrated, and AFS/G-CSF combined treatment groups. Significantly, the combined treatment showed the most beneficial effect. In conclusion, the concomitant treatment of AFS with G-CSF augments peripheral nerve regeneration which may involve the suppression of apoptotic death in implanted AFS and the attenuation of inflammatory response. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

62549113404	Population-specific spectrum of NOTCH3 mutations, MRI features and founder effect of CADASIL in Chinese	Background and purpose : Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a hereditary disorder caused by NOTCH3 mutations and characterized by recurrent subcortical infarctions, dementia and leukoencephalopathy. So far, most clinical, molecular and neuroimaging information has come from Caucasians. Therefore, we investigated the spectrum of NOTCH3 mutations and MRI features in CADASIL patients of Chinese origin on Taiwan. Methods : Mutational analysis of NOTCH3 exons 2 to 23 by direct nucleotide sequencing was performed in patients with clinically suspected CADASIL. MRI findings were retrospectively evaluated and scored using a modified Schelten's scale. Results : Nine different point mutations of NOTCH3 were identified in 21 unrelated patients. Intriguingly, 47.6 % were in exon 11, and 19 % in each of exon 4 and 18. R544C was very common and present in all patients with a mutation in exon 11. Many patients with NOTCH3 R544C share the same haplotype linked to the mutation using markers D19S929 and D19S411, which flank the NOTCH3. The sensitivity of T2-weighted MRI detecting anterior temporal abnormality was only 42.9 %. Furthermore, the neuroimaging evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was present in 23.8 % of the 21 patients. Conclusions : A population-specific mutational spectrum of CADASIL was found in the Chinese patients on Taiwan. The Chinese patients carrying NOTCH3 R544C may descend from a common ancestor. Anterior temporal hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI may not be a sensitive marker for CADASIL. ICH is a relatively common manifestation of CADASIL in East Asians, especially in the presence of hypertension. © 2009 Steinkopff-Verlag.

62849123060	The 'hot cross bun' sign in the patients with spinocerebellar ataxia	Background and purpose: The 'hot cross bun' sign (HCBS), typically seen in the patients with multiple system atrophy, refers to a cruciform hyperintensity in the pons on T2-weighted MRI. Little is known about its pathological basis and prevalence in other degenerative cerebellar diseases and healthy population. We investigate the frequency of HCBS in the patients with spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and healthy controls. Methods: The presence of HCBS on T2-weighted axial MRIs from 138 SCA patients (three SCA1, 35 SCA2, 76 SCA3, 18 SCA6, one SCA7, three SCA8, and two SCA17) and 102 healthy controls was evaluated retrospectively. Results: The overall prevalence of HCBS in the SCA patients is 8.7%, but the frequency varies in different subtypes: 25.7% in SCA2, 1.3% in SCA3, and none in SCA6 or healthy controls. Notably, one patient with SCA7 and one with SCA8 were also found to have HCBS. Conclusions: The differential list of HCBS should be expanded to include SCA7 and SCA8. The elucidation of frequency of HCBS in various SCA subtypes may help prioritize the genetic testing in late-onset dominant ataxia. © 2009 EFNS.

65349115452	The real role of forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity in the assessment of proximal forearm conduction slowing in carpal tunnel syndrome	The decrease of forearm median motor conduction velocity (CV) in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common electrodiagnostic finding in clinical practice and is possibly secondary to either conduction block at wrist or retrograde conduction slowing (RCS). This study is attempted to confirm the existence of RCS and to explore why this controversy occurs for a long time. Eighty CTS patients and controls were recruited. In addition to conventional electrodiagnosis, subjects received further electrodiagnostic protocol. First, a recording electrode was placed over the wrist and then at elbow with palm stimulation to calculate indirect forearm mixed nerve CV (forearm-mix CV) that represented real measurement of nerve fibers through the carpal tunnel. Then, direct measurement of forearm-mix CV was performed with recording at the elbow and stimulation at the wrist. CTS patients had markedly prolonged distal motor and sensory latencies and significantly prolonged wrist-palm sensory and motor conduction. There was a significant decrease in forearm median motor CV; however, there was no difference in ulnar distal motor latency and forearm motor CV. The mild decrease of forearm median motor CV was not proportional to the marked reduction of W-P MCV and there was no demonstrated conduction block at wrist, implying the reduction of forearm median motor CV is unlikely due to conduction blockage or slowing of the large myelinating fibers at the wrist and RCS really occurs over the forearm median nerve. In addition, the direct Forearm-mix CV was similar in CTS and controls; however, there was a significant decrease in indirect forearm-mix CV only in the CTS. Moreover, the difference between direct and indirect forearm-mix CV was significantly greater and poor consistency of direct and indirect forearm-mix CV in CTS, suggesting that direct and indirect forearm-mix CV represent CV from quite different nerve fibers. Therefore, we conclude that RCS really does occur in CTS and the direct forearm-mix CV reflects the CV of nerve fibers without damage in CTS. The misinterpretation and measurement of different components of forearm-mix CV results in the existence of this controversy till now. Copyright © 2008 American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.

67349102251	Human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells in combination with hyperbaric oxygen augment peripheral nerve regeneration	Purpose Attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and associated inflammatory cell deposits rescues human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFS) from apoptosis. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) suppressed stimulus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in blood-derived monocyte-macrophages. Herein, we evaluate the beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen on transplanted AFS in a sciatic nerve injury model. Methods Peripheral nerve injury was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats by crushing the left sciatic nerve using a vessel clamp. The AFS were embedded in fibrin glue and delivered to the injured site. Hyperbaric oxygen (100% oxygen, 2 ATA, 60 min/day) was administered 12 h after operation for seven consecutive days. Transplanted cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammatory cell deposits and associated chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, motor function, and nerve regeneration were evaluated 7 and 28 days after injury. Results Crush injury induced an inflammatory response, disrupted nerve integrity, and impaired nerve function in the sciatic nerve. However, crush injury-provoked inflammatory cytokines, deposits of inflammatory cytokines, and associated macrophage migration chemokines were attenuated in groups receiving hyperbaric oxygen but not in the AFS-only group. No significant increase in oxidative stress was observed after administration of HBO. In transplanted AFS, marked apoptosis was detected and this event was reduced by HBO treatment. Increased nerve myelination and improved motor function were observed in AFS-transplant, HBO-administrated, and AFS/HBO-combined treatment groups. Significantly, the AFS/HBO combined treatment showed the most beneficial effect. Conclusion AFS in combination with HBO augment peripheral nerve regeneration, which may involve the suppression of apoptotic death in implanted AFS and the attenuation of an inflammatory response detrimental to peripheral nerve regeneration. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

67649497692	Acupuncture in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome a randomized controlled trial	Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with steroid treatment in patients with mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as measured by objective changes in nerve conduction studies (NCS) and subjective symptoms assessment in a randomized, controlled study. Methods: A total of 77 consecutive and prospective CTS patients confirmed by NCS were enrolled in the study. Those who had fixed sensory complaint over the median nerve and thenar muscle atrophy were excluded. The CTS patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment arms: (1) 2 weeks of prednisolone 20 mg daily followed by 2 weeks of prednisolone 10 mg daily (n =39), and (2) acupuncture administered in 8 sessions over 4 weeks (n=38). A validated standard questionnaire as a subjective measurement was used to rate the 5 major symptoms (pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening) on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (very severe). The total score in each of the 5 categories was termed the global symptom score (GSS). Patients completed standard questionnaires at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks later. The changes in GSS were analyzed to evaluate the statistical significance. NCS were performed at baseline and repeated at the end of the study to assess improvement. All main analyses used intent-to-treat. Results: A total of 77 patients who fulfilled the criteria for mild-tomoderate CTS were recruited in the study. There were 38 in the acupuncture group and 39 in the steroid group. The evaluation of GSS showed that there was a high percentage of improvement in both groups at weeks 2 and 4 (P<0.01), though statistical significance was not demonstrated between the 2 groups (P=0.15). Of the 5 main symptoms scores (pain, numbness, paresthesia, weakness/clumsiness, nocturnal awakening), only 1, nocturnal awakening, showed a significant decrease in acupuncture compared with the steroid group at week 4 (P=0.03). Patients with acupuncture treatment had a significant decrease in distal motor latency compared with the steroid group at week 4 (P=0.012). Acupuncture was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Conclusions: Short-term acupuncture treatment is as effective as short-term low-dose prednisolone for mild-to-moderate CTS. For those who do have an intolerance or contraindication for oral steroid or for those who do not opt for early surgery, acupuncture treatment provides an alternative choice. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

67650156048	Dietary supplement with fermented soybeans, natto, improved the neurobehavioral deficits after sciatic nerve injury in rats	Clearance of fibrin and associated inflammatory cytokines by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is related to improved regeneration in neurological disorder. The biological activity of fermented soybean (natto) is very similar to that of t-PA. We investigated the effect of the dietary supplement of natto on peripheral nerve regeneration. The peripheral nerve injury was produced by crushing the left sciatic nerve with a vessel clamp in Sprague - Dawley rats. The injured animals were fed orally either with saline or natto (16 mg/day) for seven consecutive days after injury. Increased functional outcome such as sciatic nerve functional index, angle of ankle, compound muscle action potential and conduction latency were observed in natto-treated group. Histological examination demonstrated that natto treatment improved injury-induced vacuole formation, S-100 and vessel immunoreactivities and axon loss. Oral intake of natto prolonged prothrombin time and reduced fibrinogen but did not change activated partial thromboplastin time and bleeding time. Furthermore, natto decreased injury-induced fibrin deposition, indicating a tolerant fibrinolytic activity. The treatment of natto significantly improved injury-induced disruption of blood-nerve barrier and loss of matrix component such as laminin and fibronectin. Sciatic nerve crush injury induced elevation of tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-α) production and caused apoptosis. The increased production of TNF-α and apoptosis were attenuated by natto treatment. These findings indicate that oral intake of natto has the potential to augment regeneration in peripheral nerve injury, possibly mediated by the clearance of fibrin and decreased production of TNF-α. © 2009 W.

67651161885	Eye of the tiger-like MRI in parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy	Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) clinically presents as autonomic dysfunction with parkinsonian features. Parkinsonian features include bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, postural instability and poor levo-dopa response. Neuropathologically, MSA-P is characterized by selective neuronal loss and gliosis mainly affecting the putamen and caudate nucleus, substantia nigra, olivopontocerebellar pathway and intermediolateral cell column of the spinal cord. Therefore, the target of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is focused on signal changes or volume reduction on putamen, including putaminal slit, gliosis by diffusion studies and reduction of putaminal volume. There have been no reports describing clinical manifestations of MSA-P with imaging abnormalities over globus pallidus. Here, we describe three patients with typical presentations of MSA-P with autonomic dysfunction and disturbances of axial motor function with minimal appendicular symptoms, including postural instability and gait difficulties. MRI showed symmetrical hyperintensity over the center of globus pallidus surrounded by a mild low-signal rims at T2-weighted image that is similar to that of eye of the tiger sign except for the marked hypointense rims. Dopamine transporter scans showed symmetric reduction of uptake over bilateral basal ganglia. This is the first report concerning these unusual imaging findings in MSA-P patients and we believe there is a subgroup of MSA-P with clinical presentation of axial impairment and symmetrically abnormal signal changes of globus pallidus in MRI. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

69949136948	Escalated regeneration in sciatic nerve crush injury by the combined therapy of human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells and fermented soybean extracts, Natto	Attenuation of inflammatory cell deposits and associated cytokines prevented the apoptosis of transplanted stem cells in a sciatic nerve crush injury model. Suppression of inflammatory cytokines by fermented soybean extracts (Natto) was also beneficial to nerve regeneration. In this study, the effect of Natto on transplanted human amniotic fluid mesenchymal stem cells (AFS) was evaluated. Peripheral nerve injury was induced in SD rats by crushing a sciatic nerve using a vessel clamp. Animals were categorized into four groups: Group I: no treatment; Group II: fed with Natto (16 mg/day for 7 consecutive days); Group III: AFS embedded in fibrin glue; Group IV: Combination of group II and III therapy. Transplanted AFS and Schwann cell apoptosis, inflammatory cell deposits and associated cytokines, motor function, and nerve regeneration were evaluated 7 or 28 days after injury. The deterioration of neurological function was attenuated by AFS, Natto, or the combined therapy. The combined therapy caused the most significantly beneficial effects. Administration of Natto suppressed the inflammatory responses and correlated with decreased AFS and Schwann cell apoptosis. The decreased AFS apoptosis was in line with neurological improvement such as expression of early regeneration marker of neurofilament and late markers of S-100 and decreased vacuole formation. Administration of either AFS, or Natto, or combined therapy augmented the nerve regeneration. In conclusion, administration of Natto may rescue the AFS and Schwann cells from apoptosis by suppressing the macrophage deposits, associated inflammatory cytokines, and fibrin deposits.

70349835751	Electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome: Which transcarpal conduction technique is best?	Transcarpal conduction techniques are commonly used to be supplementary techniques to distal sensory and motor latencies (DSL and DML) in the electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, which transcarpal conduction techniques, or combination of techniques, are the most sensitive for the electrodiagnosis of CTS is unknown. To determine which transcarpal conduction technique is the most sensitive for the electrodiagnosis of CTS, we prospectively conduct this study. Study subjects were 100 patients with CTS and 50 controls. In addition to DSL and DML determinations, all subjects were evaluated using four transcarpal conduction techniques. These were (1) median wrist-palm sensory conduction time (W-Psen CT); (2) median wrist-palm mixed nerve conduction time (W-Pmix CT); (3) the difference of conduction time across wrist between median and ulnar nerves (W-Pmix M-U CT); and (4) median wrist-palm motor conduction velocity (W-Pmot CV). The sensitivities and specificities of these tests were compared. Ninety patients had one or more electrophysiologic abnormalities. The DSL and DML diagnostic sensitivities were 74% and 72%, respectively. Better sensitivities were obtained with W-Psen CT (82%), W-Pmot CV (81%), W-Pmix CT (78%), and W-Pmix M-U CT (79%). Compared between four transcarpal conduction techniques, there was no significant difference in sensitivity. Of 26 patients with CTS with normal DSL, additional electrophysiologic abnormalities were revealed with W-Psen CT (30.7%), W-Pmot CV (53.8%), W-Pmix CT (30.7%), or W-Pmix M-U CT (38.5%). When W-Pmot CV was compared with W-Psen CT and W-Pmot CV versus W-Pmix CT, calculated probabilities (P = 0.07) showed a clear trend toward statistical significance. Furthermore, of 20 patients with normal DSL and DML, five patients had abnormality for W-Psen CT, eight for W-Pmot CV, four for W-Pmix CT, and six for W-Pmix M-U CT. On the basis of the results, we concluded that the most simple and reliable transcarpal conduction for electrodiagnosis of CTS was W-Psen CT. The most sensitive technique was W-Pmot CV in subjects with normal DSL or with normal DSL and DML. Evaluation of transcarpal motor conduction affords a useful supplementary technique to W-Psen CT. © 2009 by the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society.

77955276229	Clinical characterization and genetic analysis of a possible novel type of dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease	A family of dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with eleven members, six of them symptomatic, was characterized clinically and genetically. The ages at onset ranged from 10 to 45. years, and the clinical severity varied from no symptom to being wheelchair-bound. The median motor nerve conduction velocities ranged from 16.5 to 45.7. m/s. Men were more severely affected. The sural nerve biopsies in two patients featured demyelinating changes. No mutation in PMP22, MPZ, GJB1, NEFL, LITAF, EGR2, MFN2, HSP27, HSP22, GADP1, YARS, and DNM2 genes was found in the proband. Haplotype analyzes excluded linkage to the previously reported dominant CMT loci. A genomewide screen with 400 microsatellite markers and multipoint linkage analyzes revealed that the highest LOD score was around 1.6 on chromosome 3q28-q29, suggestive of a weak but possible linkage at this locus. The results of this study implicate the existence of a novel genetic locus for this syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77955325170	Occipital lobe seizures related to marked elevation of hemoglobin A1C: Report of two cases	Occipital lobe seizures caused by nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH) have been reported in only a few cases and are not fully characterized. We report two cases of NKH-related occipital lobe seizures with high hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), epileptiform electroencephalograph (EEG) and MRI abnormalities. Both patients had moderate hyperglycemia (310-372 mg/dl) and mildly elevated serum osmolarity (295-304 mOsm/kg) but markedly elevated HbA1C (13.8-14.4%). One patient had a clinico-EEG seizure originating from the right occipital region during sleep. The other patient had an interictal epileptiform discharge consisting of unilateral occipital beta activity in sleep. None of the previously reported cases fulfilled the criteria of a nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar (NKHH) state, or showed any interictal beta paroxysms, spikes, sharp waves, or spike/sharp-slow wave complexes. We suggest that prolonged exposure to uncontrolled hyperglycemia, as indicated by HbA1C, rather than an acute NKHH state is crucial in the development of this peculiar seizure. We also suggest clinicians look for the presence of interictal focal beta paroxysms in addition to the usual epileptiform discharges while reading the EEG of these patients. © 2010 British Epilepsy Association.

79551611314	A randomized clinical trial of acupuncture versus oral steroids for carpal tunnel syndrome: A long-term follow-up	We prospectively followed up patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in our previous study for 1 year. A total of 77 consecutive patients with electrophysiologically confirmed mild-to-moderate idiopathic CTS were randomized and assigned into 2 treatment arms: 1) 2 weeks of prednisolone 20 mg daily followed by 2 weeks of prednisolone 10 mg daily (n = 39); and 2) acupuncture administered in 8 sessions over 4 weeks (n = 38). In the current study, the patients were further followed up at 7 and 13 months using Global symptom score (GSS) assessments and nerve conduction studies repeated again at 13 months. When comparing with baseline levels, the percentages of patients with treatment failure, moderate improvement, and good improvement were significantly different between the 2 groups at month 7 [10.5, 2.6, and 86.8% for the acupuncture group and 33.3, 7.7, and 59% for the steroid group, respectively (P = .014)] and month 13 [15.8, 2.6, and 81.6% versus 51.3, 0, and 48.7%, respectively (P = .002)]. The acupuncture group had a significantly better improvement in GSS, distal motor latencies and distal sensory latencies when compared to the steroid group throughout the 1-year follow-up period (P < .01). Furthermore, significant correlation was observed between changes of GSS (month 13-baseline) and all parameters of the electrophysiological assessments except for compound muscle action potential amplitude. Perspective: This article demonstrates that short-term acupuncture treatment may result in long-term improvement in mild-to-moderate idiopathic CTS. Acupuncture treatment can be considered as an alternative therapy to other conservative treatments for those who do not opt for early surgical decompression. © 2011 by the American Pain Society.

79951674159	How to make electrodiagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome with normal distal conductions?	The purpose of this study is to investigate which electrodiagnostic techniques are better in clinically diagnosed patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and patients with CTS with normal distal conduction study. A total of 230 clinically diagnosed patients with CTS and 100 normal control subjects were enrolled. All subjects were evaluated by eight electrodiagnostic techniques, including conventional conduction studies: median distal sensory latency and distal motor latency; short distance conduction studies across wrist, including wrist-palm sensory conduction time and wrist-palm motor conduction velocity; comparison of median sensory conduction across the wrist with radial or ulnar nerves in the same limb (median-radial sensory latency difference [M-R] or median-ulnar sensory latency difference [M-U]); and comparison of median wrist-palm and palm-index conduction, including distoproximal conduction time difference and distoproximal conduction time ratio. Normal limits were derived by calculating the mean ± 2 standard deviations from the data of the controls. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with 95% confidence interval of each test were calculated. In clinically diagnosed patients with CTS, M-R is the best diagnostic technique with significant difference in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.912) compared with other tests except that of M-U. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of M-R were 84.3%, 98%, 99%, and 73.1%, respectively. Further evaluation of patients with CTS with normal distal latencies also revealed the best diagnostic value of M-R and M-U with significance to other tests in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. In clinical practice, after conventional median distal sensory latency and distal motor latency studies, the authors suggest performing M-R or M-U studies instead of segmental conduction or comparative studies of median nerves in the patients with CTS with normal distal latencies.

79956275648	Sesamin ameliorates oxidative stress and mortality in kainic acid-induced status epilepticus by inhibition of MAPK and COX-2 activation	Background: Kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) was involved with release of free radicals. Sesamin is a well-known antioxidant from sesame seeds and it scavenges free radicals in several brain injury models. However the neuroprotective mechanism of sesamin to KA-induced seizure has not been studied.Methods: Rodents (male FVB mice and Sprague-Dawley rats) were fed with sesamin extract (90% of sesamin and 10% sesamolin), 15 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, for 3 days before KA subcutaneous injection. The effect of sesamin on KA-induced cell injury was also investigated on several cellular pathways including neuronal plasticity (RhoA), neurodegeneration (Caspase-3), and inflammation (COX-2) in PC12 cells and microglial BV-2 cells.Results: Treatment with sesamin extract (30 mg/kg) significantly increased plasma α-tocopherol level 50% and 55.8% from rats without and with KA treatment, respectively. It also decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) from 145% to 117% (p = 0.017) and preserved superoxide dismutase from 55% of the vehicle control mice to 81% of sesamin-treated mice, respectively to the normal levels (p = 0.013). The treatment significantly decreased the mortality from 22% to 0% in rats. Sesamin was effective to protect PC12 cells and BV-2 cells from KA-injury in a dose-dependent manner. It decreased the release of Ca

0036086411	Evolution of clinical electrophysiology in diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome	Median nerve entrapment in the wrist to palm segment produces a clinical syndrome known as carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). CTS is the most common entrapment neuropathy seen in electrodiagnostic laboratories. Standard motor and sensory conduction techniques are of established value in the diagnosis of CTS since the first report in 1950's. However, there are patients with symptoms and signs of CTS who remain difficult to diagnose using the standard electrodiagnostic techniques. How to increase the sensitivity of electrodiagnositic techniques appears to be the main topic afterward. Improvement of the diagnostic yield occurred in the early 1970s when latency was measured over the shorter segments across the wrist. In the following years, internal comparisons were introduced and appeared to be more sensitive than the methods used before. This article will review the strength and weakness of each method and will introduce new techniques in the electrodiagnosis of CTS.

0036095481	The cause of slowed forearm median conduction velocity in carpal tunnel syndrome: A Palmar stimulation study	Objectives: To elucidate the etiopathogenesis of decreased forearm median motor conduction velocity (FMMCV) in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), we used segmental stimulation at the palm, wrist and antecubital fossa to determine conduction block at wrist and calculate and compare the segmental median motor conduction velocity (MMCV) to determine the pathogenesis. Background: The cause of the decreased FMMCV in CTS remains unclear. Animal models have supported retrograde axonal atrophy as the cause. Some authors believe standard FMMCV, calculated by subtracting the distal latency, may not represent an exact assessment of FMMCV but rather the velocity of small fibers that persist throughout the carpal tunnel. Subjects and methods: Patients with clinical symptoms and signs of CTS which had been confirmed with standard electrodiagnosis, were included. The patients were divided into two groups: one with reduced FMMCV <50m/s (Group I, n=20) and the other with normal FMMCV>50m/s (Group II, n=40). Age-matched volunteers served as controls (n=60). We used palm, wrist and antecubital stimulation, and recorded compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes at the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle. Based on a ratio of the CMAP amplitudes obtained from wrist and palm stimulation (W/P ratio) and the latency differences, we calculated the W/P ratio and the across wrist MMCV (AWMMCV) and FMMCV and compared and correlated them between two patient groups. Results: There was no difference in median motor and sensory distal latency between Groups I and II. CMAP and sensory nerve action potential amplitudes were reduced in Group I compared with Group II, but the difference was only marginally significant. Four patients had a significant reduction of the W/P ratio in Group I, compared with 7 patients in Group II, which did not reach a significance. Sixteen patients (80%) in Group I demonstrated no conduction block. Furthermore, Group I showed significantly decreased FMMCV when compared with Group II; however, AWMMCV was not significantly reduced in Group I, suggesting that decreased FMMCV does not result from a decrease in AWMMCV. Conclusions: There was no significant motor conduction block and no correlation of the FMMCV and AWMMCV in CTS patients with a decrease of FMMCV, suggesting retrograde axonal atrophy, and not selective conduction block of the large fibers at the wrist, is the direct cause of decreased FMMCV in CTS. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0035743177	The role of autonomic neuropathy in the genesis of intradialytic hypotension	Background: Intradialytic hypotension is a frequent complication of hemodialysis. Some authors have pointed to autonomic neuropathy as a major cause of intradialytic hypotension. However, other authors have found no such association. Methods: Tilt-table test and time-domain measures of heart rate variation were used to determine autonomic function. Conventional nerve conduction studies (NCS) were also performed to assess whether intradialytic hypotension is associated with polyneuropathy and autonomic neuropathy. Results: The indidences of polyneuropathy confirmed by standard NCS were similar for the intradialytic hypotensive and normotensive subjects, implying that polyneuropathy is not strongly related to intradialytic hypotension. However, heart rate variation decreased significantly in intradialytic hypotensive subjects, suggesting that isolated autonomic neuropathy plays a major role in the pathogenesis of intradialytic hypotension. One of 9 intradialytic hypotensive subjects had normal autonomic tests and 2 of 18 normotensive subjects had abnormal autonomic function, implying that intradialytic hypotension is not caused by autonomic neuropathy alone. Conclusion: Autonomic neuropathy plays an important role in the genesis of intradialytic neuropathy. Tilt-table is easily performed and time-domain measures for heart rate variation are easily determined. Tilt-table test and time-domain measures provide useful information concerning autonomic function. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0036337653	Does direct measurement of forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity reflect actual nerve conduction velocity through the carpal tunnel?	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine whether forearm (wrist-elbow) mixed nerve conduction velocity (W-Emix) represents the actual nerve conduction velocity (CV) of nerve fibers passing through the carpal tunnel. Background: W-Emix is presumed to reflect the actual forearm CV through the carpal tunnel. However, it has been argued that W-Emix chiefly originates from the nerve fibers passing outside the carpal tunnel. Therefore, the direct measurement of W-Emix cannot be used to assess retrograde axonal atrophy in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Subjects and methods: Thirty patients with clinical signs and symptoms of CTS were recruited and the diagnosis was confirmed with standard electrodiagnosis. Fifty age-matched volunteers served as control. Recording electrodes were placed over the elbow and index finger for mixed nerve and sensory nerve conduction studies, respectively. Stimulation was applied at the palm and wrist for the measurement of mixed nerve wrist-palm CV (W-Pmix), wrist-elbow CV (W-Emix), and elbow-palm CV (E-Pmix). Stimulation was applied at the elbow, wrist, and palm for the measurement of wrist-elbow sensory CV (W-Esen), wrist-palm CV (W-Psen), and elbow-palm CV (E-Psen). Comparisons were made between W-Pmix and W-Psen, W-Emix and W-Esen, and E-Pmix and E-Psen. Results: Correlations between W-Emix and W-Esen, E-Pmix and E-Psen, and W-Pmix and W-Psen were good in the control. In the patient group, there was a strong positive correlation between W-Pmix and W-Psen, and between E-Pmix and E-Psen. However, W-Esen correlated weakly with W-Emix, suggesting that W-Emix chiefly represents the CV of fibers passing outside the carpal tunnel. Therefore, the direct measurement of W-Emix cannot be used to assess retrograde axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the reduction in W-Psen was more marked than the reduction in W-Esen, implying that a conduction block at the wrist is the least likely cause of proximal slowing in CTS. Conclusions: W-Emix does not reflect the actual CV of the nerve fibers passing through the carpal tunnel. In addition, retrograde axonal atrophy appears to be the primary cause of decreased forearm CV in CTS. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

0036655620	Stroke registry in Kaohsiung veterans general hospital	Background. Stroke ranks as the second major cause of death in Taiwan. For better understanding of stroke characteristics in southern Taiwan and to provide further information to other studies of stroke, we reviewed the clinical data of our in-patients with acute stroke. Methods. Patients who were admitted to our hospital due to acute stroke between January 1999 and December 1999 were enrolled in our study. We used a stroke registration form to collect clinical data, including laboratory data, stroke subtype, risk factors, neurosonographic result, treatment, related complications, and Rankin Scale. Chi-square test was used to compare clinical parameters among the stroke patients. Results. A total of 578 patients with acute stroke were enrolled in our study. Among 578 patients, 408 (71%) patients were of ischemic stroke and 170 (29%) patients were of hemorrhagic stroke type. In the ischemic stroke group, the prevalence rate of risk factors were hypertension (71%), intracranial arterial stenosis (41%), diabetes mellitus (37%), current smoking (30%), hyperlipidemia (30%), atrial fibrillation (15%) and extracranial carotid stenosis (15%). Hypertension (79%) and diabetes (17%) were also major risk factors in hemorrhagic stroke patients. The in-hospital case-fatality rate for ischemic stroke (8.8%) was less than that for hemorrhagic stroke (20.6%). Conclusions. The proportion of hemorrhagic stroke in our acute stroke patients was higher in comparison to western countries. Hypertension, diabetes, smoking and hyperlipidemia were major modifiable risk factors in ischemic stroke. Better control of such risk factors is an important issue in either primary or secondary prevention of stroke. In our study, intracranial arterial stenosis (41%) was more common than extracranial carotid stenosis (15%). The result was different from western stroke registration. The cause is worth further study.

81855187144	Acupuncture versus topiramate in chronic migraine prophylaxis: A randomized clinical trial	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of acupuncture compared with topiramate treatment in chronic migraine (CM) prophylaxis. Methods: A total of 66 consecutive and prospective CM patients were randomly divided into two treatment arms: 1) acupuncture group: acupuncture administered in 24 sessions over 12 weeks (n = 33); and 2) topiramate group: a 4-week titration, initiated at 25 mg/day and increased by 25 mg/day weekly to a maximum of 100 mg/day followed by an 8-week maintenance period (n = 33).Results: A significantly larger decrease in the mean monthly number of moderate/severe headache days (primary end point) from 20.2 ± 1.5 days to 9.8 ± 2.8 days was observed in the acupuncture group compared with 19.8 ± 1.7 days to 12.0 ± 4.1 days in the topiramate group (p < .01) Significant differences favoring acupuncture were also observed for all secondary efficacy variables. These significant differences still existed when we focused on those patients who were overusing acute medication. Adverse events occurred in 6% of acupuncture group and 66% of topiramate group.Conclusion: We suggest that acupuncture could be considered a treatment option for CM patients willing to undergo this prophylactic treatment, even for those patients with medication overuse. © 2011 International Headache Society.

83655212414	The mutational spectrum in a cohort of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 among the han Chinese in Taiwan	Background: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 (CMT2) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited axonal neuropathies. The aim of this study was to extensively investigate the mutational spectrum of CMT2 in a cohort of patients of Han Chinese. Methodology and Principal Findings: Genomic DNA from 36 unrelated Taiwanese CMT2 patients of Han Chinese descent was screened for mutations in the coding regions of the MFN2, RAB7, TRPV4, GARS, NEFL, HSPB1, MPZ, GDAP1, HSPB8, DNM2, AARS and YARS genes. Ten disparate mutations were identified in 14 patients (38.9% of the cohort), including p.N71Y in AARS (2.8%), p.T164A in HSPB1 (2.8%), and p.[H256R]+[R282H] in GDAP1 (2.8%) in one patient each, three NEFL mutations in six patients (16.7%) and four MFN2 mutations in five patients (13.9%). The following six mutations were novel: the individual AARS, HSPB1 and GDAP1 mutations and c.475-1G>T, p.L233V and p.E744M mutations in MFN2. An in vitro splicing assay revealed that the MFN2 c.475-1G>T mutation causes a 4 amino acid deletion (p.T159_Q162del). Despite an extensive survey, the genetic causes of CMT2 remained elusive in the remaining 22 CMT2 patients (61.1%). Conclusions and Significance: This study illustrates the spectrum of CMT2 mutations in a Taiwanese CMT2 cohort and expands the number of CMT2-associated mutations. The relevance of the AARS and HSPB1 mutations in the pathogenesis of CMT2 is further highlighted. Moreover, the frequency of the NEFL mutations in this study cohort was unexpectedly high. Genetic testing for NEFL and MFN2 mutations should, therefore, be the first step in the molecular diagnosis of CMT2 in ethnic Chinese. © 2011 Lin et al.

84863185133	Laryngeal electromyography-guided hyaluronic acid vocal fold injection for unilateral vocal fold paralysis - Preliminary results	Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using an injectable needle electrode to guide hyaluronic acid (HA) vocal fold injection (VFI) during laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). Study Design: Prospective study. Methods: From March to June 2010, 20 UVFP patients received LEMG examination at our clinic. Before completion of LEMG, 1.0 cc of HA (Restylane Perlane®; Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) was injected via a 26-gauge monopolar injectable needle electrode into paralyzed thyroarytenoid muscle. After injection, 20 patients completed 3-months follow-up and 16 patients completed 6-months follow-up. The data before, 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after injection, including the normalized glottal gap area (NGGA) from videostroboscopy, maximal phonation time (MPT), mean airflow rate (MAFR), phonation quotient (PQ), perceptual evaluation of voice (grade, roughness, breathiness, asthenia, strain [GRBAS] scale), Voice Handicap Index (VHI), and self-grading of choking (grade 1-7), were analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: All of the patients completed the procedure without complications. After injection, mean NGGA was significantly reduced from 8.28 units to 0.52 units (1 week), 1.79 units (3 months), and 1.36 units (6 months). The mean MPT was prolonged from 5.66 seconds to 11.73, 11.25, and 11.93 seconds, respectively. VHI was reduced from 76.05 to 38.10, 37.40 and 35.00, respectively. Other analyzed data (PQ, MAFR, GRBAS scale, and choking severity) also showed statistically significant improvement. Conclusion: LEMG-guided HA VFI provides UVFP patients with neuromuscular function evaluation and treatment in one step. This clinical technique is feasible, and the short-term results are satisfactory. © 2012 The Voice Foundation.

84864762353	PRRT2 mutations in paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with infantile convulsions in a Taiwanese cohort	Background: Mutations in the PRRT2 gene have recently been identified in patients with familial paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia with infantile convulsions (PKD/IC) and patients with sporadic PKD/IC from several ethnic groups. To extend these recent genetic reports, we investigated the frequency and identities of PRRT2 mutations in a cohort of Taiwanese patients with PKD/IC. Methodology and Principal Findings: We screened all 3 coding exons of PRRT2 for mutations in 28 Taiwanese patients with PKD/IC. Among them, 13 had familial PKD/IC and 15 were apparently sporadic cases. In total, 7 disparate mutations were identified in 13 patients, including 8 familial cases and 5 apparently sporadic cases. The mutations were not present in 500 healthy controls. Four mutations were novel. One patient had a missense mutation and all other patients carried PRRT2 mutations putatively resulting in a protein truncation. Haplotype analysis revealed that 5 of the 7 patients with the PRRT2 p.R217Pfs*8 mutation shared the same haplotype linked to the mutation. Conclusions and Significance: PRRT2 mutations account for 61.5% (8 out of 13) of familial PKD/IC and 33.3% (5 out of 15) of apparently sporadic PKD/IC in the Taiwanese cohort. Most patients with the PRRT2 p.R217Pfs*8 mutation in Taiwan likely descend from a single common ancestor. This study expands the spectrum of PKD/IC-associated PRRT2 mutations, highlights the pathogenic role of PRRT2 mutations in PKD/IC, and suggests genetic heterogeneity within idiopathic PKD. © 2012 Lee et al.

0037017776	Behavior, neurochemistry and histology after intranigral lipopolysaccharide injection	Inflammation and neuronal degeneration of the substantia nigra (SN) occur in Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied the effects of intranigral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection on adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Locomotor activity measurement, neurotransmitter determination and perfusion fixation for immunohistochemistry were done on the 7th day. Bilateral LPS injection increased locomotor activity 2- to 3-fold. In the SN, dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) decreased but the ratios dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/DA, homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT increased. In the striatum, DA, DOPAC, HVA, 3-methoxytyramine and epinephrine decreased but HVA/DA and 5-HIAA/5HT ratios increased. Unilateral LPS decreased dopamineric neurons ipsilaterally but increased contralaterally. This study provides the first evidence of behavioral hyperactivity, epinephrine suppression and neuronal plasticity in the LPS model of PD. © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

0037062621	Comparison of motor conduction techniques in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome	Objective: To compare the sensitivities of motor wrist-to-palm (W-P) conduction velocity and two median-ulnar motor latency differences with that of sensory W-P conduction velocity in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods: This study included 116 consecutive patients with CTS (160 hands) referred for evaluation and 100 volunteers who served as controls. Median motor and sensory nerve responses with wrist and palm stimulation allowed for the determination of motor and sensory W-P CV (W-P MCV and SCV). Two motor distal latency (MDL) differences between the median-thenar and ulnar-hypothenar (M-U) muscles and between the median-second lumbrical and ulnar-interossei muscles (2L-INT) were measured and calculated. The mean values of controls plus or minus 2.5 SD served as the normal limits. Results: Among the 160 hands with suspected CTS, 11 (6.88%) had normal electrodiagnostic studies and 149 (93.1%) had at least one abnormal electrodiagnostic study. Among the 149 hands with an abnormality, 139 (86.88%) had abnormal W-P MCV and 129 (80.63%) had abnormal W-P SCV. The sensitivity for 2L-INT was 77.5%, and it was 70% for M-U, 68.75% for median MDL, and 73.75% for sensory distal latency. Combining W-P MCV and W-P SCV allowed for the detection of abnormalities in 147 hands (91.88%) and yielded a markedly improved diagnostic rate compared with W-P SCV alone. Conclusion: Motor W-P conduction study is more valuable and no more difficult than sensory W-P conduction study for the diagnosis of CTS. In patients with suspected CTS in whom the results of conventional nerve conduction studies are normal, studying both motor and sensory W-P conduction increases the diagnostic yield.

0036903069	A randomised clinical trial of oral steroids in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome: A long term follow up	Objectives: To determine the efficacy of a two week and a four week course of oral steroids in the conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Methods: 109 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome were randomly divided into two treatment groups: (1) two weeks of prednisolone 20 mg daily followed by two weeks of prednisolone 10 mg daily (n = 53); (2) two weeks of prednisolone 20 mg daily and two weeks of placebo (n = 56). A symptom questionnaire was used to rate the five major symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (numbness, pain, weakness/clumsiness, tingling, and nocturnal awakening) on a scale of 0 (nil) to 10 (severe); the resulting global symptom score was used to evaluate the efficacy of treatment. Assessments were made at baseline and at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months. Electrodiagnosis was repeated at the end of the study to validate improvement. Results: In an intention to treat analysis at the end of the study, improvement in the four week treatment group was achieved in 66.0% of the patients after one month and in 49.0% at the end of the study; in the two week treatment group, the respective values were 48.2% and 35.7%. In the four week treatment group, 51% were considered treatment failures (including those lost to follow up, receiving surgery, or with mild or no improvement), compared with 64.3% for the two week group. Though the percentage improvement was higher in the four week group, the difference did not reach a statistical significance. Persistence of improvement was 74.2% in the four week group v 74.1% in the two week group, suggesting no difference in the long term effect. Efficacy analysis showed no significant difference in global symptom score reduction between the two groups. Follow up electrodiagnosis showed significant improvement in all measured variables except for the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. Conclusions: Short term low dose oral steroid are effective treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome. The dose of steroids and the duration treatment are not key determinants of efficacy.

0037507329	The reason for forearm conduction slowing in carpal tunnel syndrome: An electrophysiological follow-up study after surgery	Background: The exact cause of decreased forearm median motor conduction velocity (FMMCV) in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is still a subject of controversy. A conduction block or an axonal loss in the large myelinating fibers upon wrist compression, or retrograde axonal atrophy, is suspected. Methods: In order to attempt a determination of the cause, 10 patients with clinical symptoms and signs of CTS, confirmed using standard electrodiagnosis and with a slowed FMMCV <50m/s, were included in this study. Serial standard median motor conduction studies were performed at baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after endoscopic ligament release. Serial median motor distal latencies (MMDL), compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes, and FMMCV, were determined and compared. Results: Significant improvement in MMDL had occurred at the 1-week follow-up examination; however, no such improvement in FMMCV was observed. Furthermore, a significant increase in CMAP amplitude was evidenced beginning 4 weeks after surgery. The results revealed an improvement in median motor conduction, across the wrist segment, that did not parallel the increase in FMMCV, suggesting that a conduction block or axonal loss at wrist compression was not the likely cause of the decreased FMMCV. Conclusions: Retrograde axonal atrophy, not selective damage to the large myelinating fibers at the wrist, is the direct cause of decreased FMMCV in CTS. © 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

0038015513	Temporary cerebellar hypoperfusion with good outcome in cerebellitis	The relation between clinical outcome and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) results in cerebellitis has not been studied. A 63-year-old man developed cerebellar dysfunction with left emphasis one week after onset of cough. The only abnormality on analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was elevated protein (68 mg/dl). Magnetic resonance imaging was normal on the ninth day of ataxia. SPECT showed unilateral cerebellar hypoperfusion on the 13th day, but was normal on the 20th day. His gait improved a little by discharge on the 28th day and his tandem gait was only slightly unsteady six months later. This is the first evidence that normalization of cerebellar hypoperfusion in adult patients with cerebellitis is related to good outcome. Normalization of cerebellar hypoperfusion can occur in three weeks even when ataxia remains severe.

84884266352	Chinese medicinal formula (MHGWT) for relieving diabetic neuropathic pain: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial	Objective. To investigate the effects of modified Hungqi Guizhi Wuwu Tang (MHGWT), a formula that comprises Chinese medicinal herbs, in relieving neuropathic pain in diabetics. Method. Between March 2008 and April 2009, 112 participants were randomly assigned to either the MHGWT group, whose members received MHGWT (n = 56), or the control group, whose members received a placebo (n = 56). Diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP) was rated using the 15-item Short-Form Brief Pain Inventory (SF-BPI), the 17-item Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), the 13-item Modified Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MMNSI), and the 36-item "SF-36." Nerve conduction studies (NCSs) were performed before and after treatment. Results. After 12 weeks of treatment, the SF-MPQ and SF-BPI scores of the MHGWT group were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced and a significant difference between the groups was observed (P < 0.05). The levels of NCS in the MHGWT group were nonsignificantly (P > 0.05) reduced, and no significant difference in NCS level was observed between the groups (P > 0.05). Conclusions. MHGWT shows promise in relieving DNP and deserves further investigation. © 2013 Chia-I Tsai et al.

84885429183	Predicting prognostic factors in a randomized controlled trial of acupuncture versus topiramate treatment in patients with chronic migraine	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify predictive factors of outcome in patients with chronic migraine (CM) treated with acupuncture or topiramate in a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive CM patients were treated with either acupuncture (n=33) or topiramate (n=33) in a 12-week period. Data on potential predictive factors were collected at baseline, and secondary data analysis was performed to identify factors associated with treatment response. Treatment prognosis was defined as the change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks from the 4-week baseline periods. RESULTS: The median change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks for patients with higher baseline headache days (>20 d) was significantly greater than that for lower baseline headache days (≤20 d) (median±interquartile range: -12±2 vs. -10±1 d, P=0.01) in acupuncture group. There was a greater change in mean number of moderate/severe headache days per 4 weeks for high moderate/severe headache days (>20 d) than in low days (≤20 d) (-12±1 vs. -10±2 d, P=0.015) in acupuncture group. patients with throbbing symptoms had better prognosis with acupuncture than those without throbbing (-12±2 vs. -9.5±2.5 d, P=0.004). Higher score (>5 points) in the general expectations for improvement predicted better response in both treatment groups (>5 vs. ≤5 points: -12±2 vs. -9±2 d for acupuncture group; -10±3 vs. -7±4 d for topiramate group; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Some variables can predict outcome in acupuncture or topiramate treatment of CM patients. Identifying predictors of prognosis of both treatments for CM may help improve outcomes in future work. Copyright © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84885859984	Which nerve conduction parameters can predict spontaneous electromyographic activity in carpal tunnel syndrome?	Objective: We investigate electrodiagnostic markers to determine which parameters are the best predictors of spontaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methods: We enrolled 229 patients with clinically proven and nerve conduction study (NCS)-proven CTS, as well as 100 normal control subjects. All subjects were evaluated using electrodiagnostic techniques, including median distal sensory latencies (DSLs), sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), distal motor latencies (DMLs), compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs), forearm median nerve conduction velocities (FMCVs) and wrist-palm motor conduction velocities (W-P MCVs). All CTS patients underwent EMG examination of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle, and the presence or absence of spontaneous EMG activities was recorded. Normal limits were determined by calculating the means. ±. 2 standard deviations from the control data. Associations between parameters from the NCS and EMG findings were investigated. Results: In patients with clinically diagnosed CTS, abnormal median CMAP amplitudes were the best predictors of spontaneous activity during EMG examination (p<. 0.001; OR 36.58; 95% CI 15.85-84.43). If the median CMAP amplitude was ≤2.1. mV, the rate of occurrence of spontaneous EMG activity was >95% (positive predictive rate >95%). If the median CMAP amplitude was higher than the normal limit (>4.9. mV), the rate of no spontaneous EMG activity was >94% (negative predictive rate >94%). An abnormal SNAP amplitude was the second best predictor of spontaneous EMG activity (p<. 0.001; OR 4.13; 95% CI 2.16-7.90), and an abnormal FMCV was the third best predictor (p= 0.01; OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.20-3.67). No other nerve conduction parameters had significant power to predict spontaneous activity upon EMG examination. Conclusions: The CMAP amplitudes of the APB are the most powerful predictors of the occurrence of spontaneous EMG activity. Low CMAP amplitudes are strongly associated with spontaneous activity, whereas high CMAP amplitude are less associated with spontaneous activity, implying that needle EMG examination should be recommended for the detection of spontaneous activity in those CTS patients whose NCS reveals CMAP amplitudes between 2.1. mV and the lower normal limit (4.9. mV in the present study). Significance: Using NCS, electromyographers can predict the presence of spontaneous EMG activity in CTS patients. © 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

0041623007	Forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity: Questionable role in the evaluation of retrograde axonal atrophy in carpal tunnel syndrome	The objective of this study was to determine whether forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity (Fmix) reflects the real conduction velocity of forearm motor nerve (Fmot) and forearm sensory nerve (Fsen) fibers passing through the carpal tunnel. Forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity is presumed to be indicative of the conduction velocity of the median nerve over the forearm. Therefore, Fmix is used widely to assess the causes of slowing forearm conduction velocity in carpal tunnel syndrome. However. some authors claim that Fmix comes chiefly from the undamaged fibers in carpal tunnel syndrome, and thus cannot replace Fmot or Fsen in the evaluation of retrograde axonal atrophy. Patients with clinical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome confirmed with standard electrodiagnosis were included. Age-matched volunteers served as control subjects. Conduction velocities across the wrist and over the forearm were measured, including those of the wrist sensory (Wsen), wrist motor (Wmot), and wrist mixed nerves (Wmix); and forearm mixed (Fmix), forearm motor (Fmot), and forearm sensory nerves (Fsen). The authors compared and correlated Wsen, Wmot, and Wmix, and Fmix, Fmot, and Fsen respectively. The mean values of Wsen, Wmot, Wmix, Fmix, Fmot, and Fsen of the control subjects less those of corresponding conduction velocity of carpal tunnel syndrome patients were designated Wsen N, Wmot N, Wmix N, Fmix N, Fmot N, and Fsen N respectively and were compared and correlated again. Wrist motor nerve conduction velocity, Wsen, and Wmix were significantly lower in carpal tunnel syndrome patients, and Fmot and Fsen but not Fmix were reduced significantly when compared with control subjects. Mean wrist sensory nerve conduction velocity, Wmot N, and Wmix N; and Fsen N and Fmot N showed good correlation except for Fmix N, suggesting that Fmix reflects the conduction velocity of undamaged fibers in carpal tunnel syndrome. Forearm mixed nerve conduction velocity cannot replace Fmot or Fsen in the assessment of retrograde axonal atrophy in carpal tunnel syndrome. In the disease state, Fmix possibly represents the conduction velocity of the palmar cutaneous branch.

84900473754	Laryngeal electromyography findings of vocal fold immobility in patients after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background. The clinical features of vocal fold immobility (VFI) after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have seldom been reported. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) and tumor study findings to elucidate the common clinical features of patients who presented with VFI after radiotherapy for NPC. The LEMG signals obtained from the cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles were used to confirm superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury. Results. The medical records of 13 patients were reviewed and 11 of them had evidence of RLN injury. Six of the 11 patients also had SLN injury, indicating possible vagus nerve (VN) injury. Two patients had cricoarytenoid joint fixation without evidence of nerve injury. None of the nerve injuries were caused by skull base recurrence or tumor metastasis. Conclusion. VFI is usually caused by nerve injury, but it is not a malignant sign of tumor recurrence or metastasis. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84902583952	Usefulness of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis and treatment evaluation in patients with SIH	Background: Most diagnostic tools for spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) are either invasive or occasionally inconsistent with the clinical condition. In this study, we examined the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in SIH using phase-contrast magnetic resonance (PC-MR) imaging. Materials and method: Seventeen SIH patients and 32 healthy individuals, matched by sex and age, were recruited. Each person underwent brain and PC-MR imaging using 3-Tesla MRI.We evaluated the differences in image parameters among patients during the initial and recovery stages against the status of the control group. Results: SIH patients had lower CSF flow-volume, flux, peak velocity, and higher systolic-to-diastolic time ratio, as well as systolic-to-diastolic volume ratio compared to the control group and the conditions when they recovered. The flow time and volume of the diastolic phase markedly increased after treatment. The discriminating power of PC-MR for SIH was good. Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and venous engorgement were present when their PC-MR values were lower than the cut-off values for SIH diagnosis. The headache scores correlated with the peak velocity and pituitary volume. Conclusion: Noninvasive PC-MR could provide valid parameters for diagnosis and treatment follow-up in SIH patients. It may be more sensitive than conventional brain MRI. © International Headache Society 2014.

84905393826	Comparison of activities of daily living impairments in Parkinson's disease patients as defined by the Pill Questionnaire and assessments by neurologists	Objectives: To compare the clinical judgment of experienced neurologists after interviewing Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and their caregivers with the use of the Pill Questionnaire to determine the presence of impairments on activities of daily living (ADL). Background: ADL impairment is a criterion for the diagnosis of dementia associated with PD. The Pill Questionnaire has been recommended as a screening tool to assess ADL impairment in PD patients, but its usefulness and validity have not been fully investigated. Methods: We recruited idiopathic PD patients from 12 hospitals in Taiwan, and the patients underwent clinical assessments, a neuropsychological test battery and the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale evaluation. The Pill Questionnaire was administered by study assistants. Patient and caregiver interviews were performed by experienced neurologists who were blinded to the Pill Questionnaire results. Results: In total, 284 PD patients (mean age 71.8±9 years, mean education 8.7±5.3 years, mean disease duration 5.4±5.3 years) were recruited. 63 patients showed ADL impairment by the Pill Questionnaire, and 108 patients showed ADL impairment by neurologists' clinical interviews. κ Statistics showed moderate agreement between the two methods (κ=0.521, p<0.001). Of the 108 patients who were diagnosed with ADL impairment by neurologists, only 56 patients (51.9%) showed impairment according to the Pill Questionnaire. Most of the missed patients had milder cognitive impairment and lower motor disability. Conclusions: A comprehensive interview is essential to determine the presence of ADL impairment in PD patients, especially in patients with early PD.

84907168789	Initial medication in patients of newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease in Taiwan	Introduction: Several treatment guidelines for Parkinson's disease (PD) had been proposed in recent decades. The aim of current study was to investigate the initial medication utilized in newly diagnosed PD subjects in Taiwan during an eleven-year period. Methods: A total of 7,550 patients with newly diagnosed Parkinsonism were retrospectively enrolled from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan from 2000 to 2010. After excluding patients at risk of secondary or atypical Parkinsonism, those never receiving medication or having incomplete data, 1,645 subjects were included. The participants were then divided into four treating regimen groups, namely levodopa (LD) only group, dopamine agonist (DA) only group, LD+DA group, and No-LD, No-DA group. The demographic data and medication retention rate were compared across the four treatment groups. Results: LD only and No-LD, No-DA regimens were the main initial choice of PD treatment in Taiwan. LD containing drugs were more often prescribed to the elderly population than the other two treatment regimens, while No-LD, No-DA medication was the major initial choice for younger patients. DA only regimen occupied only 3-4% of the initial PD prescriptions and was given predominantly by neurologists. Over the eleven-year period, there is a trend for the middle-aged population to receive medication containing LD as initial treatment. The one year retention rate of anti-Parkinsonism medication was around 30-50% in our population. Age, polypharmacy, change of one-year daily levodopa equivalent dosage and newly onset of dementia, stroke and psychiatric diseases all affect drug compliance in PD patients. Conclusions: This is the first long-term study to explore initial pharmacotherapies in an Asian PD population. We hope to provide evidence for adjusting government policies and public education of physicians and PD patients in the future.
