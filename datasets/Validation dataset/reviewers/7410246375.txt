0030341401	Effects of tetramethylpyrazine phosphate and sodium ferulate alone or in combination on hemodynamics in anesthetized dog	Hemodynamic actions of intravenous (iv) administration of tetramethylpyrazine phosphate (TMPP) and sodium ferulate (SF) alone or in combination were studied in anesthetized dogs. When given alone, TMPP increased left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), peak positive first derivative of left ventricular pressure (+LVdp/dt), coronary blood flow (CBF) and heart rate (HR) while decreasing mean aortic pressure (mAoP). SF alone did not produce any significant hemodynamic changes. When the two were administered in combination, SF antagonized dose-dependently the hemodynamic actions of TMPP. Results of this study did not support the efficacy of combined treatment of Ligusticum wallichi and Angelica root, which contain TMPP and SF respectively. © 1996 Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

2442606810	Changes of somatostatin, motilin and cholecystokinin in gastric antrum tissue and plasma in patients with spleenasthenia	AIM: To explore the objective quantitative index of spleen-asthenia by investigating the effects of Sijunzhi decoction on the somatostatin, motilin and cholecystokinin in gastric antrum tissues and plasma in patients with spleen-asthenia. METHODS: The levels of somatostatin (SS), motilin (Mot) and cholecystokinin (CCK) in gastric antrum tissues and plasma in patients with spleen-asthenia and stomach-heat were observed before and after treatment by RIA, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the stomach-heat and the spleen-asthenia treated by Sijunzhi decoction, patients with spleen-asthenia before the treatment had significantly higher level of motilin both in the tissues and plasma (109.4±18.9 ng/g vs 219.8±25.3 ng/g, and 183.0+23.9 ng/g; plasma: 61.7±10.6 ng/L vs 171.4±30.8 ng/L, and 126.3± 24.6 ng/L) (P <0.01); The SS contents in the tissues and plasma were increased "antrum" (224.3±67.9 ng/g vs 80.2±25.6 ng/g, and 114.3± 34.5 ng/g; plasma: 74.5± 17.2 ng/L vs 30.3±11.8 ng/L, and 38.1±12.7 ng/L) (P <0.01): The CCK levels in gastric antrum and plasma were also arisen (tissues: 34.1±5.2 ng/g vs 21.6±4.7 ng/g, and 29.8±6.8 ng/g; plasma: 5.8±0.4 ng/L vs 3.7±0.6 ng/L, and 2.9±0.8 ng/L)(P <0.01). The contents of Mot, SS and CCK in patients with stomach-heat were not significantly changed (P >0.05). CONCLUSION: The contents of Mot, SS and CCK may have important values in the clinical diagnosis and treament for patients with spleen-asthenia.

31544449701	Anorectal manometry and efficiency of functional incontinence treated by biofeedback	Objective: To investigate the significance of anorectal manometry in evaluating functional incontinence and the efficiency of biofeedback. Data sources: A computer-based search of http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed was undertaken to identify the articles about about anorectum manometry and functional incontinence or biofeedback published in English from January 1999 to February 2005 by using the keywords of "anorectum manometry, functional incontinence, biofeedback". Study se lection: Inclusive criteria: (1) randomized controlled clinical trial; (2) retrospective study; (3) evidence-based medicine. Exclusive criteria: non-randomized controlled clinical trial. Data extraction: To tally 10 randomized controlled clinical trials about the anorectal manometry of functional incontinence and 46 about functional incontinence treated by biofeedback were collected, and the duplicate trials and reviews were excluded. Data synthesis: (1) Anorectal manometry: It was summarized that the methods of anorectal manometry and physiological significance of the indexes (anal canal resting pressure and anal canal squeeze pressure or rectal compliance) and the clinical significance in patients with functional incontinence. (2) Biofeedback treatment in functional incontinence: It was proved by evidence-based medicine that biofeedback is an effective method as an additional treatment combined with drugs used in functional incontinence. Some authors critically analyzed that most of the randomized clinical trials were short of physiological data and uniform index to assess effect. Conclusion: Anorectal manometry used in functional incontinence is controversial, still needs further research, biofeedback is an effective method as an additional methods combined with drugs used in functional incontinence.

33751078340	Danggui-Buxue-Tang decoction has an anti-inflammatory effect in diabetic atherosclerosis rat model	Danggui-Buxue-Tang (DBT) is a famous traditional Chinese formula. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of it in diabetic atherosclerosis rats. DBT (3 or 6 g/kg/day for 4 weeks) was orally administrated to the diabetic atherosclerosis rats, which were induced by nitric oxide inhibition (l-NAME in drinking water, 1 mg/ml) plus high-fat diet. The concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and serum fructosamine were determined. The results showed that DBT had no direct effect in lowering serum fructosamine level, but can decrease the concentrations of CRP and TNF-α, produce a higher survival rate and less body weight loss, and decrease water intake in diabetic atherosclerosis in GK rats. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

35348869154	Effect of oriental herbal prescription Guan-Xin-Er-Hao on coronary flow in healthy volunteers and antiapoptosis on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in rat models	Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the main cause of death and a major public health problem in the world. The traditional herbal medicinal formula Guan-Xin-Er-Hao (GXEH) has been used in China and East Asia for the treatment of coronary heart disease, however, the underlying cardioprotection mechanisms remain unclear. To make clear the antiischemic mechanism involved, GXEH was orally administered to 15 healthy volunteers. Heart rates (HR), blood pressure and coronary flow (CF) velocity before and 1 h after a single oral dose of GXEH were observed and compared. It was demonstrated that the oral administration of GXEH increased CF acutely in a dose-dependent manner without modification of systemic hemodynamic parameters. Moreover, the myocardial protection function of GXEH was also experimentally examined in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) rat models. Apoptosis was measured quantitatively by the terminal transferase UTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method and confirmed by caspase-3 activity. The infarct size and TUNEL-positive cells of GXEH-treated group (20 g/kg) were reduced significantly, which was consistent with the decreased caspase-3 activity. These suggest that GXEH protects hearts from ischemia injury by increasing CF and reduces infarct size by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0034046313	Relationship between IMC, gut motility and motilin level in Pixu rats	AIM: To explore the mechanism of Pixu by studying the relationship between interdigestive myoelectric complex (IMC), gut motility and motilin (Mot) level in Pixu rats. METHODS: Pixu rat model was established by intramuscular injection of reserpine 0.3 mg/(kg · d) for seven days or fourteen days respectively and treated by Chinese classical prescription Sijunzi or Liuweidihuang decoction (6 g/d, ig, x 14). Mot levels in plasma and tissues of stomach, duodenum and hypothalamus of rats were determined by RIA, IMC and gastrointestinal motility were recorded synchronously and dynamically by chronically implanted electrodes and sensing element at different gastrointestinal parts to analyze the duration of IMC and the count and amplitude of movement waves. RESULTS: Compared with the control, the electric and mechanical movement of duodenum were stronger in early phase (6.5 ± 0.4 vs 4.2 ± 0.3 min, 103.5 ± 9.7 vs 78.9 ± 6.3 mV/min and 21.4 ± 1.9 vs 17.3 ± 0.9 times/min) and were weaker in late phase (1.1 ± 0.3 vs 4.2 ± 0.3 min and 11.7 ± 1.2 vs 17.3 ± 0.9 times/min) of Pixu rats than those of normal rats (P < 0.05-0.01). In Pixu rats the Mot levels in early phase were increased (76.4 ± 8.0, 37.2 ± 7.3, 51.2 ± 1.9, 63.2 ± 2.2 and 99.8 ± 6.5 vs 53.2 ± 9.3, 29.5 ± 7.6, 35.6 ± 3.0, 46.6 ± 7.0 and 82.7 ± 9.3 ng/L) and in late phase were decreased (32.5 ± 5.5, 21.6 ± 6.2, 27.9 ± 1.7, 32.3 ± 5.1 and 64.5 ± 5.4 ng/L, P<0.01). Both in early and late phase of Pixu, the electricity (8.2 ± 0.9, 6.2 ± 1.1 vs 3.5 ± 0.8 min) and movement (9.2 ± 1.8, 5.2 ± 0.2 vs 13.4 ± 1.3 times/min; 75.2 ± 10.1, 42.4 ± 9.1 vs 110.2 ± 9.8 mV/min) of stomach were weaken (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: With different deficient degree of Pixu, Mot levels, IMC durations of four phases and the movement wave of duodenum are different. The coefficient of correlation of IMC-movement-Mot level in stomach is -0.9986 and in duodenum +0.9937, which may reflect the different pathological phase of Pixu.

0034048098	Pharmacokinetics of traditional Chinese syndrome and recipe: A hypothesis and its verification (I)	Aim: To propose a hypothesis defining the absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of traditional Chinese recipe (TCR)-component in blood of healthy subjects and patients, and estimate its correctness. Methods: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of same dose of drug was studied in the animal model of traditional Chinese syndrome (S) and healthy animals. The classification, terminology, concept and significance of the hypothesis were set forth with evidence provided in the present study. The hypotheses consisted of traditional Chinese syndrome PK (S-PK) and traditional Chinese recipe PK (R-PK). Firstly, the observed tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) PK in healthy, chronically reserpinized rats (rat model of spleen deficiency syndrome, RMSDS) and RMSDS treated with Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) for confirmation were used to verify S-PK; secondly, the ferulic acid (FA) PK in healthy and high molecular weight dextran (HMWD)-induced rabbit model with blood stasis syndrome (RDBSS) was also used to verify S-PK; and lastly, TMP PK parameters in serum of healthy rats after orally taken Ligusticum wallichii (LW), LW and Salvia miltiorrhiza (LW and SM) decoctions were compared to verify R-PK.

0033999006	Somatostatin, cholecystokinin and motilin levels in plasma and tissues in experimental Pixu rats	AIM: To explore the relationship between gastrointestinal hormones and pathogenesis of Pixu Spleen asthenia syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). METHODS: The rat Pixu models (n = 70) were treated by reserpine 0.3 mg/(kg·d) for seven days or fourteen days respectively. The SS, CCK and Mot levels in tissues and plasma of rat models were measured by RIA, compared with the normal group and the group prevented and treated by Sijunzi decoction (SIJD). RESULTS: In Pixu rat models of seven days, as compared with controls, the plasma and hypothalamus levels of SS increased (106.5 ± 13.9 and 143.1 ± 8.5 vs 85.2 ± 4.3 and 136.9 ± 40.9) and the peripheral levels decreased (27.5 ± 1.6, 22.7 ± 1.2 and 19.5 ± 2.4 vs 91.4 ± 9.6, 50.7 ± 5.6 and 55.5 ± 6.8, P < 0.01); both tissues and plasma had higher levels of CCK (88.1 ± 5.2, 59.2 ± 3.5, 79.1 ± 8.7, 68.5 ± 4.7 and 6.9 ± 0.2) and Mot (76.4 ± 8.0, 51.2 ± 1.9, 37.2 ± 7.3, 63.2 ± 2.2 and 99.8 ± 6.5) than those of controls (73.0 ± 2.4, 43.1 ± 2.3, 63.1 ± 7.1, 59.2 ± 6.7, 3.8 ± 0.1 and 53.2 ± 9.3, 35.6 ± 3.0, 29.5 ± 7.6, 46.6 ± 7.0, 82.7 ± 9.3, P < 0.01, p < 0.05). In Pixu rat models of fourteen days, as compared with controls, the SS levels was lowered in hypothalamus (98.3 ± 28.7) and plasma (68.2 ± 2.6), and in tissues (119.3 ± 5.2, 98.4 ± 9.2 and 88.2 ± 2.8) was increased, the levels of Mot decreased in plasma (64.5 ± 5.4, P < 0.05) and tissues (27.9 ± 1.8, 21.62 ± 6.2 and 32.3 ± 5.1, P < 0.01); CCK levels were higher in stomach (54.2 ± 6.4) and hypothalamus (84.1 ± 1.5, P < 0.01) and lower in plasma (2.8 ± 0.4) and gut (43.2 ± 2.3, 36.5 ± 3.3, P < 0.01) than those of controls. There was no significant disorder of SS, CCK and Mot in the group prevented and treated with SJZD. CONCLUSION: The levels of SS, CCK and Mot varied with the development of TCM Spleen asthenia syndrome and could be modulated by SJZD.

57949115864	Cardioprotection by Guanxin II in rats with acute myocardial infarction is related to its three compounds	Aim: We tested the hypothesis that cardioprotection afforded by traditional Chinese Guanxin II (GXII) formula is related to absorbed bioactive compounds (ABCs). Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were induced by coronary occlusion. ABCs including ferulic acid (F), hydroxyl safflor yellow A (A), tanshinol (T), protocatechualdehyde (P) and paeoniflorin (E) were measured in blood after oral GXII. The effects of GXII and FATPE, alone and in combination, and of some components of FATPE on infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3 activity were determined. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) in AMI rat was detected 2 h after oral GXII and FAT. Results: FATPE was found in rat blood. FAT was similar to FATPE and GXII in decreasing infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3 activity of AMI. Both FAT and GXII were similar in increasing of MBF. Conclusion: GXII and FAT protect the heart from ischemic injury by increasing MBF, and decrease infarct size by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. These findings provide a potential cardioprotective cocktail. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

59149099916	Antiapoptotic mechanisms of Chinese medicine formula, Guan-Xin-Er-Hao, in the rat ischemic heart	Considerable evidence indicates that apoptosis plays a critical role in acute myocardial infarction. We have previously shown that Guan-Xin-Er-Hao (GXEH), a Chinese medicine formula, attenuates postischemia myocardial apoptosis. The present study was designed to determine the mechanisms by which GXEH exerts its antiapoptotic effect. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive vehicle or GXEH (5 or 15 g/kg) orally 30 min before ischemia and subjected to myocardial ischemia of 3 h (apoptosis peak) or 24 h (necrosis peak) for determination of infarct size. Compared with rats receiving vehicle, those rats treated with GXEH (15 g/kg) showed significantly reduced infarct size, the reduced myocardial apoptosis, as judged by the decreases in TUNEL-positive staining (22.40 ± 5.68% vs. 40.31 ± 10.58%, p < 0.01), and the decrease in the degree of caspase-3 activation (82.97 ± 10.54 vs. 159.95 ± 9.16 μmol cleaved acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide/mg protein, p < 0.01). Treatment with GXEH (15 g/kg) significantly reduced. the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, a primary mediator of apoptosis, the degree of caspase-9 activation, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Caspase-9 cleaves and activates caspase-3. Bax promotes apoptosis, while Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis. Thus, the antiapoptotic mechanisms of GXEH may involve the mitochondrial cytochrome c-mediated caspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes after acute myocardial infarction. Taken together, GXEH tilted the balance between Bax and Bcl-2 toward an antiapoptotic state, decreased mitochondrial cytochrome c release, reduced caspase-9 activation, and attenuated subsequent caspase-3 activation and postischemic myocardial apoptosis in rats. GXEH may be used as a promising agent for future treatment of cardiovascular diseases. © 2008 Tohoku University Medical Press.

77954617997	Anti-inflammatory effect of Guan-Xin-Er-Hao via the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway in rats with acute myocardial infarction	A traditional Chinese medicine, Guan-Xin-Er-Hao (GXEH), is a famous multiple target therapeutic polypharmaceutical. Our aim was to evaluate whether or not oral administration of GXEH has an anti-inflammatory effect associated with blockade of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB), and to investigate the NF-icB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression pathway during acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: oral GXEH administered at 15 or 5 g/kg, the vehicle control and sham-operated groups. Thirty minutes after giving GXEH or 0.9% NaCI (p.o.) once, coronary arteries were occluded except for the sham-operated rats. We measured 24-h infarct size, 3-h expression of NF-kB protein in the myocardial left ventricular tissues and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Compared with rats receiving vehicle, rats administered 15 g/kg GXEH had significantly reduced 24-h infarct size, expression of NF-kB protein and serum concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP. GXEH at 5 g/kg did not have a significant effect on these parameters. In conclusion, GXEH exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of the NF-kB-mediated signaling pathway leading to downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. These findings provide new evidence of the cardioprotective effect of GXEH through reduction of infarct size by mediating lots of endogenous materials via multiple pathways to act on myocardial cells in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Separation of the monomers in rat plasma was accomplished on a YMC C18 stationary phase (4.6×150mm, 5m) and a mobile phase of methanol-water containing 0.2% acetic acid (70:30, v/v), with a UV detector setting at 254nm. The calibration curves for the four compounds were linear in an appropriate concentration ranges. The intra- and inter-day assay coefficients in plasma were less than 10.96% and the recoveries of the method were higher than 90.0%. The validated method was successfully applied in the aforementioned pharmacokinetic study. The results show that the pharmacokinetics of aloe-emodin, rhein, emodin, and chrysophanol in the rat is different when given orally alone, as a Rhei Rhizoma mixture, or in a Chaiqin-Chengqi-Tang prescription. This may be due to unidentified herb-herb or herbal constituent interaction mechanisms. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

84887966108	UPLC-PDA determination of paeoniflorin in rat plasma following the oral administration of Radix Paeoniae Alba and its effects on rats with collagen-induced arthritis	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disabling autoimmune disease with characteristics of chronic, progressive inflammatory joint synovial damage, which mainly encroaches upon the synovium of the joint. The use of traditional medicine to treat RA slows the development of RA to a certain extent; however, it often has numerous side-effects. Therefore, the focus of RA research is the identification of a new, safe and effective medicine. The aim of the present study was to use an ultra performance liquid chromatography and photo diode array (UPLC-PDA) method to detect the paeoniflorin component in a Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction and in rat plasma following the oral administration of Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction. In addition, the effects of paeoniflorin on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in rats were investigated. The results indicate that a UPLC-PDA method for determining the presence of paeoniflorin in the Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction was successfully established. The method was fast, simple, sensitive, precise and valid. Paeoniflorin was shown to be a bioactive component of the Radix Paeoniae Alba decoction that was absorbed into rat plasma. Paeoniflorin significantly improved the disease resistant ability of RA rats and reduced the levels of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, thereby inhibiting inflammation and bone erosion in the rats with CIA. The observations are likely to lay the foundation for further study of the mechanism of paeoniflorin in the treatment of RA.

There was no reliable analytical method available for the quality control of DT. Methods: A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with a reverse phase C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm) was developed. The mobile phase was methanol with 0.2% acetic acid. Eight markers including naringin, hesperidin, aloe emodin, rhein, honokiol, magnolol, emodin and chrysophanol were determined. Results: Regression analysis revealed a linear relationship between the concentrations of the markers and the peak area ratio of the standards and internal standard. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) and the limit of qualification (RSD < 20%) ranged from 0.21 to 0.43 ng/μl and 0.76 to 1.74 ng/μl respectively. The recovery was between 95.6% and 103.4%. The tests on the samples from three batches of DT showed that the profiles of the markers did not vary significantly among batches. Conclusion: A reliable HPLC method for simultaneous determination of the eight markers in DT was developed. © 2008 Tang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

50049114460	Effect of Da-Cheng-Qi decoction on the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in rats	Da Cheng Qi decoction (DCQD) is composed of Dahuang, Houpu, Zhishi and Mangxiao. It is a formula created under the theory of Chinese medicine to purge the 'evil heat' in the gastrointestitinal tract, which arises from the ileus and acute pancreatitis. The present study was conducted to evaluate the herb-drug interaction between DCOD and ranitidine, which are often co-administered in clinical practice. Ranitidine was administered orally alone or together with DCQD to rats, and plasma ranitidine concentrations were measured by HPLC. Following oral administration, ranitidine plasma levels revealed curves characterized by peaks at 1.8 and 4.2 h corresponding to ranitidine alone and ranitidine with DCOD at mean concentrations of 16.315 and 1.455 μg/mL, respectively. After ranitidine was orally dosed alone or with DCQD, the half-lives were 1.787 and 3.758 h, while the area under the concentration-time curve (0-12 h) was 28.083 and 9.826 μg/L h, respectively, suggesting that DCQD might significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of ranitidine in rats. When physicians or pharmacists administer DCQD and ranitidine, they must make a careful effort to adjust the dosage of the drug and Chinese decoction, or avoid the herb-drug co-administration.

Methods: A total of 8 healthy men were enlisted in this study. The serum samples were preprocessed by immersion method. The HPLC system was used to determine the contents of ferulic acid and paeoniflorin in the blood samples of the 8 healthy volunteers, and the blood was collected through the ulnar vein at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h after MXYD administration. The dates of serum concentration-time were fitted by using the 3P97 analytical program of pharmacokinetics. The internal standard (IS) was coumarin. The detection wavelengths of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid were 230 nm from 0 min to 10 min and 320 nm from 10 min to 25 min respectively. Results: After MXYD administration, paeoniflorin and ferulic acid were separated completely in the serum and no other interfering peaks were found in the spectrum of the chromatograms. The retention times of the paeoniflorin and ferulic acid were 8.02 min and 13.32 min respectively, and that of the coumarin was 19.14 min. The mean recovery rates of paeoniflorin and ferulic acid were 100.9% and 95.3% with relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3.2% and 3.4%, respectively. The calibration curve for paeoniflorin was linear over the concentration range 40-1 280 ng/ml. Its low-detection limit based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was 5 ng/ml and low-concentration limit was 15 ng/ml with an RSD of 12.5%. Ferulic acid was in the range 10-320 ng/ml; its low-detection limit was 0.65 ng/ml and low-concentration limit was 5 ng/ml with an RSD of 9.7%. The method was found to be highly precise, with an RSD < 5% and interday and intraday variability in the range of 92.1%-109.9% for each of the concentrations tested. Conclusion: This is a study on simultaneously determining paeoniflorin and ferulic acid in serum of healthy volunteers after oral administration of MXYD. The assay is suitable for identifying the serum levels of ferulic acid and paeoniflorin in clinical investigations.

59649105210	Chinese medicinal formula Guan-Xin-Er-Hao protects the heart against oxidative stress induced by acute ischemic myocardial injury in rats	Guan-Xin-Er-Hao (GXEH) is a Chinese medicine formula for treating ischemic heart diseases (IHD) and has a favorable effect. Our aim was to examine whether or not acute oral GXEH could protect the heart against myocardial infarction and apoptosis in acute myocardial ischemic rats. If so, we would explain the antioxidative mechanism involved. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded to induce myocardial ischemia in hearts of Sprague-Dawley rats. At the end of the 3 h ischemic period (or 24 h for infarct size), we measured the myocardial infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and the activities of antioxidative enzymes. GXEH reduced infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and the serum level of malondialdehyde (MDA), increased the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GSH-peroxidase (GPX) activities and the serum level of glutathione (GSH). GXEH exerts significant cardioprotective effects against acute ischemic myocardial injury in rats, likely through its antioxidation and antilipid peroxidative properties, and thus may be used as a promising agent for both prophylaxis and treatment of IHD.

69049097154	Chinese herbal medicine modified xiaoyao san for functional dyspepsia: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials	Background: To critically assess the evidence of modified xiaoyao san (MXS) for treating functional dyspepsia (FD). Methods: Systematic literature searches were carried out on the Medline database, CNKI database, Wanfang Data, VIP Information and the Cochrane Library. Reference lists located were checked for further relevant publications. Experts in the field and manufacturers of identified products were contacted for unpublished material. Studies were selected according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All randomized clinical trials of MXS for treating FD were included. Study selection, data extraction and validation were carried out by at least two reviewers with disagreements being settled by discussion. Weighted means and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and sensitivity analyses were carried out. Results: Thirty-three potentially relevant articles were retrieved for further evaluation. Fourteen were suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. There was evidence that MXS compared with prokinetic drugs reduced symptoms (odds ratio 3.26, 95% CI 2.24 to 4. 47). There was evidence that MXS + prokinetic drugs compared with prokinetic drugs reduced symptoms (odds ratio 4.32, 95% CI 2.64 to 7.08). Conclusion: MXS appears to be more effective compared to prokinetic drugs in the treatment of FD and no serious side-effects were identified. However, the evidence remains weak due to publication bias and methodological flaws, which may amplify the therapeutic benefit of MXS.

73849129537	Dachengqi Decoction induces pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis in experimental acute pancreatitis in rats	Objective: To explore the effects of Dachengqi Decoction (DCQD), e compound traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis in a rat model of experimental acute pancreatitis. Methods: A total of 36 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group and DCQD-treated group (12 rats in each group). Acute pancreatitis was induced in 24 rats by retrograde injection of 3.5% sodium taurocholate into pancreatic bile duct. The other 12 rats were allocated as sham-operated group. After the operation, the spray-dried DCQD (2 g/mL of crude drugs) or normal saline at 10 mL/kg body weight of rets were orally administered. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation 12 h and 24 h after the administration, and samples were collected. Amylase activity in serum, nitric oxide (NO) content and inducible NO synthetase (iNOS) activity in pancreatic tissue were measured respectively. Pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis was identified by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labeling, and pathological scores of pancreatic tissues were determined under a light microscope. Results: At the two time points after treatment, the activities of serum amylase in the treated group were significantly lower than those in the untreated group (P<0.05), while the contents of pancreatic NO and activities of iNOS were higher than those in the untreated group (P<0.05), respectively. The pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis rates in the treatment group at 12 h and 24 h were higher than those in the untreated group, and the mean pancreatic pathomorphologic scores decreased correspondingly (P<0.05). Conclusion: DCQD can induce pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis by increasing NO content and iNOS activity in the pancreas of experimental acute pancreatitis, which helps attenuate the pancreatic pathomorphology.

73849148814	Guanxin II for the management of coronary heart disease	This article presents an integrated overview of Guanxin II regarding its quality control, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, clinical studies, adverse events, dosage and administration, and its pharmacoeconomic assessment. It has been demonstrated that Guanxin II has beneficial effects on coronary heart disease (CHD). The underlying mechanism was proved to be its anti-ischemic, anti-apoptotic, antioxidative, antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects, and so on. Tanshinol, hydroxysafflor yellow A and ferulic acid might be responsible for the cardioprotective effect of Guanxin II. In terms of acquisition cost, Guanxin II is cheaper than other drugs currently available for CHD. Guanxin II is safe, cheap, and effective in the management of CHD. However, the mechanism of its cardioprotective effects has not been completely understood because of limitations in the research methodologies of Chinese medicine. Further work should be carried out with single components such as tanshinol, hydroxysafflor yellow A and ferulic acid, using modern biochemical and molecular methods.

77949426581	Pretreatment with a traditional Chinese formula, Guanxin II, reduces cardiac apoptosis via the akt survival pathway in rats with myocardial ischemia	Guanxin II (GXII) is a traditional Chinese formula to treat coronary heart disease in China. Previous studies indicate cardioprotection of GXII are related to cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Akt is necessary and sufficient for inhibition of apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Our aim was to examine whether or not the antiapoptotic mechanisms of GXII are related to the Akt pathway. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: GXII administered at 2.5 or 0.5 g raw materials/kg, the vehicle control and sham-operated oral 0.9% NaCI. They were pretreated once a day for 15 consecutive days by gavage. Thirty min after the last administration, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded to induce myocardial ischemia except for the sham-operated rats. Compared with rats receiving vehicle, those rats pretreated with GXII at 2.5 g/kg significantly reduced infarct size and decrease apoptosis. Furthermore, GXII (2.5 g/kg) significantly activated Akt kinase, increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, inhibited cytochrome c release, reduced caspase-9 activation, and attenuated subsequent caspase-3 activation. GXII at 0.5 g/kg have no noticeable effect on these parameters. Meanwhile, GXII at 2.5 g/kg did not change myocardial blood flow of ischemic zone, indicating a direct action on cardiomyocytes. These results suggest GXII at 2.5 g/kg ensures the survival of myocardium by enhancing the Akt-mediated antiapoptosis pathway. The findings provide new evidence of the effective and safe therapy with GXII for patients with chronic coronary heart disease. © 2010 Tohoku University Medical Press.

77953258349	IGF2BP2 variations influence repaglinide response and risk of type 2 diabetes in Chinese population	Aim: To investigate whether the insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) rs1470579 and rs4402960 polymorphisms are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and the repaglinide therapeutic efficacy in Chinese T2DM patients. Methods: A case-control study of a total of 350 patients with T2DM and 207 healthy volunteers was conducted to identify their genotypes for the IGF2BP2 rs1470579 and rs4402960 polymorphisms using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Forty-two patients were randomly selected to undergo an 8-week repaglinide treatment (3 mg/d). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbAlc), fasting serum insulin (FINS), postprandial serum insulin (PINS), homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) were determined before and after repaglinide treatment. Results: The frequencies of the IGF2BP2 rs1470579 C allele and the rs4402960 T allele were higher in T2DM patients than in healthy controls (P<0.05 and P<0.001, respectively). The effects of the repaglinide treatment on FPG (P<0.05) and PPG (P<0.05) were reduced in patients with the rs1470579 AC+CC genotypes compared with AA genotype carriers. Patients with the rs4402960 GT+TT genotypes exhibited an enhanced effect of repaglinide treatment on PINS (P<0.01) compared with GG genotype subjects. Conclusion: The IGF2BP2 rs1470579 and rs4402960 polymorphisms may be associated with the development of T2DM, and these polymorphisms may affect the therapeutic efficacy of repaglinide in Chinese T2DM patients. © 2010 CPS and SIMM.

Methods: Ferulic acid (F), tanshinol (T), hydroxysafflor yellow A (A), protocatechualdehyde (P) and paeoniflorin (E) in GXEH formula and FTA in blood from rat with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were first identified by HPLC-MS/MS, and FTAPE in GXEH formulae with various herbs, extraction times and extraction water volumes were then quantitated only by HPLC. Results: FTAPE in various GXEH were determined. FTA were selected as GXEH's ABCs. Ratios of FTA were determined, suggesting the high (1:6.1:15.6), medium (1:1.7:15.2) and low (1:0.2:15.3) ratios. Three FTA ratios and their parent formulae ratio-dependently reduced infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3 activity. Conclusion: There is the optimal ratio of F:T:A among various formulae, contributing to the best cardioprotection. This FTA ratio was developed as quality control of GXEH formula.

78751578824	Meranzin Hydrate Induces Similar Effect to Fructus Aurantii on Intestinal Motility through Activation of H	This experiment studied the potential effect of meranzin hydrate (MH) and decoction of herb Fructus Aurantii (FA) on rat gut motility. It also investigated the prokinetic mechanism of MH. Experiments were performed on male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-220 g). The study included: (1) qualitation of MH and four other known compounds in FA and jejunum after oral administration of FA decoction to rats; (2) in vitro experiment of MH on rat jejunum contractions; (3) in vivo experiment of FA and MH in rats. Dose-dependently, MH (1-100 μM) increased amplitude in longitudinal and circular jejunum muscles. Pretreatment of jejunum longitudinal strips with benzhydramine (1 μM) remarkably inhibited the contractions induced by histamine (1 μM) and MH (10 or 30 μM). Pretreatment of jejunum longitudinal strips with atropine (1 μM) reduced the contractions induced by acetylcholine (1 μM) but did not influence the contractions induced by MH (10 or 30 μM). Interestingly, the antagonism of benzhydramine to MH was also verified in vivo. MH can be absorbed into the jejunum following oral administration of FA decoction. In healthy rats, MH (7, 14, and 28 mg/kg) and FA (3. 3, 10, and 20 g/kg) both promoted intestinal transit and gastric emptying in a dose-dependent manner when gavaged acutely. In cisplatin model rats, MH (14 and 28 mg/kg) significantly reversed cisplatin-induced delay in gastric emptying. Meranzin hydrate can induce similar effect to Fructus Aurantii on intestinal motility and it was, at least in part, mediated by stimulation of H1 histamine receptors. © 2010 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.

79956369492	Inhibition of hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization in mice with short hairpin RNA targeting Rac1, possibly via blockading redox signaling	NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species are involved in angiogenesis in vitro and regulated by ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). This study has employed vector-based short hairpin RNA targeting Rac1 (Rac1-shRNA) to investigate the inhibitory effect on hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization (RN) in vivo and the underlying mechanism. pSUPER-Rac1-shRNA was intravitreally injected into the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. RN was evaluated by FITC-dextran angiography and quantitated histologically. Expressions of Rac1, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit p65, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. After intravitreal administration of pSUPER-Rac1-shRNA, retinal Rac1 gene expression was reduced by 72% at postnatal day 17 (P17). Retinal flat mount and quantification of the neovascular nuclei demonstrated that RN was significantly inhibited. Meanwhile, the expression levels of NF-κB and HIF-1α, the redox-dependent transcription factors, were significantly downregulated. HIF-1α and its downstream gene VEGF were found to be significantly decreased at both transcriptional and translational levels. Our findings not only suggest that Rac1 may be involved in the process of RN in mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy via regulating the redox signaling, but may also provide a novel therapeutic target for hypoxia-induced retinal neovascular diseases. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79960110638	Summary of integrative medicine for severe acute pancreatitis: 26-year clinical experiences and a report of 1 561 cases	Objective: To investigate the changing trends of clinical management for severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) with integrative medicine. Methods: Clinical data of 1 561 patients with SAP from 1980 to 2005 was retrospectively analyzed. The mortality and morbidity of complications were compared. Results: Of the 1 561 patients, 400 patients accepted surgical operation, while the rest were treated conservatively with integrative medicine. There was a change toward conservative management together with Chinese purgative herbal medication use after 1990 (22.4% from 1980-1990 compared with 45.5% from 1991-1993) because of high postoperative mortality. From 1994-2005, the treatment integrating Western medicine with Chinese herbal medications came to be preferred over the classic Western operation-based method. This change was associated with decreased morbidity (35.4% in 1980-1990 compared with 24.7% in 1991-1993 and 11.0% in 1994-2005, P<0.05) and lower mortality (40.52% of 1980-1990 compared with 17.17% of 1991-1993 and <10.25% of 1994-2005, P<0.05). Conclusion: The combination of conservative management with Chinese herbal medicines is preferable to classic Western medicine treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality of SAP, while surgery becomes a supplemental option. © 2011 Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80053290306	Ferulic acid-induced anti-depression and prokinetics similar to Chaihu-Shugan-San via polypharmacology	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), one of popular antidepressants as " one-compound-one-target" paradigm, cannot but discontinue because of inhibiting gut movement. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) Chaihu-Sugan-San (CSS) can simultaneously exert anti-depression and prokinetics. From this thread, we aimed to find a new antidepressant with polypharmacological mechanisms. In vivo antidepressive and prokinetic comparisons between CSS and its absorbed compound ferulic acid (FA) were made. And FA's action mechanisms involved in monoaminergic systems, HPA axis and gastrointestinal peptide ghrelin was then studied in forced swimming test (FST) of rat. Lastly, the jejunal contraction activity evoked by FA was measured in vitro. Compared with vehicle, FA reduced immobility time, increased locomotor activity, accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit similar to CSS whose absorbable component FA was identified in hippocampus and jejunum. FA's prokinetics in vivo was further supported by its jejunal contraction in vitro. FA-induced anti-immobility was prevented by pretreated with PCPA, WAY-100635, ketanserin, sulpiride, SCH233390, haloperidol and yohimbine, respectively. CRH, ACTH and 5-HT were significantly decreased, but ghrelin was apparently increased compared with vehicle. In summary, FA induced anti-depression and prokinetics similar to CSS via inhibiting serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine reuptakes, regulating HPA axis, increasing ghrelin and stimulating jejunal contraction simultaneously. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80955178296	Pharmacokinetic study of the prokinetic compounds meranzin hydrate and ferulic acid following oral administration of Chaihu-Shugan-San to patients with functional dyspepsia	Aim of the study: The prokinetic activity of ferulic acid derived from Ligusticum chuanxiong hort in the Chaihu-Shugan-San formula has been shown to be similar to Chaihu-Shugan-San, a popular traditional Chinese medicine for treating functional dyspepsia. The effects of meranzin hydrate, a compound isolated from Fructus aurantii in the Chaihu-Shugan-San formula, are unclear, as the pharmacokinetics have never been studied in patients with functional dyspepsia. This study aimed to describe the pharmacokinetics of ferulic acid and merazin hydrate by evaluating the prokinetics induced by Chaihu-Shugan-San and meranzin hydrate. Materials and methods: Gastric emptying and intestinal transit were measured after oral administration of a single dose of Chaihu-Shugan-San or meranzin hydrate in rats. The tone of rat ileum was selected as direct evidence of the prokinetic activity of meranzin hydrate. Patients with functional dyspepsia were recruited, and meranzin hydrate and ferulic acid were identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry in the plasma of patients following a single oral administration of Chaihu-Shugan-San. The resulting pharmacokinetic properties were determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to photo diode array. Results: In rats, single doses of Chaihu-Shugan-San (20 g/kg) and meranzin hydrate (28 mg/kg) significantly accelerated gastric emptying and intestinal transit (Chaihu-Shugan-San: 68.9 ± 5.6% and 72.3 ± 4.7%, meranzin hydrate: 72.9 ± 3.8% and 75.2 ± 3.1%) compared with the control (55.45 ± 3.7% and 63.51 ± 5.1%, P < 0.05), showing similar results as cisapride (69.6 ± 4.8% and 71.6 ± 6.3%). Meranzin hydrate (30, 100 μmol/L) directly increased the amplitude of rat ileum compared with the control (P < 0.01). The pharmacokinetics profiles of meranzin hydrate and ferulic acid in patient plasma was fitted with a two-compartment model detected by a simple, rapid and accurate UPLC method. Time to reach peak concentration of meranzin hydrate (0.371 mg/L) and ferulic acid (0.199 mg/L) was 23.57 min and 27.50 min, respectively. The elimination half-life and area under the concentration-time curve from t = 0 to the last time of meranzin hydrate and ferulic acid were 139.53 min and 31.445 μg min/mL and 131.27 min and 14.835 μg min/mL, respectively.

84855448423	Dan-Shen-Yin protects the heart against inflammation and oxidative stress induced by acute ischemic myocardial injury in rats	Dan-Shen-Yin (DSY) is a well-known traditional Chinese formula which is widely used in clinical practice for the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD) and has produced a favorable effect in China. The present study was designed to examine whether or not acute oral DSY can protect the heart against myocardial infarction in acute myocardial ischemic rats. If so, we would then investigate the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms involved. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded to induce myocardial ischemia in the hearts of Sprague-Dawley rats. At the end of the 3-h ischemic period (or 24 h for infarction size), we measured the myocardial infarction size, inflammatory factors and the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes. DSY reduced the infarction size and the serum levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-α and malondialdehyde and increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and the serum levels of glutathione. The results show that DSY exerts significant cardioprotective effects against acute ischemic myocardial injury in rats, possibly through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and may thus be used as a potential therapeutic reagent for the treatment of CHD.

Subjects were classified as MHO (n = 25) or at-risk (n = 25) based on the upper and lower quartiles of insulin sensitivity as measured by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. The MHO group presented a significantly higher range of plasma epinephrine levels (73 ± 21. pg/mL) than the at-risk group (39 ± 20. pg/mL) (P<0.05), though both within the normal basal range of plasma epinephrine (56 ± 30. pg/mL). Multivariate regression analysis showed that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, plasma epinephrine, triglycerides and lean body mass index were independent predictors of glucose disposal. The plasma epinephrine level was positively correlated with the glucose disposal rate, insulin sensitivity and the HDL-cholesterol level, and negatively correlated with the triglycerides level (P<0.05). In conclusion, this study for the first time demonstrates a positive association between plasma epinephrine level and insulin sensitivity in MHO individuals. © 2011.

84857239170	Pharmacokinetic comparisons of albiflorin and paeoniflorin after oral administration of Shaoyao-Gancao-Tang and single herb Paeony decoction to rats	Shaoyao-Gancao-Tang (SGT) is a traditional Chinese prescription containing Radix Paeoniae alba and Radix Glycyrrhizae and is commonly used to relieve pains. Albiflorin and paeoniflorin are the main effective compounds of Radix Paeoniae alba, and the pharmacokinetic differences of the two compounds in rats after oral administration of SGT and single herb Paeony decoction were studied. At different time points (5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 540min) after administration, plasma concentrations of albiflorin and paeoniflorin were determined using a simple and reliable UPLC method, and main pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated. It was found that there were significant differences (p<0.05 or p<0.01) between the two groups. The results indicated that some components in the other ingredient herb of SGT (Radix Glycyrrhizae) had a pharmacokinetic interaction with albiflorin and paeoniflorin and hence reduced their systematic exposure level. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

84861188681	Meta-analysis of the clinical effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine formula Chaihu-Shugan-San in depression	Aim of study: Depression is a psychiatric disorder. Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) is a traditional Chinese medicine formula suggested in the treatment of depression, but its effectiveness and safety are not well defined. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of CSS in depression therapy. Materials and methods: The databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CNKI database, Wanfang Data and VIP Information were searched. Papers were reviewed systematically by two researchers and were analyzed using Cochrane software Revman 5.0. Results: Ten randomized controlled trials comparing 835 subjects were included. Of these studies, seven studies used fluoxetine (20 mg, once a day), two used paroxetine (20 mg, once a day) and one used doxepin (25 mg, two times a day) as the antidepressant drugs. Meta-analyses revealed that CSS in combination with antidepressant drugs treatment significantly improved depressive symptoms (WMD = -3.56; 95% CI -5.09 to -2.03) and significantly increased effective rate (OR = 3.31; 95% CI 1.80-6.10) and recovery rate (OR = 2.32; 95% CI 1.61-3.34) compared with antidepressant drugs therapy. In addition, the efficacy of CSS as monotherapy was significantly better than antidepressants in improving depressive symptoms (WMD = -3.09; 95% CI -5.13 to -1.06) and in creasing effective rate (OR = 2.61; 95% CI 1.23-5.53). CSS was comparable to antidepressants in increasing recovery rate (OR = 1.83; 95% CI 0.84-3.98). No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included trials. Conclusion: The present work supported that CSS was effective and safe in treating depressed patients. More full-scale randomized clinical trials with reliable designs are recommended to further evaluate the clinical benefit and long-term effectiveness of CSS for the treatment of depression. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84861213525	Enhanced antitumoral efficacy and immune response following conditionally replicative adenovirus containing constitutive HSF1 delivery to rodent tumors	Background: Oncolytic adenoviruses are promising as anticancer agents but have limited clinical responses. Our previous study showed that heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) overexpression could increase the anti-tumor efficacy of E1B55kD deleted oncolytic adenovirus through increasing the viral burst. Due to the important roles of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in eliciting innate and adaptive immunity, we reasoned that besides increasing the viral burst, HSF1 may also play a role in increasing tumor specific immune response.Methods: In the present study, intra-dermal murine models of melanoma (B16) and colorectal carcinoma (CT26) were treated with E1B55kD deleted oncolytic adenovirus Adel55 or Adel55 incorporated with cHSF1, HSF1i, HSP70, or HSP90 by intra-tumoral injection. Tumors were surgically excised 72 h post injection and animals were analyzed for tumor resistance and survival rate.Results: Approximately 95% of animals in the Adel55-cHSF1 treated group showed sustained resistance upon re-challenge with autologous tumor cells, but not in PBS, Adel55, or Adel55-HSF1i treated groups. Only 50-65% animals in the Adel55-HSP70 and Adel55-HSP90 treated group showed tumor resistance. Tumor resistance was associated with development of tumor type specific cellular immune responses. Adel55-cHSF1 treatment also showed higher efficacy in diminishing progression of the secondary tumor focus than Adel55-HSP70 or Adel55-HSP90 treatment.Conclusions: Besides by increasing its burst in tumor cells, cHSF1 could also augment the potential of E1B55kD deleted oncolytic adenovirus by increasing the tumor-specific immune response, which is beneficial to prevent tumor recurrence. cHSF1 is a better gene for neoadjuvant immunotherapy than other heat shock protein genes. © 2012 Fan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84861962111	The effects of Rhizoma drynariae on interleukin-2 and T-lymphocyte levels in rats after severe head injury	Objective: To investigate the effects of Rhizoma drynariae on the levels of interleukin-2(IL-2) and T-lymphocyte subset in rats with severe head injury (SHI). Methods: 72 Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: control group, model group, and R. drynariae group. The experimental group received intragastrical infusions of with aqueous R. drynariae extract four hours after SHI while the other groups were administered with equivalent volumes of physiological saline. Infusions were administered to the 3 groups once a day for 7 d. IL-2 and T-lymphocyte (CD3, CD4, CD8) levels were measured at 24, 72, and 168 h after initial infusion. Results: The levels of IL-2 and CD4 T cells reduced obviously after 24 h in the model group (P<0.05), but recovered to the levels of the control group after 72 h, and remained elevated after 168 h. In the R. drynariae group, IL-2 and CD4 levels were did not decrease while the level of CD8 T cells was reduced significantly (P<0.05). Conclusions: R. drynariae can protect against immune dysfunction or improve immunity in rats with severe head injury (SHI).

84863290802	Ethnopharmacokinetic- and activity-guided isolation of a new antidepressive compound from Fructus Aurantii found in the traditional Chinese medicine Chaihu-Shugan-San: A new approach and its application	Aims. We aimed to identify an antidepressive compound found in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by a new approach called ethnopharmacokinetic- and activity-guided isolation (EAGI). Methods. The new approach targets an unknown chromatographic peak produced by an absorbed compound found in oral Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS) taken by patients with depression. Once the compound was isolated from Fructus Aurantii (FA), spectral data was employed to identify the compound. The effects of this compound, FA, and CSS on depressive behaviors were investigated. Results. The identified compound was merazin hydrate (MH) according to the new approach. MH, FA, and CSS significantly reduced immobility time and increased locomotor activity. The effects of MH, FA and CSS were similar to Fluoxetine at high doses. Conclusion. MH, a compound whose antidepressive effect is similar to FA and CSS, was isolated for the first time from FA via targeting its corresponding unknown chromatographic peak, and its antidepressive effect was compared with FA or CSS. These findings highlight the potential for drug R&D and pharmacological research of ∼ 100,000TCMs. Copyright 2012 Rong Fan et al.

84866386371	Fructus Aurantii induced antidepressant effect via its monoaminergic mechanism and prokinetic action in rat	Depression could hardly get a satisfactory effect from the currently available antidepressants. To get a more effective treatment, antidepressant effect and monoaminergic mechanism of Fructus Aurantii (FRA) in the rat forced swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT), and its prokinetics were examined. FST and OFT were respectively used to evaluate the antidepressant effect and locomotor activity of FRA. We observed the effects of monoamine receptor antagonists on FRA-induced antidepressant effect in rat. The effects of FRA on intestinal transit, gastric emptying and in vitro jejunum contractile activity were assessed. FRA decreased significantly the immobility time (32.6 ± 8.5, 30.3 ± 5.2 vs 56.4 ± 9.4, all p < 0.01) in FST, dose-dependent increased the locomotor activity (102 ± 17.5, 120 ± 18.5 vs 89 ± 9.8, p < 0.05 or 0.01), significantly accelerated gastric emptying (GE: 48.1 ± 6.3, 39.5 ± 5.7 vs 19.5 ± 3.8, p < 0.01) and intestinal transit (IT: 67.3 ± 9.1, 64.2 ± 6.3 vs 49.1 ± 8.2, p < 0.01) of the semi-liquid meal, compared with vehicle. And FRA (1 μM, 10 μM) significantly increased the mean amplitude (0.24 ± 0.021 and 0.281 ± 0.015) of contraction in jejunum of rat compared with vehicle (0.149 ± 0.011) in vitro. FRA (10 μM) could induce a largest amplitude (0.281 ± 0.015) of contraction in jejunum. The anti-immobility effect of FRA in FST was prevented by pre-treatment of rat with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester, WAY100635, ketanserin, haloperidol, SCH233390, sulpiride, yohimbine, but not prazosin. FRA could simultaneously induce prokinetics and antidepressant effect, deserves further to investigate. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

84872726757	Influence of NF-κB-vasoactive intestinal peptide on intestinal dysmotility in severe acute pancreatitis	To investigated the influence of NF-κB-vasoactive intestinal peptide on intestinal dysmotility in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). 24 male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: sham-operation (SO) group, SAP group and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) group. To calculated intestinal propulsion index, we measured length of the small intestine and intestinal canal labeled by glucan; Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we were used RT-PCR (Real Time-polymerase chain reaction) and used TaqMan fluorescent probes in this experiment. The intestinal propulsion rate (IPR) in SAP group is significantly lower than that in SO group and PDTC group (P < 0.05). Serum VIP in SAP group is significantly higher than that in SO group (P = 0.000). Serum VIP in SAP group is lower than that in PDTC group (P = 0.021). Compared to SO group and PTDC group, VIP of intestinal tissue is significantly low in SAP group (P < 0.05). There was a negative correlation between IPR and VIP. VIP mRNA expression was higher in SAP group than that of SO group (P = 0.019). VIP mRNA expression in PTDC group was lower than that of in SAP group (P = 0.006). When SAP occurred, activation of NF-κB exists in the neuroendocrine cells of secreting VIP, NF-κB inhibit intestinal motility through the promotion of VIP expression. Intestinal motility may be more closely related to intestinal tissue VIP concentration.

84873397342	Meranzin hydrate exhibits anti-depressive and prokinetic-like effects through regulation of the shared alpha 2-adrenoceptor in the brain-gut axis of rats in the forced swimming test	Background: In recent years, the brain-gut axis theory has received increasing attention in studies of depression. However, most studies separately address potential antidepressant and prokinetic treatments. Investigations of drugs that could potentially treat comorbid depression and gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction via a common mechanism of action have not yet been performed in detail. Aim: To find a common mechanism of action of our patented drug, meranzin hydrate (MH), in the antidepressant and prokinetic treatment. Methods: The forced swimming test (FST) model of depression, plasma ghrelin measurement, and in vivo and in vitro measurements of GI motility were used. Results: 1. Administration of MH (9 mg/kg) decreased the immobility time during the FST after acute treatment; this effect was inhibited by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, but not by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. 2. After chronic treatment, the immobility time of rats during the FST was decreased significantly by MH (2.25 mg/kg). 3. MH (9 mg/kg) increased plasma ghrelin levels in rats subjected to the FST; this increase was enhanced by the ghrelin receptor agonist, GHRP-6. 4. MH (9 mg/kg) also promoted gastric emptying and intestinal transit in rats with or without FST. 5. In vitro, MH (10 μM) increased jejunal contractions in rats subjected to the FST; this effect was inhibited by yohimbine. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of yohimbine was partly reversed by the ghrelin receptor agonist, GHRP-6. Conclusion: Our study revealed that MH from natural resources exhibits antidepressive and prokinetic-like effects through the regulation of the common mediator, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84878348636	The involvement of AMPA-ERK1/2-BDNF pathway in the mechanism of new antidepressant action of prokinetic meranzin hydrate	It was recently discovered that ketamine can relieve depression in a matter of hours through an action on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This is much more rapid than the several weeks required for the available antidepressants to show therapeutic efficacy. However, ketamine has negative side effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether the natural prokinetic drug meranzin hydrate (MH) has a fast-acting antidepressant effect mediated by AMPA receptors. By means of in vivo and in vitro experiments, we found that (1) treatment of rats with MH at 9 mg/kg decreased immobility time in a forced swimming test (FST), as did the popular antidepressant fluoxetine and the AMPA receptor positive modulator aniracetam. Pretreatment of rats with NBQX (10 mg/kg), an antagonist of AMPA receptors, blocked this effect of MH. (2) MH increased number of crossings of forced swimming rats in the open field test. (3) FST enhanced hippocampal ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2 and BDNF expression levels. MH (9 mg/kg) treatment further up-regulated hippocampal p-ERK1/2 and BDNF expression levels, and this effect was prevented by NBQX. (4) MH-increased BDNF expression corresponded with MH-decreased immobility time in the FST. (5) In vitro experiments, we found that incubation of rats hippocampus slices with MH (10, 20 μM respectively) increased concentrations of BDNF and p-ERK1/2. This effect of MH (20 μM) were prevented by NBQX. In conclusion, in animals subjected to acute stress, the natural prokinetic drug MH produced a rapid effect mediated by AMPA receptors and involving BDNF modulation through the ERK1/2 pathway. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84883255086	Comparison between the pharmacokinetics of meranzin hydrate in a rat model of chronic depression and in controls following the oral administration of Chaihu-shugan-san	Previous studies have shown that meranzin hydrate (MH) may be beneficial in depressive disorders. However, to the best of our knowledge, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of MH in depression have not previously been investigated. Chronic mild stress (CMS) in rats is used as a model of depression. The present study was designed to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetics of MH in CMS and control rats following the oral administration of Chaihu-Shugan-San (CSS). Rats were randomly divided into CMS and control groups and blood samples were obtained following the oral administration of CSS. The quantification of MH levels in the plasma for pharmacokinetic study was achieved using a simple and rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array (UPLC-PDA) method. Following the oral administration of CSS to CMS rats and controls, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of MH was 58.66±6.64 and 57.54±12.67 ng/ml at 108.00±26.83 and 54.00±8.22 min, respectively. Compared with the value of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)0-1440 in control rats (19,896.76±1,041.95 μg·min/l), the AUC0-1440 value was reduced in CMS rats (18,401.32±4332.65 μg·min/l). There were no significant differences in the majority of the pharmacokinetic parameters of MH, including the values for Cmax, AUC0-1440, clearance rate (CL/F) and mean residence time (MRT0-1440), between the CMS rats and the controls. However, the pharmacokinetic parameters showed that CMS accelerated the absorption of MH in rats following the oral administration of CSS.

Injection of bee venom (BV, 0.1 mg, 50 μl) into the plantar surface of one hind paw resulted in not only a 1-h monophasic PSPR such as flinching reflex in the injected paw and a subsequent period of 3-4 days primary heat and mechanical hyperalgesia, but also a marked sign of inflammation, including redness and swelling of the plantar surface in the injected paw. Intraplantar injection of formalin produced two phases of PSPR as reported previously. Systemic pre-treatment with three doses of IP (0.32, 1.6 and 9.0 ml/kg, 500%) or IS (0.32, 1.6 and 9.0 ml/kg, 250%) produced a dose-dependent suppression of the BV- or formalin-induced flinching reflex of 1 h time course as compared with the saline control group. Post-treatment with IP or IS 5 min after BV injection also produced a significant suppression of the flinching reflex in both BV test and formalin test respectively, as compared with the control group. However, neither pre- nor post-treatment with IP or IS produced any significantly suppressive effect on the BV-induced primary heat and mechanical hyperalgesia and inflammation. The analgesia produced by IP or IS was not mediated by the endogenous opioid receptors since naloxone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, had no reversal effect on the IP and IS-produced analgesia in the BV-induced PSPR. Our present results suggest that IP or IS might prevent and relieve clinical persistent spontaneous pain, but without any anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects on the primary heat hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia, as well as inflammatory responses. The BV test might be a useful model of pain to evaluate and screen anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of certain compounds of the Chinese medicinal herbs on the pathological origins of pain.

84901767498	Anti-inflammatory effects of the bioactive compound ferulic acid contained in oldenlandia diffusa on collagen-induced arthritis in rats	Objectives. This study aimed to identify the active compounds in Oldenlandia diffusa (OD) decoction and the compounds absorbed into plasma, and to determine whether the absorbed compounds derived from OD exerted any anti-inflammatory effects in rats with collagen induced arthritis (CIA). Methods. The UPLC-PDA (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography Photo-Diode Array) method was applied to identify the active compounds both in the decoction and rat plasma. The absorbable compound was administered to the CIA rats, and the effects were dynamically observed. X-ray films of the joints and HE stain of synovial tissues were analyzed. The levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the rats from each group were measured by means of ELISA. The absorbed compound in the plasma of CIA rats was identified as ferulic acid (FA), following OD decoction administration. Two weeks after the administration of FA solution or OD decoction, the general conditions improved compared to the model group. The anti-inflammatory effect of FA was inferior to that of the OD decoction (P < 0.05), based on a comparison of IL-1β TNF-α levels. FA from the OD decoction was absorbed into the body of CIA rats, where it elicited anti-inflammatory responses in rats with CIA. Conclusions. These results suggest that FA is the bioactive compound in OD decoction, and FA exerts its effects through anti-inflammatory pathways. © 2014 Hao Zhu et al.

84910086621	Influence of Ar-ions irradiation on the oxidation behavior of ferritic-martensitic steel P92 in supercritical water	The corrosion behavior of ferritic-marensitic steel P92 with and without Ar-ions irradiation in supercritical water at 823 K(550 °C)/25 MPa for different exposure times was investigated by a variety of characterization techniques. A distinct difference in oxidation morphology between irradiated and unirradiated samples was observed. The oxide morphology of samples with a relatively moderate radiation intensity was similar with that of samples without irradiation. Many small oxide particles were observed in the region with a relatively high radiation intensity but their size was increased gradually with increasing exposure times. Exfoliation of oxide layer occurred for irradiated samples exposed for 100 h. Chromium-rich oxide layer with a chromium content of more than 20 wt pct along with a small-scale three-layer oxide structures were observed in Ar-ions irradiated samples, arising from the microstructural change in steel samples after the irradiation. Mechanism for the exfoliation of oxide layer is also discussed.
