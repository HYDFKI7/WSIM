24944475522	Cloning and characterization of the microspore development-related gene BcMF2 in Chinese cabbage pak-choi (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino)	For the sake of providing some important information relevant to the study of the molecular mechanism of genic male sterility in plants, gene differential expression in flower buds at different developmental stages, as well as in rosette leaves, florescence leaves, and scapes was analyzed using cDNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) in the genic male sterile A and fertile B line of Chinese cabbage pak-choi. Following amplification of 125 pairs of primer combinations, 11 differential fragments were obtained, of which eight were from the B line and the other three were from the A line. Of 11 differential fragments, four were verified by Northern hybridization that were expressed preferentially in fertile flower buds. Results of GenBank BLAST showed that one fragment was with unknown function, whereas the other fragments have strong nucleotide sequence similarities with the polygalacturonase (PG) gene, the pectinesterase (PE) gene, and the polygalacturonase inhibitory protein (PGIP4) gene. Only full-length cDNA from the differential fragment BcMF-Al8Tl6-1 was amplified by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and Northern analysis showed that this fragment was expressed only in medium and large-sized flower buds of the B line. The full-length cDNA, designated as BcMF2 (Brassica campestris Male Fertile 2), was 1 485 bp long and was composed of a 1 263-bp open reading frame, which had 83% nucleotide similarity to a PG gene from Arabidopsis encoding polygalacturonase. Analysis of the basic structure of the protein revealed that it had one polygalacturonase active site (RVTCGPGHGLSVGS) at 256th site of amino acids and was classified as being a member of family 28 of the glycosyl hydrolases. The role of the BcMF2 gene on microspore development is discussed in the present paper.

30344451701	Functional analysis of a novel male fertility CYP86MF gene in Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis makino)	In our earlier work, a cytochrome P450 CYP86MF gene was isolated from floral bud of Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino, syn. B. rapa L.) by mRNA differential display PCR (DD-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). To unravel the biological function of CYP86MF gene, the antisense fragment from the CYP86MF gene was transferred into Chinese cabbage pak-choi (B. campestris ssp. chinensis var. communis Tsen et Lee). Out of 22 plants transformed with the antisense gene constructed from the CYP86MF, 20 reached to flowering stage. Morphological investigations showed that the transgenic plants developed the normal floral organ. However, they remained self-infertile, even when artificial self-pollination was performed in the bud stage. Pollen germination test indicated that the pollen from the transgenic line TB-2 could not germinate normally. Further physiological, biochemical and cytological analyses showed that only significant difference was detectable in contents of the endogenous hormones, and a layer of unknown material adhered to the surface of microspore. The present studies thus provided valuable clues for understanding the biological function of the CYP86C subfamily genes. Furthermore, our studies also demonstrate a novel method for obtaining artificial male sterility line of Chinese cabbage. Â© Springer-Verlag 2005.

33645640106	Studies on environmental friendly lubricants and its ecotoxicity for outboard engine	The experimental study on ecotoxicity of TC-W3 environmental friendly lubricants for outboard engine was made by applying luminescent bacteria as subjects. The experimental results show that base oil modulated by tri-methylol-propane-ester (TMP) has characteristics of low ecotoxicity and high lubricity. On the contrary, the base oil mainly composed of traditional mineral oil, which has high ecotoxicity can hardly meet the requirement of the indexes of low ecotoxicity if they are massively added. The ecotoxicity of lubricants is mainly decided by the ecotoxicity of additives, which varied dramatically, therefore it is essential to develop ecotoxicity of environmental friendly lubricants by reasonablely using additives and its proper proportion. Low ecotoxicity and biodegradable TC-W3 environmental friendly lubricants was prepared by selecting and proportioning tests to the base oil and additives. The indexes of TC-W3 lubricant meet the requirement of the designation by means of biodegradable and ecotoxicity tests.

The results show that nanometal additives have certain amount of ecotoxicity, which is on the rise with the increased adding proportion. If nanometal additives are added into varied lubricants, their ecotoxicity changes differently. Owing to the difference of luminescent bacteria to sensitivity and toxicity mechanism of different metals, the ecotoxicity of 4 typical nanometal additives varies accordingly. Among them, Zn's and Cu's are relatively high in comparison with other mentioned metals. Due to synergistic effect of the metals, is the ecotoxicity increased dramatically if several kinds of nano-metals mixed together.

Various doses (5-100 Gy) of gamma rays were applied to investigate the effect of radiation on adventitious bud formation from bulb-scales and the survival rate of plantlets. It was demonstrated that the regeneration of Chinese narcissus was very sensitive to gamma radiation even at low doses. The survival and multiplication rate significantly decreased with an increase of radiation dose. The optimal irradiation dose for survival and mutation induction was approximately 10 Gy. The genetic variations among the regenerants derived from irradiated explants were evaluated by DNA fingerprinting using RAPD and AFLP markers which detected a variation frequency of 8.33% and 15.48% respectively. The high frequency of mutants detected by molecular markers indicated that treatment of in vitro cultures with Î³-rays may be an effective way to improve narcissus cultivars.

The experiments were conducted on a heavy-duty diesel engine and five fuels were used, namely: E0 (base diesel fuel), E5 (5%), E10 (10%), E15 (15%) and E20 (20%), respectively. The regulated emissions (THC, CO, NOx, PM) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions were measured, and Ames test and Comet assay, respectively, were used to investigate the mutagenicity and genotoxicity of particulate extracts. From the point of exhaust emissions, the introduction of ethanol to diesel fuel could result in higher brake specific THC (BSTHC) and CO (BSCO) emissions and lower smoke emissions, while the effects on the brake specific NOx (BSNOx) and particulate matters (BSPM) were not obvious. The PAH emissions showed an increasing trend with a growth of ethanol content in the ethanol-diesel blends. As to the biotoxicity, E20 always had the highest brake specific revertants (BSR) in both TA98 and TA100 with or without metabolizing enzymes (S9), while the lowest BSR were found in E5 except that of TA98 - S9.

TEM examinations indicated that plastic deformation occurred within both a and Î²phases in the STA specimens testing at either room or cryogenic temperature. The dominant deformation mechanism varied from dislocation slip at room temperature to twinning at 123K. SEM observations showed that the amount of dimples and tearing grains on fractured surfaces of the specimens decreased as testing temperature was decreased.

The results show that the particulates during combustion process present two morphologies; one is the representative particulate which formed through agglomeration of small sphere-like primary carbon particles; and the other is amorphous particulate containing abundant metal elements mainly coming from the lubricant and non-metal element, and these particulate had definite structure and existed cross the whole combustion process. The representative particles are aggregated in the form of fractal-like geometry. The fractal dimension is in a range of 1.2 to 1.74, and it decreases at the early period of the diffusive combustion.

The dominating set problem is one of the classical NP-complete problems and fits into broader class of domination problems. The authors provide the detailed algorithms, which have been very recently obtained, and illustrations for the domination problems in arbitrary graphs including minimum dominating set, maximum independent set, minimum independent dominating set, minimum connected dominating set and minimum weighted dominating set for the purpose of making the paper be self-contained and easy reading. Several techniques such as Branch & Reduce, Complexity analysis, Measure & Conquer, Memorization and so on are also discussed. After a long period of silence since Claude Berge formulated for the first time of modern conception of domination, the interest in design of exact exponential time algorithms has been growing significantly within the last five years. In addition to present a view of the latest results, the authors also hope more domestic research communities would pay attention to this rapidly developed field of research.

In order to adapt to the hardware sources especially energy source restrictions of 6LoWPAN, we propose S-AODV (Sink Routing Table over AODV) routing, a new AODV implementation designed to provide benefits in terms of traffic reduction, power consumption and networks lifetime extension, for 6LoWPAN in this paper. In S-AODV, traffic of route discovery in original AODV is reduced by using SRT (Sink Routing Table).

The analytical result revealed that 13 kinds of CBCs could be determined accurately by this method. The brake specific CBCs emissions (BSCE) of methanol-containing diesel amounted to 15.2-332.1 mg/(kWÂ·h), which were 1.49-3.24 times as much as those of neat diesel. Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde constituted the highest contents among CBCs emissions, followed by acrolein, acetone and propionaldehyde. These 5 kinds of CBCs accounted for more than 80% of the BSCE. With the increase of brake mean effective pressure, the BSCE were observed to decrease significantly apart from hexaldehyde and propionaldehyde from neat diesel.

44349097043	Suppressive effect of silicon nutrient on Phomopsis stem blight development in asparagus	The effects of silicon nutrition on the resistance to stem blight caused by Phomopsis asparagi was assessed in two asparagus cultivars, UC157 and Gynlim, and the activation of defense responses in inoculated plants was measured in a greenhouse with nutrient solution culture. The supply of silicon (Si) significantly suppressed stem blight development in inoculated plants. The disease index was significantly reduced in Si-supplied plants compared with Si-deprived plants in both cultivars. Supplement with Si enhanced Si accumulation in asparagus root and shoot. Si content was significantly higher in Si-treated plants when compared with control plants, but it was not significantly different between the two cultivars. Interestingly, inoculation with P. asparagi increased Si content in shoots in the cultivar UC157. Root-applied Si significantly enhanced the activities of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) such as catalase, peroxidase, polyphenoloxidase, and Î²-1, 3-glucanase in inoculated plants. However, Si treatment mostly failed to change significantly the activity of PRs in plants without fungal attack. So continuous feeding of Si to the plant is probably important for enhancing the resistance to infection by P. asparagi in asparagus.

46749132733	A novel fiber optical device for ultraviolet disinfection of water	Since there are several problems in traditional UV disinfection techniques, a highly efficient, reliable and economical method, using quartz optical fibers to deliver UV light is proposed. The principle of the experimental setup is that ultraviolet rays are gathered by a reflector and converge on a light point, the diameter of approximately 5 mm. In this way UV light can be transferred into water to kill the bacteria in the water. This paper presents preliminary results on water disinfection using this new UV disinfection setup. Its suitability for application could be shown in experiments with E. coli (ATCC8099) as test microorganisms. We have optimized the distribution of the optical fibers in the water in bench-scale study. This result can provide guidance for pilot-scale and field-scale study of this new technique. The results show that the new technique had a good performance under different conditions as follows: (a) turbidity level = 10.2 NTU, (b) ferric ion concentration = 0.3 mg/L, and (c) humic acid concentration = 5 mg/L.

47149107214	Unit maintenance scheduling coordination mechanism in electricity market environment	Along with worldwide electricity market deregulation, the traditional approach to unit maintenance scheduling (UMS) is required to make compatible changes for resolving some new challenges. The development of workable coordination mechanism to accord with the market mechanism is under the close concern of the policymaker, the market designer and the market participants. Actually, the key of this problem is both how to treat generation companies equally and how to guarantee the system security during the UMS process. This paper advances the view on UMS in electricity market environment, and identifies that the coordination fairness should include 'which plans to be selected for adjustment' and 'how to adjust them' simultaneously, of which only the former was comprehensively studied in the past research, however. To ensure the competition fairness thoroughly, a new kind of UMS mechanism with a coordination model is constructed. The transmission capacity constraint and the random line outage are involved in the model in order to make the analysis about the impact of UMS on the system security more reasonable. In addition, the adequate solution for this model and the allocation way about the independent system operator's income which is created during UMS process have also been discussed. Then the proposed mechanism is applied to a numerical example to show its good features in practical application. Â© 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It is unnecessary to artificially give an initial iteration value. The iteration process of this method can converge steadily to a unique minimum point in the domain of parameter and can not fall into the trap of the minimum point. This method requires a little storage and can converge rapidly. This is a globally optimized algorithm and can derive a rheological parameter estimation, showing superior statistic features including near unbiasedness of fitting residual error and almost least variance. The calculation cases, using a large amount of practical drilling fluid dada, indicate that the new method has smaller fitting variance, more similar mean value and more superior statistical feature of fitting residual error than the linear regression. This method can be used to determine the rheological parameter in Casson model of drilling fluid, optimize rheological model, adjust and evaluate the performance of drilling fluid.

Methods: Twelve patients with high-voltage electrical burn in occipital and nuchal regions were hospitalized to our ward from March 2003 to September 2007. They were repaired with improved inferior trapezius myocutaneous flaps after debridement. Flaps were of two types: (1) blood supply from cutaneous and perforator branches of the original segment of the superficial descending branch of transverse cervical artery. (2) combined blood supply from both superficial and deep descending branches of transverse cervical artery(ie dorsal scapular artery.). All flaps carried segmental and limited trapezius muscle cuff surrounding the vascular pedicle of the flap similar to a perforator flap. Results: Flaps survived completely primarily in eight cases. In two patients, infection developed in flaps adjacent to wounds with liquification; they healed after dress change. Necrosis appeared in distal end of flap (one case),and it healed after re-operation. One patient with surviving flaps died of sepsis and multiple organ failure 21 days after operation. The flaps which survived were not swollen; the donor sites at scapular region looked normal without pterygoid or pendulous scapula deformities. Conclusion: Inferior trapezius myocutaneous flaps can be used to repair occipital and nuchal wounds, with the advantages of constant blood vessels, reliable blood supply,convenience for application.

Fracture surfaces of the fatigued specimens and the microstructures in regions adjacent to fracture surface were examined by scanning election microscopy (SEM) and transmission election microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the fatigue strength of Ti-6A1-4V alloy decreased in the order of the following conditions: in vacuum at cryogenic temperature, in vacuum at RT and in air at RT. The longest fatigue life of the alloy could be obtained in vacuum at cryogenic temperature, while the shortest one in air at room temperature. Crack initiation site, crack prorogation path and rapid failure zone were distinguishable on the fractured surfaces of the specimens fatigued either in air or in vacuum at room and cryogenic temperatures. Generally, the fatigue cracks initiated at the surface of the specimens and many dimples could be found in the rapid failure zone.

68249083213	A new method of non-linear least square estimation of rheological parameter for drilling fluid	The estimation problem of rheological parameter for drilling fluid usually resorts to the linear regression method to get the solution. As a result, the statistic feature of measurement error becomes different, and the derived rheological parameter estimation tends to be no unbiasedness and with the least variance. A new method of non-linear least square estimation is proposed according to the characteristics of three non-linear rheological equations. There is no need to give an initial iteration value artificially. The iteration process can converge steadily to a unique minimum point without falling into the minimum point trap. Little storage space is in need but with a rapid convergence. A rheological parameter estimation derived on the basis of the algorithm presents superior statistic features of near unbiasedness of fitting residual error and with almost the least variance. Lots of practical drilling fluid cases validate that the new method is of smaller fitting variance with the similar mean, and a superior statistical feature of fitting residual error over that of linear regression.

Numerical simulation of phase current of different control parameters are in good agreement with the test results of prototype manufactured. It was found that the effective starting control of constant torque was achieved by fixing the chopping level and turn-off delay time under condition of low speed starting, and constant power starting control was also realized by regulating the turn-on and turn-off position under high speed starting condition.

In this CMS plants, all floral organs are normal except the anthers, which are transformed into petals or tubular structures. Recently, 2 mitochondrial genes-atpA and orf220-that are distinctively present in the CMS line of tuber mustard were cloned and partially characterized. In our study of genetic diversity analysis of CMS, 7 species of Brassica and Raphanus crops, which included 5 CMS lines and their respective maintainer lines, were used to compare the constitution of protein-coding genes in the mitochondrial genomes. In 4 of the 43 mitochondrial genes, namely, atpA, orf220, orf256, and orf305/orf324, polymorphisms were detected among the tuber mustard CMS line and its maintainer line. The results of a cluster analysis indicate that petaloid CMS phenotype of tuber mustard is a novel CMS type and is nearer to the nap CMS in Brassica napus at the phylogenetic level. The results of individual amplifications of these genes indicate the presence of 4 sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers, which enable rapid and reliable identification of this CMS. Expressions of the orf220 and orf256 genes were detected only in the CMS line, while expression of the orf305 gene was detected in the maintainer line. The different expression patterns of different mitochondrial-specific marker genes indicate that the quantity of mitochondrial proteins is differentially regulated during organ/tissue development in tuber mustard. The results of this study suggest that the above mentioned 4 mitochondrial genes are associated with the petaloid CMS phenotype in tuber mustard. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

In SRT protocol, nodes aggregate data and use energy aware neighbor selection to route packets towards the target along an optimal path, each common node has no need to maintain a routing table, sink node maintain one instead. Our simulation results show that SRT is robust on large-scale networks and works well in the face of uneven network load and energy consumption. Â© 2010 IEEE.

77953061044	PEGASIS protocol in wireless sensor network based on an improved ant colony algorithm	This paper proposes a routing protocol for the applications of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). It is a protocol based on the PEGASIS protocol but using an improved ant colony algorithm rather than the greedy algorithm to construct the chain. Compared with the original PEGASIS, this one, PEG-ant, can achieve a global optimization. It forms a chain that makes the path more even-distributed and the total square of transmission distance much less. Moreover, in the constructing process, the energy factor has been taken into account, which brings about a balance of energy consumption between nodes. In each round of transmission, according to the current energy of each node, a leader is selected to directly communicate with the base station (BS). Simulation results have show that the proposed protocol significantly prolongs the network lifetime. Â© 2010 IEEE.

77953999831	A segment model for energy-saving electricity markets	An improper design on the mechanism or operating mode of energy-saving generation dispatching (ESGD) could bring negative effects on the development and operation of electricity markets. Consequently, how to make an appropriate coordination between the objective of ESGD and the role of electricity markets in optimizing resource allocation is then a very important issue to be investigated in China. A segment model for energy-saving electricity markets is developed in this work for this purpose. At first, the principles on ESGD designing and the scope for its implementation are analyzed, and then a segment model is presented with the objective of decreasing the ESGD's negative effects on the electricity market development and operation, while respecting the given target of energy-saving and loss reduction. A stochastic optimization formulation for optimizing the segment model of energy-saving electricity markets is built in the framework of the well-established chance-constrained programming, with an objective of compromising the electricity purchasing cost minimization and the social welfare maximization. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the essential features of the developed segment model and the effectiveness of the chance-constrained programming based method.

77954412404	A comprehensive routing protocol in wireless sensor network based on ant colony algorithm	This paper proposes a comprehensive routing protocol (CRP) based on the ant colony algorithm for the applications of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). It is a protocol taking both the lifetime of network and the arrival rate of data packet into account. In CRP, multiple paths are found between source and destination, and sub-optimal paths are used occasionally referring to the probabilistic forwarding table to provide substantial gains. To ascertain the probability of the candidate node to be chosen as the next forwarding one, these factors such as the remained energy of the node, the square of distance between it and the current node, and the strength of pheromone on this branch are considered to balance the energy consumption between nodes. Moreover, to guarantee the success of message transmission, the reputation of nodes on the routing path is critical. Therefore, the frequency a node acting as a router which represents its reputation is also considered as one of the decision factors. Simulation results have shown that the proposed protocol not only prolongs the network lifetime, but also decreases the packet loss rate. Â© 2010 IEEE.

77955745056	A novel regenerative braking method of BLDCM for wheeled mobile robot	This paper proposes a novel regenerative braking method of Brushless DC Motor (BLDCM) for Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR). The drive servo system is converted into a parallel-connected boost circuit to brake and store power without changing any hardware device, and the chopping frequency of the stator phase current is twice as high as the traditional methods with same switch frequency, so the swing range of stator phase current is reduced evidently, at the same time, it minifies the pulse of braking torque, and the performance of regenerative braking is improved greatly. In addition, the relation of the stator phase voltage, the duty ratio of switch and the boosted voltage is discussed detailedly, and the explanation of this method is presented in theory. In order to verify the concept, a simulation and an experiment prototype of a BLDCM for WMR were built. Under the same conditions that motor speed is 250 rad/s, gear ratio is 36:1, and the braking torque is 0.1 Nm, the stator phase current waveform acquired by utilizing the regenerative braking method proposed in this paper is contrasted with the one acquired by utilizing the traditional method, the results proved that the novel method has high performance as well as simplicity and reliability, and provides an excellent solution for BLDCM to brake.

77955016538	Virtual grounding identification technology in neutral point non-effectively grouned system	Zero-sequence voltage will rise when single-phase-to-earth occurs in neutral point non-grounded system. So it is with the resonance in the above said system. Traditional line selection equipment will start only when zero-sequence voltage and current exceed set value. As they could not tell the difference between single-phase-to-earth and resonance, malfunction may be caused. After study of theory, characteristics of PT ferroresonance and line broken resonance of arc-suppression coil are emphatically analyzed, three-phase voltage and zero-sequence voltage in case of single-phase grounding and resonance are compared with each other in detail. On this basis, the technology is put forward based on comprehensive comparison of zero-sequence voltage and three-phase voltage. The technology is verified by field data, which reveals that the technology could effectively increase the reliability of line selection equipment and therefore could satisfy the practical requirements.

0036660399	Study on thickening and toughening modification of ethyl Î±-cyanoacrylate adhesive with NBR	The effect of mass fraction of acrylonitrile and relative molecule mass of NBR on the apparent viscosity of Î±-cyanoacrylate adhesive and the tensile shear strength, impact shear strength of the adhesive adhint was investigated. The micromorphology of cured modified Î±-adhesive was observed by photomicrograph. The result showed that the less the mass fraction of acrylonitrile in NBR was, the better the thickness was. But the less relative molecule mass of NBR was on the contrary in thickness. The thickening and toughening properties of Î±-adhesive was obviously improved by blending 9% of NBR, with acrylonitrile mass fraction 26%, milling 40 times, and the diameter of the particle of NBR 26 was 5-10 Î¼m.

84856431583	ARGET ATRP of methyl methacrylate with 2-(8-heptadecenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H- imidazole-1-ethylamine (OLC) as both ligand and reducing agent in the presence of air	Copper(II)-mediated activators regenerated by electron transfer for atom transfer radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was successfully carried out in a limited amount of air in the presence of 2-(8-heptadecenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-1H-Imidazole-1-ethylamine as ligand that served not only as ligand but also as reducing agents. Reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) by an excess amount of nitrogen-based ligand was followed by UV-visible spectroscopy. The kinetics of the polymerizations and effect of different polymerization conditions are investigated. It is found that the polymerization of MMA can be conducted well even if the amount of Cu(II) is as low as 1 mol% catalyst relative to initiator. The results of the polymerizations demonstrate the features of "living'/controlled free-radical polymerization, such as the number-average molecular weights being close to their corresponding theoretical values and increasing linearly with monomer conversion, and narrow molecular weight distributions. Chain extension of poly(methyl methacrylate)s with MMA was successful and demonstrated well-maintained end-group functionality. Â© Springer-Verlag 2010.
