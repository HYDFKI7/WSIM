9444243917	Motion path synthesis for intelligent avatar	In this paper, we present a new motion generation technique, called motion path synthesis. The objective is to generate a motion for an intelligent avatar to move along a planned route using a pre-existing motion library. First, motion primitives, each defined as a dynamic motion segment, are extracted from the motion library. Then a motion graph is constructed based on the motion primitives and their connectivities. Within this motion graph, the desired realistic motion for avatars can be synthesized through a two-stage process: search an optimal motion path within the motion graph, joint the motion path and adapt it to the route. The experiment shows the effectiveness of the presented technique.

3242726609	New algorithm for 3D facial model reconstruction and its application in virtual reality	3D human face model reconstruction is essential to the generation of facial animations that is widely used in the field of virtual reality (VR). The main issues of 3D facial model reconstruction based on images by vision technologies are in twofold: one is to select and match the corresponding features of face from two images with minimal interaction and the other is to generate the realistic-looking human face model. In this paper, a new algorithm for realistic-looking face reconstruction is presented based on stereo vision. Firstly, a pattern is printed and attached to a planar surface for camera calibration, and corners generation and corners matching between two images are performed by integrating modified image pyramid Lucas-Kanade (PLK) algorithm and local adjustment algorithm, and then 3D coordinates of corners are obtained by 3D reconstruction. Individual face model is generated by the deformation of general 3D model and interpolation of the features. Finally, realistic-looking human face model is obtained after texture mapping and eyes modeling. In addition, some application examples in the field of VR are given. Experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm is robust and the 3D model is photo-realistic.

84897000334	Feature-based opacity modulation for direct volume rendering	Direct volume rendering (DVR) is an effective method for volumetric data visualization, while it usually needs a transfer function that assigns different optical properties such as color and opacity to the voxels. However, to find a good transfer function is time consuming, since it generally requires the considerable expertise of the user. In this paper, we present feature-based opacity modulation for DVR.

The opacity of these sampling points will be associated with the number of features of the ray. In order to achieve maximum visibility of the farthest sampling points, we modify the traditional ray integral for DVR.

The classified volume data is used to establish the membership volume among different tissues according to the scalar range and their spatial information. Finally, we use layer peeling with the membership volume to explore specific tissues, and the occlusion among the same type of tissues is solved. In addition, an adaptive ray-casting algorithm is employed to improve the quality and speed.

In this paper, we present a novel approach of MLS Cartoon Character Deformation Driven by Skeleton. Firstly, the underlying 2D shape for the character is extracted and triangulated into a mesh. Then the skeleton is constructed according to the topology information of 2D shape and binded to the underlying model automatically. Finally, the 2D shape is animated by using MLS deformation with the adjustment of the joints in the skeleton. In our approach, every vertex is bounded to the corresponding skeleton, and it can not be affected by other points. Thus, our method eliminates the local distortions in the characters and enhances the realisticness of the animation. The experimental results have demonstrated that our deformation approach can produce higher quality of deformation than previous method, and it can be widely used in cartoon animation.

84878314877	Topic hypergraph: Hierarchical visualization of thematic structures in long documents	Thematic information of a long document (i.e., a novel) can be multi-faceted: an interleaving of multiple topics, a sequential evolution of a set of themes, or a crossing superimposition of topics and themes. Conventional topic-based visualization approaches are inefficient to capture this complicated thematic structure. This paper introduces a novel topic-based model, called the topic hypergraph, that characterizes the thematic structure of a long document with a hypergraph representation. Each hypergraph node represents a unique document piece, and encodes its theme as a composition of multiple topics. Two types of relationships among nodes are modeled: an edge that connects two consecutive themes to present their sequential transition, and a hyperedge that encodes a topic. The new representation is essentially a 2D reformulation of the linear streamgraph representation, and can be adaptive by constructing a multi-level hierarchy. We design a suite of visualization and interaction tools to allow users to interactively analyze the theme evolution, theme diversities, and topic interleaving.

The method includes a map view to show the geographical information of houses using location-based clustering, a stacked graph view to show the evolution of house sale over time with combinations of various layouts and orderings, a pixel-bar view to visualize multiple attributes of houses using sale and price-based clustering, and a treemap view to present the hierarchal structure of the data with combinations of various nodes layouts and orderings. Rich user interactions are further proposed to enhance the flexibility and analytical ability of the entire system. We have applied our method to the real property market data and obtained some interesting findings. The feedback from the end users of our system is very positive.

0041730557	A new algorithm for 3D facial model reconstruction and its application in VR	3D human facial model reconstruction is essential to generation of facial animations that is widely used in the field of virtual reality. The main issues of 3D facial model reconstruction based on images are in twofold: one is to track the features of face automatically and the other is to get the realistic-looking human face model. In this paper, we introduce a method on structure from motion. First the accurate corner matches can be acquired by integrating modified image pyramid Lucas-Kanade algorithm and local adjustment algorithm, then a realistic-looking model is generated by camera calibration, motion analysis and texture mapping. Experimental results demonstrate, the high accuracy of the corner matching algorithm and the vividness of the facial model.

0242552454	Individual face expressions and expression cloning	We develop a system to generate individual facial expression with minimal interactions, and expression cloning can be created for different 3D mesh model. In our system, Expressions can be created with the muscle model, and muscular vectors adhere to the vertex in 3D mesh face model. Expressions can be generated after deforming the muscular vectors and rotation angle of jaw parameter and rotation angle of eyes. New approach for expression cloning for different 3D models is presented, radical based function (RBF) is employed to match the vertices of 3D source model and destination model, the cloning expression is obtained by deforming the proportioned muscular vector model. Cloned expression animations preserve the relative motions, dynamics, and character of the original facial animations. If manual tuning or computational costs are high in creating animations for one model, creating similar animations for new models will take similar efforts. Experimental results show the high vividness of our system.

0242721556	Real-time facial features tracker with motion estimation and feedback	Real-time face tracking automatically is a great challenge in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. We develop a system to track face automatically by integrating auto-generation of features of first frame, feature correspondence and Kalman filter based on face attribution and motion estimation. First, Facial features of the first frame are acquired automatically by face detachment and Plessey corner detector according to FDP in MPEG-4 based on anatomical knowledge and general 3D model. And then feature correspondence is obtained by maximizing the cross-correlation, and Kalman filter. Face detection automatically makes full use of the knowledge of 3D general model and face attribute, and face tracking is more efficient by using motion estimation. Experimental results show the high prospect of this algorithm.

0242721559	3D facial animation from Chinese text	The reality and controllability of the facial animation are enhanced in our work by modeling mouth in a parametric approach described by 7 parameters: superior and anterior bend for upper and lower lip, width of the mouth, weight of radium of lips. These parameters were calculated by tracking only 4 points around the mouth from video, and the cost of computation is low. The coarticulation model of Cohen and Massaro was adopted to generate the natural key frames and the transitional frames. Considering the difference between Chinese and English, an algorithm was introduced to calculate the coefficients of dominance functions. Based on the muscle-based facial model and the parametric mouth model, the 3D head can talk vividly.

0242721952	3D realistic talking face co-driven by text and speech	To create 3D realistic talking face has been a challenge for a long time. Previous works emphasize text or speech driven talking face respectively while the animation result is not very realistic or natural-looking. In the proposed approach, text and speech are considered to drive the 3D talking face coordinately. The text is translated into a sequence of visemes' transcription. And time vector of the sequence is extracted from the speech corresponding to the text after it is segmented into phonetic sequence. A muscle based viseme vector is defined for static viseme. And then, with the time vector and the static visemes's sequence, dynamic visemes are generated through time-related dominance function. Finally, according to the frame rate to be rendered, intermediate frames are interpolated between key frames to make the animation results looks more natural and realistic than those obtained based on the text or speech-driven only.

84891630422	Research on the conjugate gradient algorithm with a modified incomplete Cholesky preconditioner on GPU	In this study, we discover the parallelism of the forward/backward substitutions (FBS) for two cases and thus propose an efficient preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm with the modified incomplete Cholesky preconditioner on the GPU (GPUMICPCGA). For our proposed GPUMICPCGA, the following are distinct characteristics: (1) the vector operations are optimized by grouping several vector operations into single kernels, (2) a new kernel of inner product and a new kernel of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication with high optimization are presented, and (3) an efficient parallel implementation of FBS on the GPU (GPUFBS) for two cases are suggested. Numerical results show that our proposed kernels outperform the corresponding ones presented in CUBLAS or CUSPARSE, and GPUFBS is almost 3 times faster than the implementation of FBS using the CUSPARSE library. Furthermore, GPUMICPCGA has better behavior than its counterpart implemented by the CUBLAS and CUSPARSE libraries. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84892707463	A quantum-inspired artificial immune system for the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem	For solving the multiobjective 0-1 knapsack problem (MKP), a novel quantum-inspired artificial immune system (MOQAIS) is presented. The proposed algorithm is composed of a quantum-inspired artificial immune algorithm (QAIS) and an artificial immune system (BAIS). On one hand, QAIS, based on Q-bit representation, is responsible for exploration of the search space by using clone, mutation with a chaos-based rotation gate, update operation of Q-gate. On the other hand, BAIS, based on binary representation, is applied for exploitation of the search space with clone, a reverse mutation. Most importantly, two diversity schemes, suppression algorithm and truncation algorithm with similar individuals (TASI), are employed to preserve the diversity of the population, and a new selection scheme based on TASI is proposed to create the new population. Simulation results on MKP with 12 different test data show that MOQAIS is able to find a much better spread of solutions and has better convergence compared to a quantum-inspired multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (QMEA), a hybrid quantum genetic algorithm (HQGA), a weight-based multiobjective artificial immune system (WBMOAIS), an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and an immune clonal algorithm only for MKP (ICMOA). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84893225575	Personalized 3-D facial expression synthesis based on landmark constraint	With the development of computer technology, 3-D facial expression synthesis has been an important and challenging task in the field of computer animation. Since the faces generated by previous works lack of personalization, we propose a novel approach for 3-D facial expression synthesis based on nonlinear learning. Firstly, a pre-process alignment is performed for input 2-D or 3-D faces with landmarks based on cylindrical mapping, and the intrinsic representations of faces are generated using radial basis function network. Secondly, according to the low dimensional representations of input faces, reconstruction operations are carried out to synthesize 3-D face expressions by sharing linear combination coefficients. Finally, the output 3-D face expressions are further optimized by its corresponding landmarks both in 2-D and 3-D spaces using locality-constrained linear coding. The experimental results indicate the robustness and effectiveness of our facial expression synthesis approach. © 2013 APSIPA.

84894524927	Counting crowd flow based on feature points	A counting approach for crowd flow based on feature points is proposed. The objective is to obtain the characteristics of the crowd flow in a scene, including the crowd orientation and numeric count. For the feature point detection, a three-frame difference algorithm is used to obtain a foreground containing only the moving objects. Therefore, after the SURF feature point detection, only the feature points of the foreground are retained for further processing. This greatly reduces the time complexity of the SURF algorithm. For feature point clustering, we present an improved DBSCAN clustering algorithm in which the non-motion feature points are further eliminated and only the remaining feature points are clustered. For the calculation of the crowd flow orientation, the feature points are tracked based on a local Lucas-Kanade optical flow with Hessian matrix algorithm. In the crowd flow number counting, the crowd eigenvectors are constructed based on the SURF feature points and are trained using a support vector regression machine. The experimental results show that the proposed crowd orientation and counting method are more robust and provide crowd flow statistics with higher accuracy than previous approaches. © 2014.

84898081170	Oriented boundary padding for iterative and oriented fringe pattern denoising techniques	Optical interferometric techniques offer non-contact, high accuracy and full filed measurement, which are very attractive in various research and application fields. Fringe patterns are the recorded results of these techniques and often require denoising at the pre-processing step to increase the accuracy and robustness of information retrieval. Among various fringe pattern denoising techniques, iterative and oriented denoising techniques based on partial differential equations in the spatial domain are effective and widely used. However, these techniques introduce errors near boundary areas if traditional image padding methods such as zero padding and symmetric padding are used. Due to a large number of iterations needed in these techniques, the error will flood from the boundary into the inner part of the fringe pattern. Since fringe patterns have a flow-like structure represented by fringe orientation, padding along the fringe orientation helps to reduce the error. An oriented padding method is thus proposed for iterative and oriented fringe pattern denoising techniques that require partial derivative estimations. Simulated fringe patterns are tested and quantitative results are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results are also given for verification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84899527429	Embedding temporal display into maps for occlusion-free visualization of spatio-Temporal data	It is often necessary to analyze spatio-Temporal data such as traffic flow, air pollution, and vehicle trajectories in a city. A map is often used to show the spatial context while various temporal displays like time series plots can be used to present the changes in the data over time. In this paper, we present a novel visualization that can seamlessly embed temporal displays into a map for occlusion-free visualization of both the spatial and temporal attributes of the data. We first extend the seam carving algorithm to broaden the roads of interest in a map with the least distortion to other areas, and then embed temporal displays into the roads to reveal temporal patterns without the occlusion of map information. We study various design choices in our method, including the encoding of the time direction and temporal display, and conduct two comprehensive user studies to validate our design decisions. We also demonstrate the usability of our approach with case studies on real traffic flow data in a major city. © 2014 IEEE.

84906918615	Face sketch synthesis based on rough drawing	Existing face sketch usually requires well-trained artist to draw natural and realistic images, which hinders its wide usages in digital entertainment and public security management. We present an approach to automatically generate face sketches based on face rough drawing. Firstly, the input face rough drawing is divided into many overlapped patches. Then, the relation of patches between the rough drawing and the sketch is obtained by a coupled dictionary, which is learned from a set of training data using locality-constrained linear coding. Finally, using simulated annealing algorithm, sketches are synthesized from selected candidate sketch patches and optimized by a global energy optimization based on a Markov random field framework. We evaluate our approach on the face sketch XM2VTS database. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84910063242	EvoRiver: Visual analysis of topic coopetition on social media	Cooperation and competition (jointly called 'coopetition') are two modes of interactions among a set of concurrent topics on social media. How do topics cooperate or compete with each other to gain public attention? Which topics tend to cooperate or compete with one another? Who plays the key role in coopetition-related interactions? We answer these intricate questions by proposing a visual analytics system that facilitates the in-depth analysis of topic coopetition on social media. We model the complex interactions among topics as a combination of carry-over, coopetition recruitment, and coopetition distraction effects. This model provides a close functional approximation of the coopetition process by depicting how different groups of influential users (i.e., "topic leaders") affect coopetition. We also design EvoRiver, a time-based visualization, that allows users to explore coopetition-related interactions and to detect dynamically evolving patterns, as well as their major causes. We test our model and demonstrate the usefulness of our system based on two Twitter data sets (social topics data and business topics data).

84920088198	Visual analytics of road traffic with large scale taxi GPS data	With large-scale and complicated spatio-temporal characteristics, visual analytics of taxi GPS data is a challenging issue. In this paper, we present a visual analytic method for road traffic analysis based on taxi GPS data, and we adopt two encoding schemes, the discrete arrow graph and the continuous stack graph, to explore the volume, direction, speed and other information of road traffic flow on widened roads based on OpenStreetMap. Douglas-Peucker algorithm and the velocity clustering algorithm are used for data reduction and improving rendering respectively. The preprocessed taxi GPS data are stored in a cloud computing platform in a distributed manner, and MapReduce is utilized to accelerate data and query processing. We test the validities of our proposed encoding schemes on Hangzhou taxi GPS data. Experimental results show that our method can effectively and accurately reveal the status of road traffic in Hangzhou.

84923146044	Scaling hop-based reachability indexing for fast graph pattern query processing	Graphs are becoming increasingly dominant in modeling real-life networked data including social and biological networks, the WWW and the Semantic Web, etc. Graph pattern queries are useful for gathering information with expressive semantics from these graph-structured data. Current methods for graph pattern query processing have performance deficiency caused by inefficiencies of the underlying reachability index and costly merge-join operations on huge amounts of tuple-formatted intermediate results. To overcome the above problems, this paper contributes in the following aspects to boost graph pattern query evaluation. First, we propose an improved hop-based reachability indexing scheme 3-Hop∗ which gains faster reachability query evaluation, less indexing costs and better scalabilities than state-of-the-art hop-based methods. Second, we propose a two-stage node filtering algorithm based on 3-Hop∗ to answer tree pattern queries more efficiently. Tree pattern queries serve as the underlying facility for graph pattern query evaluation. Furthermore, we use a graph representation of the intermediate results during node filtering and final results enumeration. Experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
