1842486791	Lipid Nano/Submicron Emulsions as Vehicles for Topical Flurbiprofen Delivery	The application of lipid nano/submicron emulsions as topical drug carrier systems for the percutaneous absorption of flurbiprofen was investigated. The lipid emulsions were made up of isopropyl myristate (IPM), soybean oil, or coconut oil as the oil phase, egg lecithin as the predominant emulsifier, and double-distilled water as the external phase. Stearylamine (SA) and deoxycholic acid (DA) also were used to produce positively and negatively charged emulsions. To evaluate the physicochemical properties of the lipid emulsions, particle size by laser light scattering, the image of atomic force microscopy, and relaxation time values by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were determined. The in vitro permeation data showed that incorporation of SA significantly reduced the topical delivery of flurbiprofen. On the other hand, incorporation of DA exhibited no or a negligible effect on drug permeation. Enhancement of drug absorption was observed when adding oleic acid as part of the oil phase. The in vivo topical application of flurbiprofen from selected lipid emulsions showed a similar trend to the in vitro status. Furthermore, the intersubject variability was considerably reduced by lipid emulsions than by aqueous suspensions in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. The irritant profiles of lipid emulsions showed that IPM elicited higher irritation than soybean oil. The incorporation of oleic acid also produced skin disruption. The results in the present study suggest the feasibility of lipid emulsions for the topical delivery of flurbiprofen.

22044453798	Essential oils from sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) as novel enhancers to accelerate transdermal drug delivery	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the essential oils from sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum, OB) as skin permeation enhancers to promote the percutaneous absorption of drugs. The in vitro and in vivo irritancy of the essential oils was also examined. Terpenes with various carbon numbers (mono-, sesqui-, di-, and tri-) were identified in both the lower-polarity fraction (OB-1) and higher-polarity fraction (OB-2). In vitro skin permeation and deposition of indomethacin were significantly enhanced after treatment with OB essential oils. The enhancing effect of OB-1 was greater than that of OB-2 in the in vitro permeation and in vivo cutaneous microdialysis analyses as well as in the plasma concentration of indomethacin. On the other hand, the in vivo study showed that OB-2 had a greater ability to retain the drug within the skin than did OB-1. Enhancement of the skin permeation of drugs by OB essential oils might be mainly due to improvement in the partitioning of the drugs to the stratum corneum. Both in vitro cell cultures (keratinocytes and skin fibroblasts) and in vivo transepidermal water loss showed no or only negligible irritation to skin by OB essential oils. © 2004 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

0031708129	Antiplatelet aggregation principles from Glycosmis citrifolia	Twelve acridone alkaloids, citracridone-I (1), atalaphyllidine (2), noracronycine (3), des-N-methyl-noracronycine (4), 5-hydroxynor-acronycine (5), des-N-methylacronycine (6), N-methyl severifoline (7), 5-hydroxy-N- methyl severifoline (8), glycocitrine-II (9), 3-O-methyl-glycocitrine-II (10), glycocitrine-I (11) and pyranofoline (12); one 2-quinolone alkaloid, 4,8-dimethoxy-1-methyl-3(3-methylbut-2-enyl)2-quinolone (13) were isolated and characterized from the stem and root barks of Glycosmis citrifolia. Their structures were determined by spectral analyses. On bioactive evaluation, compounds 1 and 2 almost completely inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid (100 μM), collagen (10 μg/mL) and PAF (2 ng/mL). Compounds 2, 4 and 13 also showed an inhibitory effect on AA and collagen-induced rabbit platelet aggregation. In the structure and activity relationship of acridone alkaloids, the acridone nucleus bearing a pyranyl moiety is a most important factor for the antiplatelet aggregation activity.

33646424741	Inhibition of superoxide anion and elastase release in human neutrophils by 3′-isopropoxychalcone via a cAMP-dependent pathway	1 Chalcone is abundantly present in the plant kingdom and has various biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. In this study, the semisynthetic chalcone derivative, 3′-isopropoxychalcone (H2O7D), was demonstrated to inhibit the generation of superoxide and the release of elastase, as well as to accelerate resequestration of cytosolic calcium in formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine-activated human neutrophils. 2 H2O7D displayed no antioxidant or superoxide-scavenging ability, and it failed to alter the subcellular NADPH oxidase activity. 3 H2O7D induced a substantial increase in cAMP but not cGMP levels. The elevation of cAMP formation by H2O7D was inhibited by adenosine deaminase (ADA). Furthermore, The inhibitory effects of H2O7D were reversed by protein kinase (PK)A inhibitors, as well as ADA and a selective A2a-receptor antagonist. 4 H2O7D inhibited phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities, but it did not alter adenylyl cyclase and soluble guanylyl cyclase activities. These results show that the cAMP-elevating effect of H2O7D results from the inhibition of PDE activity and not from the stimulation of cyclase function. Consistent with this, H2O7D potentiated the PGE

33747222456	Comparison of transcripts in Phalaenopsis bellina and Phalaenopsis equestris (Orchidaceae) flowers to deduce monoterpene biosynthesis pathway	Background: Floral scent is one of the important strategies for ensuring fertilization and for determining seed or fruit set. Research on plant scents has hampered mainly by the invisibility of this character, its dynamic nature, and complex mixtures of components that are present in very small quantities. Most progress in scent research, as in other areas of plant biology, has come from the use of molecular and biochemical techniques. Although volatile components have been identified in several orchid species, the biosynthetic pathways of orchid flower fragrance are far from understood. We investigated how flower fragrance was generated in certain Phalaenopsis orchids by determining the chemical components of the floral scent, identifying floral expressed-sequence-tags (ESTs), and deducing the pathways of floral scent biosynthesis in Phalaneopsis bellina by bioinformatics analysis. Results: The main chemical components in the P. bellina flower were shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to be monoterpenoids, benzenoids and phenylpropanoids. The set of floral scent producing enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) to geraniol and linalool were recognized through data mining of the P. bellina floral EST database (dbEST). Transcripts preferentially expressed in P. bellina were distinguished by comparing the scent floral dbEST to that of a scentless species, P. equestris, and included those encoding lipoxygenase, epimerase, diacylglycerol kinase and geranyl diphosphate synthase. In addition, EST filtering results showed that transcripts encoding signal transduction and Myb transcription factors and methyltransferase, in addition to those for scent biosynthesis, were detected by in silico hybridization of the P. bellina unigene database against those of the scentless species, rice and Arabidopsis. Altogether, we pinpointed 66% of the biosynthetic steps from G3P to geraniol, linalool and their derivatives. Conclusion: This systems biology program combined chemical analysis, genomics and bioinformatics to elucidate the scent biosynthesis pathway and identify the relevant genes. It integrates the forward and reverse genetic approaches to knowledge discovery by which researchers can study non-model plants. © 2006 Hsiao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

33750717840	Total synthesis and biological evaluation of viscolin, a 1,3-diphenylpropane as a novel potent anti-inflammatory agent	Total synthesis of viscolin, an anti-inflammatory 1,3-diphenylpropane isolated from Viscum coloratum, employing the Wittig reaction is reported. Key steps in the synthesis of viscolin depend on the selection of protecting groups to maintain the para hydroxyl group that is the most critical chemical structure influencing the biological activity of viscolin and the utilization of microwave-assisted Wittig olefination reaction. Anti-inflammatory potency of the synthetic viscolin, its precursor product 16, and its analogue 17, through their effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in leukocytes and microglial cells were evaluated. Excellent inhibition of ROS and NO production in inflammatory cells could confer the synthetic viscolin to be a potent anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of oxidative stress-induced diseases. © 2006.

33846827091	Antiviral effects of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) Against Enterovirus 71	In this study, the antiviral activities of seven different extracts of Salvia miltiorrhiza (danshen) were determined. The first two extracts, SA1 and SA2, isolated at room temperature by ethyl acetate and water extraction, respectively, neutralized the enterovirus 71-induced cytopathic effect in Vero, rhabdomyosarcoma and MRC-5 cells. The other five crude extracts, extracted with warm water (60-70°C) or organic solvents, did not have any protective activity. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for neutralizing the enterovirus 71-induced cytopathic effect were 0.742 ± 0.042 mg/ml for SA1 and 0.585 ± 0.018 mg/ml for SA2 in Vero cells. No antiviral activity was observed in the other viruses tested. Antiviral activity was more efficient in cultures treated with SA1 or SA2 during viral infection compared to the cultures treated before or after infection, suggesting that these danshen extracts could interfere with viral entry. SA1 and SA2 were able to inhibit viral RNA synthesis in the infected cells and to abate the apoptotic process in enterovirus 71-infected Vero cells. We conclude that danshen extracts possess antiviral activity and have potential for the development as an anti-enterovirus 71 agent.

39849111046	Temperature-sensitive hydrogels composed of chitosan and hyaluronic acid as injectable carriers for drug delivery	Temperature-sensitive hydrogels composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) with chitosan (CPN) and chitosan + hyaluronic acid (CPNHA) were grafted in order to examine their physicochemical characteristics, in vitro drug release, and in vivo pharmacodynamics. The sol-gel transition behavior was investigated by UV/visible spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry, and viscometry. A slight difference in the transition temperatures was observed among these polymer systems, with CPN and CPNHA exhibiting higher temperatures compared with PNIPAAm. A zeta potential determination revealed a positive charge for the CPN hydrogel, whereas no or only a negligible charge was observed for PNIPAAm and CPNHA. The entanglement of CPN hydrogels observed using scanning electronic microscopy showed the densest cross-linkage structure, followed by CPNHA and PNIPAAm. Both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, including nalbuphine, indomethacin, and the nalbuphine prodrug, were used as model drugs in an in vitro drug release experiment. All 3 hydrogels significantly prolonged drug release. The release rate of hydrophilic nalbuphine increased in the order CPN < CPNHA < PNIPAAm. The drug release of these hydrogels exhibited a trend opposite to that of lipophilic drugs. A cold ethanol tail-flick study was utilized in order to examine the antinociceptive activity of intravenous nalbuphine. CPN and CPNHA prolonged the analgesic duration of nalbuphine with no influence on the onset time. The loading of nalbuphine in the CPNHA hydrogel exhibited the longest analgesic duration (4 h) among the 3 hydrogels tested. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

32044438265	Characterization and evaluation of silk protein hydrogels for drug delivery	The objective of this study was to characterize and evaluate the physicochemical properties and drug release profiles of hydrogels composed of silk protein (SP) polymers. SPs with a low MW (SPL, ca. 18 kDa) and a high MW (SPH, ca. 76 kDa) were used for preparing hydrogels. Both the random coil form and β-sheet conformation simultaneously existed in the hydrogels according to Fourier-transformed IR determination. Morphologically, the hydrogels showed a sponge-like cross-linked structure produced by physical entanglement as well as chemical hydrogen and covalent bindings. The in vitro buprenorphine delivery from SPH hydrogels showed a slow-release effect, and a zero-order rate was obtained for all preparations. Drug release could be controlled by varying the SPH concentrations or incorporation of SPL into the systems. SP hydrogels showed a stronger barrier property for hydrophilic solutes than for hydrophobic solutes. The incorporation of SPH into Pluronic F-127 (PF-127) hydrogels changed the gel structure from amorphous micelles to a regularly interconnected texture with pores. Furthermore, SPH as an adjuvant polymer in PF-127 and chitosan hydrogels lowered and controlled the amount of drug released from those systems. © 2006 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

80052264762	Viscolin reduces VCAM-1 expression in TNF-α-treated endothelial cells via the JNK/NF-κB and ROS pathway	Viscolin, a major active component in a chloroform extract of Viscum coloratum, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. We focused on its effects on the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The TNF-α-induced expression of VCAM-1 was significantly reduced by respectively 38 ± 7 or 34 ± 16% when HUVECs were pretreated with 10 or 30 μM viscolin, as shown by Western blotting, and was also significantly reduced by pretreatment with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine, diphenylene iodonium chloride, and apocynin. Viscolin also reduced TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 mRNA expression and promoter activity, decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, and significantly reduced the binding of monocytes to TNF-α-stimulated HUVECs. The attenuation of TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression and cell adhesion was partly mediated by a decrease in JNK phosphorylation. Furthermore, viscolin reduced VCAM-1 expression in the aorta of TNF-α-treated mice in vivo. Taken together, these data show that viscolin inhibits TNF-α-induced JNK phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65, and ROS generation and thereby suppresses VCAM-1 expression, resulting in reduced adhesion of leukocytes. These results also suggest that viscolin may prevent the development of atherosclerosis and inflammatory responses. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

80052314949	A novel testosterone catabolic pathway in bacteria	The oxic testosterone catabolic pathway involves several oxygen-dependent reactions and is not available for anaerobes. Since then, a variety of anaerobic bacteria have been described for the ability to degrade testosterone in the absence of oxygen. Here, a novel, oxygenase-independent testosterone catabolic pathway in such organisms is described. Steroidobacter denitrificans DSMZ18526 was shown to be capable of degrading testosterone in the absence of oxygen and was selected as the model organism in this study. In a previous investigation, we identified the initial intermediates involved in an anoxic testosterone catabolic pathway, most of which are identical to those of the oxic pathway demonstrated in Comamonas testosteroni. In this study, five additional intermediates of the anoxic pathway were identified. We demonstrated that subsequent steps of the anoxic pathway greatly differ from those of the established oxic pathway, which suggests that a novel pathway for testosterone catabolism is present. In the proposed anoxic pathway, a reduction reaction occurs at C-4 and C-5 of androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, the last common intermediate of both the oxic and anoxic pathways. After that, a novel hydration reaction occurs and a hydroxyl group is thus introduced to the C-1α position of C

84876788369	Anaerobic and aerobic cleavage of the steroid core ring structure by Steroidobacter denitrifi cans	The aerobic degradation of steroids by bacteria has been studied in some detail. In contrast, only little is known about the anaerobic steroid catabolism. Steroidobacter denitrifi cans can utilize testosterone under both oxic and anoxic conditions. By conducting metabolomic investigations, we demonstrated that S. denitrifi cans adopts the 9,10- seco-pathway to degrade testosterone under oxic conditions. This pathway depends on the use of oxygenases for oxygenolytic ring fi ssion. Conversely, the detected degradation intermediates under anoxic conditions suggest a novel, oxygenase- independent testosterone catabolic pathway, the 2,3- seco-pathway, which differs signifi cantly from the aerobic route. In this anaerobic pathway, testosterone is fi rst transformed to 1-dehydrotestosterone, which is then reduced to produce 1-testosterone followed by water addition to the C-1/C-2 double bond of 1-testosterone. Subsequently, the C-1 hydroxyl group is oxidized to produce 17-hydroxy-androstan- 1,3-dione. The A-ring of this compound is cleaved by hydrolysis as evidenced by H 2 18 O-incorporation experiments. Regardless of the growth conditions, testosterone is initially transformed to 1-dehydrotestosterone. This intermediate is a divergence point at which the downstream degradation pathway is governed by oxygen availability. Our results shed light into the previously unknown cleavage of the sterane ring structure without oxygen. We show that, under anoxic conditions, the microbial cleavage of steroidal core ring system begins at the A-ring.

43049092696	The delivery of platinum drugs from thermosensitive hydrogels containing different ratios of chitosan	New thermosensitive hydrogels of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) with chitosan (CPN) were prepared and evaluated for use in the delivery of the platinum drugs, cisplatin and carboplatin. The effects of polymers containing different ratios of chitosan on the physicochemical and drug release characteristics were examined. The sol-gel transition temperature of the hydrogels was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and viscometry. Discrepancies in the transition temperature among the various polymer systems were more pronounced when determined by viscosity compared by DSC, with the CPN showing a higher transition temperature than PNIPAAm. The cross-sectional structure and surface topography of the hydrogels were examined by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. The incorporation of chitosan further increased the entanglement of the hydrogel network. An increase in the chitosan ratio in the polymers (CPN-H) also increased the cross-linking structure. A smoother surface of hydrogel matrices was observed for CPN compared with PNIPAAm. All hydrogels tested significantly reduced drug release compared with an aqueous solution. The release rate of platinum drugs from PNIPAAm was retarded at the late stage. CPN matrices could continuously deliver platinum drugs during the experiment. The rate of release from CPN-H was generally slower than that from hydrogels and had a lower chitosan ratio (CPN-L), presumably due to the more-tortuous pathways in the hydrogels. Thermosensitive hydrogels like those prepared in this study may be a promising carrier for the delivery of platinum drugs, as the drug release can be controlled and sustained using CPN networks.

These bioactive compounds were examined for their antityrosinase potency. No antityrosinase activity was detected with treatment using stilbenes. On the other hand, the anthraquinones showed moderate to strong inhibition of tyrosinase. Physcion exhibited the most potent tyrosinase inhibition among the four anthraquinones examined, which was comparable to kojic acid. The ability of anthraquinones to permeate the skin was also examined. Based on the same thermodynamic activity, physcion showed a higher permeation compared with emodin (48-fold), suggesting it as a potent candidate for dermal use. As naturally occurring tyrosinase inhibitors, anthraquinones from P. cuspidatum may be useful as skin-whitening agents to inhibit tyrosinase for dermal use. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) was grafted to PF127 to form a new hydrogel matrix (HP) for delivery of cisplatin and carboplatin. The physicochemical properties and drug delivery of the graft were examined in this study. HP system (20% HP copolymer in water) exhibited a similar sol-gel transition temperature (28.3°C) as PF127 system (20% PF127 copolymer in water) but with a shorter gelling process. A stronger structure was obtained by HP system according to scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and viscosity kinetics. In vitro release test showed the sustained-release characteristics of hydrogels entrapped with cisplatin and carboplatin. The drug release rate from HP hydrogel was slower than that from PF127 hydrogel. The reduction of drug release by HP system as compared to the control solution was more significant for cisplatin than for carboplatin. Such a thermosensitive hydrogel may be advantageous as an injectable therapeutic formulation for anticancer treatment. © 2009 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

The physicochemical properties such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), polarity and sol-gel transition temperature, as well as in vitro drug release of developed hydrogels were examined. The sol-gel temperature of PF, PF with liposomes and AP was 26.4, 19.7 and 26.6°C, respectively. A hydrogel with stronger strength was obtained by alginate coupling (AP) according to SEM images and viscosity kinetics as compared to PF. Both liposomes and hydrogels could sustain the release of cisplatin to a certain level. The drug release from the vehicles decreased in the order of PF > liposomes ≫ AP ≫ PF/liposomes > AP/liposomes. The burst release effect of cisplatin was inhibited when using the AP/liposomes composite system as the vehicle. Formulations were administered intratumorally in melanoma-bearing mice. The respective liposomes or hydrogels did not increase cisplatin accumulation in melanomas compared to the control (aqueous solution). PF/liposomes and AP/liposomes, respectively, increased cisplatin deposition by 2.5- and 4.4-fold. To our best of knowledge, the present work is the first report to investigate the drug delivery from PF-alginate conjugates. © 2009 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

67349091433	Extract isolated from Angelica hirsutiflora with insulin secretagogue activity	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Angelica genus (Umbelliferae) has traditionally been used as the medicine and health food considered alleviating several disorders including diabetes mellitus. Angelica hirsutiflora Liu Chao & Chuang is an endemic species and a folk medicine in Taiwan. Aim of the study: The scientific evidence of anti-diabetic effect for Angelica hirsutiflora remains unknown. The methanolic extracts isolated from Angelica hirsutiflora were studied for its insulin secretagogue and hypoglycemic activities. Materials and methods: The in vitro effects and possible mechanisms of Angelica hirsutiflora extract on the insulin secretion in isolated mouse and human islets and pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15 were determined; and tested the regulation of blood glucose in fasted mice and high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice. Results: Angelica hirsutiflora extract potently stimulated the release of insulin from cultured HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse and human islets. The intracellular calcium levels were also increased in HIT-T15 cells and isolated human islets treated with Angelica hirsutiflora extract. Angelica hirsutiflora extract was capable of enhancing the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 protein in HIT-T15 cells. Specific ERK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited the increase of insulin secretion by Angelica hirsutiflora extract in HIT-T15 cells and isolated mouse islets. When Angelica hirsutiflora extract was administered to the fasted mice, it decreased the rise in blood glucose level after starch loading. The plasma insulin level was also increased by Angelica hirsutiflora extract treatment. In high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice, Angelica hirsutiflora extract markedly improved the oral glucose intolerance as compared with the vehicle control. Conclusions: These findings support that Angelica hirsutiflora extract may be useful in the control of hyperglycemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus by acting as an insulin secretagogue. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

67650667411	Proteomic screening of antioxidant effects exhibited by Radix Salvia miltiorrhiza aqueous extract in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells under homocysteine treatment	Aim of the study: Still little is known about the cellular mechanisms that contribute to the attenuated proliferation of aortic smooth muscle cells under the influence of the oxidative stress factors such as homocysteine (Hcy). Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae), a Chinese medicinal herb widely used in folk medicine for therapy of variety of human cardiovascular disorders would modulate this Hcy promoted growth effect in model animal aortic cells system. Materials and methods: The Salvia miltiorrhiza roots aqueous extract (SMAE) containing 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid and salvianolic acid B, as confirmed by narrow-bore HPLC analyses with binary gradient elution was used in variable concentrations for the treatment of the rat aortic smooth muscle A10 cells under Hcy stimulation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was applied for the elucidation of protein changes characterizing the response of the rat A10 cells into the Hcy-induced oxidative stress. Results: This study showed that a low dose (0.015 mg/mL) of the SMAE significantly inhibited growth (>60%, p < 0.05) of the Hcy stimulated rat A10 cells. In addition, concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) obviously decreased in the rat A10 cells after its incubation with SMAE in terms of catalase increasing activity. Next, marked down-regulation of protein kinase C beta-1 (PKC beta-1) and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-MAPK) expression suggest that observed inhibitory effect of the polyphenol-rich SMAE on the Hcy-induced growth of rat A10 cells was realized via the PKC/p44/42 MAPK-dependent pathway. The intensity changes of 10 protein spots in response of the rat A10 cells to the Hcy-induced oxidative damage as alpha-4-tropomyosin, vimentin, F1F0-ATP synthase (beta subunit), glucose regulated protein 75 (GRP75), actin (fragment), prohibitin, capping protein, plakoglobin, endoplasmic reticulum protein (ERp29), and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIase A), were detected with statistical significance (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, it was showed that used here SMAE resist carbonylation of specific cytoskeleton and chaperone proteins as vimentin, alpha-4-tropomyosin and GRP75, respectively, leading to phenotype transformations in the rat A10 cells. Conclusion: These data suggest that applied here SMAE exerts its protective effect through circulating ROS suppression and subsequent modulation of protein carbonylation in rat aortic smooth muscle A10 cells. Redox-proteomics protocol highlighted in this study may be applicable in facilitating the assessing potential novel molecular therapeutic targets to reduce cardiovascular risk related with elevated Hcy levels in various human populations and elucidating new mechanisms through which protein functions can be regulated by the redox status with the use of naturally occurring antioxidants. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

67650883136	Antiviral effect of epigallocatechin gallate on enterovirus 71	Oxidative stress is known to be a determinant of a host's susceptibility to pathogens. Natural compounds with antioxidant activity may provide a preventive measure against infection. Tea polyphenols were evaluated for their ability to inhibit enterovirus 71 (EV71) replication in Vero cell culture. Among the polyphenols compounds tested, epigallocatechin gállate (EGCG) and gallocatechin gállate (GCG) potently inhibited replication of EV71. EGCG and GCG reduced the titer of infectious progeny virus by 95%. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis also revealed that EGCG suppressed replication of genomic RNA. It was accompanied by an increased cytoprotective effect. EGCG and GCG caused 5-fold increase in the viability of EV71-infected cells. The viral inhibitory effect correlated well with the antioxidant capacity of polyphenol. Mechanistically, EV71 infection led to increased oxidative stress, as shown by increased dichlorofluorescein and MitoSOX Red fluorescence. Upon EGCG treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was significantly reduced. Consistent with this, EV71 replication was enhanced in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient cells, and such enhancement was largely reversed by EGCG. These findings suggest that EGCG may suppress viral replication via modulation of cellular redox milieu. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

Six anthraquinones, of which four have been identified for the first time from Trichoderma and two have already been reported in other strains, were purified from Trichoderma harzianum strain Th-R16 to evaluate their biological activities. The structures of the compounds were determined by one- and two-dimensional NMR. The compounds were shown to exhibit stronger antifungal activity than antibacterial activity. Low yield compounds, like 1,5-dihydroxy-3-hydroxymethyl-9,10-anthraquinone, were found to be more active against fungal pathogens than pachybasin and crysophanol, which were found to be the major extracellular metabolites. Test anthraquinones with higher oxidation numbers had better antifungal activity, and their activities were concentration-dependent. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The standard deviations of the migration time of the three flavonoids were determined to be 0.64%, 0.83%, and 1.17%, and peak areas were 6.14%, 7.57%, and 8.33%. Recoveries ranged between 90.37 and 109.4%. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

77949839779	Differences in pharmacokinetics and ex vivo antioxidant activity following intravenous and oral administrations of emodin to rats	Emodin, a natural anthraquinone polyphenol, has been reported to possess promising in vitro antioxidation, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. Whether the in vitro bioactivities can predict in vivo effects remained an unanswered question without understanding emodin pharmacokinetics in animals. To fill this blank, this study investigated the biological fate of emodin in rats. Emodin was intravenously (5.0 mg/kg) and orally (20.0 and 40.0 mg/kg) administered to rats. Blood samples were assayed by HPLC before and after hydrolysis with sulfatase and β-glucuronidase. It is observed that after intravenous bolus of emodin, the parent form of emodin declined rapidly, and emodin glucuronides, ω-hydroxyemodin (ω-OHE) and ω-OHE sulfates/ glucuronides all emerged instantaneously. In contrast, when emodin was given orally, emodin glucuronides were exclusively present in serum, whereas emodin, ω-OHE and ω-OHE sulfates/glucuronides were not detected. In order to evaluate the in vivo antioxidation activity, the serum metabolites of emodin following intravenous and oral administrations were prepared from rats and characterized, followed by investigating the effects on 2,2′-azobis(2- amidinopropane hydrochloride)-induced hemolysis. The results suggested that the serum metabolites of oral emodin exhibited more promising free radical scavenging activity than those of intravenous emodin and emodin parent form. We suggest biologists to redirect their targets to emodin glucuronide. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

77957362149	Scutellariae radix suppresses hepatitis B virus production in human hepatoma cells	The traditional Chinese medicine Xiao-Chai-Hu-Tang (HD-7) has been widely used to treat liver diseases in China and Japan. HD-7 consists of seven different ingredients, but which one provides the therapeutic benefits is still unknown. Here, we identified the "Minister herb" Scutellariae radix (HD-1S), but not the "King herb" Bupleuri radix (HD-1B) in HD-7, as the active component that suppresses HBV gene expression and virus production in human hepatoma cells. We have found that an aqueous extract of HD-1S not only suppressed wild-type virus but also lamivudine-resistant HBV mutant in human hepatoma cells. We show that HD-1S selectively suppresses HBV core promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis has revealed that HD-1S treatment decreases the DNA-binding activity of nuclear extract of HepA2 cells to a specific cis-element of the HBV core promoter, which includes the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor binding site and HNF4. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PGC-1 abolished the suppression of HD-1S on HBV core promoter activity suggesting that HD-1S may act through modulating hepatic transcriptional machinery to suppress HBV viral gene expression and virus production.

78650566926	Thermosensitive hydrogels composed of hyaluronic acid and gelatin as carriers for the intravesical administration of cisplatin	The aim of this work was to evaluate the use of thermosensitive hydrogels for intravesical cisplatin delivery into the bladder. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) was grafted onto hyaluronic acid (HA) to synthesize an HPN copolymer, which was further grafted with gelatin to form an HPNG copolymer. A 3% concentration of HPN and HPNG was sufficient to exert a thermosensitive response, whereas a concentration of 8% was needed for PNIPAM to form the hydrogel. The physicochemical and drug delivery properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), hydration ratio, and in vitro cisplatin release. The incorporation of HA and gelatin produced a different microstructure compared to the parent PNIPAM hydrogel. Gelatin conjugation increased the fibrous structure in the matrix. The LCSTs of PNIPAM, HPN, and HPNG were 32.3, 32.0, and 30.7°C, respectively. The copolymers showed an eightfold increase in the hydration capacity compared to PNIPAM, with no significant difference in values between HPN and HPNG. The release of cisplatin from an aqueous solution (control) was nearly complete after 8 h, compared to 85, 80, and 52% release from PNIPAM, HPN, and HPNG, respectively. In vivo evaluation of cisplatin levels in bladder tissues was performed following intravesical instillation in rats. When the dwell time was extended to 6 h, PNIPAM showed a sevenfold enhancement in the drug concentration in the bladder wall. HPNG also showed a twofold increase in the drug concentration. The administration of cisplatin by the HPN carrier did not change the drug accumulation compared to the control. Confocal laser scanning microscopic results confirmed the trend of drug absorption from various systems. A histological examination showed no adverse change in the urothelium with HPN or HPNG application. PNIPAM caused partial desquamation of umbrella cells. The thermosensitive hydrogels prepared in this study may be promising carriers for targeted drug delivery to the bladder. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79952461742	PBA-ω-Lys as sustained phenylbutyrate-releasing prodrug	Lysine was attached to phenylbutyric acid (PBA) to form PBA-α-Lys and PBA-ω-Lys as PBA prodrugs for treating chemotherapy-associated mucositis. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in Wistar rats for determining the systemic bioavailability of both prodrugs and the released PBA. The systemic bioavailability of PBA after oral administration of PBA-α-Lys or PBA-ω-Lys was higher than from i.v. administration, indicating that first pass effect is responsible for the transformation from the prodrugs to the parent drug. Lack of stability in the intestine made PBA-α-Lys unsatisfied as an oral prodrug of PBA. Oral administration of PBA-ω-Lys, on the other hand, led to a slow PBA-releasing profile in circulation.

0035984942	In vitro topical application and in vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation of nonivamide hydrogels using Wistar rat as an animal model	Nonivamide, a so-called synthetic capsaicin, is a substitute for capsaicin which has a similar chemical structure and pharmacological activities as those of capsaicin. The purposes of this study were to explore the in vivo pharmacodynamic responses of nonivamide in hydrogels using Wistar rat as an animal model and to correlate the in vivo results with in vitro topical application. The incorporation of Pluronic F-127 polymer into hydrogels resulted in retarded release of nonivamide. Chitosan and carboxymethylcellulose hydrogels produced higher levels of in vitro nonivamide permeation and skin distribution. The in vivo effects of nonivamide on skin perturbation and vasodilation were found to differ depending on dose and duration after topical application. Quantification of transepidermal water loss was demonstrated to correlate with the measured in vitro skin distribution of nonivamide. The various doses of nonivamide in the hydrogels did not markedly influence erythematous reactions of skin as determined by colorimetric measurements. Hydrogel formulations of nonivamide delivered more drug to the skin and produced greater pharmacodynamic activities than did cream bases of capsaicin. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

79957500545	Partially purified extract and viscolin from Viscum coloratum attenuate airway inflammation and eosinophil infiltration in ovalbumin-sensitized mice	Aim of the study: Viscum coloratum Nakai is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various diseases, including hemorrhage, hypertension, and inflammatory diseases. A previous study demonstrated a partially purified extract (PPE-SVC) and viscolin from Viscum coloratum Nakai inhibited phosphodiesterase activity. In this study, we evaluated the anti-asthmatic effects of PPE-SVC and viscolin, from Viscum coloratum Nakai, in OVA-sensitized mice. Materials and methods: Female BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). The mice were randomized into groups and treated with PPE-SVC, viscolin, or rolipram by intraperitoneal injection on 1 h before each inhalation of OVA and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). Results: PPE-SVC and viscolin suppressed AHR and reduced eosinophil infiltration of the lungs in OVA-sensitized mice. Moreover, PPE-SVC and viscolin inhibited chemokines, including CCL11 and CCL24, and Th2-associated cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. However, PPE-SVC and viscolin could not decrease IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels in cultures of OVA-activated spleen cells. Conclusion: PPE-SVC and viscolin attenuate airway inflammation and eosinophil infiltration in OVA-sensitized mice. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

79960162474	Transdermal delivery of selegiline from alginate-Pluronic composite thermogels	The present work was carried out to design a practical, controlled-release transdermal system for selegiline using thermosensitive hydrogels. The copolymers of alginate and Pluronic F127 (PF127) were used to design thermogels by either physical blending (A + P) or chemical grafting (AP). The thermogels were characterized in terms of the sol-gel temperature, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), degradation ratio, and skin permeation behavior. The chemical grafting of alginate to PF127 could delay the sol-gel temperature from 24.1 to 30.4 °C, which is near the temperature of the skin surface. The gelling temperature of the physical mixture of alginate and PF127 (A + P) did not significantly differ. The porosity of the A + P structure was greater compared to that of the AP structure. AP thermogels were regularly degraded, with 60% of the gel matrix remaining after a 48-h incubation. PF127 and A + P hydrogels showed almost no degradation. The results of skin permeation across porcine skin and nude mouse skin suggested that the thermogels could produce sustained selegiline release, with AP showing the most-sustained permeation. AP hydrogels exhibited linear permeation properties for the transdermal delivery of selegiline. Inter-subject variations in skin permeation were reduced by incorporation of the thermogel. Such a thermosensitive hydrogel can be advantageous as a topical therapeutic formulation for selegiline. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84355162076	Treatment of psoriatic nails with indigo naturalis oil extract: A non-controlled pilot study	Background: In the treatment of nail psoriasis, standardized therapeutic regimens are currently lacking. Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of indigo naturalis oil extract in patients with nail psoriasis. Methods: Patients with nail psoriasis applied indigo naturalis oil extract on affected nails twice daily for 24 weeks. Efficacy was evaluated using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) and modified target NAPSI for the single most severely affected nail. Results: Twenty-eight out of 32 patients completed the study. The mean NAPSI was 36.1 ± 14.7 at baseline and decreased to 14.9 ± 11.1 at week 24 while the mean modified target NAPSI was 11.7 ± 3.9 at baseline and decreased to 3.6 ± 3.2 at week 24. Conclusions: Indigo naturalis oil extract appeared to improve nail psoriasis. Although preliminary, these results indicate that it could provide a novel therapeutic option for nail psoriasis, a disease notoriously difficult to treat. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84863992905	Physalin F induces cell apoptosis in human renal carcinoma cells by targeting NF-kappaB and generating reactive oxygen species	Background: The aim of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms of physalin F, an effective purified extract of Physalis angulata L. (Solanacae), in renal carcinoma A498 cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: Physalin F was observed to significantly induce cytotoxicity of three human renal carcinoma A498, ACHN, and UO-31 cells in a concentration-dependent manner; this was especially potent in A498 cells. The physalin F-induced cell apoptosis of A498 cells was characterized by MTT assay, nuclear DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Using flow cytometry analysis, physalin F induced A498 cell apoptosis as demonstrated by the accumulation of the sub-G1 phase in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, physalin F-mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL degradation, which led to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. These effects were associated with induction of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity, which led to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. However, the antioxidant N-acetyl-

84865855192	Kalanchoe tubiflora extract inhibits cell proliferation by affecting the mitotic apparatus	Background: Kalanchoe tubiflora (KT) is a succulent plant native to Madagascar, and is commonly used as a medicinal agent in Southern Brazil. The underlying mechanisms of tumor suppression are largely unexplored.Methods: Cell viability and wound-healing were analyzed by MTT assay and scratch assay respectively. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed by FACS. Mitotic defects were analyzed by indirect immunofluoresence images.Results: An n-Butanol-soluble fraction of KT (KT-NB) was able to inhibit cell proliferation. After a 48 h treatment with 6.75 μg/ml of KT, the cell viability was less than 50% of controls, and was further reduced to less than 10% at higher concentrations. KT-NB also induced an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle as well as an increased level of cells in the subG1 phase. Instead of disrupting the microtubule network of interphase cells, KT-NB reduced cell viability by inducing multipolar spindles and defects in chromosome alignment. KT-NB inhibits cell proliferation and reduces cell viability by two mechanisms that are exclusively involved with cell division: first by inducing multipolarity; second by disrupting chromosome alignment during metaphase.Conclusion: KT-NB reduced cell viability by exclusively affecting formation of the proper structure of the mitotic apparatus. This is the main idea of the new generation of anti-mitotic agents. All together, KT-NB has sufficient potential to warrant further investigation as a potential new anticancer agent candidate. © 2012 Hsieh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0037448407	Effect of enhancers and retarders on percutaneous absorption of flurbiprofen from hydrogels	The effect of enhancers/retarders on the transdermal absorption of flurbiprofen from cellulose hydrogels was studied in vitro. The release rate of flurbiprofen and the viscosity of hydrogel matrices were also examined. The flux of flurbiprofen from cellulose hydrogels approximated that from aqueous buffers, whereas the skin reservoir of flurbiprofen was lower with hydrogels. Incorporation of the cosolvents, propylene glycol (PG) and ethanol, did not significantly increase skin absorption of flurbiprofen. Ethanol even reduced the skin reservoir of the drug. Oleic acid, an unsaturated fatty acid, produced the largest skin reservoir of the drug when incorporated into the hydrogels. D-Limonene, a cyclic monoterpene, showed the greatest ability to enhance the flux of flurbiprofen. However, phospholipids as retarders markedly reduced the skin absorption of flurbiprofen. The mechanisms by which enhancers/retarders govern flurbiprofen permeation were elucidated by in vitro permeation studies using various skin types (enhancers/retarders-pretreated skin, stratum corneum (SC)-stripped skin, and delipidized skin) and histological examination. The results suggest different mechanisms and skin structural modifications caused by different enhancers/retarders. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84872145215	Indigo naturalis upregulates claudin-1 expression in human keratinocytes and psoriatic lesions	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Indigo naturalis is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various dermatoses. Our previous clinical studies showed that indigo naturalis is an effective treatment for psoriasis. Herein, the capabilities of indigo naturalis extract and its derivatives to increase claudin-1 expression and tight junction (TJ) function in human keratinocytes and psoriatic lesions were further studied. Materials and methods: Claudin-1 expression in psoriatic plaques with or without indigo naturalis treatment was analyzed by immunohistochemical methods. In primary human keratinocytes, the expression of claudin-1 was analyzed by fluorescent immunostaining, a real-time RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis. The effect of indigo naturalis on TJs was evaluated by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and paracellular tracer flux. Results: The indigo naturalis extract upregulated mRNA and protein expressions of claudin-1 and function of TJs in primary human keratinocytes in concentration-dependent manners. Its main components, indirubin, indigo, and tryptanthrin, exerted synergistic effects on upregulating TJ functions in primary human keratinocytes. In addition, indigo naturalis increased the activity of protein kinase C (PKC), and a known potent PKC inhibitor, Ro318220, attenuated the indigo naturalis-induced claudin-1 expression. Significantly, restoration of claudin-1 was observed in healed psoriatic lesions after indigo naturalis treatment. Conclusions: Indigo naturalis upregulates claudin-1 expression and restores TJ function in keratinocytes. Our data also suggest that indirubin, indigo, and tryptanthrin have a synergistic effect on TJ function. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84873449012	Squalene-containing nanostructured lipid carriers promote percutaneous absorption and hair follicle targeting of diphencyprone for treating alopecia areata	Purpose: Diphencyprone (DPCP) is a therapeutic agent for treating alopecia areata. To improve skin absorption and follicular targeting nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were developed. Methods: Nanoparticles were characterized by size, zeta potential, molecular environment, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). In vitro and in vivo skin absorption experiments were performed. Fluorescence and confocal microscopes for imaging skin distribution were used. Results: NLCs with different designs were 208 ~ 265 nm with > 77% DPCP encapsulation. NLCs incorporating a cationic surfactant or more soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) showed higher lipophilicity compared to typical NLCs by Nile red emission. All NLCs tested revealed controlled DPCP release; burst release was observed for control. The formulation with more SPC provided 275 μg/g DPCP skin retention, which was greater than control and other NLCs. Intersubject deviation was reduced after DPCP loading into NLCs. Cyanoacrylate skin biopsy demonstrated greater follicular deposition for NLCs with more SPC compared to control. Cationic NLCs but not typical or SPC-containing carriers were largely internalized into keratinocytes. In vivo skin retention of NLCs with more SPC was higher than free control. Confocal imaging confirmed localization of NLCs in follicles and intercellular lipids of stratum corneum. Conclusions: This work encourages further investigation of DPCP absorption using NLCs with a specific formulation design. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84874624119	Euphorbia formosana root extract induces apoptosis by caspase-dependent cell death via fas and mitochondrial pathway in THP-1 human leukemic cells	Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a very rare type of cancer, generally affects patients over 50 years old. While clinical drugs to treat advanced stages of AML exist, the disease becomes increasingly resistant to therapies. Euphorbia formosana Hayata (EF) is a native Taiwanese medicinal plant used to treat rheumatism, liver cirrhosis, herpes zoster, scabies, and photoaging, along with tumor suppression. However, the mechanisms by which it suppresses tumors have not been explored. Here, we provide molecular evidence that a hot-water extract of Euphorbia formosana (EFW) selectively inhibited the growth of human leukemic cancer cells more than other solid human cancer cell lines. Most importantly, the plant extract had limited toxicity toward healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After THP-1 leukemic cells were treated with 50-100 μg/mL EFW for one day, the S phase DNA content of the cells increased, while treatment with 200-400 μg/mL caused the cells to accumulate in the G0/G1 phase. Notably, EFW did not affect A-549 lung cancer cells. The effectiveness of EFW against THP-1 cells may be through caspase-dependent apoptosis in leukemic cells, which is mediated through the Fas and mitochondrial pathways. The potent antileukemic activity of EFW in vitro warrants further investigation of this plant to treat leukemias and other malignancies. © 2013 by the authors.

84881259916	Functional proteomics reveals the protective effects of saffron ethanolic extract on hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury	Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a common clinical problem and ROS may be a contributing factor on IR injury. The current study evaluates the potential protective effect of saffron ethanol extract (SEE) in a rat model upon hepatic IR injury. Caspases 3 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) results showed increased cell death in the IR samples; reversely, minor apoptosis was detected in the SEE/IR group. Pretreatment with SEE significantly restored the content of antioxidant enzymes (SOD1 and catalase) and remarkably inhibited the intracellular ROS concentration in terms of reducing p47phox translocation. Proteome tools revealed that 20 proteins were significantly modulated in protein intensity between IR and SEE/IR groups. Particularly, SEE administration could attenuate the carbonylation level of several chaperone proteins. Network analysis suggested that saffron extract could alleviate IR-induced ER stress and protein ubiquitination, which finally lead to cell apoptosis. Taken together, SEE could reduce hepatic IR injury through modulating protein oxidation and our results might help to develop novel therapeutic strategies against ROS-caused diseases. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84884824505	Cancer and Treatment with Seeds of Chinese Fan Palm (Livistona chinensis R: Brown)	This chapter reviews various studies and discusses the most recent progress in the possible underlying mechanisms through which the active components in Livistona chinensis (LC) extracts can exert their anti-tumor activity. The seeds of LC have long been documented in several Chinese medical books as being a useful herb for treating various cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), esophageal cancer, and leukemia. In addition to the antiproliferative activity against tumor cells, results from some recent studies also indicate the anti-angiogenic potential of the LC extract. The water and ethanolic extracts of the seeds of LC possess antitumor, anti-angiogenic, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity. The ethanolic extracts of the seeds of LC contain protein kinase inhibitory activity, which is well co-purified with antitumor activity in various chromatography steps. However, it is unclear whether the protein kinase inhibitory activity in LC extracts contributes to the antitumor property of this herb. Blockage of the functions of EGFR and intracellular kinase activities may account for the antitumor activity of the active components in LC-X. More recently, several studies have reported various biological activities of phenolic compounds extracted from the seeds of LC, including hemolytic activity, antibacterial and membrane-damaging activity, and cell protective activity against H

Permeation of indomethacin was significantly enhanced after treatment with AO-1 and AO-2 in the in vitro and in vivo studies. AO-2 generally showed a higher ability to promote drug permeation compared to AO-1. The increment of skin/vehicle partitioning may be the predominant mechanism for this enhancing activity. Both transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and colorimetric evaluation showed limited irritation to skin by AO essential oils at the macroscopic level. Human skin fibroblasts were used to investigate the in vitro screening of skin toxicity. AO-1 slightly increased prostaglandin E

84888623112	An in vitro study of the antimicrobial effects of indigo naturalis prepared from strobilanthes formosanus moore	Indigo naturalis is effective in treating nail psoriasis coexisting with microorganism infections. This study examines the antimicrobial effects of indigo naturalis prepared from Strobilanthes formosanus Moore. Eight bacterial and seven fungal strains were assayed using the agar diffusion method to examine the effects of indigo naturalis and its bioactive compounds. The bioactive compounds of indigo naturalis were purified sequentially using GFC, TLC, and HPLC. Their structures were identified using mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. UPLC-MS/MS was applied to compare the metabolome profiles of indigo naturalis ethyl-acetate (EA) extract and its source plant, Strobilanthes formosanus Moore. The results of in vitro antimicrobial assays showed that indigo naturalis EA-extract significantly (≥1 mg/disc) inhibits Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)) and mildly inhibits non-dermatophytic onychomycosis pathogens (Aspergillus fumigates and Candida albicans), but has little effect on dermatophyes. Isatin and tryptanthrin were identified as the bioactive compounds of indigo naturalis using S. aureus and S. epidermis as the bioassay model. Both bioactive ingredients had no effect on all tested fungi. In summary, indigo naturalis prepared from Strobilanthes formosanus Moore exhibits antimicrobial effects on Staphylococcus and non-dermatophytic onychomycosis pathogens. Tryptanthrin and isatin may be its major bioactive ingredients against Staphylococcus and the inhibitory effect on MRSA may be due to other unidentified ingredients. © 2013 by the authors.

84896043112	Coumarin derivatives, but not coumarin itself, cause skin irritation via topical delivery	Coumarin and its derivatives are widely employed as a fragrance in cosmetics and skin care products. The skin absorption level and possible disruption to the skin by topical application of coumarins were evaluated in this study. Percutaneous absorption of osthole, daphnoretin, coumarin, byakangelicin, and 7-hydroxycoumarin was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Skin physiology measurements and immunoblotting were utilized as methodologies for validating toxicity. The relationship between structures and permeation/toxicity of coumarins was elucidated. Both equimolar concentration and saturated solubility in 30% ethanol were used as the applied dose. Osthole with the most lipophilic characteristic demonstrated the greatest skin accumulation, followed by coumarin and 7-hydroxycoumarin. Coumarin was the permeant with the highest flux across the skin. The trend of in vivo deposition was consistent with that of the in vitro profiles. Skin uptake of osthole was 8-fold higher than that of coumarin. Hair follicles played a significant role as a pathway for transport of coumarin according to the examination of follicular accumulation. Osthole and 7-hydroxycoumarin slightly, but significantly, enhanced transepidermal water loss after a consecutive 5-day administration. The immunoblotting profiling verified the role of proliferation in skin damage induced by osthole, byakangelicin, and 7-hydroxycoumarin. The proliferation-related proteins examined in this work included glucose-regulated proteins, cytokeratin, and C-myc. Daphnoretin and coumarin showed a negligible alteration on protein biomarkers. The experimental results suggested that skin irritation caused by coumarins was mainly derived from the analogs but not from coumarin itself. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84905841709	Augmented cellular uptake of nanoparticles using tea catechins: Effect of surface modification on nanoparticle-cell interaction	Nanoparticles may serve as carriers in targeted therapeutics; interaction of the nanoparticles with a biological system may determine their targeting effects and therapeutic efficacy. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major component of tea catechins, has been conjugated with nanoparticles and tested as an anticancer agent. We investigated whether EGCG may enhance nanoparticle uptake by tumor cells. Cellular uptake of a dextran-coated magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) was determined by confocal microscopy, flow cytometry or a potassium thiocyanate colorimetric method. We demonstrated that EGCG greatly enhanced interaction and/or internalization of MNPs (with or without polyethylene glycol) by glioma cells, but not vascular endothelial cells. The enhancing effects are both time- and concentration-dependent. Such effects may be induced by a simple mix of MNPs with EGCG at a concentration as low as 1-3 μM, which increased MNP uptake 2- to 7-fold. In addition, application of magnetic force further potentiated MNP uptake, suggesting a synergetic effect of EGCG and magnetic force. Because the effects of EGCG were preserved at 4 °C, but not when EGCG was removed from the culture medium prior to addition of MNPs, a direct interaction of EGCG and MNPs was implicated. Use of an MNP-EGCG composite produced by adsorption of EGCG and magnetic separation also led to an enhanced uptake. The results reveal a novel interaction of a food component and nanocarrier system, which may be potentially amenable to magnetofection, cell labeling/tracing, and targeted therapeutics. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.
