84937142560	An efficient coding method for coding Region-of-Interest locations in AVS2	Region-of-Interest (ROI) location information in videos has many practical usages in video coding field, such as video content analysis and user experience improvement. Although ROI-based coding has been studied widely by many researchers to improve coding efficiency for video contents, the ROI location information itself is seldom coded in video bitstream. In this paper, we will introduce our proposed ROI location coding tool which has been adopted in surveillance profile of AVS2 video coding standard (surveillance profile). Our tool includes three schemes: direct-coding scheme, differential- coding scheme, and reconstructed-coding scheme. We will illustrate the details of these schemes, and perform analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, respectively.

84940330596	Flexible image similarity computation using hyper-spatial matching	Spatial pyramid matching (SPM) has been widely used to compute the similarity of two images in computer vision and image processing. While comparing images, SPM implicitly assumes that: in two images from the same category, similar objects will appear in similar locations. However, this is not always the case. In this paper, we propose hyper-spatial matching (HSM), a more flexible image similarity computing method, to alleviate the mis-matching problem in SPM. The match between corresponding regions, HSM considers the relationship of all spatial pairs in two images, which includes more meaningful match than SPM. We propose two learning strategies to learn SVM models with the proposed HSM kernel in image classification, which are hundreds of times faster than a general purpose SVM solver applied to the HSM kernel (in both training and testing). We compare HSM and SPM on several challenging benchmarks, and show that HSM is better than SPM in describing image similarity. © 2013 IEEE.

32544449929	Moving vehicles segmentation based on Gaussian motion model	Moving objects segmentation is a challenge in computer vision. This paper focuses on the segmentation of moving vehicles in dynamic scene. We analyses the psychology of human vision and present a framework for segmenting moving vehicles in the highway. The proposed framework consists of two parts. Firstly, we propose an adaptive background update method in which the background is updated according to the change of illumination conditions and thus can adapt to the change of illumination sensitively. Secondly, we construct a Gaussian motion model to segment moving vehicles, in which the motion vectors of the moving pixels are modeled as a Gaussian model and an on-line EM algorithm is used to update the model. The Gaussian distribution of the adaptive model is elevated to determine which moving vectors result from moving vehicles and which from other moving objects such as waving trees. Finally, the pixels with motion vector result from the moving vehicles are segmented. Experimental results of several typical scenes show that the proposed model can detect the moving vehicles correctly and is immune from influence of the moving objects caused by the waving trees and the vibration of camera.

79952024501	A fast sub-pixel motion estimation algorithm for H.264/AVC video coding	Motion estimation (ME) is one of the most time-consuming parts in video coding. The use of multiple partition sizes in H.264/AVC makes it even more complicated when compared to ME in conventional video coding standards. It is important to develop fast and effective sub-pixel ME algorithms since: 1) the computation overhead by sub-pixel ME has become relatively significant while the complexity of integer-pixel search has been greatly reduced by fast algorithms, and 2) reducing sub-pixel search points can greatly save the computation for sub-pixel interpolation. In this letter, a novel fast sub-pixel ME algorithm is proposed which performs a rough sub-pixel search before the partition selection, and performs a precise sub-pixel search for the best partition. By reducing the searching load for the large number of non-best partitions, the computation complexity for sub-pixel search can be greatly decreased. Experimental results show that our method can reduce the sub-pixel search points by more than 50% compared to existing fast sub-pixel ME methods with negligible quality degradation. © 2011 IEEE.

79955667457	Self-synthesis with sparse prior for image interpolation	Image interpolation addresses the problem of obtaining high resolution (HR) images from its low resolution (LR) counterparts. For observed LR images with aliasing artifacts caused by undersampling, commonly used interpolation methods cannot recover HR images well, and may often interpolate over-fitting artifacts. In this paper, based on the observation that natural images normally have redundant similar patches, a new patch-synthesis-based interpolation method is proposed for image interpolation. In the proposed method, an inference method based on Markov chain is adopted to select the best patches from the input LR image and synthesize them into the undersampled areas of a desired HR image. In order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, we also introduce fields of experts to model the sparse prior knowledge and use it to measure the compatibilities among neighboring patches. Experimental results compared with traditional interpolation methods demonstrate that our method cannot only alleviate the aliasing artifact, but also produce better results in terms of quantitative evaluation and subjective visual quality. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

79960558169	A rate-control algorithm using inter-layer information for H.264/SVC for low-delay applications	This paper proposes a novel frame-level rate-control scheme for H.264/SVC for low-delay applications. The trend of the Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) (after motion compensation) of the reference layer is used as the inter-layer information for Inter-layer MAD prediction, which is combined with Intra-layer MAD prediction to predict the MAD of the enhancement layers (EL) more accurately. By considering the influence from both the texture and nontexture information, the varying picture complexity and feedback information from the actual encoding results are combined to achieve an accurate bit-allocation. A coarse-to-fine initial quantization parameter (QP) selection method is proposed to refine the initial QP of the EL according to the channel condition and the video sequence characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can obtain high and smooth PSNR, and the output bit-rate is close to the target bit-rate. Also, the proposed scheme can avoid serious buffer fullness fluctuation and reduce skipped frames in the video coding. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

79960683348	Integrating visual saliency and consistency for re-ranking image search results	In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for image re-ranking in web image search applications. The proposed method focuses on investigating the following two mechanisms: 1) Visual consistency. In most web image search cases, the images that closely related to the search query are visually similar. These visually consistent images which occur most frequently in the first few web pages will be given higher ranks. 2) Visual saliency. From visual aspect, it is obvious that salient images would be easier to catch users' eyes, and it is observed that these visually salient images in the front pages are often relevant to the user's query. By integrating the above two mechanisms, our method can efficiently re-rank the images from search engines and obtain a more satisfactory search result.

Firstly, we propose an MR extraction method by combining the inter-layer and inter-frame information. The difference between the current frame and the previous frame is used as the inter-frame information to detect moving areas. The motion information of the reference layer is used as the inter-layer information to combine with the inter-frame information to achieve a suitable MR extraction. Secondly, according to the coding result of the reference layer, we propose to sub-divide the non-MR into complex regions and flat regions based on a MacroBlock (MB) complexity measure.

80155135737	Hypothesis comparison guided cross validation for unsupervised signer adaptation	Signer adaptation is important to sign language recognition systems in that a one-size-fits-all model set can not perform well on all kinds of signers. Supervised signer adaptation must utilize the labeled adaptation data that are collected explicitly. To skip the data collecting process in signer adaptation, we propose an unsupervised adaptation method called hypothesis comparison guided cross validation (HC-CV) algorithm. The algorithm not only addresses the problem of overlap between the data set to be labeled and the data set for adaptation, but also employs an additional hypothesis comparison step to decrease the noise rate of the adaptation data set. Experimental results show that the HC-CV adaptation algorithm is superior to the CV adaptation algorithm and the conventional self-teaching algorithm. Though the algorithm is proposed for signer adaptation, it can also be applied to speaker adaptation and writer adaptation straightforwardly. © 2011 IEEE.

84861366074	Learning-based super-resolution method with a combining of both global and local constraints	Learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods are popular in many applications recently. In these methods, the high-frequency details are usually found or combined through patch matching from training database. However, the representation ability of small patch is limited and it is difficult to guarantee that the super-resolved image is the best under the global view. To this end, the authors propose a statistical learning method for SR with both global and local constraints. More specifically, they introduce a mixture model into maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, which combines a global parametric constraint with a patch-based local non-parametric constraint. The global parametric constraint guarantees the super-resolved global image to agree with the sparse property of natural images, and the local non-parametric constraint is used to infer the residues between the image derived from the global constraint and the ground truth high-resolution (HR) image. Compared with the traditional patch-based learning methods without the global constraint, our method can not only preserve global image structure, but also restore the local details more effectively.

84863059649	Multiscale semilocal interpolation with antialiasing	Aliasing is a common artifact in low-resolution (LR) images generated by a downsampling process. Recovering the original high-resolution image from its LR counterpart while at the same time removing the aliasing artifacts is a challenging image interpolation problem. Since a natural image normally contains redundant similar patches, the values of missing pixels can be available at texture-relevant LR pixels. Based on this, we propose an iterative multiscale semilocal interpolation method that can effectively address the aliasing problem. The proposed method estimates each missing pixel from a set of texture-relevant semilocal LR pixels with the texture similarity iteratively measured from a sequence of patches of varying sizes. Specifically, in each iteration, top texture-relevant LR pixels are used to construct a data fidelity term in a maximum a posteriori estimation, and a bilateral total variation is used as the regularization term. Experimental results compared with existing interpolation methods demonstrate that our method can not only substantially alleviate the aliasing problem but also produce better results across a wide range of scenes both in terms of quantitative evaluation and subjective visual quality. © 2011 IEEE.

84874032274	Inferring user image-search goals by mining query logs with semi-supervised spectral clustering	Inferring user search goals for a query can be very useful in improving search engine relevance and user experience. Although the research on analyzing user goals or intents for text search has received much attention, little has been proposed for image search. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to infer user search goals in image search by mining search engine query logs with semi-supervised spectral clustering. We combine the visual information of the clicked images with user click information by using graph-based models and then cluster the images with spectral clustering to capture user image-search goals. Experimental results based on a popular commercial search engine demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.

84874409801	Abnormal crowd behavior detection based on local pressure model	Abnormal crowd behavior detection is an important issue in crowd surveillance. In this paper, a novel local pressure model is proposed to detect the abnormality in large-scale crowd scene based on local crowd characteristics. These characteristics include the local density and velocity which are very significant parameters for measuring the dynamic of crowd. A grid of particles is placed over the image to reduce the computation of the local crowd parameters. Local pressure is generated by applying these local characteristics in pressure model. Histogram is utilized to extract the statistical property of the magnitude and direction of the pressure. The crowd feature vector of the whole frame is obtained through the analysis of Histogram of Oriented Pressure (HOP). SVM and median filter are then adopted to detect the anomaly. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on publicly available datasets from UMN. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a higher accuracy than that of the previous methods on detecting abnormal crowd behavior. © 2012 APSIPA.

84874035158	A patch-based framework for detecting abnormal activities with a PTZ camera	In this paper, a novel patch-based (PB) framework is proposed for detecting abnormal activities using a Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera. We first propose a new scene-patch-based (SSB) algorithm which can efficiently extract the target object's global trajectory from the PTZ camera. Furthermore, we propose an extended network-based (ENB) algorithm for detecting abnormal activities. The proposed ENB algorithm models the entire scene as a network where each node in the network corresponds to a patch of the scene and each edge between nodes corresponds to the activity correlation between the scene patchs. Based on this network, a recursive training strategy is proposed to train the edge weights in the network such that abnormal activities can be effectively detected through these trained edge weights. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. © 2012 IEEE.

84874420714	Periodic motion detection with ROI-based similarity measure and extrema-based reference-frame selection	This paper presents a new algorithm for detecting and analyzing the periodic motions in video sequences. Different from the previous methods which detect periodic motions from the entire frame, we propose a convex-hull-based process to automatically determine the regions of interest (ROI) of the motions and utilize an ROI-based similarity measure to detect the motion periods. Furthermore, we also propose an extrema-based method to select the optimal reference frame for further improving the periodic detection performance. Our proposed algorithm can not only effectively detect motion periods with both constant and variable period lengths, but also have obvious advantage when handling periodic motion with slight movements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2012 APSIPA.

84875749120	Region-based rate control for H.264/AVC for low bit-rate applications	Rate control plays an important role in video coding. However, in the conventional rate control algorithms, the number and position of macroblocks (MBs) inside one basic unit for rate control is inflexible and predetermined. The different characteristics of the MBs are not fully considered. Also, there is no overall optimization of the coding of basic units. This paper proposes a new region-based rate control scheme for H.264/advanced video coding to improve the coding efficiency. The inter-frame information is explored to objectively divide one frame into multiple regions based on their rate-distortion (R-D) behaviors. The MBs with similar characteristics are classified into the same region, and the entire region, instead of a single MB or a group of contiguous MBs, is treated as a basic unit for rate control. A linear rate-quantization stepsize model and a linear distortion-quantization stepsize model are proposed to accurately describe the R-D characteristics for the region-based basic units. Moreover, based on the above linear models, an overall optimization model is proposed to obtain suitable quantization parameters for the region-based basic units. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed region-based rate control approach can achieve both better subjective and objective quality by performing the rate control adaptively with the content, compared to the conventional rate control approaches. © 2012 IEEE.

84875019640	An efficient framework for recognizing traffic lights in night traffic images	In this paper, we propose a new and efficient framework for detecting and recognizing traffic signal lights with the corresponding countdown counters in the night scenes. The proposed framework first compares the difference between the daytime and night situation of traffic lights in the image and locate the recognition candidates in the HLC color space. With the locating of the main location marks, the shooting angle direction could be corrected. Based on the frontal direction, the content of the traffic lights can be recognized with the template matching measure. Furthermore, in order to reduce computation, a complexity reducing method is proposed. Experimental results on various scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. © 2012 IEEE.

84875877457	Exclusive visual descriptor quantization	Vector quantization (VQ) using exhaustive nearest neighbor (NN) search is the speed bottleneck in classic bag of visual words (BOV) models. Approximate NN (ANN) search methods still cost great time in VQ, since they check multiple regions in the search space to reduce VQ errors. In this paper, we propose ExVQ, an exclusive NN search method to speed up BOV models. Given a visual descriptor, a portion of search regions is excluded from the whole search space by a linear projection. We ensure that minimal VQ errors are introduced in the exclusion by learning an accurate classifier. Multiple exclusions are organized in a tree structure in ExVQ, whose VQ speed and VQ error rate can be reliably estimated. We show that ExVQ is much faster than state-of-the-art ANN methods in BOV models while maintaining almost the same classification accuracy. In addition, we empirically show that even with the VQ error rate as high as 30%, the classification accuracy of some ANN methods, including ExVQ, is similar to that of exhaustive search (which has zero VQ error). In some cases, ExVQ has even higher classification accuracy than the exhaustive search. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

84877639552	Adaptive scheduling for multicasting hard deadline constrained prioritized data via network coding	Network coding offers a promising platform for multicast transmission by approaching its min-cut capacity. However, pushing the network throughput toward this upper bound comes with a sacrifice in delivery delay due to the decoding procedure that requires performing batch of coded packets. Further, in some transmission scenarios where the receivers experience deep fading or unable to collect a full set of the transmitted data, no useful information is recovered. The effect is more severe in the networks where the transmitted information has priority structure with hard deadline constraint due to the limited delivery time and data interdependencies. In this paper, we consider single-hop wireless networks where the transmitter wishes to multicast hard deadline constrained prioritized data to many receivers over lossy channels. We first study the network performance of a variety of transmission techniques, depending on how the transmitter schedules transmission in each time slot. We then propose an adaptive encoding and scheduling technique to maximize the network throughput. To find the optimal transmission scheduling at the presence of the network dynamics, we cast the problem in the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and use backward induction method to find an optimal solution. We further propose simulation-based algorithm and greedy scheduling technique that obtain high performance with much lower time complexity. Both analytical and simulation results have been provided to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2012 IEEE.

84877645258	Distributed optimal power control for multicarrier cognitive systems	In this paper, the power optimization of the multicarrier cognitive system underlying the primary network is investigated. We consider the interference coupled cognitive network under individual secondary user's power constraint and primary user's rate constraint. A multicarrier discrete distributed (MCDD) algorithm based on Gibbs sampler is proposed. Although the problem is nonconcave, MCDD is proved to converge to the global optimal solution. To reduce the computational complexity and convergence time, the Gibbs sampler based Lagrangian algorithm (GSLA) is proposed to get a near optimal solution. We also provide simulation results to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.

84878424676	A coarse to fine facial key landmark points locating algorithm based on active shape model	In this paper, we proposed an improved coarse to fine improved algorithm to enhance the accuracy of facial key landmark points locating. Based on the analysis of PCA, the proposed algorithm redesigns the parameter update rule through adding a monotonically decreasing inert factor function to the traditional ASM iterations (D-ASM). The new rule could update parameters at a finer process. Besides, we compare the performances of different types of inert factor functions and select the suitable one. Furthermore, we further design a classifier-based algorithm for the more accurate locating of 2D key corner points. Finally, local D-ASM is constructed and the inner landmarks are further fitting with corner points fixed. Experimental results on various faces demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed algorithm. © 2012 IEEE.

84878446262	Recognizing human group behaviors with multi-group causalities	Human group behaviors are usually composed of several sub-groups. Considering the interaction between groups, this paper presents an algorithm to recognize human group behavior with multi-group causalities. It has two main contributions: (1) we introduce inter-group causality to reflect the interaction between human groups, (2) an improved coding scheme (i.e. Locality-constrained Linear Coding) is used for encoding the causality to go beyond Vector Quantization (VQ). Finally, a simple linear SVM is adopted to learn this model. Our experiment results demonstrate that inter-group causality feature and LLC methods can significantly boost behavior recognition performance. © 2012 IEEE.

84883391287	A new Local-Main-Gradient-Orientation HOG and contour differences based algorithm for object classification	This paper presents a new algorithm to better classify objects in videos. In our case, the objects are cars, vans, and people on the roads. First, in order to extract the moving objects more precisely, we have proposed a method for foreground extraction based on the contour differences between the video frame and the background image. Second, after we got the integrated moving object, we have proposed a new algorithm to extract better features from the object. The new algorithm is based on two extended Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) descriptor. We have improved HOG in two aspects: (a) selecting the gradient information from the moving objects and discarding the background gradient; (b) weighting every bin of gradient orientation histogram according to their significance within predefined area, in order to emphasize the important gradient information. We obtained Contour-Difference HOG (CD-HOG) from the first extension and Local-Main-Gradient-Orientation HOG (LMGO-HOG) from the second extended HOG. These extensions can cope with the cluttered background and make the features more distinguishable. Each of the extended HOG descriptors can produce a satisfying performance separately and an even better one if they are applied in cascade. From extensive evaluations, we showed the wonderful performance of our algorithm, and the accuracy rate of 94.04% can be achieved in some cases. © 2013 IEEE.

84884589717	Improved image deblurring based on salient-region segmentation	Image deblurring techniques play important roles in many image processing applications. As the blur varies spatially across the image plane, it calls for robust and effective methods to deal with the spatially-variant blur problem. In this paper, a Saliency-based Deblurring (SD) approach is proposed based on the saliency detection for salient-region segmentation and a corresponding compensate method for image deblurring. We also propose a PDE-based deblurring method which introduces an anisotropic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) model for latent image prediction and employs an adaptive optimization model in the kernel estimation and deconvolution steps.

84888231913	A new algorithm for compressing massive region-of-interest location information in videos	Region-of-Interest (ROI) location information in videos is of increasing importance in many applications including user interest analysis and user experience improvement. Although ROI-based coding has been studied by many researchers, most of the works only focus on using the ROI information for improving coding efficiency while the ROI location information itself is seldom coded or transmitted. Though some methods can recover the ROI locations at the decoder by some parameters such as the quantization parameter, they will fail to work when the number of ROIs becomes large or the ROIs become overlapping. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to compress this massive ROI location information in videos. The proposed algorithm introduces the region position information extracted from the reconstructed frame as the reference to reduce the ROI location data. Furthermore, the temporal correlations among ROIs in neighboring frames are also utilized for compressing the ROI locations. By suitably integrating the extracted region position as well as the temporal correlation, the proposed algorithm can reduce the data by about 20% for videos with 30 ROI regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

With the proposed network models, human group activities can be modeled as the package transmission process in the network. Thus, by analyzing the energy consumption situation in these specific "package transmission" processes, various group activities can be effectively detected.

84896356683	Facial expression cloning with elastic and muscle models	Expression cloning plays an important role in facial expression synthesis. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for facial expression cloning. The proposed algorithm first introduces a new elastic model to balance the global and local warping effects, such that the impacts from facial feature diversity among people can be minimized, and thus more effective geometric warping results can be achieved. Furthermore, a muscle-distribution-based (MD) model is proposed, which utilizes the muscle distribution of the human face and results in more accurate facial illumination details. In addition, we also propose a new distance-based metric to automatically select the optimal parameters such that the global and local warping effects in the elastic model can be suitably balanced. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84896519232	Inferring user image-search goals under the implicit guidance of users	The analysis of user search goals for a query can be very useful in improving search engine relevance and user experience. Although the research on inferring user goals or intents for text search has received much attention, little has been proposed for image search. In this paper, we propose to leverage click session information, which indicates high correlations among the clicked images in a session in user click-through logs, and combine it with the clicked images' visual information for inferring user image-search goals. Since the click session information can serve as past users' implicit guidance for clustering the images, more precise user search goals can be obtained. Two strategies are proposed to combine image visual information with the click session information. Furthermore, a classification risk based approach is also proposed for automatically selecting the optimal number of search goals for a query. Experimental results based on a popular commercial search engine demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.

84906517158	Finding coherent motions and semantic regions in crowd scenes: A diffusion and clustering approach	This paper addresses the problem of detecting coherent motions in crowd scenes and subsequently constructing semantic regions for activity recognition. We first introduce a coarse-to-fine thermal-diffusion-based approach. It processes input motion fields (e.g., optical flow fields) and produces a coherent motion filed, named as thermal energy field. The thermal energy field is able to capture both motion correlation among particles and the motion trends of individual particles which are helpful to discover coherency among them. We further introduce a two-step clustering process to construct stable semantic regions from the extracted time-varying coherent motions. Finally, these semantic regions are used to recognize activities in crowded scenes. Experiments on various videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

84908395701	Early detection of all-zero 4 × 4 blocks in High Efficiency Video Coding	Similar to previous video coding standards, transform and quantization are employed in the most recent video coding standard High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), and there exist a large number of transform coefficients being quantized to zeros. In order to reduce the computations in transform and quantization, a novel prediction algorithm is designed to early detect all-zero 4×4 blocks prior to transform and quantization. A theoretical analysis is performed on the 4×4 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the related quantization functions in HEVC; consequently, two sufficient conditions to early detect all-zero 4×4 blocks are derived and the proposed prediction algorithm is developed while balancing the detection efficiency and computational overheads. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to efficiently predict all-zero 4×4 blocks and reduce redundant DCT and quantization computations while maintaining the same coding performance in terms of video quality and bit rates.

84911433150	Towards good practices for action video encoding	High dimensional representations such as VLAD or FV have shown excellent accuracy in action recognition. This paper shows that a proper encoding built upon VLAD can achieve further accuracy boost with only negligible computational cost. We empirically evaluated various VLAD improvement technologies to determine good practices in VLAD-based video encoding. Furthermore, we propose an interpretation that VLAD is a maximum entropy linear feature learning process. Combining this new perspective with observed VLAD data distribution properties, we propose a simple, lightweight, but powerful bimodal encoding method. Evaluated on 3 benchmark action recognition datasets (UCF101, HMDB51 and Youtube), the bimodal encoding improves VLAD by large margins in action recognition.

We first propose to derive scene-related equipotential lines for points in a motion trajectory and concatenate them to construct a 3D tube for representing the trajectory. Based on this 3D tube, a droplet-based method is further proposed which derives a "water droplet" from the 3D tube and recognizes trajectory activities accordingly. Our proposed 3D tube can effectively embed both motion and scene-related information of a motion trajectory while the proposed dropletbased method can suitably catch the characteristics of the 3D tube for activity recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
