29244476284	Experiment on mechanism of slope failure of debris flow fan and stability analysis	Failure of debris flow fan is distinct from the common rock and soil slope failure due to the unique geotechnical features of debris flow sediment. Unfortunately, this type of failure was not comprehensively and systematically studied in the past. In our recent research, according to the unique characters of debris flow fan the Spencert slicing method with varying side force inclination is used to search for the noncircular critical slip surface. This is done using Spreadsheet-automated constrained optimization. The results are then compared with the in-situ slip surface. A practical subroutine is developed to interpret the stability of slope with varying physical parameters along the depth by using Visual Basic Application embedded in Microsoft Excel. The in-situ experiment shows that the water content hardly change 50 cm beneath the slope surface and no obvious tension cracks are observed behind the slope. However in the soil layer where the actual sliding occurred, great alteration of water content under concentrated artificial rainfall happened, which is in consistent with the results of numerical simulation. With the increase in height of the soil layer, the calculated safety factor gradually decreases and an optimized noncircular slip surface with an average height of 2.4 m is obtained satisfying all the constrains and assumptions. It can be inferred that the slope failure of the debris flow fan is attributed to the dynamic seepage force caused by hydraulic gradient; and the slicing method is not suitable for the research of the mechanism of failure of debris flow fan.

33749675102	Self-organization criticality of debris flow rheology	Based on the viewpoint of stress and strain self-organization criticality of debris flow mass, this paper probes into inter-nonlinear action between different factors in the thixotropic liquefaction system of loose clastic soil on slope to make clastic soil in slope develop naturally towards critical stress status, and slope debris flow finally occurs under trigging by rainstorm. Also according to observation and analysis of self-organization criticality of sediment runoff system of viscous debris flow surges in ravines and power relation between magnitude and frequency of debris flows, this paper expounds similarity of the self-organized structure of debris flow mass. The self-organized critical system is a weak chaotic system. Debris flow occurrences can be predicted accordingly by means of observation at certain time scale and analysis of self-organization criticality of magnitude, frequency and time interval of debris flows.

34547665009	Fractal structure of debris flow	One of the most remarkable characteristics of debris flow is the competence for supporting boulders on the surface of flow, which strongly suggests that there should be some structure in the fluid body. This paper analyzed the grain compositions from various samples of debris flows and then revealed the fractal structure. Specifically, the fractality holds in three domains that can be respectively identified as the slurry, matrix, and the coarse content. Furthermore, the matrix fractal, which distinguishes debris flow from other kinds of flows, involves a hierarchical structure in the sense that it might contain ever increasing grains while the total range of grain size increases. It provides a possible mechanism for the boulder suspension. © 2007 Wuhan University.

33645760239	Artificial rainfall experimental study on landslide translation to debris flow	It is important to grasp the process of landslide translation to debris flow on the basis of the experiment of landslide translation to debris flow. Four artificial rainfall experiments have been carried out at Wanfangzi, located in the debris flow source area of Jiangjia Ravine, and other four experiments have been performed at the deposit area. The Jiangjia Ravine is a famous debris flow gully. After investigating whole drainage area, the conditions and locations of these experiments are determined. In the process of these experiments, some soil parameters have been measured through some advanced equipments. These parameters are water potential, water content, pore water pressure and soil temperature. After primary analysis have been completed, some basic characteristics of wide-graded gravel soil are presented. Main conclusions include: (1) under the strong-intense rainfall, the mechanism of landslide translation to debris flow is the vibration softening or the vibration liquefaction, and the soil strength can be expressed by the function of grain grade, saturation, and pore water pressure induced by the vibration and infiltration rate; (2) when soil is broken, the soil may be unsaturated, so the mechanism of saturation liquefaction has not been applied; (3) when the curve of water potential declines, the process of soil strength fluctuation will be validated; (4) the energy exchange exists in the process of soil break; and (5) under the strong-intensity rainfall, it is difficult to distinguish the start of landslide against the formation of debris flow, because the characteristics of debris flow appear when soil is broke.

79952434658	Phugoid dynamic characteristic of hypersonic gliding vehicles	This paper focuses on the phugoid dynamic characteristic of hypersonic gliding vehicle. By regarding equilibrium glide as the fixed state of reentry trajectory, the dynamic equations are simplified and a hyper-geometric equation with a forcing function is deduced. Linearization theory is applied to analyze the characteristic of the motion, and the phugoid mode is found to be stable. An analytical solution of flight path angle as a function of speed is derived based on General Multiple Scale theory. The dynamic characteristic is analyzed, and the analytic solution is found to be in good agreement with the numerical simulation. When the initial states do not satisfy equilibrium glide condition or perturbation occurs, a damped oscillation along the equilibrium glide trajectory would occur. The damping diminishes as the speed decreases. The number of oscillations is decided by the lift-to-drag ratio, the initial altitude and the initial/final speed. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

80052885205	Monitoring and warning of landslides and debris flows using an optical fiber sensor technology	Landslides and debris flows are typical geo-hazards which occur in hilly or mountainous regions. Debris flows may result from landslides. Geotechnical instrumentation plays an important role in monitoring and warning of landslides and resulted debris flows. Traditional technologies for monitoring landslides and debris flows have certain limitations. The new optical fiber sensors presented in this paper can overcome those limitations. This paper presents two new optical fiber sensor systems: one is the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based in-place inclinometer for monitoring landslides and the other is the FBG-based column-net system for monitoring debris flows. This paper presents the calibration results of FBG-based in-place inclinometers in laboratory. It is found that the calibration results are in good agreement with theoretical results. Both the FBG-based in-place inclinometers and the FBG-based column-net system have been installed at a site in Weijiagou valley, Beichuan County, Sichuan Province of China. Some preliminary results have been obtained and reported in the paper.

84861603082	Movement pattern of debris flow	A kinematic model is developed to estimate the velocity and runout distance of a gravitative debris flow. The characteristics and the different stages of development of a gravitative flow are first described. The equations governing the motion during the flow are then derived based on the Newtonian translation motion with some simplified assumptions on the erosion process along the flow path. After the motion is initiated, the debris is considered to behave as a frictional material with the friction angle during motion being a function of the distance travelled measured from the initiation point. The equations derived are applied to two well-documented case records to assess their applicability. The application shows that the computed runout distances are slightly higher than the measured values. This slight error on the safe side is consistent with the simplified assumptions used in deriving the equations. The small error is acceptable for engineering designs in areas vulnerable to debris flows. © 2011 Casa Editrice Università La Sapienza.

84867858714	Numerical simulation on the aerodynamic performance of hypersonic glide vehicle	The waverider is considered as an important candidate for the configuration of hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) in terms of its high lift-to-drag ratio. Due to the severe aerodynamic heating, the sharp leading edge of waverider need be blunted, and the flow characteristics and the aerodynamic performance along the trajectory will change. In the current research, the flow characteristic of a HGV was studied based on a reference trajectory, and a numerical simulation was carried out to evaluate the performance of HGV with a blunt leading edge under a typical condition. The result indicates that the flow near the stagnation point exhibits three-dimensionality which cannot be approximated as a flow around a sphere or cylinder; the heat flux can be reduced and the aerodynamic performance of HGV may decrease as well when the leading edge is blunted: under the condition of 2 cm radii, the lift-to-drag ratio reduces by 12.34%, and different thermal protection methods can be used in different places of HGV.

43549100228	Wavelet entropy measure definition and its application for transmission line fault detection and identification (part III: Transmission line faults transients identification)	Detecting and classifying transient signal have been concerned with by researchers recently, at home and broad. Especially, there are still many difficulties in classification. Based on the PSCAD/EMTDC model of a practical 500kV transmission line set in part II, six transient signals are simulated, such as breaker operation, capacitor switching, single-phase to ground, primary arc, and lighting strokes with and without fault. As its definition is given in this paper, multi-scales wavelet energy spectrum entropy, combined with neural network, has excellent ability in transient signal classification, especially between fault and non-fault ones. The faulty phase selection of short-circuit is completed on the base of wavelet energy spectrum entropy and fuzzy logic defined in part I. Experiment results show that wavelet energy spectrum entropy of transient signal is characteristic, and BP neural network is efficient in classifying, and fault phase selection using fuzzy inference is effective too. From the research, it is obvious that wavelet entropy application has a bright future in electronic power system. © 2006 IEEE.

67649180389	Design of the geohazard monitoring and warning system in Wenchuan earthquake area	The Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008 has induced many secondary disasters, such as collapse, landslide, and dammed lake. These provide conditions for debris flows, which are expected to be one of the major disasters in the quake area in the coming years. A network of monitoring and warning of the geohazards is urgent for the hazard mitigation and homeland reconstruction. About 2998 monitoring sites and six systems are planned in the quake area of Sichuan. These systems should be automatic and timing, with low power cost, wireless communication, and proper power support. The monitored objects and monitoring methods are designed following the existing system at home and abroad. A systematic imagine is proposed on base of the previous studies. The system consists mainly of the forming conditions, stimulus factors, information management platform, and alarming block. Two special techniques are analyzed in details: The critical indices for hazard formation and the networks of information transfer. For the latter, a wireless sensor network is introduced, which arises as a new method in acquiring information with variety of network forms. Such a network can be randomly distributed, self-organized, and run in coopera-tion. Combining with the statewide cellular base stations of China Mobile and China Unicom, the system can run in long-term to monitor landslides, dammed lakes, and debris flows from different viewpoints and release alarms. Fi-nally, a flow framework is plotted according to the objects of monitoring.

67649183623	Optimal timing for the control of debris flow in Wenchuan Earthquake area	The Wenchuan earthquake on May 12, 2008 has induced many secondary disasters, such as collapses, landslides, dammed lakes, and a great area of loose soils and rocks. The debris flows of larger scales may occur at the stimulus of rainstorms that would cause events of ordinary scales before the quake. Based on the analysis of historic debris flows following the earthquakes and the debris flows in 2008, the optimal opportunity of controlling the potential debris flows was considered. The results indicated that the control measures should be taken three to five years later in the central quake-hit areas. In other affected areas the engineering structures can be extensively made. It is suggested that the projects on the debris flows mitigation works in the most severe areas should be postponed up to three to five years.

67649240495	Distribution and risk analysis of dammed lakes reduced by Wenchuan earthquake	On 12 May 2008, a devastating mega-earthquake of magnitude 8.0 struck the Wenchuan area, northwestern Sichuan province, China. Wenchuan earthquake with Seismic has intensity 11 inevitably impaired the stability of mountains in the course of massive reverse-thrust strike-slip motion in the fault zone. Geohazards approaching of about 20 thousands were triggered with the types of rock fall, rock avalanches, landslides, debris flows, and earthquake-lakes. The features of the debris dams were examined using the 124 breadth of ADS40 images obtained by airplane during 15 to 28 May 2008, which figured out the 256 dammed lakes with the features of distributing along ruptured zone and river channel. The farther analysis found that the number of dammed lakes reduce with the increase of distance to rupture and obey exponential relation with the correlation coefficient of 0.9699. According to the investigation data, a quick risk evaluation on the potential of outburst of dammed lakes was performed using the indices of material composition of dam, dam height, and water storage capacity of the dam. The dammed lakes were classified as extremely high risk, high risk, medium risk and low risk. The failure risk of 21 debris dams were evaluated according to the indices as 1 with an extremely high danger risk, 7 with a high danger, 5 with a medium danger and 8 of low danger. The risk evaluation result was totally accepted by state earthquake disaster relief office. And emergency dam treatment for risk reduction was planned based on the assessment which was carried out in successful. The earthquake destroyed the stability of the slopes and produced numerous loose soil and debris in tributaries, which resulting in a prolonged geo-hazards for the area. Landslides and debris flows will continue to develop for at least five to ten years after the Wenchuan earthquake and will cause additional dammed lakes. After then, the probability of dammed lake formation will go down as less activation of landslides and debris-flows.

70249105363	The blunt leading edge's influence to the performance of waverider	The designing of high L/D aircraft based on waverider is an effective approach for new hypersonic aircraft aerodynamic shape design. Restricted by aerodynamic heat and processing technique, the sharp leading edge of waverider needs to be blunted. In order to study the blunt leading edge's influence to the performance of waverider, the computational fluid dynamics tool is used to study different blunt radius' influence to waverider's aero force and aero heat performance. The results show that blunt leading edge could reduce the maximum heat flux effectively, but it also reduced the aerodynamic performance. As the blunt radius increases, the aerodynamic performance reduced significantly, but its influence to the heat flux wears off. When designing the aerodynamic shape of hypersonic aircraft, the influence of bluntness to aerodynamic force and heat flux should be considered synthetically and the best balance point should be founded.

The wedge angles were taken as optimum characters in this optimum design. In the design, the difference is considered of flow field between windward side and leeward side for the missile with a large angle of attack. A genetic algorithm, NSGA-II, is adopted here. And the NSGA-II method is improved by adopting a new crossover operator. The optimum design result shows that the value variation trend of total pressure recovery is in accordance with drag coefficient and the flow rate is tightly associated with the value of first wedge angle. Numeral simulation result of the inlet shows that it is acceptable. Such a method is reasonable and can be adopted in preliminary inlet design while large angle of attack considered.

A dynamics model including the Earth rotation and the J2 term perturbation is used to optimize the design, and the accurate atmospheric model is adopted. In the light of the strong nonlinearity and various constraint characteristics of trajectory optimization, traditional trajectory optimization technique is sensitive to the initial guess and it is hard to deal with constraints such as way point and so on; based on a simple and intuitive method to balance conflicting objectives such as accuracy of the solution, convergence, and speed of computation, a grid adaptive-based multiresolution technique is applied to the trajectory optimization of the gliding vehicle, and a corresponding strategy dealing with the state constraints is suggested. A practical trajectory optimization application including way point, prohibited areas and terminal constraints is presented.

77958463596	The Wenchuan Earthquake (May 12, 2008), Sichuan Province, China, and resulting geohazards	On Monday, May 12, 2008, a devastating mega-earthquake of magnitude 8.0 struck the Wenchuan area, northwestern Sichuan Province, China. The focal mechanism of the earthquake was successive massive rock fracturing 15 km in depth at Yingxiu. Seismic analysis confirms that the major shock occurred on the Beichuan-Yingxiu Fault and that aftershocks rapidly extended in a straight northeast-southeast direction along the Longmenshan Fault zone. Fatalities approaching a total of 15,000 occurred, with a significant number resulting from four types of seismically triggered geohazards-rock avalanches and landslides, landslide-dammed lakes ("earthquake lakes"), and debris flows. China Geological Survey has identified 4,970 potentially risky sites, 1,701 landslides, 1,844 rock avalanches, 515 debris flows, and 1,093 unstable slopes. Rock avalanches and landslides caused many fatalities directly and disrupted the transportation system, extensively disrupting rescue efforts and thereby causing additional fatalities. Landslide-dammed lakes not only flooded human habitats in upstream areas but also posed threats to potentially inundated downstream areas with large populations. Debris flows become the most remarkable geohazards featured by increasing number, high frequency, and low triggering rainfall. Earthquake-triggered geohazards sequentially induced and transformed to additional hazards. For example, debris flows occurred on rock avalanches and landslides, followed by landslide-dammed lakes, and then by additional debris flows and breakouts of the landslide-dammed lakes and downstream flooding. Earthquake-induced geohazards occurred mainly along the fault zone and decreased sharply with distance from the fault. It can be anticipated that post-earthquake geohazards, particularly for debris flows, will continue for 5-10 years and even for as long as 20 years. An integrated strategy of continuing emergency response and economic reconstruction is required. The lesson from Wenchuan Earthquake is that the resulted geohazards may appear in large number in active fault regions. A plan for geohazard prevention in the earthquake-active mountainous areas is needed in advance. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77958504122	Nonlinear modified flood method for calculating the debris-flow peak discharge in Wenchuan earthquake region	Mitigating debris-flow hazards is a great challenge in a period after Wenchuan Earthquake. Because of the complexity of debris supply and formation, the debris-flow discharge with respect to flood discharge was amplified in runoff, converging and moving stages of debris flows, and previous methods of calculating debris-flow peak discharge were not available for the debris-flow ravines in the earthquake-affected region. The investigation of the formation of post-quake debris flows indicated that debris-flow hydrologic process is not linearly equivalent with flood hydrologic one, and debris-flow amplification coefficient is not linearly proportional to flood peak discharge. An empirical relationship of power function between the amplification coefficient and the flood peak discharge was built by analyzing the field data of seven debris-flow ravines in Subaohe, Weijiagou and Dubahe basins of the earthquake region. Combined the classical modified flood discharge method with the empirical formula, a nonlinear flood method was developed for calculating debris-flow peak discharge, which can be applicable to post-earthquake region.

The tests of 25 groups were carried out at different slopes using the same soil material to study the debris flow initiation at varies slopes. The results showed that the initiation mode of debris flow was erosion → gully → collapse → block → failure and transformed into debris flow between 8°~12.5° as initiation due to dam-failure. The initiation mode of debris flow was increased erosion gradually (down cut erosion, back word cut and lateral erosion) with the bulk density increasing and transformed into debris flow between 12.5°~17.5° as initiation due to erosion. The initiation mode of debris flow was surface flow → infiltration → failure → fluidization and transformed into debris flow between 17.5°~25° as initiation due to slope failure. The change character of water pore-pressure was different at different slope experiments, and the water pore-pressure inner soil revealed the initiation mechanism of debris flow at different slope.

The great Wenchuan Earthquake of May 12, 2008 created 256 natural dams, of which 34 presented significant risks to downstream areas in the event of their uncontrolled failure. Out of the 34 large landslide dams that warranted mitigation, we discuss Tangjiashan landslide dam in detail. Emergency response to the Tangjiashan landslide-dammed lake in the following weeks and months successfully reduced the risk, and the advantages and disadvantages of various countermeasures that were applied are summarized here. Successful strategies relied on accurate scientific assessments, on timely execution of the countermeasures, and on the correct design of sluiceway (spillway) channels across the landslide dams. Retrospective assessment indicates that the following improvements would be more beneficial: (1) Sluiceway channels utilizing a combination of cross-section types, rather than simply trapezoidal in shape; (2) increased channel slope, which is more than the original gradient of the river; (3) better protection of inlets and outlets to control the planned incision rates; and (4) channels lined to better control the incision rate.

79955996088	Debris flow simulation-oriented three-dimensional scenery modeling and rendering	3D (three-dimensional) process simulation is currently one of the most challenging fields of research on debris flow. Large scale terrain rendering is the most basic task of 3D scenery construction in debris flow simulation. As the major trigger for debris flow, rainfall will substantially enhance the realistic sense. Terrain and rainfall rendering in 3D debris flow simulations poses great challenges for numerical computation and graphical processing capability. In this paper, we propose to integrate GPU technology, LoD algorithms, and particle systems to realize 3D scenery modeling and rendering. The real-time LoD-based terrain modeling and rendering algorithm is presented first, and then a particle system-based rainfall scenery rendering method is implemented. Experimental results demonstrate that the 3D scenery rendered with the proposed approach exhibits sound performance and fair visual effects, which lays a solid foundation for the whole process simulation of debris flow disasters. © 2011 Wuhan University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79957970551	Numerical limit equilibrium method of three-dimensional stability for landslide	The three-dimensional model of slop in numerical calculation is established. And high precision eight-node hexahedron element is used to build the finite element grid of slip layer. The slip layer material is simulated by an ideal elastic-plastic model based on the Mohr-Coulomb Criterion. Three-dimensional stress state and slide direction of the slip layer zone is obtained by numerical computation. So, based on the analysis of the three-dimensional stress state of the slip layer zone, in this article, the author defines the point safety factor as the ratio of the shear strength of the slip zone to the shear stress parallel to the sliding direction, and defines the safety factor of the landslide as the average of the zone point safety factor with its zone as weight number. The sliding mechanism is studied through zone point safety factor, and stability of landslide can be evaluated through the safety factor. Sample case shows that the calculated result is in accordance with the actual case. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

79957981239	Bluntness impact on performance of waverider	Waverider serves as a good candidate for hypersonic vehicles, especially for high lift-to-drag ratio aircraft. Restricted by aerodynamic heat and manufacture techniques, the sharp leading edge of waverider needs to be blunted. In order to study the blunt leading edge's influences on the waverider, computational fluid dynamics tools are used to study the aerodynamic and aero-thermodynamic property of waverider with different blunt radii. The numerical methods are validated by test case and empirical formula. Numerical simulations show that blunting the leading edge could reduce the maximum heat flux effectively, but it also degrades the aerodynamic performances. When the blunt radius increases, the aerodynamic performance degrades significantly, while the heat flux wears off. With a fixed blunt radius, the aerodynamic performance mainly depends on the angle of attack; while the heat flux is less affected by the angle of attack. When designing waverider, the influence of bluntness on aerodynamic force and heat flux should be considered synthetically and the optimal balance point needs to be determined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical simulation on the responses of slopes and the initiation of debris flow under rainfall was processed by using the software FLAC2D based on the soil parameters in Weijia Gully, Beichuan County, Sichuan Province, China. The effects of the slope angle, rainfall intensity, soil parameters on the developments of the stress and pore pressure and deformation of the slope were studied. It indicates that large displacements of the slope are mainly located near the slope toe. With the increase of the rainfall intensity the stability of the slope decreases and so the debris-flow is easy to occur. © 2011 Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

81455135204	Two-dimensional numerical model for debris flows in the Jiangjia Gully, Yunnan Province	Debris flows are recurrent natural hazards in many mountainous regions. This paper presents a numerical study on the propagation of debris flows in natural erodible open channels, in which the bed erosion and sedimentation processes are important. Based on the Bingham fluid theory, a mathematical model of the two-dimensional non-constant debris flow is developed. The governing equations include the continuity and momentum conservation equations of debris flow, the sediment convection-diffusion equation, the bed erosion-deposition equation and the bed-sediment size gradation adjustment equation. The yield stress and shear stress components are included to describe the dynamic rheological properties. The upwind control-volume Finite Volume Method (FVM) is applied to discretize the convection terms. The improved SIMPLE algorithm with velocity-free-surface coupled correction is developed to solve the equations on non-orthogonal, quadrilateral grids. The model is applied to simulate a debris flow event in Jiangjia Gully, Yunnan Province and to predict the flow pattern and bed erosion-deposition processes. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed numercial model in debris flow simulation and potential hazard analysis. © Science Press and Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

83255170569	Experimental study of regulating barrage and transportation properties of debris flow by silt-trap dam	Silt-trap dam is an important debris flow preventive measure with a large cubage. According to the forms and circs of the dams summarized and a new notion of the system collocating optimization, the experiment on regulating properties of debris flow by the silt-trap dam has been performed. In the experiment, bulk density, gross and the rate of the drainage hole are changed to analyze the property variation law of debris flow. The experimental results show that: (1) The gradient of intercepted sediments increases with the increase of bulk density and gross of debris flow, and the decrease of rate of drainage hole. The bulk density is smaller, the effects of the gross and rate of drainage hole on the gradient are larger. (2) When the gross of the debris flow is less than the cubage, the value of the flux changing with a drainage hole rate 2.2% is twice to that with a rate 6.6%. (3) Under the same over-current of the drainage hole mode, the former bulk density gets a square formula relation with its ratio to the latter. With the formula, we find that when the bulk density is 1.567 kN/m

84860012337	Fracture of a slope by percolating	A theoretical analysis based on a pseudo-three-phase media is presented, and the instability of a slope causing the debris flow is studied. The occurrence of fractures (or water films) in saturated soils in two cases is analyzed. The first case is that the water is forced to percolate through the soil upwards. A perturbation method is used in this case to obtain an approximate solution to explain the formation mechanism of cracks. The second case is about the cracks in liquefied soils. Numerical analysis and theoretical analysis are processed for this case. The formation of fractures in saturated grain accumulation under gravity is due to the blocking by redeposit of finer grains. The formation of fractures presents a sliding surface for landslides and debris flow. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

84863032592	Evolution of shear zones using numerical analysis at the May 12th Wenchuan Earthquake Site, China	Landslides and collapses occurred during the May 12th earthquake in Wenchuan County. Most of these landslides and collapses were caused by shear bands. Shear band triggers instability on mountain slopes, resulting in debris flow, landslides, or collapse. According to experimental results, there was only one shear band forming in the soil layer prior to the initiation of debris flow under shear load, although several fine shear bands appeared. The development of shear bands in saturated soils is numerically investigated in this paper using the in situ soil from the Weijia Gully, Beichuan County. The evolution of shear banding from several finite amplitude disturbances (FADs) in pore pressure has been studied. The numerical analysis revealed that the FADs evolved into a fully developed shear band. It is shown that the shear banding process consists of two stages: inhomogeneous shearing and true shear banding. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84863143604	Modeling and rendering of real-time large-scale granular flow scene on GPU	Real-time large-scale granular flow scene simulation has become a challenging task because massive amounts of geometric and graphical computation need to be rapidly processed. The paper presents a new simulation method that compute Discrete Element Method (DEM) entirely on GPU. To achieve this goal, Spatial subdivision algorithm is firstly proposed to partition space into a uniform grid, we also propose parallel radix sort algorithm and then sort the particles based on their hash values. With the above methods, we can effectively increase speed for searching neighboring particles and interacting with boundaries. To reach the requirement of real-time simulation of large-scale granular flow based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM), the implementation is made with the NVIDIA Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The experimental results show that the method proposed not only can simulate large-scale granular flow scene in real-time, but can simulate various kinds of granular flow behaviors in real-time by adjusting the very few experimental parameters. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84864094588	The numerical study of cone-derived waverider with nonuniform blunt radius	The sharp leading edge of cone-derived waverider has to be blunted because of the serious aero-heating. Waverider's lift-to-drag ratio would decrease badly if the configuration is blunted with a uniform radius. The key problem is how to balance the aerodynamic performance of this configuration and the aero-heating along its leading edge. In this paper, the concept of nonuniform blunt leading edge is proposed to deal with this confliction. The numerical study indicated that the aerodynamic performance of waverider with nonuniform blunt leading edge is better than the configuration with uniform blunt radius, and the aero-heating on this configuration can meet the need of temperature protection as well. It is a candidate method of waverider to blunt the leading edge with nonuniform radius for practical usage.

84865183788	Preliminary study on debris-flow drainage channel with staggered indented-sill	Drainage channel, one of the most common debris-flow countermeasures, becomes more and more significant in debris-flow control. A new type of debris-flow channel, namely drainage cannel with indented sill (DCIS) , which consists of two-side wall and some indented sill between them, is proposed herein. This type of drainage channel can be classified into three categories according to the flow area and the longitudinal gradient of the channel. This paper analyzed the structural characteristics of the DCIS and the movement mode of debris-flow in DCIS, compared the mechanism of energy dissipation, failure mode and ecological effect, etc. with those of the Dongchuan-type drainage channel. The analyses show that the DCIS has obvious advantages over the Dongchuan-type drainage channel. The research findings could give a reference to further exploration of DCIS.

84864506452	Discrete numerical modeling of particle transport in granular filters	Granular filters are an essential component in earth dams to protect the dam core from seepage erosion. This paper uses the particle flow method (PFM) to study the mechanism of particle transport in a base soil-filter system. The distributions of the eroded base-soil particles in different filters are traced and analyzed. The eroded mass and intruding depth of the eroded particles into the filters are obtained under different times and hydraulic gradients. The simulation results show that the eroded mass and intruding depth of the base-soil particles into the filter are related to the representative particle size ratio of the base soil to the filter, hydraulic gradient and erosion time. The numerical predictions are also compared with the empirical filter design criterion. The results show that the particle flow model provides an effective approach for studying the filtration micro-property and the erosion mechanism in a base soil-filter system, which is useful for filter design. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

By taking the equilibrium gliding trajectory as the reference trajectory, it analyzed the relationship between turn radius, falling height, and bank angle. The analysis shows that when designing the guiding and control command, the flight conditions and the limitation of the control ability need to be considered. Then the dynamics were separated into fast and slow variables in terms of singular perturbation theory. Furthermore, the trajectory linearization control (TLC) method was applied to design the control system.

We presented a method based on rough set theory integrated with improved artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA) for fault diagnosis of transformer. Firstly, the values of dissolved gas analysis (DGA) in oil were taken as conditional attributes and the type faults were taken as decision attributes. Various relations between fault and symptom were connected, and decision table was established. Then, the improved artificial fish swarm algorithm was used to discrete continuous attribute, and the rough set theory was used to reduce the decision table. Finally, the simplified decision rules were got, which greatly simplified the difficulty of diagnosis. The experimental results indicate that the method increases the diagnosis accuracy compared with the traditional algorithm.

The disturbed soil may easily cause erosion, collapse, landslide and other disasters. This paper studies the stress-strain relationship and strength of remolded soil through variables of confining pressure, shear rates, and consolidation time. The change of shear strength was discussed under different experimental conditions, and shearing process and deformation shapes were analyzed. The results show that stress-strain curves present strain-hardening phenomenon, and the confining pressure is the most influential among the va-riables. For the remolded soil, the cohesion is 20.99KPa and friction angle is 22.7°. When the soil strain reaches to 20%, there is no obvious failure surface, but only radial barrel deformation and well-balanced out-side form.

84867188303	Monitoring of landslides and debris flows using FBG sensing technology	Landslide is a typical geological hazard occurring in mountainous regions. Debris flows will be induced by heavy rainfall. But it is too difficult to predict debris flow and landside by traditional numerical methods. Thus instrumentation and warning methods are of great importance. Traditional technologies which based on electric sensing technique have certain limitations. The optical fiber sensors introduced in this paper can overcome those limitations. This paper presents two new optical fiber sensor systems: one is the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) based in-place inclinometer for monitoring landslide movements and the other is the FBG based column-net system for monitoring debris flows. This paper presents the calibration results of FBG based in-place inclinometers in laboratory. It is found that the calibration results are in good agreement with theoretical results. Both the FBG based in-place inclinometers and the FBG based column-net system have been installed at a site in Weijiaogao, Beichuan, Sichuan Province of China.

84867595937	Experimental and numerical study on the aero-heating characteristics of blunted waverider	Aero-heating analysis is very important for the thermal protection system design of blunted waverider. In this paper, the heat flux distributions on the nose region and leading edge, the upper surface and the lower surface are studied with numerical and experiment methods, including the effects of attack angle and sideslip angle. The results show that high heat flux is limited in a small region around the stagnation point, and the influence of attack angle on the aero-heating of nose region can be neglected. Because even small sideslip angle may induce great enhanced aero-heating on the windward side of blunted waverider, zero degree sideslip angle is suggested in the present paper. With this assumption, the thermal materials of nose region, leading edge and upper surface can be chosen based on their aero-heating under on-design condition; while for the lower surface, the thermal materials should be determined by the aero-heating under maximum angle of attack. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84875634181	New control methods for large debris flows in Wenchuan earthquake area	The Wenchuan earthquake has induced a great mass of collapse and landslide in the Longmen Mountain area, leading to the occurrence of extra-large scale debris flows. Through analyzing the failure reasons of two typical debris flow prevention engineerings, the main reason was that the stone masonry structure, which has been widely applied currently, has weak availability of resistance from debris flow. In order to resist the damaging of extra-large scale debris flows, new engineering structures were proposed for preventing debris flow, such as combination of check dam and drainage canal. The details of these new structures were check dam with the type of reinforced concrete frame + stone masonry dam body and prefabricated reinforced concrete cube boxes, drainage canal with the type of compound section and prefabricated reinforced concrete cube boxes. These new structures can improve the resistant abilities of check dams, decrease construction cycle, protect eco-environment of drainage area and make full use of existing materials in the gully without increasing investment. This new technology proposed can effectively control the extra-large scale debris flow in the Longmen Mountain area.

To visualize the process, the rock avalanche model based on discrete element method (DEM) was established and debris dam and drainage canal were constructed in 3D scene, then the boundary conditions of them was processed. To simulate large-scale rock avalanche in real time, the high parallelism and programmability of GPU is fully taken advantage of.

84876559876	Mechanism of cross-feed action between check dam structure and upper shallow landslide	Check dam engineering is usually arranged in channel of deformation zones of debris flow. And it plays a role of retaining sediment, raising erosive base, slowdown slope of gully bed and stabilizing slope and fixing bed. Combined limit equilibrium method, the mechanism of cross-feed action between check dam and debris flow, upper shallow landslide is discussed in this paper. The influence of different trapped sediment thickness, the erosion of debris flow to slope toe and different height of water storage after dam on upper shallow landslide is calculated and analyzed. Stability of landslide at different location in the direction of trapped sediment is briefly described. The results show as follows. The trapped sediment after dam can stabilize slope, but the influence on increasing stability is little. On the other hand, slope mass sheared and shear opening elevation decrease landslide scale, and to some extent decrease the sediment source of debris flow. 2The most dangerous slip surface has great changes after water storage. The shear opening gradually reduces from slope surface to water level below. This leads to landslide scale increase and further increase sediment source in the debris flow gully. So the occurring scale of debris flow increases. 3The location of landslide is different in the direction of trapped sediment, gully erosion and trapped sediment thickness have different response to it. The nearer to check dam, the bigger trapped sediment, and the better landslide stability. Inversely, the farther away from it, the bigger possibility of erosion is, and the weaker stability. © 2013 IEEE.

84879159960	Secondary mountain disasters induced by the 4·20 Lushan earthquake and disaster mitigation	Extraordinary earthquake disasters were caused by the 4·20 Lushan Earthquake, and meanwhile a great number of secondary mountain disasters whose main types include collapse, landslide, rolling stone, rockfalls, dammed lakes, debris flow, etc. had been induced by the earthquake. Not merely did these secondary disasters result in heavy casualties but also blocked road for rescue service, which retarded the relieving progress. Large quantities of collapses and landslides induced by the earthquake supplied debris flow with abundant material sources which is a big stimulus for yielding catastrophic debris flow hazards under heavy rain in the later days. Through preliminary analysis, the strategies for hazard mitigation were given, which included emergency investigation, monitoring and warning, risk assessment of temporary shelters, and protection countermeasure of provincial 210 line; strategies for hazard mitigation in the restoration and reconstruction after disasters were also proposed, which involved improving self-protection ability of the towns in mountains, reinforcing self-protection ability of village settlements, reinforcing monitoring and warning system in mountain hazards, the disasters mitigation in road rebuilt and reinforcing prevention of float timber disaster in watershed.

84879178375	Layout methods of control works preventing large scale debris flows in Wenchuan earthquake area	Debris flows were more active in four years after the Wenchuan earthquake and there were several extra-large occurrences. This paper proposed three types of initiation mechanism of debris flow: burst-style on gentle slope, erosion-style on moderate slope, and soil liquefaction-style on steep slope. Effect of dams on debris flow was also analyzed. The results indicats that the large debris flow would block the mainstream river and the boulders transported into the river might increase the destructive power and the duration of blockage. The dam formed by debris flow would aggravate the disaster in the upstream. Series of layout methods have been proposed based on the formation mechanism of debris flow and its disaster: a layout method of control works preventing debris flow to avoid blocking the main river; the groups of slit-trap dams with different openings in different grades; the groups of check dams stabilizing source soil; and the step-pool architecture formed by boulders in the gully bed. The control work system is designed on the basis of the transport capacity of the mainstream water flow, in which the discharge of debris flow drained by drainage channel is designed to be equal to the transport capacity of the river, and the discharge beyond is distributed to the dam system. Various engineering scientifically share the burden of debris flow. The combination of these methods is expected to modulate large scale debris flow effectively.

84880030360	Numerical and experimental study on waverider with blunt leading edge	Waverider is considered to be a good candidate for hypersonic flights, but due to the serious aero-heating and facture limitations, its infinite sharp leading edge should be blunted. In this paper, numerical method is used to study the flow characteristics of blunt waverider, including the mechanism of bluntness impact and the feasibility of nonuniform blunt method. An experiment has been done in FD-14A hypersonic shock wind tunnel to obtain the flow structure and heat flux distribution in the nose region of one waverider model. The results show that bluntness induces a detached bow shock around the nose region and spillage along the leading edge. As the blunt radius enlarges, the aerodynamic performance degrades remarkably. Fortunately, the severe aero-heating is limited in a small region around stagnation point for blunt waverider, and smaller blunt radius can be used for most of the leading edge. Owing to the improvement of aerodynamic performance and negligible influence on thermal protection system, the concept of "nonuniform blunt method" is proved to be feasible for hypersonic waverider design. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84905394957	Activity and distribution of geohazards induced by the Lushan earthquake, April 20, 2013	An Ms7.0 earthquake, focal depth 13 km, struck Lushan on April 20, 2013, caused 196 deaths and 21 missing, 13,484 injuries, and affected more than two million people. A field investigation was taken immediately after the quake, and the induced hazards were analyzed in comparison with the Wenchuan earthquake. We have identified 1,460 landslides and avalanches and four dammed lakes, which were generally small and concentrated on high elevation. Avalanches and rockfalls developed in cliffs and steep slopes of hard rocks, including Jinjixia of Baosheng Town and Dayanxia of Shuangshi Town, Lushan, and the K317 section the Xiaoguanzi section north to Lingguan Town along the provincial highway S210. Landslides were relatively less, mainly in moderate and small scales, developing in sandstone, shale, and loose colluviums. Only one single large landslide was observed to turn into debris slide-flow. Dammed lakes were formed by avalanches and landslides, all in small size and of low danger degree. The earthquake-induced hazards distributed in belt on the hanging wall along the faults, and their major controlling factors include tectonics, lithology, structure surface, and landform. More than 99 % landslides were within 30 km to the epicenter, and 678 within 10 km, accounting for 46 % of the total; about 50 % landslides were distributed on slopes between 35° and 55°, and 11 % on slope exceeding 75°; 60 % on slopes at the altitudes between 1,000 and 1,500 m, 77 % on slopes between 900 and 1,500 m; and 24 and 62 % in hard rocks and section between hard and soft rocks, respectively. Compared with the case of Wenchuan earthquake, both the number and extension of landslides and avalanches in Lushan earthquake-affected area are much smaller, only 5.53 % in number and 0.57 % in area. The earthquake has increased the instability of slope and potentiality of landslide and debris flow. Accordingly, the active period is expected to be relatively short comparing with that in Wenchuan earthquake-hit area. However, the insidious and concealed hazards bring difficulty for risk investigation. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84912103379	Types and causes of debris flow damage to drainage channels in the Wenchuan earthquake area	Debris flows are among the most common geological disasters in China, and have been particularly frequent in Sichuan Province since the Wenchuan earthquake on 12 May 2008. The construction of debris flow drainage channels is a countermeasure used to distribute debris flow fans, and these channels play a critical role in the mitigation and prevention of damage resulting from debris flows. Under field conditions, the useful life of drainage channels can be greatly shortened as a result of strong abrasions to the drainage structure caused by the debris flow. Field investigations have shown that the types of damage to drainage channels include (a) erosion caused by hyper-concentrated silt flow, (b) impact fractures and foundation scour at the groundsills of the drainage channel, (c) destruction of the drainage channel outlet, and (d) destruction of the drainage channel caused by debris flow abrasion. In addition, based on the destruction of the drainage channel during the debris flow drainage process, a new type of drainage channel with energy dissipation components was proposed and applied in a steep, narrow gully for debris flow mitigation. Moreover, design and engineering repair recommendations for drainage channels are provided as a reference for repairing the damage to the channel. The results can provide an important reference for the effective repair and optimal design of drainage channels.

84919880998	Characteristics of a drainage channel with staggered indented sills for controlling debris flows	The characteristics of a new type of drainage channel with staggered indented sills for controlling debris flows were studied. The intermediate fluid in the non-viscous debris flow exhibited a helical movement, whereas the fluid near the sidewall had a stop-start movement pattern; the viscous debris flow exhibited a stable structure between the indented sills. The experimental results indicate that the mean velocity of the debris flow increased with increasing channel gradients, and the debris flow velocity was slightly affected by the angle of the sills. The average velocity of the non-viscous debris flow increased in the range of (0.5–1.5) interval between the indented sills, whereas the average velocity of the viscous debris flow increased initially and then decreased in the range of (0.75–1.25) interval between the indented sills. The depth of the non-viscous debris flow tended to gradually increase as the channel gradients increased, whereas the depth of the viscous debris flow gradually decreased as the channel gradients increased. When the discharge of the debris flow was constant, the angle and the interval between the indented sills had a slight effect on the depth of the viscous debris flow, whereas the depth of the non-viscous debris flow exhibited a different trend, as the sill angles and intervals were varied.
