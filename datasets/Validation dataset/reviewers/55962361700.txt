For a salable product, supply chain mode of VMI is established, which is based on deterministic demand, having initial stock and having stock-out cost. With the further analysis of the mode, VMI is found to increase profits of the buyer in the short-term motivation. But VMI will reduce profits of the supplier under the matching condition. And in the short-term motivation, VMI will increase the purchase price to compensate the transfer cost of the supplier. As a result, the foundation of theory is provided to implement VMI in the supply chain, and have some definituded project significance.

3042814903	The new pattern recognition method of traditional Chinese medicine based on HPLC	The new pattern recognition method of traditional Chinese medicine based on high performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) is presented. While a new self-organizing fuzzy neural network is also proposed in order to recognize the traditional Chinese medicine. This network is composed of two levels neural network: the first level is a self-organizing fuzzy neural network which has the automatic clustering structure for sub-class; the second level is supervised sub-class classification neural network. The whole network has not only the learning ability to neural network, but also the logic ability to fuzzy system based on rules, especially the automatic clustering ability to sub-class. The automatic clustering ability for sub-class has great meaning to the pattern recognition of traditional Chinese medicine because the traditional Chinese medicine will be very different under the condition of different place come from, different time picked up and different method dealt with. In addition, the whole network can also adapt to the fuzzy pattern recognition problem when the feature dimensions are not equal. The traditional Chinese medicine samples have been used to test the network's abilities. The results show that the resistance to parallel removal, deformation and the adaptability to the medicines coming from new places are very strong, thus the goals expected are achieved.

70350610613	Quantity discount policy based on trade credit for supply chain coordination	In a supply chain from a supplier to a retailer, the trade credit the former offered to the latter is possible to affect individually their target profit hence the total profit of the supply chain. To solve the problem, the total income from the supply chain should be shared rationally between the supplier and retailer, thus developing a contractual coordination model for quantity discount based on trade credit in random demand. Analyzing the effect of quantity discount policy on income sharing and coordination on the basis of a certain trade credit, the optimal contractual parameters are deduced to realize the coordination of the whole supply chain. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the correctness of the conclusion drawn from the coordination model and relevant analysis.

0035304690	Fuzzy optimization of securities combination	On the basis of two securities selection, the fuzzy concept was applied to the portfolio composition selection. According to the hope, object and permitting difference given by investor, the membership was taken as object function. The models of the linear membership function and the non-linear membership function were discussed. When the membership function takes value between [0, 1], the solution of two models has no big difference and reflects, the satisfactory degree of the customer. The parameter of the non-linear membership function corresponds to fuzzy scale of the investor's profit rate and the risk. These values are smaller and the fuzzy scale is smaller compared with the linear membership function. It is well shown that the investor takes the value intention for the object value. For the data of ten stock profit rate in Shen Zhen stock market, the evolution programming is adopted to wage the optimization calculation and to verify the effectiveness of the model.

78651483888	The supply chain robust coordination strategy based on data-driven approach	The robust coordination of a two-stage supply chain with a risk-averse retailer and a risk-neutral supplier is studied under the condition of only knowing historical demand observation data. An objective function based on conditional value at risk is developed with respect to the risk-averse retailer, and the corresponding coordination mechanism for supply chain is designed with only knowing historical data of demand. A data-driven approach is applied to derive the robust coordination strategy. At last, a numerical calculation is done to verify the effectiveness of designed supply chain robust coordination strategy. The results show that data-driven approach can effectively cope with the supply chain risk deriving form demand uncertainty. Specially, when the distribution information of demand can be known, the supply chain robust coordination strategy based on data-driven can decrease risk-averse retailer's revenue, and to this at the same time it will increase supplier's revenue. However, the yield gap of whole supply chain system will be insignificant, which shows the effectiveness of datadriven approach in accounting for demand uncertainty. ©2010 IEEE.

0345868309	Research on the fractal structure in the Chinese stock market	Applying fractal theory, this paper probes and discusses self-similarity and scale invariance of the Chinese stock market. It analyses three kinds of scale indexes, i.e., autocorrelation index, Hurst index and the scale index on the basis of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) algorithm and promotes DFA into a recursive algorithm. Using the three kinds of scale indexes, we conduct empirical research on the Chinese Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The results indicate that the rate of returns of the two stock markets does not obey the normal distribution. A correlation exists between the stock price indexes over time scales. The stock price indexes exhibit fractal time series. It indicates that the policy guide hidden at the back influences the characteristic of the Chinese stock market. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.
