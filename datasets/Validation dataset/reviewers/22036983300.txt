8644235831	Potential usage of liposome-encapsulated phosphor for in vivo imaging of tissue oxygenation	Oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence can provide a quantitative measurement with high temporal resolution of tissue oxygenation in vivo. It is a real-time optical means for prognosis of diseases where the oxygen concentration is essential. Phosphorescence quenching is a non-invasive methodology, otherwise no more than minimally invasive as the phosphor is necessarily introduced into vasculature prior to the measurement. Oxyphor R2, a dendritic phosphor with two-layer of glutamates, is a suitable phosphor for oxygen measurements owing to its high water solubility. We used a frequency-domain, phase modulation based instrument to calibrate Oxyphor R2. The acquired quenching constant (k

21844479034	In vivo monitoring of nanosphere on-site delivery using fiber-optic microprobe	To recognize the information of ischemia-induced blood vessel permeability would be valuable to formulate the drugs for optimal local delivery, we constructed an implantable needle type fiber-optic microprobe for the monitoring of in vivo fluorescent substances in anesthetized rats. This fiber-optic microprobe was composed of coaxial optical fibers and catheterized using a thin wall tubing of stainless steel (∼400 μm O.D. and ∼300 μm I.D.). The central fiber, with 100 μm core diameter and 20 μm cladding, coated with a 30 μm layer of gold, was surrounded by 10 fibers with 50 μm cores. The central fiber carried the light from the 488 nm Argon laser to the tissue while the surrounding fibers collected the emitted fluorescence to the detector. When the fiber-optic microprobe was placed in the solutions containing various concentrations of fluorescent nanospheres (20 nm), either with or without 10% lipofundin as optical phantom, nanosphere concentration-dependent responses of the fluorescence intensity were observed. The microprobe was then implanted into the liver and the brain of anesthetized rats to monitor the in situ extravasation of pre-administered fluorescent nanospheres from vasculature following the ischemic insults. Both the hepatic and cerebral ischemic insults showed immediate increases of the extracellular 20 nm fluorescent nanospheres. The implantable fiber-optic microprobe constructed in present study provides itself as a minimally-invasive technique capable of investigating the vascular permeability for in vivo nanosphere delivery in both ischemic liver and brain.

0029941948	The dorsal facial area of the medulla in cats: Inhibitory action of serotonin on glutamate release in regulating common carotid blood flow	Whether glutamate and serotonin would release and interact in the dorsal facial area (DFA) of cat medulla to regulate common carotid arterial (CCA) blood flow was explored by placing a microdialysis probe in DFA and employing high performance liquid chromatographic technique. Glutamate concentration was dose-dependently decreased by perfusion with serotonin, or alaproclate, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Serotonin and glutamate concentrations were increased by perfusion with KCl, a depolarizing agent. Furthermore, CCA blood flow was decreased when glutamate concentration was reduced by serotonin or alaproclate perfusion, and conversely increased when glutamate concentration was increased by KCl perfusion. In conclusion, glutamate and serotonin releases in DFA that involve regulation of CCA blood flow are tonically mediated by nerve terminals. The glutamate release is depressed by the serotonin release.

0030058865	In vivo evidence of hydroxyl radical formation induced by elevation of extracellular glutamate after cerebral ishcemia in the cortex of anesthetized rats	The in vivo interrelation between excitotoxicity and oxidative stress following cerebral ischemia in the cortex of anesthetized rats was investigated. Cerebral ischemia was induced by ligation of the bilateral common carotid arteries and the unilateral middle cerebral artery. Microdialysis perfusion with on-line high-performance liquid chromatography was used to monitor the hydroxyl radical levels. Extracellular hydroxyl radical levels were quantitated as the increased formation of 2.3 and 2.5 dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), the hydroxylative products of salicylic acid contained in the microdialysis perfusion solutions. Elevated cortex extracellular glutamate content, resulting from the cerebral ischemia, caused an increase in the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Exogenous perfusion of authentic glutamate solutions through implanted microdialysis probes also resulted in increased hydroxyl radical formation in the cortex. The 2.3 and 2.5 DHBA levels remained elevated for an entire 80-min ischemic period. These results suggest that, after cerebral ischemia, increased oxidative stress did occur in anesthetized rats, and the oxidative stress may result from increased excitotoxicity.

0010513817	Effect of acute skin thermal injury on subcutaneous glutathione, ascorbic acid and hydroxyl radical concentrations in anesthetized rats	The effect of acute thermal injury on subcutaneous oxidative stress, in anesthetized rats, was evaluated. A microdialysis probe was implanted in the subcutaneous tissue for continuous sampling of interstitial fluids, and the microdialysates were injected onto either an on-line or an off-line high performance liquid chromatography system. Hydroxyl radicals, glutathione, and ascorbic acid concentrations in the microdialysates were analyzed. Acute thermal injury was induced by skin contact of a hot (90°C) iron bar for 30 or 15 s. Subcutaneous hydroxyl radical production, represented as the increased formation of 2,3 and 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA), did not increase significantly after thermal contact. Interestingly, both ascorbic acid and glutathione, two major physiological antioxidants, were significantly elevated in the subcutaneous interstitial fluids immediately after thermal contacts. The elevated subcutaneous glutathione levels rapidly decreased and returned to basal values 60 min after thermal contact. Ascorbic acid concentrations did not fully return to basal values even 3 h after thermal contact. The increase in ascorbic acid and glutathione may be responsible for scavenging of hydroxyl radicals that may form following thermal injury. © Pearson Professional Ltd 1996.

0029806201	Supplementation with vitamins C and E enhances cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in healthy adults	The effect of supplementation with vitamins C and E on cytokine production of healthy adult volunteers was studied in a single-blind trial. Ten subjects in each group received daily vitamin C (1 g ascorbic acid), vitamin E (400 mg dl-α-tocopheryl acetate), or vitamins C and E for 28 d. Plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol, ascorbate, and lipid peroxides as well as the production of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured before, during, and at the end of the supplementation and 1 wk later. PBMCs were cultured in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide for 24 h. The interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the culture supernates were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. Production of IL-1β and TNF- α in the group supplemented with vitamins C and E was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the groups given vitamin E or vitamin C alone. The enhancing effect of supplementation with a combination of vitamins E and C coincided with peak plasma α-tocopherol and ascorbate concentrations and the lowest plasma lipid peroxide concentrations (P < 0.05) on day 14. In addition, an in vitro experiment with PBMCs showed that vitamins E and C reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E

0030580962	New dual electrochemical detector for microbore liquid chromatography. Determination of dopamine and serotonin in rat striatum dialysates	A new type of liquid chromatographic (LC) dual thin-layer amperometric detector for the simultaneous measurement of trace levels of dopamine and serotonin in microdialysates is described. The concentrations of these analytes in rat dialysates are usually in the sub-nanomolar concentration range (typically, 0.10-5.00 pg id 5-μl dialysates). With this dual electrode, a glass-lined microbore column provides excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and separation. In addition, a three- to five-fold improvement in anodic current or cathodic responses over conventional dual electrodes in microbore LC can be achieved. Due to the irreversible electrochemical properties of some interference peaks, this dual electrode provides reliable measurement of dopamine based on the cathodic signal. The detection limit (signal-to-noise ratio = 3) of this assay is 0.02 pg per injection for dopamine or serotonin. This new dual electrode allows the simultaneous measurements of basal dopamine and serotonin in rat striatum dialysates without the use of re-uptake inhibitors in perfusion medium.

0030588984	In vivo, continuous and automatic monitoring of extracellular ascorbic acid by microdialysis and on-line liquid chromatography	A system for in vivo, automatic, continuous monitoring of organ extracellular ascorbic acid in anesthetized rat is described. This system involves microdialysis perfusion and a LC system equipped with an electrochemical detector. Microdialysate, eluted from a microdialysis probe implanted in the brain cortex or in the left ventricular myocardium of anesthetized rats was collected in the sample loop of an on-line injector for direct injection onto the LC system. This automated method provides a shortened sample processing time. This system was utilized to investigate the effect of cerebral ischemia on cortex extracellular ascorbic acid and the effect of myocardial ischemia on left ventricular myocardium extracellular ascorbic acid in anesthetized rats. Basal ascorbic acid concentrations in the cortex and left ventricular myocardium ranged from 9.7 to 15.4 μM (mean ± S.D., 12.7 ± 2.5 μM from the results of eight rats) and from 9.3 to 36.0. μM (mean ± S.D., 24.3 ± 8.9 μM from the results of twelve rats), respectively. Cerebral ischemia significantly elevated ascorbic acid levels in the cortex extracellular space, while myocardial ischemia did not significantly alter ascorbic acid levels in the left ventricular myocardium extracellular space.

0030694485	Intracellular glutathione content of urothelial cancer in correlation to chemotherapy response	We evaluated the possible correlation between intracellular glutathione (GSH) and drug sensitivity of urothelial cancer. Tissue GSH content of surgical specimens from 20 patients with urothelial cancer was assayed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). GSH levels of cancer tissue (7.887 ± 6.176 μM/mg protein) were significantly higher than GSH levels of normal mucosa (1.345 ± 1.252 μM/mg). All patients having measurable lesions were then treated with methotrexate, epirubicin and cisplatin (MEC). These patients were classified into three groups according to clinical response criteria. GSH content in cancer tissue from four patients with complete response was 0.804 ± 1.183 μM/mg protein. However, the cancer cells from patients with partial response and non-response contained a significantly higher level of GSH (6.295 ± 2.459 (n = 8) and 12.955 ± 6.141 μM/mg protein (n = 8), respectively). Intracellular glutathione content may play an important role in intrinsic resistance of urothelial cancer to MEC chemotherapy. It might be potentially used to predict drug sensitivity in urothelial cancer patients before starting chemotherapy.

0030920315	Evaluation of extracellular lipid peroxidation in brain cortex of anaesthetized rats by microdialysis perfusion and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection	A method for in vivo evaluation of lipid peroxidation in the extracellular space of anaesthetized rat brain cortex was developed. This method involved the use of microdialysis perfusion and high-performance liquid chromatography. The microdialysates, eluted from implanted probes, were reacted with thiobarbituric acid (TEA) prior to analysis by an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector (excitation and emission wavelengths were 515 and 550 nm, respectively). Lipid peroxidation in the extracellular space was evaluated as the concentration of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation end product which reacts with TEA to form a fluorescent conjugate. Significantly increased production of malondialdehyde following hydrogen peroxide perfusion (0.03%, 0.3% at a flow-rate of 1 μl/min) was observed in the brain cortex of anaesthetized rats.

0031058027	Effect of diethylmaleate on liver extracellular glutathione levels before and after global liver ischemia in anesthetized rats	Glutathione (GSH), present in a high concentration in the liver, serves important protective functions. We investigated the effect of lowered tissue GSH content, accomplished by diethylmaleate (DEM) administration, on liver extracellular GSH levels before and after global ischemia in anesthetized rats. Liver extracellular GSH levels were determined by microdialysis perfusion and an on-line high performance liquid chromatography system. Global liver ischemia was induced by ligation of the hepatic pedicles including the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct. DEM (4 mmol/kg) significantly lowered both the liver tissue GSH levels (1.36 ± 0.26 μmol/g wet wt vs 9.50 ± 0.55 μmol/g wet wt for the untreated) and the liver extracellular GSH levels (4.3 ± 2.4 μM vs 25.2 ± 8.7 μM for the untreated). Global liver ischemia induced a dramatic increase in the liver extracellular GSH level. Although the liver tissue GSH level was lowered following DEM treatment, DEM administration did not affect significantly ischemia-induced elevation of extracellular GSH (when presented as fold increase relative to basal value). In conclusion, DEM showed a direct effect on liver extracellular GSH content in anesthetized rats. However, DEM treatment did not affect the relative release of GSH following global liver ischemia.

0031677638	Simultaneous measurement of ascorbic acid and glutathione: Application of microdialysis and on-line HPLC with Au/Hg electrode in anesthetized rat liver	An assay for simultaneous measurement of glutathione and ascorbic acid, two mutually related important aqueous antioxidants in the biological matrix, is reported. This assay involved an HPLC system equipped with an electrochemical detector and Au/Hg electrode. A microdialysis perfusion system was coupled with this LC-ECD system for on-line and continuous determination of glutathione and ascorbic acid levels in extracellular fluids of anesthetized rat liver. Good reproducibility for both ascorbic acid and glutathione was achieved when standard glutathione and ascorbic acid solutions were used. Additionally, the effects of global liver ischemia on the hepatic extracellular ascorbic acid and glutathione levels were investigated. The simultaneous monitoring of ascorbic acid and glutathione levels is important since glutathione and ascorbic acid are mutually related in many biological functions.

0031350035	Increased formation of interstitial hydroxyl radical following myocardial ischemia: Possible relationship to endogenous opioid peptides	The effects of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion on interstitial hydroxyl radical production, in the left ventricular myocardium of anesthetized cats, were investigated. Ringer's solution containing salicylic acid was perfused through an implanted microdialysis probe. Hydroxyl radical production was evaluated as the 2,3 and 2,5 dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) concentrations in the microdialysates by an on-line high performance liquid chromatography system. Myocardial ischemia for 60 min, induced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, significantly increased both 2,3 and 2,5 DHBA levels when compared with the sham-operated cats. Naloxone (1 mg/kg, bolus, intravenous), an endogenous opioid peptide receptor antagonist, significantly suppressed the ischemia-induced production of hydroxyl radicals. Myocardial ischemia also induced cardiac arrhythmia. Naloxone reduced the severity of ischemia-induced arrhythmia, as observed by a significantly lower arrhythmia score (1.4 ± 0.2 vs. 4.6 ± 0.4 for control), and by diminished incidence of ventricular tachycardia (0/7 vs. 8/8 for control) and ventricular fibrillation (0/7 vs. 3/8 for control). Furthermore, perfusion of dynorphin (0.25 μg, 2.5 μg and 25 μg), an endogenous opioid peptide receptor agonist, increased hydroxyl radical production. Our results suggest that, in anesthetized cats, myocardial ischemia can induce production of interstitial hydroxyl radical in left ventricular myocardium, and this production may involve the actions of released endogenous opioid peptides on their receptors.

0031776626	Comparison of the ascorbic acid levels between human milk and infant formula during storage process	Effects of storage temperature and time on the ascorbic acid levels in human milk were studied using an HPLC system equipped with an electrochemical detector. The results were also compared to those obtained from commercial infant formula. The ascorbic acid levels in human milk was found to change from 65 ± 7% remaining, to 42 ± 8%, 12 ± 6% and the 3 ± 2% after stored at 4 °C for 1, 2, 7 and 30 days respectively. However, -18 °C storage can prevent the loss of ascorbic acid levels effectively, as evidenced by high ascorbic acid level remaining (83 ± 8%) after 30 days storage. Similar trend was observed in commercial infant formula. The ascorbic acid level remaining in commercial infant formula was found to be 1 ± 0.2% and 63 ± 6% after 30 days storage at 4 °C and -18 °C respectively. These results suggested that in terms of preserving ascorbic acid level, human milk was better than infant formula and frozen storage was better than refrigeration.

0031887613	Elevated extracellular glutamate concentrations increased malondialdehyde production in anesthetized rat brain cortex	Oxidative stress is believed to be involved in the damaging mechanism of excitotoxic insult. Thus, we investigated the effect of elevated extracellular glutamate levels on malondialdehyde production, a common index of lipid peroxidation, in anesthetized rat brain cortex. Elevation of extracellular glutamate levels was achieved either by exogenously perfusing glutamate solutions, or by perfusing L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC), a competitive inhibitor of glutamate uptake transporter, through an implanted microdialysis probe. Malondialdehyde levels in the microdialysates, which were reacted with thiobarbituric acid, were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a fluorescence detector. Perfusion of glutamate (1.5 and 15 mM) resulted in dose-dependent increases in extracellular malondialdehyde production (as high as a 6-fold increase in malondialdehyde production following perfusion of 15 mM glutamate solution). PDC (3.14 and 31.4 mM), not only significantly increased the extracellular glutamate levels in a dose-dependent manner, but also dramatically increased malondialdehyde production (as high as 20-fold increase). These results suggest that excitotoxicity induces oxidative stress in anesthetized rat brain cortex, as evidenced by the glutamate-induced increase in malondialdehyde production.

0031909194	Content of reduced glutathione and consequences in recipients of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient red blood cells	The red blood cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity of every donor was examined with automatic enzyme-coupled method. The technique of molecular biology was applied to determine the DNA mutations for the 97 donors with undetectable G6PD activity. The concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the stored RBC of the 97 G6PD-deficient donors and 124 normal donors was determined with the technique of high performance liquid chromatography. Routine blood counts, bilirubin and haptoglobin levels were used to evaluate posttransfusional hemolysis for the 48 adult patients transfused with 1 U G6PD deficient and 1 U normal RBC. Most (88, 90.7%) of the 97 donors were confirmed to be G6PD deficient at the DNA level. At each age interval of storage, the GSH concentration of G6PD-deficient RBC was significantly different from that of normal RBC. The total average value of GSH (μmol/gHb) was 2.52 ± 0.95 (mean ± 1 standard deviation) vs. 3.74 ± 1.43 (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin, hematocrit, bilirubin, and haptoglobin levels in the patients receiving G6PD-deficient RBC were not statistically different from those in the recipients of normal RBC; even though the age of stored blood was 26-35 days. Within the same group of patients, the results of bilirubin and haptoglobin were not significantly changed before and after transfusion. The results of this study show that the GSH concentration in the stored blood of G6PD deficient donors was 67% of that in the normal donors. However, hemolysis does not occur in adult patients transfused with 1 U G6PD- deficient RBC. It seems unnecessary to screen G6PD activity for donors of adult recipients in Taiwan.

27744550811	Experimental spinal cord injury induced an increase of extracellular ascorbic acid concentration in anesthetized rats: A microdialysis study	Ascorbic acid plays important roles in mammalian central nervous system. We employed an on-line analytical system to monitor the extracellular ascorbic acid concentrations in anesthetized rat spinal cord before and after the experimental injury. A microdialysis probe (216 μm od, 200 μm id, 3 mm in length) was implanted into an anesthetized rat spinal cord (Thoratic-12). Microdialysis perfusate (2 μl/min) was collected in the sample loop (20 μl) of an on-line injector for direct injection onto a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with an electrochemical detector. Normal ascorbic acid concentrations in the spinal cord extracellular fluids ranged from 1.8 μM to 10.8 μM (mean ± S.D. 5.6 ± 2.4 μM, n = 8). The experimental spinal cord injury, induced by a lesion at T-10, gradually yet significantly increased the extracellular ascorbic acid levels. The effect of exogenous glutamate perfusion (0.2 mM, 2 mM, and 20 mM) through the microdialysis probe also increased the extracellular ascorbic acid concentrations in a dose dependent manner. These results suggested that the injury-induced ascorbic acid accumulation may result from elevated extracellular glutamate levels that are commonly observed in spinal cord injury. This on-line, continuous and automatic monitoring system can be applied to future investigations on the roles of ascorbic acid in spinal cord injuries. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33749187330	Inhibition of free radicals potentiates baroreflex sensitivity in hemorrhagic shock in rats	The effect of free radicals on baroreflex function during hemorrhagic shock was investigated in pentobarbital anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Hemorrhage was initiated by gradually (usually within 10 minutes) withdrawal of peripheral venous blood until the blood pressure reached 40-50 mmHg and a significant fall of heart rate was observed. Baroreflex sensitivity in the control of heart rate was determined with a linear regression method relating reflex bradycardias to phenylephrine-induced blood pressure changes. Hydroxyl radicals, trapped by salicylic acid to become 2,3-2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, were measured by HPLC methods. In the first part of the experiment, baroreflex sensitivity was depressed (-2.67 ±0.41 to -1.02 ±0.46 bpm/mmHg, p<0.05) and free radical concentrations in plasma was elevated (144 ±43 to 226 ±55 nM, p<0.05) during hemorrhage.

Prior tor electrophoretic separation, the non-fluorescent inositols and glucose were derivatized by N-methylisatoic anhydride at 25°C for 10 min so that they could be detected by a fluorescence detector during separation. The good separation with high efficiency by MEKC was achieved in 13 min with a glycine buffer containing SDS and PEG 4000. Several parameters affecting the separation were studied, including the PH of BGE, the concentrations of glycine, SDS, and PEG 4000, and the applied voltage. Using glycerol as an internal standard, the linear ranges of the method for myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, and glucose were 0.03-10, 0.01-5, and 0.05-20 mM; the concentration LODs of myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, and glucose were 0.020, 0.0078, and 0.026 mM, respectively. The method was applied to analyze extracellular myo-inositol and glucose in the microdialysates from rat brain cortex of ischemia animal model and intracellular myo-inositol and scyllo-inositol in the rat brain extract. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, we know little about their in vivo disposition and health consequences. Objectives: We assessed the tissue disposition and pharmacokinetics of QD705 in mice. Methods: We determined quantitatively the blood and tissue kinetics of QD705 in mice after single intravenous (iv) injection at the dose of 40 pmol for up to 28 days. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement of cadmium was the primary method of quantification of QD705. Fluorescence light microscopy revealed the localization of QD705 in tissues. Results: Plasma half-life of QD705 in mice was short (18.5 hr), but ICP-MS analyses revealed QD705 persisted and even continued to increase in the spleen, liver, and kidney 28 days after an iv dose. Considerable time-dependent redistribution from body mass to liver and kidney was apparent between 1 and 28 days postdosing. The recoveries at both time points were near 100%; all QD705s reside in the body. Neither fecal nor urinary excretion of QD705 was detected appreciably in 28 days postdosing. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated deposition of QD705 in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Conclusion: Judging from the continued increase in the liver (29-42% of the administered dose), kidney (1.5-9.2%), and spleen (4.8-5.2%) between 1 and 28 days without any appreciable excretion, QD705 has a very long half-life, potentially weeks or even months, in the body and its health consequences deserve serious consideration.

3542995683	Nanoparticle-based in vivo investigation on blood-brain barrier permeability following ischemia and reperfusion	The blood-brain barrier (BBB) represents a significant impediment to a large variety of central nervous system-active agents. In the current study, we applied fluorescent polystyrene nanospheres (20 nm) to study the BBB permeability following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. A microdialysis probe was implanted in the cerebral cortex of an anesthetized rat injected with fluorescent polystyrene nanospheres. The circulating nanospheres extravasating to the brain extracellular fluids were collected by the probe. Fluorescence intensity in the microdialysates throughout the course of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was measured. Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion induced transient accumulations of extracellular nanospheres in the brain. The accumulation of nanospheres may result from their extravasation from the blood vessels. The concurrent cerebral oxygen levels monitored using oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence decreased following ischemia and returned to their original levels after reperfusion. In conclusion, we demonstrated that high temporal resolution measurements of BBB permeability in vivo can be obtained using fluorescence polystyrene nanospheres and that these data correlate with changes of cerebral oxygen concentration. This present investigation indicates that nanoparticles have potential clinical applications involving drug delivery and determination of therapeutic efficacy and on-site diagnosis.

A microdialysis probe was implanted in the left ventricular interstitial space of anesthetized rat hearts. Myocardial ischemia was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Levels of 8-OH-dG in microdialysates were analyzed via an on-line high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with an electrochemical detector. The 8-OH-dG levels significantly increased (maximum 3.6-fold of increase relative to basal value) during the 60-min reperfusion stage following a 20 min ischemia. Administration of α-tocopherol acetate (20 mg/kg, intravenous, bolus) at 3 min prior to onset of reperfusion, significantly suppressed the reperfusion-induced increase in 8-OH-dG levels. These results suggested that one of the possible protective effect of α-tocopherol acetate was to reduce oxidative DNA damage during in myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Copyright (C) 1999.

0032855605	On-line derivatization for continuous and automatic monitoring of brain extracellular glutamate levels in anesthetized rats: A microdialysis study	Glutamate is an important excitatory amino acid in central nervous system. We developed a method for in vivo, continuous and automatic monitoring of brain extracellular glutamate, as well as other amino acids in anesthetized rat. This method involves the use of microdialysis perfusion technique and a high-performance liquid chromatography system equipped with a fluorescence detector. The microdialysate (perfused at a flow-rate of 1 μl/min) was on-line derivatized with o-phthaldehyde (perfused at 2 μl/min) through a mixing tee prior to the injection onto the HPLC column. The efficiency of this on-line derivatization was equivalent to that performed with an off-line manner. The effect of cerebral ischemia (2 h) and reperfusion (2 h) in brain cortex of anesthetized rats was monitored using this method. In addition to glutamate, extracellular concentrations of other amino acids, such as aspartate, glutamine, glycine, taurine and γ-aminobutyric acid, were also simultaneously monitored with this on-line method. Since monitoring of extracellular amino acids by microdialysis perfusion is intensively used in neuroscience investigations, this simple and convenient method would be useful in the future applications.

However, they either need particular microdevices or special surface treatment in local area, posing system fabrication/operation complexity. In this study, we employ simple and rapid surface plasma processes to create an asymmetry electroosmotic flow (EOF) in micro/nano channels. By this way, the sample can be concentrated into one side of the channel induced by the non-uniform zeta potential variation. We demonstrate that the concentrating ability for neurotransmitter (1μM Dopamine) in the modified asymmetry surface treated channel (500nm and 30 μ m channel depth) are 8.5 or 2.8 times larger than that in the channels with symmetrical surface treatment, respectively.

Trimethylammonium groups modified MSN (MSN-TA) with the average size of 50-100 nm was synthesized with incorporation of the TA groups into the framework of MSN. It was further adsorbed with indocyanine green (ICG) by electrostatic attraction to render MSN-TA-ICG as an efficient NIR contrast agent for in vivo optical imaging. The studies in stability of MSN-TA-ICG against pH indicated the bonding is stable over the range from acidic to physiological pH. The in vivo biodistribution of MSN-TA-ICG in anesthetized rat demonstrated a rather strong and stable fluorescence of MSN-TA-ICG that prominent in the organ of liver. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging and elemental analysis of silicon further manifested the physical and quantitative residences of MSN-TA-ICG in major organs. This is the first report of MSN function alized with NIR-ICG capable of optical imaging in vivo. © 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

58149469087	Role of ciliary neurotrophic factor in microglial phagocytosis	Microglia, CNS-resident macrophages, serve as scavengers to remove cellular debris and facilitate tissue remodeling in the developing and injured CNS. Little is known as what and how microenvironmental factors mediate the phagocytotic ability of microglia. Our previous study has indicated that treatment with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) increased the phagocytotic activity of primary rat microglia possibly through the upregulation of α5 integrin. In the present study, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which has been reported to be produced by glia, was shown to have stimulatory effect on the phagocytosis of primary rat microglia and mouse microglial cell line BV2.

0034663745	Determination of tissue α-tocopherol in senescence-accelerated mice by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection	α-Tocopherol (α-Toc) plays an important role in various distinct physiological functions. A convenient assay using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection (the excitation and emission wavelength was 296 and 340 nm, respectively) was developed for the accurate determination of the α-Toc in biological samples. Methanol (1/7; v/v) was used to extract α-Toc in tissue samples by precipitating the proteins. The assay obtained a recovery rate between 97.3 and 104.2% by adding pure α-Toc to mice liver homogenate. The R.S.D. for intra-day (n = 7) and inter-day (n = 6, three consecutive days) analysis was 0.7-2.8 and 0.5-3.7%, respectively. The effect of age on the α-Toc levels in the liver, brain and heart homogenates of senescence-accelerated mice (SAM) was also studied. The α-Toc levels in the tissue homogenates increased gradually with age for both male and female mice, while the female had higher α-Toc levels than the males of the same age.

0034733249	Diethylmaleate decreased ascorbic acid release induced by cerebral ischemia in cerebral cortex of the anesthetized rat	The effect of diethylmaleate administration on ascorbic acid release following cerebral ischemia was investigated in anesthetized rat brain cortex. Cerebral ischemia, induced by ligating bilateral common carotid arteries and unilateral middle cerebral artery, significantly increased the extracellular ascorbic acid levels. Diethylmaleate (4 mmoles/kg, i.p.), which has been shown in earlier studies to decrease the ischemia-induced glutamate release, significantly reduced the ischemia-induced ascorbic acid release. The ischemia-induced ascorbic acid release was unaffected by perfusing NMDA receptor antagonist MK 801 (75 μM). Additionally, elevated extracellular glutamate levels, achieved by either externally applied glutamate solutions or by perfusing L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC) (31.4 mM and 15.7 mM) to inhibit the glutamate uptake transporter, also significantly increased the extracellular ascorbic acid levels. These results suggested that ascorbic acid release in cerebral ischemia might be related to the elevated extracellular glutamate levels, which occurs following cerebral ischemia.

77954637738	Tri-functionalization of mesoporous silica nanoparticles for comprehensive cancer theranostics - The trio of imaging, targeting and therapy	In this work we report the development of the tri-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for use as theranostic compounds that orchestrate the trio of imaging, target and therapy in a single particle. The MSNs are functionalized in sequence with (1) contrast agents that enable traceable imaging of particle targeting, (2) drug payloads for therapeutic intervention and, (3) biomolecular ligands for highly-targeted particle delivery. Traceable imaging of nanoparticles was accomplished by directly incorporating a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent contrast agent, ATTO647N, into the silica framework of MSNs, to exploit the relative transparency of most tissues at NIR wavelengths and maximize MSN surface area available for the subsequent conjugating drugs and targeting ligands. An oxygen-sensing, palladium-porphyrin based photosensitizer (Pd-porphyrin; PdTPP) was incorporated into the MSN's nanochannels, to enable photodynamic therapy (PDT). cRGDyK peptides, tiling the outermost surfaces of MSNs, were used for targeting the overexpressed α

80052572374	Imaging the cellular uptake of tiopronin-modified gold nanoparticles	Well-dispersed gold nanoparticles (NP) coated with tiopronin were synthesized by X-ray irradiation without reducing agents. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy shows that the average core diameters of the NPs can be systematically controlled by adjusting the tiopronin to Au mole ratio in the reaction. Three methods were used to study the NP uptake by cells: quantitative measurements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, direct imaging with high lateral resolution transmission electron microscopy and transmission X-ray microscopy. The results confirmed that the NP internalization mostly occurred via endocytosis and concerned the cytoplasm. The particles, in spite of their small sizes, were not found to arrive inside the cell nuclei. The synthesis without reducing agents and solvents increased the biocompatibility as required for potential applications in analysis and biomedicine in general.

84861554723	Gold-coated polystyrene bead array and the investigation of their plasmon coupling abilities	Many of SERS nanoparticles took advantage of the surface roughness for the significant improvement of their Raman sensing ability. Nevertheless, few papers analyzed the characteristics of surface roughness nanostructures that contribute to the SERS. Thus, this paper investigates the characteristics of the corrugated polystyrene bead (PSB) array etched by a series of oxygen plasma etching time for giving a criterion to fabricate appropriate SERS-active nanoparticles. Three factors were considered in this paper: (1) the effect of plasma coupling among neighboring particles, (2) the vertical surface roughness of nanocorrugations, and (3) the pitch size, the lateral surface roughness, of nanocorrugations. By the analysis of SEM and AFM images, those factors were quantifiable. The correlation coefficient between each factor and SERS Raman enhancement was also investigated to verify that the pitch size of nanocorrugations (ranging from ∼6 nm to ∼12 nm on the surface of PSBs) dominates the SERS enhancement. Therefore, the maximum improvement of Raman intensity that derives from surface roughness treatment is 12 times compared to smooth surface. Moreover, it has a high enhancement factor of ∼10

84876708985	Quantum dots induced monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression via MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling pathways in macrophages	Quantum dots (QDs) are nano-sized semiconductors. Previously, intratracheal instillation of QD705s induces persistent inflammation in mouse lungs. In our present study, QD705-COOH and QD705-PEG activated NF-κB and increased monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in macrophages RAW264.7 via MyD88 dependent Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways. MyD88 is an adapter protein for most TLRs to activate NF-κB. Silencing expression of MyD88 or p65 with siRNA or co-treatment with a NF-κB inhibitor tremendously abolished QD705s-induced NF-κB activity and MCP-1 expression. The involved TLRs might locate either on the cell surface or inside of cells. Co-treatment with a TLR4 inhibitor completely prevented MCP-1 induction by QD705-PEG. Nevertheless, QD705-COOH readily entered cells, and co-treatment with either inhibitors of endocytosis or intracellular TLRs prevented MCP-1 induction. These findings indicate that, depending on their surface modification, OD705s activate MyD88 dependent-TLRs at the surface or inside of the cells, which is an important mechanism for nanoparticles-induced inflammatory responses. But other MyD88-independent pathways may also involve in these responses. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84897003843	Induced interleukin-33 expression enhances the tumorigenic activity of rat glioma cells	Background. Glioma development is a multistep process associated with progressive genetic alterations but also regulated by cellular and noncellular components in a tumor-associated niche. Methods. Using 2 rat C6 glioma cell clones with different tumorigenesis, named C6-1 and C6-2, this study characterized genes associated with enhanced tumorigenic features of glioma cells by comparative cDNA microarray analysis combined with Q-PCR. Neurospehere formation and clonogenicity were examined to determine the growth of tumorigenic C6 glioma cells. The lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown approach was conducted to determine the role of interleukin-33 (IL-33) in glioma cell proliferation and migration. Transwell cell invasion assay was used to examine microglia migration induced by tumorigenic C6 cells. Results. The functional analysis of gene ontology (GO) biological processes shows that the upregulated genes found in tumorigenic C6 (C6-1) cells are closely related to cell proliferation. Tumorigenic C6 cells expressed cytokines and chemokines abundantly. Among these genes, IL-33 was profoundly induced in tumorigenic C6 cells with the expression of IL-33 receptor ST2. Furthermore, the growth rate and colony formation of tumorigenic C6 cells were attenuated by the inhibition of IL-33 and ST2 gene expression. Moreover, IL-33 was involved in tumorigenic glioma cell migration and regulation of the expression of several glioma-associated growth factors and chemokines in tumorigenic C6 cells.ConclusionAccordingly, we concluded that glioma cells with abundant production of IL-33 grow rapidly; moreover, the interactions of multiple cytokines/chemokines induced by glioma cells may develop a microenvironment that facilitates microglia/macrophage infiltration and fosters glioma growth in the brain. © 2013 © The Author(s) 2013.

47249117440	Enhanced x-ray irradiation-induced cancer cell damage by gold nanoparticles treated by a new synthesis method of polyethylene glycol modification	We explored a very interesting gold nanoparticle system - pegylated gold in colloidal solution - and analyzed its uptake by mice colorectal adenocarcinoma CT26 tumor cells and the impact on the cell's response to x-ray irradiation. We found that exposure to polyethylene glycol (PEG) modified ('pegylated') 4.7 ± 2.6 nm gold nanoparticles synthesized by a novel synchrotron-based method enhances the response of CT26 cells to x-ray irradiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confocal microscopy revealed that substantial amounts of such nanoparticles are taken up and absorbed by the cells and this conclusion is supported by quantitative induced coupled plasma (ICP) results. Standard tests indicated that the internalized particles are highly biocompatible but strongly enhance the cell damage induced by x-ray irradiation. Synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) spectromicroscopy analyzed the chemical aspects of this phenomenon: the appearance of C = O stretching bond spectral features could be used as a marker for cell damage and confirmed the enhancement of the radiation-induced toxicity for cells. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

51349124827	Micro-patternable nanoporous polymer integrated with microstructures for molecular filtration	This paper proposes a facile method to fabricate nanoporous microstructures by a photo-patternable SU-8 photoresist, to serve as a molecular filter in microfluidic systems. The fabrication process involves solvent-controlled nanoporous structure formation combined with standard photolithography steps for microstructure fabrication. The self-formed nanoporous morphology embedded inside the microstructure exhibits a sufficient mechanical strength and eliminates complex processes or protocols for integration/assembly of nano- and microstructures. Field emission gun scanning electronic microscopy (FEGSEM) images showed the fabricated nanoporous morphologies with embedded nanogaps of about 6-10 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images also depicted a clear difference on the degree of porosity between the solvent-controlled SU-8 and the standard resist. Fluorescent dyes, namely Rhodamine-B and Rhodamine-6G, were employed to estimate the diffusivity of the fabricated SU-8 based nanofilter and demonstrated that the Rhodamine based fluorescent molecules can penetrate these nanosized filtration structures. The fabricated nanofilter was capable of providing a molecular weight cut-off range up to 70 kDa, estimated roughly for a molecule with a diameter of 6-10 nm. This simple process provides a novel way to integrate the nanofiltration capability into microstructures while maintaining a sufficient mechanical strength for molecular level filtration in lab-on-chip (LOC) systems. © IOP Publishing Ltd.

52049108266	Sustained intraspinal delivery of neurotrophic factor encapsulated in biodegradable nanoparticles following contusive spinal cord injury	Glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) induces neuronal survival and tissue repair after spinal cord injury (SCI). A continuous GDNF supply is believed to gain greater efficacy in the neural restoration of the injured spinal cord. Accordingly, nanovehicle formulation for their efficient delivery and sustained release in injured spinal cord was examined. We first used fluorescence-labeled bovine serum albumin (FBSA) loaded in biodegradable poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) for intraspinal administration after SCI and for in vitro study. Our results showed that the preservation of PLGA-FBSA was observed in the injured spinal cord at 24 h, and PLGA-FBSA nanoparticles were well absorbed by neurons and glia, indicating that PLGA as a considerable nanovehicle for the delivery of neuroprotective polypeptide into injured spinal cord. Furthermore, intraspinal injection of GDNF encapsulated in PLGA (PLGA-GDNF) nanoparticles into the injured spinal cord proximal to the lesion center had no effect on gliosis when compared to that observed in SCI rats receiving PLGA injection. However, local administration of PLGA-GDNF effectively preserved neuronal fibers and led to the hindlimb locomotor recovery in rats with SCI, providing a potential strategy for the use of PLGA-GDNF in the treatment of SCI. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, dual functional Gd-fluorescein isothiocyanate mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Gd-Dye@MSN) that possess green fluorescence and paramagnetism are developed in order to evaluate their potential as effective T1-enhancing trackers for human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSCs are labeled efficiently with Gd-Dye@MSN via endocytosis. Labeled hMSCs are unaffected in their viability, proliferation, and differentiation capacities into adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, which can still be readily MRI detected. Imaging, with a clinical 1.5-T MRI system and a low incubation dosage of Gd, low detection cell numbers, and short incubation times is demonstrated on both loaded cells and hMSC-injected mouse brains. This study shows that the advantages of biocompatibility, durability, high internalizing efficiency, and pore architecture make MSNs an ideal vector of T1-agent for stem-cell tracking with MRI. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The MWCNTs array was used as an induced-surface charge filter to attract the opposite charged molecules on the wall surface by van der Waals and electrostatic force. The surface charge of MWCNTs is inversely proportional to the channel wall thickness and proportional the dielectric constant of itself and the applied external electric-field. A modified RuOx particles MWCNTs electrode was used as electrochemical sensor to increase the reactive surface area and reduce the redox potential for 0.1 μM insulin detection. 0.5 μM FITC (fluorescein) and Rhodamine 6G dye mixtures during the electrokinetic trapping process, could be easily to separate by the electric property of dyes in a MCNTs filter nanochannel, the concentration capability of FITC as high as 5000-10000 folds have been demonstrated. For electrochemical behavior, the RuOx/MWCNTs electrodes could be efficient to reduce about 0.055-0.06V oxide potential compared with MWCNTs only electrodes. © 2007 IEEE.

Strong reflection induced by larger index mismatch and longer optical path from GNPs-protein conjugation are suggested to attribute most to the signal enhancement in F-P interference shift. The experiments carry out the monitoring of immuno-sensing in real-time by the employment of rabbit IgG conjugate to GNPs-anti-rabbit IgG. And the detection limit was demonstrated to approach 0.17 nM (∼25.5 ng/ml), which was three orders of magnitude better than those of the traditional fiber-based F-P biosensors. Besides, the reproducibility of the sensor has been tested through at least three cycles of detection/surface- regeneration process and demonstrated a reasonable consistency. The relationship between the concentrations of GNPs-antibody and F-P spectrum shift has also been characterized. The time-constant of this sensor to complete one cycle of biomolecule-detection and surface-regeneration can be as low as 4 minutes. © 2007 IEEE.

The impact on the structure and morphology of the gold nanoparticles of process parameters such as the PEG molecular weight, the PEG/gold molar ratio and the x-ray dosage were investigated. The size of PEG modified gold particles was found to decrease with increasing PEG addition and x-ray dosage. With the capability to monitor the absorption spectra in situ during the fast synthesis process, this opens the way to accurate control of the size and distribution. PEG chains with an intermediate length (MW6000) were found optimal for size control and colloidal stability in biologically relevant media. Our x-ray synthesized PEG-gold nanoparticles could find interesting applications in nanoparticle-enhanced x-ray tumour imaging and therapy. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The PDMS dip coating and self-assembly monolayers coating are employed to prepare the fiber probes in the formation of F-P cavity and modification of the tip surface respectively. As the fiber probe inserting into the target solution, the immunoreaction will be introduced on the fiber tip. The covalent binding of the Rabbit IgG and Anti Rabbit IgG-Cy3 molecules on the fiber tip will contribute to the variation of the refractive index of interface as well as the reflectance. The interference spectrum will be shifted due to the reflectance variation. The time response is also implemented by taking the in-situ measurement of spectrum valley shift and the signal will reach the steady state within IS minutes. Finally, the sensitivity of this immunoassay biosensor has also been demonstrated that the lowest detectable concentration of the target sample Anti Rabbit IgG-Cy3 is 10

65149101001	Thermosensitive liposomes entrapping iron oxide nanoparticles for controllable drug release	Iron oxide nanoparticles can serve as a heating source upon alternative magnetic field (AMF) exposure. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be mixed with thermosensitive nanovehicles for hyperthermia-induced drug release, yet such a design and mechanism may not be suitable for controllable drug release applications in which the tissues are susceptible to environmental temperature change such as brain tissue. In the present study, iron oxide nanoparticles were entrapped inside of thermosensitive liposomes for AMF-induced drug release while the environmental temperature was maintained at a constant level. Carboxyfluorescein was co-entrapped with the iron oxide nanoparticles in the liposomes as a model compound for monitoring drug release and environmental temperature was maintained with a water circulator jacket. These experiments have been successfully performed in solution, in phantom and in anesthetized animals. Furthermore, the thermosensitive liposomes were administered into rat forearm skeletal muscle, and the release of carboxylfluorescein triggered by the external alternative magnetic field was monitored by an implanted microdialysis perfusion probe with an on-line laser-induced fluorescence detector. In the future such a device could be applied to simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging and non-invasive drug release in temperature-sensitive applications. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

67649222984	The chemical fate of the Cd/Se/Te-based quantum dot 705 in the biological system: Toxicity implications	QD705 is a cadmium/selenium/tellurium (Cd/Se/Te)-based quantum dot with good potential for biomedical applications. Although the biological fate of QD705 is established, its chemical fate in the biological system is still unknown. Since the chemical nature of Cd in QD705 (either stays as bounded Cd or becomes free Cd) is closely related to the toxicity of this nanocrystal, information on its chemical fate is critically needed. In this study we investigated the chemical fate of QD705 in the kidneys of mice. We used the molar ratio of Cd and Te (increased Cd/Te ratio signifies increased Cd release from QD705) and the induction of tissue metallothionein (MT) as markers for elevated free Cd in tissues. Our study indicated that 100% of QD705 (measured as Cd) was still retained in the body 16 weeks after exposure, with significant time redistribution to the kidneys. Furthermore, there were an elevation in both the molar Cd/Te ratio and MT-1 expression in the kidneys, suggesting that free Cd was released from QD705. Thus QD705 is not as stable or biologically inert as many may have once believed. Our study demonstrated that free Cd indeed can be released from QD705 in the kidneys and increases the risk of renal toxicity. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

69549084325	A perfusion-based micro opto-fluidic system (PMOFS) for continuously in-situ immune sensing	This paper proposes a novel perfusion-based micro opto-fluidic system (PMOFS) as a reusable immunosensor for in-situ and continuous protein detection. The PMOFS includes a fiber optic interferometry (FOI) sensor housed in a micro-opto-fluidic chip covered with a microdialysis membrane. It features a surface regeneration mechanism for continuous detection. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) labeled anti-rabbit IgG were used to enhance the immune conjugation signal by the elongated optical path from GNPs conjugation. Surface regeneration of the sensor was achieved through local pH level manipulation by means of a photoactive molecule, o-Nitrobenzaldehyde (o-NBA), which triggered the elution of immune complexes. Experimental results showed that the pH level of the o-NBA solution can be reduced from 7 to 3.5 within 20 seconds under UV irradiation, sufficient for an effective elution process. The o-NBA molecules, contained within poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG) complexes, were trapped within the sensing compartment by the microdialysis membrane and would not leak into the outside environment. The pH variation was also limited in the neighborhood of the sensor surface, resulting in a self-contained sensing system. In-situ immune detection and surface regeneration of the sensing probe has been successfully carried out for two identical cycles by the same sensing probe, and the cycle time can be less than 8 minutes, which is so far the fastest method for continuous monitoring on protein/peptide molecules. In addition, the interference fringe shift of the sensor is linearly related to the concentration of anti-cytochrome C antibody solution and the detection limit approaches 10 ng/ml. © 2009 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

67749130818	Reactive oxygen species-induced cell death of rat primary astrocytes through mitochondria-mediated mechanism	Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell population in the central nervous system (CNS), play physiological roles in neuronal activities. Oxidative insult induced by the injury to the CNS causes neural cell death through extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This study reports that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by exposure to the strong oxidizing agent, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) as a chemical-induced oxidative stress model, caused astrocytes to undergo an apoptosis-like cell death through a caspase-3-independent mechanism. Although activating protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-κB were activated in Cr(VI)-primed astrocytes, the inhibition of their activity failed to increase astrocytic cell survival. The results further indicated that the reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was accompanied by an increase in the levels of ROS in Cr(VI)-primed astrocytes. Moreover, pretreatment of astrocytes with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), the potent ROS scavenger, attenuated ROS production and MMP loss in Cr(VI)-primed astrocytes, and significantly increased the survival of astrocytes, implying that the elevated ROS disrupted the mitochondrial function to result in the reduction of astrocytic cell viability. In addition, the nuclear expression of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (EndoG) was observed in Cr(VI)-primed astrocytes. Taken together, evidence shows that astrocytic cell death occurs by ROS-induced oxidative insult through a caspase-3-independent apoptotic mechanism involving the loss of MMP and an increase in the nuclear levels of mitochondrial pro-apoptosis proteins (AIF/EndoG). This mitochondria-mediated but caspase-3-independent apoptotic pathway may be involved in oxidative stress-induced astrocytic cell death in the injured CNS. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

69449095280	Nanostructured pillars based on vertically aligned carbon nanotubes as the stationary phase in micro-CEC	We present a micro-CEC chip carrying out a highly efficient separation of dsDNA fragments through vertically aligned multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a microchannel. The vertically aligned MWCNTs were grown directly in the microchannel to form straight nanopillar arrays as ordered and directional chromatographic supports. 1-Pyrenedodecanoic acid was employed for the surface modification of the MWCNTs' stationary phase to adsorb analytes by hydrophobic interactions. This device was used for separating dsDNA fragments of three different lengths (254, 360, and 572 bp), and fluorescence detection was employed to verify the electrokinetic transport in the MWCNT array. The micro-CEC separation of the three compounds was achieved in less than 300 s at a field strength of 66 V/cm due to superior laminar flow patterns and a lower flow resistance resulting from the vertically aligned MWCNTs being used as the stationary phase medium. In addition, a fivefold reduction of band broadening was obtained when the analyte was separated by the chromatographic MWCNT array channel instead of the CE channel. From all of the results, we suggest that an in situ grown and directional MWCNT array can potentially be useful for preparing more diversified forms of stationary phases for vertically efficient chip-based electrochromatography. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Therefore, we measured the plasma tHcy concentrations in 385 healthy Chinese subjects in Taiwan and in 40 patients with occluded coronary artery disease or maintenance hemodialysis. The plasma tHcy levels in Taiwanese male and female volunteers were found to increase gradually with age (age group: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and >60; mean ± SD 8.22 ± 2.00, 8.51 ± 2.67, 8.87 ± 2.22, 11.41 ± 2.50 and 13.28 ± 2.31 μM for male volunteers and 6.49 ± 1.75, 7.15 ± 1.20, 7.40 ± 1.30, 9.57 ± 3.01 and 10.95 ± 2.11 μM for female volunteers).

The competition between electroosmotic dragging force and nonlinear electrophoretic forces induced by polarization effect is suggested responsible for the setup of two preconcentration regimes at both cathodic and anodic sides of the nanochannel. The surface charge of MCNTs is inversely proportional to the channel wall thickness and proportional to the dielectric constant of the MCNTs as well as the applied external electric-field. Electrokinetic trapping and collection can be maintained for several minutes in this device. 1 μM FITC (fluorescein) and Rhodamine B dye mixtures were easily separated by the non-neutral and neutral property of the dyes in a MCNTs filter nanochannel.

71549145307	MWCNTs array incorporated nanochannel with charge-selectivity for high efficient biomolecule preconcentration	This paper presents a study of electrokinetic transport in a nano-fluidic chip that allows for the selection and pre-concentration of molecular mixtures by a high density multi-wall carbon nanotubes array (MCNTs) in nano-channels. Parylene (poly(p-xylylene) was deposited on MWCNTs walls as a dielectric material, the surface charge characters and density could adjusted when an induced polarizes filed was applied. The MCNTs array was used as an induced-surface charge filter to attract the charged molecules on the wall surface by van der Waals and electrostatic force. The surface charge of MCNTs is inversely proportional to the channel wall thickness and proportional to the dielectric constant of Parylene thin layer as well as the applied external electric-field. The competition between electroosmotic dragging force and nonlinear electrophoretic forces induced by polarization effect is suggested responsible for the setup of two preconcentration regimes at both cathodic and anodic sides of the nanochannel.

74549162102	Enhancement of irradiation effects on cancer cells by cross-linked dextran-coated iron oxide (CLIO) nanoparticles	We investigated iron oxide nanoparticles with two different surface modifications, dextran coating and cross-linked dextran coating, showing that their different internalization affects their capability to enhance radiation damage to cancer cells. The internalization was monitored with an ultrahigh resolution transmission x-ray microscope (TXM), indicating that the differences in the particle surface charge play an essential role and dominate the particle-cell interaction. We found that dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles cannot be internalized by HeLa and EMT-6 cells without being functionalized with amino groups (the cross-linked dextran coating) that modify the surface potential from -18 mV to 13.4 mV. The amount of cross-linked dextran-coated iron oxide nanoparticles uptaken by cancer cells reached its maximum, 1.33 × 10

77950455652	Surface deformation of gold nanorod-loaded poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles after near infrared irradiation: An active and controllable drug release system	A novel drug release method for poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles is reported. NIR laser irradiation (808 ± 3 nm) on gold nanorods (GNRs) co-encapsulated in PLGA nanoparticles triggered surface protuberances (as studied by AFM) and induced rapid drug release. The NIR thus acts as a non-invasive external light source for active and controllable drug release from the PLGA/GNR composite nanoparticles. This type of drug delivery system may be of value in in vivo target delivery in the future. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

77950978724	A Perfusion-based Micro Opto-fluidic System (PMOFS) with GNP signal enhancement for continuously in-situ immune sensing	This paper proposes a novel design of a reusable biosensor for in-situ and continuous protein detection. The sensing probe was practiced by the integration of a fiber optic interferometry (FOI) sensor accommodated in a micro optofluidic chip covered with a microdialysis membrane and surface regeneration mechanism for regenerable detection. Gold-nanoparticles (GNPs) labeled anti-rabbit IgG was used to enhance the protein conjugation signal due to an elongated optical path length by GNPs layer, providing extended interference fringe shift for signal enhancement. On the other hand, surface regeneration of the sensor was realized through local pH level manipulation by employing a photoactivable molecule, o-Nitrobenzaldehyde (o-NBA), for the elution of immune complex. Experimental results showed the o-NBA elution method can keep the pH variation to be limited close to the neighboring region of the sensor surface, providing a self-contained sensing system. In-situ immune detection and surface regeneration of the sensing probe was achieved successfully for two identical cycles on the same sensing probe, and 10ng/ml of detection limit can be approached. © 2009 IEEE NANO Organizers.

77951550848	Enhanced photoacoustic stability of gold nanorods by silica matrix confinement	Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has garnered much attention for its high contrast and excellent spatial resolution of perfused tissues. Gold nanorods (GNRs) have been employed to further enhance the imaging contrast of PAT. However, the photon fluences typically needed for PA wave induction often also result in GNR shape changes that significantly reduce the efficiency of acoustic wave generation. In this work, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate amorphous silica-coated gold nanorods (GNR-Si) in an effort to improve contrast agent stability and ameliorate efficiency loss during photoacoustic (PA) wave induction. TEM and optical absorption spectra measurements of GNR and GNR-Si show that encasing GNRs within amorphous silica provides substantial protection of nanorod conformation from thermal deformation. PA signals generated by GNR-Si demonstrate considerably greater resistance to degradation of signal intensity with repetitive pulsing than do uncoated GNRs, thereby enabling much longer, high-contrast imaging sessions than previously possible. The prolongation of high-contrast imaging, and biocompatibility and easy surface functionalization for targeting ligands afforded by amorphous silica, suggest GNR-Si to be potentially significant for the clinical translation of PAT. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

77952241901	Heat-activated sustaining nitric oxide release from zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate loaded in thermo-sensitive liposomes	Zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate, a nitric oxide precursor, was dissolved in basic buffer solution (pH = 9.0) and encapsulated in thermo-sensitive liposomes composed of phospholipids of different sensitive temperatures. The basic intra-liposomal environment dramatically delayed spontaneous NO release. When the liposomes were placed in physiological buffer solution and temperatures were increased to the sensitive temperatures of the phospholipids' membranes, extra-liposomal protons started to influx to collapse the pH gradient and subsequently induce a significant NO release. Moreover, the presence of a stronger pH gradient when the liposomes were applied to a more acidic environment caused a higher proton influx driving force to trigger the influx of protons and, subsequently, NO release. In this work, we demonstrate that thermo-sensitive liposomes can be used to create a stable pH gradient in a nanoenvironment entrapping zwitterionic diazeniumdiolate for sustained and heat/acid-activated NO release. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77952836882	In vivo monitoring of the transfer kinetics of trace elements in animal brains with hyphenated inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques	The roles of metal ions to sustain normal function and to cause dysfunction of neurological systems have been confirmed by various studies. However, because of the lack of adequate analytical method to monitor the transfer kinetics of metal ions in the brain of a living animal, research on the physiopathological roles of metal ions in the CNS remains in its early stages and more analytical efforts are still needed. To explicitly model the possible links between metal ions and physiopathological alterations, it is essential to develop in vivo monitoring techniques that can bridge the gap between metalloneurochemistry and neurophysiopathology. Although inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a very powerful technique for multiple trace element analyses, when dealing with chemically complex microdialysis samples, the detection capability is largely limited by instrumental sensitivity, selectivity, and contamination that arise from the experimental procedure. As a result, in recent years several high efficient and clean on-line sample pretreatment systems have been developed and combined with microdialysis and ICP-MS for the continuous and in vivo determination of the concentrationtime profiles of metal ions in the extracellular space of rat brain. This article reviews the research relevant to the development of analytical techniques for the in vivo determination of dynamic variation in the concentration levels of metal ions in a living animal. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77952891578	The inhibitory effect of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (Ferucarbotran) on osteogenic differentiation and its signaling mechanism in human mesenchymal stem cells	Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles are very useful for monitoring cell trafficking in vivo and distinguish whether cellular regeneration originated from an exogenous cell source, which is a key issue for developing successful stem cell therapies. However, the impact of SPIO labeling on stem cell behavior remains uncertain. Here, we show the inhibitory effect of Ferucarbotran, an ionic SPIO, on osteogenic differentiation and its signaling mechanism in human mesenchymal stem cells. Ferucarbotran caused a dose-dependent inhibition of osteogenic differentiation, abolished the differentiation at high concentration, promoted cell migration, and activated the signaling molecules, β-catenin, a cancer/testis antigen, SSX, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). An iron chelator, desferrioxamine, suppressed all the above Ferucarbotran-induced actions, demonstrating an important role of free iron in the inhibition of osteogenic differentiation that is mediated by the promotion of cell mobilization, involving the activation of a specific signaling pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77953641803	The protease-mediated nucleus shuttles of subnanometer gold quantum dots for real-time monitoring of apoptotic cell death	Subnanometer photoluminescent gold quantum dots (GQDs) are functionalized with a peptide moiety that contains both nuclear export signal (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences. By taking advantage of its small size and great photostability, the functionalized GQDs are used to mimic the actions of nucleus shuttle proteins, especially of those activated during cell apoptotic death, to work as protease-mediated cytoplasm-nucleus shuttles for dynamic monitoring of apoptosis. The resulting construct demonstrates activation of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) of cells, for bidirectional transport between nucleus and cytoplasm. A capsase-3 recognition sequence (DEVD), placed within the NLS/NES peptide, serves as a proteolytic site for activated caspase-3. Upon the induction of apoptosis, the activated caspase-3 cleaves the functional peptide on GQDs resulting in changes of subcellular distribution of GQDs. Such changes can be quantified as a function of time, by the ratios of GQDs photoluminescence in nucleus to that in cytoplasm. As such, the NES-linker-DEVD-linker-NLS peptide enables the GQDs to function as molecular probes for the real-time monitoring of cellular apoptosis. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77953020259	Surface charge-mediated rapid hepatobiliary excretion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles	Nanoparticle-assisted drug delivery has been emerging as an active research area in recent years. The in vivo biodistribution of nanoparticle and its following mechanisms of biodegradation and/or excretion determine the feasibility and applicability of such a nano-delivery platform in the practical clinical translation. In this work we report the synthesis of the highly positive charge, near-infrared fluorescent mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) that demonstrate rapid hepatobiliary excretion, for use as traceable drug delivery platforms of high capacity. MSNs were incorporated with near-infrared fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG) via covalent or ionic bonding, to derive comparable constructs of significantly different net surface charge. In vivo fluorescence imaging and subsequent inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy of harvested tissues, urine, and feces revealed markedly different uptake and elimination behaviors between the two conjugations; with more highly charged moieties (+34.4 mV at pH 7.4) being quickly excreted from the liver into the gastrointestinal tract, while less charged moieties (-17.6 mV at pH 7.4) remained sequestered within the liver. Taken together, these findings suggest that charge-dependent adsorption of serum proteins greatly facilitates the hepatobiliary excretion of silica nanoparticles, and that nanoparticle residence time in vivo can be regulated by manipulation of surface charge. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77953890447	The use of radioactive zinc oxide nanoparticles in determination of their tissue concentrations following intravenous administration in mice	The increasing uses of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) in coatings, paints, personal care products and many other products increase the possibility of the body's exposure to ZnONPs. Accurate and quantitative profiling on the tissue distribution and body clearance of ZnONPs, which is an important factor to clarify the acute and chronic safety concerns of ZnONPs, is interfered by the abundance of the body's endogenous zinc moiety. In this report, radioactive zinc oxide nanoparticles (R-ZnONPs) generated from neutron activation were employed for the in vivo bio-distribution studies using mice as the animal model. γ-Ray emitting radioactive R-ZnONPs were produced from neutron activation. Zeta potentials of the ZnONPs before and after the neutron irradiation remained about the same, and R-ZnONPs largely remained its original nano-particulate form after neutron irradiation. After intravenous administration into ICR mice, R-ZnONPs exhibited a primary retention in lung (43.6% injected dose (ID)/g tissue wet weight) for the first hour and began to be translocated to intestinal tract for feces excretion at a later stage. This type of labeling free and radioactive nanoparticles retains the surface property and can be a convenient protocol for studying bio-distribution of nanoparticles in pristine chemical form. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

77955985075	Synchrotron microangiography studies of angiogenesis in mice with microemulsions and gold nanoparticles	We present an effective solution for the problem of contrast enhancement in phase-contrast microangiography, with the specific objective of visualising small (<8 μm) vessels in tumor-related microangiogenesis. Different hydrophilic and hydrophobic contrast agents were explored in this context. We found that an emulsified version of the hydrophobic contrast agents Lipiodol® provides the best contrast and minimal distortion of the circulation and vessel structure. Such emulsions are reasonably biocompatible and, with sizes of 0 ± 0.8 μm, sufficient to diffuse to the smallest vessel and still provide reasonable contrast. We also explored the use of Au nanoparticle colloids that could be used not only to enhance contrast but also for interesting applications in nanomedicine. Both the Lipiodol microemulsions and Au nanoparticle colloids can be conjugated with medicines or cell specific labeling agents and their small size can allow the study of the diffusion of contrast agents through the vessel leakage. This enables direct imaging of drug delivery which is important for cancer treatment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77957851117	Tailored Au nanorods: Optimizing functionality, controlling the aspect ratio and increasing biocompatibility	Monodisperse gold nanorods with high aspect ratio were synthesized by x-ray irradiation. Irradiation was first used to stimulate the creation of seeds. Afterward, nanorod growth was stimulated either by chemical reduction or again by x-ray irradiation. In the last case, the entire process took place without reducing agents. The shape of the final products could be controlled by modulating the intensity of the x-ray irradiation during the seed synthesis. In turn, the nanorod aspect ratio determines the absorption wavelength of the nanorods that can thus be optimized for different applications. Likewise, the aspect ratio influences the uptake of the nanorods by HeLa cells. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

78249243903	Dynamic probing of nanoparticle stability in vivo: A liposomal model assessed using in situ microdialysis and optical imaging	Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery and controlled release has been a vigorous research area in contemporary nanomedicine. The in vivo stability of nanoparticle delivered on site is a prerequisite for the design of drug-controlled release by any means. In this study, the first methodology comprised of microdialysis and optical imaging to assess the liposome stability in vivo is reported. Macroscopically, we demonstrated the DPPG liposomes with negative surface charge fast accumulated in the rat liver upon their i.v. administration using optical imaging. Microscopically, the concurrent analysis of fluorescent molecules leaching from the liposomes, in situ sampled using microdialysis probe, provides the dynamic information of stability of DPPG liposomes locus in quo. The current combination of in situ microdialysis and optical imaging possesses a great potential for use as a platform technology to evaluate the nanoparticle stability and the bioavailability of drug payload released on targeted site in vivo.

78649724562	Fabrication of a SU-8-based polymer-enclosed channel with a penetrating UV/ozone-modified interior surface for electrokinetic separation of proteins	This paper introduces electrokinetic separation inside fully cross-linked epoxy-based polymer channels that were batch modified on the inner surfaces using a penetrating UV/ozone treatment from the outside. The treatment can employ either a 254 nm UV source in an ozone-rich environment or a stand-alone 172 nm UV source to directly generate C=O hydrophilic functional groups on the embedded polymer channel wall surfaces. Short-wavelength UV radiation was employed to break polymer surface bonds inside the channel. Ozone generated directly from air or supplied externally oxidized the reaction site on the activated polymer surface to generate the desired functional groups. An epoxy-based photoresist compound, SU-8 (MicroChem, MA), which is widely used in microfluidic systems, was employed to demonstrate the surface modification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS) were employed to characterize the functional groups that formed after the UV/ozone surface modification and to confirm the formation of O-H functional groups from the phenol group covalently bonded to the SU-8 surface, attributed mostly to the surface hydrophilicity modification. Water contact angles on the modified surface ranged from 72° to 12° depending on the processing time, UV power and ozone concentration. These angles were retained for at least 4 weeks after the process. Finally, the inner wall surfaces of the SU-8-enclosed channels were successfully modified using this technology, and rapid water transportation and EOF pumping were visualized inside the channel after surface modification. Successful electrokinetic separation of 10 mM BSA and 10 mM anti-rabbit IgG labeled with FITC inside the channel was also carried out. The polymer channel revealed a surface charge density of 75% of the zeta potential on a microslide glass surface, indicating the potential for molecule separation using polymer channels instead of glass channels. This simple process provides a novel way to integrate surface modification into microfluidic structures after fabrication for fully polymer-based lab-on-a-chip systems. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Nanofluidic systems with critical dimensions which were comparable to the molecular scales can provide the aforementioned performance, offering a novel basis for ultrasensitive and high-resolution bio-detections and medical diagnostics. Inspired by this concept, a nanofluidic system, integrated with a novel multi-nanocahnnel filter, an electrokinetic nano-preconcentrator, and a nanofluidic DAEKF detector for the detection of single cell releasing, is developed. A diluted solution of culture medium from PC-12 cells excited with excess nicotine concentration was detected with near single cell level amounts (c.a. 3000-10000 molecules) in this system after all processing in 20 min. Results showed that this multi-depth micro/nanofluidic chip exhibits superior sensitivity, efficiency, reliability, and reproducibility than those of conventional microchip electrophoresis /electrochromatography systems. ©2010 IEEE.

78650881501	Effects of combinatorial treatment with pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide and human mesenchymal stem cells on spinal cord tissue repair	The aim of this study is to understand if human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) have synergistic protective effect that promotes functional recovery in rats with severe spinal cord injury (SCI). To evaluate the effect of delayed combinatorial therapy of PACAP and hMSCs on spinal cord tissue repair, we used the immortalized hMSCs that retain their potential of neuronal differentiation under the stimulation of neurogenic factors and possess the properties for the production of several growth factors beneficial for neural cell survival. The results indicated that delayed treatment with PACAP and hMSCs at day 7 post SCI increased the remaining neuronal fibers in the injured spinal cord, leading to better locomotor functional recovery in SCI rats when compared to treatment only with PACAP or hMSCs. Western blotting also showed that the levels of antioxidant enzymes, Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and peroxiredoxin-1/6 (Prx-1 and Prx-6), were increased at the lesion center 1 week after the delayed treatment with the combinatorial therapy when compared to that observed in the vehicle-treated control. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that co-culture with hMSCs in the presence of PACAP not only increased a subpopulation of microglia expressing galectin-3, but also enhanced the ability of astrocytes to uptake extracellular glutamate. In summary, our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal that delayed transplantation of hMSCs combined with PACAP provides trophic molecules to promote neuronal cell survival, which also foster beneficial microenvironment for endogenous glia to increase their neuroprotective effect on the repair of injured spinal cord tissue. © 2010 Fang et al.

The results conclusively demonstrate that the particles strongly accumulate in tumor regions; up to ∼25 times more than in normal muscle tissue. This accumulation increases with the time after injection for up to ∼12 h in tumor, spleen and liver tissues, whereas for most non-tumor regions it saturates or decreases (blood, lung, brain, heart, and kidney). The impact of this result is discussed with special emphasis on passive targeted drug delivery and could also be used for the delineation and early-stage imaging of small tumors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79551643954	Reduction in antioxidant enzyme expression and sustained inflammation enhance tissue damage in the subacute phase of spinal cord contusive injury	Background: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) forms a disadvantageous microenvironment for tissue repair at the lesion site. To consider an appropriate time window for giving a promising therapeutic treatment for subacute and chronic SCI, global changes of proteins in the injured center at the longer survival time points after SCI remains to be elucidated. Methods. Through two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE)-based proteome analysis and western blotting, we examined the differential expression of the soluble proteins isolated from the lesion center (LC) at day 1 (acute) and day 14 (subacute) after a severe contusive injury to the thoracic spinal cord at segment 10. In situ apoptotic analysis was used to examine cell apoptosis in injured spinal cord after adenoviral gene transfer of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, administration of chondroitinase ABC (chABC) was performed to analyze hindlimb locomotor recovery in rats with SCI using Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale. Results: Our results showed a decline in catalase (CAT) and Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) found at day 14 after SCI. Accordingly, gene transfer of SOD was introduced in the injured spinal cord and found to attenuate cell apoptosis. Galectin-3, -actin, actin regulatory protein (CAPG), and F-actin-capping protein subunit (CAPZB) at day 14 were increased when compared to that detected at day 1 after SCI or in sham-operated control.

79751492230	The molecular mechanism of leptin secretion and expression induced by aristolochic acid in kidney fibroblast	Background: Leptin is a peptide hormone playing pivotal role in regulating food intake and energy expenditure. Growing evidence has suggested the pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic properties of leptin. In addition, patients with renal fibrosis have higher level of plasma leptin, which was due to the increased leptin production. Aristolochic acid (AA) is a botanical toxin characterized to associate with the development of renal fibrosis including tubulointerstitial fibrosis. However, whether leptin is upregulated to participate in AA-induced kidney fibrosis remain completely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, leptin expression was increased by sublethal dose of AA in kidney fibroblast NRK49f determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Data from real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction revealed that leptin was upregulated by AA at transcriptional level. DNA binding activity of CCAAT enhancer binding protein α (C/EBP α), one of the transcription factors for leptin gene, was enhanced in DNA affinity precipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Knockdown of C/EBP α expression by small interfering RNA markedly reduced AA-induced leptin expression. Moreover, AA promoted Akt interaction with p-PDK1, and increased phosphorylated activation of Akt. Akt knockdown, and inhibition of Akt signaling by LY294002 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin reduced leptin expression. Furthermore, treatment of LY294002 or rapamycin significantly suppressed AAinduced C/EBP α DNA-binding activity. These results suggest that Akt and C/EBP α activation were involved in AA-regulated leptin expression. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings demonstrate the first that AA could induce secretion and expression of fibrogenic leptin in kidney fibroblasts, which reveal potential involvement of leptin in the progression of kidney fibrosis in aristolochic acid nephropathy. © 2011 Lin et al.

79952108787	Pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of nanoparticles	The worldwide commerce involving nanoparticles will soon reach $1 trillion and already we have more than 600 commercial products containing nanoparticles. Because nanoparticles are invisible and little is known about their toxicities, there has been concern about health effects in humans. As toxicology is a continuum of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, this is a review of recent advances on pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling involving nanoparticles. We provide a synopsis of the state-of-the-science on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of nanoparticles in mammals, as well as some of the unique applications of pharmacokinetics to nanotechnology. Earlier, the main emphasis of pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles centered around the "control release" of drugs. Thus, drugs encapsulated by lipidic nanoparticles or bound to nano-particles form a controlled-release mechanism. The end results included, among others, enhancement of therapeutic duration and reversion of multidrug resistance. As the science advances in this area, the resulting achievements included: (1) utilizing nanoparticles as delivery vehicle for drugs, drug combinations, or genetic materials; (2) capitalizing on physico-chemical properties and tissue affinity of nanoparticles for medical imaging; (3) potentiating drug effects on immunotoxin and anticancer drugs; and (4) creating "stealth" capability from body's defense system. More recently, the application of biologically-based computer modeling to nanoparticles made it possible not only for inter-species, inter-routes, and inter-dose extrapolations but also for the integration of the modern tumor biology and computational technology for the possible improvement of cancer chemotherapy. Although pharmacokinetics and PBPK modeling of nanoparticles are still in their infancy, impressive innovations have already been demonstrated in their applications to medical sciences. Nanotoxicology is one of the most promising and fertile areas of science given the importance of nanoparticles to the economy of the 21st century, their possible environmental fates, as well as the potential health concerns of these particles.

79952114152	In vivo monitoring of quantum dots in the extracellular space using push-pull perfusion sampling, online in-tube solid phase extraction, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry	To monitor the dynamic changes of extracellular quantum dots (QDs) in vivo in the livers of anesthetized rats, we developed an automatic online analytical system comprising push - pull perfusion (PPP) sampling, the established in-tube solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). The method takes advantage of the retention of QDs onto the interior surface of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube as a means of extracting the QDs from complicated push-pull perfusates. For the injected QDs present in the liver extracellular fluid (ECF) at low picomolar levels, a temporal resolution of 10 min was required to collect sufficient amounts of QDs to meet the sensitivity requirements of the ICPMS system. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to exploit the PPP technique for the collection of QDs from living animals and PTFE tubing as a SPE adsorbent for the online extraction of QDs and the removal of biological matrix prior to ICPMS analysis of cadmium-containing inorganic nanocrystal. We confirmed the analytical reliability of this method from measurements of the spike recoveries of saline samples; in addition, we demonstrated the systems' applicability through in vivo monitoring of the time-dependent concentration profile of liver extracellular QDs in living rats after intravenous administration. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

79951773437	In vivo magnetic resonance imaging of cell tropsim, trafficking mechanism, and therapeutic impact of human mesenchymal stem cells in a murine glioma model	Stem cells have offered much promise as delivery vehicles for brain tumor therapy, with the development of modalities to track the tumor tropism of stem cells receiving intense focus. Cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows serial high-resolution in vivo detection of transplanted stem cells' tropism toward gliomas in the mouse brain once these cells are internally labeled with iron oxide particles, but has been impeded by low labeling efficiencies. In this study, we describe the use of ferucarbotran and protamine (Fer-Pro) complexes for labeling human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for MRI tracking of glioma tropism in vivo. We found that Fer-Pro was not toxic and was highly efficient for labeling in vitro. Cell labeling with Fer-Pro promoted the migration of hMSCs toward glioma U87MG cells in vitro, which was mediated by stromal-derived factor-1/CXCR4 (SDF-1/CXCR4) signaling. Fer-Pro-labeled hMSCs could migrate specifically toward gliomas in vivo, which was observed with a clinical 1.5-T MRI system. The efficient labeling of Fer-Pro also allowed a tropic mechanism mediated by SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling to be detected by MRI in vivo. Additionally, the potential intrinsic inhibitory effect of hMSCs on glioma progression was estimated simultaneously. This is the first report to have used a clinical MRI modality to simultaneously study the migration, the therapeutic impact on tumors, and above all the trafficking mechanism of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells from human in a murine glioma xenograft model. The use of Fer-Pro for stem cell labeling may have potential clinical applications in stem cell guided therapy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79952846226	Comparative tissue distributions of cadmium chloride and cadmium-based quantum dot 705 in mice: Safety implications and applications	Cadmium (Cd) is a component in quantum dot 705 (QD705). Whether QD705 behaves similar to Cd in vivo is of great concern. We compared the distributional kinetics of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and QD705 in mice after intravenous injection. QD705 showed a longer plasma and body retention than CdCl2 and could be detected in the brain during early exposure. While both the liver and spleen demonstrated a constant Cd concentration for 28 days after QD705 injection, it is likely that this represents intact QD705 stored in mononuclear phagocytes. The kidneys showed a time-dependent accumulation of Cd in the QD705-exposed animals. By day 28, Cd in the kidneys from QD705 was 3-fold that of CdCl2. QD705 and CdCl2 have very different kinetics in distribution and metabolism. The long body retention of QD705 in the kidneys may mean that QD705 has even more renal toxicity than CdCl2. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

79953282301	Ultrafine PEG-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles formulated by hydrophobic surfactant-assisted one-pot synthesis for biomedical applications	A novel method was developed for the one-pot synthesis of ultrafine poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs), using an emulsion solvent evaporation formulation method. Using either cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or poly(ethylene glycol)-distearyl phosphoethanolamine (PEGPE) as an oily emulsifier during the emulsion process, produced PLGA particle sizes of less than 50nm, constituting a breakthrough in emulsion formulation methods. The yield of ultrafine PLGA NPs increased with PEGPE/PLGA ratio, reaching a plateau at around 85%, when the PEGPE/PLGA ratio reached 3:1. The PEGPE-PLGA NPs exhibited high drug loading content, reduced burst release, good serum stability, and enhanced cell uptake rate compared with traditional PLGA NPs. Sub-50nm diameter PEG-coated ultrafine PLGA NPs show great potential for invivo drug delivery systems. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

79956028537	Enhanced chemotherapy of cancer using pH-sensitive mesoporous silica nanoparticles to antagonize P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major clinical obstacle in the management of cancer by chemotherapy. Overexpression of ATP-dependent efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (PGP) is a key factor contributing to multidrug resistance of cancer cells. The purpose of the present study was to use the endosomal pH-sensitive MSN (mesoporous silica nanoparticles; MSN-Hydrazone-Dox) for controlled release of doxorubicin (Dox) in an attempt to overcome the PGP-mediated MDR. In vitro cell culture studies indicate that uptake of MSN-Hydrazone-Dox by the human uterine sarcoma MES-SA/Dox-resistant tumor (MES-SA/Dx-5) cell occurs through endocytosis, thus bypassing the efflux pump resistance. This improves the efficacy of the drug and leads to significant cytotoxicity andDNAfragmentation evidenced by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and DNA laddering assays. In vivo studies show that the intratumor injection of MSN-Hydrazone-Dox induces significant apoptosis of MES-SA/Dox-resistant cancer cells. This is validated by active caspase-3 immunohistochemical analysis. However, MSN-Hydrazone, without doxorubicin conjugation, cannot induce apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, both in vitro and in vivo studies show that MSN could serve as an efficient nanocarrier entering cell avidly via endocytosis, thus bypassing the PGP efflux pump to compromise the PGP-mediated MDR. MSN-Hydrazone-Dox could further respond to endosomal acidic pH to release doxorubicin in a sustained manner. Besides the cell study, this is the first report that successfully shows the therapeutic efficacy of using MSN against MDR cancer in vivo. ©2011 AACR.

79956222018	Three-dimensional tracking and temporal analysis of liposomal transport in live cells using bright-field imaging	Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) confined in liposomes of diameters around 200 nm produce strong scattering signal owing to surface plasmon resonance, and therefore bright-field optical tracking of the AuNP-encapsulating liposomes can be conducted in living cells. Using an optical profiling technique called noninterferometric wide-field optical profilometry and a bright-field tracking algorithm, the polynomial-fit Gaussian weight method, we analyze three-dimensional (3D) motion of such liposomes in living fibroblasts. The positioning accuracy in three dimensions is nearly 20 nm. We tag the liposome membranes with fibroblast growth factor-1 and reveal the intracellular transportation processes toward or away from the nucleus. On the basis of a temporal analysis of the intracellular 3D trajectories of AuNP-encapsulating liposomes, we identify directed and diffusive motions in the transportation processes. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

0035809817	On-line, continuous and automatic monitoring of extracellular malondialdehyde concentration in anesthetized rat brain cortex	An assay for in vivo, continuous and automatic monitoring of extracellular malondialdehyde concentrations in anesthetized rat brain cortex was developed. This method involved the use of microdialysis perfusion, on-line derivatization and on-line high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Microdialysate from an implanted microdialysis probe was on-line reacted with thiobarbituric acid at 80°C for 10 min prior to on-line collection and automatic injection into a HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. This method gave a linear response between the concentrations of the malondialdehyde in the microdialysates and the TEP solution where the microdialysis probe was placed. This method was used to observe the increased extracellular malondialdehyde production following elevated extracellular glutamate levels, which were achieved by perfusion of L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate, a competitive inhibitor of glutamate uptake transporter. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0035937033	High performance liquid chromatography with fluorimetric detection for the determination of total homocysteine in human plasma: Method and clinical applications	Homocysteine (Hcy), an amino acid derived from methionine is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. We have developed a convenient high performance liquid chromatography assay with fluorimetric detection for the accurate determination of Hcy in human plasma. This assay involves direct addition of human plasma to methanolic monobromobimane for simultaneous protein precipitation and thiol derivatization. The assay was validated by adding authentic homocysteine and homocystine to plasma samples with recovery rates between 95.5 and 102.4%. The relative standard deviations for intraday (n = 7) and interday (n = 6, 10 consecutive days) analysis were 0.7-3.9 and 0.7-4.0%, respectively. Reference values of plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) have been determined for men and women, showing a significant difference (P < 0.05) between genders.

0035975265	The involvement of glutamate in recall of the conditioned NK cell response	The molecular mechanisms responsible for the conditioned enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity were investigated. The primary goal of the study was to examine the roles of glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in recall of the conditioned NK cell response. Both neurochemical blocking assay and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique were used in the study. Results from the neurochemical blocking assay demonstrated that glutamate but not GABA was required in recall of the conditioned NK cell response. NMDA but not the kainate/AMPA receptors, are believed to be involved. The levels of glutamate that were released and/or taken up also appeared to be critical in that interruption of glutamate release and/or uptake blocked the conditioned NK cell response. Results from the HPLC analysis, however, did not show any significant difference in the glutamate content between the conditioned and control brains. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

79959778812	One-pot tuning of Au nucleation and growth: From nanoclusters to nanoparticles	We describe a simple and effective method to obtain colloidal surface-functionalized Au nanoparticles. The method is primarily based on irradiation of a gold solution with high-flux X-rays from a synchrotron source in the presence of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA). Extensive tests of the products demonstrated high colloidal density as well as excellent stability, shelf life, and biocompatibility. Specific tests with X-ray diffraction, UV-visible spectrometry, visible microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dark-field visible-light scattering microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that MUA, being an effective surfactant, not only allows tunable size control of the nanoparticles, but also facilitates functionalization. The nanoparticle sizes were 6.45 ± 1.58, 1.83 ± 1.21, 1.52 ± 0.37 and 1.18 ± 0.26 nm with no MUA and with MUA-to-Au ratios of 1:2, 1:1, and 3:1. The MUA additionally enabled functionalization with l-glycine. We thus demonstrated flexibility in controlling the nanoparticle size over a large range with narrow size distribution. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80051930707	Au-coated polystyrene nanoparticles with high-aspect-ratio nanocorrugations via surface-carboxylation-shielded anisotropic etching for significant SERS signal enhancement	Increasing the hot-spot area with high enhancement ability on SERS-active particles is generally acknowledged as one of the efficient ways to significantly improve the average SERS signal of nanoparticles. A method to create roughness on the surface of nanoparticles was proposed by oxygen plasma etching noncarboxylated polystyrene beads. However, the mechanism of nanocorrugation formation was not clear. Thus, in this paper, we employ argon-based reactive ion etching (RIE) incorporated with carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles to investigate the roles of nanocorrugations- morphologies for SERS signal enhancement. The formation mechanism of the nanocorrugations has been investigated thoroughly through a comparison with those formed by oxygen-based RIE processes from their high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra and surface morphologies with or without hydrazine reduction treatment. Moreover, polystyrene beads with more intrinsic carboxyl groups and etched by argon plasma produce higher nanocorrugations. It is suggested that carbonyl groups with high bond energy become nanomasks on polystyrene bead surfaces and provides high selectivity between carboxyl and polystyrene surfaces under RIE. Raman intensity enhancement on a 20-nm gold coated nanocorrugated polystyrene bead array is summarized by three factors: (1) the effect of plasmonic coupling among neighboring particles, (2) the nanocorrugation-contributed roughness, and (3) the pitch size of nanocorrugations, through the analysis of SEM images, AFM height images, and LSPR signals. Among these factors, the pitch size of nanocorrugations (ranging from ∼6 nm to ∼12 nm on the surface of polystyrene beads) dominates the SERS enhancement. The 870 nm/120s oxygen plasma etched polystyrene beads (OPSBs) with a minimum pitch size of 6 nm provides the highest Raman intensity enhancement (measured by 632.8-nm He-Ne laser), which is 12 times greater than the intensity of nontreated (870 nm/0s) polystyrene beads (while the Au/Ti coating is 20 nm/5 nm). © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80053899359	Size separation of ultrafine PEG-coated polycaprolactone nanoparticle and morphological studies by AFM	Novel ultrafine polycaprolactone nanoparticles (PCL NPs) were prepared using poly(ethyleneglycol)2000-distearyl phosphoethanolamine (PEGPE) as the oily phase emulsifier in the emulsion process, resulting in PEG-coated PCL NPs (PEGPE-PCL), which could be reduced and confined in size to below 50 nm. Size separation of PEG-coated polymer NPs remain significant challenges in the preparation for fundamental studies and applications. We used a gel filtration chromatography method for the rapid size separation of PEGPE-PCL and studied the physicochemical characteristics. The morphology of the core-shell PEGPE-PCL on a mica surface followed by NP concentration was observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is important to separate size and define PEGPE-PCL structure for further potential in drug delivery application.

Mice were intravenously injected with QD705 and then sacrificed at week 12 or 16. Homeostasis of antioxidant-related metals, antioxidant activities, induction of oxidative stress, and toxicity in the liver were investigated. Although no histopathological change was observed, a time-and dose-dependent increase in metallothionein expression and reduction in liver function was noticed. Increased copper, zinc, and selenium levels and enhancements of the trace metal-corresponding transporters were noted at week 12. At week 16, a decline of selenium from its elevated level at week 12 was observed, which was accompanied by changes in glutathione peroxidase activity as well as in redox status. A significant reduction in superoxide dismutase activity was observed at 16 weeks. Furthermore, a corresponding elevation of heme oxygenase-1 expression, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha suggested the presence of oxidative stress, oxidative DNA damage and inflammation. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

80755189680	Recent advances in dynamic monitoring of drug release of nanoparticle using Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence lifetime imaging	In this review, we summarized the recent advances in dynamic monitoring of drug release of nanoparticle using FRET and FLIM. Using FRET to understanding the dynamics of drug released from its nanocarrier within intracellular milieu provides high sensitivity and temporal information of the releasing profile. Such information is crucial for the design of drug carriers and validation of drug controlled release. This approach thus has been prevailingly used in monitoring of drug release from a variety of DDS, including quantum dot-, polymer-, and silica-based delivery systems. Alternatively, FLIM assessing changes of micro-environment of drug possesses great potential for use in profiling the intracellular drug release and subcellular drug distribution with various DDS. Our recent approach using FLIM for mapping the intracellular Dox released from pH-responsive MSN has exemplified the feasibility of delineating subcellular distribution of fluorescent drug with corresponding variation of fluorescence lifetime. Both FRET and FLIM are emerging as important techniques in assessing the efficiency of targeted delivery and controlled release of drug with different nanodelivery systems.

82955233185	Well-defined mesoporous nanostructure modulates three-dimensional interface energy transfer for two-photon activated photodynamic therapy	Two-photon activated-photodynamic therapy (TPA-PDT) allows for spatially selective treatment of cancers, and enhances the tissue penetration depth of incident light. The three dimensional (3D) interface energy transfers in hexagonal mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) can significantly enhance the photodynamic effect. By providing a well-defined mesoporous nanostructure, we established an efficient and controllable energy transfer mechanism via the facile modification of a two-photon antenna molecule and photosensitizer on different topological domains in the MSN. The cytotoxicity induced by the singlet oxygen, generated following relay of energy transfer, was demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo breast cancer models. Therefore, our results contribute new insight to the highly efficient energy transfer within a single nanoparticle for two-photon activated PDT, worthwhile for studying its potential for development in clinical translation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84555163667	Iron oxide nanoparticle-induced epidermal growth factor receptor expression in human stem cells for tumor therapy	Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles show promise as labels for cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the application of stem cell-based therapy. However, the unaddressed concerns about the impact of SPIO nanoparticles on stem cell attributes make the feasibility of SPIO labeling uncertain. Here, we show that the labeling of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with ferucarbotran can induce epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression. Labeled hMSCs with their overexpressed EGFR were attracted by tumorous EGF and more effectively migrated toward tumor than unlabeled cells, resulting in more potent intrinsic antitumor activity. Moreover, the captured binding of tumorous EGF by overexpressed EGFR of labeled hMSCs blocked EGF/EGFR signaling-derived tumor growth, tumorous angiogenesis, and tumorous VEGF expression also responsible for tumor progression and development. Our results show that the impact of SPIO nanoparticles on stem cell attributes is not necessarily harmful but can be cleverly used to be beneficial to stem cell-based therapy. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84860908489	Nanocapillary electrophoretic electrochemical chip: Towards analysis of biochemicals released by single cells	A novel nanocapillary electrophoretic electrochemical (Nano-CEEC) chip has been developed to demonstrate the possibility of zeptomole-level detection of neurotransmitters released from single living cells. The chip integrates three subunits to collect and concentrate scarce neurotransmitters released from single PC-12 cells, including a pair of targeting electrodes for single cells captured by controlling the surface charge density; a dual-asymmetry electrokinetic flow device for sample collection, pre-concentration and separation in a nanochannel; and an online electrochemical detector for zeptomole-level sample detection. This Nano-CEEC chip integrates a polydimethylsiloxane microchannel for cell sampling and biomolecule separation and a silicon dioxide nanochannel for sample pre-concentration and amperometric detection. The cell-capture voltage ranges from 0.1 to 1.5 V with a frequency of 1-10 kHz for PC-12 cells, and the single cell-capture efficiency is optimized by varying the duration of the applied field. All of the processes, from cell sampling to neurotransmitter detection, can be completed within 15 min. Catecholamines, including dopamine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) released from coupled single cells, have been successfully detected using the Nano-CEEC chip. A detection limit of 30-75 zeptomoles was achieved, which is close to the levels released by a single neuron in vitro. © 2011 The Royal Society.

84863900227	Size control of gold nanoparticles by intense X-ray irradiation: The relevant parameters and imaging applications	We report the analysis of a reducing-agent-free synthetic method based on intense X-ray irradiation in the presence of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and their application in biomedical imaging. The method is very effective in controlling the size and size distribution of Au nanoparticles in colloidal solutions: gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as small as ∼1.2 ± 0.25 nm are synthesized in a one-pot irradiation procedure without reducing agents. We found two coexisting properties of these small AuNPs: a strong visible fluorescence and very high accumulation in cells, which enabled a new type of multimodality imaging using X-ray and visible light microscopies. These properties come as a direct consequence of the precise size control; specifically, they exist only when the particle size is smaller than ∼1.4 nm. We found that this process critically depends on several parameters including the solution pH, the solution temperature and the irradiation time. Most important is the fact that the increase of the irradiation time is not necessarily beneficial, since an optimum value exists to obtain small particles with a narrow size distribution. The 1.4 nm AuNPs are not toxic and significantly accumulate in tumor tissues in animal tests, as confirmed by X-ray imaging and fluorescence microscopy. This biodistribution could open the way for the use of these nanoparticles in X-ray imaging. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84864594560	Electronic microscopy evidence for mitochondria as targets for Cd/Se/Te-based quantum dot 705 toxicity in vivo	The safety of quantum dots (QDs) 705 was evaluated in this study. Mice were treated with QD705 (intravenous) at a single dose of (40 pmol) for 4, 12, 16, and 24 weeks. Effects of QD705 on kidneys were examined. While there was a lack of histopathology, reduction in renal functions was detected at 16 weeks. Electron microscopic examination revealed alterations in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) cell mitochondria at even much earlier time, including disorientation and reduction of mitochondrial number (early change), mitochondrial swelling, and later compensatory mitochondrial hypertrophy (enlargement mitochondria: giant mitochondria with hyperplastic inner cristae) as well as mitochondrial hyperplasia (increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and numbers) were observed. Such changes probably represent compensatory attempts of the mitochondria for functional loss or reduction of mitochondria in QD705 treated animals. Moreover, degeneration of mitochondria (myelin-figure and cytoplasmic membranous body formation) and degradation of cytoplasmic materials (isolated cytoplasmic pockets of degenerated materials and focal cytoplasmic degradation) also occurred in later time points (16-24 weeks). Such mitochondrial changes were not identical with those induced by pure cadmium. Taken together, we suggest that mitochondria appeared to be the target of QD705 toxicity and specific mitochondrial markers may be useful parameters for toxicity assessments of QDs or other metal-based nanomaterials.

84864659615	Visualizing dynamics of sub-hepatic distribution of nanoparticles using intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy	Nanoparticles that do not undergo renal excretion or in vivo degradation into biocompatible debris often accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system, also know as the mononuclear phagocyte system, with undesired consequences that limit their clinical utility. In this work, we report the first application of intravital multiphoton fluorescence microscopy to dynamically track the hepatic metabolism of nanoparticles with subcellular resolution in real time. Using fluorescently labeled mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) in mice as a prototypical model, we observed significant hepatocyte uptake of positively charged, but not negatively charged, moieties. Conversely, in vivo imaging of negatively charged, but not positively charged, MSNs reveals an overwhelming propensity for the former's rapid uptake by Kupffer cells in liver sinusoids. Since the only prerequisite for these studies was that nanoparticles are fluorescently labeled and not of a specific composition or structure, the techniques we present can readily be extended to a wide variety of nanoparticle structures and surface modifications (e.g., shape, charge, hydrophobicity, PEGylation) in the preclinical assessment and tailoring of their hepatotoxicities and clearances. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

However, these residual auxiliaries may affect polymer functions and cause toxicity, therefore, a time-consuming purification process is essential. Recently, synchrotron light has been established for generation of radicals in water without catalysts and initiators for polymerization. In this study, we used intensive synchrotron light as a potential tool to synthesize non-linear polyethylene glycol (NLPEG) which exhibits excellent protein-resistant property as compared to linear PEG (LPEG) on the surface. This novel synthesis concept provides an opportunity to produce NLPEG in a very short time (5 min) without employing various chemicals (pollutants) and with minimum environmental concern. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

We specifically obtained high-quality microradiographs of human and mouse cells with 29. nm Rayleigh spatial resolution and verified that tomographic reconstruction could be implemented with a final resolution level suitable for subcellular features. We also demonstrated that a phase retrieval method based on a wave propagation algorithm could yield good subcellular images starting from a series of defocused microradiographs.

0037273038	Ionotropic glutamate receptors are involved in malondialdehyde production in anesthetized rat brain cortex: A microdialysis study	Elevated extracellular glutamate levels can increase malondialdehyde production in the brains of anesthetized rats. Thus, we investigated whether ionotropic glutamate receptors are involved in glutamate-induced malondialdehyde production. A microdialysis probe was implanted in the brain cortex of anesthetized rats. The malondialdehyde level in microdialysates was analyzed using an HPLC system. Three different ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists were used. At a concentration of 1.5 mM α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid hydrobromide (AMPA, a selective AMPA receptor agonist) induced a dramatic increase in extracellular malondialdehyde production (as much as 14-fold relative to the basal value). N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA, a selective NMDA receptor agonist) also induced an increase in extracellular malondialdehyde production; however, the increase was not as much as that observed in the perfusion of AMPA receptor agonist. Kainic acid (a selective kainate receptor agonist) did not significantly increase malondialdehyde production. When co-perfused with L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (PDC; 31.4 mM), a glutamate uptake transport inhibitor that can increase the extracellular glutamate levels, AMPA receptor antagonist [1-(4-aminophenyl)4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride, 1.0 mM] can significantly reduce PDC-induced malondialdehyde production. Although NMDA receptor antagonist [(5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- imine hydrogen maleate, MK801] also can decrease the PDC-induced malondialdehyde production, it was not as effective as the AMPA receptor antagonist. These results suggest that ionotropic receptors are involved in the glutamate-induced increase in malondialdehdye production. Specifically, AMPA receptor seems to be predominant in the glutamate-induced malondialdehdye production in anesthetized rat brain cortex.

0037348774	A phosphorescence imaging system for monitoring of oxygen distribution in rat liver under ischemia and reperfusion	Oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence has been validated as a useful and essentially noninvasive optical method for measuring oxygen both in vitro and in vivo. The capability of imaging oxygen distribution based on phosphorescence quenching provides a highly useful tool for investigation of oxygen delivery in tissues at the microvascular level. We demonstrated the implementation of a phosphorescence imaging system incorporating an intensified, gated, monochrome CCD camera which equips a red sensitive Gen III cathode and power supply. By selecting of the delay time sequence for phosphorescence imaging in accordance with the quenching constant and lifetime at zero oxygen of used phosphor, a series of phosphorescence intensity images corresponding to the oxygen pressures within the region of interest would be acquired and digitized. The phosphorescence lifetimes were converted form the digitized intensity levels pixel by pixel upon the assumption of single exponential decay of phosphorescence. Thus, the oxygen distribution of interested area could be calculated from the phosphorescence lifetime map in virtue of well-defined Stern-Volmer equation. Two new phosphors of Generation 2 polyglutamic Pd-porphyrin-dendrimers were used in present study, which have high water solubility and intend to stay in blood circulation without extravasating through the vascular membrane. A Pd-meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl) porphyrin based phosphor termed Oxyphor G2 was used in testing of the instrument. The changes of hepatic oxygen pressure under the portal triad clamping model (PTC model) of ischemia and subsequent reperfusion were real-time monitored by phosphorescence imaging. The images indicated a transient recovery of hepatic oxygen level during the reperfusion following the PTC ligation. The lack of complete restoration of oxygen level has been implicated to the similar pattern of hepatic blood flow observed during reperfusion in previous reports. The other phosphor Oxyphor G2, derived from Pd-meso-tetra-(4-carboxyphenyl) tetrabenzoporphyrin, was recognized by its near infrared spectral characteristic. The calibration of Oxyphor G2 illustrated the independence of quenching constant to pH in the physiological range (6.4 to 7.8) and as such to make it a suitable phosphor for oxygen measurements, especially for those at depth in tissue.

84870445582	Fabrication and modification of dual-faced nano-mushrooms for tri-functional cell theranostics: SERS/fluorescence signaling, protein targeting, and drug delivery	Smart nanocarriers with high SERS enhancement are inevitably important in cancer therapy for treating cells and recording their changes at the single-molecule scale. Therefore, this work reports an approach to fabricating and modifying mass-produced dual-faced and tri-functional nanoparticles for sequentially recognizing tumor cells, drug delivery, and real-time monitoring of biological responses. A one-step oxygen plasma process was employed to tailor commercially available fluorescent polystyrene beads into a corrugated upper hemisphere and simultaneously modify the entire surface with carboxylic groups. After depositing gold onto the corrugated hemisphere for SERS (using 633 nm laser excitation) while leaving the other smooth and clean hemisphere for fluorescence detection (via 488 nm or 532 nm laser excitation), the Au-coated fluorescent nano-mushrooms (AuFNMs) are formed with dual-surfaces of plasmonic gold semishells on the top and fluorescent carboxylated polystyrene at the bottom. Based on the unique structures and the self-generated functional surfaces of the AuFNMs, sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin disulfide linkers and anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies can be simultaneously modified and added onto the top gold surfaces and the bottom carboxyl groups through Au-S and peptide bonds, respectively. The surface-modified AuFNM suspension, with >99% purity and uniform particle size in a concentration of ∼10<sup>10</sup> particles per mL in 2 mL DI water, can be employed to target overexpressive glycoproteins (CD44) on the surfaces of cancer cells and release their loads via the cleavage of disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm. These AuFNMs exhibit a 12-fold higher cancer targeting ability on HeLa cells when compared to a normal chondrocyte cell. Three-dimensional confocal particle tracking and Raman mapping are used to demonstrate the AuFNMs' long-lasting single-particle fluorescence and superior biomolecule sensing ability. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84872163391	Quantum dot 705, a cadmium-based nanoparticle, induces persistent inflammation and granuloma formation in the mouse lung	Some quantum dots (QDs) have been applied for drug delivery and imaging in biological systems. Drug delivery via the lung and lung imaging are potential applications of QDs. QD705 is cadmium based. The aims of the study were to evaluate the biological effects of QD705 in the lungs and the protective effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating against QD705-induced biological responses. Intratracheal instillation of QD705-COOH persistently induced acute neutrophil infiltration, followed by interstitial lymphocyte infiltration and a granulomatous reaction on days 17 and 90. QD705-COOH also induced gene expression of cytokines, chemokines and metalloproteinase 12 in lung tissues. Furthermore, QD705-COOH transiently reduced pulmonary function on day 17. Treatment with QD705-PEG induced similar inflammatory responses and reduced pulmonary function on day 17, but the granulomatous reaction disappeared by day 90 These data indicated that administration of QD705 via the lung caused adverse responses and PEG coating failed to prevent these effects. © Informa UK, Ltd. © 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.

84872855137	Programmable cellular retention of nanoparticles by replacing the synergistic anion of transferrin	The ability to program the intracellular retention of nanoparticles (NPs) would increase their applicability for imaging and therapeutic applications. To date, there has been no efficient method developed to control the fate of NPs once they enter cells. Existing approaches to manipulate the intracellular retention of NPs are mostly "passive" and particle size-dependent. Different sized particles hold distinct cellular responses. The adverse effect of particle size may limit the utility of nanodelivery systems. Therefore, the development of tunable/"active" NP intracellular retention systems with fixed particle sizes remains a considerable challenge. By replacing the synergistic anions of transferrin (Tf) immobilized on quantum dots (Tf-QDs, ca. 25 nm), we have examined the feasibility of this concept. Substitution of synergistic anions of Tf from carbonate (holo-Tf) to oxalate (oxa-Tf) significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of the oxa-Tf-QDs as a result of (i) a delay in cellular removal triggered by oxalate (oxa-Tf)-induced endosomal Tf iron-release retardation and (ii) enhanced recycling of Tf-QD/TfR (Tf receptor) complexes from early endosomes to the plasma membrane. This accumulation extended the intracellular NP retention interval. The half-maximum fluorescence intensity of the oxa-Tf-QDs in vivo was 4 times higher than that of the holo-Tf-QDs. Programming of the intracellular NP retention time was accomplished through manipulation of the ratio of holo- and oxa-Tfs on the surfaces of the QDs. Using this simple and efficient approach, it was possible to readily achieve a desirable intracellular retention interval for the NPs. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84873319561	Charge-selective gate of arrayed MWCNTs for ultra high-efficient biomolecule enrichment by nano-electrostatic sieving (NES)	We report a rapid and highly-efficient biomolecule preconcentrating device based on nano-electrostatic sieving (NES) mechanism that is facilitated by multi-nanofluidic channels operated in parallel. The opening of these nanochannels is regulated by tunable charges that are generated on arrayed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) gate. The NES device is fabricated by standard photolithography and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) techniques, followed by subsequent deposition of parylene (poly(p-xylylene))-C on vertically grown MWCNTs in order to obtain arrayed multi-nanochannels with mean pore sizes that are comparable to the thickness of an electrical double layer (EDL). The enrichment efficiency for charged analytes is dependent on electrostatic repulsion, which is regulated by the distribution of the local electric field on the MWCNTs gate. The NES device exhibits polarity selectivity on the analytes and performs efficient collection and separation of biomolecules by probing the surface charge density dependence on the applied gate field. A tunable gate of the parylene-MWCNT nanochannels was used as size sieving devices for nano-scale biomolecules. The experimental results for the collection of FITC-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.033nM) were as high as nearly 10

84875055465	Complete microscale profiling of tumor microangiogenesis. A microradiological methodology reveals fundamental aspects of tumor angiogenesis and yields an array of quantitative parameters for its characterization.	Complete profiling would substantially facilitate the fundamental understanding of tumor angiogenesis and of possible anti-angiogenesis cancer treatments. We developed an integrated synchrotron-based methodology with excellent performances: detection of very small vessels by high spatial resolution (~. 1. μm) and nanoparticle contrast enhancement, in vivo dynamics investigations with high temporal resolution (~. 1. ms), and three-dimensional quantitative morphology parametrization by computer tracing. The smallest (3-10. μm) microvessels were found to constitute >80% of the tumor vasculature and exhibit many structural anomalies. Practical applications are presented, including vessel microanalysis in xenografted tumors, monitoring the effects of anti-angiogenetic agents and in vivo detection of tumor vascular rheological properties. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84875055833	Very small photoluminescent gold nanoparticles for multimodality biomedical imaging	An original synthesis method based on X-ray irradiation produced gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with two important properties for biomedical research: intense visible photoluminescence and very high accumulation in cancer cells. The nanoparticles, coated with MUA (11-mercaptoundecanoid acid), are very small (1.4. nm diameter); the above two properties are not present for even slightly larger sizes. The small MUA-AuNPs are non-cytotoxic (except for very high concentrations) and do not interfere with cancer cell proliferation. Multimodality imaging using visible light fluorescence and X-ray microscopy is demonstrated by tracing the nanoparticle-loaded tumor cells. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84877938404	Cadmium-based quantum dot induced autophagy formation for cell survival via oxidative stress	Quantum dots (QDs) are one of most utilized nanomaterials in nanocrystalline semiconductors. QDs emit near-infrared fluorescence and can be applied as probes for detecting vasculature and imaging in biological systems. Since QDs have potential in clinical application, the toxicity of QDs needs to be carefully evaluated. In our present study, we elucidate the cytotoxic mechanisms of QDs using a mouse renal adenocarcinoma (RAG) cell line. QDs in RAG cells increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and induced autophagy at 6 h, leading to subsequent apoptosis at 24 h. QDs entered the cells and were located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), endosome, and lysosome at 6 h and endosome, lysosome, and mitochondria at 24 h. However, QDs only affected mitochondrial function and did not induce ER stress. N-Acetylcysteine, an antioxidant agent, reduced intracellular ROS levels and decreased QD-induced autophagy but enhanced QD-induced cell death. Moreover, 3-methylamphetamine (an autophagy inhibitor) also reduced the cell viability in QD-treated cells. These findings suggest that ROS plays an essential role in the regulation of QD-induced autophagy, which subsequently enhances cell survival. Taken together, these results suggest that oxidative stress-induced autophagy is a defense/survival mechanism against the cytotoxicity of QD. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84880035401	Involvement of MyD88 in zinc oxide nanoparticle-induced lung inflammation	Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONP) have great potential for medical applications. However, ZnONP is reported to induce acute lung inflammation, which limits its application in humans. We designed in vivo and in vitro studies to clarify ZnONP inflammation and its associated molecular signals. ZnONP with a single dose of 80μg/30μl was instilled into the tracheas of mice sacrificed at days 2, 7, 14, and 28 after instillation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed increased neutrophils and macrophages after treatment. Lung pathology showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages primarily in the bronchioles and peribronchiolar areas. Proinflammatory gene expression of TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL1, and MCP-1 was increased at day 2 and decreased after 7 days. The lung pathology resolved at day 28, without fibrosis. It remains unclear whether this acute lung inflammation was caused by ZnONP themselves or Zn

84885947379	In-situ formation and assembly of gold nanoparticles by gum Arabic as efficient photothermal agent for killing cancer cells	Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been established to sufficiently eradicate tumors by means of heat production for photothermal therapy. However, the translation of the AuNPs from bench to the clinic still remains to be solved until realizing high bioclearance after treatment. Herein, we developed a simple strategy for simultaneous formation and assembly of small-size gold nanoparticles (Au-SNPs) to form a novel nanocomposite in the presence of gum arabic (GA) by synchrotron X-ray irradiation in an aqueous solution within 5min. GA, a porous polysaccharide, can not only provide a confined space in which to produce uniform Au-SNPs (1.6±0.7nm in diameter), but can also facilitate the formation of Au-SNPs@GA (diameter ≈ 40nm) after irradiating synchrotron X-rays. Specifically, the Au-SNPs@GA possesses high thermal stability and a strong photothermal effect for killing cancer cells. Importantly, a bioclearance study demonstrated that the Au-SNPs@GA can be gradually excreted by the renal and hepatobiliary system, which might be due to the breakdown and oxidation of GA under irradiating synchrotron X-rays. Thus, the novel gold nanocomposite can be promising photothermal agents for cancer treatment at the therapeutic level, minimizing toxicity concerns regarding long-term accumulation in vivo. After synchrotron X-ray irradiation of mixtures containing gold ions and gum arabic (GA), the nucleation and growth of gold ions are confined within the inherent porous structure of GA. Additionally, uniform and small-size AuNPs are trapped in GA to assemble as an Au-SNPs@GA nanocomposite, revealing photothermal effect for efficiently killing cancer cells. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84897495549	Epstein-Barr virus BALF3 has nuclease activity and mediates mature virion production during the lytic cycle	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic replication involves complex processes, including DNA synthesis, DNA cleavage and packaging, and virion egress. These processes require many different lytic gene products, but the mechanisms of their actions remain unclear, especially for DNA cleavage and packaging. According to sequence homology analysis, EBV BALF3, encoded by the third leftward open reading frame of the BamHI-A fragment in the viral genome, is a homologue of herpes simplex virus type 1 UL28. This gene product is believed to possess the properties of a terminase, such as nucleolytic activity on newly synthesized viral DNA and translocation of unit length viral genomes into procapsids. In order to characterize EBV BALF3, the protein was produced by and purified from recombinant baculoviruses and examined in an enzymatic reaction in vitro, which determined that EBV BALF3 acts as an endonuclease and its activity is modulated by Mg

84898887269	Dysregulated interactions between lamin A and SUN1 induce abnormalities in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum in progeric laminopathies	Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a human progeroid disease caused by a point mutation on the LMNA gene. We reported previously that the accumulation of the nuclear envelope protein SUN1 contributes to HGPS nuclear aberrancies. However, the mechanism by which interactions between mutant lamin A (also known as progerin or LAD50) and SUN1 produce HGPS cellular phenotypes requires further elucidation. Using light and electron microscopy, this study demonstrated that SUN1 contributes to progerin-elicited structural changes in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network. We further identified two domains through which full-length lamin A associates with SUN1, and determined that the farnesylated cysteine within the CaaX motif of lamin A has a stronger affinity for SUN1 than does the lamin A region containing amino acids 607 to 656. Farnesylation of progerin enhanced its interaction with SUN1 and reduced SUN1 mobility, thereby promoting the aberrant recruitment of progerin to the ER membrane during postmitotic assembly of the nuclear envelope, resulting in the accumulation of SUN1 over consecutive cellular divisions. These results indicate that the dysregulated interaction of SUN1 and progerin in the ER during nuclear envelope reformation determines the progression of HGPS. © 2014.

This combo-microprobe is capable of in vivo neurochemical delivery/analysis and photoenergy transmission /detection. The combo-microprobe was implanted into anesthetized rat brains and was used to simultaneously observe the cerebral ischemiainduced increase in extracellular glutamate concentration, which was performed by the microdialysis perfusion and analysis; and the increase in blood brain barrier permeability, which was performed by the optical fibers to monitor the extravasated fluorescent nanospheres.

84916912447	Downregulation of BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 sensitizes glioma cells to temozolomide	We previously found that BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex subunit 3 (BRCC3) was highly expressed in tumorigenic rat glioma cells. However, the functional role of BRCC3 in human glioma cells remains to be characterized. This study indicated that the upregulation of BRCC3 expression was induced in two human malignant glioblastoma U251 and A172 cell lines following exposure to the alkylating agent, temozolomide (TMZ). Homologous recombination (HR)-dependent DNA repair-associated genes (i.e. BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51 and FANCD2) were also increased in U251 and A172 cells after treatment with TMZ. BRCC3 gene knockdown through lentivirus-mediated gene knockdown approach not only significantly reduced the clonogenic and migratory abilities of U251 and A172 cells, but also enhanced their sensitization to TMZ. The increase in phosphorylated H2AX foci (γH2AX) formation, an indicator of DNA damage, persisted in TMZ-treated glioma cells with stable knockdown BRCC3 expression, suggesting that BRCC3 gene deficiency is associated with DNA repair impairment. In summary, we demonstrate that by inducing DNA repair, BRCC3 renders glioma cells resistant to TMZ. The findings point to BRCC3 as a potential target for treatment of alkylating drug-resistant glioma.

13844319891	In vivo monitoring of fluorescent nanosphere delivery in anesthetized rats using an implantable fiber-optic microprobe	An implantable needle-type fiber-optic microprobe was constructed to monitor in vivo fluorescent substances in anesthetized rats. This fiber-optic microprobe was composed of coaxial optical fibers that were catheterized using a thin-wall tube of stainless steel (o.d. ∼400 μm; i.d. ∼300 μm). When the fiber-optic microprobe was placed in solutions containing various concentrations of fluorescent nanospheres (20 nm), either in the presence or in the absence of 10% Lipofundin acting as an optical phantom, we observed nanosphere concentration-dependent responses of the fluorescence intensity. The microprobe was then implanted into the livers and brains of anesthetized rats to monitor the in situ extravasation of preadministered fluorescent nanospheres from vasculature following the hepatic and cerebral ischemic insults. Both types of ischemic insults showed immediate increases in fluorescent intensities when 20-nm fluorescent nanosphere were administered, but neither ischemic insult induces such an increase when we administered 1000-nm fluorescent nanospheres. Additional experiments can be performed to further narrow the size range of the increase in blood vessel permeability following ischemic insult; such "size" information may be valuable when formulating drugs for optimal local delivery. Although a wide variety of fluorescent substances are used intensively for in vitro biological studies, the in vivo and in situ monitoring of these substances is studied much less often, probably because of difficulties in the efficient assembly of miniaturized fiber optics to detect the relatively weak fluorescence signal arising within such a turbid medium as tissue. To our knowledge, the use of our implantable fiber-optic microprobe is the first minimally invasive technique capable of investigating the "size window" of vascular permeability for the in vivo delivery of nanospheres in both ischemic livers and brains.
