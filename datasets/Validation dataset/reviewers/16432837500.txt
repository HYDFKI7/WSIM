0031835057	Application of hemin as a labeling reagent in mimetic enzyme immunoassay for hepatitis B surface antigen	A novel mimetic enzyme immunoassay method has been developed for the determination of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in solution. Hemin, a horseradish peroxidase substitute, was used as a labeling reagent to catalyze the reaction of p-hydroxyphenyl acetic (HPA) and hydrogen peroxide in alkaline medium. In the sandwich immunoassay, anti-HBsAg antibody was coated on a 96-well plate (polystyrene), which first reacted with standard HBsAg solution or HBsAg in the test blood serum and then further reacted with the fixed amount of hemin-labelled anti-HbsAg. After the two-step immunoreaction, the immunochemically adsorbed hemin-anti-HBsAg conjugate moiety was determined by measuring the fluorescence produced in a solution containing HPA and hydrogen peroxide. The fluorescence intensity was directly proportional to the concentration of HBsAg. The calibration graph for HBsAg was linear over the range 0-450 ng/well with a detection limit of 0.9 ng/well. The method is sensitive enough for the determination of HBsAg level in hepatitis B blood serum.

27544490286	Studies on the binding mode of pinacyanol chloride to nucleic acids	The interaction of pinacyanol chloride (PC) with nucleic acids has been investigated by a series of experiments. Extensive hypochromism, appreciable peak shifts, isosbestic points and new peaks of the product of binding to nucleic acids hi the spectra were observed. They showed that the interaction between PC and nucleic acids occurred. The results from absorption spectra of DNA, DNA melting, electrophoresis and fluorescence polarization studies have indicated that PC binds to DNA in nonintercalative way. Consistent with the nonintercalation, the studies of fluorescence titration and absorption titration specified that the binding of PC to nucleic acids occurred by an outside stacking binding, in which nucleic acids served for acting templates. The fact that the new absorption peaks of bound PC at ca. 485 nm are just dose to the absorption bands of H-aggregate of PC at high concentrations without DNA further supports the outside stacking binding mode. In addition, other evidence indicated that the interaction between PC and nucleic acids is not purely electrostatic.

The resulting artificial receptor has extensive applications in chromatographic stationary phases, solid phase extraction, catalysis, drug delivery and sensors. The synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) specific for proteins has been proved challenging due to a number of inherent problems in protein imprinting but potentially rewarding work.

0033850924	Characterization of the binding of methylene blue to DNA by spectroscopic methods	Methylene blue (MB) binds to the double helical DNA with a high affinity, as deduced from the absorption and fluorescence spectral data. Extensive hypochromism and red shifts in the absorption spectra were observed when MB binds to calf thymus DNA(CT DNA), which suggested the intercalation mechanism of MB into DNA bases. Upon binding to DNA, the fluorescence from MB was efficiently quenched by the DNA bases, with no shifts in the emission maximum. The large increases in the polarization upon binding to CT DNA supported the intercalation of MB into the helix. Ferrocyanide quenching studies showed that the magnitude of K(SV) of the bound MB was lower than that of the free MB. The results of competitive binding studies showed that ethidium bromide could be displaced by MB from ethidium-DNA complex. The results of all above further studies also proved the intercalation of MB into DNA base stack.

Three kinds of molecularly imprinted polymers were prepared with surface molecular imprinting technique on functionalized silica gel (F-silica gel). MIPs prepared using bonded β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) and acrylamide (AA), either separately or in combination have shown various recognition properties. The results of adsorption experiments indicated that the selectivity of MIP, which was synthesized with bonded β-CD and AA [MIP(1)], was superior to those obtained with AA [MIP(2)] or bonded β-CD [MIP(3)]. In addition, the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column packed with MIP(1) could not only separate Trp from other aromatic amino acids, but also separate the template from its enantiomer in aqueous mobile phase.

The interaction between the template molecule and the functional monomer(methacrylic acid) was evaluated by absorption spectroscopy. The permeation experiment which was carried out with the mixed solution containing template and its competitive analogue shows that the transport trend of the substances through the MIMs hardly has something to do with the supporting material. But a perfect separation will be obtained when the chosen supporting material is suitable. When the competitive analogue is smaller than the template, it preferentially transports through the MIMs because of the size effect. But when they are the same in size, the size effect doesn't work. Then the template transports faster due to its complementary functional groups and shape with the imprinted sites on the MIMs. And when the competitive analogue is bigger than the template, the facilitated transport of the template is attributed to both the size effect and its complementary functional groups and shape with the imprinted sites.

0034670399	Characterization of DNA hybridization on the optical fiber surface	Immobilized oligonucleotide has been utilized widely for the development of DNA biosensors. In this study we report the characterization of the oligonucleotide probe hybridization process on the optical fiber surface. Streptavidin was covalently linked to the core surface of a multimode optical fiber and used as a bridge for the immobilization of a thin layer of 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotide probes. Following hybridization to the 5′-fluorescein labeled target oligonucleotides in solution, the fluorescence signal generated on the optical fiber surface by laser excitation traveled back into the optical fiber core and was collected at the proximal end. With the evanescent wave excitation and detection method used, a very sharp discrimination of bulk fluorescence against surface excitation in combination with high excitation intensities could be achieved. The preliminary results showed that the hybridization process on the optical fiber surface was specific and it could identify a single base mismatch in the hybridized duplex under experimental conditions. Hybridization performance of surface immobilized oligonucleotides to various concentrations of target oligonucleotides in solution was studied. Regeneration of the optical fiber surface was possible without a significant loss of the hybridization ability. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The surface and cross-section morphology of the MIMs were studied by scanning electron microscopy. It is found that both the outer and inner surface of the Nylon membrane were coated by the sol-gel. The permeation experiments were carried out with both the single template and the double components containing the template and its competitive analogue. The results of permeation experiments show that the permeation of the template is attributed to both the size effect and its complementary functional groups and shape with the imprinted sites. The specific imprinted sites could selectively rebind the template, resulting in the slower permeation of the template. And the size effect means that the smaller the size is, the faster the template transports.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system was constructed between CdTe QDs (donor) and butyl-rhodamine B (BRB) (acceptor) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMAB). CTMAB micelles formed in water reduced the distance between the donor and the acceptor significantly and thus improved the FRET efficiency, which resulted in an obvious fluorescence enhancement of the acceptor. Several factors which impacted the fluorescence spectra of the FRET system were studied. The energy transfer efficiency (E) and the distance (r) between CdTe and BRB were obtained. The feasibility of the prepared FRET system as fluorescence probe for detecting Hg(II) in aqueous solution was demonstrated.

The interaction between APBA and BSA during the prepolymerization stage was investigated and optimized, and ideal conditions for protein rebinding experiments were determined as well. Protein rebinding and enriching properties of polymers were studied in single and competitive binding protocols, respectively. The key point of the present paper is that the binding selectivity of polymers may be estimated by the amount of bound-protein recovered from a protein-saturated polymer.

Mesoporous chloromethylated polystyrene beads (MCP beads) containing dithiocarbamate iniferter (initiator transfer agent terminator) were used as supports for the grafting of lysozyme imprinted copolymers with acrylamide and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide through surface initiated living-radical polymerization (SIP). After the polymerization, a layer of lysozyme-MIP was formed on the MCP beads. The SIP allowed an efficient control of the grafting process and suppressed solution propagation. Therefore, the obtained lysozyme-MIP beads had a large quantity of well-distributed pores on the surface without any visible gel formation in solution and were more advantageous comparing with traditional MIPs which were prepared by traditionally initiated radical polymerization. The obtained composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, nitrogen sorption analysis and scanning electron microscopy.

The produced polymers were characterized using both (1) equilibrium adsorption assays and (2) high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Results confirmed that the synthesized BSA-MIP (molecularly imprinted polymer) has a high affinity towards its template compared to the determined control proteins. The produced BSA-MIP featured largely in its good adsorption reversibility, especially in competitive binding assays, which is of great biological significance in separations. Non-specific binding was reduced to almost zero in a BSA/BHb competitive binding event. An excellent HPLC profile of template recognition was found for BSA-MIP, even under harsh mobile phase conditions. In the present work, the adopted trapped-template-release method permits recovery of bound BSA [1].

A metal chelate monomer [N-(4-vinyl)-benzyl iminodiacetic acid] forming coordination complex with the template protein in the presence of Cu ions co-polymerized with N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylamide, using N,N-methylenebisacrylamide as the cross-linker to prepare the thermosensitive protein-imprinted hydrogel. The synergetic combination of the smart property of the macroporous thermosensitive hydrogel with the merits of the coordinate interaction improved the selectivity and adsorption capacity, with respect to template lysozyme. The macropores were created by the frozen polymerization, and the influences of frozen polymerization and the chelate monomer content on the hydrogel affinity were investigated. The imprinted hydrogel can respond not only to external stimuli, but also to the template protein with a certain degree of shrinking. In recognition of the protein, the interaction of the imprinted thermosensitive hydrogel to the protein can be switched between the coordinate effect and the electrostatic effect by adding or not adding Cu ions. Finally, this imprinted hydrogel was used to purify the template lysozyme from the mixture of proteins and the real sample, which demonstrated its high selectivity. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The results of the adsorption experiments indicated that such protein imprinted polymer, which was synthesized with β-CD and acrylamide as monomers, could selectively recognize the template protein. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77956273944	Novel surface-modified molecularly imprinted membrane prepared with iniferter for permselective separation of lysozyme	A novel and efficient molecularly imprinted membrane (MIM) for the selective transport and separation of lysozyme was synthesized by the molecular imprinting technique. The layer of molecularly imprinted materials containing recognition sites for the lysozyme was formed on the poly(acrylontrile-co-. N,. N'-diethylaminodithiocarbamoylmethylstyrene) [P(AN-co-DTCS)] membrane, which was prepared via a phase inversion method and modified with photosensitive dithiocarbamate group for surface initiated living-radical polymerization. Thus obtained MIM was characterized and evaluated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and competitive transport studies. Under the optimum conditions, the transporting factor of the lysozyme reached 2.41 when the time of permeation was 24. h. The separation of the mixture of lysozyme and bovine hemoglobin and the mixture of lysozyme and cytochrome c showed that the selectivity factor (β) reached 2.51 and 2.13, respectively. All these results indicated that the excellent selectivity separation performance of the MIM for lysozyme arose from the size and structure of the imprinted sites on the MIM, which offered great potential for separation and purification in commercial applications. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78650615094	Composite of CdTe quantum dots and molecularly imprinted polymer as a sensing material for cytochrome c	A newly designed molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) material was fabricated and successfully utilized as recognition element to develop a quantum dots (QDs) based MIP-coated composite for selective recognition of the template cytochrome c (Cyt). The composites were synthesized by sol-gel reaction (imprinting process). The imprinting process resulted in an increased affinity of the composites toward the corresponding template. The fluorescence of MIP-coated QDs was stronger quenched by the template versus that of non-imprinted polymer (NIP)-coated QDs, which indicated the composites could recognize the corresponding template. The results of specific experiments further exhibited the recognition ability of the composites. Under optimum conditions, the linear range for Cyt is from 0.97μM to 24μM, and the detection limit is 0.41μM. The new composites integrated the high selectivity of molecular imprinting technology and fluorescence property of QDs and could convert the specific interactions between imprinted cavities and corresponding template to the obvious changes of fluorescence signal. Therefore, a simple and selective sensing system for protein recognition has been realized. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79251615814	A thermosensitive monolithic column as an artificial antibody for the on-line selective separation of the protein	The main objective of this study was to develop a new methodology for the preparation of a protein (antigen) that is a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP, an artificial antibody) modified onto the surface of a silica skeleton in which the resulting stationary phase is thermosensitive. The silica monolithic skeleton with vinyl groups was synthesized in a stainless-steel column by using a mild one-step sol-gel process with two types of precursor: methyltrimethoxysilane (MTMS) and γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (γ-MAPS). Subsequently, three types of the thermosensitive protein MIP were anchored onto the surface of the silica skeleton to prepare the MIP monoliths, which were systematically investigated for back pressure and separation ability at different temperatures to establish good imprinting conditions. Under the optimized imprinting conditions, the chromatographic behavior of the thermosensitive MIP monolith exhibited strong retention ability for the lysozyme template (target antigen) in relation to the nonimprinting monolith (NIP monolith). The imprinting factor (IF) for lysozyme reached 3.48 at 20°C. Moreover, this new type of artificial antibody displayed favorable binding characteristics for lysozyme over competitive proteins and was further evaluated to selectively separate lysozyme in a real sample by using an on-line method. The run-to-run and column-to-column repeatability measurements of the thermosensitive MIP monoliths were also satisfactory. Imprint and separate: Introduction of a thermosensitive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) onto a silica skeleton imprints the protein (see scheme) and separates the target protein efficiently in an on-line temperature-based approach. The notable thermosensitive MIP monolith selectively separates the template lysozyme from competitive proteins and separates a highly abundant protein (lysozyme) from chicken egg white with good selectivity and reproducibility © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

79955050938	One-pot synthesis of thermal responsive QDs-PNIPAM hybrid fluorescent microspheres by controlling the polymerization temperature at two different polymerization stages	In the present study, for the first time, without the help of any amphiphilic polymers or polymerizable surfactants, 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped CdTe quantum dots (QDs) could be one-pot copolymerized into poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microspheres during the monomer polymerization process just by controlling the synthesis temperature at two different polymerization stages. In the first stage, NIPAM monomers were initiated by potassium persulfate (KPS) below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) to form PNIPAM networks with CdTe QDs distributed throughout. In the second stage, when the polymerize temperature was raised above the LCST, the PNIPAM networks collapsed to form spheres and the CdTe QDs were entrapped into the PNIPAM microspheres (denoted as CdTe-PNIPAM microspheres). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that CdTe QDs have been successfully entrapped within the PNIPAM matrix. According to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) results, the CdTe-PNIPAM hybrid microspheres had a significantly narrow size distribution and their mean hydrodynamic diameter was about 267 nm. Compared with the original CdTe QDs, the CdTe-PNIPAM microspheres exhibited not only a prominent red-shift of their emission wavelength (as much as 36 nm), but also temperature dependent on-off fluorescence properties. Around the LCST, when the temperature was increasing, the fluorescence intensity decreased sharply; when cooling the solution, the fluorescence intensity would restore. Moreover, after repeated heating and cooling cycles, the photoluminescence (PL) quenching and enhancement processes were fully reversible around the LCST region. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

79954438072	Molecularly imprinted beads with double thermosensitive gates for selective recognition of proteins	A new approach is reported on the use of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)-coated molecularly imprinted beads (coated MIP beads) for controlling the release of protein. The coated MIP beads were composed of double layers, an internal thermosensitive lysozyme-imprinted layer, and an external PNIPAM layer. The coated MIP beads were prepared by two-step surface-initiated living-radical polymerization (SIP). In this systemic study, the coated MIP beads had good selectivity to the template protein (lysozyme) and temperature stimulus-responsive behavior, both of which were superior to those of MIP beads having a layer of thermosensitive lysozyme-imprinted polymer only. Using the coated MIP beads, reference proteins and the template lysozyme could be released separately at 38 °C and at 23 °C. The corresponding coated non-imprinted beads (coated NIP beads) did not have such double thermosensitive "gates" with specific selectivity for a particular protein. The proposed smart controlled imprinted system for protein is attractive for chemical carriers, drug-delivery system, and sensors. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

The macroporous poly(GMA-DVB) skeleton was synthesized in a 4.6 mm i.d. stainless steel column with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and divinylbenzene (DVB) as precursors. Subsequently, the molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film coating with dopamine as the functional monomer and Lyz as imprinted template was noncovalently attached to the organic skeleton. The produced Lyz-MIP monoliths were characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis and exhibited excellent chromatographic performance and recognition ability.

The approach combined the merits of molecular imprinting technology and the fluorescent property of the CdTe QDs. The dBSA was used not only to modify the surface defects of the CdTe QDs, but also as assistant monomer to create effective recognition sites. Three different proteins, namely lysozyme (Lyz), cytochrome c (Cyt) and methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA), were tested as the template molecules and then the receptors were synthesized by sol-gel reaction (imprinting process).

Firstly, 2-bromoisobutyryl bromide as the ATRP initiator was attached onto the macroporous silica via chemical reaction. In the next stage, methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (MATA) carrying strong anion exchanger groups as the monomer was polymerized on the initiator-immobilized particles via surface-initiated ATRP. After studying the adsorption properties, the suitable support was packed into stainless steel column to separate acid proteins by the linear gradient elution in 20 min at flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. The effects of flow rate, pH and organic solvents on the separation and retention ability of proteins were studied in detail. This support was also used for the separation and purification of ovalbumin from egg in only one step.

84867285871	One-pot aqueous synthesis of composition-tunable near-infrared emitting Cu-doped CdS quantum dots as fluorescence imaging probes in living cells	In the last two decades, near-infrared (NIR) emitting Cu-doped quantum dots (QDs) have stimulated stupendous research interest for their excellent optical properties. Due to the synthetic method in the organic phase, almost none of the NIR emitting Cu-doped QDs were used as the fluorescent probes for biological imaging, despite being employed for applications in many fields. In this work, we successfully synthesized water-soluble Cu-doped CdS quantum dots (Cu:CdS d-dots) with an emission wavelength at 722 nm using a fast and facile hydrothermal method. The optical properties of the d-dots and several key parameters of the synthesis conditions such as dopant concentration, reaction temperature, reflux time, and especially the pH of the reaction mixture were systematically studied, and the mechanism of these parameters is also discussed.

84875841019	Fabrication of QD-silica-Au NCs ternary hybrid sphere-based fluorescence bar codes by a post-encoding method	We fabricated QD-silica-Au NC hybrid spheres, in which the solid silica core contained QDs while the mesostructured silica shell contained Au NCs, by a two-step synthesis procedure. The hybrid spheres were further characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis to confirm the formation of the ternary hybrid structure. The as-prepared ternary hybrid spheres showed an interesting fluorescence spectrum variation and further could be developed as a precursor for fabricating multicolor fluorescence bar codes by using l-cysteine (l-Cys) as an effective post-encoding adjuster. A small variation of the concentration of l-Cys led to a prominent change of the precursor's fluorescence intensity ratio, which could correspond to a series of distinguishable multicolor fluorescent bar codes. Furthermore, the multicolour fluorescence bar codes fabricated by the post-encoding method showed excellent non-reversibility, batch-to-batch reproducibility of the intensity ratios, photophysical and thermal stability properties and anti-interference capabilities, which are important virtues for them to be used in high-throughput bio-labelling and imaging. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The as-prepared APBA-coated QDs, relying on the interaction between APBA and cis-diol containing structures, demonstrated excellent selectivity for the glycoproteins. Their high surface area and APBA-enriched silica matrixes give rise to faster binding kinetics and higher binding capacity for the glycoproteins, which further make them attractive for biomedical/chemical sensing applications. Based on the fluorescent properties of the particles, the as-prepared APBA-coated QDs were successfully applied to the fluorescence quantification of glycoproteins.

84879256896	Smart surface imprinting polymer nanospheres for selective recognition and separation of glycoprotein	Through covalent immobilization of template and surface imprinting, smart molecularly imprinted polymer nanospheres were developed for selective separation of the glycoprotein ovalbumin (OB). First, a boronic acid group-bearing poly (methyl methacrylate) (b-PMMA) nanosphere was synthesized directly at the high temperature of 70. °C. The b-PMMA nanosphere could pre-immobilize the template OB on its surface by forming reversible covalent bonds. Then the precipitation polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylamide (AAm) readily occurred on the b-PMMA nanosphere as a core at room temperature, leading to the formation of core-shell molecular imprinting nanosphere. The experiments showed the rebinding affinity of the imprinted nanospheres was thermo- and pH-dependent. The resulting imprinted nanospheres showed high adsorption capacity and good specific recognition behavior toward the template molecule, and no obvious reusability deterioration was observed. Most notably, the imprinted nanospheres reached saturated adsorption within 20. min, indicating faster rebinding kinetics. In addition, the imprinted nanospheres were successfully applied to selectively separate the target OB from an egg white sample. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84884888299	A new hydrothermal refluxing route to strong fluorescent carbon dots and its application as fluorescent imaging agent	Due to their unique optical and biochemical properties, the water-soluble fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) have attracted a lot of attention recently. Here, strong fluorescent carbon dots with excellent quality have been synthesized by the hydrothermal refluxing method using lactose as carbon source and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (i.e. Tris) as surface passivation reagent. This facile approach was simple, efficient, economical, green without pollution, and allows large-scale production of CDs without any post-treatment. TEM measurements showed that the resulting particles exhibited an average diameter of 1.5 nm. The obtained CDs possess small particle sizes, good stability in a wide range of pH values (pH 3.5-9.5), high tolerance of salt concentration, strong resistibility to photobleaching, and a fluorescent quantum yield up to 12.5%. The CDs were applied to optical bioimaging of HeLa cells, showing low cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Lysozyme as template was modified onto the surface of silica particles by a covalent method, and after polymerization and the removal of template molecules, channels through the polymer layer were formed, which allowed a single-protein molecule to come into the hollow core and attach to the binding sites inside the polymer layer. The adsorption experiments demonstrated that the hollow imprinted polymers had an extremely high binding capacity and selectivity, and thus a super-high imprinting factor was obtained. The as-prepared imprinted polymers were used to separate the template lysozyme from egg white successfully, indicating its high selectivity and potential application in the field of separation of protein from real samples. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The synthetic peptide derived from the surface-exposed C-terminus of bovine serum albumin (BSA, residues 599-607) was selected as the template molecule. The resulting EMIP film was able to selectively capture the template peptide and the corresponding target protein BSA via the recognition cavities. Based on the fluorescence quenching, the EMIP-coated QDs (molecular imprinted polymer coating CdTe QDs using epitope as the template) nanospheres were successfully applied to the direct fluorescence quantification of BSA. Compared with BMIP-coated QDs (molecular imprinted polymer coating CdTe QDs using BSA as the template), the imprinting factor and adsorption capacity of EMIP-coated QDs were greatly increased. The prepared EMIP-coated QDs can also discriminate even one mismatched sequences from the original sequences of the epitope of the BSA.

First, amino-functionalized silica nanoparticles (Si-NP) and carboxyl-terminated CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were assembled into composite nanoparticles (Si-NP/CdTe) using the EDC (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride) chemistry. Next, Si-NP/CdTe/MIP was synthesized by anchoring molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) layer on the surface of Si-NP/CdTe through the sol-gel technique and surface imprinting technique. The hybrid structure possessed the selectivity of molecular imprinting technique and the sensitivity of CdTe QDs as well as well-defined morphology. The binding experiment and fluorescence method demonstrated its special recognition performance toward the template BHb. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity of the Si-NP/CdTe/MIP decreased linearly with the increase of BHb in the concentration range 0.02-2.1 μM, and the detection limit was 9.4 nM. Moreover, the reusability and reproducibility and the successful applications in practical samples indicated the synthesis of Si-NP/CdTe/MIP provided an alternative solution for special recognition and determination of protein from real samples. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
