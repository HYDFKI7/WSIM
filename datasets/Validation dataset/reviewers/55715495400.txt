84940240988	A Plasmonic photonic diode for unidirectional focusing, imaging, and wavelength division de-multiplexing	A thin-film photonic lens is fabricated using chirped plasmonic grating structures, which enables off-axis focusing and simultaneous de-multiplexing of the incident light beams, as well as the intrinsic function of an optical lens for imaging. This planar two-dimensional photonic device may be used either as a positive (converging) or a negative (diverging) lens through controlling how the light beam is incident and how the device is oriented, which defines multifold 'diode' effects and is thus termed "forward" or "backward" biasing of such a 'diode' lens. This plasmonic photonic diode (PPD) features by unidirectional functions instead of non-reciprocal transmission. These unique functions are demonstrated by focusing different colors into different angles and different focal lengths with large dispersions, which enables direct wavelength division de-multiplexing with high resolution and high efficiency. Strong plasmonic scattering by the gold nanolines that constitute the chirped grating structures leads to efficient operation and polarization-dependent performance of the PPD device. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

34347391254	Multiphoton excited photoconductivity in polyfluorene	We investigate exciton dissociation from even- and odd-parity excited states in poly(9,9 dioctylfluorene) using multiphoton excitation of a photodiode device by femtosecond pulses with tunable photon energies. A transition from cubic to quadratic dependence of the photocurrent on the excitation intensity is observed with increasing photon energy. The cubic dependence is due to a three-photon process consisting of a two-photon absorption followed by further excitation to higher-lying states of weakly bound excitons through absorbing an extra photon. The quadratic dependence corresponds to a direct excitation to higher two-photon states of excitons that are more likely to dissociate into charge carriers. The transition from cubic to quadratic dependence between 2.05 and 2.2 eV establishes the threshold for exciton dissociation from the even-parity states between 4.1 and 4.4 eV. The efficient direct dissociation of odd-parity excitons due to single-photon excitation is observed from 4.1 to 5.5 eV. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

Using a layer of indium tin oxide underneath the gold nanowires as the waveguide, we achieved tunable polarization band-pass and band-suppression filters in the transmission and reflection configuration with a bandwidth less than 20 nm at full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the visible spectral range. Then, using side-input geometry for multiplying the absorption by the particle plasmon resonance, we achieved a strong band-suppression polarizer with an extinction ratio of up to 145. These polarization devices can be used directly in optical engineering, and potentially provide alternatives to conventional devices in some special applications.

57349132405	Tunable ultrafast optical switching via waveguided gold nanowires	Optical-excitation-induced modulation of the resonance spectrum of the plasmon polaritons was demonstrated using femtosecond transient adsorption (TA) spectroscopy. Optical-switching effects at 200 fs within a spectral bandwidth of 10 nm through coupling with the sharp waveguide mode were also observed. The results indicate that the TA signals show an optical-switching process as fast as 200 fs when evaluated at full-width at half-maximum (FWHM). The transient modulation process is interpreted as a red-shift accompanied by broadening of the resonance spectrum of the plasmon polaritons. Red-shift with broadening of the whole coupled spectrum is seen leading to positive differential signals at the leading edge and negative differential signals at the trailing edge of the spectrum. Tunability of the optical-switching effect is demonstrated when rotating the gold photonic structures in the plane of incidence about the axis parallel to the nanowires from 0° to 24°.

Compared with the reported data, the model-solid theory, which is more suitable for the studied materials, is selected to calculate the band offset. The band structures and the gain characteristics of the three different QWs are computed and compared, and the theoretical results are in good agreement with the recent experimental reports. The numerical simulation shows that the QW with the GaAs barrier has the highest absorption but the lowest peak gain, while for the AlGaAs barrier, it has the lowest absorption but the highest peak gain, and for the GaAsP barrier, it has a moderate absorption and peak gain. GaAsP is the most appropriate candidate for the barrier of InGaAs strained QW when the low-threshold, large-gain, and high-temperature characteristics are demanded simultaneously. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

We demonstrate in this paper a variety of techniques for fabricating different plasmonic nanostructures using solution-processible gold nanoparticles and differently designed annealing processes. Using interference lithography and low-(<300 °C) or high-temperature (>350 °C) annealing processes, we succeeded in fabricating high-quality one-and two-dimensional metallic photonic crystals which exhibit promising optical responses for the exploration of new optoelectronic devices. Furthermore, using direct high-temperature (>350 °C) annealing of a thin film of colloidal gold nanoparticles, we succeeded in fabricating large-area unpatterned isolated gold nano-island structures with a mean diameter tunable from about 35 to 100nm and a mean height from 20 to 70nm by controlling the concentration of the gold nanoparticle colloid, the annealing temperature, and the surface properties of the substrate. The corresponding optical response is thus tunable in the visible spectral range by changing the fabrication parameters. This introduces a new lithography-free technique for the preparation of gold nanostructures.

By controlling the excitation wavelength, the energy transfer can be optimized, which favors the formation of the exciplex on the interface between the two blend phases. Furthermore, changing the composite ratio acutally modifies the mophorlogy of the blend film, modifying the excited states on the interface and giving the microscopic insights into the mechanisms of the exciplex emission.

74849113583	Charge recombination and exciton annihilation reactions in conjugated polymer blends	Bimolecular interactions between excitations in conjugated polymer thin films are important because they influence the efficiency of many optoelectronic devices that require high excitation densities. Using time - resolved optical spectroscopy, we measure the bimolecular interactions of charges, singlet excitons, and triplet excitons in intimately mixed polyfluorene blends with band-edge offsets optimized for photoinduced electron transfer. Bimolecular charge recombination and triplet - triplet annihilation are negligible, but exciton-charge interactions are efficient. The annihilation of singlet excitons by charges occurs on picosecond time-scales and reaches a rate equivalent to that of charge transfer. Triplet exciton annihilation by charges occurs on nanosecond time-scales. The surprising absence of nongeminate charge recombination is shown to be due to the limited mobility of charge carriers at the heterojunction. Therefore, extremely high densities of charge pairs can be maintained in the blend. The absence of triplet - triplet annihilation is a consequence of restricted triplet diffusion in the blend morphology. We suggest that the rate and nature of bimolecular interactions are determined by the stochastic excitation distribution in the polymer blend and the limited connectivity between the polymer domains. A model based on these assumptions quantitatively explains the effects. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding bimolecular recombination and annihilation processes in nanostructured materials. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

According to theoretical model of suppressing Q-switched mode locking and combining with LD-pumped all-solid-state Yb:YAG laser, the reflectivity of SESAM and the critical pump power of suppressing Q-switched mode locking have been studied by numerical simulated calculations under the conditions of different modulation depths, non-saturable losses, saturation fluences, transmittance of the output mirror and other parameters. When the incident pulse fluences on the SESAM are the same, modulation depth, non-saturable loss and saturation fluence have inverse relations with SESAM reflectivity. With the decrease of modulation depth, saturation fluence, transmittance of the output mirror, beam waist and cavity length, the critical pump power also decreases, and suppressing Q-switched mode locking becomes easier. When the crystal length is 1.9 mm, the minimum critical pump power can be obtained.

This is defined as interference ablation, where the colloidal gold nanoparticles illuminated by the bright interference fringes are removed instantly within a timescale of about 6 ns, which is actually the pulse length of the UV laser, whereas the gold nanoparticles located within the dark interference fringes remain on the substrate and form grating structures. This kind of ablation has been proven to have a high spatial resolution and thus enables successful fabrication of waveguided MPC structures with the optical response in the visible spectral range. The subsequent annealing process transforms the grating structures consisting of ligand-covered gold nanoparticles into plasmonic MPCs. The annealing temperature is optimized to a range from 250 to 300 °C to produce MPCs of gold nanowires with a period of 300nm and an effective area of 5mm in diameter. If the sample of the spin-coated gold nanoparticles is rotated by 90° after the first exposure, true two-dimensional plasmonic MPCs are produced through a second exposure to the interference pattern. Strong plasmonic resonance and its coupling with the photonic modes of the waveguided MPCs verifies the success of this new fabrication technique. This is the simplest and most efficient technique so far for the construction of large-area MPC devices, which enables true mass fabrication of plasmonic devices with high reproducibility and high success rate. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In such structures, the higher-order diffracted beams can also couple into the waveguide, while in the structure that the period of grating is much smaller than the wavelength of incident light, only the ±1 orders of diffraction can excite the propagation modes of the waveguide. Numerical calculations of extinction of the higher-order structure show that except for the extinction peaks, enhanced transmission can also be obtained, which is also observed in experiment. Further simulations indicate that the enhancement can be tuned by changing the structural and the geometric parameters of the WGS device. In addition, the wavelength that extraordinary transmit is decided by the duty cycles of the gratings, so, the enhancement might be attributed to the phenomena of missing order in gratings with large period. © EDP Sciences, 2011.

80054988334	Hybrid metallic photonic crystals with higher-order coupling processes	Hybrid metallic photonic crystals (MPCs) combine the orderly arranged grating structures and the disordered gold nanostructures, where the gratings are fabricated by interference lithography on a layer of waveguide and the isolated gold nanoislands arranged randomly in the grating grooves are produced using solution-processible gold nanoparticles. Strong coupling between multiple higher-order resonance modes of the waveguide grating structures and particle plasmon resonance of the isolated gold nanoislands has been observed in the visible spectral range. This technique actually realizes fabrication of the waveguide grating structures and the plasmonic gold nanostructures separately. In this way, the plasmonic resonance of the gold nanostructures is not determined by the dimensions of the grating lines anymore. Thus, the grating structures can be fabricated easily with a period of microns, whereas the size of the gold nanostructures can be controlled flexibly by changing the colloidal concentration and the annealing temperature. Large grating period leads to higher-order coupled modes in the visible. This contributes to the family of the MPC fabrication techniques and lowers significantly the rigorous requirements on fabrication method of the large-area nanoscale MPCs. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Because there are several different initial conditions used in the finite-difference method with different repetition rates, some methods were presented to determine the initial conditions. The relationship of the peak powers of the high repetition rates with their equivalent continuous wave powers was also discussed when the signal light was in Gaussian shape. The change of the average output power with the pump power was obtained under the conditions of the pulsed signals with low repetition rates and high repetition rates.

Excellent overlap of the plasmonic resonance of the gold nanoislands with the photoluminescence spectrum of the dye molecules and the strong confinement mechanism provided by the active waveguide layer are the key essentials for the narrow-band and low-threshold operation of this random laser. This kind of feedback configuration potentially enables directional output from such random lasers.

81555229428	A biosensor based on metallic photonic crystals for the detection of specific bioreactions	An optical biosensor based on waveguided metallic photonic crystals (MPCs) is reported for the sensitive testing of biomolecular interactions, which provides practical approaches for the label-free detection of specific bioreactions. The enhancement of the sensitivity or the amplification of the sensor signal by the coupling between the waveguide resonance mode and particle-plasmon resonance (PPR) breaks through the "bottle-neck" of the intrinsic response sensitivity defined by the spectral shift of the PPR. The success of this sensor is demonstrated by sensing the specific reaction between the HIV-1 capsid protein (p24) antigen and the monoclonal anti-p24 antibody, where the dynamics of the bioreactions can be recorded with a potentially high time resolution. This new sensor stands out due to its compact design and its new physics, compared with conventional devices, its simple operation, the simple fabrication of the MPC chip and the low cost of the whole system. A new optical biosensor using waveguided metallic photonic crystals is demonstrated by the sensitive testing of the immunoreaction between the HIV-1 capsid protein (p24) antigen and the monoclonal anti-p24 antibody. An enhancement of the response sensitivity of particle-plasmon resonance and the amplification of the sensor signal have been achieved by coupling between the photonic and plasmonic resonance modes.

The sensing function of this miniaturized device is realized by sending white light as a probe to the gold rings and collecting the response signal in the back-reflection through the optical fiber. A pronounced peak due to the Rayleigh anomaly of the gold ring grating is observed in the reflection spectrum, the center wavelength of which is sensitive to the change in the environmental refractive index of the fiber end facet. Theoretical analysis not only shows excellent agreement with the experimental results, but also gives insights into the mechanisms of this kind of sensor. Using the center position of the Rayleigh peak as the response signal, a high sensitivity ddn of 900 nm per unity refractive index is realized for this sensor and a resolution of Δn/n ≈ 1% is demonstrated in preliminary experiments.

In the fabrication, photoresist is firstly spin-coated onto the glass substrate that is coated with a layer of indium tin oxide as thick as 200 nm. Grating structures are then produced by interference lithography into the photoresist. Through controlling the exposure dose and the development time, small duty cycles are achieved with the photoresist gratings. Thereafter, colloidal gold nanoparticles are spin-coated onto the photoresist master grating. Making use of the dewetting properties of the colloidal solution on the photoresist surface, very limited amount of gold nanoparticles remain on the photoresist grating and are confined into the grating grooves. In combination with the small duty cycle of the photoresist grating structures, this mechanism enables realization of narrow gold nanowires. In the final stage of the fabrication, the sample is heated to 250°C for about 5 minutes.

84863155440	Heterojunction structure forming in the polymer film doped with small-molecule organic semiconductors	Blends and doping of organic semiconductors are generally employed to improve effectively the charge transfer and dissociation performance. The absorption spectrum may be optimized making use of the different energy states of the components in the blends, which may favor the development of the photovoltaic or solar cell devices. Excellent type-II heterojunction structures can be produced by mixing the small-molecule perylene (EPPTC) and a copolymer of polyfluorene (F8BT). Actually, F8BT and EPPTC exhibit absorptions in the blue region and in the green region, respectively. Thus, the blend will have a much broadened absorption spectrum. In the experiment, the blend solution of these two materials in chloroform is spin-coated onto a piece of glass substrate, so that EPPTC is doped into the polymer of F8BT and the heterojunction structure forms in the final solid film. Then, steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as the transient photoluminesence spectroscopy (time-correlated single-photon counting), is used to investigate the formation and the photoluminescence properties of exciplex in the heterojunction film of F8BT doped with EPPTC. The photoluminscence (PL) spectrum and the life-time are measured to characterize the exciplex in the blend film, where the longer life-time of the red-shifted PL spectrum confirms the formation of the exciplex. This provides various experimental data for understanding the formation and the photophysical properties of the heterojunction structures in organic semiconductor blends. Futhermore, the absorption of the blend film covers a large range of the visible spectrum. Therefore, this kind of doping of organic semiconductor is important for the development of photovoltaic and solar cell devices. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

And all grating structures are fabricated though interference lithography or interference ablation. It is found that the AWGS design has advantages over the other two. The continuous and high-quality active waveguide in the AWGS enables low-threshold (115 μJ/cm2) laser emission with narrow linewidth (~0.4 nm at full-width at half-maximum).

84869460305	Influence of plasmonic light-scattering by gold nano-island structures on the quantum efficiency of organic solar cells	Gold nano-island structures were fabricated on the light-illumination side of an organic solar cell device to investigate how the light scattering by localized surface plasmon resonance influences the quantum efficiency of an organic solar cell. A light beam from a solar simulator experiences multiple interaction processes with the gold nanostructures before reaching the organic active material, which may include the scattering, the reflection, and the absorption by the gold nano-islands. However, only the scattering process may partially contribute to the enhancement of the conversion efficiency. The reflection and absorption processes make the gold nanostructures act as "blockers" and prevent the light from reaching the solar cell device. Even the scattering process may not always play positive roles in improving the performance of the device. Thus, experimental studies in this work intend to find out a balance between the loss and the enhancement mechanisms, so that the efficiency of the solar cell can be improved. Our experimental results found a possibly optimized configuration of the gold nano-island structures, which leads to enhancement of the conversion efficiency of the solar cell device. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84869155430	Effect of annealing temperature on the crystallization and spectroscopic response of a small-molecule semiconductor doped in polymer film	The crystallization properties of the perylene (EPPTC) molecules doped in the solid film of the derivative of polyfluorene (F8BT) at different annealing temperatures, as well as the consequently induced spectroscopic response of the exciplex emission in the heterojunction structures, were studied in the present paper. Experimental results showed that the phase separation between the small and the polymer molecules in the blend film is enhanced with increasing the annealing temperature, which leads to the crystallization of the EPPTC molecules due to the strong π-π stacking. The size of the crystal phase increases with increasing the annealing temperature. However, this process weakens the mechanisms of the heterojunction configuration, thus, the total interfacial area between the small and the polymer molecules and the amount of exciplex are reduced significantly in the blend film. Meanwhile, the energy transfer from the polymer to the small molecules is also reduced. As a result, the emission from the exciplex becomes weaker with increasing the annealing temperature, whereas the stronger emission from the polymer molecules and from the crystal phase of the small molecules can be observed. These experimental results are very important for understanding and tailoring the organic heterojunction structures. Furthermore, this provides photophysics for improving the performance of photovoltaic or solar cell devices.

An angular emission model of the relationship between the DFB cavity and its angular emission spectra is proposed. In the model, the DFB cavity can be decomposed into two parts: a grating and an active waveguide layer. So, the angular emission spectra of the DFB cavity are mainly determined by the period of the grating, the thickness of the waveguide and the material absorption during the feedback process. The theoretical model agrees well with the experimental results. It provides a convenient estimate for designing more efficient DFB polymer lasers and highly directional emission devices. © 2012 Chinese Optics Letters.

84875622807	Effects of structural perturbation on the optical properties of waveguide grating structures	In the waveguide grating structures (WGS), strong resonance between the diffraction waves and waveguide modes will result in a narrow peak in the extinction spectrum. In this article, a plane-wave transfer matrix method is used to investigate quantitatively the influence of the perturbation in the structural parameters on the narrow-band optical response of the WGS. These parameters include the modulation depth and the duty cycle of the grating structures, the thickness of the uniform intermediate layer between the waveguide and the grating structures. Numerical results and theoretical analyses indicate that the adjustment of the tuning range of the resonant signals can be realized by optimizing the relevant parameters. For example, the resonant signal shifts to longer wavelengths with increasing the modulation depth or the duty cycle of the grating. The intermediate layer between the grating and waveguide will results in multiple resonant modes in the extinction spectra and all of these signals shift to the longer wavelengths with increasing this extra layer. These results can be used as a guidance for the applications of the WGS and is important for the applications of the WGS or the waveguided metallic grating structures in sensors and optical switch. © 2012 SPIE.

Charge transfer (CT) complex is resolved from the spectroscopic response of the blend film, which is generated only when the PFO molecules are excited. Thus, the PFO molecules are specified as donors and the H-aggregated EPPTC as acceptors in the formation of CT state (CTS). The emission resulting from the CTS in the red is further recognized by its much longer lifetime than both the intrinsic emission of the individual EPPTC molecules and that of their pure aggregates. Near-field analysis verifies that the CTS form on the boundary between the PFO and the crystal phases. The CT exciton forms by bounding the hole left on HOMO of the donor (PFO) and the indirectly transferred electron to the H-aggregate state of EPPTC, which transits back to the ground state by emitting a photon at about 650 nm. This introduces special physics in the heterojunctions that are coupled with the H-aggregates and mechanisms important for the design of organic photovoltaic devices. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The peak external quantum efficiency is optimum for a PFB:F8BT ratio of 3:1. The difference of peak efficiency for this composition and a 1:1 ratio is significantly higher than the reported yield of charge-transfer excitons. From a surface topography analysis, we believe that charge percolation plays a crucial role in photocurrent efficiency in PFB:F8BT diodes.

84886427069	Laser-induced selective crosslinking for scaling the heterointerfacial domain in polymer blends	Organic blends containing heterojunction structures at the interfacial phase have been applied extensively in organic optoelectronic devices to modify charge transfer, separation, and recombination processes. Scaling and controlling the transition domains at the hetero-interface are of crucial importance for deep insights into the involved physics and for architecturing the devices with improved performance. However, it is difficult to recognize and characterize these transition domains directly using the conventional microscopic techniques, in particular when different molecules are dissolved in the same solvent with equal solubility. In this work, we introduce a technique defined as laser-induced selective cross-linking to isolate the interfacial phase from other phases into a directly measurable practicity. Thus, the hetero-domains become visualized and directly measurable. Based on the insolubility of the selectively cross-linked molecules in organic solvents, a lift-off process may remove the uncross-linked or incompletely cross-linked molecules, so that the hetero-domain is more clearly visualized and more precisely measured. A transition domain in a scale of about 200 nm is resolved in the F8BT/PFB blend film between their respectively rich phases after the selective cross-linking of the F8BT molecules by a blue laser. Furthermore, hetero-crosslinking between F8BT and PFB molecules was also resolved by both microscopic and near-field spectroscopic investigations. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

The resultant thin-film device not only possesses the fundamental functions of an optical lens for laser beam focusing, but also shows diode effects with the focusing/defocusing function dependent on the direction of light incidence and orientation of the device. Furthermore, this photonic thin-film lens exhibits a spatially tunable spectroscopic response, revealing a unique physics of secondary excitations of resonance modes of the single-layer LCP waveguide grating structures. This reveals the mechanisms for the focusing/defocusing of laser beams by chirped grating structures. Erasability and reconstructibility of the photoresponsive LCPs guarantee rewritability of the thin-film diode lens. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84898661785	Nanoscale heat transfer in direct nanopatterning into gold films by a nanosecond laser pulse	We investigate nanoscale heat transfer and heat-flux overlapping effects in nanopatterning through interactions between interferogram produced by 5-ns laser pulses at 355 nm and gold films. These mechanisms played different roles in direct writing of gold nanolines with different periods. Continuous gold nanolines were produced for large periods, where heat-flux overlapping is too small to effect the laser-metal interactions. Thus, the heat-transfer distance and direct laser-ablation determined the width of resultant gold nanolines. However, gold nanolines consisting of isolated gold nanoparticles were produced for small periods, where the overlapped heat-flux exceeds the threshold for removing or melting gold films. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84904702536	Controllable plasmonic transfer through laser-induced nanostructuring	Metallic nanoparticles with controllable plasmonic properties were fabricated by a laser-induced transfer technique. By controlling the laser fluence and the number of laser pulses, nanostructures with complementary plasmonic properties were produced. The plasmonic properties of the nanostructures were controllably modified by changing the number of irradiation pulses. This technique not only manipulates the plasmonic response of metallic nanoparticles but also facilitates the versatile transfer of metallic nanostructures onto fiber tips and stretchable substrates. This reproducible method is fast, inexpensive, flexible, and suitable for various applications for plasmonic devices. © 2014 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

84906875801	Photoconductive organic crystals grown on planar substrates with electrode effects	Organic polycrystalline fibers were grown onto planar substrates from solution of N,N-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4,9,10-perylenebis(dicarboximide) (EPPTC) in chloroform through π-stacking. Devices with excellent photoconductivity have been achieved by depositing aluminum electrodes on the top surface of the crystal fibers with a gap width as large as 180 μm. This implies excellent π-stacking of EPPTC molecules in a long range through crystallization. Strong excitation-wavelength dependence was observed for the photoconductive performance of these crystal fibers. Dispersion in the transmission spectrum of the aluminum electrodes is taken as the mechanisms to address the wavelength-dependent photoconductivity of EPPTC polycrystalline fibers. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84907484535	Flexible interference ablation using fibers to split and deliver laser pulses for direct plasmonic nanopatterning	Optical fibers are used to achieve a flexible interference ablation scheme, where the bundled end of fibers functions as a beam splitter and the fibers are used to deliver 5-ns ultraviolet laser pulses at 355nm. The divergent beams from the free ends of fibers are overlapped onto the film of colloidal gold nanoparticles. A single-pulse single-shot exposure process leads to removal of the gold nanoparticles within the bright interference fringes. Gold nanogratings are produced on glass substrates coated with indium tin oxide after an annealing process at 400°C. Fano coupling between plasmon and waveguide resonance modes was observed.

84908032072	Direct writing of flexible bimetallic nanoparticles for hybrid plasmon response	Two types of bimetallic nanoparticle are constructed on soft substrates via a laser-induced transfer technique. One particle is a physical mixture with distinct gold and silver nanoparticles, while the other is a gold-silver alloy nanoparticle. Different hybrid plasmon responses can be achieved by these nanoparticles, which can be attributed to electromagnetic interactions between gold and silver. Both nanostructures can be fabricated using one or two ultraviolet laser pulses. Also, the stability of the spectra of these nanoparticles remains robust when the substrate is stretched and bended. These particles may provide an alternative way to investigate plasmonic sensors and random laser devices.

84908042048	Stretchable polymeric modulator for intracavity spectroscopic broadening of femtosecond optical parametric oscillators	We investigate stretching-induced microscopic deformations spatially distributed in a flexible plate of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and their applications in the broadening of the output spectrum of a femtosecond optical parametric oscillator. The hologram of the stretched PDMS plate was used to evaluate indirectly the microscopic deformations. The experimental results show that these deformations exhibit weak scattering and diffraction of light and induce negligible cavity loss, ensuring practical applications of the PDMS plate as an intracavity device for lasers. In combination with the thickness reduction of the PDMS plate through stretching, the distributed deformations enable smooth tuning of the output spectrum.

84922880658	Plasmonic nanostructuring through direct laser interference patterning	Direct writing of plasmonic nanostructures is demonstrated by nanoscale-tensile-stress induced patterning through interference crosslinking in a polymer film and by single-pulse interference ablation of a gold film. Nanoscale-tensilestress from the interference crosslinking of polymer films which are exposed to the interference pattern of UV laser beams stretches evaporated gold films and induces pattern transfer from polymer into gold nanostructures. Instead, plasmonic nanostructures can be directly patterned by the interference ablation. Being exposed to the interference pattern of an UV laser pulse, the gold is directly removed within the bright interference fringes, producing periodically arranged plasmonic nanostructures.
