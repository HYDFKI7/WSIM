84927804355	Effects of compound bioflocculant on coagulation performance and floc properties for dye removal	A series of jar tests was conducted to investigate the coagulation performance of using compound bioflocculant (CBF) as a coagulant aid with aluminum sulfate (AS) and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) in synthetic dyeing wastewater treatment. Floc size, growth, breakage, re-growth and sedimentation natural were investigated by PDA2000. The results showed that the corresponding dual-coagulants of AS and PAC enhanced the color removal efficiency, especially at low aluminum dosage. Results also indicated that the floc generated by aluminum salts and CBF had larger size and higher growth rate. In addition, for both AS and PAC the floc recoverability was improved by addition of CBF. The adsorption and bridging effect of CBF performed a positive role in dye wastewater treatment.

84937861413	Practical Framework for Evaluating the Internationalization of Top Construction Firms	Chinese top international contractors are playing an increasingly significant role in the global construction market. However, due to the complicated and multifaceted nature of internationalization, there is no consensus on how to evaluate the degree of internationalization for top construction firms (TCFs). This paper is therefore aimed at building an indicator system to evaluate the internationalization degree of TCFs. Nine measures under four dimensions (ownership advantages, internationalization advantages, diversification, and internationalization speed) are identified from literature review and documentary analysis. A questionnaire survey is then conducted to investigate the weights of the indicators. Lastly, a comparative study of TCFs in China and Europe is conducted based on which shortcomings of internationalization strategies of Chinese TCFs in different aspects are identified. Suggestions are made to accelerate their internationalization process. This paper attempts to provide an effective basis for benchmarking the internationalization of TCFs and make useful recommendations for TCFs in China.

Objective: To investigate the transplantation effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells at different gestational age with different HLA-G expression levels on myocardium revascularization after myocardial infarction in rabbits. Methods: Thirty healthy New Zealand rabbits were selected and were randomly divided into human small gestational age umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation group, human full-term umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation group and control group. After the rabbits models of acute myocardial infarction had been established, the former two groups were infused different umbilical cord-derived human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells labeled with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine into the edge and center of myocardial infarct region by multipoint injection. Rabbits in the control group were subjected to an equal volume of serum-free culture medium. Results And Conclusion: Four weeks after cell transplantation, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine-positive cells were found surrounding the infarct site in both transplantation groups. Myocardial fibrosis and myocardial infarct size were significantly lower in both transplantation groups than those of the control group (P < 0.05), and there was a significant difference between the two transplantation groups (P < 0.01). The positive staining of factor VII indicated that capillary density was increased significantly in the small gestational age umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation group as compared with the full-term umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells transplantation group (P < 0.01), and a sstatistical difference was found between two transplantation groups and the control group (P < 0.01). Transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells with high HLA-G expression increases new capillary vessels and improves myocardium revascularization. All indicate that human small gestational age umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to become the better source of cardiomyocytes transplantation.

84940346863	Therapeutic applications of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in Parkinson's disease	Background: Animal experiments have repeatedly verified that umbilical cord stem cell transplantation can improve the rotational behavior of rats with Parkinson's disease, with lower immune rejection response. Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Methods: Fifteen patients with Parkinson's disease were enrolled, including 8 males and 7 females, aged 52-76 years. Hoehn & Yahr staging was 3-5. After informed consent was obtained from puerperae and the procedure was approved by the hospital ethics committee, full-term maternal umbilical cord was aseptically collected, to culture umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells. All patients were hospitalized, and treated with human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation via carotid artery puncture. Neurological function of patients was assessed using a comprehensive rating scale for Parkinson's disease before and 1 month after cells transplantation. Higher score indicated more severe neurological deficits. Results and Conclusion: Fifteen patients entered the result analysis. Compared with before transplantation, 15 patients showed significantly lowered scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale at 1 month after transplantation (P < 0.05). The improvement was mainly concentrated in the tremor and rigidity, but bradykinesia and unstable position were not improved. Graft versus host disease did not occur in all 15 cases. These findings indicate that umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cell transplantation for treating Parkinson's disease has obvious curative effects and significantly improves neurological functions.

84940357180	Expression of specific genes of cardiomyocytes differentiated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells	BACKGROUND: Intramyocardial transplantation of autologous umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells for repair of myocardial tissue damage is paid increasing attention in the cardiovascular field. OBJECTIVE: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were isolated and cultured. Passage 2 human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were treated with various concentratins of 5-azacytidine (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μmol/L) for 24 hours. After removal of 5-azacytidine, cells were cultured for another 4 weeks. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Before 5-azacytidine treatment, filament-like structures or particles were not observed in the cells, but the amount of cytoplasm was less and uniform, nuclear/cytoplasm ratio was high, cells exhibited typical fusiform appearance and grew in a swirl-like manner, and nucleolus was obvious. After treatment with 5-azacytidine for 24 hours, some cells died in each group, and typical fusiform appearance turned into stick-like or column-like appearance, especially in the 40 and 80 μmol/L 5-azacytidine groups. Reverse transcription-PCR results showed that atrial natriuretic peptide and α-skeletal actin gene expression levels were detected on human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells after treatment with 2.5 or 40 μmol/L 5-azacytidine for 4 weeks or with 5, 10, 20 μmol/L 5-azacytidine for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks. These findings suggest that 5-azacytidine-induced human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells express the specific gene of myocardiocytes.

84940638935	Long-term exposure to high altitude affects voluntary spatial attention at early and late processing stages	The neurocognitive basis of the effect of long-term high altitude exposure on voluntary attention is unclear. Using event related potentials, the high altitude group (people born in low altitude but who had lived at high altitude for 3 years) and the low altitude group (living in low altitude only) were investigated using a voluntary spatial attention discrimination task under high and low perceptual load conditions. The high altitude group responded slower than the low altitude group, while bilateral N1 activity was found only in the high altitude group. The P3 amplitude was smaller in the high altitude compared to the low altitude group only under high perceptual load. These results suggest that long-term exposure to high altitudes causes hemispheric compensation during discrimination processes at early processing stages and reduces attentional resources at late processing stages. In addition, the effect of altitude during the late stage is affected by perceptual load.

84940316771	Tissue engineering tumor based on three-dimensional culture: Research advances	The role of the microenvironment during the initiation and progression of carcinogenesis is considered to be of critical importance. The local microenvironment provides chemical, physical, and biological barriers that will determine the fate and sequelae of malignant tumor. Besides the adaptation and utilization of the microenvironment, tumor cells generally build up reprogramming of both structure and function of microenvironment. However, the traditional 2D culture model and in vivo animal models could not accurately mimetic the complicated biological events of the reciprocal interactions between tumor and microenvironment. Applying tissue-engineering concepts and approaches in this field could bridge the gap between 2D studies and in vivo animal models. The novel in vitro model based on 3D cell culture could bioengineer the in vivo growth of tumor and will be an important alternative to tumor investigation approaches. Here we review current advances in the field of 3D-modeling bioengineered tumors in vitro, with special reference to basic research and their potential applications.

The resulting high adsorption rate and alkaline solution (pH = 7-11) effect indicated a strong electrostatic interaction between the clay particles and EPI-DMA molecules. Addition of salt can also influence the adsorption of EPI-DMA onto bentonite by affecting the clay particle sizes, the polymer zeta potential and etc. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models were employed and fit the experimental data well in the low EPI-DMA concentration range 0.5-5.0 mg L

The effect of coagulant dosage and pH of dye water on the color removal was examined. And the color removal results treated by the composite coagulant (PFC-PDMDAAC) were compared with those treated by PFC, PDMDAAC and PFC followed by PDMDAAC (PFC/PDMDAAC), respectively. The following results are discovered. Synergy between PFC and PDMDAAC increases zeta potential of PFC-PDMDAAC and reduces the effect of pH on zeta potential and Fe(III) species of PFC-PDMDAAC. Treatment with PFC-PDMDAAC is very effective in removing disperse blue HGL (98%) and reactive blue STE (86%). And small changes in the color removal efficiency of PFC-PDMDAAC are observed in all pH range. The color removal efficiency for disperse blue HGL and reactive blue STE is higher than 96% and 98% in the pH range 7.5-10.5, respectively. Furthermore, PFC-PDMDAAC is shown to be more effective in removing dye than that of PFC/PDMDAAC. Finally, the treatment of the actual textile wastewater has shown that PFC-PDMDAAC is a more effective coagulant. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

39749089940	Synthesis of polyamine flocculants and their potential use in treating dye wastewater	Polyamine flocculants were synthesized by the polycondensation of dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin, in which organic amines, e.g. 1,2-diaminoethane, were used as modifying agents. Different products were obtained by varying the reaction parameters, such as the molar ratio of epichlorohydrin to dimethylamine, the amount of 1,2-diaminoethane and reaction temperature. The polyamine flocculants were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Their flocculation performance was evaluated with simulated dye liquor and actual printing and dyeing wastewater. The behavior of the flocculants was compared with that of inorganic coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The experimental results show that polyamine with the highest viscosity and cationicity could be prepared under following conditions: an epichlorohydrin to dimethylamine molar ratio of 1.5, a reaction temperature of 70 °C, a 3% content of 1,2-diaminoethane in the total reaction monomers and a reaction time of 7 h. Polyamine polymers can, as flocculants for treating simulated and actual dye wastewater, remove color and COD efficiently. The rate of color removal from reactive red liquor, reactive blue liquor and reductive yellow liquor reached as high as 96%, 97% and 96%, respectively. The highest efficiency of color removal and COD removal from polyamine for treating dye wastewater was 90% and 89%, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

59349093002	Comparison of coagulation behavior and floc structure characteristic of different polyferric-cationic polymer dual-coagulants in humic acid solution	Three polyferric-cationic polymer dual-coagulants were comparatively evaluated in terms of coagulation behavior and floc structure characteristic in the coagulation of humic acid (HA) solution. The first dual-coagulant, PFC-PDADMAC, was prepared by premixing of polyferric chloride (PFC) and polydiallyldimethylammonium (PDADMAC) before dosing. The other two were achieved by dosing PFC and PDADMAC in different order. For the given neutral condition, all three dual-coagulants gave similar HA removal before reaching optimal dosage. The strongest charge neutralization and narrowest effective coagulation dosage range were obtained when PFC was dosed firstly. While the weakest charge neutralization and the broadest effective coagulation dosage were obtained when PDADMAC was used as the primary coagulant. The HA removal of all three dual-coagulants was slightly pH dependent for optimum coagulant doses. Fe(III) hydrolysis species distributions of the dual-coagulants in coagulation process were measured by ferron method. PFC-PDADMAC gave the highest content of active Fe(III) coagulating species which is responsible for the coagulation performance of ferric coagulant.

This study investigated the feasibility and potential of using inorganic-organic composite coagulant in the coagulation-ultrafiltration system for natural organic matter (NOM) removal. The removal efficiency and membrane fouling were studied at different coagulation conditions. And in order to observe how inorganic-organic composite coagulant affects the permeate flux, a resistance analysis was conducted. The results suggest that although the treated water quality in a composite coagulant system was not improved significantly, composite coagulant was more advantageous in terms of improving the permeate flux of the coagulation-ultrafiltration system than inorganic coagulant by reducing the resistance due to cake formation and adsorption. The coagulation conditions of composite coagulant are important for the performance of the coagulation-ultrafiltration system. When dosage is 3 mg L

Results showed that AS-CBF dual coagulant was more efficient for HA removal. The floc formation, breakage and reformation were investigated under different dosages and shear rates. Increasing coagulant dosage resulted in the increase of floc growth rate and size. But the floc recoverability was found to decrease with increasing coagulant dosage. Furthermore, flocs formed by AS-CBF (AS dosed firstly) had faster growth rate, larger size and better recoverability than AS and CBF-AS (CBF dosed firstly) in the dosage range investigated. Similar results were obtained when the shear force was changed. Precipitate charge neutralization was a dominant mechanism of AS, and CBF had good adsorption bridging effect. Due to the combination of two advantages, coagulation efficiency could be enhanced significantly. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of resin widths on column adsorption was first evaluated and then a stratification-packed column with different widths of resins was applied. The nitrate uptakes by different bed depth (3.6, 5.6 and 9.8. cm) of stratified columns were 35.3, 28.1 and 23.2. mg/g, respectively. The better performance for this stratified column was observed at neutral condition, and marginally decreased with pH variation on both acidic and basic sides. The nitrate adsorption capacity was optimum at lower flow rates. In addition, Adams-Bohart and Thomas models were applied for analyzing all these parameters. The results showed that the Thomas model was suitable for the description of breakthrough curve at all experimental conditions, while Adams-Bohart model was only for an initial part of dynamic behavior of the column. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84925946580	Therapies for children with cerebral palsy: A web of science-based literature analysis	OBJECTIVE: To identify global research trends in three therapies for children with cerebral palsy. DATA RETRIEVAL: We performed a bibliometric analysis of studies on therapies for children with cerebral palsy from 2002 to 2011 retrieved from Web of Science. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria: (a) peer-reviewed published articles on botulinum toxin, constraint-induced movement therapy, or acupuncture for children with cerebral palsy indexed in Web of Science; (b) original research articles, reviews, meeting abstracts, proceedings papers, book chapters, editorial material, and news items; and (c) publication between 2002 and 2011. Exclusion criteria: (a) articles that required manual searching or telephone access; (b) documents that were not published in the public domain; and (c) a number of corrected papers from the total number of articles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Number of publications on the three therapies; (2) annual publication output, distribution by journals, distribution by institution, and top-cited articles on botulinum toxin; (3) annual publication output, distribution by journal, distribution by institution, and top-cited articles on constraint-induced movement therapy; (4) annual publication, distribution by journal, distribution by institution, and top-cited articles on acupuncture. RESULTS: This analysis, based on Web of Science articles, identified several research trends in studies published over the past 10 years of three therapies for children with cerebral palsy. More articles on botulinum toxin for treating children with cerebral palsy were published than the articles regarding constraint-induced movement therapy or acupuncture. The numbers of publications increased over the 10-year study period. Most papers appeared in journals with a focus on neurology, such as Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology and Journal of Child Neurology. Research institutes publishing on botulinum toxin treatments for this population are mostly in the Netherlands, the United States of America, and Australia; those publishing on constraint-induced movement therapy are mostly in Australia and the United States of America; and those publishing on acupuncture are mostly in China, Sweden and the United States of America. CONCLUSION: Analysis of literature and research trends indicated that there was no one specific therapy to cure cerebral palsy. Further studies are still necessary.

The grafting efficiency and the amount of grafted polymer were evaluated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The colloidal stability testing suggested that the surface-grafted HAP retained higher dispersibility in methylene chloride than pure HAP nanoparticles did. Moreover, the dispersity of the modified particles was significantly improved with the increasing amount of PCL grafted. The composite scaffolds of PCL and surface-grafted HAP exhibited enhanced compressive strength and modulus, which was attributed to the increased interfacial interaction between PCL and surface-modified HAP. In particular, it was found that the compressive modulus of the surface-grafted HAP with 47.2 wt% PCL was 91.6% higher than that of pure HAP mixed with PCL scaffold.

The variations of size and specific surface area with respect to pH for composite polyferric chloride-polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PFC-PDMDAAC) were investigated, and the coagulation efficiency of PFC-PDMDAAC was studied by Jar-test, and Photometric Dispersion Analyzer 2000 (PDA 2000) was used to investigate floc aggregation process of PFC-PDMDAAC. The results show that the average size and specific surface area of PFC-PDMDAAC are larger than that of PFC. The coagulation efficiency of PFC-PDMDAAC is higher than that of PFC and PDMDAAC. The floc aggregation process shows that kaolin particles may be aggregated to micro-flocs by Fe(III) species in PFC-PDMDAAC at first, and then the micro-flocs are bridged together to form large flocs by organic coagulants in PFC-PDMDAAC. The soluble dye is aggregated initially to insoluble dye micro-compound by the reaction of PDMDAAC, and then the insoluble dye micro-compound is aggregated to large flocs by Fe(III) polymers in PFC-PDMDAAC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Then, the water treated by coagulation was filtrated using ultrafiltration membrane. The effect of coagulant dosage and pH on the water treatment efficiency was investigated. Disinfection was carried out for the water treated by coagulation or by combined coagulation-ultrafiltration processes using NaClO solution as disinfectant. The residual chlorine data was fitted using first-order chlorine decay model and the initial concentrations of fast reacting agents and slow reacting agents were obtained by calculating the residual chlorine data using the software AQUASIM. For the purpose of lowest concentration of precursors of disinfection by-products, there existed different coagulant dosages and pH for coagulation and coagulation-ultrafiltration processes. For the water treated by coagulation, the concentration of precursors of disinfection by-products was the lowest when the flocs size was small and the flocs size behaved a concentrated distribution. While for the water treated by coagulation-ultrafiltration, the concentration of precursors of disinfection by-products was the lowest when the flocs size distribution curve had two peaks and the volume percentage of flocs with larger particle size was higher.

77956426155	Coagulation behavior of polyferric chloride for removing NOM from surface water with low concentration of organic matter and its effect on chlorine decay model	Polyferric chloride (PFC) was used to remove natural organic matter (NOM) from the surface water with low concentration of organic matter to evaluate coagulation behavior and floc parameters. The relationship between PFC dosages and chlorine decay was also investigated and the chlorine demand for reacting with organic compounds was estimated by a chlorine model. Under the raw water conditions, the NOM removal efficiency increased within the dosage investigated. The lower specific UV absorbance (SUVA) values were achieved in the dosage range 10-16 mg/L of PFC. Adsorption, entrapment, and complexation played important roles for PFC in removing NOM besides charge neutralization in the coagulation process. Large flocs formed with a PFC dosage of 22 mg/L were better resistant to increasing shear but showed poor recoverability. Small flocs at a PFC dosage of 3 mg/L were little influenced by the increasing shear and showed full reversibility. Coagulation treatment with 22 mg/L of PFC resulted in higher chlorine decay rate, more free chlorine residuals and less total chlorine demand in the effluent when compared to coagulation with dosages of 14 and 3 mg/L. Furthermore, minimal amount of disinfection by-products (DBPs) would be possibly produced after treatment with 22 mg/L of PFC. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The subsequent effect on chlorine decay was studied by a first decay model and AQUASIM modeling software. The results showed that natural organic matter (NOM) removal increased with the increasing dosage of PAC, while the turbidity removal decreased as the zeta potential further increased to the positive side. At low PAC dosages, charge neutralization was the main mechanism for NOM removal. For the dosage of PAC increased, entrapment, adsorption and complexation played important roles in removing NOM. The growth rate of the flocs was raised with the PAC dosage. Flocs formed at a PAC dosage of 3 mg/L were larger than those at high dosages (12 mg/L and 20 mg/L) and became more compact during the slow stir process. D

79960132712	RETRACTED ARTICLE: The hydrolysis properties of dual polymer coagulant - polyferric chloride (PFC) and polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDMDAAC)	In order to study the correlation between inorganic polymer and organic polymer in dual polymer coagulant, the hydrolysate properties of a new dual polymer coagulant, which was composed of polyferric chloride (PFC) and polydimethyldiallylammonium chloride (PDMDAAC), were investigated by examining Fe(III) speciation and zeta potential. Experiments were conducted to analyze the impact of weight concentration of PDMDAAC (Wp), basicity (B) of PFC and intrinsic viscosity (η) of PDMDAAC on the properties of the hydrolysis product of PFC-PDMDAAC. The Fe-Ferron method was used to examine Fe(III) speciation. The results show that the content of Fe(III) momoneric species of PFC-PDMDAAC is lower than that of PFC, and the content of Fe(III) polymer and colloids species of PFC-PDMDAAC is higher than that of PFC. Malvern Zetasizer 3000 was used to measure Zeta potential. PFC-PDMDAAC has a significantly higher positive charge compared to PFC. The zeta potential of PFC-PDMDAAC is higher than 20mV when pH is from 4.0 to 8.0. © 2011 IEEE.

Ultrafiltration was used after coagulation to further remove organics under three pH conditions. The subsequent effects on chlorine decay were studied using a first decay model and AQUASIM modeling software. The results indicated that PFC had different coagulation mechanisms in different pH regions. Charge neutralization was the dominant mechanism in acidic region, while sweep was the predominant mechanism at pH >6.0.

Amine-crosslinked cotton stalk (AC-CS) and wheat stalk (AC-WS) were used for the adsorption of phosphate, and their physicochemical properties as well as biosorption properties for phosphate were discussed intensively. Results indicated that the contents of holocellulose in CS and WS corresponded to the distinct phosphate adsorption capacities between AC-CS and AC-WS.

The chemical species distribution, structure and surface charge of the composite coagulant (PAC-PDMDAAC) were studied by Al-Ferron complexation timed spectrophotometry, TEM and zeta potential measurement, respectively. And the coagulation efficiency of PAC-PDMDAAC was studied by comparing with that of PAC. The results show that there are some interaction between PAC and PDMDAAC.

Two types of HA water containing different quantities of calcium were employed, which were high hardness HA raw water and HA raw water. A series of jar tests were initially conducted to investigate the impacts of calcium on the floc breakage and re-aggregation potential. Flux declines in the UF experiments were used to indicate the membrane foulings in the process. The results indicated that calcium could enhance the sizes and strength of flocs formed by PACl. The beneficial effect of calcium on HA-PACl flocs was more obvious for PACl with smaller B value. The results of UF tests showed that the membrane fouling was significantly dependent on the floc size and smaller flocs resulted in more severe flux decline regardless the presence of calcium. The fluxes of both PACl were advanced in the presence of calcium. The benefit of calcium on membrane fouling for PACl with smaller B value was evident. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84860585518	Sorption of humic acid to organo layered double hydroxides in aqueous solution	Compared with inorganic LDHs, the surfaces of organo layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are less hydrophilic and more organophilic, thus their ability to remove organic contaminants from water can be significantly enhanced. Organo-LDHs with different Mg/Al molar ratios (2:1, 3:1 and 4:1) containing dodecylsulfonate (DSO) as the interlamellar anions were prepared through coprecipitation. Their ability to remove humic acid (HA) from an aqueous medium was studied as a function of pH, sorbent dosage, initial HA concentration, contact time and ionic strength. Under the experimental conditions, the maximum HA removal capacities for 2:1, 3:1 and 4:1 type LDH-DSO were 594.3, 646.7, 428.4. mg/g, respectively, while a carbonate-based LDH only removed 23.77. mg/g. Isotherm studies showed that the sorption of HA to organo-LDH fits well with a " dual-mode model" equation as well as the Freundlich isotherm equation. The sorption was a combination of both partition and specific adsorption. For 3:1 LDH-DSO, the HA sorption process is well described by a pseudo-second order model. LDH-DSO shows a buffering capacity in the pH range from 5.0 to 9.0. The organo-LDHs could be powerful sorbents for removing both high and low concentrations of HA from wastewater. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The study aims at investigating the flocculation performance of EPI-DMA for the model dye, and corresponding floc aggregation properties, which were determined by jar test and photometric dispersion analysis, respectively. The interactions between cationic flocculant and anionic dye were investigated through spectra analysis. The results showed that EPI-DMA effectively decolorized the tested acid and direct dye. The viscosity and cationicity of EPI-DMA had different influence on the removal of different dye. Chemical interaction was observed between quaternary ammonium of EPI-DMA and sulfonic group of dye. The flocculation dynamic process showed that flocs with better aggregation and sedimentation properties were produced by EPI-DMA with higher viscosity and cationicity for acid dye. Contrarily, flocs with the best aggregation and sedimentation properties were produced by EPI-DMA with the lowest viscosity and cationicity for direct dye. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Floc properties including floc growth rate, size, strength, recoverability and fractal dimension under different pH conditions were investigated by Mastersizer 2000. Results indicated that, the flocs formed by AS-CBF (AS dosed first) showed the largest size and the best recoverability across the pH range investigated. While flocs formed by CBF-AS gave the most compact structure. The three coagulants exhibited similar floc growth rate and strength. Moreover, flocs formed in acidic conditions were stronger and more recoverable but showed lower growth rate, smaller size and looser structure compared to those formed at pH > 6 regardless of the coagulant used. Charge neutralization was the dominant mechanism for AS at low pH, while the coagulation mechanism transformed to enmeshment as the pH increased.

The organic poly-diallyl dimethyl ammonium-chloride (PDMDAAC) was added into poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) to produce the dual-composite coagulant (PAC-PDMDAAC). The particulate and organic matter removal during coagulation process was also measured as supporting data. It was intended to examine the influence of hydroxyl to Al molar ratio and PDMDAAC to Al mass ratio on the coagulation performance as well as the content and speciation distribution of residual Al in treated water. Experimental results demonstrated that the coagulation effect and Al fractions were quite different for single PAC and composite PAC-PDMDAAC coagulation system. The additional PDMDAAC can improve impurity removal and decrease the residual total Al concentration of the effluent. Yet, the deterioration of DOC removal at higher dosages and the increment of organically bound Al fraction in treated water can also be noticed by PDMDAAC introduction. The prehydrolyzed degree (basicity) and Al to PDMDAAC mass ratio in composite PAC-PDMDAAC should be determined by virtue of water quality and a preferential aim for coagulation. Majority of the total Al in treated water was particulate Al. In the dissolved Al fraction, organically bound Al forms were present at a higher proportion. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

To study the stabilization mechanisms of Na-Mt particles in the emulsion system, the oil/water interfacial properties were investigated by measuring the zeta potential, interfacial tension and dilational viscoelasticity. The features of Na-Mt particles adsorbed on oil droplets were observed under optical microscopy. The results indicated that, with the increase of Na-Mt particles up to 200. mg/L, the zeta potential became more negative, the interfacial tension decreased greatly, dilational viscoelasticity was enhanced and a stable oil-mineral aggregate (OMA) structure appeared, therefore, the polymer flooding produced water was stabilized. With further increases of Na-Mt particle concentrations, the zeta potential of oil droplets remained stable, the interfacial tension slightly increased, and the dilational viscoelasticity decreased. In this system, a larger OMA structure was apt to form, which could favor the treatment of polymer flooding produced water. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The floc characteristics of PFC-EPI-DMA were extensively examined regarding the decolorizing treatment of synthetic active dying wastewater. The effect of B, η and m(E) on the growth rate, size and time-weighted variance (TWV) of formed flocs were also evaluated through photometric dispersion analyzer. Experimental results indicate that higher m(E) was favorable to floc growth rate, floc size and TWV increase when treating active brilliant red. With respect to decolorizing of active blue, the m(E) influence on floc property was related to coagulant dosage. At lower dosage, the floc growth rate, floc size and TWV was reduced. Meanwhile, lower m(E) was beneficial to the more faster aggregation and growth of formed flocs. However, this trend becomes reversed under comparatively higher dosage conditions. In general, composite PFC-EPI-DMA with comparatively higher η and lower B value could obtain larger and more uniform flocs with faster growth rate.

The influence of OH/Fe molar ratio (B value), Fe to DAM-ECH mass ratio (Mr value) and cross-linker type (ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, and triethylenetetramine denoted as EDM, DTM and TTM, respectively) on color removal efficiency and zeta potential was extensively investigated as functions of flocculants dosage and dye wastewater pH. The decolorization performance and charge neutralization ability of composite PFC-DAM-ECH flocculant were studied in comparison with those achieved by single use of PFC and DAM-ECH. Experimental results indicated that synergic effect of PFC and DAM-ECH improved the color removal efficiency and charge neutralization ability of composite PFC-DAM-ECH. At the conditions of lower B value, higher Mr value and TTM as cross-linker, PFC-DAM-ECH provided higher decolorization effect and stronger charge neutralization effect. In addition, decolorization effect with the composite material is quite effective within the pH range of 6-7.5 for simulated dye wastewater treatment. Furthermore, PFC-DAM-ECH is proved to be more suitable and effective for simulated reactive brilliant red dye wastewater treatment than conventional metal coagulants and organic polymers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The coagulation performance expressed as turbidity and organic matter removal was established as supporting data. Some extra data were evaluated in terms of the residual Al ratio of the composite PASiC coagulant. The main residual Al sources were the Al fractions derived from the use of PASiC. The turbidity and organic matter removal ability was optimal at initial pH 6.00-7.00, while the concentrations of various residual Al species and the residual Al ratio of PASiC were minimal at an initial pH range of 7.00-8.00. Under the conditions of OH/Al molar ratio = 2.00 and Si/Al molar ratio = 0.05, PASiC had superior coagulation performance and comparatively low residual Al concentrations. The Al fraction in the composite PASiC coagulant seldom remained under such conditions. Experimental data also indicated that the suspended (filterable) Al fraction was the dominant species, and organic-bound or organo-Al complex Al was considered to be the major species of dissolved Al in water treated by PASiC coagulation. Additionally, the dissolved inorganic monomeric Al species dominated the dissolved monomeric Al fraction. © 2012 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Various residual Al fractions (total Al, dissolved Al, dissolved monomeric Al, dissolved organically-bound Al and dissolved organic monomeric Al, suspended/particulate Al) were separated and measured in purified water samples. The fundamental floc operational parameters were characterized via floc size, growth rate, and strength factor in this study. Turbidity and organic matter removal were also determined as supporting data. Experimental results demonstrated that the mass ratio of Al to PDMDAAC (MR) and solution pH manifested a significant influence on residual Al speciation distribution. Residual Al content and floc operational parameters exhibited a linear correlation. In addition, moderate floc size, strength factor, growth rate and removal efficiency were favorable to the reduction of residual Al concentration for one coagulant under various pH conditions. For different coagulation system under the same pH condition, the higher the values of floc operational parameters and removal performance, the lower the residual Al content. The Al speciation was altered before and after coagulation. A majority of total Al in treated water was in the dissolved form. In dissolved Al form, the monomeric Al and organically bound Al were presented at a higher proportion under conditions of 4 < pH < 6 and pH > 7, respectively. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the growth, breakage and regrowth of flocs were investigated by use of a laser diffraction particle sizing device. The experimental results showed that Ee had significant coagulant aid effect while the aid role of SA was not obvious, but when used together with FC, flocs showed larger particle sizes and growth rates no matter which coagulant aid was selected. Meanwhile the strength and recovery ability of flocs showed a corresponding increase. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The melting points of SA-MA mixtures with varying combination proportions were tested to determine eutectic ratio. Adopting heating-ultrasonic method, the SA-MA mixtures with eutectic ratio were blended under different conditions to obtain a series of eutectic mixtures, and then their thermal properties and chemical structures were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), respectively. The results showed that the eutectic mass ratio of SA to MA was 36-64%; within certain time range, more heating time can result in lower melting point, but not the longer, the better; when the heating temperature increased, the melting point of eutectic mixture had a little irregular change, but the melting time of solid mixture obviously reduced, so, heating temperature should be considered synthetically to save energy; ultrasonic vibrating process hardly had influences on the properties of eutectic mixtures, and can be canceled; the preparation of fatty acids eutectic mixture did not have any damages to the chemical structures of fatty acids. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84876333518	Application and advantages of novel clay ceramic particles (CCPs) in an up-flow anaerobic bio-filter (UAF) for wastewater treatment	Utilization of clay ceramic particles (CCPs) as the novel filter media employed in an up-flow anaerobic bio-filter (UAF) was investigated. After a series of tests and operations, CCPs have presented higher total porosity and roughness, meanwhile lower bulk and grain density. When CCPs were utilized as fillers, the reactor had a shorter start up period of 45days comparing with conventional reactors, and removal rate of chemical oxygen demand (COD) still reached about 76% at a relatively lower temperature during the stable state. In addition, degradation of COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH

84876341930	Effects of dissolved organic matter size fractions on trihalomethanes formation in MBR effluents during chlorine disinfection	In this study, effects of dissolved organic matter (DOM) size fractions on trihalomethanes (THMs) formation in MBR effluents during chlorination were investigated by fractionating DOM into >100, 30-100, 10-30, 5-10 and <5kDa fractions using ultrafiltration (UF) membranes based on molecular weight (MW). Fractions of MW>30kDa constituted 87% of DOM and were the main THMs precursors, which exhibited higher specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) and THMs formation potential (THMFP) and should be reduced to control THMs formation. For these fractions, THMs formation was mostly attributed to slow chlorine decay, and THMs yield coefficients were low because halogenated intermediates derived from the macromolecular DOM were difficult to decompose to produce THMs. Moreover, there was a strong linear correlation between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and THMFP (R

Optimum dosages of PFC and PFC-PDMDAAC were ascertained in traditional and enhanced coagulation region by jar tests. Subsequently, the influences of the characteristics of flocs pre-formed in traditional and enhanced coagulation process on ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling were studied. The results of the study indicated that traditional coagulation, the first enhanced coagulation and the second enhanced coagulation occurred at the dosage of 15. mg/L, 44. mg/L and 72. mg/L respectively in the PFC dosage range investigated in the experiments. And the coagulation mechanism was precipitation charge neutralization, charge neutralization, and sweep flocculation, respectively. For PFC-PDMDAAC, 10. mg/L, 21. mg/L and 41. mg/L was the optimum dosage in traditional coagulation (charge neutralization), the first enhanced coagulation (bridging and charge neutralization) and the second enhanced coagulation (sweep flocculation) respectively. Flocs formed in traditional coagulation region were the biggest. The floc structure was the most compact in the first enhanced coagulation region. Flocs of the second enhanced coagulation region were highly positively charged and flocs of traditional coagulation region were positively charged for PFC and uncharged for PFC-PDMDAAC. For both PFC and PFC-PDMDAAC, the hierarchy of membrane fouling under traditional and enhanced coagulation was traditional coagulation > the first enhanced coagulation > the second enhanced coagulation. Enhanced coagulation could reduce the UF membrane fouling effectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84878928727	The dye or humic acid water treatment and membrane fouling by polyaluminum chloride composited with sodium alginate in coagulation -ultrafiltration process	Composite flocculants have been extensively studied and applied in recent years in order to improve the water treatment efficiency. In this study, a new composite flocculant prepared by polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and sodium alginate (SA) was used to treat dye and humic acid water in the coagulation- ultrafiltration process. The subsequent effects of PAC/SA on ultrafiltration membrane fouling were investigated by calculating the Modified Fouling Index (MFI). The results showed that the application of PAC/SA could not only restrict the membrane fouling but also improve the removal efficiency of the coagulation-ultrafiltration process. MFI of PAC/SA was the lowest, followed by PAC and the raw water for coagulated effluents filtered by ultrafiltration membrane. For example, MFI of PAC/SA was 0.40 s mL

The results indicated that ULSC with the high expansion and low water absorption were obtained when the OM/IM ratios were between 0.16 and 0.24. The OM/IM ratios had great effect on magnitude of physical forces of EF and ST; the relationship between EF and ST could determine pores formation and expansion of ULSC. Na-Ca feldspars of ceramsite grew as OM/IM ratios increased and the sintering process made some components of raw materials transform into other crystals having better thermostability. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84883004215	Determination of active ingredients of a new coagulant aid-Enteromorpha by floc characteristics on-line monitoring in Yellow River water treatment	As a kind of by-product of marine green tides, Enteromorpha can be used as a new coagulant aid in water treatment process for the purpose of "treating waste by waste". The possible active ingredients (Ai) of this coagulant aid, including polysaccharide (Po), protein (Pr), crud fiber (Cf) and the combination of them (Po-Pr, Po-Cf and Cf-Pr), were extracted and then used as coagulant aid in Yellow River water treatment respectively. The dual-coagulant, aluminum sulfate (AS)-coagulant aid, was achieved by dosing coagulant aid 30. s after AS was dosed. The growth, breakage and regrowth of flocs formed by dual-coagulants were comparatively investigated to determine the Ai of Enteromorpha. The results showed that flocs sizes and growth rates increased by 150-200% due to Po and Cf addition, and meanwhile the strength and recovery ability could be enhanced by 40-50%. Moreover, floc produced by AS-Po and AS-Cf possess larger fractal dimension which means denser floc structure. However, floc characteristics could not be enhanced when Pr was used as coagulant aid. Further discussion indicated that the Ai of Enteromorpha as coagulant aid was Po and Cf, and there was no interaction effect among Cf, Po and Pr. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84883390649	Flocculation kinetics and floc characteristics of dye wastewater by polyferric chloride-poly-epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine composite flocculant	The polyferric chloride-poly-epichlorohydrin-dimethylamine (PFC-ECH-DAM) composite flocculants with different OH/Fe ratios, Fe to organic ECH-DAM mass ratios and cross-linker types were comparatively investigated in terms of formed floc aggregation process and floc characteristics for the treatment of synthetic dyeing wastewater. The effect of OH/Fe molar ratio (B value), Fe to ECH-DAM mass ratio (MR value), cross-linker type and ECH-DAM addition on floc characteristics was investigated as function of flocculant dosage and dye wastewater pH. The results demonstrate that the synergic effect of PFC with ECH-DAM promoted the formation of larger flocs with higher growth rate and wider distribution of floc sizes. During the coagulation of reactive red (K-2BP) dyeing wastewater, strengthened floc properties can be obtained at higher flocculant dosage ranges (>80 mg/L) and solution pH of about 7.5. The floc TWV values appear to show that the predominant flocculation mechanism of PFC-ECH-DAM are bridging adsorption and sweep flocculation. In addition, relatively lower OH/Fe molar ratio, higher Fe to ECH-DAM mass ratio and utilizing polyethylene polyamine as cross-linker were favorable for the formation of flocs with larger size, higher growth rate and larger size variation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84885063475	Floc characterization and membrane fouling of polyferric-polymer dual/composite coagulants in coagulation/ultrafiltration hybrid process	Papermaking sludge and spent pickling liquor were recycled to synthesize a macromolecular lignin-acrylamide polymer (LA) and polyferric chloride (PFC), respectively. The dual-coagulant PFC-LA (PFC and LA were dosed orderly), composite coagulant PFCLA (PFC and LA premixed before dosed) and PFC were used in coagulation/ultrafiltration hybrid process in surface water treatment. The objectives of this paper are to comparatively investigate final water quality after coagulation and coagulation/ultrafiltration process and floc properties, including floc size, strength, recoverability and floc structure, with or without LA addition. Additionally, the relationship between membrane fouling and floc characteristics was discussed. The results showed that best final water quality was obtained by PFC-LA, sequentially followed by PFCLA and PFC. Floc size, growth rate, strength and recoverability as well as fractal dimension were also in the order of PFC-LA > PFCLA > PFC. The maximum permeate fluxes before and after backwash operation were obtained by PFC-LA, which gave the largest and most compact flocs. Coagulation suspension after breakage resulted in much more serious membrane fouling for PFC, whereas permeate flux slightly decreased when LA was used in combination with PFC. © 2013.

SSC with higher expansion rate and lower water absorption could be obtained as the heating rate was between 4 °C/min and 5 °C/min. Porosity and expansibility of SSC were closely related to the heating rate. The heating rate could affect the relationship between the forming rate of gas and the forming rate of glass phase, and further influenced the bloating phenomenon of SSC. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The four common fatty acids: stearic acid (SA), palmitic acid (PA), myristic acid (MA) and lauric acid (LA) were selected as representative to prepare binary and ternary eutectic mixtures by heating-ultrasonic method. The melting points of LA-MA, LA-SA, SA-MA, SA-PA, MA-PA, LA-MA-SA, MA-SA-PA mixtures with varying combination proportions were determined and then analyzed by drawing the phase diagrams to determine the eutectic points and the corresponding mixing proportions. The results showed that the eutectic temperature of ternary fatty acids was lower than binary fatty acids'; ternary mixture possessed the same thermal properties with pseudo-binary mixture in both melting temperature and latent heat of phase change; the Schröeder-Van Laar equation can be taken as a basis for mixing proportion of pseudo-binary fatty acid and ternary fatty acid systems; the ternary eutectic point on the ternary phase diagram was just in the vicinity of a small triangle which was formed by the connection between the three vertices and the three eutectic points of binary fatty acid in the corresponding across flats. Moreover, ternary and pseudo-binary mixtures had advantage in energy conservation applications such as building heating/cooling and indoor temperature controlling especially when the temperature in need was low. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Physicochemical properties of LA were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental outcome indicated acrylamide was grafted onto the lignin backbone successfully. The effects of LA addition were evaluated on coagulation performance and floc characteristics as a function of aluminum (Al) dosage, such as floc size, growth rate, strength and recoverability. Effects of different dosing sequences, Al dosed first and LA dosed first, were also investigated. LA used as coagulant aid markedly enhanced the removal efficiency of turbidity and dissolved organic carbon, especially at low Al dosages. The dissolved organic carbon removal efficiencies of aluminum sulfate and polyaluminum chloride at the Al dosage range selected in this study were improved more than 30% and 5% by LA, respectively. LA dramatically enlarged floc size and it was in the order: Al dosed first > LA dosed first > Al. Floc strength and recoverability were also improved by LA.

The three biosorbents were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Boehm's titration and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The XRD data of the samples indicated that the crystallinity of HWS became ordered after adsorbing Pb(II). Based on the XPS, FTIR and Boehm's titration results, HWS had more acidic functional groups and less amino functional groups than HWUS and HWSU. Batch adsorption experiments were performed to evaluate the adsorption properties of the biosorbents toward Pb(II), which indicated that the adsorption capacity of HWS increased after modified by urea. The adsorption was demonstrated to be strongly influenced by the pH, and the optimum pH was 5.5. Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, and the equilibrium data were well described by Langmuir isotherm than the other equations. The Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm indicated a process of chemical adsorption. Cation exchange, surface complexation and electrostatic attraction could be the main adsorption mechanisms for Pb(II) adsorption onto the biosorbents.

84894652344	Adsorption and cosorption of ciprofloxacin and Ni(II) on activated carbon-mechanism study	Antibiotics and heavy metals often coexist in water bodies due to influxes of various pollution sources. The objective of this study was to evaluate the interaction between Ni(II) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) concerning their adsorption and cosorption onto activated carbon as a function of time, solution pH and initial concentration. Adsorption of Ni(II) and CIP on activated carbon was strongly dependent on solution pH, indicating an electrostatic attraction mechanism. Cosorption of Ni(II) and CIP also strongly depended on solution pH. The presence of CIP suppressed Ni(II) adsorption, especially at low pH, due to the competition of CIP with Ni(II) for adsorption sites. The presence of Ni(II) in the aqueous solution increased the adsorption of CIP onto activated carbon at pH between 3.4 and 6.5, because the positively charged complexes of Ni-CIP with greater sorption affinity to activated carbon than CIP itself form in this pH range. © 2013 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.

A total of 573 patients with upper GIT cancer between January 2004 and December 2007 were enrolled in this study. Serum levels of CEA, CA19-9, CA24-2, AFP, CA72-4, SCC, TPA and TPS were examined preoperatively and every 3 months postoperatively by ELISA. The sensitivity of CEA, CA19-9, CA24-2, AFP, CA72-4, SCC, TPA and TPS were 26.8%, 36.2%, 42.9%, 2.84%, 25.4%, 34.6%, 34.2% and 30.9%, respectively. The combined detection of CEA+CA199+CA242+CA724 had higher sensitivity and specificity in gastric cancer (GC) and cardiac cancer, while CEA+CA199+CA242+SCC was the best combination of diagnosis for esophageal cancer (EC). Elevation of preoperative CEA, CA19-9 and CA24-2, SCC and CA72-4 was significantly associated with pathological types (p < 0.05) and TNM staging (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that CA24-2 was significantly correlated with CA19-9 (r = 0.810, p < 0.001). The levels of CEA, CA19-9, CA24-2, CA72-4 and SCC decreased obviously 3 months after operations. When metastasis and recurrence occurred, the levels of TMs significantly increased. On multivariate analysis, high preoperative CA72-4, CA24-2 and SCC served as prognostic factors for cardiac carcinoma, GC and EC, respectively. combined detection of CEA+CA199+CA242+SCC proved to be the most economic and practical strategy in diagnosis of EC; CEA+CA199+CA242+CA724 proved to be a better evaluation indicator for cardiac cancer and GC. CEA and CA19-9, CA24-2, CA72-4 and SCC, examined postoperatively during follow-up, were useful to find early tumor recurrence and metastasis, and evaluate prognosis. AFP, TPA and TPS have no significant value in diagnosis of patients with upper GIT cancer.

To probe the influences of DOM characteristics on trihalomethanes (THMs) formation reactivity during chlorination, THMs yield and speciation of DOM fractions was investigated. It was found that chlorine reactivity of DOM decreased with the decrease of molecular weight (MW), and MW > 30. kDa fractions produced over 55% of total THMs in chlorinated MBR effluent. Hydrophobic organics had much higher THMs formation reactivity than hydrophilic substances. Particularly, hydrophobic acids exhibited the highest chlorine reactivity and contributed up to 71% of total THMs formation. Meanwhile, low-MW and hydrophilic DOM were susceptible to produce bromine-containing THMs. Of the fluorescent DOM in MBR effluent, aromatic moieties and humic acid-like had higher chlorine reactivity. Conclusively, macromolecular and hydrophobic organics containing aromatic moieties and humic acid-like must be removed to reduce THMs formation.

We demonstrated that overexpression of miR-224-5p in ovarian cancer patients is associated with platinum-based chemoresistance using miRNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation in vivo, as well as in 4 human ovarian cancer cell lines (C13/OV2008; A2780CP/A2780S) in vitro. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of miR-224-5p in regulating the chemoresistance of ovarian cancer. By using the sensitive miRNA transient transfection, we demonstrated expression and bioactivity of miR-224-5p in ovarian cancer cell lines. It is of note that enforced expression of miR-224-5p enhanced chemoresistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells through apoptosis reversion. We predicted and identified the PRKCD gene as one of the targets of miR-224-5p in mediating the primary chemoresistance of ovarian cancer patients. We showed reciprocal expression of miR-224-5p and PRKCD by quantitative analysis in complete response and incomplete response patients in vivo, and 2 pairs of cisplatin resistance and sensitive cell lines in vitro, after either miR-224-5p overexpression or knock-down transfection. Additionally, miR-224-5p and PRKCD can serve as novel predictors and prognostic biomarkers for ovarian papillary serous carcinoma (OPSC) patient response to overall disease-specific survival. Our findings suggest that miR-224-5p may function as an oncogene and induce platinum resistance in OPSC at least in part by downregulating PRKCD, thereby providing a biomarker for predicting chemosensitivity to cisplatin in patients with ovarian cancer.

Fifty cases of breast cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy were collected. All these cases were revised and classified into chemotherapy sensitive (CS) or chemotherapy resistant (CR) group according to the Miller and Payne (MP) grading system. Immunohistochemically, hRad9 positive tumours showed nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining. hRad9 over-expression was associated with an impaired neoadjuvant chemotherapy response. A significant correlation was found between expression of hRad9 and Cyclin D1. In vitro, hRad9 was knocked down using siRNA in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. Deregulated expression of Rad9 accompanied by down expression of chk1 enhanced the sensitivity of human breast cancer cells to doxorubicin. Our work suggests that hRad9 might be a potential predictor for the response to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer and its clinical value as a target for improving chemosensitivity needs further exploration.

84924246397	Isolation of stem-like cells from human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells using limiting dilution in combination with vincristine selection	To isolate stem-like cells from the human MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line, different subpopulations of MG-63 cells were cloned by limiting dilution and passaged to obtain different sublines. The subline with highest clonogenicity was identified using a proliferation assay, cell-cycle analysis, and soft-agar colony-forming assay. The sublines were further selected in serumfree medium containing 20 ng/ml vincristine to identify cells that could form suspended sarcospheres. Identified cells were then characterized based on morphology, cell surface markers, adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, and tumorigenicity in nude mice. A total of 19 holoclones that could be stably passaged were obtained. Sublines A1, A3, and D1 were markedly different from other sublines and the parental cell line. Subline D1 not only had a higher colony-forming efficiency and formed larger colonies, but also possessed a shorter latency of tumorigenesis in vivo. After subline D1 was cultured in suspension in medium containing vincristine, a highly enriched subpopulation of cells that could form sarcospheres and be stably passaged were obtained. These cells, designated as MG-63-M expressed multiple markers of multipotent or embryonic stem cells and possessed the capacity for self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and significant multi-drug resistance. Thus, our results suggest that a subpopulation of stem-like cells can be isolated from human MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line.

84925635809	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of substituted guanidine indole derivatives as potential inhibitors of HIV-1 Tat-TAR interaction	The interaction between the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat and RNA response element (TAR) plays a critical role in HIV-1 transcription. Based on the pharmacophore model of reported inhibitors, a series of novel substituted guanidine indole derivatives was designed, synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro HIV-1 and HIV-2 inhibitory activity using the IIIB strain and ROD strain, respectively. Preliminary biological evaluation indicated that three compounds exhibited marked inhibitory activity against HIV-1 III<inf>B</inf>. Quite unexpectedly, compound a-7 was also endowed with the moderate anti-HIV-2 potency (EC<inf>50</inf> = 58.14 μM). In addition, preliminary discussion on the activity results and molecular modeling of these new analogues were presented in this manuscript.
