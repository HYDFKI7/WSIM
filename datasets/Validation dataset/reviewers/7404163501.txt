17944383152	Distribution of taxol and taxanes in yew tree	The contents of taxol and its two important precursors, namely baccatin III(B III) and 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) in various tissues of yew trees [Taxus chinensis(Pilg.) Rehd.] at different ages in different seasons were quantified by HPLC. The results indicated that the content of taxol decreased successively according to stem barks, root barks, lateral stem barks, seeds, fibres, twigs and young needles in a single tree. The gradient distribution of taxol concentration along radial direction of cross section of lateral stem was surveyed for the first time. It was found that the highest amount of taxol occurred in the secondary xylem rather than in the cortex of the lateral stem. The highest and the lowest contents of 10-DAB and B III among the parts of a tree occurred in needles and fibres, respectively. The content of 10-DAB in needles was in a range of 0.01% to 0.02%, higher than that of B III and taxol. The result of the absence of both taxol and related taxanes in needles from 2-3 years old yew tree indicated that the biosynthesis of taxanes may require related phase of the development of the plant. It was observed that the mature needles in the spring have higher amount of taxol than in autumn, while the case of 10-DAB was in reverse. The mechanisms of biosynthesis and accumulation of taxol were discussed through the analysis of the distribution of taxol and related compounds in T. chinensis(Pilg.)R.

18144415493	Importance of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in taxol biosynthesis in Taxus chinensis cultures	The roles of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in paclitaxel production were investigated in cell suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis. In the normal cultures, the trend of G6PDH activity was similar to that of cell growth. Addition of glutamate increased G6PDH activity, while dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) decreased G6PDH activity. In elicitor-treated cultures, cell growth was depressed, while G6PDH activity and taxol production were enhanced compared with the control. Glutamate recovered the depression of cell growth, and resulted in further increase in G6PDH activity and taxol production. Contrarily, DHEA exacerbated the depression of cell growth, and decreased G6PDH activity and taxol production induced by fungal elicítor. The results indicated that G6PDH played a critic role of taxol production by affecting cell viability.

21844463083	Cumulant-based image fingerprints	A fingerprinting is related to cryptographic hash functions. In contrast to cryptographic hash functions this robust digest is sensitive only to perceptual change. Minor changes, which are not affecting the perception, do not result in a different fingerprint. This technique is used in content-based retrieval, content monitoring, and content filtering. In this paper we present a cumulant-based image fingerprinting method. Cumulants are typically used in signal processing and image processing, e.g. for blind source separation or Independent Component Analysis (ICA). From an image with reduced dimensions we calculate cumulants as an initial feature vector. This feature vector is transformed into an image fingerprint. The theoretical advantages of cumulants are verified in experiments evaluating robustness (e.g. against operations like lossy compression, scaling and cropping) and discriminability. The results show an improved performance our method in comparison to existing methods. © 2005 SPIE and IS&T.

26844470125	LC-ESI-MS metabolic profiling analysis of taxanes from the extracts of Taxus chinensis cell cultures	Aim: To develop a rapid analytical method for small amount biological samples of taxanes by using liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) in small amount biological samples. Methods: A solution containing five given taxane constituents and the extract from cell cultures of Taxus chinensis were analysed separately. According to the performance of the given taxanes in ESI-MS/MS, run parameters of the mass spectrometer were optimized. Positive and negative electrospray modes were employed to simultaneously scan the cell cultures sample, and the full ion chromatogram and the molecular weight of individual peak were obtained. The qualitative analysis of taxanes was achieved by comparison of the retention time and molecular weight with those of the reference substances or was based on the interpretation of the MS/MS spectra of the analytes and the knowledge of the concerning genetic backgrounds of taxanes published in literatures. Results: The taxanes with several acetyl substituents tended to produce ammonium adduct ions peak, while multi-hydroxy taxanes were subject to give protonized molecular ion peaks in positive ion ESI-MS. Thirteen taxanes in cell samples were assigned. Eight compounds of them were identified to be 1-acetyl-5, 7, 10-deacetyl-baccatin I (DAB-I, 1), baccatin III (B-III, 3), baccatin VI (B-VI, 8), taxol (9), yunnanxane (10), taxuyunnanine C (Tc, 11), sinenxane B (12), sinenxane C (13), separately. For the other five constituents, character of taxane and the number of substituents were deduced. Conclusion: The results confirm the feasibility of characterizing taxanes in biological samples by LC-ESI-MS analysis. The analytical methodology provided a rapid, conventional and reliable tool to study metabolic profiling of taxanes for structural elucidation in taxol biosynthesis.

30944444588	Phylogenetic analysis of spore-forming thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria from oil field	Two strains of spore-forming, thermophilic, sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from oil field in order to obtain extreme microorganisms. Strain CW-02 was isolated from ground sewerage of oil field. It is facultatively anaerobic with optimal pH of 2.8 and maximum temperature at 48°C. The optimum NaCl concentration for its growth is 30.0 g/L. CW-03 was isolated from crude oil well of more than 4 000 m deep. It is strictly anaerobic and not aciduric with maximum temperature of 68°C, and it can use the organic compounds with relatively short carbon chains as electron donors. The two strains are non-motile, curved rod, Gram-positive and spore-forming with polar flagella. The analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence indicated that the two strains, CW-02 (accession numbers: AY703031) and CW-03 (accession numbers: AY703031) belonged to the genus Desulfotomaculum (Peptococcaceae, Clostridiales, Clostridia, Firmicutes, Bacteria), and their similarity with D. nigrificans and D. aeronauticumd was 98%. However, by means of multiple sequence alignments CW-03 belongs to Archaea and it is close to Archaeoglobus.

3042630622	Robust image watermarking algorithm against rotation, scaling and translation	Geometric attack is an open problem to digital watermark. Current techniques could not solve it effectively, especially for block-based watermarking. A new method is proposed to provide an easy-use and robust detection to geometric transform parameters. A rectangle frame in an image is utilized to estimate the coefficients of geometric attack and locate watermarking. Median filtering and sharpening on the rectangle frame are used to enable a more accurate estimation. Cropping attack is also detected by the method. The geometric distortion's correction based on the estimation results is performed to make watermark synchronized by the template matching. Experimental results verify that this method provides an accurate estimation and a nearly lossless restoration of watermark.

32844461716	Optimization of arachidonic acid production by fed-batch culture of Mortierella alpina based on dynamic analysis	Arachidonic acid is an essential fatty acid in human nutrition. Improvement of arachidonic acid production by fungus Mortierella alpina was investigated. The time courses of fungal biomass, lipid and arachidonic acid production with different initial glucose concentrations were examined to study dynamic characteristics of arachidonic acid production on a shaker flask scale. Results showed that low initial concentrations of glucose were good for fungal growth at the early days of cultivation. When residual glucose concentration was under 10 g/L, fungi stopped growing because of inefficient energy source and carbon source needed for their growth. Meanwhile, the lipids were still accumulated for a period even though fungi stop growing. A great increase of arachidonic acid content in lipids occurred after the glucose was exhausted. To obtain high arachidonic acid yield, a fed-batch process was developed according to the dynamic analysis. Glucose and nitrate were included in the feed medium. Low initial glucose concentration (50 g/L) and nitrate concentration (3 g/L) were used to shorten the lag phase of fungal growth. Twenty grams per liter per day glucose and 1.5 g/(L day) nitrate were fed to the medium at the 3rd, 4th and 5th days of cultivation. A good arachidonic acid yield (7.74 g/L) on the 8th day was obtained, which was a great improvement over that of batch cultures. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33744512080	New test methods for scanner point spread function evaluation	The process of printing and scanning is one of the most difficult problems not to be solved in the field of digital watermarking, because of lack knowledge of their nature. In the other hand, scanners are one of the most popular consumer tools for storage, processing, and transmission of digital images. There are blurs in scanning output image in most cases, which results from optical parts of scanners. One path to decrease the blurs is to deconvolve the blurred images with determined point spread function of a scanner. This paper focuses on the process of scanning, and two proposed methods in this paper to test the scanner's point spread function. One is based on ISO standard, and the other method is a mathematical approximation to line spread function by Hermite polynomials. Compared with the standard method, the advantage of the latter method is to acquire a complete two-dimensional PSF profile. Experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient for scanning point spread function evaluation.

33746834911	The dynamic variation of several important taxane content in post-harvest Taxus chinensis clippings	The dynamic variations of several important taxanes, taxol, baccatin III (B-III), 1-acety-5,7,10-deacetyl-baccatin I (DAB-I) and baccatin VI (B-VI), were investigated in post-harvest clippings of Taxus chinensis . The clippings were preserved over 20 days at two different temperatures (4°C and room temperature), or by cuttage in the light and in the dark, or promptly dried. The accumulation of taxol in needles of the clippings was found increase in the initial stages of the stored period and then decreased gradually. The maximum accumulation of taxol occurred in the case of cold storing (4°C) at day 3, doubling the data on the day when the biomass was harvested. In contrast, in the cases of cold storage and cuttage the contents of the other three taxanes showed a sharp decrease at the beginning and then an increase from 3 to 6 days, and subsequently a drop until day 20. The similar variation of taxane contents was not found in the needles of immediately dried clippings as well as in the stem samples of clippings. These results indicated that the content variation of taxol and related taxanes of post-harvest clippings was related to the manner of preservation, timing and plant tissue. Moreover, the mechanism of the fluctuation of the taxane contents in post-harvest clippings is discussed, in particular taxol biosynthesis in response to mechanical wounding of harvest. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

33751038984	Transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing arabidopsis transcriptional factor CBF1 show morphological and biochemical characteristics associated with cold tolerance	Transcriptional factor CBFs (C-repeat/dehydration responsive element binding factors) play important roles in plants' adaptation to low temperature and are prospective to be used in the engineering of cold-tolerant crops. Arabidopsis CBF1 was expressed in tobacco plants in the present study to investigate the effects of CBF1 on growth performance and cold tolerance in cold sensitive plants. Tobacco plants over expressing CBF1 had shorter stature, thicker stems, thicker and glossier leaves, higher chlorophyll content, weaker apical dominance and longer time to flowering than control tobacco plants. Over expression of Arabidopsis CBF1 in tobacco plants dose-dependently promoted surviving low temperature by increasing photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), soluble sugar content and proline content and decreasing malondiadehyde (MDA) content under low temperature stress. These results indicated that Over expression of CBF1 could conferred elevated tolerance to low temperature upon cold sensitive plants. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

Chromatography was carried out on a reverse phase C18 column with isocratic-mode elution. By analytically comparing LC/ESI-MS/MS of the extracts with that of the available reference substances and literature, six taxoids were identified as taxuyunnanine C (Tc, 1), yunnanxane (2), 2α,5α10β-triacetoxy-14β-propionyloxytaxa-4(20),11-diene (3), 2α,5α,10β-triacetoxy-14β-(2-methyl)butyryloxytaxa- 4(20),11-diene (4), taxol (5), and baccatin III (B III, 6), respectively. Among them, 2, 3 and 4 were assigned in the absence of the corresponding reference substances, and 3 and 4 were detected in this cell line for the first time. The identification was validated by NMR spectra. The precise quantification of 1 and 5 was made using HPLC. The limit of detection (LOD), 0.5 μg/ml for 5, 1.5 μg/ml for 1, and the linearity and accuracy of the quantitative method were evaluated, indicating a wide linear range and satisfactory accuracy. The amounts of other identified taxoids were calculated on the basis of comparison of the absolute response factors of similar structural substances. The proposed method provides a rapid, conventional and reliable tool to characterize and study cell lines for elucidating the taxane biosynthesis. © 2007 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

34547265171	Leaf epidermal characters of Lonicera japonica and Lonicera confuse and their ecology adaptation	The leaf epidermis of Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) and Wild Honeysuckle (Lonicera confusa) in the genus of Flos Lonicerae were mainly observed by scanning electron microscopes (SEM) to study the characteristics of stomata, trichomes and dermal cell, etc.. The results showed that stoma exists only on the lower epidermis and its distribution is irregular, and leaf epidermis consist of epidermis cells, stoma complexes and bushy trichomes including glandular hair and non-glandular hair. On the upper epidermis, anticlinal wall caves in sinuous groove to countercheck the transpiration. Evidences from leaf morphological structures serve as another proof on drought-resistant mechanisms. Some strumaes distributing regularly are hypothesized as oxalic calcium on the lower epidermis under laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) with Fluo-3/AM, which can increase their endurance to drought stress. Therefore, the above characteristics of Flos Lonicerae can reduce the loss of water and make Japanese honeysuckle and Wild Honeysuckle adapt to the droughty environment at Karst area in southwest China. However, there is some difference of the two species. From the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) result, it is shown that on the upper epidermis, some glandular hair regularly present along the midrib of Japanese honeysuckle, but Wild Honeysuckle has no glandular hair on the upper epidermis, which can verify the relationships of Flos Lonicerae species and provide the significance for classification of Flos Lonicerae. © Northeast Forestry University and Ecological Society of China 2007.

Shape irregularity of solder joint is a kind of faults in printed circuit board. Its detection and location involve geometrical shape determination. How to acquire geometrical shape information of solder joint is crucial for the detection and location of shape irregularity of solder joint. In addition, geometrical shape information of solder joint is a measure to evaluate soldering manner, apparatus and technician. A novel algorithm for solder joint shape inspection using least square fitting is proposed in this paper. The profile image of solder joint shape is curve fitted by using least square fitting. Then the approximate ideal circle parameters including center and radius are estimated. The deviation between solder joint shape and the approximate ideal circle is also obtained. Experiments were carried out. Experiment results validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Phase information is extracted from slantlet domain for image fingerprints. Better performance is verified in experiments evaluating robustness (e.g. against operations like lossy compression, scaling and cropping) and discriminability in comparison to an existing method.

In contrast to cryptographic hash functions this robust digest is sensitive only to perceptual change. Minor changes, which are not affecting the perception, do not result in a different hash. Image robust hashing is used in content-based retrieval, monitoring, and filtering. In this paper an image robust hashing method based on sign bit from the domain of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is presented. DCT is widely used in image processing and video processing, e.g. for compression or digital watermarking. From an image with reduced dimensions we apply 2-D DCT to derive an initial feature vector. The sign bit of this feature vector is extracted to form an intermediate hash. The intermediate hash can be incorporated into some security mechanism to derive a final hash. The advantages of the sign signal in DCT domain are verified in experiments evaluating robustness (e.g. against operations like lossy compression, scaling and cropping) and discriminability.

This paper discusses the effect of Taxus cell cultures on the 18S rRNA gene sequences based on the phylogenetic analysis of cultured T. chinensis cells and related species. The phylogenetic tree is reconstructed using the maximum parsimony method and the relative rate test to test the hypothesis of a molecular clock. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that cell culture changes the phylogenetic position of cultured T. chinensis cells. More than that, the 18S rRNA gene of cultured T. chinensis cells has a faster rate of substitution than that of T. chinensis. With T. media as reference, the divergence time of the cultured T. chinensis cells is 7 Ma (million years) more than that of the T. chinensis cells based on the 18S rRNA gene sequences. © 2008 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung.

The primary chemical components of the essential oil extracted from O. fragrans were linalool and its oxide, α-ionone, β-ionone, nerol, γ-decalactone, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, and hexadecanoic acid, most of which were at their highest concentrations in extracts obtained from flowers at the initial flowering stage. HS-SPME using a PDMS/DVB fibre is a simple, rapid, and solvent-free method for the extraction of volatile compounds emitted from living O. fragrans. HS-SPME with GC-MS can be used to determine the aromatic maturity in O. fragrans, to decide the optimal harvest date. The initial flowering stage was the best time to harvest O. fragrans. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77954801958	Controllable bio-fabrication based on microbes	Microorganisms in nature have rich variety, whose sizes are from nano scale to micro scale. Therefore, microbes can be used as natural "building blocks" in nano/micro multi-level fabrication processes. At present, most of the bio-manufacturing methods do not apply to direct control of living microbes. Their microbiological global functions and superiorities are not available. In this paper, two novel nano/micro bio-fabrication approaches, micro-fluidic control method and magnetic control method have been established. The living microbes could be manipulated to form micro-scaled patterns or to move orientedly. By these approaches, living microbes are taken as nano/micro robots. We could employ their specific biological functions and regulate their controllable self-assembly, which is expected to design and create a series of new special functional materials and devices. © 2009 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

80052656884	Response of phragmites australis morphostructure to the different habitats in the yellow river delta	Plant morphological structures always adapts to the environment. The anatomical characteristics of leaves and roots of Phragmites australis in estuary and inland area of the Yellow River Delta were observed with light microscope and the reed leaf epidermis structure was observed by scanning electron microscope. The results showed that the leaves of Phragmites australis in two regions were identical in general structure, which had many bulliform cells on the upper surface of leaves, and a mass of sunken stoma on the lower surface. For the reed leaves in estuary, the vascular bundle sheath cells spread closely to upper epidermis and some vascular bundle sheath cells break through lower epidermis. In addition, wax ornamentation was present on the surface of the leaves. While the vascular bundle sheath cells of reed leaves in inland were bigger in size and some had two double cells. For the reed roots in estuary, mediopellis cells differentiate into aerenchyma and casparian strip was formed on endoderm. The characteristics of the reed roots and leaves reflected the ecological adaptation to the habitats in which the plants grow.

84876736853	Extraction optimization approach to improve accessibility of functional fraction based on combination of total polyphenol, chromatographic profiling and antioxidant activity evaluation: Pyracantha fortuneana fruit as an example	Optimized solid-liquid extraction conditions by response surface methodology (RSM) and optimal solvent selectivity liquid-liquid fractionation by mixture design were studied for process of Pyracantha fortuneana fruits (PFF) healthy products. A combination of total polyphenolic content (TPC), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and chromatographic profiling was used to evaluate the optimization. RSM results were ethanol concentration, 71%; extraction temperature, 51. °C; and pH solution, 3.2. The mixture design indicated that the fraction with the highest TAA and TPC was directed to ethyl-acetate phase. The fractions of water-soluble and n-butylalcohol-soluble were rich in TAA and TPC compared with the starting row of PFF. Twenty-seven polyphenols were detected in chromatographic profilings, most of which were reported for the first time in this study. The improvements of accessibility in the optimized fractions suggest their flexible applicabilities for nutraceutical food industries.

The unpolished rice saccharificate, wheat bran powder and yeast extract were employed as carbon source, nitrogen source and growth factors, respectively. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the dosages of medium compositions. As a result, when the fermentation was carried out under the optimal conditions for wheat bran powder (29.10 g/l) and yeast extract (2.50 g/l), the d-lactic acid yield reached 731.50 g/kg unpolished rice with a volumetric production rate of 1.50 g/(l h). In comparison with fresh corn and polished rice, the d-lactic acid yield increased by 5.79% and 8.71%, and the raw material cost decreased by 65% and 52%, respectively, when the unpolished rice was used as a major nutrient source.

Limestone is one of the most abundant rock types in karst areas, and is predominantly calcium carbonate. Two types of experimental systems were designed in this paper, to make comparisons of limestone dissolution rate among the acidic materials and extracellular carbonic anhydrase (CA) excreted by fungi and the enwrapping effect of fungal mycelia. One was the simulated experimental system containing microorganisms. Another was the simulated experimental system without microorganisms. Results of previous experiment indicated that the acidic materials and CA like enzymatic materials excreted by fungi and the enwrapping effect of fungal mycelia were important factors influencing limestone dissolution. In the three factors mentioned above, the dissolution effect was mycelia enwraping effect>acidic dissolution effect>CA enzymatic effect. The results of the second experiment demonstrated further that the limestone dissolution effect of the acidic materials excreted by fungi was stronger than that of CA excreted by fungi. Nevertheless, CA still played an important role in promoting the dissolution of limestone. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

High-quality total RNA was isolated and synthesized to cDNA. Transcript levels of four paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway genes: dxr, hmgr, ggpps and dbat were assayed by real-time RT-PCR. The results demonstrated that the transcript levels of these genes experienced a coincident descent in the past three years as well as a decreasing paclitaxel productivity. According to these results, the possible reason for the descending paclitaxel productivity during long-term Taxus media cv. Hicksii cell culture maybe due to a decreasing transcripts level of mass genes in close with a gross secondary metabolite level. Gene manipulation emphasized only on key enzyme genes in the paclitaxel biosynthesis pathway may not hamper the somaclonal variation trend of Taxus media cv.

The simple single sequence molecular markers verified the hybridity of those hybrids. Chimeras were justified and totally classified based on the morphological characteristics of the flower petals that appeared in the hybrids of B. carinata and B. rapa. Two kinds of flower chimeras were observed: one type was different flower petals were with different colour in one branch; another type was that yellow petals were with white variegations, but the variegation size and shape were different in different petals. The meiosis and mitosis analysis showed that the partial or complete separation of parental genomes inferred to occur in pollen mother cells, shoot and early-developed petals in the flower chimeral hybrids, which hinted that the occurrence of complete or partial segregation of parental genomes in the somatic cells might be the reason for the production of flower chimera in the hybrids of B. carinata and B. rapa. © 2009 Academic Journals.

63849162228	Influence of flowering stage of Lonicera japonica Thunb. on variation in volatiles and chlorogenic acid	BACKGROUND: The volatile oil of Lonicera japonica Thunb. is an edible natural perfume that is often used in foods, cigarettes and cosmetics. Chlorogenic acid, a major bioactive component of L. japonica, has received much attention recently owing to its antiviral, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. However, to date, few reports have focused on the variation in volatile oil and chlorogenic acid at different flowering stages of L. japonica. RESULTS: Obvious variations in components of the volatile oilwere observed at six different developmental stages. The primary components of the volatile oil were linalool, linalool oxide, geraniol and α-terpineol, which reached their highest levels at the silver flowering stage. The highest levels of chlorogenic acid were found at the second white and complete white flowering stages. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that the best times to harvest L. japonica flowers for volatile oil and chlorogenic acid extraction are the silver flowering stage and the second white or complete white flowering stage respectively. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

The successful creation in vitro of skin substitutes has been the focus of a concentrated research activity for the last 30 or more years, culminating in some success for its translation into the clinical setting. In this paper, a novel artificial skin of bacterial cellulose has been biosynthesized by Acetobacter xylinum and modified by chitosan. BC is thought as an optimal substrate material of artificial skin. It is thought to be an interesting material for using as a substratum of artificial skin because it could provide moist environment to a wound resulting in a better wound healing. But BC has no antimicrobial activity to reduce the probability of wound infection. To achieve antimicrobial activity of BC, it was modified by chitosan due to its antibiotic activity. The structure and components were characterized by FTIR and ESEM. The results indicated the nano-composites of BC and chitosan are promising and potential for wound dressings. © (2009) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

70349316822	Kinetic model for optimal feeding strategy in astaxanthin production by Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous	Astaxanthin is a useful pigmentation source in fish aquaculture. It has strong antioxidative activity and therefore has potential application in delaying aging and degenerative diseases in human and animals. In recent years, there is a growing demand for astaxanthin. The red yeast Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (called Phaffia rhodozyma before) is one of the most promising microorganisms for the commercial production of astaxanthin. During fermentation, X. dendrorhous shows the Crabtree effect. Higher glucose concentration will cause significant reductions in biomass and astaxanthin production. Therefore, fed-batch processes are particularly useful. In this paper, effects of glucose-feeding strategies on astaxanthin production by X. dendrorhous were studied. Based on the substrate inhibition model, an optimized two-stage feeding strategy for astaxanthin production of high-cell-density fermentation was proposed. Glucose concentration was first controlled at about 25 g/L during the lag phase and the early exponential phase. In such case, biomass could reach its maximum value in relatively short time. Then the glucose concentration was controlled at about 5 g/L in the later exponential phase and stationary phase. The synthesis of astaxanthin could be effectively prolonged. The results showed that the optimized two-stage feeding strategy was the best among all the feeding strategies, and could obtain the highest biomass (23.8 g/L) and astaxanthin production (29.05 mg/L), which was a significant increase (52.8% and 109% respectively) compared with a batch process. © 2008 Institute of Microbiology, CAS & CSM, All rights reserved.

The minimum detection concentration of selenium(IV) was 0.06 μg/mL and the measurable range was 0.12-12.0 μg/mL. The organic selenium accumulation in golden needle mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) mycelia was obtained by subtracting the amount of inorganic selenium from that of total selenium. The organic selenium accumulation of various inoculation amounts showed that organic selenium accumulation in a unit volume of the fermentation broth was positively related the inoculation amount.

To investigate the role of DNA methylation in the cultural course of Taxus chinensis cells, analyses of 18S rRNA gene sequences of cultured T. chinensis cells and related species were conducted. The phylogenetic analysis of 18S rRNA gene sequences indicated that HG-1 (the cultured T. chinensis cells), like T. mairei (the natural variety of T. chinensis), should be a new variety of T. chinensis, and cell culture can change the 18S rRNA gene sequence at the level of species despite 18S rRNA is the most conserved gene. The analyses of the CpG and TpG+CpA relative abundance and GC content of the 18S rRNA gene sequences made clear that DNA methylation contributed to changes of the 18S rRNA gene sequence of HG-1 at the level of species, which can make HG-1 to become a new variety of T. chinensis. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

A novel invariable feature extraction method, namely geometry projection based histogram model, is proposed for 3D model description. Different from the traditional method, one projection plane (or surface) is created for each 3D model, and the points of 3D models are projected to the projection plane (or surface), and then the distribution of distance between the original points of 3D model and the projected points on the projection plane (or surface) is analyzed with histogram model under the different resolution level. Each histogram model has its own projection plane (or surface) for the chosen projection method in advance. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm obtains the largest similar histogram models for the samples from the same class but the largest discriminative ability for the different class of samples compared with the current popular D1, D2, D3 methods. © 2009 IEEE.

In this method, a serials of ordinary differential equations which describe the working process of main combustor, bypass duct and afterburner are established and simplified. Time marching method is used to solve steady state, and explicit Euler method is used to calculate the transient process. The gas domain dynamics method is further developed. For the transient process, implicit scheme was employed to ensure convergence and to diminish the artificial vibration generated by second order difference scheme. A dual time step method was introduced to simplify the process of implicit calculation, as well as to shorten the time needed for solution in one time step. Simulation tests showed this new method was good in accuracy and robust. It can be used in real time simulation of aero-engine working at nonlinear high excursion condition.

76049088522	Fermentative production of L(+)-lactic acid using hydrolyzed acorn starch, persimmon juice and wheat bran hydrolysate as nutrients	The use of hydrolyzed acorn starch as a novel carbon source for L(+)-lactic acid production was proposed. The effects of carbon-nitrogen ratio and growth factor on the fermentations were studied by single factor experiments. A lower carbon-nitrogen ratio could enhance L(+)-lactic acid production, and the expensive yeast extract could be replaced by the cheap persimmon juice providing growth factor for L(+)-lactic acid production when wheat bran hydrolysate was used as the nitrogen source. The dosages of wheat bran hydrolysate and persimmon juice in the medium were statistically optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). The yield of L(+)-lactic acid reached 45.78 g/100 g dry acorn with a final concentration of 57.61 ± 1.37 g/l and a productivity of 1.60 ± 0.12 g/l h when the batch fermentation was carried out in a 5 l bioreactor under the optimal conditions of wheat bran hydrolysate 24.55 g/l and persimmon juice 12.30 g/l. Comparative batch fermentations using different raw materials such as acorn, cassava, corn and glucose showed that both the yield and the productivity of L(+)-lactic acid production were the highest when the hydrolyzed acorn starch was used as the carbon source. Therefore, the acorn could be used as a new substitute of grain raw material in L(+)-lactic acid production. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77951922812	Oxidative stress, molecular inflammation and sarcopenia	Sarcopenia is the decline of muscle mass and strength with age. Evidence suggests that oxidative stress and molecular inflammation play important roles in age-related muscle atrophy. The two factors may interfere with the balance between protein synthesis and breakdown, cause mitochondrial dysfunction, and induce apoptosis. The purpose of this review is to discuss some of the major signaling pathways that are activated or inactivated during the oxidative stress and molecular inflammation seen in aged skeletal muscle. Combined interventions that may be required to reverse sarcopenia, such as exercise, caloric restriction, and nutrition, will also be discussed. © 2010 by the authors.

77952549048	Studies on antibacterial activity and antibacterial mechanism of a novel polysaccharide from Streptomyces virginia H03	A novel polysaccharide isolated from the broth of Streptomyces virginia H03 exhibited strong antibacterial activities on food spoilage and food poisoning microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Zygosaccharomyces bailii and Candida utilis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the polysaccharide determined by the double broth dilution method were 15.6, 31.3, 31.3, 31.3, 125 and 125 (μg/ml) against the microorganisms mentioned above, respectively. The possible targets of the polysaccharide in bacteria might be cell wall, cytoplasmic membrane and DNA as indicated by electron microscopy, leakage of protein, cytoplasmic membrane permeability and DNA binding, respectively. Moreover, the antibacterial activity remained unchanged after being treated at 100 °C for 10. min, which indicated that the polysaccharide had a good heat-stability. In addition, it was safe according to mouse toxicity. All of these suggested that the polysaccharide might be used as a potential antimicrobial in food. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77954971150	Sequence analysis and expression of orf224 gene associated with two types of cytoplasmic male sterility in Brassica napus L.	Polima and Shaan 2A are the two most widely used forms of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in the utilization of heterosis of rapeseed (Brassica napus) in China. A previous study indicated that the mitochondrial gene, orf224, was the only gene with a differential expression pattern among the normal, sterile and fertility-restored lines in rapeseed. DNA sequences of orf224, including coding sequences from Shaan 2A and Polima CMS, were then amplified and analyzed. DNA sequence alignment indicated both the coding sequences were 675 bp in length and had 99.9 and 99% homology in nucleotides and amino acids, respectively, and shared certain similarity to homologues from other Brassica spp. and Arabidopsis thaliana. The probable promoter regions of orf224 were conserved between B. napus and A. thaliana, but the upstream regions of probable promoter regions were completely divergent from each other. Additionally, analysis of the primary and secondary structure of the proteins encoded by orf224 from the two lines predicted that the proteins contain a α-helix, extended strand, and random coil. After cloning a in vitro experiment showed that these two proteins could be expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. © 2010 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

77957329653	Optimization of embryogenic-callus induction and embryogenesis of Glycyrrhiza glabra	Glabridin is a major biologically active flavonoid isolated specifically from the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, which has many pharmacological activities. The production of the wild G. glabra was sharply decreased due to immoderate and ruinous utilization. In vitro regeneration via somatic embryogenesis is important for clonal propagation and genetic transformation. In this paper, factors affecting the embryogenic calli and embryo induction, maintenance and multiplication of G. glabra are assessed. The results showed that the explants of hypocotyl give the highest calli formation frequency of 93.3% on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 2.0 mg/L 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) and 0.5 mg/L 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The maximum efficiency of embryo were obtained on MS medium with 0.5 mg/L 6-BA + 0.5 mg/L kinetin zeatin (KT) + 0.1 mg/L indole-3-butyric acid (IBA); the embryos could develop further on medium with 1000 mg/L malt extract (ME). The occurrence of the embryogenic calli and proglobular embryo were studied by histological section, indicating the single cell origin of the embryogensis of G. glabra. With the protocol reported herein, some green embryo-like cultures were obtained, from which shoots were successfully regenerated in the germinated medium after 10 months of subculture. © 2010 Academic Journals.

78650305548	Lonicera confusa has an anatomical mechanism to respond to calcium-rich environment	Calcium (Ca) is an important nutrient element for plant growth and development. Nevertheless, excessive Ca restricts plant communities in Ca-rich environments. Lonicera confusa DC. is one species adapted to Ca-rich environments in the karst area of southwest China; however, the anatomical mechanism that allows these plants to respond to a Ca-rich environment remains unclear. L. confusa was cultivated in two types of soil with controlled Ca levels. The ultrastructure of leaves at different developmental stages was observed, and their Ca contents analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. There was no significant difference in leaves between the two experimental groups at very early stages of development. The glands of leaves growing in Ca-rich soil became saturated and showed a steady increase of Ca content in the following stages. The Ca level in leaf trichomes also increased steadily, compared with those from Ca-poor soil. When the leaves matured, Ca salts were excreted via stomata of L. confusa from Ca-rich soil. L. confusa had a special anatomical mechanism of responding to Ca-rich environments by excreting Ca salts via stomata, and storing Ca

78751522457	Factors influencing glabridin stability	Glabridin, a polyphenolic isoflavan of Glycyrrhiza glabra, has shown a variety of pharmaceutical properties. We have previously studied the isolation of glabridin using macroporous resin and found that it is partially degraded, giving a dark color. To illustrate the degradation of glabridin, the present work studied the stability of glabridin under various conditions. Licorice extract containing about 20% glabridin, obtained from G. glabra by silica gel column chromatography, was used in the stability study. Seven different factors (temperature, illumination, humidity, pH, solvent, oxygen, and oxidant) were studied and content changes were determined through HPLC analysis. Except for oxygen, all the above factors had an effect on the stability of glabridin, with illumination being the main one. Moreover, the interactions between temperature and pH, temperature and humidity, and illumination and pH can promote the degradation of glabridin. In conclusion, we suggest that a dark, dry and airtight environment provides the optimized condition for the long-term storage of glabridin.

79952002534	A new environmentally friendly method for astaxanthin extraction from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous	Few environmentally friendly solvents are available to extract food-grade astaxanthin. In this paper, some environmentally friendly solvents, such as lactic acid, ethyl lactate, and ethanol, were employed in cell disruption and astaxanthin extraction from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. The extraction procedure was optimized, validated and compared with other conventional extraction techniques. This method gave the best result due to the highest extraction efficiency within short extraction time. The optimum extraction conditions were as follows: the yeast cell wall was disrupted by lactic acid at 65° C for 1 h and then extracted with ethyl lactate:ethanol (1:1, v/v) for 0. 5 h. It was proved that the extraction efficiency was enhanced by the addition of the natural antioxidant α-tocopherol. This new method showed low chemical toxicity and gave high extraction efficiency, which had good prospects for mass production at the industrial scale. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

Based on the results of field investigation, we studied the effects of salinity on germination characteristics of four dominant species in wetland of Yellow River Delta, i.e. Suaeda salsa, Apocynum venetum, Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis.The germination conditions of the four dominant emerging plants at 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM NaCl were studied, the results indicated that all species had a trend of decreased germination percentage and rate of germination with the increase of salinity levels, but the inhibitory effect of salinity on the germination percentage of each was different. S. salsa and A. venetum had higher tolerance of salinity than P. australis and T. orientalis. Germination percentage and germination rate of seeds of the four species were significantly affected by salinity.In conclusion, the results of seeds germination of the four dominant species in the newly created wetland were accorded with the results of field investigation of plant community distribution along the gradients of environmental salinity, and salinity is one of the most pivotal factors limited the distribution of the plant vegetation in the newly created wetland of Yellow River Delta. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

79955067230	Effects of different pretreatment conditions on biogas production by anaerobic fermentation of cotton stalk	In order to search for fitting pretreatment methods in effective anaerobic fermentation of cotton stalks, effects of three pretreatments including high temperature, alkali treatment and microbial inoculation on biogas production by anaerobic fermentation of cotton stalks were studied. The pretreated cotton stalks were fermented in the biogas production experiments with total solid weight percentage of 8% under room temperature of (23 ± 2)°C. The results showed that in cotton stalks pretreated with NaOH and microbial inoculation, the structure of lignocellulose was broken clearly, while high temperature affected the external structure indistinctively. All the three pretreatments effectively shortened the starting period of anaerobic fermentation, and improved the ability to biogas production of cotton stalks. Effects of the three pretreatments on biogas production followed the order that: alkali treatment > high temperature > microbial inoculation. Of all the conditions, the pretreatment of 4%(w/w) NaOH with 10 days treating period for cotton stalks (with 60% moisture) exhibited the best effect, which could gain the total gas production of 31022.5 mL after 61 day fermentation. And in this fermentation, the daily average gas production achieved 508.57 mL/d, TS gas production and VS gas production reached 193.89 mL/g and 216.30 mL/g separately, which were much higher than those of the control and other pretreatments. This indicated that this kind of alkali treatment was the optimal, efficiently promoted biogas production in anaerobic fermentation of cotton stalks.

79954471405	Camptothecin distribution and content in Nothapodytes nimmoniana	Nothapodytes nimmoniana is an important anti-cancer medicinal plant which possesses various bioactive substances, of which camptothecin (CPT) is the most important. CPT is mainly obtained by extraction from plants. However, extraction is problematic because of the lack of reference information, which leads to a large number of trees being felled. In this study, CPT was detected in different parts (shoots, two- and three-year-old stems, tender leaves, mature leaves, senescent leaves, roots and bark) of N. nimmoniana. A high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was used to determine the CPT content. All parts analyzed contained CPT, but concentrations depended on the different growth phases of the stems and leaves. The highest CPT content was 1.87 mg/g from roots, followed by the shoots, with a content of 1.07 mg/g. With a view to resource utilization, we concluded that the shoots were the best tissues for exploitation. Suggestions for shoot picking are also provided.

A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring either pCAMBIA1303 or the recombinant plasmid p1303-SdbatN was used. Both plasmids harbored the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hptII) and gusA-mgfp5 gene as selectable markers, but the latter plasmid also harbored the dbat gene in the T-DNA region. The transgenic T. chinensis cells had been maintained in modified Gamborg's B5 medium supplemented with hygromycin for more than 14 months and were subcultured at 4-week intervals. The selected transgenic cells were identified by PCR, Southern blot analysis, β-glucuronidase assay and western blot analysis, and the results showed that the transgenes were integrated in the chromosomal DNA of T. chinensis cells with single-copy style, and that the gusA-mgfp5 reporter gene was expressed in the transgenic cells. The dbat mRNA expression level in the p1303-SdbatN-transgenic T. chinensis cells tested by real-time quantitative PCR was 5.3 ± 0.6 times that of the non-transformed cells. Taxol yield of the p1303-SdbatN-transgenic T. chinensis cells was about 1.7 times that of the non-transformed cells. These results suggest that the overexpression of dbat gene in transgenic T. chinensis cells leads to increased taxol yield. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Biotransformation of the inclusion complex of phytosterols and hydroxypropyl- β-cyclodextrin (PSs-HBβCD) by Mycobacterium neoaurum to 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione and 4-androstene-3,17-dione [AD(D)] was studied. The TGA and IR results indicated that the thermal stability of PSs was improved in the complex with HBβCD. Biotransformation improved the solubility of PSs in the aqueous medium a lot because the AD(D) production was increased remarkably compared with the control, but growth of the bacteria was inhibited in the presence of HBβCD. The optimal inclusion ratio, ultrasonic treating time, dosage, and time of addition of PSs-HBβCD complexe were found to be 2:1, 10 min, 1.5 g/30 ml medium, and 48 h after incubation, respectively. This inclusion technique not only increased the availability of the substrates for the microorganisms, but also the capability of these microorganisms to produce AD(D) from PSs. © 2011 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

However, the type of cell death induced in the tumour cells treated with MCPT was not elucidated. In this study, MCPT and camptothecin were isolated from Nothapodytes foetida distributed in Hubei Province, China and identified by NMR spectroscopy. MCPT was tested by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay using camptothecin as reference. Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double staining and real-time PCR were also performed. The IC50 value was (0.385 0.08) μM.

82055172792	The physiological response of suspension cell of Capparis spinosa l to drought stress	This study was conducted to investigate the drought tolerance and initial mechanism of Capparis spinosa L suspension cell to water stress. The suspension callus inoculated in liquid Murashige and Skoog medium contained 0 to 15% (m/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) and physiological index were assessed. The result indicated that drought stress led to hydrogen peroxide accumulation more than in the control which led the activities of peroxidase (POD) increased at low-concentration PEG treatment and then greatly declined. The soluble sugar followed the same trend, the content of fatty acid and total unsaturated fatty acid (TUFA) increased consequently. The longer and more severe the drought stress is, the higher the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), proline and soluble protein are. The study also demonstrated that when cells suffered more severe injury (over 8%), the soluble sugar, POD and unsaturated fatty acid exhibited decrease trend as cell membranes broke and endogenous protective enzyme activities decreased and MDA accumulated. © 2011 Academic Journals.

84856229458	Enhancement of pilot scale production of l(+)-lactic acid by fermentation coupled with separation using membrane bioreactor	Traditional batch fermentation leads to a higher energy consumption and lower production capability because of longer culture time. In this work, a pilot scale bioreactor composed of a 3000 L fermentor and external ceramic microfiltration equipment was used to perform cell-recycle fermentation. Repeat feeding medium was also used to relieve the substrate inhibition. In such pilot system, the maximum yield and productivity of l(+)-lactic acid production reached 157.22 ± 3.42 g/L and 8.77 ± 0.15 g/L/h which were 4.23% and 315.64% higher than those of batch fermentation, respectively, when equal amount of sugar was consumed. The cost of l(+)-lactic acid production was successfully reduced about two-thirds by the increase of yield and productivity. 12 rounds of cell-recycle fermentations were successfully achieved in the pilot system. The membrane filtration productivity reached to 61.27 ± 2.74 L/m

84860253172	Extracts of Lycoris aurea induce apoptosis in murine sarcoma S180 cells	Lycoris species have been known since long ago as a multi-utility ethnomedicinal herbal in China. It has been reported to exhibit a number of properties such as anticancer, neuroprotective, and antibacterial activities. In the present study, the anticancer efficacy of dichloromethane extracts of Lycoris aurea (DELA), was evaluated both in vivo and in vitro using murine sarcoma 180 cells. To evaluate the effects of DELA on apoptotic cell death, flow cytometry and Western blotting were performed. DELA demonstrated promising inhibition effects on sarcoma 180 cells in vitro and a 53.49% inhibitory rate on cancer cells in vivo. DELA treatment increased thymus indices and spleen indices in vivo, indicating that it reduced tumours, but did not damage the main immune organs. The DELA-evoked increase in apoptotic cell death was accompanied by occurrence of cleaved caspase-3 and decreases in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. Further purification and LCMS analysis showed DELA contained homolycorine, 2α-hydroxyoduline, oduline, hippeastrine, 2α-hydroxy-6- Omethyloduline, and 2α-methoxy-6-O-methyloduline. These results indicate that DELA exerted its anticancer effects, at least in part, by inducing cancer cell apoptosis and thus can be considered as a potential candidate agent for treatment of cancer. © 2012 by the authors.

84863091483	Transcriptional profile of Taxus chinensis cells in response to methyl jasmonate	Background: Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) has been successfully used as an effective elicitor to enhance production of taxol and other taxanes in cultured Taxus cells. However the mechanism of MeJA-mediated taxane biosynthesis remains unclear. Genomic information for species in the genus Taxus is currently unavailable. Therefore, information about the transcriptome of Taxus cells and specifically, description of changes in gene expression in response to MeJA, is needed for the better exploration of the biological mechanisms of MeJA-mediated taxane biosynthesis.Results: In this research, the transcriptome profiles of T. chinensis cells at 16 hours (T16) after MeJA treatment and of mock-treated cells (T0) were analyzed by " RNA-seq" to investigate the transcriptional alterations of Taxus cell in response to MeJA elicitation. More than 58 million reads (200 bp in length) of cDNA from both samples were generated, and 46,581 unigenes were found. There were 13,469 genes found to be expressed differentially between the two timepoints, including all of the known jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis/JA signaling pathway genes and taxol-related genes. The qRT-PCR results showed that the expression profiles of 12 randomly selected DEGs and 10 taxol biosynthesis genes were found to be consistent with the RNA-Seq data. MeJA appeared to stimulate a large number of genes involved in several relevant functional categories, such as plant hormone biosynthesis and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Additionally, many genes encoding transcription factors were shown to respond to MeJA elicitation.Conclusions: The results of a transcriptome analysis suggest that exogenous application of MeJA could induce JA biosynthesis/JA signaling pathway/defence responses, activate a series of transcription factors, as well as increase expression of genes in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway responsible for taxol synthesis. This comprehensive description of gene expression information could greatly facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MeJA-mediated taxane biosynthesis in Taxus cells. © 2012 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84863255604	Major biological activities of the skin secretion of the chinese giant salamander, Andrias davidianus	Amphibian skin can produce abundant secretion which contains many bioactive compounds. In this work, skin secretion of the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) was obtained by mild electrical stimulation of the dorsal skin surface, and the main physiopathological properties of the secretion were described. Intraperitoneal administration of the skin secretion caused lethal effects in mice. Low doses of the skin secretion induced signifycant systemic and local effects like edema and nociception in mice. The activities of phospholipase A2 and proteolytic enzyme were likely related to the physiopathological activities observed. The work proved the complex toxic effects of the Chinese giant salamander skin secretion and provided clues to study its physiological function further. © 2012 Verlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschung, Tübingen.

84863973411	Bio-based green composites with high performance from poly(lactic acid) and surface-modified microcrystalline cellulose	Bio-based green composites with high performance were prepared from poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and microcrystalline cellulose (MC) fibers grafted with l-lactic acid oligomers (g-MC). The chemical structure of g-MC was characterized by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and NMR methods, which indicate that l-lactic acid oligomers were successfully grafted onto MC. The grafting percentage of l-lactic acid oligomers is ca. 3.4%, and the average degree of polymerization of grafted l-lactic acid oligomers is ca. 10%. The improved compatibility between g-MC and PLA, caused by the grafting, results in an excellent dispersion of g-MC in the composites, and consequently a considerably improved transparence of the g-MC/PLA composites compared with that of the MC/PLA composites. In addition, due to the improved compatibility between g-MC and PLA, the g-MC/PLA composites exhibit better mechanical properties than pure PLA, with a high tensile strength of 70 MPa and a higher elongation at breakage. The enhanced properties, coupled with the excellent biocompatibility and degradability, offer the bio-based composites potential applications in biomedical fields and the packaging industry. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84864630938	Impact of an indigenous microbial enhanced oil recovery field trial on microbial community structure in a high pour-point oil reservoir	Based on preliminary investigation of microbial populations in a high pour-point oil reservoir, an indigenous microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) field trial was carried out. The purpose of the study is to reveal the impact of the indigenous MEOR process on microbial community structure in the oil reservoir using 16Sr DNA clone library technique. The detailed monitoring results showed significant response of microbial communities during the field trial and large discrepancies of stimulated microorganisms in the laboratory and in the natural oil reservoir. More specifically, after nutrients injection, the original dominant populations of Petrobacter and Alishewanella in the production wells almost disappeared. The expected desirable population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, determined by enrichment experiments in laboratory, was stimulated successfully in two wells of the five monitored wells. Unexpectedly, another potential population of Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes which were not detected in the enrichment culture in laboratory was stimulated in the other three monitored production wells. In this study, monitoring of microbial community displayed a comprehensive alteration of microbial populations during the field trial to remedy the deficiency of culture-dependent monitoring methods. The results would help to develop and apply more MEOR processes. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84865406854	Enhancing Taxol Biosynthesis by Overexpressing a 9-Cis-Epoxycarotenoid Dioxygenase Gene in Transgenic Cell Lines of Taxus chinensis	Plant secondary metabolites constitute are a wide range of compounds whose biosynthesis takes place in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts as an important signaling molecule that regulates plant response to various stresses. Moreover, 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is one of the key enzymes in the ABA biosynthesis pathway in higher plants. In this study, a new NCED gene from Taxus chinensis, the TcNCED1, was overexpressed in transgenic T. chinensis cells, resulting in a maximum of 48 % more accumulation of ABA and a 2. 7-fold increase of taxol production compared to the untransformed cells, respectively. These results indicate that overexpression of TcNCED1 can significantly increase the ABA and taxol level in T. chinensis cells, which probably provides an alternative approach in metabolic engineering to improve the yield of taxol in T. chinensis cells through genetic manipulation of the related genes in the ABA biosynthetic pathway. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

Contents of baccatin III and taxol in methanol extract were higher than those in ethanol extract. From methanol extract, 10 pure compounds were obtained through isolation and purification process combined with extraction and chromatographic analysis. Ingredients were structurally identified through methods of NMR, IR, MS and HPLC, and five compounds were ascertained as taxol, 1-accetyl-5,7, 10-deacetyl baccatin I, baccatin III, baccatin VI and 7,9,10,13-deacetyl baccatin VI of purity 98.4%, 98.7%, 99.1%, 99.65%, 92.94%, respectively. Moreover, extraction yield of taxol and baccatin III reached 62.6% and 57.6%, respectively. Results showed that the established preparation and purification technique could be applied to produce taxol and its precursors from T. chinensis leaves.

84868094743	Molecular Cloning and Characterization of Two 9-Lipoxygenase Genes from Taxus chinensis	Plant lipoxygenases (LOXs) are functionally diverse class of dioxygenases involved in multiple physiological processes such as plant growth, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and secondary metabolite accumulation. In this paper, two LOX genes, TcLOX1 and TcLOX2, were cloned from Taxus chinensis cells. Multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences with those of other plants demonstrated the putative LH2/PLAT domain, lipoxygenase iron-binding catalytic domain, lipoxygenase_1 and lipoxygenase_2 signature sequences. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that TcLOX1 and TcLOX2 putative proteins are most probably 9-LOXs, and shared the highest identity with the tea plant CsLOX1 and Picea sitchensis LOX genes, respectively. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that TcLOX1 was preferentially expressed in stem and root, while TcLOX2 was preferentially expressed in root. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that a strong upregulation of TcLOX1 was observed in response to methyl jasmonate and abscisic acid (ABA), while TcLOX2 was strongly upregulated by ABA. However, TcLOX1 and TcLOX2 were nearly not responding to salicylic acid. These data suggest both TcLOX1 and TcLOX2 play an important role in T. chinensis, and they are required in different physiological processes involved in different plant signals in vivo. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84868278402	Production of glycyrrhizin in cell suspension of Glycyrrhiza inflata Batalin cultured in bioreactor	Glycyrrhizin is the major constituent responsible for the quality of licorice, which is one of the most widely used chinese herbal medicines. Most previous studies of using cell cultures of licorice to produce pharmaceutical compounds are limited because these cultures have been optimized only on a small scale. In this study, cell suspension culture of Glycyrrhiza infata Batalin was established successfully in a 7.5 L bioreactor with a low-shear impeller. The maximum cell biomass of 194.4 g/L fresh weight was obtained after 18 days of culture in the bioreactor maintained at an initial inoculum density of 50 g/L fresh weight (FW) and aeration rate of 0.1 vvm. Analysis via liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed the presence of glycyrrhizin in the cell extract by comparison with the standards, and the glycyrrhizin content was found to be 1.14 ± 0.23 mg/g dry weight after 3 weeks of cultivation.

84868294021	Microbial diversity in long-term water-flooded oil reservoirs with different in situ temperatures in China	Water-flooded oil reservoirs have specific ecological environments due to continual water injection and oil production and water recycling. Using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis, the microbial communities present in injected waters and produced waters from four typical water-flooded oil reservoirs with different in situ temperatures of 25°C, 40°C, 55°C and 70°C were examined. The results obtained showed that the higher the in situ temperatures of the oil reservoirs is, the less the effects of microorganisms in the injected waters on microbial community compositions in the produced waters is. In addition, microbes inhabiting in the produced waters of the four water-flooded oil reservoirs were varied but all dominated by Proteobacteria. Moreover, most of the detected microbes were not identified as indigenous. The objective of this study was to expand the pictures of the microbial ecosystem of water-flooded oil reservoirs.

84870433755	Functional analysis of a WRKY transcription factor involved in transcriptional activation of the DBAT gene in Taxus chinensis	Although the regulation of taxol biosynthesis at the transcriptional level remains unclear, 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10 β-O-acetyl transferase (DBAT) is a critical enzyme in the biosynthesis of taxol. The 1740bp fragment 5′-flanking sequence of the dbat gene was cloned from Taxus chinensis cells. Important regulatory elements needed for activity of the dbat promoter were located by deletion analyses in T. chinensis cells. A novel WRKY transcription factor, TcWRKY1, was isolated with the yeast one-hybrid system from a T. chinensis cell cDNA library using the important regulatory elements as bait. The gene expression of TcWRKY1 in T. chinensis suspension cells was specifically induced by methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Biochemical analysis indicated that TcWRKY1 protein specifically interacts with the two W-box (TGAC) cis-elements among the important regulatory elements. Overexpression of TcWRKY1 enhanced dbat expression in T. chinensis suspension cells, and RNA interference (RNAi) reduced the level of transcripts of dbat. These results suggest that TcWRKY1 participates in regulation of taxol biosynthesis in T. chinensis cells, and that dbat is a target gene of this transcription factor. This research also provides a potential candidate gene for engineering increased taxol accumulation in Taxus cell cultures. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.

84871435641	Unstructured models for suspension cultures of Taxus media cells in a bioreactor under substrate-sufficient conditions	For a better understanding of the simulation, optimization, and process control in cell cultures, good kinetic models are necessary for large scale plant cell culture. In this paper, the systematic kinetics of taxol production by Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a stirred 15-L bioreactor under substrate-sufficient conditions and the absence of inducer intervention were studied. A kinetic model of cell growth was established by logistic equation, and kinetic unstructured models of substrate consumption, product synthesis and rheological behavior were constituted, which incorporated energy spilling. These models were verified by comparing the simulation results with those obtained experimentally. These results showed that energy spilling was a key factor that must be considered in constructing unstructured kinetic models of Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a stirred bioreactor under substrate-sufficient conditions. Besides, an optimized operation measure of decreasing energy spilling was proposed. An increase of 17.64% in cell biomass and 14.88% in taxol concentration were obtained when the strategy of limiting added carbon several times was experimentally implemented in a 15-L bioreactor. Results demonstrated that these established models should be helpful in the process prediction and operation optimization to guide the production and amplification of Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a bioreactor. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84872147426	Rheological properties of Taxus media cells suspension cultures grown in a bioreactor	In this paper, rheological properties of Taxus media cells suspension cultures in a bioreactor were investigated. The rheological equations were obtained by regression analysis. The results demonstrated that the suspension cultures broth of Taxus media cells at different fermentation time exhibited pseudoplastic non-Newtonian fluid, the broth apparent viscosity increased linearly with the increase in cell concentration and there was the linear functional relations between the apparent viscosity and the percentage aggregation. The pseudoplasticity and consistency coefficient of the broth increased with time from lag phase to stationary phase of cell growth. Subsequently, both appeared to decrease. At the same time the flow behavior index decreased with time from lag phase to stationary phase and increased during decline phase of cell growth. The results should be helpful in operation control, reactor design and amplification of Taxus media cell suspension cultures in a bioreactor.

84872296415	Pharmacokinetics and risk evaluation of DNA vaccine against Schistosoma japonicum	DNA plasmid immunization is a novel approach of preventive and therapeutic vaccine. More than 100 DNA vaccines have been on preclinical or clinical phase trials, and four kinds of DNA vaccines for livestock have been approved by USDA, CFIA, and APVMA. Schistosomiasis is a worldwide parasitic disease, and vaccine immunization is supposed to be a promising approach to control the health crisis. On the basis of former preclinical studies, we further focused on the pharmacokinetics and risk evaluation of DNA vaccine in vivo. In the present study, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) report gene was fused with Schistosoma japonicum 23 kDa transmembrane protein antigen gene (Sj23) and constructed into DNA vaccine pVIVO2-Sj23.EGFP. After intramuscularly injecting 100 μg of purified DNA vaccine plasmid to immunizate BALB/c mice, we studied the tissue distribution of DNA plasmid and expressed Sj23.EGFP antigen, the persistence time of elicited antibodies, and the risk of DNA vaccine transferred into intestinal microorganisms. The results showed that DNA vaccine plasmid could be distributed into all tissues of the body after injection; however, only few organs including the injected muscle were detected DNA vaccine at postimmunization until the 100 days by PCR technology; the detection of green fluorescence protein displayed that DNA vaccine could be expressed in almost every tissue and organs; the ELISA assay indicated the immune antibody against Sj23 could persist over 70 days; and the DNA vaccine transferring intestinal flora results was negative. The results indicated that the DNA vaccine has systemic protection and long-lasting effectivity and is safe to intestinal flora. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84873838804	Experimental study of the biochemistry method for enhancing oil recovery in the oil reservoir after polymer flooding	A delayed cross linked gel profile control agent is used to plug high permeable formations. Also, well nutrient fluid and microbes are injected with 50% of the heavy residual oil, after polymer flooding, in order to improve oil recovery due to the complex environment of oil reservoirs. Four strains of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are selected from oilfield produced water with a high efficiency. Two of the four strains, namely BISYX17 and BISYX14, are new. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria have high growth activity and they are able to reach a maximum stain concentration after being cultured 4 to 8 days, using phenanthrene as their sole carbon source. They are able to effectively degrade heavy hydrocarbon with a phenanthrene degradation rate of up to 80%, after the sample is cultured for seven days. Strain BISYX7 has the strongest phenanthrene-degrading ability, with a maximum degradation percentage of 89.89%. The strains are capable of producing dioxygenase to open rings of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The dioxygenase activity, produced by BISYX17, is able to reach 40.2 IU/mg, which is higher than the enzyme activities of a wild strain. This shows the strain has excellent potential to produce enzymes. Enzymes, produced by metabolism, have a direct degradation rate of 68% on crude oil. A core displacement simulation experiment indicates a profile control oil-displacing system is able to improve crude oil recovery efficiency by 17%, after polymer flooding. Thus, the system has excellent application potential for residual oil recovery. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84875270383	Response surface methodology used for investigating soluble organic selenium accumulation in yeasts	Selenium-enriched yeasts were usually regarded as an ideal organic selenium source. The study investigated the Soluble Organic Selenium (SOS) accumulation in three species of yeasts: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida rugosa and Candida utilis. The effects of main factors on organic selenium accumulation were evaluated. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Central Composite Design (CCD) were applied to optimize the dosage of main factors in fermentation medium. SOS content in the dry cells of C. utilis (1.31±0.065 mg/g) was higher than that of S. cerevisiae (1.20±0.057 mg/g) and C. rugosa (0.68±0.033 mg/g). However, as far as the productivity of per unit volume of broth was concerned, Candida rugosa also accumulated the most SOS (4.81±0.18 mg/L) among the three species of yeasts. Higher content of SOS in yeasts inhibited the cell growth and led to decrease of SOS per unit volume during yeasts fermentation. Perhaps, yeasts with lower content of SOS have the advantage of SOS accumulation per unit volume broth accumulation. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.

84875902957	Sustainable use of Taxus media cell cultures through minimal growth conservation and manipulation of genome methylation	Yields of paclitaxel decreased with repeated subculturing of Taxus media cells. We used minimal growth conservation and manipulation of genome methylation to sustain paclitaxel production by Taxus media cell cultures. The subculture period of Taxus cells can be prolonged to 180 d by incubating them at a low temperature (5 °C). Paclitaxel levels increased in the cells after conservation and during the first recovery subculture cycle, and then decreased during the subsequent recovery subculture cycle. Analysis of genetic variations in these cultures using amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) technology identified only two polymorphic bands associated with the second and sixth recovery cycle cultures. However, the results of high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that DNA methylation increased during the course of repeated subculturing. A decrease in DNA methylation level caused by treatment with 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine coincided with an increase in paclitaxel levels. Simultaneous exposure to both methyl jasmonate and 5-Aza-2′- deoxycytidine increased paclitaxel levels to 320.43 μg g

84879142745	Characterization of Pythium Transcriptome and Gene Expression Analysis at Different Stages of Fermentation	Background:The Pythium splendens is a potentially useful organism for the synthesis of large amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid. Peak biomass and lipid accumulation do not occur at the same time and growth temperature has an effect on the fatty acid composition. Little is known about the pathway or the genes involved in growth, lipid synthesis or temperature resistance in P. splendens. Analysis of the transcriptome and expression profile data for P.splendensRBB-5 were used to extend genetic information for this strain and to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in specific biological processes.Methodology/Principal Findings:This study used transcriptome assembly and gene expression analysis with short-read sequencing technology combined with a tag-based digital gene expression (DGE) system. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene descriptions, such as gene ontology (GO), clusters of orthologous group (COG) terms and KEGG orthology (KO) to generate 23,796 unigenes. In addition, we obtained a larger number of genes at different stages of fermentation (48, 100 and 148 h). The genes related to growth characteristics and lipid biosynthesis were analyzed in detail. Some genes associated with lipid and fatty acid biosynthesis were selected to confirm the digital gene expression (DGE) results by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).Conclusion/Significance:The transcriptome improves our genetic understanding of P.splendensRBB-5 greatly and makes a large number of gene sequences available for further study. Notably, the transcriptome and DGE profiling data of P.splendensRBB-5 provide a comprehensive insight into gene expression profiles at different stages of fermentation and lay the foundation for the study of optimizing lipid content and growth speed at the molecular level. © 2013 Zhu et al.

A new Bacillus pumilus HR19, which has the great ability to secrete pectinase, was screened and applied in the microbial treatment. Low-pressure steam expansion pretreatment (LSEP) was employed in advance to assist microbial treatment efficiently in releasing saponins, which are the precursors of diosgenin. Compared with the traditional process of acid hydrolysis, this novel process reduced the consumptions of water, acid and organic solvent by more than 92.5%, 97.0%, 97.0%, respectively, while simultaneously increasing the diosgenin yield by 6.21%. In addition, the microbial treatment was more efficient than enzymatic treatment, which arised from that microorganisms could be induced to secrete related enzymes by the compositions of DZW and relieve product inhibition by utilizing enzyme hydrolysates. © 2013 The Authors.

The spores decreased the dry weight and chlorophyll content of the leaves, but increased their malondialdehyde content; oligosaccharide induced similar but more moderate changes. The changes in soluble protein, phenolic content, and peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity were also analysed. Oligosaccharide significantly increased all these, whereas the spores had contrary effects. Results indicate that oligosaccharide, but not the fungal spores, elicited a defence reaction in T. chinensis. Possible reasons for these different effects on T. chinensis leaves in vitro are discussed.

84891798315	Identification of QTLs associated with oil content in a high-oil Brassica napus cultivar and construction of a high-density consensus map for QTLs comparison in B. napus	Increasing seed oil content is one of the most important goals in breeding of rapeseed (B. napus L.). To dissect the genetic basis of oil content in B. napus, a large and new double haploid (DH) population containing 348 lines was obtained from a cross between 'KenC-8' and 'N53-2', two varieties with >10% difference in seed oil content, and this population was named the KN DH population. A genetic linkage map consisting of 403 markers was constructed, which covered a total length of 1783.9 cM with an average marker interval of 4.4 cM. The KN DH population was phenotyped in eight natural environments and subjected to quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for oil content. A total of 63 identified QTLs explaining 2.64-17.88% of the phenotypic variation were identified, and these QTLs were further integrated into 24 consensus QTLs located on 11 chromosomes using meta-analysis. A high-density consensus map with 1335 marker loci was constructed by combining the KN DH map with seven other published maps based on the common markers. Of the 24 consensus QTLs in the KN DH population, 14 were new QTLs including five new QTLs in A genome and nine in C genome. The analysis revealed that a larger population with significant differences in oil content gave a higher power detecting new QTLs for oil content, and the construction of the consensus map provided a new clue for comparing the QTLs detected in different populations. These findings enriched our knowledge of QTLs for oil content and should be a potential in marker-assisted breeding of B. napus. © 2013 Wang et al.

10244232898	Bacteria biomass and carbonic anhydrase activity in some karst areas of Southwest China	To determine the role of microbes in karst processes, it is necessary to investigate the ecological distribution and characteristics of soil microorganisms in karst areas. In this paper, a preliminary study was carried out in two different karst areas of Southwest China: Nongla and the Guilin Yaji Karst Experimental Site (Guangxi). Soil samples from 10-20 cm in depth were analyzed for the number of bacteria, and the predominant bacteria were identified. Analysis showed that the amount of soil bacteria correlated highly with characteristics of the karst ecosystems, including their different geochemical environments and vegetation. The predominance of Azotobacteraceae colonies showed that the soil fertility of both types of karst areas may be improving. Also, the origin of carbonic anhydrase (CA), which could accelerate karst processes, was explored. The CA-producing bacteria were screened, and activities of extracellular and intracellular CA were measured. Obvious differences existed in intracellular and extracellular CA activities of soil bacteria between the two karst ecosystems with different vegetation conditions. This suggests that the activity of CA from soil bacteria in the two different karst areas was also correlated with karst ecosystem characteristics, including their different geochemical environments and vegetation features. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

1342285428	Test set optimization method based on ant algorithm	The increase of digital circuit integrity and complexity has made fault diagnosis of circuits more and more difficult. The scale of test set has become very large because of redundancy, which costs lots of time and memory unnecessarily. It is important to acquire optimal test set for test application. Test set optimization, which can eliminate the redundancy, is one of key problems in fault diagnosis of digital circuits. Ant colony optimization, a new kind of random optimization algorithm, has become a better alternative to genetic algorithm in some areas. That algorithm has such advantages as less parameters and simple operations, so it is easier to be adopted, We propose a method based on ant colony optimization that solves test set optimization better than classic algorithm or genetic algorithm. The better performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental results.
