1842791763	Frequency-dependent electromechanics of aqueous liquids: Electrowetting and dielectrophoresis	Electrowetting on dielectric and dielectrophoretic electromechanical mechanisms dominate microfluidic actuation in the low- and high-frequency limits, respectively. The frequency-dependent relationship between these two mechanisms has been clarified by the Maxwell stress tensor and a simple RC circuit model. In this paper, we report extensive height-of-rise measurements obtained with vertical, parallel, dielectrically coated electrodes to test this relationship using deionized water and solutions containing sugar and salt. For DC and AC (20 Hz to 20 kHz) voltage magnitudes up to ∼150 V-rms, the data are highly reproducible and, within experimental error, consistent with the square-law predictions of the model. Eventually as voltage is increased, a saturation phenomenon is observed which exhibits a weak dependence on frequency and is probably correlated to contact angle saturation.

23944491660	Electromigration in Pb-free Sn Ag3.8 Cu0.7 solder stripes	Electromigration behavior in the eutectic Sn Ag3.8 Cu0.7 solder stripes was investigated in the vicinity of the device operation temperature of 100 °C by using the edge displacement technique. Measurements were made for relevant parameters for electromigration of the solder, such as drift velocity, threshold current density, activation energy, as well as the product of diffusivity and effective charge number (D Z*). The threshold current densities were estimated to be 4.3× 104 A cm2 at 80 °C, 3.2× 104 A cm2 at 100 °C, and 1.4× 104 A cm2 at 120 °C. These values represent the maximum current densities that the Sn Ag3.8 Cu0.7 solder can carry without electromigration damage at the three stressing temperatures. The electromigration activation energy was determined to be 0.45 eV in the temperature range of 80-120 °C. The measured products of diffusivity and the effective charge number, D Z*, were -1.8× 10-10 cm2 s at 80 °C, -5.0× 10-10 cm2 s at 100 °C, and -7.2× 10-10 cm2 s at 120 °C. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

With the increase of applied current, the temperature increased rapidly due to Joule heating. Furthermore, modeling results indicated that a hot spot existed in the solder near the entrance point of the Al trace, and it became more pronounced as the applied current increased. The temperature difference between the hot spot and the solder was as large as 9.4 °C when the solder joint was powered by 0.8 A.

When joints with Al traces 100 μm wide were stressed by 1.0 A at 100°C, failure times were 35 h, 1,700 h, and >3,000 h for joints with Al traces that were 2,550 μm, 1,700 μm, and 850 μm long, respectively. Solder joints with Al traces 40 μm wide and 2,550 μm long failed instantly at 0.6 A. The Joule heating effect was found to be responsible for the huge difference in failure time.

37549015603	Micro-Rayleigh-Bénard convection polymerase chain reaction system	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular biological method for in vitro amplification of nucleic acids. Our objective was to design a micro-PCR system that included a Rayleigh-B́nard convection PCR chip, measurement circuits, and circuits to control the temperature. A Rayleigh-B́nard convection PCR chip was easily fabricated by using microelectromechanical system technology, and the sample solution could be put in to finish the completed PCR cycling within several minutes. The flow stream, velocity, and temperature profile in a micro-PCR system are important to achieve the successful PCR, but they are not easily observed with an experimental method. Thus, a CFDRC simulation of Rayleigh-B́nard convection PCR was undertaken to determine the above important parameters. The duration of one cycle, the extension time, and total duration of 25 cycles can be calculated to achieve the optimal design. Finally, using agarose-gel electrophoresis, we verified the practicability of this system. The comparison study of PCR experiments performed with a commercial PCR machine and our chips showed that our chips can greatly decrease the duration of the reaction. By comparing the simulation and PCR experiment results with varied designed sizes, a user can set the parameters and computational fluid dynamics results for optimal designs and decrease the total duration of future reactions. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

80052267397	An effective Seebeck coefficient obtained by experimental results of a thermoelectric generator module	This article proposes a concept of " effective Seebeck coefficient" , which discusses the inconsistency between the theoretical Seebeck coefficient and the measured one. The inconsistency can be explained via contact effect and thermal resistor network. Two different clamping forces are applied to the TEG module to observe the contact effect. Throughout the experiments, the electric resistance seems insensitive to the clamping force; somehow the thermal contact effect dominates the TEG module performance. In addition, a thermal resistor network, which is used to calculate the exact temperature difference traverse the TE ingot, has been constructed. After applying a suitable clamping pressure and modifying the actual Δ. T with thermal resistor network, the " effective Seebeck coefficient" has been proposed. Notably, this proposed value is very helpful for better understanding characteristics of the behavior of the TEG module operating in the actual conditions we provided, and it can be used to predict the performance of the TEG module under any other condition. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84887554388	Isolation of Motile Spermatozoa with a Microfluidic Chip Having a Surface-Modified Microchannel	Conventional methods to prepare sperm have been amenable to the investigation of outcomes such as rates of recovery and conventional semen parameters. The standard preparation of sperm for assisted reproduction is criticized for its centrifugation steps, which might either recover motile sperm in variable proportions or increase the probability of damage to sperm DNA. An microfluidic system was designed to separate motile sperm according to a design whereby nonmotile spermatozoa and debris flow along their initial streamlines and exit through one outlet-up, whereas motile spermatozoa have an opportunity to swim into a parallel stream and to exit through a separate outlet-down. This chip was fabricated by microelectromechanical systems technology with polydimethylsiloxane molding. The hydrophilic surface, coated with poly (ethanediol) methyl ether methacrylate, exhibits enduring stability maintained for the microchannel. Microscopic examination and fluorescent images showed that the motility of sperm varied with the laminar streams. To confirm the sorting, we identified and quantified the proportions of live and dead sperm before and after sorting with flow cytometric analysis. The results on the viability of a sample demonstrated the increased quality of sperm after sorting and collection in the outlet reservoir. The counted ratio of live sperm revealed the quantity and efficiency of the sorted sperm. © 2013 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.

The approach took a simple way to calculate the pressure drops, which could reduce the necessity of an embedded pressure sensor inside microchannel. The concept was to design the rectangular branch-channel along the side wall of main flow in the microchannel. When the fluidic flowed through the microchannel, the bubbles would be formed inside the branchchannel. By observing the changes of the bubbles sizes, the pressure drops around the particular sites of the branch-channel could be estimated. As the experiment results, we could indirectly obtain the pressure drops of the micro fluidic around the micro channel by the changes of the bubbles sizes. In addition to demonstrate the estimating of the pressure drops and the concept of the branch-channel design, it has also supported a frame of the channel sizes and the pressure drops to design the proper microchannel.

51449120619	Conversion of surface energy and manipulation of a single droplet across micropatterned surfaces	To clarify a driving mechanism for the self-movement of a droplet across hydrophobic textured surfaces in series and to develop applications for a microfluidic device, we report a theoretical model, a microfabrication technique, and experimental measurements. The contact angle of a droplet on a composite surface, the stable surface energy level, and the energy barrier caused by hysteresis were investigated. With increasing patterned density of the microstructure, the contact angle and stable surface energy decreased gradually, but the energy barrier increased. Both the analytical' results and the experimental measurements show that the surface energy for a suspended status is greater than that for a collapsed status, which produces increased energy to generate the movement of a droplet. An analysis of interactions between actuation force, resistive force, and viscous force during the motion of a droplet is based on the equilibrium between forces. From the perspective of energy conversion, the difference in surface energy between a higher state and a lower state would drive a single droplet and make it move spontaneously if it could overcome the static friction force resulting from hysteresis and the kinetic friction force under droplet movement.

Yet, there are no experimental data to verify it. In this paper, the temperature distribution during electromigration in flip-chip SnAg3.5 solder bumps is directly inspected using infrared microscopy. Two clear hot spots are observed in the bump. One is located at the region with peak current density and the other one is at the bump edge under the current-feeding metallization on the chip side. Under a current stress of 1.06× 104 A cm2, the temperature in the two hot spots are 161.7 and 167.8 °C, respectively, which surpass the average bump temperature of 150.5 °C. In addition, the effect of under-bump-metallization (UBM) thickness on the hot spots is also examined. It indicates that the hot-spot temperature in the solder bump increases for the solder joints with a thinner UBM. Electromigration test indicates that these hot spots have significant influence on the initial failure location. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

This method is developed based on a logarithmic relation regarding the difference of the total thermal resistances and the ratio of the film thicknesses between two similar systems. Such a logarithmic relation is supported by theoretical analysis and is analogous to that appearing in the steady heat diffusion problem between two concentric cylinders. Its accuracy is confirmed to be acceptable when the film thickness is large enough compared to the heating-wire width and small enough compared to the substrate width. The error analysis shows that the relative errors are under 1% for all film Biot numbers greater than 60. Finally, an associated experiment is also set up, and the measurement results confirm the accuracy of the proposed thickness difference method. © 2010 IEEE.

78649302871	A novel method for measuring thick film thermal conductivity	We describe a novel method to measure the thermal conductivity of thick films. Based on the analytical solution of a comprehensive 2-D film-substrate heat diffusion problem, we derived a simple empirical solution for determination of the thick-film thermal conductivity. We use the negative photoresist SU-8 as a thick film material, the use of lithography process and a simple instrument that can be obtained from the measurement system, allowing measurements of SU-8 thick-film thermal conductivity coefficient of 0.21 W / mK.

78649242946	A large uniform monolayer area obtained by droplet evaporation in microwells	Nanosphere lithography has potential in many areas, and there have been many methods that deposit the colloidal suspension onto the substrate. However, it is important and still difficult to control the uniformity of the monolayer on a plane substrate. In this study, we have found a method for a uniform monolayer of polystyrene beads by confining the droplets with microwells. By simply controlling the droplet size and the colloidal concentration, the largest monolayer area could be obtained. In our application, the monolayer of polystyrene beads on substrate was used as a mask through which gold films were deposited. After removal of the polystyrene beads, an array of triangular Au patterns was left on the substrate. These samples were subsequently annealed, which resulted in gold nanoparticles arrays. ©2010 IEEE.

78650347792	Investigation of joule heating effect in various stages of electromigration in flip-chip solder joints by infrared microscopy	The Joule heating effect at various stages under electromigration of flip-chip Sn3.5Ag solder joints was investigated under a current of 0.5 A at 100°C. During various stages of electromigration, voids may form and propagate and Joule heating effect may vary at different void sizes. To verify the void nucleation and propagation on Joule heating effect during electromigration process, the solder bump was stressed for different lengths of time and then examined by Kelvin bump probes and infrared microscopy. We found that voids started to form at approximately 1.2 times of the initial bump resistance. Then the voids propagated when the bump resistance increased. In addition, the temperature of the solder joints increased with the bump resistance and the increase of current stressing time. It increased very slowly in initial stages. In the last stage, the temperature of the solder bump increased rapidly due to the increase of the bump resistance and the local Joule heating effect. © 2010 Materials Research Society.

78650085399	Hydrophilic modification of neural microelectrode arrays based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes	To decrease the impedance of microelectrode arrays, for neuroscience applications we have fabricated and tested MEA based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes. With decreasing physical size of a microelectrode, its impedance increases and charge-transfer capability decreases. To decrease the impedance, the effective surface area of the electrode must generally be increased. We explored the effect of plasma treatment on the surface wettability of MWCNT. With a steam-plasma treatment the surface of MWCNT becomes converted from superhydrophobic to superhydrophilic; this hydrophilic property is attributed to-OH bonding on the surface of MWCNT. We reported the synthesis at 400 °C of MWCNT on nickel-titanium multilayered metal catalysts by thermal chemical vapor deposition. Applying plasma with a power less than 25 W for 10 s improved the electrochemical and biological properties, and circumvented the limitation of the surface reverting to a hydrophobic condition; a hydrophilic state is maintained for at least one month. The MEA was used to record neural signals of a lateral giant cell from an American crayfish. The response amplitude of the action potential was about 275 μV with 1 ms period; the recorded data had a ratio of signal to noise up to 40.12 dB. The improved performance of the electrode makes feasible the separation of neural signals and the recognition of their distinct shapes. With further development the rapid treatment will be useful for long-term recording applications. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Simulations and experiments for the thermoelectric module in this system are undertaken to assess the feasibility of these applications. In order to estimate the temperature difference between thermoelectric elements, a network of thermal resistors is constructed. The results assist in predicting power output of TEG module more precisely. Three configurations of heat sinks, which are comprised of 10, 22, and 44 fins, are applied in this simulation. The results of the simulations show the average thermal resistance of these heat sinks in each section of the system with varied velocity of external flow. As the performance of a TEG module is influenced by an applied pressure through the effect of the thermal contact resistance, we clamp the TE module to our experimental apparatus; the relation between power output and pressure applied in this case is presented. Besides simulations, the system is designed and assembled. Measurements followed the connection of the system to the middle of an exhaust pipe.

79952989873	Effect of Si-die dimensions on electromigration failure time of flip-chip solder joints	Electromigration tests were performed for solder joints with various Si dies thickness and area. For the electro-migration in flip-chip solder joints with a 60, 100, 250 and 760 μm thick Si die, it is found that Si-die thickness has profound influence on electro-migration lifetime. The average failure time was 1608.0 h for joints with a 760-μm-thick die when they are stressed by 1.0 A at 100 °C. However, it decreased significantly to 0.6 h for joints with a 60-μm-thick die. According to the temperature measured by infrared microscopy, solder joints with a thinner die has a higher Joule heating effect, which results in a shorter electromigration lifetime. In addition, the die area has a considerable influence on the electromigration failure time. The electromigration failure time decreases as the die area decreases. The average failure time is 1608.0, 28.0, 10.6, 5.0 and 0.3 h for the solder joints with die area of 5350 × 4350 μm

79954441548	A three-dimensional flexible microprobe array for neural recording assembled through electrostatic actuation	We designed, fabricated and tested a novel three-dimensional flexible microprobe to record neural signals of a lateral giant nerve fiber of the escape circuit of an American crayfish. An electrostatic actuation folded planar probes into three-dimensional neural probes with arbitrary orientations for neuroscientific applications. A batch assembly based on electrostatic forces simplified the fabrication and was non-toxic. A novel fabrication for these three-dimensional flexible probes used SU-8 and Parylene technology. The mechanical strength of the neural probe was great enough to penetrate into a bio-gel. A flexible probe both decreased the micromotion and alleviated tissue encapsulation of the implant caused by chronic inflammation of tissue when an animal breathes or moves. The cortex consisted of six horizontal layers, and the neurons of the cortex were arranged in vertical structures; the three-dimensional microelectrode arrays were suitable to investigate the cooperative activity for neurons in horizontal separate layers and in vertical cortical columns. With this flexible probe we recorded neural signals of a lateral giant cell from an American crayfish. The response amplitude of action potentials was about 343 V during 1 ms period; the average recorded data had a ratio of signal to noise as great as 30.22 ± 3.58 dB.

79956034367	Laminar stream-based microfluidic chip with high efficiency for human sperm motility sorting	A novel laminar stream-based microfluidic chip that can serve as the high efficient technique for human sperm motility sorting through the use of flow cytometry was proposed in this study. Recently, the selection of good sperms in semen plays an important role in the reproductive medicine. However, the traditional sorting methods are normally expensive and time consuming. This modified microfluidic chip provided a new selection, which had advantages of low-cost, high-precision, and disposable. This paper was proposed and tested the interactions between laminar flow and sperm activity. Due to the laminar flow in a different direction, the semen samples were loaded into a curve laminar flow through straight-curve stream and it would offer a y component force for dead sperms to be selected. In addition, the semen samples were loaded into a straight laminar flow and the results showed that most of the proportion of motile sperms with lateral activity can swim across the two fluid boundaries to be sorted. From the results of flow cytometry analysis, the injected semen sample from a straight inlet with the counted percentage of living sperms was 92.68% by the observation in outlet reservoir. Therefore, the microfluidic chip with remarkable sperm motility sorting has the potential for reproductive medicine. © 2010 IEEE.

79957955125	An active, flexible carbon nanotube microelectrode array for recording electrocorticograms	A variety of microelectrode arrays (MEAs) has been developed for monitoring intra-cortical neural activity at a high spatio-temporal resolution, opening a promising future for brain research and neural prostheses. However, most MEAs are based on metal electrodes on rigid substrates, and the intra-cortical implantation normally causes neural damage and immune responses that impede long-term recordings. This communication presents a flexible, carbon-nanotube MEA (CMEA) with integrated circuitry. The flexibility allows the electrodes to fit on the irregular surface of the brain to record electrocorticograms in a less invasive way. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) further improve both the electrode impedance and the charge-transfer capacity by more than six times. Moreover, the CNTs are grown on the polyimide substrate directly to improve the adhesion to the substrate. With the integrated recording circuitry, the flexible CMEA is proved capable of recording the neural activity of crayfish in vitro, as well as the electrocorticogram of a rat cortex in vivo, with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, the proposed CMEA can be employed as a less-invasive, biocompatible and reliable neuro-electronic interface for long-term usage. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The zirconium-containing platelet SBA-15 was used as hard template to prepare CMK-5-like carbon, which was then applied as a lightweight and high-surface-area scaffold for the growth of polymers by radical polymerization. Mesoporous nanocomposites composed of four different polymers were used as sensing materials for surface acoustic wave devices to detect ppm-level ammonia gas.

84865253654	Applications of EWOD systems for DNA reaction and analysis	A digital microfluidic system based on electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) technology has attracted considerable attention because of its promising potential in biological, biochemical and biomedical applications. The digital microfluidic (EWOD) system enables a discrete droplet to be manipulated through reconfig-urable paths or channels defined by electrode actuation. Minute sample and reagent volume, precise droplet control, low energy consumption, low cost, rapid analysis, portablility for point-of-care diagnosis, flexibility for integrating with detector, multiple-step and simultaneous reaction processes are all advantages of EWOD system. Thus, it has become a promising and popular tool for bio-applications such as cell assays, proteomics, enzyme assays, immunoassays, DNA extraction, DNA repair and DNA amplification. In DNA-based applications, ordinarily, the DNA replication (e.g., DNA amplification) is necessary. Among the DNA replication techniques, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) because of its simplicity and cost-effectiveness is the most common laboratory technique. Therefore, the development of EWOD-based microfluidic PCR system combined with other novel techniques for DNA amplification or DNA-based assays has extensively been reported. In this paper, the recent developments and studies of EWOD microfluidic system for DNA-based applications published in the last five years have been reviewed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84867234506	Fission and fusion of droplets in a 3-D crossing microstructure	We demonstrate a 3-D crossing microstructure that has simple and versatile features for the fission and fusion of droplets. For their fission, the size of daughter droplets is readily controllable solely on modulating the ratio of flow rates at the inlets. We observed two distinct scenarios of droplet fission and propose dripping-like and squeezing-like mechanisms to explain such anomalous phenomena. Depending on the width of the outlet channel, the microstructure exhibits chronologically differentiated dynamics of droplet fusion and fission, leading to diverse droplet mixing. With this microstructure, droplets of diverse size and concentration can be accordingly produced from two individual droplets of distinct constituents. As the 3-D structure allows for both droplet dispersion and mixing, it is beneficially applicable for biochemical and biomedical applications such as drug dosing and drug delivery. Diverse droplet manipulations are realized with this 3-D crossing microstructure, shedding new light on droplet-based microfluidic systems. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84879796424	Two-dimensional thermal resistance analysis of a waste heat recovery system with thermoelectric generators	In this study, it is shown that two-dimensional (2D) thermal resistance analysis is a rapid and simple method to predict the power generated from a waste heat recovery system with thermoelectric generators (TEGs). Performance prediction is an important part of system design, generally being simulated by numerical methods with high accuracy but long computational duration. Use of the presented analysis saves much time relative to such numerical methods. The simple 2D model of the waste heat recovery system comprises three parts: a recovery chamber, the TEGs and a cooling system. A fin-structured duct serves as a heat recovery chamber, to which were attached the hot sides of two TEGs; the cold sides were attached to a cooling system. The TEG module and duct had the same width. In the 2D analysis, unknown temperatures are located at the centroid of each cell into which the system is divided. The relations among the unknown temperatures of the cells are based on the principle of energy conservation and the definition of thermal resistance. The temperatures of the waste hot gas at the inlet and of the ambient fluid are known. With these boundary conditions, the unknown temperatures in the system become solvable and the power generated by the TEGs can be predicted. Meanwhile, a three-dimensional (3D) model of the system was simulated in FloTHERM 9.2. The 3D numerical solution matched the solution of the 2D analysis within 10%. © 2013 TMS.

The HEMTs with metal on the gate region showed good current stability in deionized water, while a large fluctuation in drain current was observed for HEMTs without gate metal. The fluctuation in drain current for the HEMTs without gate metal was observed and calculated as standard deviation from a real-time measurement in air, deionized water, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylene glycol, 1,2-butanediol, and glycerol. At room temperature, the fluctuation in drain current for the HEMTs without gate metal was found to be relevant to the dipole moment and the viscosity of the liquids. A liquid with a larger viscosity showed a smaller fluctuation in drain current. The viscosity-dependent fluctuation of the drain current was ascribed to the Brownian motions of the liquid molecules, which induced a variation in the surface dipole of the gate region. This study uncovers the causes of the fluctuation in drain current of HEMTs in fluids. The results show that the AlGaN/GaN HEMTs may be used as sensors to measure the viscosity of liquids within a certain range of viscosity. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84896502432	Single mouse oocyte encapsulated in medium-in-oil microdroplets by using a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic device	A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flow-focusing microfluidic device was used to generate micrometer medium-in-oil microdroplets, and a single mouse oocyte was encapsulated in each dispersed microdroplet for in vitro fertilization (IVF) research. The droplet-based microfluidics provides a dynamic and noncontinuous culture condition for mimicking the in vivo cell development environment. Cell culture in monodispersed microdroplets requires less medium volumes, reduces cell culture cost, prevents contamination risk, and minimizes evaporation. This PDMS microfluidic channel contains two inlets for continuous oil injection and medium injection with oocytes. The oocyte in the culture medium was embedded into microdroplets by shear force and dispersed in the oil phase. The volume of microdroplets can be controlled by adjusting the flow rates of both oil and medium inlets. After microdroplets containing a single oocyte were generated stably into the outlet of the microfluidic channel, the microdroplets could be collected in a tube for further biomedical applications.

84896627711	A multilayer concentric filter device to diminish clogging for separation of particles and microalgae based on size	Microalgae species have great economic importance; they are a source of medicines, health foods, animal feeds, industrial pigments, cosmetic additives and biodiesel. Specific microalgae species collected from the environment must be isolated for examination and further application, but their varied size and culture conditions make their isolation using conventional methods, such as filtration, streaking plate and flow cytometric sorting, labour-intensive and costly. A separation device based on size is one of the most rapid, simple and inexpensive methods to separate microalgae, but this approach encounters major disadvantages of clogging and multiple filtration steps when the size of microalgae varies over a wide range. In this work, we propose a multilayer concentric filter device with varied pore size and is driven by a centrifugation force. The device, which includes multiple filter layers, was employed to separate a heterogeneous population of microparticles into several subpopulations by filtration in one step. A cross-flow to attenuate prospective clogging was generated by altering the rate of rotation instantly through the relative motion between the fluid and the filter according to the structural design of the device. Mixed microparticles of varied size were tested to demonstrate that clogging was significantly suppressed due to a highly efficient separation. Microalgae in a heterogeneous population collected from an environmental soil collection were separated and enriched into four subpopulations according to size in a one step filtration process. A microalgae sample contaminated with bacteria and insect eggs was also tested to prove the decontamination capability of the device. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84898079358	24.5 A 0.5V 1.27mW nose-on-a-chip for rapid diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia	Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequently acquired infection among patients that receive mechanical ventilation in the intensive-care unit (ICU). The mortality rate for VAP lies in the 20-to-50% range and could be even higher in some ICUs. A standard operation procedure to VAP treatment includes a sequence of chest radiography, sputum gram stain, sputum culture, and empiric therapy, initially with antibiotics covering broad pathogens. However, collection of the gram stain and culture of lower respiratory tract specimen is usually not time-efficient (up to 5 days), delaying the initiation of therapy and unacceptable for critically ill patients. A rapid and accurate diagnosis for VAP is therefore crucial, but still unavailable. It is known that microorganisms generate complex metabolites during infection. Fast detection is feasible by examining metabolic wastes in proximal end of the expiratory device, demanding a miniaturized, battery-powered, gas-sensing device. In this work, a fully integrated low-power nose-on-a-chip with a robust learning kernel is developed for such a vital clinical need. © 2014 IEEE.

84899980581	EWOD microfluidic systems for biomedical applications	As the technology advances, a growing number of biomedical microelectromechanical systems (bio-MEMS) research involves development of lab-on-a-chip devices and micrototal analysis systems. For example, a portable instrument capable of biomedical analyses (e.g., blood sample analysis) and immediate recording, whether the patients are in the hospital or home, would be a considerable benefit to human health with an excellent commercial viability. Digital microfluidic (DMF) system based on the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) mechanism is an especially promising candidate for such point-of-care systems. The EWOD-based DMF system processes droplets in a thin space or on an open surface, unlike the usual microfluidic systems that process liquids by pumping them in microchannels. Droplets can be generated and manipulated on EWOD chip only with electric signals without the use of pumps or valves, simplifying the chip fabrication and the system construction. Microfluidic operations by EWOD actuation feature precise droplet actuation, less contamination risk, reduced reagents volume, better reagents mixing efficiency, shorter reaction time, and flexibility for integration with other elements. In addition, the simplicity and portability make the EWOD-based DMF system widely popular in biomedical or chemical fields as a powerful sample preparation platform. Many chemical and biomedical researches, such as DNA assays, proteomics, cell assays, and immunoassays, have been reported using the technology. In this paper, we have reviewed the recent developments and studies of EWOD-based DMF systems for biomedical applications published mostly during the last 5 years. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84901920783	Model for increasing the power obtained from a thermoelectric generator module	We have developed a model for finding the most efficient way of increasing the power obtained from a thermoelectric generator (TEG) module with a variety of operating conditions and limitations. The model is based on both thermoelectric principles and thermal resistance circuits, because a TEG converts heat into electricity consistent with these two theories. It is essential to take into account thermal contact resistance when estimating power generation. Thermal contact resistance causes overestimation of the measured temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of a TEG in calculation of the theoretical power generated, i.e. the theoretical power is larger than the experimental power. The ratio of the experimental open-loop voltage to the measured temperature difference, the effective Seebeck coefficient, can be used to estimate the thermal contact resistance in the model. The ratio of the effective Seebeck coefficient to the theoretical Seebeck coefficient, the Seebeck coefficient ratio, represents the contact conditions. From this ratio, a relationship between performance and different variables can be developed. The measured power generated by a TEG module (TMH400302055; Wise Life Technology, Taiwan) is consistent with the result obtained by use of the model; the relative deviation is 10%. Use of this model to evaluate the most efficient means of increasing the generated power reveals that the TEG module generates 0.14 W when the temperature difference is 25°C and the Seebeck coefficient ratio is 0.4. Several methods can be used triple the amount of power generated. For example, increasing the temperature difference to 43°C generates 0.41 W power; improving the Seebeck coefficient ratio to 0.65 increases the power to 0.39 W; simultaneously increasing the temperature difference to 34°C and improving the Seebeck coefficient ratio to 0.5 increases the power to 0.41 W. Choice of the appropriate method depends on the limitations of system, the cost, and the environment. © 2014 TMS.

84903471353	Motile human sperm sorting by an integrated microfluidic system	The integrated microfuidic system consists of laminar stream-based microchannels and flow cytometric analysis to enhance the human sperm motility sorting efficiency. This modified sperm sorter provided a new selection that had advances in resolving traditional sorting problems. In order to design the sorting sorting device, CFDRC simulation was performed to analyze the phenomenon of 3-D flow field. Microscopic examination revealed that sperms with different motility. For the purpose of confirming the real sorting situation, the proportions of living and dead sperm after sorting were readily identified and quantified through use of flow cytometric analysis. The viability results of sample injected from two-outlet and four-outlet chip were 95.2% and 92.2% that presented the higher quality of sorting sperm. As a result, more amounts of living sperms that mean motile sperms were counted in four-outlet channels. With this approach, the characteristics of laminar flow and a novel design were utilized to demonstrate the microfuidic system with high efficiency for sperm motility sorting. Therefore, the optimized microfuidic system provides a good opportunity to use and an inexpensive requirement to select the most appropriate sperms before IVF (in vitro fertilization) process. © 2014 Huang HY, et al.

84907247024	Cost-effective and highly sensitive cholesterol microsensors with fast response based on the enzyme-induced conductivity change of polyaniline	In this study, a cost-effective and highly sensitive cholesterol microsensor, which is consisted of cholesterol oxidase (ChOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and polyaniline (PANI), was developed based on the enzyme-induced conductivity change of PANI with fast response. Hydrogen peroxide is produced via the reaction between cholesterol and ChOx, which was immobilized in a dialysis membrane. The produced hydrogen peroxide can oxidize HRP, which can be reduced by oxidizing PANI, thus resulting in decreased conductivity of the polyaniline thin film. The reduced HRP can be oxidized again by hydrogen peroxide and the cycle of the oxidation/reduction continues until all hydrogen peroxide are reacted, leading to the high sensitivity of the sensor due to the signal contributed from all hydrogen peroxide molecules. Cholesterol was detected near the physiological concentrations ranging from 100-mg/dl to 400-mg/dl with the cholesterol microsensors. The results show linear relation between cholesterol concentration and the conductivity change of the PANI. The microsensor showed no response to cholesterol when the PANI was standalone without cholesterol oxidase immobilized, indicating that the enzymatic reaction is required for cholesterol detection. The simple process of the sensor fabrication allows the sensor to be cost-effective and disposable usage. This electronic cholesterol microsensor is promising for point-of-care health monitoring in cholesterol level with low cost and fast response.

84907599658	Monolayer uniformity of the nanosphere mask: Two-dimensional ordered gold nanoparticle arrays with nanosphere lithography	Nanosphere lithography (NSL) is a simple, effective, and convenient technique for the fabrication of nanoholes, pillar structures, and nanoparticles. An optimal parameter is required for each procedure to fabricate the desired nanostructure, especially for optoelectronic applications to increase their optoelectronic conversion efficiency or some biomedical detection. We produced arrays of gold (Au) nanoparticles with these particles smaller than 100 nm for an application; hence, we focused on precise control in every step. With an innovative method, the step of droplet evaporation in microwells, the monolayer of polystyrene (PS) bead mask achieved great uniformity. By simply adjusting the droplet size and the colloidal concentration, we obtained the largest monolayer area. The monolayer of PS beads on the substrate served as a mask through which Au films were deposited. As a water film occurred on the PS beads that might block the Au deposit onto the substrate, the PS beads had to be treated with an oxygen (O2) plasma to enlarge the interstices between them. The thickness of the Au deposited was tuned to fabricate annealed nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm. According to this control, the Au nanoparticles were small and formed highly dense arrays. © 2014 IEEE.

84907356309	Improved surface acoustic wave sensor for low concentration ammonia/methane mixture gases detection	In this research, we used the surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor to detect chemical compounds such as ammonia, methane, and ammonia-methane mixture gases. Very low concentration of ammonia (∼250 ppb) and methane (∼9 ppm) can be detected by our SAW devices. And we used mesoporous carbon hollow nanosphere in Poly-N-vinylpyrrolidone (PNVP) film to increase the sensitivity to ammonia from 6.91 to 19.47 Hz/ppm. Besides, the signal loss is less than 6% after 17 detection cycles. Finally, we compared the response of ammonia and methane with ammonia/methane mixtures, finding synergy effect between these different gases by PNVP sensing film.

84908653579	Using TD-GC-MS to analyze coffee beans aromas of different roast levels	An analytical methodology using Thermal Desorption (TD) and GC-MS was developed for the determination of components in coffee beans aromas. The purpose was to estimate the volatile compounds/components in coffee beans aromas of different roast levels, such as light, medium, medium-dark, and dark roast. Aromas samples were collected by using stainless steel tubes containing approximately 200 mg of Tenax TA adsorbents and sampling at a flow rate of 200 mL/min. Seventeen major components in coffee beans aromas were identified by the TD-GC-MS system. Results showed that most components increased with roast levels. However, furfurals had a different downward trend. Chemical reactions occurred during the roasting process were proposed to explain the decrease in furfurals: furfurals changed to 2-furanmethanol and 2-methylfuran.

10044228341	Thermal gradient in solder joints under electrical-current stressing	The thermal gradient and temperature increase in SnAg3.5 solder joints under electrical-current stressing have been investigated by thermal infrared microscopy. Both positive and negative thermal gradients were observed under different stressing conditions. The magnitude of the thermal gradient increases with the applied current. The measured thermal gradients reached 365°C/cm as powered by 0.59 A, yet no obvious thermal gradient was observed when the joints were powered less than 0.25 A. The temperature increase caused by joule heating was as high as 54.5°C when powered by 0.59 A, yet only 3.7°C when stressed by 0.19 A. The location of heat generation and path of heat dissipation are believed to play crucial roles in the thermal gradient. When the major heat source is the Al trace, the thermal gradient in the solder bumps is positive; but it may become negative because the heat generated in the solder itself is more prominent.
