15944410020	Comparative study of the physiological properties of collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate as cosmetic materials	The cell biological properties of collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate (<15 000 Da) were studied using murine keratinocytes. Keratinocyte culture experiments demonstrated that only collagen had significant effects on cell attachment and proliferation, but the results of cells cultured on gelatin and collagen hydrolysate showed the rates of adhesion and proliferation were similar to those of cells cultured on plastic as a control. It is concluded that collagen has better physiological effects than those of gelatin and collagen hydrolysate as skin-care cosmetic materials. © 2005 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and the Société Française de Cosmétologie.

The 3-D finite element method was used to calculated the stress-strain of Gongboxia CFRD. By contrasting the results from taking into account the rheological effects with that from without taking account of rheological effects of rockfills, the influence of rheological behaviors of rockfills on deformations in dam, on stress and deformation of face slab and on the deformation of the peripheral joint were analyzed and studied.

23044487591	Differences in properties of collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate	There are many differences in structures and properties among collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate because of different preparation processes. The molecular weight and distribution of samples were determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyaerylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The results showed that the molecular weight of collagen is about 300,000 daltons and narrow distribution, which is greater than those of gelatin (from several thousands to 100,000 Daltons and wide distribution) and collagen hydrolysate (from several thousands to 30,000 Daltons and wide distribution).

23444443688	Numerical analysis of joint types between toe slab and foundation of CFRD in alluvial deposit layer	Two types of joints, the rigid joint and the flexible joint, between toe slab and foundation of the concrete-faced rockfill dam (CFRD) of the Nalan Hydropower Power Station are analyzed by 3D elastoplastic finite element method. Numerical results show that the joint types make small difference to stress-strain behavior of dam, dam foundation and face slab, and they have no obvious influence on stress behavior of toe slab and diaphragm wall, but obvious influence on deformation behavior of toe slab and diaphragm wall. The deformations of toe slab and diaphragm wall in the rigid joint are smaller than the flexible joint. The results of the rigid joint show that deformations of facing joint are quite big, even exceed the deformation capacity of common sealing structure. The flexible joint is recommended based on this numerical analysis.

2442481703	Physiological and cell biological properties in vitro of collagen isolated from calf limed splits	Experiments on self-assembly, susceptibility to collagenase degradation and activity for cell adhesion were carried out to determine the differences between collagen isolated from calf limed splits with acetic acid, alkali or pepsin treatment and commercial type I collagen produced from fresh bovine skins with acetic acid. Self-assembly was observed in all collagen solutions; however, fibril formation of acetic acid-treated collagen and pepsin-treated collagen was observed at neutral pH, as was that of commercial type I collagen whereas, alkali-treated collagen lost its ability of assembly at neutral pH but was able to form fibrils under acidic conditions. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the assembled fibrils from acetic acid-treated collagen had a major fibrous and minor membranous structure similar to that of commercial type I collagen but that reconstructed fibrils from pepsin-treated collagen were more rectilinear and evenly dispersed than were those of other collagens. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) cleaved collagen isolated from limed splits at a similar locus to that of commercial type I collagen. Keratinocytes cultured on collagen showed increased rates of attachment and proliferation. Moreover, pepsin-treated collagen had more significant effects on cell attachment and proliferation than commercial acetic acid-extracted type I collagen.

33644597445	Physicochemical properties of collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate derived from bovine limed split wastes	Collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate were prepared from bovine limed split wastes by different preparative processes. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed that the molecular weight distribution of collagen was very narrow (about 200 and 100kDa for β and α chains respectively) compared with those of gelatin (less than 300kDa and wide distribution) and collagen hydrolysate (less than 50kDa and wide distribution). The isoelectric points of collagen, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate were 8.26, 4.88 and 4.54 respectively determined by Zeta potential titration. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that there were two peaks, a positive peak around 221nm and a negative peak around 192nm for collagen, which are the characteristics of collagen triple helix. However, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate lacked any positive peaks around 220nm, suggesting random coils. The denaturation temperature of collagen was about 37.5°C determined by the viscosity method, the helix-coil transitions for gelatin and collagen hydrolysate were not present in the heating process. Collagen reaggregated to fibrils at 35°C monitored at 313nm. In contrast, gelatin and collagen hydrolysate lost the ability of fibril formation. Collagen was more resistant to trypsin hydrolysis compared with gelatin and collagen hydrolysate. In addition, the collagen membrane exhibited superior features such as higher enthalpy, greater network structure and better physical/mechanical properties compared with those of the gelatin membrane. Therefore, collagen isolated from limed split wastes can be a high value product due to its special characteristics and has many potential future applications in biomaterials, functional additives, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries.

33845722782	Vertical distribution and genesis of the secondary pore in deep formation of Paleogene at Dongpu Sag	Through the analyses of various data, including thin section analysis, SEM, carbonate content, reflectance of vitrinite, clay, reservoir property and others, it is found that the corrosion of the acidic compositions of feldspar, carbonate, sulfate, etc. , is the key factor for the generation of reservoir secondary pores. With burial depth, the corrosion degree of carbonate decreases and that of feldspar increases. The main types of the secondary pores are intergranular pores, intragranular dissolved pores, cement dissolved pores, moulding pores, and fractures. Vertically, there are four secondary pore systems distributed in the formations from 2375 m to 2675 m, from 2975 m to 3350 m, from 3675m to 4200 m, and below 4500m. The mechanisms of genesis include: thermal evolution of organic matter, experiments indicate that the thermal degradation makes kerogen produce a large amount of organic acid before it goes into the oil-generation windows; abnormally high fluid pressure, the fluid thermal cycle convection and curtain-draining hydrocarbon will enlarge oil-generation windows and lead to the forming of secondary pores; eluviations at unconformities or fracture zones produce weathered crust secondary pores.

Electrophoretic patterns showed that the collagen contained α1 and α2 chains, similar to those of calf skin collagen. The imino acid content of the collagen from grass carp skin was much lower than those of mammalian's collagens, as also were the transition temperature and denaturation temperature which were only 24.6 °C and 28.4 °C respectively. Peptide maps of the collagen digested by trypsin and V8 protease showed different peptide fragments from those of calf skin collagen and other fish skin collagens, suggesting differences in amino acid sequences and collagen conformation. In addition, the lyophilized collagen sponge from grass carp skin had a uniform and regular network structure, just like calf skin collagen sponge. These results suggest that grass carp skin has potential for use as a supplementary source of collagen. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because the traditional constitutive model for rockfill material can not reasonably reflect the effect of grain crushing, the calculated deformation of dam body is much different from the measured one. Based on the concept of binary medium model proposed by Professor Shen Zhujiang, a constitutive model of rockfill material considering grain crushing which was conceptualized as binary medium model consisting of structural system and breaking bond was presented, and the relationship between grain crushing rate and breaking parameter was established. An example of large scale triaxial test was taken to prove the rationality of the present model.

It was found that even with 80% of PVA, the COL/PVA blends behaved more like collagen dispersion than pure PVA solution in the dynamic thermal and frequency processing, for instance, a dominant elastic appearance (G′>G″), a similar shear thinning behavior and the thermal denaturation below 40°C. However, influence on the blend behaviour by PVA was noticeable, for instance, an increase of dynamic denaturation temperature, the decreasing intensity of amide I, II and III bands as well as the diminishing irregular pores on the surface of blends. The interaction between collagen and PVA could be observed, especially at the regions with low content or high content of PVA. © 2007 by The Korean Society of Rheology.

Thermal treatment of fish scales indicates that the fibrillary plate is partially calcified. SEM shows two kinds of scale denticles, arranged along the circuli in the anterior field and the lateral fields, respectively. TEM indicates the stratum laxum with abundant fibrils, chromatophores and capillary blood vessels within the scale covering, and shows the fibrillary plate as an 'orthogonal plywood structure' of stratified lamellae, consisting of 80-100 nm diameter collagen fibres co-aligned in individual lamellae and alternated by c. 90° of the fibre alignment between adjacent lamellae. EDAX, FTIR and XRD show that the mineral phase of the scales is a carbonated hydroxyapatite with a Ca:P molar ratio of 1.85. © 2008 The Authors.

The results of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), amino acid composition, and secondary structure showed that the major collagen was typical type I collagen; in contrast, the minor collagen might be classified as type V collagen from the SDS-PAGE patterns and precipitation properties by NaCl. A sharp decrease in solubility of type I collagen was observed at the NaCl concentration of 40 g/L. The maximum and the minimum solubilities of collagen were observed at pH 3 and 8, respectively. Peptide maps of type I collagen digested by trypsin and V8 protease were different from those of calfskin and fish skin collagens. The imino acid content of type I collagen was lower than those of mammalian collagens and so did its denaturation temperature that was 30.3C obtained by viscosity measurement. © 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

80052299542	Interactions of collagen molecules in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide activated adipic acid (NHS-AA) as a crosslinking agent	The effect of crosslinking agent on pepsin-soluble bovine collagen solution was examined using N-hydroxysuccinimide activated adipic acid (NHS-AA) as a crosslinker. Electrophoretic patterns indicated that crosslinks formed when NHS-AA was added. A higher polarity level deduced from the changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum of pyrene in the crosslinked collagen solution indicated that the formation of well-ordered aggregates was suppressed. The random aggregation of collagens was also observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, the association of collagens into fibrils was influenced by crosslinking. Self-assembly was suppressed at 37 °C; however, as temperature was increased to 39 °C, a small amount of NHS-AA leaded to an improvement in the ability of self-aggregation. Although more random structure was brought about by crosslinking, self-aggregation might still be promoted as temperature was increased, accompanying by the thermal stability improvement of fibrils. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Major improvements in the tests are made in terms of similar materials of fluid-solid and advanced measurement methods/techniques. By using the new similar materials of fluid-solid, true reappearance of catastrophe evolution process for the water inrush induced by mining disturbance is obtained, and multivariate precursor information for real time water inrush is collected by means of the fiber bragg grating technology, acoustic emission technique and resistivity tomography technology. A numerical method considering the coupling effect of multi-physics field is adopted in order to know the coupling evolution law of stress field, displacement field and seepage field in the catastrophe evolution process of water inrush and the response characteristics of precursor information for multi-physics field of water inrush are analyzed. Based on the results of model test and numerical simulation, rock stress suddenly decreases after sustainable growth when the water-resistant key strata rupture, and rock displacement suddenly jumps after sustainable growth, but there exits a stable surging segment in which precursor information of water inrush is contained before jumping appears, and rock seepage suddenly decreases after continuous decrease, but there exits an abnormal fluctuating segment in which precursor information of water inrush is contained long before water inrush happens, and rock apparent resistivity and acoustic emission energy also suddenly increase before water inrush happens. Based on the analysis of evolution law of multi-field information and its effectiveness for water inrush prediction, changing information of seepage, apparent resistivity and displacement for water-resistant key strata is an important precursory information source for disaster warning. The conclusions will help the further understanding of water inrush mechanism, and the test results will provide certain guiding principles for studies of real-time monitoring theory.

The enthalpy changes (ΔH) for collagen varied with collagen concentrations, indicating that the aggregation state of collagen molecules was correlated with its thermal effect. Fluorescence measurements of pyrene in collagen solutions, which showed the polarity of the microenvironment in collagen molecules, suggested different behaviors: aggregation (20-32 °C) and disaggregation (38-50 °C), which was manifested by the changes in morphology of collagen fibers as observed by AFM. Furthermore, emission intrinsic fluorescence spectra of collagen at different temperatures showed that the fluorescence intensity of collagen decreased with increasing temperature, and the dynamic response of collagen molecules to temperature was further explored from the corresponding two-dimensional correlation fluorescence spectra.

The objective of this work was to perform pilot plant trials to extract high-value native collagen from these wastes through improved pretreatment methods. Results: EDTA- and HCl-pretreatment gave similar removal percentages of inorganic substances. Owing to the open structure of fibers, the collagen yield of HCl-pretreated splits (HPS) (41.31%) was higher than that of EDTA-pretreated splits (EPS) (10.42%). Furthermore, HCl-pretreated split collagen (HPC) had a more acidic isoelectric point, lower content of primary amino groups, larger Z-average particle size and higher relative viscosity than EDTA-pretreated split collagen (EPC). Electrophoretic analysis and circular dichroism spectra revealed the maintenance of polypeptide and triple helix conformation, respectively. In addition, the transition temperatures of EPC (34.7 °C) and HPC (34.6 °C) detected by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were close to that of commercial collagen from calfskin (CCC) (35.7 °C). Conclusion: A process of native collagen extraction from limed bovine split wastes was proposed. While both EPC and HPC represented similar physicochemical properties to those of CCC, the collagen yield of HPS was much higher than that of EPS. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

48549100029	Numerical calculation of CFRD based on binary medium model of rockfill	For high concrete faced rockfill dam, the grain crushing is so large in high stress field which may increase the deformation rate of dam body that it should be considered in numerical calculation. Because the traditional constitutive model for rockfill material can not reasonably reflect the effects of grain crushing, the calculation deformation of dam body is much different from its measured deformation. Tianshengqiao CFRD (concrete faced rockfill dam) is the first 200 m class high dam which has abound observation date in the similar of type built dam in China. Based on binary medium model considering grain crushing of rockfill material, the stress-strain behavior of dam body is analyzed by planar finite element method (FEM). Because the dilatancy quantity of dam materials will decrease and their corresponding shrinkage quantity will increase when the grain crushing is considered in numerical calculation, the calculation results of the suggested model is more accurate in qualitative analysis and more reasonable in quantitative analysis. It could be better to be used simulate stress-strain behavior of CFRD, especially high CFRD.

57649088344	Deterioration of rockfill and its effect on safe operation of dams	owadays, soft rocks easy to weather have been widely used in the construction of earth-rock dams. The change of water content and temperature may lead to the deterioration of mechanical characters of rockfill during the dam's long-term operation. Further more, acid rain may affect the mechanical characters of rockfill more and more strongly with the deterioration of air and environment pollution around the world. Usually, the life-span of rockfill is much longer than the service-span of dams, but sometimes the mechanical characters of rockfill may change greatly in short time even in several months. The deterioration may lead to the decrease of strength of rockfill and the stability of dams, and it may cause additional deformation of dams. At present, only the weathering status of rocks is considered in the dam design. The rocks are merely divided into wholly-weathered, strongly-weathered, slightly-weathered and so on. The effect of weathering on the life-span and the function of rockfill after construction is seldom considered. With the progress made in environmental geotechnical engineering, the transformation from qualitative description to quantitative research may come true in the researches on weathering. A new constitutive model takeing rock weathering into account based on the single line method or double line method is put forward. It could be applied in the quantitative analysis of the change of the stress-deformation characters of dams during their life-span. The principles of utilizing soft rockfill are also discussed.

In this study, the pigskin shavings, generated from the shaving of pelts which had been dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate after deliming, were pretreated to remove most of salt and fat. Then alkaline treatment method was used to extract collagen from the pigskin shavings. Sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and circular dichroism (CD) spectra revealed that the alkali-soluble pigskin collagen (ASPC) retained the polypeptide chains and triple helix conformation. The amino acid profiles showed no major deviation from the characteristic collagen composition. Both of the denaturation temperature and the isoelectric point (pi) of ASPC were lower than those of pepsin- solubilized pigskin collagen (PSPC). Scanning electron microscopy showed that ASPC sponges had porous fibrillar network structures, and the pore sizes became larger with the decrease of collagen concentrations and as the pH of the collagen solution approached the pi of ASPC.

77955439523	A new elliptic-parabolic yield surface model revised by an adaptive criterion for granular soils	An adaptive criterion for shear yielding as well as shear failure of soils is proposed in this paper to address the fact that most criteria, including the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, the Lade criterion and the Matsuoka-Nakai criterion, cannot agree well with the experimental results when the value of the intermediate principal stress parameter is too big. The new criterion can adjust an adaptive parameter based on the experimental results in order to make the theoretical calculations fit the test results more accurately. The original elliptic-parabolic yield surface model can capture both soil contraction and dilation behaviors. However, it normally over-predicts the soil strength due to its application of the Extended Mises criterion. A new elliptic-parabolic yield surface mode is presented in this paper, which introduces the adaptive criterion in three-dimensional principal stress space. The new model can well model the stress-strain behavior of soils under general stress conditions. Compared to the original model which can only simulate soil behavior under triaxial compression conditions, the new model can simulate soil behaviors under both triaxial compression conditions and general stress conditions. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The dam deformation, especially the post dam deformation, is the key factor to determine the stress behavior of the concrete face. For super-high CFRD, large post dam deformation easily causes damage of concrete face and vertical joints. Compression vertical joints adopting flexible joints with enough width can absorb the axial deformation and reduce the axial pressure of the concrete face. The deformation control and suitable joint plan are the key to improve the stress behavior of the concrete face and are also the key to avoid or reduce the rupture of the concrete face.

The activation energy of the denaturation process was examined utilizing the differential (Friedman) and the integral (Ozawa-Flynn-Wall) isoconversional methods, and several kinetic models were evaluated using the method of multivariate non-linear regression. Besides, the denaturation behavior was simulated under different temperature conditions. Results showed that the activation energy decreased in a different way at lower and higher degrees of conversion, respectively. A three-state model, in which a reversible step was followed by an irreversible one, was the best of the estimated models to describe the denaturation process, which could be approximated by single-step or two-consecutive-step in terms of temperature conditions.© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Fish skin collagen solution (FSCS) exhibited a shear-thinning flow behavior. The complex viscosity (η*), loss tangent (tan δ) and relaxation time of 1.5% FSCS decreased with the increase of temperature. Also, tan δ decreased while the relaxation time increased with the increase of FSCS concentration. FSCS had considerably lower storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), η* values and relaxation time and a higher tan δ value than those of bovine skin collagen solution (BSCS). However, FSCS behaved without regularity above 27.5°C, which was in agreement with the result that the dynamic denaturation temperature of this collagen was approximately 29.5°C.

The results show that: (1) when waste water is treated only by ultrasound for 60 seconds, the removal rate of COD is 40.6%; (2) when total concentration of coagulants is increased to 100 mg/l, the greatest reduction of COD is achieved; (3) when wastewater is first treated with ultrasound for 60 seconds and then flocculated by coagulants, the reduction of COD is 10 - 37% higher than the controls without ultrasound. Thus, treatment of tannery wastewater with flocculating-settling technology can be effectively improved by ultrasound.

79960861791	The effect of cross-linking on the dynamic viscoelastic properties and thermal stability of collagen solution	To improve the viscoelastic properties, thermal stability and enzymatic resistance of collagen, collagen solution was cross-linked with a novel cross-linker, N-hydroxysuccinimide activated adipic acid (NHS-AA), and the effect of NHS-AA on the physicochemical properties of collagen was investigated. The rheological and thermal properties of cross-linked collagen solutions have been investigated by means of dynamic frequency sweeps and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). At 25°C, when the concentration of NHS-AA was increased from 0 to 0.03%, the storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), complex viscosity (η*) of collagen solution increased from 0.03, 0.11 Pa, 0.76 Pa·s to 22.83, 3.36 Pa, 143.90 Pa·s, respectively.

81055144258	Critical state of rockfill materials and a constitutive model considering grain crushing	The grain crushing of rockfill materials with high stress level has significant influence on its strength and deformation mechanisms. The soil mechanics theory based on critical state concept can describe the stress-strain relationship of reconstituted soils successfully, but currently for rockfill materials, few studies are conducted on influence of grain crushing on critical state and its mathematical description. The consolidation drained and undrained triaxial compression tests of 18 sets with consolidation stress ranging from 0.4 MPa to 4 MPa and isotropic compression tests of 6 sets were conducted on rockfill materials. The experimental results show that: for all the consolidation confining pressures, the samples tended to critical state under drained and undrained conditions; and the critical states of rockfill materials in q-p' plane and e-lgp' plane all behave nonlinear. Based on these experimental results and by introducing state parameter, a new constitutive model for rockfill materials is formulated under the framework of generalized plasticity; and the determination of model parameters is provided as well. Finally, the constitutive model is used to simulate the test results of rockfill materials from Changhe Dam; and it is verified that the proposed constitutive model could simulate well the stress-strain features of rockfill materials with the consolidated confining pressures ranging from 0.4 MPa to 3.5 MPa.

Based on the theory of generalized plasticity, and by introducing state parameter, a new dynamic constitutive model for rockfill materials was formulated in complex stress paths, and the model parameters was determined. Finally, the constitutive model was used to model the test results of rockfill materials under both monotonic loading at 400, 1200, 2000 and 3500 kPa confining pressures and axially cyclic loading at 800 kPa and 2200 kPa confining pressures. The result showed that the proposed constitutive model could simulate well the effects of grain crushing on dynamic responses of rockfill materials.

84861098046	Interaction study in homogeneous collagen/chondroitin sulfate blends by two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy	The neutral homogeneous collagen/chondroitin sulfate (Col/CS) blends were prepared when using 0.25 mol/L NaCl to stabilize the blends. Composition-dependent Fourier transform-infrared (FTIR) spectra were analyzed by generalized two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy to investigate the conformational changes of collagen and the specific interactions between collagen and CS. When adding CS to the collagen solution, C-H bending vibration of collagen varies firstly, then collagen skeleton, and finally the specific interactions between collagen and CS. The Col/CS ratios influence the kinds of specific interactions. Only hydroxyl groups of CS interact with CO group of collagen owing to the charge shielding effect of NaCl when the CS content is less than 50 wt%. Besides hydrogen bond, the electrostatic interactions between ionized carboxyl group or sulfate group of CS and ε-amino group of lysine or guanidine group of arginine appear when the CS content is more than 50 wt%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863589300	Investigation on critical state of rockfill materials	The grain crushing of rockfill materials with high stress level has significant influence on its strength and deformation mechanisms. The soil mechanics theory based on critical state concept can describe the stress-strain relationship of reconstituted soil materials successfully, but currently for rockfill, few studies are conducted on influence of grain crushing on critical states and mathematical description of critical state line. The consolidation drained and undrained triaxial compression tests of 18 sets with consolidation stress ranging from 400 kPa to 4 MPa and isotropic compression tests of 6 sets were conducted on rockfill materials. The results demonstrated experimentally that: (1) when the consolidation confining pressure was low, soil particles crushed slightly, the samples dilated under drained conditions and the pore pressure increased firstly then reduced slightly; when the consolidation confining pressure was high, soil particles crushed heavily, the samples contracted under drained conditions and the pore pressure increased also firstly then reduced slightly; for the isotropic compression tests, with the increase of mean effective stress the soil particles broke up gradually but very small; (2) for all the consolidation confining pressures, the samples tended to critical state under drained and undrained conditions; (3) the critical state of rockfill in q-p′ and e-lgp′ plane behaved nonlinear. Finally a formula describing the critical state of rockfill was proposed and verified well with test data.

Dynamic rheological measurement indicated that the storage modulus, loss modulus, complex viscosity and dynamic denaturation temperature increased while the loss tangent decreased with increasing the degree of cross-linking (DC). In addition, collagens with different DC exhibited a significant difference in their activation energies. It was found that collagens with DC in three intervals (DC < ∼25%, ∼25% < DC < ∼50% and DC > ∼50%, respectively) possessed remarkably different rheological behaviors each other. That is, collagens with DC < ∼25% exhibited a liquid-like behavior, while collagens with DC > ∼25% tended to exhibit a solid-like behavior, and especially a sudden loss of flow was observed for collagen with DC > ∼50%. Similar trends were observed from the features in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of collagen. That is, denaturation temperature (T

Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the denaturation temperature of pepsin-treated collagen was very similar to that of commercial type I collagen but much higher than those of acetic acid-treated collagen and alkali-treated collagen. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting revealed that the subunit composition in collagen solution samples appeared to be major type I collagen and minor type III collagen. Scanning electron microscopy showed that acetic acid-treated collagen had a porous fibrillar network structure, while pepsin-treated collagen and alkali-treated collagen had membranous networks resembling that of commercial type I collagen.

84869414526	Effect of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose on collagen fibril formation in vitro	Collagen and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were mixed to obtain blends and the effect of HPMC on collagen self-assembly was studied. As deduced from atomic force microscopy (AFM), the amount of nuclei in collagen-HPMC solutions was changed with the addition of HPMC. Under physiological conditions, the kinetics curves of fibril formation showed that the turbidity of blends at 313. nm was higher than that of native collagen. More HPMC was involved in the hydrogel network for blends with higher HPMC/collagen. However, both the thermal stability and the storage moduli of hydrogels, which was evaluated by UV and rheological measurements respectively, reached the maximum just when HPMC/collagen = 0.25. Furthermore, it was showed by AFM that denser fibrils with smaller diameter would be obtained as HPMC/collagen < 0.25, while more addition of HPMC (HPMC/collagen > 0.25) would bring about fibrils with larger diameter. However, HPMC did not significantly affect the characteristic D-periods of the fibrils for all blends. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84869812841	Constitutive model for coarse granular materials based on breakage energy	The existing constitutive models incorporating particle breakage mainly introduce the particle breakage index to reflect the influences of the particle breakage on the mechanical properties of coarse granular materials. Because of the external display of the particle breakage index of coarse particles under external load, the measured parameters actually include the influences of the particle breakage, and the methods for the particle breakage into which by introducing the particle breakage index are not suitable. Based on the Ueng's and Chen's dilatancy formulae, the dilatancy equation considering the particle breakage and the relevant methods for its parameters are proposed by analyzing the energy equilibrium problems in the process of triaxial CD tests. The Rowe's dilatancy formula and the proposed dilatancy equation considering the particle breakage are respectively introduced into the Duncan-Chang E-ν model and the NHRI double-yield face model by Shen Zhujiang. Through the comparison with the results of triaxial CD tests and the finite element numerical analysis of a case study, it is shown that the proposed model can satisfactorily reflect the dilatancy properties of the materials, for example, the elastoplastic model may depict the increase of the deformation and simultaneously the decrease of the strength of the materials during the particle breakage. The rationality and reliability of the proposed model are thus validated. Compared with the existing constitutive models considering the particle breakage, the proposed model has the advantages of small test workload, few parameters and clear significance of parameters, etc., and it is convenient to be popularized in projects.

84870360362	The aggregation behavior of native collagen in dilute solution studied by intrinsic fluorescence and external probing	The aggregation behavior of type I collagen in acid solutions with the concentrations covering a range of 0.06-1.50 mg/mL was studied utilizing both of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the phenylalanine and tyrosine residues and the external probing of 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS). FRET at 0.30 mg/mL showed the distance among collagen monomers was within 10 nm without the obvious aggregates formed. The predominance of tyrosine fluorescence in FRET in the range of 0.45-0.75 mg/mL identified the existence of collagen aggregates companied with the formation of hydrophobic microdomains revealed by the change of the fluorescence of ANS. The blue-shift of tyrosine fluorescence from 303 to 293 nm for 0.90-1.50 mg/mL dedicated the formation of high order aggregates. The results from the two-phase diagrams of the intrinsic fluorescence for the guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding of collagen confirmed these conclusions. By the two-dimensional correlation analysis for the intrinsic fluorescence of collagen solutions of 0.45, 0.75 and 1.05 mg/mL, the probable characteristic fluorescence peaks for the interactions of proline-aromatic (CH ∼ π) among the collagen molecules were found at 298 and 316 nm. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed 2-propanol changed the viscosity of blends with the low shear rate, while, the viscosity of blends was insusceptible to the 2-propanol with the high shear rate. The Power low model and the Carreau model were used to fit the steady flow of the blends, and the parameters obtained from models, such as viscosity coefficient K and non-Newton index n, described the rheological behaviors of blends well. The values of the yield stress of blends decreased with adding 2-propanol, suggesting that 2-propanol improved the flow of the collagen solution and the stability of blends decreased. In addition, the thixotropic area of the blend with 1mol/L 2-propanol was smaller than that of the pure collagen solution, indicating that entangled chain could reverse soon. However, the thixotropic area of the blends with 2 and 3mol/L 2-propanol was larger than that of the pure collagen solution, suggesting that reversion ability of the blends decreased and it was not good for the stability of the blends.

84873189417	The influence of chondroitin 4-sulfate on the reconstitution of collagen fibrils in vitro	Collagen fibrils were in vitro reconstituted from the aggregated collagen solution in the presence of a wide range of collagen/chondroitin 4-sulfate (Col/C4S) ratios. As revealed by turbidimetric measurement, the collagen fibril formation is significantly accelerated by C4S. The turbidity values of both the solution after 30. min preincubation at 4 °C and the gels after 60. min preincubation at 37 °C become larger with the increase of C4S amount. According to the results obtained from turbidimetric measurement and atomic force microscopy observation of solutions, it is predicted that the preincubation of Col/C4S blends at 4 °C is necessary to initiate the Col/C4S binding and then promote the further lateral fusion of collagen aggregates in solution. The interactions between collagen and C4S are also vital in the growth phase of collagen self-assembly. Collagen quantitation data show that the amounts of collagen incorporated into self-assembled cofibrils increase a lot as a result of the presence of C4S. Differential scanning calorimetry measurement shows that the thermal stability of cofibrils keeps increasing with the ascending amount of incorporated C4S. It is suggested that the bound C4S might be captured inside the cofibrils acting as promoter and stabilizer. Atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy observations of self-assembled fibrils indicate that the size increase of the self-assembled cofibrils depends on the lateral accretion of small collagen fibrils, while the self-assembly mode of collagen is not affected. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874538413	Safety criteria and limit resistance capacity of high earth-rock dams subjected to earthquakes	By investigating and analyzing the earthquake damage performance and the in-situ observations of earth-rock dams, a series of criteria to control the safety of high earth-rock dams subjected to earthquakes are proposed in terms of three main influencing factors including slope stability, permanent deformation of the dam and deformation of peripheral joints. These criteria are used to study the limit earthquake-resistant capacity of a typical earth-core rockfill dam and a concrete faced rockfill dam, respectively. It is found that high earth-rock dams can resist strong earthquakes. The limit earthquake-resistant capacity of the two cases is as high as 0.5 g, which means that the two dams can perform well without catastrophic subsequences even attacked by an earthquake with degree of nine. Furthermore, the limit earthquake-resistant capacity of high earth-rock dams largely depends on the safety criteria. The most important factor to control the safety of an earth-core rockfill dam under earthquakes is the slope stability while the deformation of the peripheral joint is the control factor for the safety of concrete faced rockfill dams.

The equilibrium surface tension and the isoelectric point were 55.92. mN/m and 4.93 respectively, suggesting that acylated collagen had surface activity as well as water solubility. Meanwhile, the results of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses and electrophoresis patterns demonstrated that the triple helix conformation of collagen was not destroyed, but the subunits of acylated collagen shifted to higher molecular weight than those of native collagen. Scanning electron microscope and differential scanning calorimeter measurements revealed that lyophilized acylated collagen exhibited relatively well-distributed pore structure and its denaturation temperature was about 9.0 °C higher than that of native collagen. Additionally, the increase of the diameter of the fibrils was observed by atomic force microscopy. Acylated collagen with water solubility and better surface activity might broaden the application of collagen-based materials to cosmetics, drug delivery and pharmacotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, NaCl screened the electrostatic attraction between electropositive collagen molecules and electronegative hyaluronic acid molecules. It was great to avoid forming polyionic complexes and strengthen the compatibility of blend system so that collagen and hyaluronic acid were compatible in any mass ratio. According to fourier transform infrared spectrum data, principal component analysis indicated that, in pure water, new hydrogen bonds formed between amide I, II and III of collagen and C-O-C, CO, N-H, C-OH of hyaluronic acid when they were compatible. After NaCl was added, new hydrogen bonds only formed between amide I and II of collagen and CO, N-H, C-OH of hyaluronic acid.

The results showed the rheological properties of the collagen solutions with different NaCl concentrations were quite different. With low NaCl concentrations (0 to 0.1 mol/L), the collagen solutions exhibited salting in effect. The pseudoplastic behavior of the solutions became weak, while the thixotropy became strong. The collagen solutions with high NaCl concentrations (0.1 to 0.3 mol/L) exhibited salting out effect. The pseudoplastic behavior of the solutions became strong and the thixotropy had no obvious variation. In addition, Ostwald de-waele model, Carreau model and Herschel-Bulkley model were used to fit the experimental data.

Partial important physicochemical properties such as the molecular weight, the morphologies, the interaction between molecules, and especially the thermal stability of the cross-linked collagens were examined by various methods. Results from sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated the formation of cross-links, and thus the molecular weight of collagen was increased. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) suggested that the fiber diameter of cross-linked collagens was larger than that of collagen control. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the number of pores from collagen sponges was reduced, accompanied by the rise in their pore sizes. According to Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra, the value of amide III/amide I increased as a small amount of NHS-AA was used. Then it decreased and remained at a relatively constant level as NHS-AA was further added, which might indicate the altered interaction between collagen molecules due to cross-linking. Most important is the improved thermal stability of the cross-linked collagens as determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The reason for this improvement was further exposed by two-dimensional (2D) FTIR with temperature as perturbation. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84892589928	Rheological properties of collagen/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (COL/HPMC) blended solutions	Collagen/HPMC blends with different HPMC content (HC) were investigated by dynamic responses, creep recovery, thixotropy, and morphological observation. Storage modulus, loss modulus, complex viscosity, and activation energy decreased with the increased HC, while the flow behavior index increased with the increased HC and the dynamic denaturation temperature reached the maximum as HC increased to 50%, indicating that the flowability and thermal stability of collagen solution were improved by the addition of HPMC. However, the blends with higher HC tended to have a relatively lower recovery capacity, and the hysteresis loop areas of the blends were lower than that of collagen (especially when HC > 50%). Additionally, the morphology of collagen/HPMC was examined by both of atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. By combining with these results, it seemed that the rheological and structural properties of collagen/HPMC were related to the hydrogen-bond interaction and compatibility between collagen and HPMC molecules. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84894520068	Creep deformation of 300 m-high earth core rockfill dam	For 300 m-high earth core rockfill dams, the creep characteristics of dam body have the vital significance in prediction of long-term deformation and settlement after dam construction. Meanwhile they are also very important to be used to evaluate whether or not the impervious core wall can match the long-term deformation of dams and keep on normal operation. Based on Shuangjiangkou Dam (314 m high, earth core rockfill dam), rockfill materials are tested by using a large high-pressure triaxial apparatus to study the creep characteristics. The results show that under multi-stage loading and single-stage loading, the difference of creep curves from the two tests decreases with the development of time when the tests have the same final stress state. And finally, the creep curves tend to converge. Using the empirical model for creep, the relevant parameters are obtained from the test data. The creep characteristics of 300 m-high earth core rockfill dam are analyzed by using the 3D finite element method. The numerical analysis shows that the creep velocity has a distinct influence on the settlement after dam construction. Compared with that of the actual creep conditions in dam body, the creep velocity in tests is much faster, so it's necessary to make inverse analysis according to the built dams, which can provide an available method to amend the creep velocity.

84899756318	Stress-deformation properties of super-high CFRDs under complex terrain conditions	Valley terrain is one of the most important factors which affect the stress and deformation of CFRDs. Different valley terrains lead to different boundary conditions of CFRDs and further influence the state of stress and deformation. 3D-FEM is employed to analyze the stress and deformation of a super-high CFRD 256 m in height under complex topography. It is indicated that the asymmetric and irregular river valley has large influence on the stress and deformation coordination of CFRD, especially the change of stress and deformation gradient is larger near the ancient river terraces at the right bank, which is harmful to the safety of the concrete slab, and thus it is necessary to take measures during design and construction. By comparing the results of two adjustment schemes, the influence of the ancient riverbed on the right bank is analyzed. At the same time, the steep slope at the left bank causes the tensile stress of panel and large displacement of peripheral joints. Based on the results of three adjustment schemes, the influence degree of the steep bank slope is analyzed.

Compared with native collagen, acylated collagen exhibited better surface activity such as oil absorption capacity, emulsion activity and stability, foam expansion, and foam stability but presented lower water absorption capacity. Acylated collagen also had higher emulsion activity and stability than Tween 80, whereas Tween 80 displayed higher foam expansion and stability than acylated collagen. After acylation, the surface tension of collagen decreased with the storage time increased, the hydrophobicity and the wetting power increased with the increase of the concentration. Meanwhile, the emulsion activity and stability of acylated collagen decreased with the increase of NaCl concentration ranging from 20 to 100 mmol/L. Under neutral pH value, acylated collagen reached higher emulsion activity and stability at acylated collagen concentration of 0.4 mg/mL and lower temperature (<35°C). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Based on the results of the determination of residual amino group content, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dynamic rheological measurements, differential scanning calorimetry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), it was proved that the collagen solutions possessed strikingly different physicochemical properties depending on the amount of GTA. At low GTA amounts [GTA/collagen (w/w) ≤ 0.1], the residual amino group contents of the cross-linked collagens decreased largely from 100% to 32.76%, accompanied by an increase in the molecular weight. Additionally, increases of the fiber diameter and the values of G′, G″ and η* were measured, while the thermal denaturation temperature (Td) did not change visibly and the fluidity of collagen samples was still retained with increasing the GTA amount. When the ratio of GTA to collagen exceeded 0.1, although the residual amino group content only decreased by ∼8.2%, the cross-linked collagen solution [GTA/collagen (w/w) = 0.3] displayed a clear loss of flow and a sudden rise (∼2.0 °C) of the Td value compared to the uncross-linked collagen solution, probably illustrating that the collagen solution was converted into a gel with mature network structure-containing nuclei observed in AFM image. It was conjectured that the physicochemical properties of the collagen solutions might be in connection with the cross-linking between collagen molecules from the same aggregate or different aggregates. © 2014 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

The results showed that the solutions cross-linked by different doses of NHS-AA were all pseudoplastic. The viscosity of collagen solutions increased with the increase of the dose of NHS-AA. The elastic modulus of collagen solutions increased dramatically due to the addition of NHS-AA and that indicated that NHS-AA reinforced the elasticity of collagen solution. The thixotropy of collagen solution became strong after adding NHS-AA, suggesting that the recovery of network structure broken by shear stress became slow. Adding NHS-AA resulted in the decrease of the compliance of collagen solution, reflecting that the cross-linked collagen solution was more difficult to transform with shear stress. All the experiments results indicated that the rheological properties of collagen solution could be adjusted by NHS-AA.

The objective of this work was to report an application of the hairs, i.e., preparing the filling agent for retanning, and the environmental and economic aspects of the utilization were discussed. After the recovery of bovine hairs through a hair-save unhairing method, the hairs were subjected to a series of pretreatments and then hydrolyzed to obtain the filling agent for retanning. The retanning experiments showed that the fullness, softness and elasticity, as well as the thickness of the leather retanned with this filling agent were increased, and the retanned leather had fine and tight grain. Furthermore, the filling agent had assistant dyeing properties, and the tensile strength and tearing strength of the retanned leather were improved. Besides, due to the recovery of hairs, the concentration of suspended solids, total nitrogen, sulphide and chemical oxygen demand were reduced in wasted unhairing-liming liquor, resulting in an easier handling of the tannery wastewater. Finally, cost-benefit analyses of both the hair-save unhairing process and the recycling of recovered hairs were detailed.

The grafted copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate onto the hydrolysates was prepared using ammonium persulfate as an inorganic initiator in aqueous medium, and the emulsion was crosslinked sequentially using aluminium salt. The grafting reactions were carried out at 80°C. Effects of the initiator concentration and the ratio of hydrolysates to monomer on the properties of emulsion, such as Zeta potential, particle size, viscosity and stability of the emulsion, were also investigated. FTIR spectra proved the existence of poly(methyl methacrylate-co-butyl acrylate) grafted polypeptide. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the pure methyl methacrylate and butyl acrylate-grafted polypeptide showed the property of water-resistance. After the grafted emulsion was crosslinked, a significant increase in viscosity was observed. The 180° peeling strength of the adhesive increased with the increase of aluminium salt concentration from 0.5%?2.5%(w/w), and then decreased when the concentration of aluminium was 3%(w/w). The peak value of the 180° peeling strength was in the range of 1300-1600N/m for 4 kinds of bio-adhesives.

Meanwhile, when the pH value of CBS solution was close to the isoelectric point of CBS, the net charge of CBS would decrease, which resulted in the lower surface tension. At lower temperature, CBS exhibited good surface activity; while at higher temperature (>35 ℃), the surface tension increased rapidly due to the denaturation.
