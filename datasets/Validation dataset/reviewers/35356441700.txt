15844365122	A non-linear analysis of the bending modulus of carbon nanotubes with rippling deformations	Recently, some experimental techniques involving bending of cantilevered nanotubes have been used to deduce their elastic bending modulus. Using these methods it was found that the value of elastic bending modulus decreases dramatically from about 1 TPa for D less than 10 nm to 100 GPa for D larger than 20 nm. This discovery defines usual belief that the bending modulus is a material's intrinsic property, independent of the size of the nanotubes. This paper concerned with the non-linear moment-curvature relationship during bending of nanotubes, and the effect of ripple formation on the bending modulus. By using an advanced finite element analysis package, ABAQUS, a non-linear bending moment-curvature relationship of carbon nanotubes, which is the appearance of a rippling mode on the inner arc of the bent nanotubes, is simulated from the three-dimensional orthotropic theory of finite elasticity deformation. Utilizing the non-linear bending moment-curvature relationship, and a non-linear vibration analysis method, we capture that the rippling deformation can indeed result in effective bending modulus of carbon nanotubes decrease substantially with increasing diameter. The result carried out may be used to explain some experiment phenomena, and also guides further experiment investigating the bending behaviors of carbon nanotubes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

22944483163	Dynamic focusing effects of piezoelectric fiber-reinforced laminated composites system subjected to thermal shock	This article reveals some phenomena of the dynamic focusing effects of laminated composites with piezoelectric fiber and matrix layer, subjected to thermal shock of a transitory temperature change, by means of an exact analytical solution and the corresponding numerical example. The dynamic focusing effects give rise to much higher tensile stress magnitudes and electric potential at the center or at near the center of the piezoelectric fiber-reinforced composites system, which easily results in breakage along the axial direction of the piezoelectric fiber at the higher tensile stress region. From the analytical expression and numerical example for the piezoelectric fiber reinforced composites system PZT-4/Matrix, it is important to know the mechanism of the dynamic focusing effect of the piezoelectric fiber reinforced composites system and to evaluate the dynamic strength and electric signal of the laminated composites with piezoelectric fiber.

The multiple shell model is adopted and the effect of van der Waals forces between adjacent nanotubes is taken into account. According to the ratio of radius-to-thickness, multi-walled carbon nanotubes discussed here are classified into three cases: thin, thick, and nearly solid. The critical shear stress and the torsional buckling mode are calculated for various radius-to-thickness ratios. Results carried out show that the buckling mode (m, n) corresponding the critical shear stress is sole, which is obviously different from the axially compressed buckling of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

29044445648	Hygrothermal effects on initial frictional pull-out force of CNTs-reinforced composites	Based on the strong bonding between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the polymer matrix, the influence of hygrothermal environments on the initial pull-out force applied on the CNTs in CNTs-reinforced composite systems in investigated by means of thermoelasticity and conventional fiber pull-out models. According to the known literature, the material properties of the composite systems are affected by the variation of temperature and moisture, and the coefficient of thermal expansion of the CNTs is considered as transverse isotropic and is a nonlinear function of the temperature variation. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the polymer matrix is isotropic and is a linear function of the temperature variation. In a fully debonded region, an extended Coulomb's friction law, in which the friction coefficient depends on the pull-out rate, is used to determine the initial frictional pull-out force applied on the CNTs and the interfacial shear stress under various hygrothermal environments. In example calculations, the effects of the temperature variation of CNTs-reinforced composite systems, the moisture concentration variation in the matrix, the pull-out rate imposed on the CNTs end, the chiral vectors and the number of layers of the CNTs on the initial frictional pull-out force applied on the CNTs end in CNTs-reinforced composite systems are described and discussed.

29144510490	Effects of initial stress on transverse wave propagation in carbon nanotubes based on Timoshenko laminated beam models	Based on Timoshenko laminated beam models, this paper investigates the influence of initial stress on the vibration and transverse wave propagation in individual multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) under ultrahigh frequency (above 1 THz), in which the initial stress in the MWNTs can occur due to thermal or lattice mismatch between different materials. Considering van der Waals force interaction between two adjacent tubes and effects of rotary inertia and shear deformation, results show that the initial stress in individual multi-wall carbon nanotubes not only affects the number of transverse wave speeds and the magnitude of transverse wave speeds, but also terahertz critical frequencies at which the number of wave speeds changes. When the initial stress in individual multi-wall carbon nanotubes is the compressive stress, transverse wave speeds decrease and the vibration amplitude ratio of two adjacent tubes increases. When the initial stress in individual multi-wall carbon nanotubes is the tensile stress, transverse wave speeds increase and the vibration amplitude ratio of two adjacent tubes decreases. The investigation of the effects of initial stress on transverse wave propagation in carbon nanotubes may be used as a useful reference for the application and the design of nanoelectronic and nanodrive devices, nano-oscillators, and nanosensors, in which carbon nanotubes act as basic elements.

The effects of the surrounding elastic medium and the van der Waals forces between two adjacent tubes are taken into account. The critical bending moment and the corresponding buckling mode for three types of MWNTs with different layer numbers and ratios of radius to thickness are calculated. Results obtained show that the bending buckling mode corresponding to the critical bending moment is unique, which is obviously different from the purely axial compression buckling of an individual MWNT. On the other hand, a simplified method is applied to calculate the bending stability of MWNTs with larger layers, embedded in an elastic medium, by substitution of a multiple shell with fewer layers. The new features of the bending stability of MWNTs embedded in an elastic medium and some meaningful results in this paper are helpful for the application and the design of nanostructures in which MWNTs act as basic elements. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results obtained show that the influence of initial stress in carbon nanotubes on their natural frequency is obvious, but the influence of initial stress in carbon nanotubes on the intertube resonant frequency of multi-wall carbon nanotubes is not obvious, especially for large aspect ratios. The influence of initial stress in carbon nanotubes on their flexural vibration modes is dependent on the tension or compression forms of the initial stress.

33744541403	Wave propagation in carbon nanotubes under shear deformation	This paper reports the results of an investigation on the effect of shear deformations on wave propagation in carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic matrix. A multi-walled carbon nanotube is considered as a multiple shell coupled together through van der Waals forces between two adjacent tubes. The surrounding matrix is considered as a spring element defined by the Winkler model. Using the variational calculus of Hamilton's principle, dynamic governing equations considering the shear deformation and rotary inertia terms are derived. Numerical examples describe the effects of shear deformation, rotary inertia and elastic matrix on the velocity, the critical frequency, the cut-off frequency and the amplitude ratio of wave propagation in multi-walled carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic matrix, respectively. The results obtained show that wave propagation in carbon nanotubes appears in a critical frequency or a cut-off frequency for different wave modes; the effect of shear deformation decreases the value of critical frequency; the critical frequency increases as the matrix stiffness increases; the inertia rotary has an obvious influence on the wave velocity for some wave modes in the higher frequency region. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Each of the concentric tubes of MWNTs is considered an individual elastic shell and coupled with any two tubes through a rigorous vdW interaction force. The matrix surrounding MWNTs is considered a spring in which the spring coefficient is defined by the Winkler model. The results obtained show that the radial breathing frequencies of the first vibration mode increase monotonically as the stiffness of the matrix increases. The matrix surrounding MWNTs not only changes the value of amplitude ratios between any two tube walls of the MWNTs embedded in an elastic matrix, but also changes the vibration modes between the tube walls of the MWNTs from the coaxial vibration to the non-coaxial vibration. The new features and the meaningful numerical results in the present work on radial breathing vibrations of MWNTs embedded in an elastic matrix may be used as a useful reference for Raman scattering of light that can indirectly provide structural data on nanotubes. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Following the subsequent motion of a single wall (CNT) under radial impulsive pressure, a nonlinear dynamic response may occur through interaction of circumferential membrane force with flexural curvature. The results carried out show that the initial deformation energy in the single wall CNT will be transferred, over a number of cycles, from the breathing mode to one or two high flexural modes, so that the nonlinear flexural stress of the single wall CNT is significantly higher than that given by linear theory. The principal point of interest are the conditions for significant interaction to occur and the increased flexural stress associated with the altered radial motion of a single wall CNT. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

Depending on the ratio of radius to thickness, the multi-walled carbon nanotubes discussed here are classified as thin, thick, and nearly solid. Critical buckling load with the corresponding mode is obtained for multi-walled carbon nanotubes under combined torsion and axial loading, with various values of the radius to thickness ratio and surrounded with different elastic media.

33947132806	Torsional buckling of multi-walled carbon nanotubes subjected to torsional loads	The torsional buckling of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube under two different loading conditions is studied in this article. The multiple shell model is adopted and the effects of van der Waals forces between adjacent nanotubes are taken into account. An examination with an individual double-walled carbon nanotube shows that the effect of the change of interlayer spacing on the torsional buckling force can be neglected if only the innermost radius is larger than a certain value. Under this condition, single buckling equations are derived and explicit formulas for the critical torsional loads in terms of the buckling modes are obtained. It is found that the critical torsional load of a multi-walled carbon nanotube with torque exerted on the outermost tube is higher than that of the same multi-walled carbon nanotubes under the torques being proportionally applied to each individual layer of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes. For thin multi-walled carbon nanotubes with large radii, the critical torque linearly scales with its thickness, but the critical shear force (per unit length) of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes uniformly twisted along the cross section does not increase as its layer number (thickness) increases, which is due to the interlayer slips between adjacent nanotubes. © 2007 SAGE Publications.

From the point of view of continuum modeling, each of the concentric tubes of multi-walled carbon nanotubes is considered as an individual elastic shell and coupled with any two tubes through a rigorous van der Waals interaction force. Based on this model, some example calculations are carried out to describe the effect of temperature changes and van der Waals interaction models on the axially critical load of multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Some results obtained show that the axial buckling stress of multi-walled carbon nanotubes under thermal environment is dependent on the wave number of axially buckling modes, and the wave numbers corresponding to the minimum axial stress are not unique for the multi-walled carbon nanotubes under thermal environments. On the other hand, a rigorous van der Waals interaction force can make the axially critical load of multi-walled nanotubes under thermal loading increase. The effect of thermal environments on the axially critical stress of multi-walled nanotubes gradually increases as the axial half wavenumber (m) of buckling modes increases.

The effects of the matrix on the frequencies of radial breathing modes and vibration modes of multiwall carbon nanotubes embedded in the matrix is considered by a spring coefficient defined by the Winkler model. Results carried out show that the frequencies of the first mode increase monotonically as the stiffness of the matrix increase.

Results obtained show that the eccentric compression buckling mode corresponding the critical bending moment is unique, and is different from the purely axial compression buckling of an individual multi-walled carbon nanotube. For different types of multi-walled carbon nanotubes, the effect of matrix stiffness on the critical bending moment of multi-walled carbon nanotubes under eccentric compression loading is obviously different, and is dependent on the innermost radius and layer numbers of the multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

Nanoscale finite element simulations of the dynamic Young's modulus of single-walled carbon nanotubes under different strain rates and environmental temperatures reveal that the dynamic Young's modulus of the single-walled carbon nanotubes increases with the increase of strain rate, and decreases significantly with the increase of environment temperature. It is significant that the dynamic Young's modulus of zigzag nanotubes is more sensitive to strain rate and environmental temperature due to the tube chirality. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Each of the concentric tubes of multi-walled carbon nanotubes is considered as an individual elastic shell and coupled together through the van der Waals forces between two adjacent tubes. The matrix surrounding carbon nanotubes is described as a spring element defined by the Winkler model. The effects of rotatory inertia and elastic matrix on the wave velocity, the critical frequency, and the amplitude ratio between two adjacent tubes are described and discussed through numerical examples. The results obtained show that wave propagation in carbon nanotubes may appear in a critical frequency at which the wave velocity changes suddenly; the elastic matrix surrounding carbon nanotubes debases the critical frequency and the wave velocity, and changes the vibration modes between two adjacent tubes; the rotatory inertia based on an exact shell model obviously influences the wave velocity at some wave modes. Finally, a comparison of dispersion solutions from different shell models is given.

34547478762	Wave dispersion characteristics in fluid-filled carbon nanotubes embedded in an elastic medium	This paper reports the result of an investigation into the wave dispersion characteristic in fluid-filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in an elastic medium. Based on an analysis method for a coupled system between the fluid-filled and the deformation of CNTs, the effect of a surrounding medium on the response of a fluid loading term in the CNTs is described. The result obtained indicates that for different wave modes there exist corresponding critical frequencies at which the velocity of wave propagation drops dramatically and some cut-off frequencies before which the corresponding wave modes does not appear; the response of the fluid loading item in fluid-filled CNTs embedded in an elastic medium is dependent on the axial wave mode, the circumferential wave mode, the radial constraint of the surrounding elastic medium and the response frequency of the coupled system. New features for the wave dispersion characteristic and the response of a fluid loading term in fluid-filled CNTs and meaningful results are useful in the design of a nano device, where CNTs act as basic elements for a conveying fluid. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

34548697285	Wave propagation in multiwall carbon nanotubes embedded in a matrix material	This paper presents an analytical method to investigate wave propagation in individual multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) or MWNTs embedded in an elastic matrix, by using a laminated cylindrical shell mode. Each of the concentric tubes of the MWNTs is an individual elastic shell and coupled with adjacent tubes through van der Waals interaction. The effect of matrix surrounding MWNTs is considered as a spring defined by the Winkler model. The disperse curves are obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem. The wave propagation characteristics and the amplitude radio between two walls of MWNTs are described by using the dispersive curves. Results show that the matrix surrounding MWNTs takes an increase in the threshold frequency of wave propagation in the MWNTs, and the effect of matrix stiffness on the velocity and the amplitude ratio between two walls of wave propagation in MWNTs embedded in an elastic matrix is dependent on wave modes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

35148885339	Effect of environmental temperatures on elastic properties of single-walled carbon nanotube	Based on a method of molecular structural mechanics (MSM), the effect of environmental temperature on elastic properties of armchair and zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes is investigated. Single-walled carbon nanotubes with different chiral vectors are considered as a molecular structural mechanics model, which is composed of the discrete molecular structures through the carbon-to-carbon bonds. By considering the effect of environmental temperature on force constant values of the bonds stretching, bonds angle bending and torsional resistance, the corresponding basic parameters of a truss of the single-walled carbon nanotubes are obtained in different environmental temperatures, respectively. Nanoscale structural mechanics simulation for the elastic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes in different environmental temperatures reveals that the elastic modulus of single-walled carbon nanotubes decreases significantly with the increase of environmental temperature. It is noted that the Young's modulus of single-walled carbon nanotubes is more sensitive to environmental temperature than the shear modulus.

By making use of a composite finite element Ansys code and a series of experiments, the autofrettage pressure is determined in order to make the aluminium liner be totally in elastic state, under given hydrostatic test pressure. The stress intensity factors of the longitudinal crack in aluminum liner end under internal pressure and thermal loads have been computed and analyzed before and after the autofrettage processing.

The mechanical property of metal walls is considered as a linear function of temperature change. A simple comparison, not considering thermal effect with the experiment previously obtained, is used to prove that the derived mean crushing load and length of the local folding mode are reasonable. The effects of wrapping direction of the reinforcing fibers in sandwich tubes and different thermal environments on the axial crushing load are investigated. The results show that the mean crushing load of a sandwich tubes gradually decreases as the temperature change increases, which must be considered in engineering designs. © SAGE Publications 2008.

33244461032	Bending stability of multiwalled carbon nanotubes	This paper reports the results of an investigation on bending stability of an individual multiwalled carbon nanotube. Based on the point of view of continuum modeling, a multilayer shell model is presented for the pure bending buckling of an individual multiwalled carbon nanotube, in which the effect of van der Waals forces between adjacent two tubes is taken into account. Here, the critical bending moment and the bending buckling mode for three types of multiwalled carbon nanotubes with different layer numbers and ratios of radius to thickness are calculated. Results carried out show that the bending buckling mode corresponding the critical bending moment is unique, which is obviously different from the purely axial compression buckling of an individual multiwalled carbon nanotube. It is also seen from numerical examples that the distribution of the critical bending strain for each tube of multiwalled carbon nanotubes under bending is dependent on the radius-to-thickness ratio and the layer number of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes.

32044472539	Hygrothermal effects on interfacial stress transfer characteristics of carbon nanotubes-reinforced composites system	On the basis of the existence of strong bonding between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polymer matrix, and considering the axial and radial thermal expansion coefficients of CNTs as nonlinear functions of temperature changes, this article presents an analytical method to investigate hygrothermal effects on the interfacial stress transfer characteristics of single-multiwalled CNTs-reinforced composites system under hygrothermal loading by means of thermoelastic theory and conventional fiber pullout models. According to the known literature, the thermal expansion coefficient of CNTs is considered as transverse isotropy, and is a nonlinear function of temperature changes. The thermal expansion coefficient of polymer matrix is isotropy, and is a linear function of temperature changes. Numerical examples show that the interfacial shear stress transfer behavior can be described and affected by several parameters such as the temperature changes in CNTs-polymer composite, the moisture concentration changes in polymer matrix, the layer numbers, volume fractions, and chiral vectors of CNTs. From the results obtained it is found that mismatch of the thermal and moisture expansion coefficients between the CNTs and polymer matrix may be more important in governing interfacial stress transfer characteristics of CNTs-reinforced composites system. © 2006 SAGE Publications.

33644950439	Stress wave propagation in piezoelectric fiber reinforced laminated composites subjected to thermal shock	This paper presents an analytical solution for stress wave propagation in piezoelectric fiber reinforced laminated composites subjected to thermal shock loading. The thermoelectrodynamic equation for each separate material layer is solved by means of finite Hankel transforms and Laplace transforms. Then by using the interface continuity conditions between the piezoelectric fiber layer and the matrix layer, and the boundary condition at the external surface of the piezoelectric fiber reinforced laminated composite the unknown constants are determined. Thus, an exact solution for stress wave propagation in piezoelectric fiber reinforced laminated composites subjected to thermal shock loading is obtained. From the exact analytical expression and the corresponding numerical example, this paper reveals some phenomena of the dynamic focusing effect of a piezoelectric fiber reinforced composite laminated cylinder subjected to thermal shock of a transitory temperature change. The dynamic focusing effect gives rise to very higher tensile stress magnitudes and electric potential at the center of the piezoelectric fiber, which easily results in a fracture along the axial direction of the piezoelectric fiber at the higher tensile stress region. It is important to know the mechanism of the dynamic focusing effect of the piezoelectric fiber reinforced laminated composites to evaluate the dynamic strength and electric signal of the composite systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that compressive strength of CQ increases with increasing strain-rates, while for EB the compressive strength at strain-rate 1500/s is lower then that at 800/s or 400/s. More interestingly, most of the stress strain curves of both of the two composites are not monotonous but exhibit double-peak shape. To identify this unusual phenominon, a high speed photographic system is introduced. The deformation as well as fracture characteristics of the composites under dynamic loadings were captured. The photoes indicate that two different failure mechanisms work during dynamic fracture process. The first one is axial splitting between the fiber and the matrix and the second one is overall shear. The interficial strength between the fiber and matrix, which is also strain rate dependent, determines the fracture modes and the shape of the stress/strain curves.

84875065060	Effects of axial loading on the coupling vibration in bioliquid-filled microtubules	Objective: To describe the effects of axial loading, small-scale parameter, bioliquid density in a microtubule (MT) and constrained stiffness of surrounding biomedium on the coupling vibration frequency in the bioliquid-filled MT, and to provide references for ultrasonic inspection on nano-MT under axial loading and the clinical application of biological medicine. Methods: The non-local elastic theory was utilized to describe the nano-scale characteristics of the MT, and the analytic solutions to the coupling vibration frequency of the bioliquid-filled MT under axial loading were given. Results: The axial loading exerted on the bioliquid-filled MT made the couple vibration frequency drop rapidly, and as the small-scale effect increased, the couple vibration frequency of the bioliquid-filled MT was gradually decreased. The effect of axial loading on the couple vibration frequency of the bioliquid-filled MT was larger than that of the small-scale parameter. Conclusions: When the density of bioliquid in MT increases, the first order frequency of the bioliquid-filled MT embedded in biomedium is decreased; when the initial axial loading exerted on the bioliquid-filled MT increases, the effect of bioliquid density in MT on the first order frequency of bioliquid-filled MT is reduced gradually.

84877971984	Effects of thermal and electric environments on lemniscate delaminated buckling near the surface of piezoelectric laminated shells	In this article, an analytical method is applied to investigate the local buckling of a lemniscate delimitated shape near the surface of piezoelectric laminated shells subjected to coupled thermal, electric, and mechanical loadings. Here, the Young's modulus and the thermal expansion coefficients of the material are treated as functions of temperature change in the piezoelectric cylindrical laminated shells, and the geometrical axes of local lemniscate delamination are inconsistent with the geometrical main axes of piezoelectric laminated base-shells. In examples, the effects of thermal and electric environments, geometrical parameters, and material properties on the local buckling for lemniscate delamination near the surface of piezoelectric laminated base-shells are described and discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

In examples, the effects of thermal loading, electric field strength, the stacking patterns of functionally graded laminated piezoelectric composite shells and the patterns of delaminations on the critical axial loading of locally delaminated buckling are described and discussed. Finally, the possible growth directions of local buckling for delaminated sub-shells are described by calculating the expanding forces along the length and short axis of the delaminated sub-shells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84900031937	Dynamic stability of carbon nanotubes reinforced composites	Based on an effective model of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and Donnell-shell theory, an analytical method is presented to study dynamic stability characteristics of multi-walled carbon nanotubes reinforced composites considering the surface effect of carbon nanotubes. From obtained results it is seen that carbon nanotubes composites, under combined static and periodic axial loads, may occur in a parametric resonance, the parametric resonance frequency of dynamic instability regions of CNTs reinforced composites under axially oscillation loading enhances as the stiffness of matrix surrounding CNTs increases, and the surface effective modulus and residue stress of carbon nanotubes make the parametric resonance frequency and the region breadth of dynamic instability of carbon nanotubes reinforced composites increase. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84906097563	The evolution of void defects in metallic films based on a nonlocal phase field model	In this paper, a nonlocal phase field method is presented to solve anisotropic diffusion-driven morphological evolution and migration of void defects in finite metallic film interconnects by utilizing a nonlocal phase field model considering a small scale effect. The nonlocal elastic theory is used to describe a small scale effect on the morphological evolution and migration of the void. In example calculations, the effects of the stress field, the electric field, and the anisotropic diffusion characteristic on the evolution of void defects in finite metallic film interconnects are described and discussed. The result in comparison with literature shows that the small scale effect based on nonlocal elastic model induces the migration diffusion of the crack tip to decrease. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

11244286075	Thermo-electro-elastic transient responses in piezoelectric hollow structures	The paper presents an analytical method to solve thermo-electro-elastic transient response in piezoelectric hollow structures subjected to arbitrary thermal shock, sudden mechanical load and electric excitation. Volterra integral equation of the second kind caused by interaction between elastic deformation and electric field is solved by using an interpolation method. Thus, the exact expressions for the transient responses of displacement, stresses, electric displacement and electric potential in the piezoelectric hollow structures are obtained by means of Hankel transform, Laplace transform, and their inverse transforms. In Section 2, based on spherical coordinates, the governing equation of thermo-electro-elastic transient responses in a piezoelectric hollow sphere is found and the associated numerical results are carried out. In Section 3, based on cylindrical coordinates, the governing equation of thermo-electro-elastic transient responses in a non-homogeneous piezoelectric hollow cylinder is found and the corresponding numerical results are carried out. The results carried out may be used as a reference to solve other transient coupled problems of thermo-electro-elasticity in piezoelectric structures. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

13844281843	Axially critical load of multiwall carbon nanotubes under thermal environment	The axially compressed buckling of multiwall carbon nanotubes under thermal environment is studied. The effects of temperature changes and van der Waals interaction forces between the inner and outer walls of nanotubes are taken into account. From the point of view of continuum modeling, an elastic multilayer shell model considering van der Waals forces is presented for the axially compressed buckling of multiwall carbon nanotubes under thermal environment. Based on this model, some example calculations are carried out to describe the effect of temperature changes on the axially critical load of multiwall carbon nanotubes. Finally, some results obtained show that the axial buckling stress of multiwalled carbon nanotubes under thermal environment is dependent on the wave number of axially buckling modes, and the wave numbers corresponding to the minimum axial stress are not unique for the multiwall carbon nanotubes under thermal environments.
