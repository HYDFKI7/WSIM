8844232694	Intestinal obstruction due to bezoars in a patient with hypothyroidism - A case report	Formation of bezoars in the normal gastrointestinal tract is rare. Most patients with a bezoar have distorted anatomy, often secondary to a previous gastrectomy or vagotomy. Patients with hypothyroidism commonly have constipation and gastrointestinal hypomotility, but there are few reports of intestinal obstruction associated with hypothyroidism. We report a 57-year-old woman with hypothyroidism that related to thyroid carcinoma post total thyroidectomy, but no history of gastric surgery. She developed intestinal obstruction caused by two bezoars in the small intestine, which were identified on abdominal CT. She underwent emergency laparotomy, with removal of the bezoars, one in the jejunum and one in the ileum. After this bowel decompression and lysis of adhesions, her symptoms resolved. She recovered well after surgery, and her hypothyroidism was treated. In this case, hypothyroidism may have been a predisposing factor for development of the bezoars that caused intestinal obstruction.

9144262992	Does surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma accelerate cancer dissemination?	Aim: This study was to investigate whether surgery could increase cancer dissemination and postoperative recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by detection of human α-fetoprotein messenger RNA (hAFP mRNA). hAFP mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with HCC has been considered as a surrogate marker for circulating tumor cells. Methods: Eighty-one consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for HCC entered this prospective cohort study. We examined hAFP mRNA from the peripheral blood obtained preoperatively, perioperatively, and postoperatively to correlate the prognosis after curative resections from HCC patients and from the control subjects. Detection of hAFP mRNA by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) was performed with primers specifically. The relations between the clinical variables (age, sex, associated liver cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection, serum α-fetoprotein and Child-Pugh class), the histological variables (size, capsule, vascular permeation, grade of differentiation, and daughter nodules), hAFP mRNA in peripheral blood of 3 different sessions, and postoperative course (recurrence, and recurrence related death) were analysed. Results: No hAFP mRNA was detected in control group subjects. Twenty-two (27%), 24 (30%) and 19 (23%) of 81 HCC patients had hAFP mRNA positivity in the preoperative, perioperative and postoperative peripheral blood. The preoperative presence did not influence the risk of HCC recurrence (55% vs 41%, P=0.280). In contrast, patients with postoperative presence had a significantly higher recurrence (90% vs 31%, P<0.001; odds ratio 19.2; 95% confidence interval: 4.0-91.7). In the multivariate analysis by COX proportional hazards model, postoperative positivity had a significant influence on recurrence (P=0.067) and recurrence related mortality (P=0.017). Whereas, the perioperative positivity of hAFP mRNA did not increase HCC recurrence (58% vs.39%, P=0.093). The correlation between perioperative hAFP mRNA positivity and recurrence related mortality had no statistical significance (P=0.836). Conclusion: From our study, perioperative detection of hAFP mRNA in peripheral blood of patients has no clinical relevance and significant role in the prediction of HCC recurrence. Surgical resection itself may not accelerate cancer dissemination and does not increase postoperative recurrence significantly either.

14944358651	Pseudopneumoperitoneum - A case report	Pneumoperitoneum is one of the most distinctive sign in hallow organ perforation of acute abdomen. Most of the cases of pneumoperitoneum required emergent surgery. But we must also consider other conditions, which may cause pseudopneumoperitoneum, such as atelectasis, subphrenic abscess, meteorism, colonic interposition and distended gastric fundus. A 67-year-old male with a history of emphysema was a case that his linear atelectasis was erroneously diagnosed as pneumoperitoneum. It was difficult to differentiate pseudopneumoperitoneum from pneumoperitoneum merely by chest films. Herein, we emphasize the importance of differential diagnosis of acute abdomen between pneumoperitoneum and pseudopneumoperitoneum. If it is still hard to exclude any possibility, abdominal computed tomography is a gold standard of recognizing free air in difficult diagnosis cases.

1642351114	Primary angiosarcoma of the liver - A case report	A fifty-nine years old female was healthy before and had no any past history. She came to our hospital for tumor screening because her family had hepatocellular carcinoma. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic tumor about 3 cm in size located at right lobe of liver. Abdominal CT revealed an ill-defined, irregular and moderately enhanced tumor at right liver. Angiography revealed nonspecific vascular stain at right liver. Laboratory data was within normal limit. Laparotomy with intraoperative ultrasound found a tumor with intratumorous hemorrhage at right liver and segmental hepatectomy was performed. Pathologic finding was one malignant vascular tumor with predominent spindle cells and vascular spaces lined by atypical endothelial cells. Angiosarcoma was diagnosed. After excision of tumor, the patient was well. She was followed up regularly at our OPD and had no evidence of recurrence.

1542790477	Salvage therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with thalidomide	Aim: To evaluate the clinical benefit of thalidomide in patients th advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma). Methods: From March 2000 to July 2002, patients who had advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and failed to or were unsuited for aggressive treatment, were enrolled and took thalidomide 150 to 300 mg/d. All cases were followed till April 2003. Data collection included viral hepatitis, grade of cirrhosis, total dosage of thalidomide, side effect, stage of hepatoma by Okuda and CLIP classification, and prognosis. The subjects were divided into A and B groups, depending on 5 000 mg dosage of thalidomide. Survival time of all cases and in the two subgroups was evaluated. Results: Ninety-nine patients with hepatoma were enrolled, 81 men and 18 females with median age 58±14.1 years. Eighty-six percent had viral hepatitis and one case was alcoholism. Hepatoma was diagnosed with histology, alpha-fetoprotein (aFP) >400 ng/mL, or image examination, there were 30, 33 and 36 cases respectively. At the time of thalidomide therapy, more than 81% had cirrhotic status. Twenty-two patients were in group A (<5 000 mg) with median survival time about 25 days, for 77 cases in group B (≥5 000 mg) the median survival time was about 109 days. Six subjects had partial response. Most adverse effects were skin rush, neuropathy, somnolence, and constipation. Conclusion: Several patients responded to thalidomide therapy. As a single drug therapy, thalidomide might not have good therapeutic effect for all cases, but a small ratio of patients had exciting response, the resistance or tumor escape would develop after long-term use. Up to now, no defined facts could be used to predict response. The effect of thalidomide on hepatoma might be associated with the dosage. As salvage therapy, thalidomide has its value. Combination or adjuvant therapy will be the next trial. Copyright © 2004 by The WJG Press.

14844362865	Report of gossypiboma from the standpoint in medicine and law	We report on a case of gossypiboma. A 78-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with acute abdomen. He had undergone an operation for colon cancer 4 mo previously. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an echogenic lesion with a hypoechoic rim and strong posterior acoustic shadowing in the lower abdomen. Diagnosis of gossypiboma can be made by ultrasonography to avoid loss-of-chance of survival. We reviewed the English literature briefly of gossypiboma from the medical and juridical view. According to the theory of loss-of-chance, the damage of plaintiff is the loss of the chance of survival or recovery, rather than the final harm. The victim would allow recovery for the loss of the chance from the defendant. But the plaintiff would show by a preponderance that he was deprived of a betterchance of a cure. Under the proposed rule, the compensable value of the victim would be the plaintiff's compensation for the loss of the victim's chance of survival. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

17144413364	Adenocarcinoma and infection in a solitary hepatic cyst: A case report	Solitary non-parasitic liver cysts are being increasingly diagnosed due to the increased use of abdominal sonography. The majority of solitary liver cysts are asymptomatic; however, there are some complications which include infection, perforation, spontaneous hemorrhage, obstructive jaundice and neoplastic degeneration. In some cases a cystic liver lesion may mimic a tumor and is difficult to differentiate with standard imaging studies or fine needle aspiration cytology. Here in, we report a case of adenocarcinoma arising in a solitary hepatic cyst complicated with Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. High levels of CEA in the cyst fluid levels suggested malignancy, which was confirmed by pathology of the resected specimen. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1942531634	Duodenal carcinoid tumor: A case report	Carcinoid occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine. A carinid in the duodenum is very rare. We report an 86-year-old aboriginal man complaining of epigastralgia, vomiting of coffee ground material, and weight loss. Evaluation of possible obstriction led to the discovery fo a tumor in the first part of the duodenum. The tumor and surrounding lymph nodes were resected and a Whipple procedure performed. The tumor and several nodes were possitive for chromogranin, synaptophysin and NSE on immunocytichemical staining. Therefore, a duodenal carcinoid tumor with lymph node metastases was diagnosed. We reviewed the literature and discussed the incidence, etiology, dignosis, treatment and prognosis of duodenal carcinoid tumor. The entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of duodenal malignancy.

18444387118	Androgen receptor exon 1 CAG repeat length and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in women	The androgen receptor (AR) gene is localized on chromosome X, and shorter CAG repeats in exon 1 of the AR gene were recently suggested to increase hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk among men. To examine whether the relationship between the AR-CAG repeats and HCC was also evident among women, we conducted a case-control study in Taiwan. The number of AR-CAG repeats was determined for 238 women with HCC and 354 unrelated control subjects (comprising 188 first-degree and 166 nonbiological relatives) selected from female relatives of patients with HCC. Women harboring 2 AR alleles with more than 23 CAG repeats had an increased risk of HCC (ageadjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% CI, 1.06-3.14), compared with women with only short alleles or a single long allele. The association between harboring 2 AR alleles containing longer CAG repeats and HCC was more striking among HBV carriers (age-adjusted OR for more than 22 repeats, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.14-4.34) and particularly prominent among HBV carriers under age 53 years (age-adjusted OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 1.13-8.82). When CAG repeats were analyzed as a continuous variable, the increase in HCC risk associated with each incremental repeat in the shorter of 2 alleles in a given genotype was statistically significant among women with a first-degree relative with HCC (age-adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37). No such relationship was detected among women without the family history. In conclusion, our observations suggest that the AR-CAG alleles may contribute to HCC predisposition among women through a mechanism different from that for men.

19944428026	Expression patterns of transforming growth factor-beta and its receptors in gastric mucosa of patients with refractory gastric ulcer	Aim: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a regulatory role in tissue repair. In a previous study, we found that TGF-β and its receptors were expressed in gastric mucosa of patients with well-healed gastric ulcers, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. To further characterize the role of TGF-β and its receptors in repairing gastric ulcers, we investigated the expression patterns of TGF-β and its receptors in gastric mucosa by in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods: Seventy-four patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcers were eligible for participation in this study.

23144435359	Clinical analysis of multiple primary malignancies in the digestive system: A hospital-based study	Aim: To analyze the characteristics of multiple primary malignancies (MPMs) of digestive system; including incidence, types of tumor combinations, time intervals between development of multiple tumors, clinical course, and prognostic factors affecting survival and mortality. Methods: Data from a total of 129 patients treated from January 1991 to December 2000 for pathologically proved MPMs, including at least one originating from the digestive system, were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Among 129 patients, 120 (93.02%) had two primary cancers and 9 (6.98%) had three primary cancers. The major sites of MPMs of the digestive system were large intestine, stomach, and liver. Associated non-digestive cancers included 40 cases of gynecological cancers, of which 31 were carcinoma of cervix and 10 cases of genitourinary cancers, of which 5 were bladder cancers. Other cancers originated from the lung, breast, nasopharynx, larynx, thyroid, brain, muscle, and skin. Reproductive tract cancers, especially cervical, ovarian, bladder, and prostate cancers were the most commonly associated non-GI cancers, followed by cancer of the lung and breasts. Forty-three cases were synchronous, while the rest (86 cases) were metachronous cancers. Staging of MPMs and treatment regimes correlated with the prognosis between survival and non-survival groups. Conclusion: As advances in cancer therapy bring about a progressively larger percentage of long-term survivors, the proportion of patients with subsequent primary lesions will increase. Early diagnosis of these lesions, based on an awareness of the possibility of second and third cancers, and multidisciplinary treatment strategies will substantially increase the survival of these patients. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

23144458299	Colchicine sensitizes human hepatocellular carcinoma cells to damages caused by radiation	Aim: We studied the effect of colchicine combined with radiation on the survival of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HA22T/VGH cells. Methods: Twenty-four hours after treatment with 0-8 ng/mL colchicine, HA22T/VGH cells were irradiated at various doses (0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 Gy). Colony assay was performed to assess the surviving cell fraction. Survival curves were fitted by using a linear-quadratic model to estimate the sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER). Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis. Results: Colchicine at lower concentrations (1 and 2 ng/mL) had obvious synergy with radiation to inhibit HCC cell growth, whereas higher concentrations (4 and 8 ng/mL) had only additive effect to radiation. Pretreatment with 1 and 2 ng/mL colchicine for 24-h enhanced cell killing by radiation with SERs of 1.21 and 1.53, respectively. G

0029828276	Retroperitoneal tuberculous lymphadenitis mimicking a pancreatic head tumor: Report of a case	This reported case concerns a 28-year-old male suffering from fever of unknown origin. An intraabdominal tumor was found at the pancreatic head portion by ultrasonography. A pancreatic head tumor was suspected initially. Abdominal computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography also revealed a pancreatic head lesion. Laparotomy was performed later and an enlarged lymph node around the pancreatic head was noted. The pathology report was consistent with the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. Anti-tuberculous therapy was given and the patient became afebrile. This case is the first that we have encountered. The clinical features, pathogenesis and treatment of the retroperitoneal tuberculous lymphadenitis are described with a brief review and discussion.

0029856208	Hepatic hydrothorax: Clinical experience and analysis	Hepatic hydrothorax has been recognized as a pleural effusion complicated with cirrhosis of the liver. The reported incidence in literature is 4-6%. However, the etiology and management of this disorder is disputed and problematic. From January 1990 through July 1994, we found 72 cases of hepatic hydrothorax coming from 2,490 hospitalized patients of liver cirrhosis. The incidence is 3% in this study. We selected 42 patients (25 males and 17 females) of symptomatic hepatic hydrothorax for clinical analysis and investigation. The patient's age ranged from a 25-year-old to an 82 year-old with a mean age of 57.0 years. The etiology of liver cirrhosis was hepatitis B (24 patients), hepatitis C (9 patients), alcoholic (7 patients), biliary (1 patient), and Wilson's disease (1 patient). Most of the cases were classified as Child's B and C status. Location of hydrothorax showed 33 in right, 9 in bilateral, and none in left alone. Initial aspirates from the peritoneocentesis proved transudative except one with bloody nature. Hypoalbuminemia (<3.5 gm/dl) is a very common feature (88%, 37/42). Clinical analysis showed splenomegaly in 26 cases, cytopenia in 8 cases, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 11 cases. Panendoscopy was performed in 26 out of the 42 patients. Eighty-five percent (85%) demonstrated esophagogastric varices (EV, 20 cases; EV + GV, 2 cases). All of the patients received salt restriction, diuretics, and albumin replacement. Paracentesis, thoracostomy with chemical pleurodesis, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and peritoneovenous shunt were performed according to individual consideration. The main purpose of the treatment of this disorder is the intervention to eliminate the ascites and pleural effusion, as well as to avoid complications. Only 6 out of 30 follow-up cases survived for 4 years. The major causes of death were hepatic failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and sepsis.

24044463851	Etoposide sensitizes CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma to radiation therapy in BALB/c mice	Aim: To investigate the combined effect of etoposide and radiation on CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma implanted into BALB/c mice. Methods: We evaluated the radiosensitizing effect of etoposide on CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma in a syngeneic animal model. BALB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with CT26 cells and divided into four groups: control (intra-peritoneal salinex2) group, etoposide (5 mg/kg intra-peritoneallyx2) group, radiation therapy (RT 5 Gyx2 fractions) group, and combination therapy with etoposide (5 mg/kg intra-peritoneally 1 h before radiation) group. Results: Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by RT and combination therapy. The effect of combination therapy was better than that of RT. No significant changes were noted in body weight, plasma alanine aminotransferase, or creatinine in any group. The leukocyte count significantly but transiently decreased in the RT and combination therapy groups, but not in the etoposide and control groups. There was no skin change or hair loss in the RT and combination therapy groups. Conclusion: Etoposide can sensitize CT26 colorectal adenocarcinoma in BALB/c mice to RT without significant toxicity. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

24644433860	Acute pancreatitis caused by tapeworm in the biliary tract	Taeniasis is a helminthic infection endemic in southeast Asia, including Taiwan. Recent studies suggest that Asian Taenia is a new subspecies of Taenia saginata and has been renamed as Taenia saginata asiatica. It is usually asymptomatic or associated with only mild gastrointestinal symptoms. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with acute epigastric pain and vomiting. Her levels of amylase and lipase were significantly elevated on admission. Gastrointestinal endoscopy showed proglottids of a tapeworm in the papilla of the duodenum. The epigastric pain subsided and the amylase and lipase levels decreased after removal of the tapeworm by endoscopy and anthelminthic treatment. Although parasites are not an uncommon cause of pancreatitis, especially in disease-endemic areas, it is rare for Taenia to cause acute pancreatitis.

24144453352	Ultrasonography of splenic abnormalities	Aim: This report gives a comprehensive overview of ultrasonography of splenic abnormalities. Certain ultrasonic features are also discussed with pathologic correlation. Methods: We review the typical ultrasonic characteristics of a wide range of splenic lesions, illustrating them with images obtained in our institution from 2000 to 2003. One hundred and three patients (47 men, 56 women), with a mean age of 54 years (range 9-92 years), were found to have an abnormal ultrasonic pattern of spleen. Results: We describe the ultrasonic features of various splenic lesions such as accessory spleen, splenomegaly, cysts, cavernous hemangiomas, lymphomas, abscesses, metastatic tumors, splenic infarctions, hematomas, and rupture, based on traditional gray-scale and color Doppler sonography. Conclusion: Ultrasound is a widely available, noninvasive, and useful means of diagnosing splenic abnormalities. A combination of ultrasonic characteristics and clinical data may provide an accurate diagnosis. If the US appearance alone is not enough, US may also be used to guide biopsy of suspicious lesions. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

28044439385	Analysis of clinical manifestations of symptomatic acquired jejunoileal diverticular disease	Aim: To analyze systematically our experience over 22 years with symptomatic acquired diverticular disease of the jejunum and ileum, exploring the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this rare but life-threatening disease. Methods: The medical records of patients with surgically confirmed symptomatic jejunoileal diverticular disease were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included demographic data, laboratory results, clinical course (acute or chronic), preoperative diagnosis, and operative findings. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) surgical confirmation of jejunoileal diverticular disease and (2) exclusion of congenital diverticula (e.g. Meckel's diverticulum). Results: From January 1982 to July 2004, 28 patients with a total of 29 operations met the study criteria. The male:female ratio was 14:14, and the mean age was 62.6±3.5 years. The most common manifestation was abdominal pain. In nearly half of the patients, the symptoms were chronic. Two patients died after surgery. Only four cases were correctly diagnosed prior to surgery, three by small bowel series. Conclusion: Symptomatic acquired small bowel diverticular disease is difficult to diagnose. It should be considered in older patients with unexplained chronic abdominal symptoms. A small bowel series may be helpful in diagnosing this potentially life-threatening disease. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

2942650289	Pseudoachalasia: A case report	Primary achalasia is an idiopathic functional disorder of esophageal motility. However, some patients have symptoms consistent with achalasia which are actually caused by other organic lesions, not neuromuscular dysfunction of the distal esophagus and cardia. This is called pseudoachalasia. It is caused most frequently by malignancy, with benign causes being extremely rare. Although there are certain symptoms and signs that may help differentiate between pseudoachalasia and idiopathic achalasia, the distinction may still be difficult. We present a patient with pancreatic carcinoma who had symptoms of progressive dysphagia. The UGI endoscopy and a barium esophagogram showed findings typical of achalasia. Thus, neither clinical features nor routine imaging studies are absolutely specific for idiopathic achalasia. This may explain why about 4% of patients presenting with symptoms consistent with achalasia in fact have pseudoachalasia. Because of the tremendous difference in treatment and prognosis of these two entities, we must be very careful in accepting a diagnosis of idiopathic achalasia and proceeding with treatment. If there is any doubt as to the correct diagnosis, further evaluation is indicated.

33646248090	Marked elevation of serum transaminase in acute cholangitis - A case report	In the absence of other hepatobiliary or pancreatic disease, choledocholithiasis can result in elevation in AST and ALT greater than 400 IU/L. Isolated marked elevation in AST and ALT levels over 1000 IU/L has been reported infrequently in patients with choledocholithiasis. These levels fall markedly once the disease is appropriately managed. We report here one 51-year-old female with serum transaminase level greater than 900 IU/L, a rare occurrence in patient with choledocholithiasis. The possibility of acute virus hepatitis has been excluded by abdominal sonography and virus markers. CBD stones were identified by ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) and removed by mechanical lithotripsy. Serum transaminases return to normal levels in about 14 days. Herein, we emphasize the importance of differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis between choledocholithiasis and virus hepatitis. Marked elevation in transaminase levels in patients with acute extrahepatic biliary disease lead to confusion with primary hepatocellular disease.

33744529661	Optimal injection volume of epinephrine for endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding	Aim: To define the optimal injection volume of epinephrine with high efficacy for hemostasis and low complication rate in patients with actively bleeding ulcers. Methods: This prospective, randomized, comparative trial was conducted in a medical center. A total of 228 patients with actively bleeding ulcers (spurting or oozing) were randomly assigned to three groups with 20, 30 and 40 mL endoscopic injections of an 1:10 000 solution of epinephrine. The hemostatic effects and clinical outcomes were compared between the three groups. Results: There were no significant differences in all background variables between the three groups. Initial hemostasis was achieved in 97.4%, 98.7% and 100% of patients respectively in the 20, 30 and 40 mL epinephrine groups. There were no significant differences in the rate of initial hemostasis between the three groups. The rate of peptic ulcer perforation was significantly higher in the 40 mL epinephrine group than in the 20 and 30 mL epinephrine groups (P < 0.05). The rate of recurrent bleeding was significantly higher in the 20 mL epinephrine group (20.3%) than in the 30 (5.3%) and 40 mL (2.8 %) epinephrine groups (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the rates of surgical intervention, the amount of transfusion requirements, the days of hospitalization, the deaths from bleeding and 30 d mortality between the three groups. The number of patients who developed epigastric pain due to endoscopic injection, was significantly higher in the 40 mL epinephrine group (51/76) than in the 20 (2/76) and 30 mL (5/76) epinephrine groups (P < 0.001). Significant elevation of systolic blood pressure after endoscopic injection was observed in the 40 mL epinephrine group (P < 0.01). Significant decreasing and normalization of pulse rates after endoscopic injections were observed in the 20 mL and 30 mL epinephrine groups (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Injection of 30 mL diluted epinephrine (1:10 000) can effectively prevent recurrent bleeding with a low rate of complications. The optimal injection volume of epinephrine for endoscopic treatment of an actively bleeding ulcer (spurting or oozing) is 30 mL. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33747596196	Clinical implications of C-kit gene mutation in patients with large gastrointestinal stromal tumors	Background and Aim: To evaluate the clinical implications of C-kit gene mutation in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) greater than 10 cm in size. Methods: All cases of pathologically diagnosed GIST with positive CD117 immunostaining from one hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Tissue from the 25 patients with tumors greater than 10 cm in diameter were collected and DNA was extracted. Exons 9, 11, and 13 of the C-kit gene were analyzed and the mutations compared with the clinical and pathological characteristics of the corresponding tumors. Results: Of the 25 tumors studied, 16 had C-kit gene mutations and nine did not. Of the 16 with mutations, there were four with exon 9 mutations, 12 with exon 11 mutations, and none with exon 13 mutations. Gene mutations were more frequent in male than female patients (12/13, 92% vs 4/12, 33%). There were no significant differences in age, resectability, recurrence rate, tumor characteristics (ulceration, necrosis, hemorrhage and mitotic counts), or survival in patients with or without gene mutations. Conclusions: C-kit gene mutations were frequently found in patients with large GIST, more commonly in men than in women. However, the presence of a mutation was not predictive of prognosis in patients with large GIST. © 2006 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

33750586586	Safety and efficacy of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in patients 85 years of age and older	Background: Life expectancy is increasing in Taiwan and the prevalence of bile duct stones rises with age. ERCP has an established role in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatobillary disease, but little information is available on the outcome of this procedure in patients 85 years of age and older. Aim: To review our experience of ERCP in patients 85 years and older. Patients and Methods: Patients 85 years of age or older who underwent ERCP from January 1996 to December 2005 were studied retrospectively. Results: A total of 58 patients underwent 84 ERCP procedures (range 1-4 per patient). Twenty two patients (38%) have no recorded chronic concomitant disease. The most frequent chronic disease is cardiovascular disease (40%). The most frequent indications were suspicion of bile duct stones or bile duct dilatation (83%) and acute cholangitis (61%). Successful cannulation of the CBD was achieved in 94% of cases. Diagnoses included bile duct dilatation (80.9%), bile duct stones (70.2%) and malignancy (9.5%). Therapeutic procedures were indicated in 81% of diagnosed patients and completed in 81.1% of cases. Complications occurred in association with 10.7% of the ERCP procedures. Procedure-related mortality had noted in 1 case (1.2%). Conclusion: ERCP is a safe and effective procedure in the management of pancreatobiliary diseases in patients 85 years of age or older.

33947668854	Primary malignant tumors of the small intestine: 11-year experience in a regional hospital in Taitung	Primary malignant tumors of the small intestine represent less than 2% of all gastrointestinal malignancies. In Taiwan, published investigations of these tumors have been limited to hospitals on the west coast. We retrospectively evaluated cases of small bowel malignancies seen at our hospital in Taitung on the east coast of Taiwan from April 1995 to March 2006. The most common diagnoses among the 15 cases we found were stromal tumor, followed by adenocarcinoma, lymphoma and carcinoid tumor. For unknown reasons, lymphoma appeared to be less common in our series than in those before 1991 from western Taiwan. The incidence of these tumors was higher in the aboriginal as compared with the non-aboriginal population of Taitung, although a larger series is probably needed to confirm the discrepancy. The leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma have been more recently classified as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In our series, more men than women had small bowel malignancies. The average age at diagnosis was 61.8, and the commonest symptom was abdomen pain. Not surprisingly, survival was better among patients with tumors discovered in the early stage. Greater awareness of the possibility of these rare cancers might enhance early diagnosis.

34347401714	Large-volume endoscopic injection of epinephrine plus normal saline for peptic ulcer bleeding	Background and Aim: Large-volume endoscopic injection of epinephrine has been proven to significantly reduce rates of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding. Injection of normal saline may be equally effective for the similar hemostatic effect of local tamponade. The aim of our study was to compare the therapeutic effects of large-volume (40 mL) endoscopic injections of epinephrine, normal saline and a combination of the two in patients with active bleeding ulcers. Method: A total of 216 patients with actively bleeding ulcers (spurting or oozing) were randomly assigned to three groups (1:10 000 epinephrine, normal saline or diluted epinephrine plus normal saline). The hemostatic effects and clinical outcomes were compared between the three groups. Results: The initial hemostatic rate was significantly lower in the normal saline group (P < 0.05). The volume of injected solution required for the arrest of bleeding was significantly larger in the normal saline group (P < 0.01). Mean duration for arrest of bleeding was significantly longer in the normal saline group (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to the rates of recurrent bleeding, surgical intervention, 30-day mortality, amount of transfusion and duration of hospitalization. Significant elevation of systolic blood pressure (P < 0.05) and persistent high pulse rate after endoscopic injection were observed in the epinephrine group. Conclusions: For patients with active bleeding ulcers (spurting or oozing), we recommend a large-volume (40 mL) combination injection using diluted epinephrine to cease bleeding, followed by injection of normal saline to achieve sustained hemostasis. © 2006 The Authors.

0032730673	Immunohistochemical studies of transforming growth factor-β and its receptors in the gastric mucosa of patients with refractory gastric ulcer	Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β regulates cell growth and differentiation, and is known to play regulatory roles in the process of tissue repair and remodeling. However, the functional role of TGF-β in gastric ulcer healing has not been addressed. In this study, we assayed the expression of TGF-β and its receptors in the gastric mucosa of patients with healed or refractory gastric ulcers. Antibodies against TGF-β and its receptors (both type I and type II) were employed to examine expression levels. Sixteen gastric ulcer patients, including four with completely healed ulcers and 12 with ulcers refractory to treatment were included in this study. All four patients with healed ulcers showed remarkable expression levels of both TGFβ and its receptors. On the other hand, two of the 12 patients with refractory ulcers had weak or deficient TGF-β expression in the gastric mucosa, and seven lacked expression of at least one of the TGF-β receptors. The remaining three patients had normal (moderate to weak) expression levels of TGF-β and its two receptors. These results suggest that both TGF-β and its receptors are essential for gastric ulcer healing.

33644968227	Hepatocellular carcinoma presenting as testicular mass: A case report	An 84-year-old man presented with an enlarged scrotum. He had no gastrointestinal complaints. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a 2-cm left testicular mass and a 1-cm mass on the right. The serum PSA and β-HCG were in the normal range, but his AFP level was very high. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a huge tumor in the left lobe of liver. A bilateral orchiectomy was performed, and pathology examination demonstrated hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the left testis. Adenocarcinoma from any source very rarely metastasizes to the testis. We found only two reports of hepatocellular carcinoma with testicular metastases in the English literature.

34247386290	Identification of ectopic pancreas in the ileum by capsule endoscopy	Ectopic pancreas, an uncommon submucosal tumor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, is histologically similar to normal pancreatic tissue. We present a case of ectopic pancreas in the ileum. A 35-year-old man had intermittent dark bloody stool for 2 months accompanied by epigastric pain and postprandial abdominal fullness. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any abnormalities. Capsule endoscopy revealed a small red polyp in the ileum. Abdominal computed tomography scan and small bowel barium follow-through study were not of any help. GI bleeding and abdominal discomfort were resolved after the lesion was surgically removed. Pathologic examination demonstrated pancreatic acinar cells and a secretory duct in the ileal submucosa, consistent with ectopic pancreas. Ectopic pancreas in the small intestine may be a rare cause of obscure GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy seems to be a good, noninvasive tool for identification in the small bowel, particularly when other imaging modalities fail to detect any abnormalities. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

59149087013	Changing pattern of ectopic pancreas: 22 years of experience in a medical center	Background/Purpose: Ectopic pancreas is usually a silent gastrointestinal malformation. It may become clinically evident when complicated by chronic inflammation or by growth. More ileal ectopic pancreas has been found in recent years in our hospital. We report the clinical manifestation of ectopic pancreas over the past 22 years. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients seen between May 1984 and December 2005 at Mackay Memorial Hospital, with a diagnosis of ectopic pancreas, and extracted clinical and histopathology data from the records. Results: A total of 39 patients (18 male, 21 female; mean age, 46 years) were diagnosed with ectopic pancreas. Most patients were aged between 30 and 50 years. Only 15 (38%) had symptoms suggestive of ectopic pancreas. These included abdominal pain (n=9), upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n=5), and abdominal distension (n=2). The diagnosis in the other 24 patients was made incidentally, usually during surgery for other conditions. While lesions in the stomach were more likely to be diagnosed because of symptoms (12 of 13), lesions in the small bowel were almost always diagnosed incidentally. Only one of eight in the duodenum, one of 10 in the jejunum, and one of eight in the ileum, were isolated findings. One case of ectopic pancreas was detected by capsule endoscopy. Conclusion: Ectopic pancreas can be found in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The high proportion of ileal ectopic pancreas is unexpected and needs further study. ©2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

0034936619	Intestinal malrotation in adults-A case report	Most congenital anomalies of intestinal rotation occur in infancy and neonatal period. If no complications are observed in these periods, malrotation usually remains silent and is discovered incidentally. A 59-year-old male was admitted due to persisted abdominal pain with distension for 2 days. On admission, plain film of abdomen revealed intestinal obstruction. Abnormal position of duodenojejunal junction and undescended cecum were found by swallowed gastrointestinal barium studies. He received laparotomy later because of persistent intestinal obstruction with conservative treatment. Lysis of adhesion bands and elective appendectomy were performed. Post-operative course was smooth. He was well during the follow-up period. By clinical experience, the upper gastrointestinal barium study is a sensitive diagnostic tool for intestinal malrotation. The position of duodenojejunal junction and cecum are the critical landmarks in diagnosis of bowel malrotation. Surgery is indicated in symptomatic and complicated cases.

0034946469	Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma: Clinical experience and analysis of prognostic factors	Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant neoplasm in Taiwan. Ruptured HCC is a rare serious complication with the incidence varies from 0.35% to 14.5% and has high mortality. The aim of the present study is to analyze the prognostic factors and to evaluate the outcome of recent treatments strategy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and laboratory variables of fifty-four patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma to evaluate the outcomes of treatment and to correlate the prognostic factors between survival and fatal groups. Results: Acute abdominal pain and hypovolemic shock were the most common initial chief complaints. Of these 54 patients, 34 patients were treated by supportive measure, 9 by operation and 11 by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). Surgery and TAE were superior to supportive measure (p = < 0.012 and p = 0.000 respectively) but there was no statistical significance when comparing between surgery and TAE. Serum albumin level, serum total bilirubin level and presence of liver cirrhosis were correlated with prognosis of ruptured HCC between survival and fatal group. Conclusion: Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma is a serious complication with high mortility rate of 76%. Treatment regime, serum albumin and total bilirubin level and presence of liver cirrhosis will effect the prognosis of ruptured HCC.

4344600583	Clinical features of human intestinal capillariasis in Taiwan	Human intestinal capillariasis is a rare parasitosis that was first recognized in the Philippines in the 1960 s. Parasitosis is a life threatening disease and has been reported from Thailand, Japan, South of Taiwan (Kaoh-Siung), Korea, Iran, Egypt, Italy and Spain. Its clinical symptoms are characterized by chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, borborygmus, marked weight loss, protein and electrolyte loss and cachexia. Capillariasis may be fatal if early treatment is not given. We reported 14 cases living in rural areas of Taiwan. Three cases had histories of travelling to Thailand. They might have been infected in Thailand while stayed there. Two cases had the diet of raw freshwater fish before. Three cases received emergency laparotomy due to peritonitis and two cases were found of enteritis cystica profunda. According to the route of transmission, freshwater and brackish-water fish may act as the intermediate host of the parasite. The most simple and convenient method of diagnosing capillariasis is stool examination. Two cases were diagnosed by histology. Mebendazole or albendezole 200 mg orally twice a day for 20-30 d is the treatment of choice. All the patients were cured, and relapses were not observed within 12 mo.

42949154311	Gallstone ileus: A disease easily ignored in the elderly	Gallstone ileus is an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction, accounting for only 1-4% of all intestinal obstructions. In patients with cholelithiasis, only 0.3-0.5% reportedly develop gallstone ileus. However, the condition causes 25% of cases of non-strangulated small bowel obstruction in those over the age of 65 years. We report a patient with gallstone ileus who presented with small bowel obstruction that was initially misdiagnosed. The correct diagnosis was made based on finding an ectopic gallstone on plain abdominal radiography, a cholecystoduodenal fistula, and gallstone impaction in a small bowel follow-through study. © 2008 Elsevier.

45549105694	Simultaneous Klebsiella pneumoniae and amoebic liver abscess in an immunocompetent patient	Simultaneous Klebsiella pneumoniae and amoebic liver abscess is rarely reported in immunocompetent patients. A 47-year-old man was hospitalized with abdominal pain, fever, chills, and hypotension. Physical examination revealed right upper quadrant tenderness. Abdominal computed tomography showed an area of low attenuation with some liquefaction in the liver. Echo-guided aspiration revealed 30 mL of pus, which grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the same organism was isolated from the blood. Cytology examination of the pus showed scattered amoeba. The patient gradually improved over 1 month on treatment with cefmetazole and metronidazole, along with repeated drainage of the abscess. His amoebic indirect hemag- glutination titer was 1:128, but no parasite ova or amoeba were found in the stool. He had no evidence of immunocompromise. Parasitic diseases may be a predisposing factor for bacterial infections, including pyogenic liver abscess. The possible coexistence of amoebae and bacteria in a liver abscess should not be discounted.

52249103716	Acute emphysematous cholecystitis: A case report	Emphysematous cholecystitis is a relatively rare variant but rapidly progressive and life threatening form of acute cholecystitis caused by gas-producing organisms. In contrast to acute cholecystitis, emphysematous cholecystitis occurs more commonly in elderly and diabetic patients, and is frequently associated with perforation and death, requiring emergent surgical intervention. Because poor visualization of the gallbladder in abdominal sonogram, emphysematous cholecystitis is very difficult to diagnose in most of cases. Plain film or computed tomography, are more sensitive in detecting and characterizing the gas in the gallbladder. We present a 80-year-old man with no diabetes presented with right upper abdominal pain, but without typical symptoms of acute cholecystitis as fever, nausea, vomiting and Murphy's sign after admission. Emphysematous cholecystitis with gallbladder perforation was confirmed by computed tomography. Emergent cholecystectomy was performed immediately and Clostridium perfringens was isolated from the bile and blood culture. He had an uneventful post-operative recovery. Elderly patients who have emphysematous cholecystitis may present with only right upper abdominal pain. Other signs may be absent. Preoperative diagnosis can be difficult. When the gallbladder is poorly visualized and gas is suspected on ultrasonography, it should be defined by plain film and computed tomography and emergent cholecystectomy is needed to minimize the risk of mortality.

57049163584	Partial splenic embolization: 12-month hematological effects and complications	Background/Aims: To investigate the hematological effects and immediate postoperative complications of partial splenic embolization (PSE) in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methodology: Record of liver cirrhosis patients with thromhocytopenia, and leukopenia in whom PSE was performed between June 1995 and June 2005 were reviewed. Peripheral blood counts were evaluated at baseline, at 1 week, and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-PSE and clinically significant complications were recorded. Results: In the twenty patients who underwent PSE, significant improvements in thrombocyte and leukocyte levels were noted at all time points compared to baseline levels up to one year following PSE (P<0.01). The complication rate was 100% because all patients experienced fever and abdominal pain. Only 7 patients (35%) experienced additional, mild post-embolization complications, and only 2 (10%) experienced serious complications. The mortality rate in this study was 0%. Conclusions: PSE significantly improved thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. These results support the contention that PSE is effective and safe, and should be employed more widely in the management of thrombocytopenia in patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly higher-risk patients that may not be candidates for surgical splenectomy. Further studies evaluating risk factors, criteria for patient selection, and target embolization area are warranted. © H.G.E. Update Medical Publishing S.A., Athens-Stuttgart.

67749133680	Proposed Scoring System to Determine Small Bowel Mass Lesions Using Capsule Endoscopy	Background/Purpose: Capsule endoscopy is a highly sensitive method for the detection of small bowel lesions. False-positive findings are important confounding factors. This study reports on a scoring system for evaluating the role of capsule endoscopy in small bowel tumors. Methods: Ten men and two women (age, 23-79 years) with suspected small bowel tumors were included from 120 patients referred for capsule endoscopy between March 2004 and March 2008. The indications were gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 9), melanoma workup (n = 1), physical checkup (n = 1), and iron deficiency anemia (n = 1). The proposed tumor score was composed of five components: bleeding, mucosal disruption, an irregular surface, color, and white villi. These can be scored for probability of mass lesions seen at capsule endoscopy. Small bowel mass lesions were probably present in those with a score of ≥ 4, and a score of ≤ 2 indicated a low probability of a small bowel mass lesion. Results: Capsule endoscopy showed probable small bowel mass lesions in six patients, and a low lesion probability in the other six. Capsule endoscopy showed that new lesions were not detected by esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy. All six patients with probable small bowel tumors were found to have pathological findings upon capsule endoscopy: two with lymphangioma, and one each with ileal ectopic pancreas, with melanoma metastasis, gastrointestinal lymphoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Conclusion: Capsule endoscopy may detect small bowel tumors more reliably by using the scoring system outlined. It should be considered in suspected cases of small bowel tumor. © 2009 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

67749143913	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-related peptic ulcer	Except of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were prescribed in 25.6% patients in outpatient services in Taiwan. Peptic ulcer disease was found in 20% patients during taking NSAIDs, and 1-4% patients suffered from other complications, such as bleeding or perforation. Incidence of peptic ulcers decreased now but an increasing proportion is related to NSAID and the mortality is high. There are several drugs prescribing for treatment or prevention of NSAIDs-related ulcer. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, histamine H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors are prescribed for treatment of NSAIDs-related ulcer. In addition, prevention of NSAIDs-related ulcer must be in accordance with risk. Least ulcerogenic NSAIDs are prescribed for the patient without risk. In patient with risks, NSAIDs may be shifted to selective COX-2 inhibitors or combined with H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors according to the risks.

70349194487	Trends and patterns of perforated peptic ulcer	The aim of this study was to investigate the trends and clinical presentation of peptic ulcer perforation before and after the introduction of more effective ulcer therapy, including proton pump inhibitor and eradication of Helicobacter pylori. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients admitted to Mackay Memorial Hospital for perforated peptic ulcer from 1985-7 (Group 1) and 2000-2 (Group 2). 188 and 158 patients were included in group 1 and group 2, respectively. Mean age was 47.2±14.8 years in group 1 and 51.8± 14.4 years in group 2 (p=0.017). There was a two-fold increase in the incidence of elderly patients (>70 years) with ulcer perforation in the recent period (p=0.014). About 50% of patients in each group had a past history of peptic ulcer disease. The majority of patients (85.6% in group 1 and 80.3% in group 2) presented to the emergency room with acute abdominal pain. There was a significant increase in the proportion of perforated ulcers in the stomach in group 2 compared with group 1(p<0.005). In addition, there were no significant differences in the mortality between the two study periods. In conclusion, the proportion of elderly patients with perforated peptic ulcers in recent years has been increased. There has also been an increase in the ratio of gastric perforation compared with duodenal perforation.

70349413195	Predictive Model for Length of Hospital Stay of Patients Surviving Surgery for Perforated Peptic Ulcer	Background/Purpose: Many studies have assessed the major risk factors for mortality or morbidity in surgical patients with perforated peptic ulcer (PPU). The aim of our study was to focus on survivors and to investigate the predictive factors for length of hospital stay (LOHS) for surgical patients. Methods: The medical records of 195 patients who survived surgery were reviewed retrospectively. The following factors were analyzed: patient profile, associated medical illnesses, diagnostic methods, fever, preoperative shock, clinical data from the emergency room, delays in surgery, sites of perforation, operative methods, positive ascites culture and species of microorganism, postoperative infection, and non-infective postoperative complications. Results: Univariate analysis showed that the following factors were significantly related to longer LOHS: age > 65 years, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, history of peptic ulcer disease, number of comorbid diseases, preoperative shock, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL, surgical delay of > 12 hours, and all postoperative factors except species of microorganisms in ascites culture. In a multivariate linear regression model, catheter infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection, bacteremia, non-infective abdominal complications, other infections, surgical delay of > 12 hours, and comorbidity were major factors associated with longer LOHS. Conclusion: A predictive model was established with nine factors that explained 71.6% of the variation in LOHS of patients who survived surgery for PPU. Several corrective methods based on the model can be devised by attending physicians to shorten LOHS. © 2009 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

70350393514	Findings and risk factors of early mortality of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in different cohorts of elderly patients	OBJECTIVES: To analyze experience of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in patients with of different age cohorts and discuss the risk factors of early mortality after ERCP. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred sixty-four patients with pancreatobiliary diseases divided into cohorts according to decades as young-old (YO, 65-74, n=143), old-old (OO, 75-84, n=88), and very-old (VO, ≥85, n=33). MEASUREMENTS: The indications, results, and complications of ERCP in these three groups were demonstrated and compared. RESULTS: Three hundred three ERCP procedures were performed. The leading indication for ERCP was common bile duct (CBD) obstruction or dilation. Diabetes mellitus was significantly more prevalent in the YO group (39.2%) than in the other two groups (OO, 15.9%; VO, 24.2%; P=.001). The most common finding of ERCP was CBD dilatation. There was no difference in incidence of malignant diseases between the three groups. Acute pancreatitis was the most frequently identified post-ERCP complication. There was no significant difference in early mortality between the three cohorts. Patients with malignancy had higher early mortality than those with benign disease (71.4% vs 11.2%; P=.001). CONCLUSION: The findings and incidences of complication of ERCP in different elderly cohorts were similar. Underlying malignancy seemed to bear some relation to early mortality after the ERCP procedure. © 2009, The American Geriatrics Society.

0034753755	Castleman's disease - A case report	A twenty-six years old female was healthy before and had no any past history. She came to our hospital due to intermittent upper abdominal pain and fullness for a period of time. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hypoechoic lesion about 5 cm in size located at pancreatic head region. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangio-Pancreatography study was negative. Abdominal CT revealed a huge peritoneal tumor with several scattered small calcifications. Laboratory data showed anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypergammaglobulinemia and elevated ESR. Laparotomy found a huge retroperitoneal tumor and excision was performed. Pathologic finding was one lymphoid tissue with follicular hyperplasia, interfollicular infiltration of plasma cells, follicles contain acidophilic material and prominent vascular proliferation. And Castleman's disease was diagnosed. After excision of tumor, the patient was well and abnormal laboratory datas returned to normal range. The patient was followed up regularly at our OPD and had no evidence of recurrence.

77952437110	Comparison of coplanar and noncoplanar intensity-modulated radiation therapy and helical tomotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: To compare the differences in dose-volume data among coplanar intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), noncoplanar IMRT, and helical tomotherapy (HT) among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT).Methods: Nine patients with unresectable HCC and PVT underwent step and shoot coplanar IMRT with intent to deliver 46 - 54 Gy to the tumor and portal vein. The volume of liver received 30Gy was set to keep less than 30% of whole normal liver (V30 < 30%). The mean dose to at least one side of kidney was kept below 23 Gy, and 50 Gy as for stomach. The maximum dose was kept below 47 Gy for spinal cord. Several parameters including mean hepatic dose, percent volume of normal liver with radiation dose at X Gy (Vx), uniformity index, conformal index, and doses to organs at risk were evaluated from the dose-volume histogram.Results: HT provided better uniformity for the planning-target volume dose coverage than both IMRT techniques. The noncoplanar IMRT technique reduces the V10 to normal liver with a statistically significant level as compared to HT. The constraints for the liver in the V30 for coplanar IMRT vs. noncoplanar IMRT vs. HT could be reconsidered as 21% vs. 17% vs. 17%, respectively. When delivering 50 Gy and 60-66 Gy to the tumor bed, the constraints of mean dose to the normal liver could be less than 20 Gy and 25 Gy, respectively.Conclusion: Noncoplanar IMRT and HT are potential techniques of radiation therapy for HCC patients with PVT. Constraints for the liver in IMRT and HT could be stricter than for 3DCRT. © 2010 Hsieh et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77956034597	Perforated peptic ulcer in southeastern Taiwan	Background: No studies focus on the population with perforated peptic ulcer in southeastern Taiwan. The present study aimed to assess the differences between the different races and the risk factors related to mortality and morbidity in postoperative patients in southeastern Taiwan. Methods: The medical records of 237 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The following factors were analyzed: patient profiles, coexisting illnesses, diagnostic method, fever, preoperative shock, clinical data at emergency room, delay operation, site of perforation, operative method, positive ascites culture, species of microbes in ascites culture, postoperative complications, death and the length of hospital stay. Results: Aborigines were significantly different from non-aborigines in the ratio of female cases and in the habits of alcohol drinking and betel nut chewing. There were also four significantly different variables between them: fever, hemoglobin value, site of perforation and operative method. Total postoperative complication rate was 41.3% and 39 patients (16.6%) died. In multivariate analysis, age ≧ 65 years, lipase > upper normal limit and preoperative shock were independent predictors of mortality. Significant risk factors associated with morbidity were NSAIDs use, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and preoperative shock. Conclusion: Aborigines were different from non-aborigines in several categories. In southeastern Taiwan, NSAIDs use, creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL and preoperative shock were independent risk factors of morbidity, and age ≧ 65 years, lipase > upper normal limit and preoperative shock were independent risk factors of mortality in postoperative perforated peptic ulcer. Lipase > upper normal limit is needed for further research on the influence on mortality. © 2010 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

0035706855	Recurrent bleeding from gastric angiodysplasia: A case report	A giant angiodysplasia causing recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding was found in a 51-year-old woman who had been treated with repeated blood transfusions for severe anemia. At first, no active bleeding source was seen on upper or lower GI endoscopy. The only abnormality found on gastroendoscopy was an irregular, flat, reddish mucosal lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum, which was mistaken for superficial gastritis. Subsequent endoscopic examinations were done because of intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding and revealed a 4×6 cm, irregular, mildy elevated, bright-red vascular lesion on the posterior wall of the antrum. This giant lesion had spontaneous oozing of fresh blood and was suspected to be a gastric angiodysplasia. An upper abdominal CT scan showed relative thickening of the antral wall. Because of the difficulty of treating such a large posterior antral lesion endoscopically, the patient underwent a subtotal gastrectomy. Pathologic examination revealed gastric angiodysplasia. The postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no recurrent bleeding. We present this case to remind clinicians of the importance of repeated endoscopic examinations in cases of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, especially when active bleeding is occurring.

0035717273	Clinical features of human intestinal capillariasis in Tai-tung	Human intestinal capillariasis is a rare parasitosis that was first recognized in the Philippines in the 1960s. The parasitosis is a life threatening disease and has been reported from Thailand, Japan, South of Taiwan (Kaoh-Siung), Korea, Iran, Egypt, Italy and Spain. Clinical symptoms are characterized by chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, borborygmi, marked weight loss, protein and electrolyte loss and cachexia. Capillariasis may be fatal if treatment is not given early. We reported 7 cases living in rural areas of Taiwan. They had no history of travelling abroad. Two cases had the diet of raw freshwater fish before. Two cases received emergency laparotomy due to peritonitis and found of enteritis cystica profunda. According to the route of transmission, freshwater and brackish-water fish may act as the intermediate host of the parasite. The most simple and convenient method of diagnosing capillariasis is stool examination. Two cases were diagnosed by histology. Mebendazole or albendazole 200mg orally twice a day for 20-30 days as the treatment of choice. All the patients were cured, and relapses were not observed within 12 months.

0035718748	Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of vater -A 10-year experience	Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of vater is a rare disease, but the increase in incidence is seen in recent 10 years. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater from 1991 to 2000 December. A total of 55 adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater were recorded- 25 men and 30 women, mean age 62.21 ± 3.7 (range 38-89) years. The most frequent clinical signs were jaundice (n = 49, 84.5%). Two (3.4%) healthy patients without any clinical symptoms/signs presented with abnormal liver function test. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 45 patients. Five patients (11.1%) died during the postoperative period. The crude survival rates after pancreaticoduodenectomy were 81.6% at 1 year, 48.6% at 2 year, 22.2% at 4 year and 19.2% at 5 year. Postoperative survival analysis revealed that 5-year survival was significantly good when ulcer formation in appearance and early stage(stage I) were found. Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of vater is a rare disease, but the increase in incidence is seen in recent 10 years. One of the probable causes of rising incidence was the improvement in diagnosis. Predominance of numbers of women in our study was different to previous studies. Lymph node involvement and invasion to pancreas were not poor prognostic factors. Only ulcer formation and the stage of tumor were significant prognostic factors in our study when chi-squar tests were used to test for 5-year survival. This may be due to difference in races and geographic distribution, so further studies are needed. Abnormal liver function test and unknown causes of CBD dilatation found by abdominal sonography may need further ERCP examination.

In Taiwan, most of HIV infections were young adult. Therefore, is there a relationship between the HIV infection and hepatic abscess? From July 1990 to June 2001, we recorded the patients with liver abscess that were between 20 and 35 year-old, and analyzed their history and clinical data, method of treatment, and more emphasized the result of HIV test. There were 66 patients enrolled in this study, about 10.6% of all liver abscess cases in our hospital. Ratio of man and woman was 2.47:1. 12% patients had diabetes; biliary tract disorder and hematological disease were 9% respectively, 3 patients had cancer. 6 cases were associated with trauma, cirrhosis or congenital heard disease. 39 patients didn't have specific history. Fever, chill and right upper abdominal pain were the most initial symptoms. 60 cases were pyogenic abscess and 6 cases were amoebic abscess. Most of abscesses were single and 85% located in the right lobe liver. Positive culture of blood and pus were 19% and 64%, Klebsiella pneumoniae was 42%. In treatment, 17% patients used antibiotics only, 14% with echoguide aspiration, half of cases received drainage by CT guide, and another 19% received surgical drainage or resection. 5 patients died with association of liver abscess. 19 of 66 patients had checked HIV antibody. Although only three patients were positive, it is about 15.8% of tested cased and 4.5% of this study. The three patients were in the early stage of HIV infection. Predisposed factor of liver abscess in young adult is different from old age; most of them had not specific systemic disease. About 9% of them were amoebic abscess, higher than general population in Taiwan. Although the positive rate of bacterial culture was slightly low, Klebsiella pneumonae still was the most common cause. However, there were more than 4.5% patients with HIV infection and without flare out of AIDS. HIV test should be done if young adult got liver abscess.

79960556188	Ameboma mimicking submucosal tumor of the colon in an elderly	Ameboma is a rare presentation of intestinal amebiasis, which is caused by infection with Entamoeba histolytica. Amebomas are generally concentric and can be difficult to differentiate from carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract, which are commonly seen in elderly patients. Radiological studies or colonoscopy can be difficult to provide the diagnosis. We present an elderly man with an ameboma in the ascending colon, which manifested as a submucosal tumor in the radiological or endoscopic studies. His serum antiamebic serology test was positive. He received surgery because of poor response to medical treatment. A full course of antiamebic therapy followed by a luminal agent were given and he had a smooth postoperative course without relapse of amebic infection. Although the elderly population has a higher incidence of colonic malignancy, ameboma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors in the colon, especially in patients with an insidious onset of disease. © 2011, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

84861045277	Recurrent cholangitis after endoscopic lithotripsy of common bile duct stones with gallstones in situ: Predictive factors with and without subsequent cholecystectomy	Background: Common bile duct stones are a frequent complication of gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and sphincterotomy are often performed to evaluate the etiology of obstructive jaundice and for concomitant therapeutic removal of common bile duct stones. We aimed to evaluate the recurrence rate of cholangitis or cholecystitis after endoscopic lithotripsy with gallstones in situ and to identify associated predictive factors. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 183 patients who had received endoscopic lithotripsy between July 2007 and June 2010. We divided patients into two groups: One group who had received subsequent cholecystectomy (n=66) and one observational group (n=117). Patients with previous cholecystectomy or without gallstones were excluded. All included patients were followed up at our outpatient department. Our end point was the presence of symptoms of recurrent cholangitis or cholecystitis. Results: Subjects included 86 males and 97 females with a mean age of 62.5±16.3 years (range, 43-81 years). Cholangitis or cholecystitis recurred in 6 patients in the cholecystectomy group and 30 patients in the observational group. Findings revealed a lower recurrence rate and longer recurrence-free period in patients who received subsequent cholecystectomy. The recurrence rate of the observational group was significantly higher than that of the cholecystectomy group (25.6% versus 9.1%, P=.007). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that common bile duct dilatation was an independent predictive factor for recurrence. Conclusions: Cholecystectomy is recommended after endoscopic lithotripsy. Common bile duct dilatation is associated with the rate of recurrent cholangitis or cholecystitis. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

0036816348	Increased risk for hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis in relatives of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in northern Taiwan	Background. There is a tendency for familial aggregation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aims of this study were to assess the degree to which familial aggregation of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers accounts for familiality of HCC in families of hepatitis B-related HCC patients, and whether HCC shares a familial predisposition with liver cirrhosis among HBsAg carriers. Methods. A total of 671 first-degree relatives of HBsAg-positive HCC cases were recruited using abdominal ultrasonography and tests for HBsAg and serum aminotransferases. They were from 165 simplex families defined as having only one HCC case and 72 multiplex families with more than one case. In analyses of family history of HCC and cirrhosis, the data set consisted of 4471 unrelated asymptomatic HBsAg carriers recruited in a prospective study. Results. There was no significant difference in the HBsAg-positive rate among relatives between multiplex (55.7%) and simplex (48.1%) families. Sonographic evidence of liver cirrhosis was present in 14.4% of HBsAg-positive relatives from multiplex families but in only 7.8% of HBsAg-positive relatives from simplex families (multiplex versus simplex families: adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.29; 95% CI: 1.10-4.77). Among unrelated asymptomatic HBsAg carriers, the adjusted OR of liver cirrhosis associated with a first-degree family history of HCC was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.68-4.66). This association was stronger in HBsAg carriers < 50 years. No association was seen between family history of HCC and hepatitis activity based on elevated levels of aminotransferases. Conclusions. Familial aggregation of HCC in HBsAg carriers is associated with familial clustering of liver cirrhosis.

0037347990	Decision making in right-sided diverticulitis	Aim: To evaluate systematically our nine-year experience in treating right-sided diverticulitis of the colon, and to explore its clinical and radiological relationship. Methods: The clinical and radiological data of 40 patients with colonic diverticulitis treated in Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, from 1993 through 2002 were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The average age of the patients with right-sided diverticulitis was 53.1 years/which was 11.6 years younger than that of the patients with left-sided diverticulitis. The preoperative diagnosis of appendicitis was made in 8 of 13 right-sided diverticulitis patients. Nine (69 %) had right lower quadrant abdominal pain for more than 48 hours, and ten patients (77 %) presented with fever. CT findings suggesting acute right-sided diverticulitis including thickening of the intestinal wall and pericolonic inflammation were present in five patients. Conclusion: Right-sided diverticulitis is easily confused with acute appendicitis because it occurs at a somewhat younger age than that in left-sided diverticulitis. Barium enema and CT are helpful for the early diagnosis of right-sided diverticulitis. While clearly not required in the majority of patients with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, barium enema and CT may be helpful in making the decision with a clinical history or physical examinations atypical of acute appendicitis.

0037347992	Concomitant hepatocellular adenoma and adenomatous hyperplasia in a patient without cirrhosis	Aim: Hepatocelluar adenoma (HCA) and adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) are rare benign tumors of the liver. HCA is usually found in women who use oral contraceptives. AH usually occurs in patients with liver cirrhosis. Both tumors have potential for malignant transformation. Methods: We described a male adult with chronic liver disease (CLD) who had been known to be a hepatitis B carrier (HBV) for years. He was found to have a space-occupying lesion with a suspicion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by abdominal ultrasonography. His α-fetoprotein (AFP) was normal. Angiographic findings were consistent with the diagnosis of HCC, he wished to avoid an operation, was treated with transcatheter hepatic arterial embolization. Results: He subsequently consented to surgery, and a right lobectomy was performed. The liver pathology disclosed HCA with nuclear dysplasia and post-embolization effects. In addition, there were multiple small foci of AH with nuclear dysplasia in the resected liver. Although he had some focal areas of cirrhosis-like change or post-embolization effect, the AH was associated only with normal liver tissue. Conclusion: This case confirms that HCA and AH may resemble HCC on imaging studies, and that AH may occur in CLD in the absence of cirrhotic change.

0037351396	Adhesive small bowel obstruction: How long can patients tolerate conservative treatment?	Aim: To evaluate how long patients with small bowel obstruction caused by postoperative adhesions can tolerate conservative treatment. Methods: The records of patients with small bowel obstruction due to postoperative adhesions were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included the number of admissions, type of management for each admission, duration of conservative treatment, number of repeat laparotomies, and operative findings. Results: One hundred fifty-five patients with this condition from January 1999 to December 2001, for a total of 293 admissions were enrolled in this study. Medical treatment alone was given in 220 admissions, and repeat laparotomy was performed in 73 admissions. The period of observation in patients managed medically ranged from 2 to 12 days (average: 6.9 days), while for those who underwent surgery, the range was 1 to 14 days (average 5.4 days). At surgery, adhesions were the only finding in 46 cases, while there were intestinal complications in 27, or 9.2 % of all 293 admissions. Fever and leukocytosis greater than 15 000/mm

0036942113	Chloangiocarcinoma in pregnancy - A case report	A thirty-five years old female was healthy before and had no any past history. She felt epigastric pain & poor appetite on 12 th week of pregnancy and she developed generalized jaundice on 23th week of pregnancy. She came to our hospital for further treatment. Abdominal ultrasound showed a hyperechoic lesion about 6cm in size located at right lobe of liver nearthe hilum with dilatation of common bile duct and bilateral hepatic ducts. Abdominal MRI also showed the same lesion at the similar site. So we arranged percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy for the patient. Pathologic finding was a primary cholangiocarcinoma. The patient delivered a male baby by cesarean section on 32th week of pregnancy. She received palliative treatment(radiotherapy and chemotherapy) after C/S. The patient was followed up regularly at our OPD and jaundice, epigastric pain with metastatic liver tumor were still noted. The male baby was healthy after birth.We also discuss the difficulty in diagnosis, treatment and poor prognosis in pregnancy with cholangiocarcinoma.-a rare case in the literature.

0038447245	Toxic megacolon in shigellosis and inflammatory bowel disease	Toxic dilatation of the colon may be due to inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease of the colon. However, recent experience has shown that infective colitis due to shigellosis can also produce this complication. We present five cases with toxic megacolon (four inflammatory bowel disease and one shigellosis) and outline the clinical features and treatment of these patients. It is important to distinguish shigellosis from other infectious aetiologies at an early stage because treatment with corticosteroids can cause serious, potentially fatal complications. In cases resulting from infections, where the causative agent is identified early and therapy produces an improvement in the patient's condition, then the condition will often respond to medical management alone.

0038052657	Transcatheter arterial embolization treatment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and risk of pulmonary metastasis	Aim: To investigate the relationship between transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) and pulmonary metastasis in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 287 patients with HCC followed up for more than 1 week were included. 102 patients underwent transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE group) and 185 received conservative treatment (control group). The patients' chest x-rays and chest CT scans were examined for pulmonary metastasis. Results: Patients with TAE had a median survival of 19.3 months while that of the control group was only 10.0 months (P<0.05). Pulmonary metastasis occurred in 14 (13.7 %) patients in the TAE group and 14 (7.6 %) patients in the control group, there was no significant difference (P>0.05). The 1-year, 2-year and 5-year cumulative incidence of pulmonary metastasis was 11.8 %, 17.6 % and 24.0 % in the TAE group and 7.0 %, 13.0 % and 21.7 % in the control group, respectively (P>0.05). On the univariate analysis, tumor size, abnormal serum alanine aminotransferase levels and heterogeneity on sonography were significantly associated with pulmonary metastasis. However, on the multivariate analysis, only tumor size was significantly predictive of pulmonary metastasis. Conclusion: TAE is effective on prolonging survival of patients with HCC. It does not significantly increase the risk of pulmonary metastasis. Tumor size is the only significant predictive factor associated with lung metastasis.

84870929832	Gastric variceal bleeding in the elderly	Background: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding of all causes has a higher morbidity and mortality in older patients compared with younger patients. We retrospectively studied gastric variceal bleeding in older patients and compared the complications and outcomes of endoscopic variceal obliteration with younger patients. Methods: From August 2002 to August 2010, a total of 76 patients with gastric variceal bleeding who had received endoscopic variceal obliteration using Histoacryl as an adhesive agent by a single endoscopist were studied. Their chart records were obtained and reviewed with data collection. Patient demographics, laboratory parameters, etiology of liver cirrhosis, Child-Pugh classification, endoscopic findings, complications after endoscopic treatment, and mortality were gathered and analyzed. Results: A total of 26 (34.2%) of the 76 patients were older than 64 years. There were patients who were younger than 64 years who had more variceal bleeding as compared with the older patients. In older patient groups, women were more likely to have gastric variceal bleeding than their male counterparts. The most common type of gastric varices was gastroesophageal varices type 2 (GOV2). Significant difference existed in the etiology of cirrhosis between the two groups, with more hepatitis B and alcoholic hepatitis in the younger patients and more hepatitis C in the older patients. Significantly more Child-Pugh classification B and C cases were noticed in the younger patients. There were no significant differences of mortality and complications after treatment, including recurrent bleeding and sepsis, between the older and younger patients. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in outcomes after endoscopic treatment between the younger and the older patient groups. Endoscopic variceal obliteration using Histoacryl as an adhesive agent could be applied to treat older patients with gastric variceal bleeding just as it is for younger patients.

84874488615	Clinicopathological Correlation and Prognostic Significance of Protein Kinase Cα Overexpression in Human Gastric Carcinoma	Objectives: This study investigated the PKCα protein expression in gastric carcinoma, and correlated it with clinicopathological parameters. The prognostic significance of PKCα protein expression in gastric carcinoma was analyzed. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR test was applied to compare the PKCα mRNA expression in tumorous and nontumorous tissues of gastric carcinoma in ten randomly selected cases. Then PKCα protein expression was evaluated in 215 cases of gastric carcinoma using immunohistochemical method. The immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively as: 0 = absent; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; and 3 = strong. All cases were further classified into two groups, namely PKCα overexpression group with score 2 or 3, and non-overexpression group with score 0 or 1. The PKCα protein expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed to determine the prognostic significance of PKCα protein expression in patients with gastric carcinoma. Results: PKCα mRNA expression was upregulated in all ten cases of gastric carcinoma via quantitative real-time PCR test. In immunohistochemical study, eighty-eight out of 215 cases (41%) of gastric carcinoma revealed PKCα protein overexpression, which was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.0073), histologic type (P<0.0001), tumor differentiation (P = 0.0110), depth of invasion (P = 0.0003), angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.0373), pathologic stage (P = 0.0047), and distant metastasis (P = 0.0048). We found no significant difference in overall and disease free survival rates between PKCα overexpression and non-overexpression groups (P = 0.0680 and 0.0587). However, PKCα protein overexpression emerged as a significant independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.632, P = 0.0415). Conclusions: PKCα protein is upregulated in gastric carcinoma. PKCα protein expression is statistically correlated with age, histologic type, tumor differentiation, depth of invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, pathologic stage, and distant metastasis. The PKCα protein overexpression in patients with gastric carcinoma is a significant independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis. © 2013 Lin et al.

84875256092	Ischemic colitis in an elderly patient	Acute abdomen pain refers to a sudden severe abdomen pain that is less than 24 hours in duration and can be caused by ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis is an ischemic injury to the colon. Most patients affected are elderly with non-specific symptoms and are easily overlooked. We present a case of an elderly female patient with ischemic colitis, who was initially misdiagnosed. An 83-year-old woman had a history of uremia with dialysis, peripheral arterial occlusive disease, atrial fibrillation without medical control, and rectal cancer (post operation of partial proctectomy with right nephrectomy). She visited our emergency room because of acute abdominal pain including bloodied stool passage lasting for one day. Physical examination of the abdomen showed diffuse tenderness. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis, hyperamylasemia, and poor renal function. Abdominal computed tomography showed mural thickening with peri-focal stranding in the exhausted descending and sigmoid colon. Ischemic colitis was suspected, but the surgeon hesitated to initiate surgery due to non-specific symptoms. Finally, colonoscopy demonstrated segmental edematous, fragile mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations from the rectum to the splenic flexure of the colon. Ischemic colitis of the descending colon, sigmoid colon and upper rectum was proved after surgery. The patient's condition improved after prompt surgery.

84878016689	Clinical characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma in elderly patients	SummaryBackground The average age of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been increasing worldwide. This study aimed to clarify the aged-specific clinical characteristics of HCC among elderly patients. Materials and methods We retrospectively analyzed 1123 patients with HCC treated between 2003 and 2006 at the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Patients aged more than 75 years of age at the time of diagnosis of HCC were defined as the elderly group. According to the Kaplan-Meier method, survival curves were compared between patients receiving treatment and those receiving supportive care. Results A total of 169 patients (16.9%) were included in the elderly group. The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 80 ± 3.6 years. The sex ratio (male to female) was 1:0.72. The proportion of patients positive for hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were 49.1% and 19.5%, respectively. The percentages of patients in the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score categories 0-1, 2-3, and 4-6 were 44%, 39%, and 17 %, respectively. Of the 169 patients, 114 patients (67.5%) underwent treatment - transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE, n = 52, 45.7%), being the predominant treatment method - while 55 patients (32.5%) received supportive care. There cumulative survival curves of the treated group and the supportive care group differed significantly for HCC patients in the CLIP score categories 0-1 (p < 0.001) and 2-3 (p = 0.021), while there was no difference in these survival curves for HCC patients in the CLIP score category 4-6. Conclusion Most elderly patients at the time of diagnosis of HCC were in CLIP score category 0-1. Transcatheter arterial embolization was the predominant treatment method at our hospital. Aggressive treatment for HCC, especially in CLIP score category 0-3, might improve the survival rate. Copyright © 2013, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

We report here, a 52 year-old male patient with left face mass for half year. He also complained of abdominal pain, then visited our hospital for help. Peptic ulcers, liver cirrhosis and suspected hepatocellular carcinoma were found after abdominal echo and panendoscopy. We confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of left parotid gland and soft tissue after parotidectomy. Though he had taken H2-blocker, gastrointestinal upset was persisted. Rectal cancer with obstruction was detected subsequently after barium enema. However, stool occult blood was negative and no anemia was disclosed. There were abdominal carcinomatosis with large amount of ascites during operation. Rectal adenocarcinoma was proved by pathology. He died later under hospice care. Colorectal cancer with parotid metastasis is rare and usually with poor prognosis. The patient ordinarily presented with parotid symptoms at first, and with few initial gastrointestinal signs.

0242332691	Sonographic evaluation of the effect of treating hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal stromal tumor: A case report	Metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis. In recent years, the relationship between GISTs and activation of the cell surface transmembrane receptor KIT has been well established. Imatinib mesylate inhibits the KIT signal transduction pathway, yielding a good response in half of patients with metastatic or unresectable GISTs. We report a patient with GIST hepatic metastases treated with imatinib mesylate. Cystic changes in the metastatic tumors were found on both computed tomography (CT) and sonography. While both CT scan and sonography showed changes in response to treatment, sonography demonstrated some features that CT did not, such as the change in wall thickness, mural nodules, and fluid-fluid levels. However, CT scan after contrast showed tumor viability and provided an overview of the lesions that sonography did not. We discuss the sonographic features of GISTs treated with imatinib mesylate and compare the findings with CT scan.

Subsequent electrophoresis showed that creatine kinase MM (CK-MM) accounted for 100% of the total CK activity. Eventually, the patient was diagnosed with prostatic: adenocarcinoma (stage D). His elevated CK-MB was most likely due to the presence of macro CK. It is important to be aware of different causes of CK isoenzyme elevation. When the patient's condition is not compatible with myocardial infarction, malignancy must be considered.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 91 cases with a previous diagnosis of GI stromal tumor, leiomyoma, or leiomyosarcoma. Tissue samples were assessed with CD117, CD34, SMA and S100 immunohistochemical staining. Clinical and pathological characteristics were analyzed for prognostic factors. Results: CD117 was positive in 81 (89 %) of 91 tissue samples. There were 59 cases (72.8 %) positive for CD34, 13 (16 %) positive for SMA, and 12 (14.8 %) positive for S100. There was no gender difference in patients with CD117-positive GIST. Their mean age was 65 years. There were 44 (54 %) tumors located in the stomach and 29 (36 %) in the small intestine. The most frequent presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and GI bleeding. The mean tumor size was 7.5±5.7 cm. There were 35 cases (43.2 %) with tumors >5 cm. The tumor size correlated significantly with tumor mitotic count and resectability. Tumor size, mitotic count, and resectability correlated significantly with tumor recurrence and survival. There was recurrent disease in 39 % of our patients, and their mean survival after recurrence was 16.6 months. Most recurrences were at the primary site or metastatic to the liver. Twenty-six percent of our patients died of their disease. Conclusion: Traditional histologic criteria are not specific enough to diagnose GIST. This diagnosis must be confirmed with CD117 immunohistochemical staining. Prognosis is dependent on tumor size, mitotic count, and resectability.

84890799258	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Prevalence, influence on age and sex, and relationship with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance	Background/purpose Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common condition comprising a wide spectrum of liver damage strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. The pathogenesis of fatty liver is multifactorial, and it has been suggested that the presence of insulin resistance (IR) is an essential requirement for the accumulation of hepatocellular fat. Although NAFLD may affect people of any age, in general, increasing age is associated with increasing prevalence. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of fatty liver and its influence on age and sex; and to assess the association of different degrees of fatty liver to IR and metabolic syndrome. Materials and methods The study was performed in 8350 alcohol- and virus-negative individuals who underwent routine physical check-up at the health evaluation centre of Mackay Memorial Hospital, from February 2004 to May 2009. They underwent clinical examination, anthropometry, biochemical tests including serum fasting insulin, and routine liver ultrasonography. Steatosis was graded as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. Results The overall prevalence of fatty liver was 34.40% with the prevalence of fatty liver being significantly higher in males than in females (22.34 vs. 12.06%, p = 0.015). A progressive increase in the means of a homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), body mass index, systolic blood pressure, plasma triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and glucose level and decrease in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05) was observed from the group without steatosis to the groups with mild, moderate, and severe steatosis. Severe steatosis was associated with the clustering of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. Individuals with metabolic syndrome and a more pronounced HOMA-IR had a higher prevalence of moderate to severe steatosis (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05) compared to those with HOMA-IR below the median. Conclusion Fatty liver can be considered as the hepatic consequence of metabolic syndrome, specifically IR. There is a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver among the elderly population. Metabolic disorders are closely related to fatty liver; moreover, fatty liver appears to be a good predictor for the clustering of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. © 2013, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency and Critical Care Medicine.

84904915606	Clinical presentations of patients from different age cohorts with biliary tract stone diseases	Background and Aim: The role of clinical symptoms, transabdominal ultrasound scan (USS), and liver function tests (LFTs) in evaluating common bile duct (CBD) stones in patients suspected to have pancreatobiliary disease has been studied. However, it is unclear whether these predictive models are useful in different age cohorts. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical presentations from different age cohorts with and without CBD stones. Methods: Four hundred and forty-three patients with pancreatobiliary diseases were divided into cohorts according to decades as follows: young (Y, 18-64 years old, n=143), young-old (YO, 65-74 years old, n=168), old-old (OO, 75-84 years old, n=97), and very old (VO, ≥85 years old, n=35). The clinical symptoms, LFTs, and USS findings were demonstrated and compared among patients. Results: Y- and YO-group patients were more likely to develop symptoms such as biliary colic in the presence of CBD stones. The proportion of abnormal serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were significantly greater in Y-, YO-, and OO-group patients with than in those without CBD stones. Sensitivity of USS for CBD stones in Y: 0.15; YO: 0.45; OO: 0.57; and VO: 0.68. Accuracy of USS for detected CBD stone in Y: 48%; YO: 62.5%; OO: 70.1%; and VO: 71.4%. Conclusion: Combined evaluation of clinical symptoms, biochemical and USS findings may help predict the presence of CBD stones. In Y, YO, and OO patients with CBD stones, the incidences of abnormal LFTs were higher. The sensitivity and accuracy of USS in detecting CBD stones were increased according to age. © 2014 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

Methods: The medical records of patients hospitalized from Januaryl997 to December 2002 with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis were retrospectively reviewed to find those with AAC, confirmed at operation or by histologic examination. Data collected included age, sex, white blood cell count, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, bacteriology, mortality, and sonographic findings. The sonographic findings were recorded on a 3-point scale with 1 point each for gallbladder distention, gallbladder wall thickness >3.5 mm, and sludge. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the presence (group A) or absence (group B) of severe gallbladder complications, defined as perforation, gangrene, or abscess. Results: There were 52 cases of AAC, accounting for 3.7 % of all cases of acute cholecystitis. Males predominated. Most patients were diagnosed by ultrasonography (48 of 52) or computed tomography (17 of 52). Severe gallbladder complications were present in 27 patients (52 %, group A) and absent in 25 (group B). Six patients died with a mortality of 12 %. Four of the 6 who died were in group A. Patients in group A were significantly older than those in group B (mean 60.88 y vs. 54.12 y, P=0.04) and had a significantly higher white blood cell count (mean 15 885.19 vs. 9 948.40, P=0.0005). All the 6 patients who died had normal white blood cell counts with an elevated percentage of band forms. The most commonly cultured bacteria in both blood and bile were E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The cumulative sonographic points did not reliably distinguish between groups A and B, even though group A tended to have more points. Conclusion: Older patients with a high white cell count are more likely to have severe gallbladder complications. In these patients, earlier surgical intervention should be considered if the sonographic findings support the diagnosis of AAC.
