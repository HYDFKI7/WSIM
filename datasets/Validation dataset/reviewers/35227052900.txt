33744744086	Search for excited muons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the results of a search for the production of an excited state of the muon, μ*, in proton antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV. The data have been collected with the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 380pb-1. We search for μ* in the process pp̄→μ*μ, with the μ* subsequently decaying to a muon plus photon. No excess above the standard model expectation is observed in data. Interpreting our data in the context of a model that describes μ* production by four-fermion contact interactions and μ* decay via electroweak processes, we set a 95% confidence level production cross section upper limit ranging from 0.057 to 0.112 pb, depending on the mass of the excited muon. Choosing the scale for contact interactions to be Λ=1TeV, excited muon masses below 618 GeV are excluded. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

We analyzed 0.38fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected between April 2002 and August 2004 with the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider.

In the framework of minimal supergravity, we set limits on the coupling parameter, extending significantly previous results obtained in Run I of the Tevatron and at the CERN LEP collider. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 325pb-1, were collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. Since no excess compared to the expectation from standard model processes is found, limits on the production cross section times branching ratio are set.

33749069884	Direct limits on the Bs0 oscillation frequency	We report results of a study of the Bs0 oscillation frequency using a large sample of Bs0 semileptonic decays corresponding to approximately 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider in 2002-2006. The amplitude method gives a lower limit on the Bs0 oscillation frequency at 14.8ps-1 at the 95% C.L. At Δms=19ps-1, the amplitude deviates from the hypothesis A=0 (1) by 2.5 (1.6) standard deviations, corresponding to a two-sided C.L. of 1% (10%). A likelihood scan over the oscillation frequency, Δms, gives a most probable value of 19ps-1 and a range of 17<Δms<21ps-1 at the 90% C.L., assuming Gaussian uncertainties. This is the first direct two-sided bound measured by a single experiment. If Δms lies above 22ps-1, then the probability that it would produce a likelihood minimum similar to the one observed in the interval 16-22ps-1 is (5.0±0.3)%. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

We study events with missing transverse energy and two acoplanar b jets, which provide sensitivity to the ZH production cross section in the νν̄bb̄ channel, and to WH production when the lepton from the W→ ν decay is undetected.

No indication for such a resonance was found in a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 370pb-1.

33845529162	Measurement of Bd mixing using opposite-side flavor tagging	We report on a measurement of the Bd0 mixing frequency and the calibration of an opposite-side flavor tagger in the D0 experiment. Various properties associated with the b quark on the opposite side of the reconstructed B meson are combined using a likelihood-ratio method into a single variable with enhanced tagging power. Its performance is tested with data, using a large sample of reconstructed semileptonic B→μD0X and B→μD*X decays, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1fb-1. The events are divided into groups depending on the value of the combined tagging variable, and an independent analysis is performed in each group. Combining the results of these analyses, the overall effective tagging power is found to be εD2=(2.48±0.21-0.06+0.08)%.

33751535218	Measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets final state with the matrix element method	We present a measurement of the top quark mass with the matrix element method in the lepton+jets final state. As the energy scale for calorimeter jets represents the dominant source of systematic uncertainty, the matrix element likelihood is extended by an additional parameter, which is defined as a global multiplicative factor applied to the standard energy scale. The top quark mass is obtained from a fit that yields the combined statistical and systematic jet energy scale uncertainty. Using a data set of 0.4fb-1 taken with the D0 experiment at Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, the mass of the top quark is measured using topological information to be: mtopℓ+jets(topo)=169. 2-7.4+5.0(stat+JES)-1.4+1.5(syst)GeV, and when information about identified b jets is included: mtopℓ+jets(b-tag)=170.3-4.5+4.1(stat+JES)-1.8+1.2(syst) GeV.

33750986190	Measurement of the CP-violation parameter of B0 mixing and decay with pp̄→μμX data	We measure the dimuon charge asymmetry A in pp̄ collisions at a center of mass energy s=1960GeV. The data was recorded with the D0 detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1.0fb-1. Assuming that the asymmetry A is due to asymmetric B0↔B̄0 mixing and decay, we extract the CP-violation parameter of B0 mixing and decay: ( B0)1+| B0|2=AB04=-0.0023±0.0011(stat)±0.0008(syst).AB0 is the dimuon charge asymmetry from decays of B0B̄0 pairs. The general case, with CP violation in both B0 and Bs0 systems, is also considered. Finally we obtain the forward-backward asymmetry that quantifies the tendency of μ+ to go in the proton direction and μ- to go in the antiproton direction. The results are consistent with the standard model and constrain new physics. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using 425pb-1 of data collected using the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, and enhancing the tt̄ content of the sample by tagging b jets with a secondary vertex tagging algorithm, the tt̄ production cross section is measured to be σpp̄→tt̄+X=6.6±0.9(stat+syst) ±0.4(lum)pb.

We use 370pb-1 of data collected by the D0 experiment and select events with at least one high transverse momentum electron or muon, high transverse energy imbalance, and four or more jets. We discriminate between b- and b̄-quark jets by using the charge and momenta of tracks within the jet cones. The data are consistent with the expected electric charge, |q|=2e/3. We exclude, at the 92% C.L., that the sample is solely due to the production of exotic quark pairs QQ̄ with |q|=4e/3. We place an upper limit on the fraction of QQ̄ pairs ρ<0.80 at the 90% C.L. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We reconstruct the decay angle θ* for each lepton. By comparing the cos θ* distribution from the data with that for the expected background and signal for various values of f+ (where we assume that the fraction of longitudinally-polarized W bosons has the standard model value of 0.70), we find f+=0.056±0.080(stat)±0.057(syst) (f+<0.23 at 95% C.L.), consistent with the standard model prediction of f+=3.6×10-4. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The measurement is made for events with electron-positron mass 71<Mee<111GeV and uses 0.4fb-1 of data collected at the Fermilab Tevatron collider with the D0 detector. This measurement significantly reduces the uncertainties on the rapidity distribution in the forward region compared with previous measurements.

34347369825	Measurement of the top quark mass in the lepton+jets channel using the ideogram method	A measurement of the top quark mass using events with one charged lepton, missing transverse energy, and jets in the final state, collected by the D0 detector from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron collider, is presented. A constrained fit is used to fully reconstruct the kinematics of the events. For every event a top quark mass likelihood is calculated taking into account all possible jet assignments and the probability that an event is signal or background. Lifetime-based identification of b jets is employed to enhance the separation between tt̄ signal and background from other physics processes and to improve the assignment of the observed jets to the quarks in the tt̄ hypothesis. We extract a multiplicative jet energy scale (JES) factor in situ, greatly reducing the systematic effect related to the jet energy measurement. In a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 425pb-1, we observe 230 candidate events, with an estimated background of 123 events, and measure mt=173.7±4.4(stat+JES)-2.0+2.1(syst)GeV.

Technicolor predicts that technipions πT decay dominantly into bb̄, bc̄, or b̄c, depending on their charge. In these events b and c quarks are identified by their secondary decay vertices within jets. Two analysis methods based on topological variables are presented.

We consider decay channels containing two high pT charged leptons (either e or μ) from leptonic decays of both top-daughter W bosons. These were gathered using four sets of selection criteria, three of which required that a pair of fully identified leptons (i.e., eμ, ee, or μμ) be found. The fourth approach imposed less restrictive criteria on one of the lepton candidates and required that at least one hadronic jet in each event be tagged as containing a b quark. For a top quark mass of 175 GeV, the measured cross section is 7.4±1.4(stat)±1.0(syst)pb and for the current Tevatron average top quark mass of 170.9 GeV, the resulting value of the cross section is 7.8±1.8(stat+syst)pb. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

From our measurements of the angular parameters we conclude that there is no evidence for a deviation from flavor SU(3) symmetry for these decays and that the factorization assumption is not valid for the Bd0→J/ψK*0 decay. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

84887484748	Studies of the performance of the ATLAS detector using cosmic-ray muons	Muons from cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere provide a high-statistics source of particles that can be used to study the performance and calibration of the AT-LAS detector. Cosmic-ray muons can penetrate to the cavern and deposit energy in all detector subsystems. Such events have played an important role in the commissioning of the detector since the start of the installation phase in 2005 and were particularly important for understanding the detector performance in the time prior to the arrival of the first LHC beams. Global cosmic-ray runs were undertaken in both 2008 and 2009 and these data have been used through to the early phases of collision data-taking as a tool for calibration, alignment and detector monitoring. These large datasets have also been used for detector performance studies, including investigations that rely on the combined performance of different subsystems. This paper presents the results of performance studies related to combined tracking, lepton identification and the reconstruction of jets and missing transverse energy. Results are compared to expectations based on a cosmic-ray event generator and a full simulation of the detector response. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2011.

The data were collected with the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider and correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 1fb-1. We search for e* in the process pp̄→e*e, with the e* subsequently decaying to an electron plus photon. No excess above the standard model background is observed. Interpreting our data in the context of a model that describes e* production by four-fermion contact interactions and e* decay via electroweak processes, we set 95% C.L. upper limits on the production cross section ranging from 8.9 to 27 fb, depending on the mass of the excited electron. Choosing the scale for contact interactions to be Λ=1TeV, excited electron masses below 756 GeV are excluded at the 95% C.L. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

47649097826	Evidence for production of single top quarks	We present first evidence for the production of single top quarks in the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron pp̄ collider. The standard model predicts that the electroweak interaction can produce a top quark together with an antibottom quark or light quark, without the antiparticle top-quark partner that is always produced from strong-coupling processes. Top quarks were first observed in pair production in 1995, and since then, single top-quark production has been searched for in ever larger data sets. In this analysis, we select events from a 0.9fb-1 data set that have an electron or muon and missing transverse energy from the decay of a W boson from the top-quark decay, and two, three, or four jets, with one or two of the jets identified as originating from a b hadron decay. The selected events are mostly backgrounds such as W+jets and tt̄ events, which we separate from the expected signals using three multivariate analysis techniques: boosted decision trees, Bayesian neural networks, and matrix-element calculations. A binned likelihood fit of the signal cross section plus background to the data from the combination of the results from the three analysis methods gives a cross section for single top-quark production of σ(pp̄→tb+X,tqb+X)=4.7±1.3pb. The probability to measure a cross section at this value or higher in the absence of signal is 0.014%, corresponding to a 3.6 standard deviation significance. The measured cross section value is compatible at the 10% level with the standard model prediction for electroweak top-quark production. We use the cross section measurement to directly determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa quark mixing matrix element that describes the Wtb coupling and find |Vtbf1L|=1.31-0.21+0.25, where f1L is a generic vector coupling. This model-independent measurement translates into 0.68<|Vtb|≤1 at the 95% C.L. in the standard model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

By precisely reconstructing the direction of the electromagnetic shower we are able to probe much longer lifetimes than previously explored.

We examine these data to study the Lorentz structure of the Wtb coupling. The standard model predicts a left-handed vector coupling at the Wtb vertex. The most general lowest dimension, CP-conserving Lagrangian admits right-handed vector and left- or right-handed tensor couplings as well. We find that the data prefer the left-handed vector coupling and set upper limits on the anomalous couplings.

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.© 2010 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

Results on the detector operation, timing performance, electronics noise, and gain stability are presented. High energy deposits from radiative cosmic muons and beam splash events allow to check the intrinsic constant term of the energy resolution. The uniformity of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter response along η (averaged over Φ) is measured at the percent level using minimum ionizing cosmic muons.

Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo (MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune. In all the kinematic regions considered, the particle multiplicities are higher than predicted by the MC models. The central charged-particle multiplicity per event and unit of pseudorapidity, for tracks with pT < 100 MeV, is measured to be 3.483±0.009 (stat)±0.106 (syst) at s = 0.9 TeV and 5.630±0.003 (stat)±0.169 (syst) at s = 7 TeV. © 2011 CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS Collaboration, published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd for the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

84884306084	Luminosity determination in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC	Measurements of luminosity obtained using the ATLAS detector during early running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at √s = 7 TeV are presented. The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of μ, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and μ-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0 < μ < 2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of ±11%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents. After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ by at most ±2%. The visible cross sections measured using the beam scans are compared to predictions obtained with the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators and the ATLAS detector simulation. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2011.
