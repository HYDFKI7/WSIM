35248824691	Impact of business service modes on distribution systems: A reinforcement learning approach	In this paper we identify several typical business service modes in a general distribution system composed of a single distributor and multiple retailers. For different service models, the business process can be different and each member of the distribution system may observe different level of information. Each member makes decisions to minimize its long-run-average cost or maximize its profit. A reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to obtain the decision policies and system costs. By comparing the system costs in various business service modes, we show numerically the impact of different business service modes on the distribution system. The results provide managerial insights into actual decision making in distribution systems. © 2007 IEEE.

35248875318	A novel approach for process mining based on event types	Process mining aims at distilling useful knowledge from the execution logs of process models. It has become a vivid research area in recent years. In this paper, a novel approach for process mining based on two event types, i.e., START and COMPLETE, is proposed. Information about the start and completion of tasks can be used to explicitly detect parallelism. The algorithm presented in this paper overcomes some of the limitations of existing algorithms such as the a-algorithm (e.g., short-loops) and therefore enhances the applicability of process mining in practical situations. Based on the completeness of the given event log and the behavior theory of Petri nets, the correctness of the algorithm can be proved theoretically. © 2007 IEEE.

38049127392	Geo-spatial clustering with non-spatial attributes and geographic non-overlapping constraint: A penalized spatial distance measure	In many geography-related problems, clustering technologies are widely required to identify significant areas containing spatial objects, particularly, the object with non-spatial attributes. At most of times, the resultant geographic areas should satisfy the geographic non-overlapping constraint. That is, the areas should not be overlapped with other areas. If without non-spatial attributes, most spatial clustering approaches can obtain such results. But in the presence of non-spatial attributes, many clustering methods can not guarantee this condition, since the clustering results may be dominated in non-spatial attribute domain which can not reflect the geographic constraint. In this paper, a new spatial distance measure called penalized spatial distance (PSD) is presented, and it is proofed to satisfy the condition which can guarantee the constraint. PSD achieves this by well adjusting the spatial distance between two points according to the non-spatial attribute values between them. The clustering effectiveness of PSD incorporated with CLARANS is evaluated on both artificial data sets and a real banking analysis case. It demonstrates that PSD can effectively discover the non-spatial knowledge and contribute more reasonably to spatial clustering problem solving. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

58049133513	Analysis on merchandise hierarchy via clustering retail records	Merchandise hierarchy plays an important role in modern retail business. In this paper, we suggest a quantitative consumer-related evaluation method of merchandise hierarchy via clustering the retail records. The retail records contains much information reflecting the consumer buying behavior, and it should be effectively utilized to judge whether a predefined merchandise hierarchy is appropriate for a specific retailer's business. Here, we mainly mine the complementary information between products from the retail records, that reflect some crucial consumer buying habits and can be used to evaluate predefined merchandise hierarchy. Concretely, the spectral clustering algorithm is adopted to obtain the cluster assignments of items on each level of merchandise hierarchy and Normalized Mutual Information is used to compare the cluster results and the corresponding merchandise hierarchy. We conduct some experiments on a real supermarket retail records and get some interesting and valuable consumer insights. Besides the merchandise hierarchy evaluation work, we further provide a preliminary scheme that can refine the merchandise hierarchy by clustering the retail records. ©2008 IEEE.

58049141152	Mixed integer programming based nested partition algorithm for facility location optimization problems	Facility location optimization is very important for many retail industries, such as banking network, chain stores, and so on. Maximal covering location problem (MCLP) is one of the well-known models for these facility location optimization problems, which has earned extensive research interests. However,various practical requirements limit the application of the traditional formulation of MCLP, and the NP-hard characteristic makes effective approaches for large scale problems extremely difficult. This paper focuses on a facility location problem motivated by a practical project of bank branching. The traditional MCLP formulation is generalized as a mixed integer programming (MIP) with considerations of various costs and revenues, multi-type of facilities, and flexible coverage functions. A CPLEX-based hybrid nested partition algorithm is developed for large scale problems, and heuristic-based extensions are introduced to deal with extremely large problems. Our formulation and algorithm are embedded into an asset called IFAO-SIMO. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. ©2008 IEEE.

77954321836	A novel framework for facility location evaluation	Is a given location appropriate to set a facility, and if it is, how will this facility perform? This is denoted as the facility location problem, which has attracted interests of academic researchers and industrial practitioners. This problem is traditionally considered in spatial analysis and forecasting literature. However, existing methods can hardly handle the problem well because of the fragmented information and insufficient training data. In this paper, we present a novel framework which combines spatial analysis and forecasting analysis for facility location. Firstly, a classifier is built on spatial information to evaluate locations' environmental patterns. For each pattern, a predictor is then constructed to predict facility performance. Besides, we also propose a data aggregation method to pre-process raw spatial data, and a semisupervised learning method to expand insufficient training data. Experimental results of a case study demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on supporting real-world facility location decisions. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

43049094776	Optimal Iterative Learning Control for Batch Processes Based on Linear Time-varying Perturbation Model	A batch-to-batch optimal iterative learning control (ILC) strategy for the tracking control of product quality in batch processes is presented. The linear time-varying perturbation (LTVP) model is built for product quality around the nominal trajectories. To address problems of model-plant mismatches, model prediction errors in the previous batch run are added to the model predictions for the current batch run. Then tracking error transition models can be built, and the ILC law with direct error feedback is explicitly obtained. A rigorous theorem is proposed, to prove the convergence of tracking error under ILC. The proposed methodology is illustrated on a typical batch reactor and the results show that the performance of trajectory tracking is gradually improved by the ILC. © 2008 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

Generally, we do not make the assumption of existence of classes and do not want to find the classification boundaries. Instead, we only assume that the data point cloud can construct a graph which describes the manifold structure, and there are multiple concepts on different parts of the manifold. By maximizing the distance between different concepts and simultaneously preserving the local structure on the manifold, the learned metric can indeed give good ranking results. Moreover, based on the theoretical analysis of the relationship between graph Laplacian and manifold Laplace-Beltrami operator, we develop an online learning algorithm that can incrementally learn the unlabeled data. © 2008 SPIE-IS&T.

SmartSCOR sees transformation in two different levels, from supply chain strategy design/redesign to supply chain process improvement. Supply chain strategy design/redesign transforms a supply chain in a fundamental manner by means of manufacturing and distribution network reconfiguration, value chain integration, etc. Supply chain process improvement helps align the underlying business processes to strategy setting and get them streamlined. The two levels interact with each other and result in a profound while smooth transformation.

46149120832	Linking strategic objectives to operations: Towards a more effective supply chain decision making	Supply chain managers today face an unremitting challenge to their capabilities in both the volume and complexity of factors to be reconciled. In order to achieve more effective decision making, it is very necessary to link strategic objectives to operational actions. However, little is available to guide managers in translating a set of objectives into operations so far. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology to address this gap. In this methodology, strategic objectives are translated into performance metrics by qualitative strategy map and metric network firstly, and then quantitative techniques such as system dynamics simulation and optimization are adopted to take managers through the stages of strategy mapping, action evaluation and decision making. A case study, supported by a software tool, is carried out throughout the paper to illustrate how the method works. © 2006 IEEE.

46249133242	Batch-to-batch control of fed-batch processes using control-affine feedforward neural network	A control strategy for fed-batch processes is proposed based on control affine feed-forward neural network (CAFNN). Many fed-batch processes can be considered as a class of control affine nonlinear systems. CAFNN is constructed by a special structure to fit the control affine system. It is similar to a multi-layer feed-forward neural network, but it has its own particular feature to model the fed-batch process. CAFNN can be trained by a modified Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. However, due to model-plant mismatches and unknown disturbances, the optimal control policy calculated based on the CAFNN model may not be optimal when applied to the fed-batch process. In terms of the repetitive nature of fed-batch processes, iterative learning control (ILC) can be used to improve the process performance from batch to batch. Due to the special structure of CAFNN, the gradient information of CAFNN can be computed analytically and applied to the batch-to-batch ILC. Under the ILC strategy from batch to batch, endpoint product qualities of fed-batch processes can be improved gradually. The proposed control scheme is illustrated on a simulated fed-batch ethanol fermentation process. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

At the top level of iFAO-Simo, an optimization engine serves to generate and test candidate solutions iteratively by use of optimization algorithms such as Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms. For each scenario given by the candidate solutions, a discrete event simulation engine is triggered to simulate customer and facility behaviors based on a GIS platform to characterize and visualize the spatial, dynamic and indeterministic environments. As the result, the target measures can be easily calculated to evaluate the solution and feedback to the optimization engine.

52049122105	IFAO: Spatial decision support services for facility network transformation	Facility Network Transformation (FNT) is a strategic approach involving assessing and optimizing the industrial facility networks such as new site selection, demand forecasting, performance evaluation in banking, retailing, etc. In practice, FNT requirements are often diverse, dynamic and industry specific, it's often difficult to implement a generic FNT service fully integrated with legacy systems. The heterogeneity of spatial information further calls for a loosely coupled architecture. An innovative spatial decision support system, iFAO (Intelligent Facility Network Analytics and Optimization), is therefore developed based on Service Oriented Architecture for FNT problems. In this paper, key FNT service patterns are identified and modeled to develop an industrial independent solution, and an SOA-based framework for iFAO is proposed correspondingly. Implementation of iFAO services is presented with a Model-Driven approach. With a real case in banking, it's illustrated how the SOA based iFAO services are integrated to solve the real industrial problems, especially for quick decisions on business strategy in the competitive and ever-changing marketplaces. © 2008 IEEE.

The analysis of the pressure sequence should be a novel research area. It has been used for identity verification in our previous research. In this paper, we use the pressure sequence for emotion recognition. Three methods (global features of pressure sequences, dynamic time warping and traditional keystroke dynamics) are proposed for the emotion recognition task; then we combined the three methods together using a classifier fusion technique. Several experiments were performed on a database containing 3000 samples (from 50 individuals, including six emotions: neutral, anger, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) and the best result were achieved utilizing all the method, obtaining an overall accuracy of 93.4%.

In such a way, we will show that the constructed classifiers will be more powerful, and this will also be validated by the final empirical study on several benchmark data sets.

58149140095	Enhancing facility locating via a novel hybrid model	Given its importance, facility location has long attracted many research efforts from both the academic and industrial areas. However, due to the cost and privacy issues, researchers usually suffer from the lack of business information which is crucial for the decision makings. Recent years have witnessed the explosion of geographical information systems (GISs), and the spatial information provided by GISs becomes a valuable supplement to the limited business information for facility location decision. Along this line, in this paper, we present a hybrid model which combines spatial analysis and forecasting analysis to solve this problem. That is, a classifier is built first on the spatial data to evaluate environmental conditions of the location. Then based on the classification results, a predictor is built on both the spatial and business data to predict the facility's performance. To deal with the problem of missing much business information while building the classifier, we also propose a semi-supervised learning method to expand the training data set. Finally, experimental results on a case study demonstrate that the hybrid model indeed shows merits on supporting real-world facility location decisions. ©2008 IEEE.

60749104741	Max-min optimality of service rates in queueing systems with customer-average performance criterion	In this paper, we consider the optimization of service rates in queueing systems, especially in closed Jackson networks. The optimization criterion is the customer-average performance, which is another important performance metric compared with the traditional time-average performance. Based on the methodology of perturbation analysis, we can derive a performance difference equation when the service rates are changed. With this difference equation, we find the optimal service rates have a Max-Min property, i.e., the optimal service rates can be chosen from its maximal or minimal value. This property can reduce the complexity of this type of optimization problems. Moreover, we also prove the max-min optimality is valid for both state-dependent service rates and load-dependent service rates in queueing systems.©2008 IEEE.

Instead of giving the computer what are the important factors that affect the final rank value, we only give several most certainly ranked points which implicitly contain the knowledge of the ranking factors. Then the computer can automatically use the most certain points and plenty of unlabeded data to learn an informative metric for ranking. This metric not only can help to regress an order in the observed data, but also can be used to retrieve the data by querying new test points. Moreover, the lower-rank distance metric can be used to visualize high-dimensional data. We also present an application to the housing potential estimation problem. It is shown that the algorithm is efficient to help consultants to refine their consulting work. Copyright 2007 ACM.

67549146737	Towards data management of web-based spatial decision support: The case of facility network transformation analysis services	Facility is the most important but costly channel for many enterprises to win in the customer-centric marketplace. How to optimize facility site network is part of the critical strategic nuts for executives. Many enterprises have adopted Geographic Information System (GIS) based solutions to support facility related business analysis, which, however, are usually based on desktop applications and are costly and need specialists' management. Thus in this paper, a light-weighted and easy-to-use web-based spatial decision support system on facility transformation analysis, iFAO (intelligent facility network analytics & optimization), is introduced. Employing web services technology, it could host facility related business analysis services for different enterprises in different industries. How to enable the information sharing and analysis collaboration, which we call data management, is one of the key issues in this servicehosting environment. After analyzing the characteristics of three types of data used in this kind of system, we introduce a common data management framework and three technologies to realize it. Besides, we present its detail implementations, a series of web services, which is also an extension to the OGC Service Architecture. The framework has been validated by the applications of iFAO in real banking and retail projects and it is also applicable to other web GIS based decision support solutions. © 2008 IEEE.

Control affine feed-forward neural network (CAFNN) is proposed to build a model of semi-batch process. The main advantage of CAFNN is to obtain analytically its gradient of endpoint products with respect to input. Therefore, an optimal ILC law with direct error feedback is obtained explicitly, and the convergence of tracking error can be analyzed theoretically. It has been proved that the tracking errors may converge to small values. The proposed modeling and control strategy is illustrated on a simulated isothermal semi-batch reactor, and the results show that the endpoint products can be improved gradually from batch to batch. © 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

74549169933	ROSE: Retail outlet site evaluation by learning with both sample and feature preference	It is critical for retail enterprises to select good sites or locations to open their stores, especially in current competitive retail market. However, evaluating the goodness of sites in real business applications is a complex problem. That is, how to judge whether the market around a store site is good? We don't know the exact mechanism of how a site can be good and it is hard to have correct site goodness values as supervised labels. The Retail Outlet Site Evaluation (ROSE) tool is designed to learn the site evaluation model by integrating city geographic & demographic data and two kinds of expert knowledge: sample preference and feature preference. The feature preference information can help greatly reduce the required number of sample preferences. It enables our application practicable because it is almost impossible to give such amount of sample preference pairs manually by experts when ranking hundreds of data points. In the experiment and case study part, we show that the ROSE tool can achieve good results and useful for users to do site evaluation work in real cases. Copyright 2009 ACM.

77952241014	An accurate penalty-based approach for reliability-based design optimization	A typical reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) problem is usually formulated as a stochastic optimization model where the performance of a system is optimized with the reliability requirements being satisfied. Most existing RBDO methods divide the problem into two sub-problems: one relates to reliability analysis, the other relates to optimization. Traditional approaches nest the two sub-problems with the reliability analysis as the inner loop and the optimization as the outer loop. Such nested approaches face the challenge of prohibitive computational expense that drives recent research focusing on decoupling the two loops or even fundamentally transforming the two-loop structure into one deterministic optimization problem. While promising, the potential issue in these computationally efficient approaches is the lowered accuracy. In this paper, a new decoupled approach, which performs the two loops sequentially, is proposed. First, a deterministic optimization problem is solved to locate the means of the uncertain design variables. After the mean values are determined, the reliability analysis is performed. A new deterministic optimization problem is then restructured with a penalty added to each limit-state function to improve the solution iteratively. Most existing research on decoupled approaches linearizes the limit-state functions or introduces the penalty into the limit-state functions, which may suffer the approximation error. In this research, the penalty term is introduced to change the right hand side (RHS) value of the deterministic constraints. Without linearizing or transforming the formulations of limit-state function, this penalty-based approach effectively improves the accuracy of RBDO. Comparison experiments are conducted to illustrate how the proposed method obtains improved solutions with acceptable computational cost when compared to other RBDO approaches collected from literature. © 2009 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

77957015911	Neural network based iterative learning control for product qualities in batch processes	A neural network based iterative learning control (NN-ILC) strategy is proposed to improve the product qualities in batch processes. Based on the repetitive nature of batch processes, iterative learning control (ILC) is used to improve product qualities gradually from batch to batch. The learning gain in the ILC is usually determined according to a linearised model. Instead of building a model for the system dynamics, a feed-forward neural network (FNN) is used directly as a non-linear learning gain in the ILC law. The tracking error profile of the previous batch is used as the input of the FNN, while the output of the network is the control change profile for the next batch run. It has been proved that if the network is trained properly based on the historical operation data, the tracking error under the proposed NN-ILC can converge to zero gradually with respect to the batch number. The neural network can also be retrained during the ILC to renew the learning gain in order to handle model uncertainties of the batch processes. The proposed control strategy is illustrated on a typical batch reactor. Copyright © 2010 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

One is demographic data, and the other is transactional data. Most of previous researchers and practitioners mainly focus on solely utilizing either type of data to segment customers. To obtain a stable and implementable consumer segmentation methodology with high efficiency and product recommendation accuracy for targeted customers, we propose an integrated customer segmentation method which takes advantages and avoids pitfalls of both the demographic information and the customer transactional data. As in the context of China's supermarkets, it is developed to reveal customer psychological behavior of shopping in supermarket. This method is theoretically validated and verified in a real China supermarket case. © 2010 IEEE.

Taking the potential housing place selection problem as an example, we have many candidate places together with their associated information (e.g., position, environment), and we know some extreme examples (i.e. several places are perfect for building a house, and several places are the worst that cannot build a house there), and we know some partially ordered constraints (i.e. for two places, which place is better), then how can we judge the preference of one potential place whose preference is unknown beforehand? We propose a Bayesian framework based on Gaussian process to tackle this problem, from which we not only solve for the unknown preferences, but also the hyperparameters contained in our model.

In this paper, we propose a novel semisupervised regression model for evaluating convenience store location based on spatial data analysis. First, the input features for each convenience store can be extracted by analyzing the elements around it based on a geographic information system, and the turnover is used to evaluate its performance. Second, considering the practical application scenario, a manifold regularization model with one semi-supervised performance information constraint is provided. The promising experimental results in the real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in performance prediction of certain candidate locations for new convenience store opening.

79951794668	Trees Weighting Random Forest method for classifying high-dimensional noisy data	Random forest is an excellent ensemble learning method, which is composed of multiple decision trees grown on random input samples and splitting nodes on a random subset of features. Due to its good classification and generalization ability, random forest has achieved success in various domains. However, random forest will generate many noisy trees when it learns from the data set that has high dimension with many noise features. These noisy trees will affect the classification accuracy, and even make a wrong decision for new instances. In this paper, we present a new approach to solve this problem through weighting the trees according to their classification ability, which is named Trees Weighting Random Forest (TWRF). Here, Out-Of-Bag, which is the training data subset generated by Bagging and not involved in building decision tree, is used to evaluate the tree. For simplicity, we choose the accuracy as the index that notes tree's classification ability and set it as the tree's weight. Experiments show that TWRF has better performance than the original random forest and other traditional methods, such as C45, Naïve Bayes and so on. © 2010 IEEE.

79953805479	Multi-index and self-approximate-optimal operation for a smart electrical power grid	An instrumented, intelligent electrical power grid, or smart grid , is under research and is being preliminarily constructed in many parts of the world to deal with new challenges to modern power systems brought on by pressures on environment and resources. In this paper, a smart grid with the ability of multi-index self-approximate-optimal operation is considered the most distinctive difference between a smart grid and a traditional power grid. Multi-index is the index set that consists of a series of key indices for the grid operating chain, including generation, transmission, distribution, consumption, and dispatching. Self-approximate-optimal refers to the process by which the electricity grid arrives at a satisfactory operation point from an unsatisfactory point by its automated closed-loop control and regulation. In this paper, the general architecture and solution algorithm of multi-index self-approximate-optimal operation are proposed and developed. Furthermore, two realistic and promising practices in China are described to illustrate how a smart grid can be achieved under the guidance of the proposed multi-index self-approximate-optimal operation. © 2010 IBM.

79955828144	Generation maintenance scheduling by security coordination considering transformer maintenance	The common maintenance scheduling problem in restructured power systems is addressed. When Independent System Operator(ISO) receives scheduling plans from multiple independent GENeration COmpanys(GENCOs), which seek to maximize their own medium-term profits, it tries to trade off the generation cost and the reliability of the system, thus reschedules the maintenance plans of the GENCOs. This paper brings in the effects of transformer maintenance, never considered in such problem before, and discovers interesting and useful phenomenons that would help us to deal with a more realistic power system. Based on the information of bus-wise unserved energy, we develop an original algorithm for ISO to send corrective signals to the GENCOs for altering their maintenance schedule. An iterative scheme is used between GENCOs and ISO until the system fulfills acceptable reliability. Finally, a case is carefully studied to show the effectiveness of our method. © 2011 IEEE.

80052196382	Research on stateful web service modeling based on extended petri net	In the environment of Internet of things, devices are encapsulated as web services and device operations are encapsulated as web service methods. These web services are stateful because devices can't be controlled by more than one client at the same time. Traditional web service composition methods are lack of considering state of the web services and have great challenge under Internet of things. In this paper, a three-layer model for modeling stateful web services composition based on extended Petri net is proposed. It includes web services layer, ws-resource layer and process layer. A method of a web service is abstracted as a ws-resource. There are two types of ws-resources: exclusive resources can be invoked serially, non-exclusive resources can be invoked simultaneously. In this model, a web service is associated with one or more ws-resources, a web service can be invoked only when all needed ws-resources are available. Finally an example is demonstrated to illustrate how this model works. © 2011 IEEE.

80053147753	A comprehensive device collaboration model for integrating devices with web services under Internet of things	As the rapid development of Internet of things, a large number of devices, instruments and sensors will connect and collaborate to achieve Smart Planet. One of the key challenges is to integrate devices into business process. SOA is an ideal infrastructure for business process management as applications are invoked using standard interfaces and protocols. It's convenient to use device-oriented web services (doWS) to encapsulate devices functions. A doWS may conflict with other doWS because devices can't be controlled by more than one client at the same time. This brings additional complexity to web service composition. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive device collaboration model to doWS choreography. This model includes device layer, doWS layer, compatible resource layer and process layer, where device layer represent devices; doWS layer encapsulates devices functions; compatible resource layer abstracts compatible device operations as resource and avoid of conflict; process layer describes the collaboration process. Analysis shows that, this model can integrate devices with Web Services, and can achieve the conflict detection of doWS. This model is effective in the Internet of things. © 2011 IEEE.

This network is an important core competency and is fundamental to ICBC business development. To keep its leading position in the fast-changing and competitive China market, ICBC needed to reconfigure its branch locations and service capabilities to match the regional economy and customer distribution; therefore, it had to quickly identify new high-potential market areas in which to open branches. ICBC partnered with IBM to customize an operations research-based branch network optimization system, Branch Reconfiguration (BR), which it has implemented in over 40 major cities in China. In a typical major city (e.g., Suzhou), ICBC attributes US $1.04 billion in increased deposits to BR. The BR project is an example of successfully using operations research and management sciences to transform the service channels of a large bank in a manner that will continue to improve the bank's business development and decision making. © 2012 INFORMS.

84859942720	Mode choice for the intermodal transportation considering carbon emissions	The intermodal transportation as an effective logistics solution can provide timely and high quality service for customers. Especially with the rapid development of logistics industry, the intermodal transportation is becoming a very common practice in the industry today. The operation cost can be reduced to a great extent if different transportation modes are well connected and synchronized. Most existing research about intermodal transportation optimization focused on minimizing the total logistics cost, and/or maximizing the customer satisfied degree, etc. The impact of carbon emissions by different transportation carriers is seldom considered. However, transportation industry plays an important role for the carbon emissions reduction. Some corresponding rules, such as carbon tax, have been proposed to help reducing the carbon emissions in developed countries. Logistics companies need to balance the profit and the carbon emissions. This paper presents an approach to optimize the choice of transportation modes for intermodal transportation with consideration of carbon emissions. An integer programming model is proposed, of which the objective is to minimize the total cost including both logistics costs and costs related to carbon emissions. The computational results are also presented to illustrate the impact of considering carbon emissions on intermodal transportation. © 2011 IEEE.

84859963374	A Lagrangean-based heuristic for a two-stage facility location problem with handling costs	This paper considers a multi-product and two-stage facility location problem with three layers of nodes: plants with limited production capacities, capacitated DCs to be located, and customers with known demands per product. The goal is to minimize a global cost including DC opening costs, transportation costs, and handling costs. The latter are not simply proportional to the amounts of products traversing DCs. They are modeled in a realistic way by associating each cross-docking task occurred at DCs with a limited set of handling modules. Each module for some task is a combination of manpower and equipment with a handling capacity and a handling cost, for instance a set of forklifts with their drivers to accomplish unloading task. The handling cost of a module is incurred as soon as the module is used, even for a fraction of its handling capacity. In order to obtain good lower and upper bounds, an heuristic based on Lagrangean relaxation is designed. The computational results show that our approach provides high quality solutions and outperforms CPLEX. © 2011 IEEE.

84859978850	Modeling cross-organizational services composition with Pi-calculus	Cross-organizational services composition is process-oriented and need collaboration of several systems, and these characteristics are different from normal. Traditional services composition modeling methods cannot meet these new requirements because they don't have mechanisms to model the concurrency operations of several systems. Target on this problem, a cross-organizational services composition modeling method based on Pi calculus is proposed. Using Pi calculus, a cross-organizational business process is modeled as a composition of a set concurrent local business processes, the cross-organization controller, the global start activity and global end activity. Local business processes is modeled as a composition of local activities which can receive external start message compared with traditional activities in service composition. This new cross-organizational services composition modeling method can makes the model adapt to dynamic cross-organizational environment. And this model is based on strict formal method, which facilitates the analysis and verification of business process models. © 2011 IEEE.

84859984166	RAnking with relative comparisons for evaluating supermarket location cities	Nowadays, choosing potential cities where to open new stores (especially supermarkets) and expand business plays a very important role for leading retailers due to the influence of huge and long-term investment. However, it is very time consuming for decision makers or experienced analysts to go through the whole city data and determine which city is better for a new supermarket. In the computer aided decision making scenario, retailers would like computers to model the data well enough to give a considerable rank result when some information is provided. In the real world new supermarket potential city selection problem, we find out that analysts can usually give some partially ordered information (i.e., for two cities, which city is better) and some relative comparison information (i.e., for three cities, the rank of city B is more close to city A than city C is to A) with high confidence. So in this paper, we propose a novel ranking model, which can deal with these two kinds of information together to evaluate the rank of cities. The promising experimental results in real world application data demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for evaluating rank of cities for choosing new supermarket location cities. © 2011 IEEE.

84859988904	Towards automatic incremental synchronization of multiple process models via information flow optimization	Process model is one of the foundation stones of business process management(BPM). In a lot of industrial practices of BPM, we encounter the requirements to synchronize process models. Although there have already been many research initiatives and mature solutions for two-model synchronization, multi-model synchronization is still a difficult question. Major challenges include how to define multi-model synchronization semantics and how to propagate changes across the multiple models in order to realize incremental synchronization. This paper proposes a solution in which the modification propagation is considered as information flow. After defining synchronization semantics, we work out a propagation scope for each tracked model change. Then an algorithm is designed to generate an propagation plan for all model changes, with the objective to optimize the information flow. The multiple process models get synchronized after all modifications are propagated according to the plan. A case from an industrial practice is used to demonstrate the semantics and algorithm of incremental synchronization of multiple process models. © 2011 IEEE.

Main reasons for launching public bike program is to reduce carbon footprint so as to prevent greenhouse effect and to solve Last-Mile problem in order to make convenient for citizens. However, we may encounter awkward cases in peak hours (from 7:00 to 9:00 and 17:00 to 19:00) that no bike is available at some stations or no vacant place is left to put bikes. The actual solution in most cities is in a traditional way based on call centers. A personnel taking charge of bikes in a certain zone reallocates bikes among bike stations based on notification of bike users by telephone call when bike stations are full or empty. This inefficient solution will reduce bike utilization and even annoy bike users. In this paper, we propose a system & methodology to intelligently guide personnel to reallocate bikes among stations, aiming at overcoming the above awkward cases and maximizing bike utilization. © 2012 IEEE.

84889979626	A generalized simulation framework for responsive supply network management	Firms are under the pressure to explore various strategies to improve the supply network performance so that customers' demands can be met more responsively. Many of the challenges fromimplementing the strategies lie in the distributed and dynamic nature of the network where geographically dispersed entities may have different goals and objectives. Additionally, irregularities and disruptions occurring at any point in the network may propagate through the network and amplify the negative impact. These disruptions, often occurring without warning due to the dynamic nature of a supply network, can lead to poor performance of the supply network. A key component in responsive supply network management is to proactively assess the robustness and resilience to disruption of a supply network.Discrete Event Simulation (DES) can achieve this. In this chapter, we introduce a simulation tool developed by IBM China Research Lab, named General Business Simulation Environment (GBSE). It can capture supply network dynamics with a fine level of granularity and provide useful insights to supply network's real operations. GBSE is designed for tactical-level decision making, and may be useful for supply network what-if analysis and risk analysis. The architecture of GBSE is detailed in this chapter followed by several scenarios in an automobile supply network to demonstrate the applicability of GBSE to assess the responsiveness of a supply network. © 2009 Springer London.

84910031254	Big data technologies in support of real time capturing and understanding of electric vehicle customers dynamics	Energy overconsumption and greenhouse gas emission have been contributing to air pollutions and the global warming for years. The unceasingly increasing number of fossil fuels based vehicles around the world is considered as one of main factors making to the situation worse year by year. Electric vehicles (EV) are promoted as a viable and promising alternative transportation means for customers. However, there is an array of issues hindering EVs from the fast adoption in the global auto market. As these issues bear different priorities that surely vary with marketplaces, it becomes essential for EV makers and governments to capture and understand the dynamics of EV consumers in real time. This paper explores how the emerging big data technologies can be applied to facilitate the process of deciphering the acceptance and behavior of EV customers from marketplace to marketplace.

84915753078	One-day-ahead load forecast using an adaptive approach	Electrical load forecasting is vitally important to modern power system planning, operation, and control. In this paper, by focusing on historical load data and calendar factors, we present a hybrid method using period refinement scheme and adaptive strategy for building peak hour period and off-peak hour period models in day-of-week for one-day-ahead for load forecasting. They are evaluated using three full years of Shenzhen city electricity load data. Experimental results shows the adaptive model for each period, confirm good accuracy of the proposed approach to load forecasting and indicate that it has better forecasting accuracy than traditional ANN method.
