With the proposed CMP process, the efficiency uniformity of several BSGs with an aperture of 430 mm × 430 mm has been successfully controlled within an rms of 5%. The proposed CMP process is an effective method to improve the efficiency uniformity of large-aperture BSGs.

A novel technique has been successfully developed to fabricate freestanding gold Moire gratings with ultraviolet (UV) lithography and ion beam etching. The key techniques, which affect grating characteristics, are presented, such as the gold film thickness and its quality and the grating duty cycle control. The experimental results show that the duty cycle of gratings can be considerably improved through the following techniques: designing the grating mask with small duty cycle, erasing the resist arris at the substrate edge to eliminate the refraction effect when doing UV lithography and rotating the tilted substrate when doing ion beam etching.

A novel technique has been successfully, in which oxygen reactive ions etching was used to achieve resist ashing of the grating, to fabricate diffraction gratings with holographic ion beam etching. The new technique was used to fabricate a spherical blazed grating, 1200g/mm and 130 nm blazed wavelength, and some laminar gratings for monochromators in the beamline of National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The results show that the new technique can considerably lower the stringent requirements of holographic exposure and development, and makes it controllable to make smooth grooves with desirable depth and duty cycle. A gold transmission grating is one of the critical elements in the soft x-ray spectrometer for plasma diagnostics.

19844371309	Design of variable line-space plane gratings with holographic recording	Variable Line-Space gratings play an important role in focusing and aberration-reduced. They are widely used in spatial spectrum and synchrotron radiation facilities. However the design and fabrication methods of them are difficult. The problem is to be able to record holographically the expected grooves distribution. The geometric theory of aspheric wave-front recording optics is briefly described. We introduce the genetic algorithm to the parameters optimization of holographic variable line-space gratings. In order to obtain a steady set of recording parameters, we propose that the objective function of the genetic algorithm should consider the effect of the recording parameters errors. The integral expression of the objective function is also derived to improve the efficiency of calculation. Design example of holographic variable line-space plane gratings for a position sensor is given to demonstrate the capability of this method. The line-profiles of variable line-space plane gratings with different recording parameters are also compared in this paper.

The coordinate transformation method (the C method) is a very efficient method for obtaining continuous surface-relief grating efficiency for both TE and TM polarization. The local linear grating model (LLGM) models 2-D circular diffractive lens with combination of a series of local linear gratings. We synthesized and analyzed circular diffractive lens with a continuous profile not as previous authors who always use multi-lever structures. The result is compared with that of scalar theory and analysis using LLGM and rigorous coupled-wave theory. This optimization can be used as a complement of the scalar design of diffractive lens.

A curved grating blank in a Rowland circle mounting could eliminate primary aberrations. Bending a plane constant-groove-density grating into a desirable surface can eliminate higher-order aberrations as a result of the change in surface profile and groove density. This provides a simple means for improving the imaging properties. When used in a monochromator, the grating can be bent to different degrees to minimize aberrations at all wavelengths. General formulas concerning the transformations of groove function, groove density, and groove spacing are presented for the bending grating.

The etching rates of Hf O2 film and photoresist mask in pure Ar and ArCH F3 mixture plasmas were measured as a function of ion energy, plasma composition, and ion beam incident angle. It has been found that the RIBE with ArCH F3 plasma is capable of lowering the threshold energy of ion beam and increasing sputtering yield, compared to the IBE with pure Ar. The redeposition of photoresist sidewall is a major issue, due to the formation of nonvolatile etching products during sputtering of Hf O2 film in both IBE and RIBE. However, the sidewall redeposition can be easily removed in HCl solutions with assistance of ultrasonic wave for RIBE with ArCH F3 plasma. Alternatively, the sidewall redeposition can be eliminated by controlling the slope of photoresist sidewall or combined with ion incident angle. © 2006 American Vacuum Society.

Their reflectivity is measured continuously in a broad vacuum ultraviolet range. It is indicated that the auxiliary ion-beam source and the film thickness impact significantly on the reflectivity. Substrate material and cleaning procedure also affect reflectivity of Au film to some extent. Ion-beam bombardment of substrate before deposition can significantly enhance the reflectivity and adhesion of films. The optimal film thickness for the highest reflectivity connects closely with substrate material and coating techniques. For quartz substrate processed by ion bombardment pre-deposition, the optimal film thickness is about 30 nm, and the reflectivity of quartz is higher than K9. The use of auxiliary ion beam source influences the optimal film thickness for the highest reflectivity, and the influence is larger for K9 substrate.

Two coating techniques, dip coating and spin coating, which have been broadly used at present, were introduced. Their properties and influences on the thickness of coatings were analyzed. Especially, the main factors of influences on the uniformity of coatings were analyzed in detail and some methods of obtaining maximum uniformity of coatings were proposed. For the dip-coating, it is a good idea to select a photoresist solution with a high viscous coefficient and withdraw the substrate at a proper speed out from high viscous solution because the methods can reduce the effects of marangoni flow and van der Waals force on the uniformity of coatings. When the spin-coating is employed, it is recommended that the coating chamber should be airproofed or an air-controller should be used to make air keep a laminar flow so that the solution can be uniformly evaporated and the uniformity of the coating is increased.

Samples were first measured by atomic force microscope (AFM). The acquired height data was then processed to calculate their power spectral density (PSD) and multi-fractal spectrum (MFS). The calculation results indicate that MFS of different samples with same sampling length differs significantly from each other, while the MFS of the same sample with different sampling length or different sampling position is quite similar. The calculation also shows that MFS is very sensitive to particles or scratches appeared on the surface. The PSD of the same data acquired from these samples are also presented for comparison. It is clear from the calculation results that the PSD curves vary with the sampling position and sampling length, thus makes the evaluation uncertain. No quantitative index available from PSD, only qualitative information obtained. Comparatively, MFS is better in description of a surface roughness.

Reflected by the first ellipsoidal mirror, the wave front of the light is changed, and after passing the grating the light is focused on different positions of the detector according to the difference of the wavelength by the second mirror. The spectral instruments are with complex aberration and imaging characteristics. According to Fermat principle, consulting the second generation varied-line-space grating's fabrication optical layout and theory, the coordinate system is setup, the angles of incidence and reflection are defined, the elements are located, and the basic geometrical relation is established. The optical path function is divided into two parts: one is associated with the diffraction, and the other is associated with the optical path change by the geometrical position. After the power series of the above two optical path are expanded, the analytical expressions of the high-order aberration are derived, which are useful in the plane, cylinder, spherical gratings, as well as reflector.

The flexible free-standing SU-8 allows the bonding of the nanochannels' pattern features at such a low pressure primarily because of 'sequential' bonding made possible by the bonding layer flexibility and the conformal contact made between the bonding layer and the structure layer in a large area. The simple geometrical argument shows that the height of the enclosed nanochannel can be determined by the depth of the cross-linked SU-8 trenches as well as by the initial thickness of the thin unexposed SU-8 layer. The height of the nanochannels can also be controlled by adjusting the ratio of the ridge width to the trench width on the SU-8 trenches. These simple relationships can serve as a guideline in choosing the parameters for SU-8 nanochannel fabrication. © 2014 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

The gold transmission phase gratings have been fabricated using holography and ion-beam etching techniques. The latent image monitoring technique and real time end-point detection technique were utilized to improve control of the shape of grooves and duty cycle during exposure and development, respectively. It is difficult to produce gratings with larger duty cycle in photoresist on gold for standing wave, nevertheless it is revealed in our work that the duty cycle can be more than 0.4 for the case for photoresist on gold substrates if development is stopped where the slope of the monitoring curve begins to drop off, not at the peak of the diffracted signal. In ion-beam milling, the influence of redeposition on the shape of grooves and duty cycle has been overcome by using a thin mask of Chromium with a comparatively low ion-etch rate and tilting and rotating substrates beneath the ion beam. Finally, some gold phase gratings with the duty cycles in the range of 0.25-0.45 have been obtained, whose duty cycle value is about 0.45, and their grooves profile is trapezoidal profile whose left and right facets are both more than 83 degrees approximately.

47949125428	The splitter grating used in the soft X-ray laser interferometer for plasma diagnosis	The short wavelength, high brightness and good spatial coherence of soft x-ray lasers make them ideal sources for the diagnostics of dense plasmas. As a widely used diagnosing tool in the research of laser-produced plasma, interferometry has many advantages in the accurate measurement of the plasma electron density because it directly gives refraction index mapping from the interference pattern processing. The electron density gradient and electron density of larger variety plasma will be probed by the soft X-ray diffraction grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DGI). At the wavelength 13.9nm which our DGI uses, we fabricate a laminar grating used as the splitter grating. Its groove density is 1000g/mm, groove depth is 13nm, duty cycle is 0.4±10%. The zero and first diffracted order beams have an equal metrical diffraction efficiency about 25 percent at 81.3 degrees, and the maximum of the product is 7.6 percent at 81.2 degrees. The results illustrate the laminar grating is suitable for being used as a new pattern splitter grating at the wavelength 13.9nm.

In this paper the theoretical background to the fiber position sensor concept is briefly described. The large slope groove density distribution variable-line-space grating with holographic recording is used in fiber position sensor. The preliminary results obtained were quite noteworthy. Due to the unevenness of the incident light intensity in different wavelength, the diffractive intensity of different position change quickly. The diffraction wavelength curve of the system is given.

49649129079	Reflective performance of Ir film in vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region	This paper theoretically and experimentally investigates the reflective performance of Ir films in the vacuum ultraviolet wavelength region. Ir reflecting layers of different thicknesses on various substrates are calculated and fabricated by the ion-beam-sputtering technique. Their reflectance in the 115 nm to 140 nm wavelength region was measured continuously by a reflectometer located at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The testing results show that the reflectance of Si substrates is quite sensitive to the deposited Ir layer thickness, while the reflectance on a quartz or a BK7 glass substrates is higher. The energy of the sputtering ion beam exerts a significant influence on the reflectance of the layer, and the postannealing can cause a substantial decrease in the reflectance. For normal incidence, the reflectance of an Ir film on BK7 glass can reach as high as 30%. © 2008 Optical Society of America.

And a detection system has been set up on the large SIBE equipment of our laboratory. In the detection system, a piece of transparent thin glass illuminated by He-Ne laser is used as sensitive element of etch depth, and half of the element is covered by a thin graphite plate when it is crossing through the ion beam. Then the relative moving distance of the sensitive element's fringes of equal thickness can be used to compute the etch depth. The experimental results show that the depths detected by this online system correspond very well with those measured by a surface profiler after etch process, and the difference between the two kinds of results is less than 10 nanometers. Several phase DOEs, such as phase Ronchi gratings, were successfully fabricated with this method. The main conclusion drawn from these results is that the novel on-line etch depth detection method can be reliably used in end-point determination for the SIBE process of DOEs made up of transparent material.

The reflective performance of Ir film in the VUV wavelength region was studied theoretically and experimentally. Based on the theoretical model of single metal layer on absorbing substrate, the optimum calculation was performed for Ir layer of various thickness on K9 glass and quartz substrate in the VUV wavelength region. Considering the calculation results and previous research, single layer Ir films of different thickness were fabricated on K9 glass and quartz substrate by electron gun evaporation system, and nearly 30% normal incident reflectivity at 120 nm incident wavelength was obtained, which corresponded to the optimum thickness of Ir layer of 12 nm. Ir layer of too thin or thick thickness cannot get high reflectivity. The annealing of the layer benefits the release of tension, but it also causes the increase of average size of Ir grain and degradation of the reflectivity.

84865596212	Fabrication of size-controllable nanofluidic channels using angled physical vapor deposition	In this paper, we demonstrate a new and simple method to achieve ultrasmall nanochannels downing size to about 50 nm with well-controlled dimensions in large area by using NIL and angled physical vapor deposition (PVD). The polymer SU-8 nanogratings substrate is fabricated using NIL. After NIL, oblique angle ion beam sputtering of silicon oxide was used, in a single step, to reduce the cross section of the SU-8 imprinted trenches and seal the channels at the same time. During this process, the sidewalls of any trench will shadow the evaporation and most of the silicon oxide film will be deposited on the sidewalls at the top of the trench, therefore, the shadow area will be protected and ultimately formed as sealed nanochannels on substrate. The advantage of this process is that the line width can be adjustable simply by controlling the deposition as well as the imprint depth, offering an alternative solution for high-resolution and low-cost fabrication of nanofluidic chip. The method is applicable for most substrates and cover layer, therefore, it provides a new way to produce size reduction and size controlling of nanopatterns for various material. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84867184794	Diffraction efficiency measurement of large aperture multilayer dielectric grating and its application in the fabrication process	Large aperture multilayer dielectric grating (MDG) is one of the key elements of high-power laser systems. In order to meet the requirements for large aperture MLG in a high-power laser system, a diffraction efficiency measurement system is developed for characterizing the diffraction efficiency of large MDG at 1064 nm and Littrow mounting. Through analyzinge the main factors such as detector signal-to-noise ratio and operating staff, which influence the testing results during measurement, their difference is obtained to be less than ± 1%, which proves that the method can be used to measure the diffraction efficiency of MDG. Based on a large number of experimental data, the optical characterization of MDG in a negative first-order Littrow configuration could provide some information about grating microstructure. So the diffraction efficiency measurements have a number of important applications in the fabrication process, as a nondestructive grating inspection tool, such as determining the suitable photoresist grating mask which meet the ion beam etching requirements, on line end-point detection during ion beam etching, and judging whether another etching is needed. Based on above techniques, a number of MDGs have been achieved, each of which has mean diffraction efficiency greater than 95% line density 1740 lines/mm, and aperture up to 430 mm×350 mm. The results show that this method can satisfy the requirements for simple operation, testing speediness and preciseness, in which any inspection is not necessary for the MDG microstructure paramters. ©2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84868262847	Flexible subwavelength gratings fabricated by reversal soft UV nanoimprint	We present a replication process, named reversal soft ultraviolet (UV) nanoimprint, to fabricate a high-aspect-ratio flexible subwavelength grating (SWG) on a polyurethane acrylate (PUA). This nanopatterning technique consists of casting, reversal UV imprint, and dry release. The UV curing process of PUA to avoid pattern collapse is investigated. Revalpha film acts as the supporting and sacrificial layer during the whole process due to its special surface energy property. The free-standing PUA structures with a period of 200 nm and a depth of 350 nm can be automatically released from the Revalpha film by heating. The PUA resist is well suited to replicate fine patterns of the mold with high aspect ratio and large area precisely and uniformly for low surface energy and low viscosity. The measured transmittance is compared with the calculation results based on rigorous coupled-wave analysis in the wavelength region ranging from 500 to 800 nm. The experimental results agree well with the theoretical calculations. © 2012 Chinese Optics Letters.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to evaluate surface cleanliness of the gratings. It is found that photoresist and fluorocarbon residues can be efficiently removed with oxygen-plasma cleaning and metal contaminants can be completely removed with HPM cleaning.

By using a 351nm collimation laser source to scan the full aperture of the sampling grating in every subregion, the diffraction power of "0" order and "+1" order can be obtained synchronously by two standard integrating balls, And then by calculating the sampling efficiency of this subregion and splicing the acquisition data, we can get the averaged grating sampling efficiency in the full aperture.Based on this method, we can effectively eliminate the effect of the output instability of laser source, decrease the uncertainty of test results. According to the fabrication principle of the sampling grating, measurements for the sampling focal length and the sampling angle can be performed.

84875598832	Fabrication of a new type of transmission grating with holography interferometry and wet anisotropic etching	As a new type of grating, the freestanding blazed transmission grating combines the advantages of traditional transmission gratings (low mass, relaxed alignment and flatness figure insensitivity) with those of reflection gratings (high broadband diffraction efficiency, high spectral resolution). A freestanding blazed transmission grating with period of 1μm was successfully fabricated by holographic lithography and anisotropic wet etching of silicon. The duty cycle is about 0.13. The aspect ratio of a single grating bar is about 77. The thickness is 10μm and the open area fraction is about 58.8%. The size of a single die is 15mm×15mm divided into four 5mm ×5mm windows. The diffraction efficiency of the grating was measured at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory in the wavelength region of 5-50nm.

84877029148	Studies on soft X-ray shearing interferometry with double-frequency gratings	The M-Z interferometer with gratings or multilayer mirrors is widely used in the X-ray laser plasma diagnoses; however, this system is difficult to adjust, and results in the low success rate in experiment. Since wavefront shearing interferometers do not need a separate reference wavefront, they have inherent advantages compared with conventional interferometers. But the absence of shearing element for soft X-ray has restrained the application of the shearing interferometry in soft X-ray measurement. In this paper, a new- structured double-frequency grating was proposed and fabricated that served as the shearing element for soft X-rays, which can promote the application of shearing interferometers in the X-ray laser plasma diagnoses. The diffraction characteristics of the double-frequency grating are analyzed and tested in the synchrotron radiation beams. It is found that the intensity ratio of the two working diffracted beams is over 75%, and the intensity ratio of the rest diffracted beam to the working beam is less than 5%. An X-ray shearing interferometer using a double-frequency grating with 1000 lines/mm and 1002.5 lines/mm gratings was set up, and a clear shear interferogram was obtained. The experimental results demonstrated that the soft X-ray shearing interferometer using double-frequency grating can be applied in the X-ray laser plasma diagnoses. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

84881642954	Design and fabrication of soft X-ray double frequency grating	Applications of a soft X-ray double frequency grating shearing interferometer to laser plasma diagnostics were explored by using a soft X-ray double frequency grating as the shearing interferometric element. To improve the success rate of experiment, this paper analyzed the line parallelism and diffraction efficiency of the double frequency grating. On the basis of the relationship between the line parallelism of the double frequency grating and the interferogram of shearing interferometer, it calculated the technical requirements of line parallelism of the grating. The fabrication method was described, the line parallelism of the grating was realized with the diffraction spot position monitoring, and the moiré fringe method was applied in line parallelism judgment for the grating. A double frequency grating with line parallelism less than 0.01° was fabricated. The two groups of diffraction efficiencies of-1 order for the grating were examined in spectral radiation standard and metrology beamline of Hefei National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, and the results show both of them are over 10% at 13.9 nm. A shearing interferometer was set up for dense plasma diagnostics, whose results demonstrate that the parallelism and diffraction efficiency of the double-frequency grating can meet the experimental requirements.

84883078275	Improve the laser damage resistance of fused silica by wet surface cleaning and optimized HF etch process	Fabrication-induced metal contaminations and subsurface damage are generally identified as the laser damage initiators that are responsible for the laser induced damage in fused silica. In this paper, the removal of those two initiators are realized by two methods: wet chemical surface cleaning and optimized HF-based etch process. Two kinds of chemical leaching are used to removing the Ce and other metal impurities respectively. In order prevent the redeposition of the reactive byproducts during HF etch process, we optimized the traditional HF etch process in two ways: absence of NH4F in etch solution and presence of megasonic and ultrasonic agitation during and after etch respectively. And laser damage tests show that these two treatments greatly improve the laser damage resistance of fused silica. © 2013 SPIE.

84891913183	Fabrication of SU-8 nanofluidic channels by reverse thermal bonding under mild conditions	A novel technique was developed to fabricate SU-8 nano-channels with controllable feature size by reverse thermal bonding under fairly mild conditions. The SU8 patterns were first fabricated by pouring photo-resist on the template, and then transferred to the ultraviolet (UV) tape, whose flexibility ensured that a large area of the patterned layer and the encapsulation layer of the Si substrate were laminated and well bonded, because UV irradiation is capable of completely removing the interfacial adhesion of the UV tape. The impacts of the interfacial adhesion on pattern transfer and bonding were evaluated. The nano-channels with different sizes were fabricated by accurately adjusting the thickness of the encapsulation layer. The fabrication mechanism was simulated in finite element method, and the influence of the capillary force on the bonding was also tentatively discussed.

84894111587	Optimum design of a holographic parallel flat-field grating	To widen the working waveband, a new holographic parallel flat-field grating (HPFG) with two sub-gratings lying parallel on the same substrate is designed. Grating parameters of the two gratings, one for 2~5 nm and the other for 5~30 nm, are optimized based on the aberration theory of concave grating. The radius tolerances of curvature of the substrate are also analyzed. Ray-traced spectral images indicate that errors cased by ±1% deviation of radius can be offset by shifting the detector position within 2.5 mm. Finally, we analyze the spectral image-focusing properties. Theoretical spectral resolution of this new HPFG is pretty much the same as that of existing holographic flat-field grating. The simulation results demonstrate that our work probably can be used in the compact spectrometers with a broad spectral region and moderately high resolution. © 2013 SPIE.

84896454383	Improving the spectral resolution of soft x-ray flat-field spectrometer with multi-area gratings	The ideal focal curve for the soft x-ray flat-field spectrometer is a straight line, but the real one is not, thus the inconformity of aberrations between different wavelengths in the working waveband is inevitable. In order to further reduce aberrations and improve spectral resolutions, multi-area gratings (divided perpendicular the direction of grating grooves) are devised. Firstly, the grating is divided into three areas, and the spectral aberrations for these areas are analyzed by means of ray tracing. Then, diffraction efficiencies for the areas with worse aberrations should be reduced to lower the proportion regional aberrations contributing to the overall aberration, therefore better spectral image could be obtained and the spectral resolution would be improved. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that: using multi-area grating, the spectral resolutions at wavelength of 0.8 and 1.1nm are increased from 123 and 333 to 401 and 671, respectively. At the same time, the spectral resolutions at other wavelengths are not reduced. © 2013 SPIE.

84902117688	Measurement method for duty cycles of rectangular gratings based on top-down SEM images	A novel method to measure duty cycles of rectangular gratings and evaluate the spatial uniformity of duty cycles was presented on the basis of top-down scanning electron microscope(SEM) images. This method first conducts image grayscale profile preprocessing on target images, then performs border detection based on dynamic programming and least-squares spline approximation, and finally computes the mean and standard deviations of duty cycles in the target area in light of the provided evaluation standards. Using this method, we can not only quickly and accurately measure grating duty cycles and perform quantitative analysis on the spatial uniformity of duty cycles, but also avoid damaging sample preparation process, which greatly make up the deficiency of traditional method. A top-down SEM image processing software, GradUI, for detecting duty cycles of rectangular gratings was developed. The top-down SEM images of several 1 200 lines/mm self-made gratings were processed with the software, and the root-mean-square deviation of the average duty cycle and the estimated value was 0.0173. The results show that the approach to calculate duty cycles based on top-down SEM images is feasible and of high efficiency, and the software is robust.

With 13.9 nm Ni-like Ag X-ray laser serving as a probe, using double frequency grating shearing interference technique, the electron density distribution of plasma produced by laser irradiating a gold planar target is measured. Clear interference fringe image is obtained. Preliminary deduction of the fringe shows that the maximum density measured is about 1.4 times the critical density. It is found that there are some discrepancies between experimental results and simulation results, which provides a useful reference to the further optimization of the simulation program. The experimental results fully demonstrate that the soft X-ray double frequency grating shearing interference technique is practical to diagnose near-critical-density plasma of medium and high-Z materials, which will have a good application value. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

Two flat-field gratings working in different wavebands, one for 2~5 nm and the other for 5~30 nm, are designed on the same substrate based on genetic algorithm, and the two gratings can work simultaneously because of the same working structure. Theoretical spectral resolution of PFHCGs is studied via ray-tracing method, which is pretty the same as that of existing commercial FHCG. Based on the optical path function theory, the recording optical path of PFHCGs is given. The results demonstrate the line density deviation is less than ±1 line/mm between theoretical value and optimization value. Simulation results show that the waveband of HPFCGs is broaden and the resolution is also ensured, so it is suitable for recording wider waveband of soft X-ray.

84916896342	Effect of curve groove on the spectral resolution for soft X-ray holographic flat-field gratings	The soft X-ray spectrograph is an important instrument for plasma diagnostics. As the core optical element of spectrograph, holographic flat-field grating is fabricated by aspheric wave-front recording optics, so grooves on the surface are curve. The curve grooves of the grating would affect the spectral image properties, thus influencing spectral resolutions. In the design of recording optics, only the groove density distribution on the surface in meridian line should be guaranteed, so optimized recording optics is not unique. Thus gratings with different curvatures of grooves but with expected groove density distribution could be obtained. For holographic flat-field gratings used in a 0.8-6 nm region, we analyze the influences of different curve grooves on the spectral image by ray tracing, and find that the almost straight grooves which are obtained by means of cylinder mirror can obtain the better spectral images. The theoretical results show that the spectral resolutions of grating with almost straight grooves are obviously improved compared with curve grooves, the theoretical spectral resolutions increase from 626 to 953 at 3 nm and from 635 to 1222 at 5 nm, respectively.
