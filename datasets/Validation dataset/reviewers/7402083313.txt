15944392517	Non-probabilistic reliability convex model method for stability analysis of surrounding rock mass of underground structure	In reliability analysis of stability of surrounding rock mass for underground engineering, due to the particular characteristics of physical and mechanical parameters of rock mass, the variation interval of these parameters can only be obtained based on rock mass classification, while it is very difficult to obtain probability density function and subjection function of these parameters for rock mass. Therefore, the stability and reliability of surrounding rock mass, calculated by traditional probabilistic statistics model and fuzzy probability model, only has theoretical significance. Based on the characteristics of surrounding rock mass of underground engineering, the convex model is adopted to simulate uncertainties of rock mass parameters and to change state equation into affine function. For the underground structure with specified design safety margin, the response output interval of structure can be calculated through affine function whose independent variable is defined in convex set. The stability and reliability of the surrounding rock mass of underground structure can be determined by comparing design safety interval with response output interval. For the underground structure without design safety margin, non-probabilistic stability reliability index is defined through the analysis of ratio of average value in limit state equation to its deviation on convex set. Probability density function and subjection function need not be fitted in non-probability convex model methods. Therefore, non-probability convex model methods need less information than traditional stability reliability analysis method. The analysis results of non-probability methods are more accurate than that of traditional method. The results of engineering analysis show the convex model method of non-probabilistic reliability is feasible.

Based on an analysis of the shear deformation characteristics and mechanism of structural planes and interfaces, a shear damage model reflecting the characteristics of residual strength after failure is established by analyzing the micro-mechanical shear element of the structural planes and interfaces. In this model, the shear element is divided into two parts: damaged material and undamaged material, the shear load is supported by the two parts together, and the damaged material provides bearing capability for residual strength. According to a comprehensive analysis method for shear element strength, a new statistical damage evolvement model is developed by introducing the statistical damage theory and assuming Weibull distribution for the strength of shear element. A new statistical damage constitutive model for simulating the shear deformation of structural planes and interfaces is established, which could not only well reflect the characteristics of strain-softening of structural planes and interfaces, but also describe the impact of normal stress and reflect the deformation characteristics of residual strength. The model is proven to be reasonable and feasible by comparison with experimental results and existing similar models.

84863085479	A statistical damage constitutive model for softening behavior of rocks	A basic theory of damage mechanics was introduced to deal with the deformation of strain softening for rocks. In this theory, a statistical method was used to describe rock properties on a mesoscopic scale in order to generate realistic behavior at a macroscopic scale. First, some relevant concepts of damage mechanics theory were summarized. This summary was followed by the concise presentation of a damage model established for rocks. Subsequently, the effect of the damage threshold on the evolution of rock damage was analyzed based on this damage model. An evolution equation of the damage for rocks was then formulated by incorporating statistical considerations, as it underlies a corresponding method of measuring the mesoscopic element strength in characterizing the influence of the damage threshold. A statistical damage constitutive model for rocks was further proposed whereby the phenomenon of strain softening can be reflected. A simple, yet practical procedure for identifying the model parameters was provided and an associated flow for solving this constitutive model was also presented. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed constitutive model, comparative analyses between experimental data and theoretical results were offered using the illustrative examples, and the discussions on several issues related to the rock behavior of this model were eventually performed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865304754	Combination evaluation method for classification of surrounding rock quality of tunnel based on drifting degree	Considering the inconsistency among the evaluation results drawn by different classification methods for surrounding rock quality of tunnels, combination evaluation idea is introduced. A model for classification of surrounding rock quality based on combination evaluation is formulated by selecting several existing classification methods for surrounding rock quality of tunnels as the fundamental methods, which may integrate the advantages of the fundamental methods.

84888126819	Large-scale direct shear tests on soil-rock aggregate mixture under complicated environment based on orthogonal design	In order to study the strength characteristics of soil-rock aggregate mixture under complex environment more systematically and comprehensively, a series of lab large-scale direct shear tests are conducted through Geotest direct shear apparatus based on the orthogonal experimental design. These tests take into account variable factors such as water content, soaking time, wetting/drying cycles, stone content, rock property and soil property, etc. Then the degree of influence of these factors on the shear strength of soil-rock aggregate mixture is determined, which can provide a new way for this kind of multi-factor and multi-level researches. The test results indicate that the shear strength of soil-rock aggregate mixture is caused by mutual embedding, mesh and friction of aggregated rock. The rock content is the single primary factor for influencing the strength property of rock-soil aggregate mixture. With the increase of the rock content in the test specimen, the internal friction angle increases linearly. In 3 kinds of varied water effect situations, the water content has the most significant impact on the strength of soil-rock aggregate mixture. It also has high influence on the shape of shear stress-shear displacement curve. In contrast, the soaking time and wetting/drying cycles are less important for the shear strength of rock-soil aggregate mixture, and the shear strength will not continue to weaken when the specimen is soaked for more than 48 hours or under 4 wetting/drying cycles. The shear strength of the specimen is obviously affected by the rock property when its rock content is not less than 55%.
