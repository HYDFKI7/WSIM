84938524385	Nutrient characteristics of effluents from manure digesters in the U.S. and China	Anaerobic digestion converts manure into a more stable and nutrient-rich material as well as generates renewable energy. The characteristics of nutrients in manure digester effluents are not only affected by digester feedstock, but also by digester designs and operations. Anaerobic digestion technologies applied in the agricultural sector in the U.S. and China have distinguished differences in terms of digester feedstock, anaerobic processes, fermentation temperatures, and operational procedures. However, little has been known about the effects of these factors on nutrient characteristics of digester effluents in the two countries. This paper presents methodologies and results of two research projects sponsored by the US. EPA and China Agriculture University to characterize nutrients in manure digester feedstock and effluent. The study was based on three data sets that were (1) sampling and analysis of feedstock and effluents at three manure digester systems for one year in the Midwest, USA, (2) sampling and analysis of effluents from three manure digesters in Beijing China, and (3) effluent analysis data from 32 digesters in China reported in the literature. Physical and chemical characteristics of digester effluents properties such as total dry solids, pH, NH<inf>4</inf>+-N, TKN, total phosphorus (TP), and metals were compared. Effluents from digesters in both countries had high NH4+-N concentrations and pH values, but differed greatly in TP and metal concentrations. These differences might be related to the variations in feedstock, digestion technologies, digester operations, and sample analysis methods in the two countries.

The mobilization of storage nutrients and relevant hydrolase activity were studied. Although the final germination rates were similar, the obtained seedlings from presoaking treatments with BS had heavier wet weights and longer roots than those from the control, and more seminal roots were developed. Presoaking with BS promoted the mobilization of storage nutrients by improving hydrolase activity. The amylase activities increased significantly by 3.9%-20.0%. The protease activities increased significantly by 19.9%-31.8%. Correspondingly, more soluble sugar was detected. The synthesis of soluble protein was also promoted. For presoaking treatments with BS, superoxide dismutase activities increased by 7.8%-13.0%, but catalase and peroxidase activities varied. Overall, seedlings from maize seeds presoaked with BS showed better growth potential and physiological properties compared with those from seed presoaked with distilled water. However, further investigations are needed because of the complicated mechanism of seed germination and the complex composition of BS.

33847407987	Preliminary study on one-dimensional dynamic cool storage in a preservation system with natural cool resource	The nature of glacial dynamic refrigeration is heat conduction in companion with the release and absorption of latent heat. The heat transfer rule is the key to large-scale ice making, while few were reported in the literature about thermodynamic analysis in preservation system with natural cool resources. The authors studied glacial thickness fluctuant curve with simplified test device and took heat transfer into account. In theory, the authors developed the complete mathematical model and indicated that the sum of thermal and latent heat flux between water and ice layer was equal to the heat of convection between ice and environment. In comparison with experimental curve, the theoretical model can reveal the real process of one-dimensional dynamic cool storage of ice. Simulating three-dimensional dynamic refrigeration should be considered in the further study.

84861653759	Performance of lab-scale tidal flow constructed wetlands treating livestock wastewater	The body of knowledge on the performance of tidal flow constructed wetlands treating strong wastewaters like livestock wastewater is insufficient. Experiments on three laboratory-scale tidal flow constructed wetlands with different operational strategies were carried out to investigate the performance, regarding the removal of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus in livestock wastewater. Results demonstrated that the removal of total organic carbon averaged about 70% under varying influent concentration. The findings demonstrated a change from 290 mg/L to 1500 mg/L in three wetlands with flood drain ratios of 1 h:3 h, 3 h:3 h, 6 h:6 h, respectively. There was no significant difference in TOC removal between the experimental phases with different organic load and flood drain ratio. The removal of ammonium was particularly impactful to the flood drain ratio with results that achieved 59% (flood drain ratio 1 h:3 h), 65% (3 h:3 h) and 71% (6 h:6 h), respectively. The presence of nitrate (180 mg/L) in the effluent indicated enhanced nitrification process in tidal wetland due to its high capacity of oxygen transfer. The removal of phosphorus was exhibited to be 35% which was mainly adsorbed to the matrix. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The APS system comprised of four hydrolysis digesters and one biogasification reactor. The hydrolysis reactors were operated batchwised at a 12-day retention time, while the biogasification reactor was continuously operated at different hydraulic retention times (HRT). The biogas and methane yields from green waste were determined to be 0.438 and 0.252 L/g volatile solid (VS), respectively, with VS removal of 78%. The biogas and methane yields from food waste were 0.596 and 0.379 L/g VS, respectively, with VS removal of 85%. Hydrogen was produced from hydrolysis reactors during the digestion of food waste. Its content was 30.1% and 8.5% of the biogas produced on the first and second day of digestion, respectively. Hydrogen yield from the whole system was determined to be 0.029 L/g VS representing about 4.9% of the total biogas production from the system. The ratio between the volumes of biogasification and hydrolysis reactors (BR/HR) was found to be a factor that affects the process performance and stability. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84877827551	Thermal modelling of the completely stirred anaerobic reactor treating pig manure at low range of mesophilic conditions	Most of Chinese middle size agricultural biogas plants run at the lower range of mesophilic conditions and low organic loading rates (OLRs) which result in the low biogas production. How to obtain an economically viable operation mode is a challenge for Chinese farm biogas plants. In this study, the performance of completely stirred anaerobic reactors treating pig manure was studied at 20, 28 and 38°C. A thermal mathematic model was accordingly developed to decide the optimum digesting temperature and OLRs considering ambient temperature of 20, 10 and 0°C.

Alkalinity is a key indicator for measuring buffering capacity of the fermentation substrate, so its online monitoring should be enhanced to keep the anaerobic fermentation process stable automatically. An online monitoring system based on joint titration of alkalinity and VFA was designed. The software system was introduced in detail. The system could determine alkalinity and VFA simultaneously, which achieved real-time curve display and pH meter calibration. Moreover, automatic analysis could be realized. The experiment results showed that the system had the ability of the rapid determination of alkalinity and VFA in the fermentation process. The relative standard deviation was less than 5%, which was lower than the manual titration and indicated a high measurement accuracy of the proposed system.

84887297066	Effect of white-rot fungi pretreatment on methane production from anaerobic digestion of corn stover	The microbial pretreatment of yellow corn stover and corn stover silage was achieved via the solid-state cultivation of white-rot fungi. Pretreatment effects on the biodegradability and subsequent anaerobic production of methane were investigated. The white-rot fungi pretreatment of yellow corn stover was accompanied by 38.3% cellulose, 42.2% hemicellulose, and 39.1% lignin degradation, while the degradation of corn stover silage was 9.9% cellulose, 23.2% hemicellulose, and 15.2% lignin. The reducing sugar yield of pretreatment yellow corn stover and corn stover silage after enzymatic hydrolysis was 195.8 mg/g and 67.7 mg/g respectively. These indicated much more composition of yellow corn stover was degradated, and more available composition retained in the corn stover silage after pretreated.The results showed that the total VS methane production of pretreated corn stover silage was 215.5 mL/g after 21 d anaerobic digestion, which increased by 29.2% more than the untreated ones and accounting 73.1% for 60 d total methane production. The biogas production of pretreated yellow corn stover was not increased. So microbial pretreatment of corn stover silage by white-rot fungi could increase substrate biodegradability, and further stimulate methane production.

84907878587	Effect of different pretreatment methods on sewage sludge anaerobic digestion	With the widely use of biological wastewater treatment, a large number of sewage sludge (SS) was produced in the process. The treatment of SS has become a major challenge for wastewater treatment plants. Landfill and incineration as traditional methods of sludge treatment not only pollute the environment but also consume a lot of energy. Anaerobic digestion as a sustainable sludge treatment method benefits environmental protection and energy saving. However, traditional anaerobic digestion of sludge treatment has the characters of low efficiency, poor biodegradability and long residence time. Therefore, in order to improve the efficiency of anaerobic digestion of SS, the pretreatments are paid more and more attention. According to the physical and chemical properties and the anaerobic digestion of sludge characteristics, this study assessments the different mechanisms of various sludge pretreatment methods. Simultaneously, different types of sludge pretreatment were classified. And the effects of different types of sludge pretreatment on the characteristics of anaerobic digestion of sludge were compared further. Moreover, the influence factors of different sludge anaerobic digestion treatment were evaluated deeply. Besides, the problems of anaerobic sludge digestion and the direction for the future development of anaerobic sludge digestion were briefly analyzed.

55049091748	Moisture distribution in a rice kernel during tempering drying	The intra-kernel moisture content profiles are important in understanding the effect of tempering process on the moisture content gradient and rice fissuring. Intermittent drying of long-grain (var. L201) and short-grain (var. Akitakomachi) rough rice was performed and the moisture content distributions within a rice kernel were estimated by a simplified sphere drying model. The results showed that the model was capable of accurately simulating drying and tempering processes of grain. Moisture content gradients were produced during drying periods, which remarkably decreased at the early stage of tempering processes and then decreased gradually. Tempering at 50 °C for 120 min removed about 80% of the moisture content gradients created in a rice kernel during drying. Moreover, moisture contents of the internal layers of the kernels always decreased in the whole intermittent drying while that of the outer layers of the kernels decreased during the drying periods and increased during the tempering periods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

67650229585	Effect of feed to inoculum ratios on biogas yields of food and green wastes	Biogas and methane yields of food and green wastes and their mixture were determined using batch anaerobic digesters at mesophilic (35 ± 2 °C) and thermophilic (50 ± 2 °C) temperatures. The mixture was composed of 50% food waste and 50% green waste, based on the volatile solids (VS) initially added to the reactors. The thermophilic digestion tests were performed with four different feed to inoculum (F/I) ratios (i.e., 1.6, 3.1, 4.0 and 5.0) and the mesophilic digestion was conducted at one F/I (3.1). The results showed that the F/I significantly affected the biogas production rate. At four F/Is tested, after 25 days of thermophilic digestion, the biogas yield was determined to be 778, 742, 784 and 396 mL/g VS for food waste, respectively; 631, 529, 524 and 407 mL/g VS for green waste, respectively; and 716, 613, 671 and 555 mL/g VS for the mixture, respectively. About 80% of the biogas production was obtained during the first 10 days of digestion. At the F/I of 3.1, the biogas and methane yields from mesophilic digestion of food waste, green waste and their mixture were lower than the yields obtained at thermophilic temperature. The biogas yields were 430, 372 and 358 mL/g VS, respectively, and the methane yields were 245, 206, and 185 mL/g VS, respectively. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

70450224860	Effect of drying and tempering on rice fissuring analysed by integrating intra-kernel moisture distribution	The fissure generation of one short- and two long-grain rough rice dried at different air conditions for 15, 30 and 60 min, and respectively, tempered at 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C for tempering duration ranging from 0 to 330 min was analysed by integrating moisture gradients in rice kernels. Results indicated that drying and tempering processes had significant effects on the moisture gradient and rice fissuring. The percentage of fissured kernels increased with increasing drying time and decreasing tempering time. The tempering duration required for long-grain rice was shorter than that for short-grain rice to prevent kernel fissuring. Higher tempering temperatures can effectively eliminate moisture gradients and then lower the rice fissuring generation. Tempering at 50 °C reduced fissuring incidence by 32 to 50% compared to tempering at 20 °C. Moreover, short-grain rough rice was very susceptible to fissure whereas long-grain rough rice with a high amylose content was much more fissure-tolerance. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to increase volumetric gas production rate, High gravimetric solid fermentation is becoming a hot focus for research, the difficulty is how to increase the solid content of fermenter substrates, at the same time, the amount of gas is not decreased. In this paper, we select pig manure, cow manure and chicken manure, and do experiment with the temperature at 35°, the initial pH at 7, and 4 solid contents. We can determine every process figure and capacity in order to determine the optimal solid content. The results show that as the solid content increases, the conversion rate of TS, VS, TCOD, and SCOD decreases. Through comparative analysis, the optimal solid content of chicken manure ranges 6% to 8%, and the cow manure and pig manure are about 10%. © 2011 IEEE.

Acidification with a pH of 3.0 was detected under an organic carbon load of 100 mg/day, which further inhibited the activity of the denitrification process. With an increase in the carbon load to 240 mg/day, the pH was significantly elevated to 6.0. However, a negative effect of sulphide as a product of sulphate reduction was observed on the removal of ammonium, the plants (Juncus effusus), and the organic carbon degradation. With a produced sulphide concentration of about 3.5 mg/L, the ammonium removal decreased from 100% to 30% under an inflow load of 100 mg/day, and the number of healthy stalks of J. effuses was reduced from about 14 000/m

The temporal and spatial dynamics of pore-water sulphide, Fe(II) and phosphate concentrations in the wetland beds were characterized and the seasonal effects on sulphide production and nitrification inhibition were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the pore-water sulphide concentrations gradually increased from less than 0.2 mg/L in 2005 to annual average concentrations of 15 mg/L in 2010, while the pore-water Fe(II) concentrations decreased from 35.4 mg/L to 0.3 mg/L. From 2005 to 2010, the phosphate removal efficiency declined from 91% to 10% under a relatively constant inflow concentration of 5 mg/L. The pronounced effect of plants was accompanied by a higher sulphate reduction and ammonium oxidation in the planted bed, as compared to the unplanted control. A high tolerance of plants towards sulphide toxicity was observed, which might be due to the detoxification of sulphide by oxygen released by the roots. However, during the period of 2009-2010, the nitrification was negatively impacted by the sulphide production as the reduction in the removal of ammonium from 75% to 42% (with inflow concentration of 55 mg/L) correlated with the increasing mean annual sulphide concentrations. The effect of the detoxification of sulphide and the immobilization of phosphate by the application of the iron-rich soil matrix in the initial years was proven; however, the life-span of this effect should not only be taken into consideration in further design but also in scientific studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The experimental results showed that the optimum fermentation conditions of Th3 were as follows: initial pH was 7.0-8.0, sequence of three bacteria inoculation was ZQ-1, ZY-3 and CD-2, inoculation ratio was 1:2:1, and inoculum was 6% of effective volume. At the same time, the acetic acid yield was observed as high as 0.65 g/(L·d) at 30°C with static culture. The metabolic process of Th3 was proved to be very stable within ten generations. At(26±1)°C, the daily biogas production and productivity were improved significantly after Th3 addition in the initial and medium fermentation, and the start-up phase was shortened by 2-3 days. But the biogas process had no significant change when Th3 was added at the late stage of fermentation. The research can provide a reference for the complex strains construction, anaerobic digestion efficiency improvement and optimization of fermentation process and has an application value in biogas production.

The carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emission from three classical household biogas plants in China were analyzed. Considering the greenhouse gases emissions in life cycle of household biogas plants, the main emission processes were investigated to be the utilization of biogas, such as biogas combustion use and transportation of materials which both accounting for more than 98%. The greenhouse gases emissions in the stages of methane leakage and construction materials production were only estimated to be 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively. As comparing to the meandering fabric digester and the precast reinforced concrete panels fabricated digester, the in-situ concrete cylindrical water pressure digester showed the lowest carbon footprint and accordingly most potential for the reduction of greenhouse gases emission. It tried to analyze three household biogas plants' carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emission during the stages. It can provide the basis for optimization low-carbon proposal and the analysis and built up a simple carbon footprint calculation model. About household digesters life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, the main emission process are biogas utilization period and transport phase , accounting for more than 98.38 percent , followed by methane leak stage and building materials production stage, about 1.11% and 0.51%.Compared to meandering fabric type digesters and precast reinforced concrete panels fabricated digesters, in-situ concrete cylinder shaped hydraulic digester's carbon footprint is minimum so greenhouse gas emission reduction potential is great. © 2012 IEEE.

However, the reported coefficients have a significant difference. The relationship of dairy feedstock intake and its pollutant production were analyzed on the basis of previous studies on pollutant generation coefficients of Holstein and a model of pollutants generation coefficients in dairy production was suggested and verified. The amount of feces excreted by bred cattle could be predicted by four factors of feed intake, intake of nitrogen, intake of phosphorus and intake of copper. And the results fit the model better than that of the dairy cow. The nitrogen content in the feces of bred cattle could be predicted by intake of feed and nitrogen. The nitrogen content in the feces of dairy cattle could be predicted by intake nitrogen. The phosphorus content in bred cattle and dairy cattle could be predicted both by intake of phosphorus. Considering the impact factors of seasons, samples and location, this model had a wide adaptability which allows to determine the pollution generation coefficients in Holstein dairy production.

An inflow NB load equal to or less than 70. mg/L achieved approximately 95% NB removal regardless of wetland type. When NB influent load increased to 160. mg/L, NB removal efficiency decreased to 57%, 46%, and 33% in planted and unplanted horizontal CWs as well as tidal flow CWs, respectively. Higher NB degradation efficiency in planted horizontal CW highlighted the positive effect of wetland plants. Moreover, strong inhibition of nitrogen removal was initiated in CWs with an increase of NB loads to 160. mg/L, which was probably caused by NB toxicity. The investigation indicated not only the potential application of treatment wetlands as a secondary ecological treatment system for NB-containing wastewater, but also the interactions with nitrogen transformations in CWs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84874345787	Sulphur transformations in constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment: A review	The sulphur-cycle processes inside constructed wetlands (CWs) and their role in the complex network of transformation processes and the long-term stability of wetland systems are still not sufficiently understood. A comprehensive review is accordingly necessary for better understanding to optimize the future design and operation of wetland systems. In this paper, the concept of sulphur cycling in CWs in principle, transformations dynamics of sulphur compounds and their interactions with other element cycles (such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus) and plants, as well as importance for treatment efficiencies are reviewed. The abiotic and biotic transformations of sulphur are both spatially and temporally dynamic in CWs. Next to physico-chemical processes, e.g. mineral precipitation and dissolution, biologically catalyzed redox reactions such as assimilatory and dissimilatory sulphate reduction, as well as oxidation/reduction, and disproportionation of more reduced sulphur compounds also simultaneously occur in the rooted zones of CWs. Moreover, the interactions between sulphur transformations and other processes including microbial transformations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the impact of plants are discussed. Briefly, sulphide as a product of dissimilatory sulphate reduction may remove heavy metals from wastewaters via the precipitation of metal sulphide and the use of CWs in treating heavy metal containing waters (e.g. acid mine drainage) is increasing. However, high sulphide concentrations may also negatively affect growth of wetland plants and microbial activities, especially nitrification, but also influence the mobilization of iron-bound phosphorus. This information may be used to offer future design and operational methodologies that might enhance the performance of contaminants removal and drive a sustainable management of CWs for wastewater treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Biogas projects employing anaerobic digestion and aiming at waste resource utilization are now becoming the most effective and promising techniques used for the treatment of urban waste, industrial wastewater, poultry excreta, and excess sludge from wastewater plants, and so on. In the process, in addition to macronutrients such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulphur (S), trace elements play a crucial role in the growth and metabolism of anaerobic microorganisms. Trace elements such as micro-nutrients are necessary for the metabolism of anaerobic microbes and important components in the anaerobic fermentation enzyme system, which can activate the activity of enzymes in methanogenic systems. Trace elements, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and so on, could promote the growth of the methanogens known to be crucial to the activity of enzymes in methanogenic systems, and to further speed up the biosynthesis of methane. The stimulation and antagonism of trace elements plays a very significant role in the performance and stability of biogas digesters, which are operated with energy crops, animal excreta, crop residues, organic fraction of municipal solid wastes, and other types of organic waste. The deficiency or unavailability of these elements in biogas digesters is probably the first reason of poor process efficiency (fermentation system operation instability and declining gas production) without any other obvious reason, despite proper management and control of other operational and environmental parameters. This paper reviews the biological effects of trace elements, methanogens demand for trace elements and the role of trace elements in methane synthesis on one hand, and the research status at home and abroad about the influence of trace elements such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), and so on, on anaerobic fermentation on the other hand. Trace elements Fe, Co, and Ni can improve the efficiency of conversion of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and eliminate the phenomenon of the accumulation of VFA. They also could antagonize the inhibitory effect induced by sodium ions, ammonia nitrogen, and increase the methane yield and keep the stability of anaerobic digestion process. Through review, the effects of trace elements on anaerobic fermentation may help to maintain the operational stability of the biogas project. Further, such knowledge is indispensable for a rational dosage of these metals to ensure maximum, high solid substrate conversion rates and to prevent disturbances in reactor performance using a minimum amount of metals. Additionally, understanding the potential environmental risks due to adding trace elements is currently insufficient.

84880658875	Influence of nitrate load on sulfur transformations in the rhizosphere of Juncus effusus in laboratory-scale constructed wetlands treating artificial domestic wasewater	Two laboratory-scale constructed wetlands planted with Juncus effusus were used to investigate the effect of nitrate load on the sulfur transformation dynamics related to the removal of organic carbon and ammonium. Organic carbon was removed at a constant high mean level of 80% (inflow of 25 mg/L total organic carbon), irrespective of the nitrate load. In contrast, sulfate reduction responded immediately to the presence or absence of nitrate in an opposing manner, indicating a high abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria along with an inhibitory effect of nitrate on sulfur reduction. In general, sulfate reduction as well as nitrate reduction were at relatively high mean levels of 70% (inflow of 10 mg/L SO

84881385887	Effect of biogas slurry on yield increase, quality improvement, water and soil environment	This paper comprehensively summarized the research results from domestic and foreign studies of the effect of biogas slurry farmland application on plants yield and quality, and the effect on water and soil environment. It showed that biogas slurry played a positive role in improving the quality and yield of crops, improving plant seed germination, prevention and treatment of plant diseases and insect pests, and improving soil quality. However, an excess amount of biogas slurry application could lead to the pollution risks of water and soil environment. It should fully consider the land carrying capacity for biogas slurry and choose appropriate dosage which had no pollution on soil and groundwater, so that the demand of fertilizer could be saved and the production cost of farmers could be reduced. It could provide scientific guidance for biogas project handling biogas slurry.

84881514695	Yield and characteristics of pyrolysis products obtained from Schizochytrium limacinum under different temperature regimes	Pyrolysis-gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) was used to determine the yield and chemical composition of the pyrolysis products of Schizochytrium limacinum. The pyrolysis was carried out by varying the temperature from 300 °C to 800 °C. It was found that the main decomposition temperature of Schizochytrium limacinum was 428.16 °C, at which up to 66.5% of the mass was lost. A further 18.7% mass loss then occurred in a relatively slow pace until 760.2 °C due to complete decomposition of the ash content of Schizochytrium limacinum. The pyrolysis of Schizochytrium limacinum at 700 °C produced the maximum yield (67.7%) of pyrolysis products compared to 61.2% at 400 °C. While pollutants released at 700 °C (12.3%) was much higher than that of 400 °C (2.1%). Higher temperature will lead to more pollutant (nitrogen compounds and PAHs) release,which is harmful to the environment. Considering the reasonably high yield and minimum release of pollutants, a lower pyrolysis temperature (400 °C) was found to be optimum for producing biofuel from Schizochytrium limacinum. © 2013 by the authors.

84882943219	Effects of organic loading rate and effluent recirculation on the performance of two-stage anaerobic digestion of vegetable waste	The effects of organic loading rates (OLR) and effluent recirculation on dynamics of acidogenic and methanogenic processes in two-stage anaerobic digestion of vegetable waste were investigated. Two systems were performed at OLRs of 1.3, 1.7, 2.1 and 2.6. g. VS/L/d. One system recirculated the effluent from the methanogenic reactor to acidogenic reactor. With increasing OLRs, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration increased to approximately 8500. mg/L in acidogenic digester, where pH decreased from 6.4 to 5.2. Daily biogas production and methane content in methanogenic reactor increased from 1.2 to 4.4. L/d and from 27.4% to 60.5%, respectively. However, inhibition of hydrolysis in acidogenic reactor was demonstrated under the OLR of 2.6. g. VS/L/d without recirculation, thus indicating system overloading. Effluent recirculation shown a considerable positive effect on alleviating VFA inhibition and improving biogas production in acidogenic reactor because of the effect of dilution and pH adjustment, particularly at high OLRs. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84884780641	Key factors of thermal efficiency test protocols for household biomass cookstoves	In this paper, three typical test methods for thermal efficiency of biomass stoves were discussed. The effect factors such as operation process, test ending time, pot sizes, amount of water on the thermal efficiency of domestic biomass cookstoves were studied. The results show that the test ending time and the amount of water used have major impacts on thermal efficiency. The amount of water is in positive correlation with the thermal efficiency of the stove (R=0.92) when the heat needed for the selected amount of water is less than actual power output of stoves. The thermal efficiency is more controllable and accurate when the test ending time is 2°C lower than the boiling point and the amount of water is selected according to the actual power output of stoves. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884926688	Use of solid digestate as a growing medium for tomato seedlings	The aim of this investigation was to evaluate solid digestate as a growing substrate for plug seedlings. Four mediums prepared from solid digestate, vermiculite, perlite and activated carbon were used to determine optimum growing substrate for tomato seedlings (Zhongshu six). The substrate used in this study mixed as solid digestate: vermiculite: perlite: activated carbon were (m:m): 4:13:2:1, 8:9:2:1, 12:5:2:1 and 16:1:2:1, respectively. Besides, peat: vermiculite of 2:1 (v:v) was used as the control. Various seedling indices were measured to assess the quality of the substrates. Tomato seedlings grown in solid digestate: vermiculite: perlite: activated carbon of 16:1:2:1 (m:m) displayed the best quality compared with all the other treatments, due to a correct balance between the digestate nutrient supply and the physical properties provided by vermiculite, perlite and activated carbon. Solid digestate could be a potential alternative for plug seedlings. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

One-phase and two-phase anaerobic digestion process were investigated in continuous stirred-tank reactor with hydraulic retention times 15 days (hydrolysis and acidification for 3 days and methanogenic12 days in two-phase). When the organic loading rates were equal to or less than 4 g VS/L day, the biogas yield and volumetric production of two processes were no significant difference. However, in the case of organic loading rates being equal to or higher than 5.0 g VS/L day, two-phase biogas yield and volumetric biogas production averaged 0.294 L CH

84885033799	Titration method for total inorganic carbon and volatile fatty acids determination in anaerobic digestion	In order to obtain a simple and reliable method for volatile fatty acid concentration and bicarbonate alkalinity, Nordmann titration method and instrument method were chosen in lab-scale CSTRs for chicken manure. The accuracy was compared and correction of titration method was made. The result showed that the Nordmann titration method and instrument method for VFA and TIC concentration determination were significant difference, and the mean relative error was more than 50%. After correction, the mean relative error was significantly reduced and lower than 10% when the organic load was higher than 4.0 g/(L·d). It means that the modified titration method could achieve more simple and accurate determination of VFA and TIC concentration. Also, as the total VFA concentration measured by the modified titration method had a good correlation with the acetic acid concentration measured by gas chromatography, the modified titration method could estimate the acetic acid concentration. Compared to pH value, VFA/TIC ratio measured by modified titration method could realize early warning of acidification.

84889253281	Effect of trace elements on anaerobic digestion of food waste	For the low efficiency and instability of anaerobic digestion of food waste, the effect of trace elements including iron, cobalt, nickel, selenium, molybdenum and tungsten on anaerobic digestion of food waste was investigated under mesophilic condition (37±1)°C using CSTR reactors. The results showed that when hydraulic retention time was 40 d, organic loading rate was 3 g/(L·d), daily methane yield of the reactor with trace elements and control reactor reached to 7.1 L/d and 6.7 L/d, respectively. The methane concentration in two reactors was 62.7% and 61.6%, respectively. When organic loading rate increased to 4 g/(L·d), the methane concentration of the control reactor decreased to 19.5%. However, it could keep stable at around 60% in the reactor with trace elements. Moreover, pH value in the control reactor dropped to 5.24 rapidly which demonstrated the failure of anaerobic digestion process, but it could perform stably at around 7.2 in the reactor with trace elements. A conclusion could be easily drawn that trace elements could improve the methane production efficiency and stability of anaerobic digestion process of food waste under the investigated conditions.

84897471272	Development of constructed wetlands inperformance intensifications for wastewater treatment: A nitrogen and organic matter targeted review	The knowledge on the performance enhancement of nitrogen and organic matter in the expanded constructed wetlands (CWs) with various new designs, configurations, and technology combinations are still not sufficiently summarized. A comprehensive review is accordingly necessary for better understanding of this state-of-the-art-technology for optimum design and new ideas. Considering that the prevailing redox conditions in CWs have a strong effect on removal mechanisms and highly depend on wetland designs and operations, this paper reviews different operation strategies (recirculation, aeration, tidal operation, flow direction reciprocation, and earthworm integration), innovative designs, and configurations (circular-flow corridor wetlands, towery hybrid CWs, baffled subsurface CWs) for the intensifications of the performance. Some new combinations of CWs with technologies in other field for wastewater treatment, such as microbial fuel cell, are also discussed. To improve biofilm development, the selection and utilization of some specific substrates are summarized. Finally, we review the advances in electron donor supply to enhance low C/N wastewater treatment and in thermal insulation against low temperature to maintain CWs running in the cold areas. This paper aims to provide and inspire some new ideas in the development of intensified CWs mainly for the removal of nitrogen and organic matter. The stability and sustainability of these technologies should be further qualified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84899056130	Performance of two-stage vegetable waste anaerobic digestion depending on varying recirculation rates	Vegetable waste, which characterized by high moisture content, was evaluated as a substrate for biogas production. The effects of recirculation rate (RR) on the performance of two-stage anaerobic digestion were investigated. The system was operated at an organic loading rate of 1.7. g. VS/L/d with varying RRs (0, 0.6, 1, and 1.4). Results demonstrated that volumetric biogas production rates in acidogenic reactor increased from approximately 0.27. L/L/d to 0.97. L/L/d, when pH is increased from approximately 5.1 to 6.7. These indicate that recirculation of alkaline effluent from the methanogenic reactor helps create a favorable condition for biogas production in the acidogenic reactor. The decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations from approximately 21,000. mg/L to 6800. mg/L was also observed in the acidogenic reactor. This condition may be attributed to dilution under recirculation. The dynamics between hydrolysis and methanogenesis under recirculation indicated that mass transfer capacity between two-stage reactors improved. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84900513588	Batch anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure with dewatered sewage sludge under mesophilic conditions	The objective of this study was to investigate the characteristic of anaerobic co-digestion of pig manure (PM) with dewatered sewage sludge (DSS). The batch experiment was conducted under mesophilic (37±1°C) conditions at five different PM/DSS volatile solid (VS) ratios of 1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 0:1. The batch test evaluated the methane potential, methane production rate of the PM co-digestion with DSS at different mixing ratios. The first-order kinetic model and modified Gompertz model were also introduced to predict the methane yield and evaluate the kinetic parameters. The optimum mixing ratio of PM with DSS was 2:1 and the cumulative methane yield (CMY) was 315.8mL/gVS

84901238674	Application of bioaugmentation in anaerobic digestion	The application of bioaugmentation techniques in anaerobic fermentation was reviewed in term of mechanisms, effects and influencing factors of the bioaugmentation process. It reveals that bioaugmentation has positive effects on anaerobic fermentation, such as in feedstock pretreatment, anaerobic digestion processes start up and biogas produce. However, most of the existing researches were conducted in laboratory scale and batch assays. The focal point of bioaugmentation process is the survival and activity of functional microorganisms in the fermentation system. There are still a series of problems that need to be solved to increase the success of bioaugmentation strategies widely using in actual engineering, such as revealing the interrelationship of the inoculated microbial culture and existing microflora, developing stable and adaptable functional microbial agents, seeking better ways of bioaugmentation performance, establishing evaluation criteria of the bioaugmentation effects.

84903625028	Key differences of performance test protocols for household biomass cookstoves	In this study, different ways of testing household biomass cooking stoves are compared and analyzed. The differences between test methods relate to the stove operation and data analysis methods, the fueling procedure, the end point selection, the choice of metrics and others factors. The influences of these differences were analyzed by using an induction heater. The results show the use of a pot lid or not, and the selection of the end point of the test have the greatest influence on the rated performance. Consequently test results provided by laboratories using different test methods will place the same stove-plus-fuel combination on significantly different performance 'tiers'. Also the results show some metrics in popular tests should be reviewed. Some recommendations are provided for improving the accuracy and repeatability of test procedures and select metrics are defined for greater clarity. © 2014 The Cape Peninsula University of Technology.

Effects of washing of corn stover silage (WCSS) on the lignocellulosic biodegradability in the fungal pretreatment step and on methane production in the AD step were investigated with comparison to the CSS. It was found that P. chrysosporium had the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin of CSS up to 19.9, 32.4, and 22.6 %, respectively. Consequently, CSS pretreated by 25 days achieved the highest methane yield of 265.1 mL/g volatile solid (VS), which was 23.0 % higher than the untreated CSS. However, the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin in WCSS after 30 days of SSF increased to 45.9, 48.4, and 39.0 %, respectively. Surface morphology and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses also demonstrated that the WCSS improved degradation of cell wall components during SSF. Correspondingly, the pretreatment of WCSS improved methane production by 19.6 to 32.6 %, as compared with untreated CSS. Hence, washing and reducing organic acids (such as lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) present in CSS has been proven to further improve biodegradability in SSF and methane production in the AD step. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The biogas production in co-digested PPF and CM at three volatile solids (VS) ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 was investigated in a series of batch experiments at an organic loading rate of 30.0g VS/L under mesophilic (37±1°C) conditions. The highest daily biogas yield of PPF and CM only, was 90.0mL/g VS<inf>added</inf> at day 12 and 23.4mL/g VS<inf>added</inf> at day 7. For co-digestion of PPF/CM at mixing ratios of 3:1, 1:1 and 1:3, there were 93.6mL/g VS<inf>added</inf> at day 11, 86.8 and 26.4mL/g VS<inf>added</inf> at day 8. VS removal rate for PPF, CM, and co-digestion at mixing ratio of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 were 91.1%, 86.0% and 71.0%, respectively. The anaerobic digestion of PPF and CM and their co-digestion systems were stable in operation with low range of volatile fatty acids (VFA)/TIC (total inorganic carbon) of (0.035-0.091). The main volatile fatty acids were propionic, and iso-butyric acids for PPF, iso-butyric and n-butyric acids for CM. The VFAs and ammonium inhibition were not occurred. The modified Gompertz model can be used to perform a better prediction with a lower difference between the measured and predicted biogas yields. A VS ratio of 3:1 is recommended for practice.

84907385154	Optimization of alkaline flocculation for harvesting of Scenedesmus quadricauda #507 and Chaetoceros muelleri #862	A response surface methodology (RSM) was used to evaluate the effects of pH and microalgal biomass concentration (BC) on alkaline flocculating activity for harvesting one freshwater green algae Scenedesmus quadricauda #507 and one marine diatom Chaetoceros muelleri #862. The pH value and BC were in range of 9.0-12.0 and 0.20-2.30 g/L, respectively. Very high regression coefficient between the variables and the response indicates excellent evaluation of experimental data by second-order regressions. Optimum conditions for flocculating activity were estimated as follows: (i) pH 11.6, BC 0.54 g/L for strain #507 and (ii) pH 11.5, BC 0.42 g/L for strain #862. The maximum flocculating activity was around 94.7% and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of synthetic ocean water (SOW) to the freshwater #507 culture can increase the flocculating activity from 82.13%-88.79% in low algae concentration (0.52 g/L) and 82.92%-95.60% in high concentration (2.66 g/L).

84911446338	The investigation of two stage cultivation on biomass, lipid content and FAME profiles composition capacity of microalgae: Desmodesmus sp. EJ 8-10 in anaerobic digestion wastewater	The microalgae, Desmodesmus sp., is considered to be a promising photoautotrophic biological material for biodiesel with high biomass productivity, lipid and FAME profiles accumulation accompanied by nitrogen and phosphorus removal. This investigation objective was to examine the effects of nutrient repletion on the biomass yield and lipid yield of Desmodesmus sp. in two cultivation stage for their potential capacity in biodiesel production. The results demonstrated that, in stage I, with the consumption of nutrients, the growth rate become slowly. Under the condition of 27°C, 6000 lux illumination, above 99 % and 100% of the ammonia and phosphorus had been removed after 14 and 7 days respectively. In stage II, two seeding size 0.8 g/L and 1.0 g/L of algal growth rate and lipid production were investigated and the highest lipid yield was 370 mg/L at the cultivation time of day 6 in stage II of size 1.0 g/L and related fatty acid methyl ester have been tested. Fatty acid are predominantly composed of palmitoleic (C16:0) and linoleic (C18:2n6c) about 38.20% which are suitable for biodiesel production.

EJ 8-10 in digested and undigested piggery effluents	Microalgae are served as an applicable raw material for biofuels, because of its high lipid content and rapid growth rate. Previous studies have demonstrated that microalgae could grow in kinds of effluents, which can both benefit for the reduction in cost and mitigation in pollution. This study investigated the lipid accumulation of Desmodesmus sp. (EJ 8-10) both in digested and undigested piggery effluents. Different dilution multiples were applied to the digested and undigested piggery effluents and a comparison was conducted regarding the lipid content and lipid productivity. Fatty acid composition analysis was also performed by Gas Chromatography (GC). The consequences showed that lipid content of Desmodesmus sp. (EJ 8-10) ranged from 18.7%∼28.0% in different dilution multiples, and it could get a higher lipid content in digested effluent than in undigested effluent. 5% (v/v) digested piggery effluent has the best promoting effect on lipid productivity, which could reach up to 5.7 mg/L/d. Fatty acid profiles showed that Octadecadienoic acid methyl ester (C18:2) was the most abundant fatty acid in EJ 8-10.
