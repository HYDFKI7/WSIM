0030448783	Endoscopic diagnosis of hookworm disease: Report of two cases	Hookworms usually reside in the small intestine, so they are rarely discovered during routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE). We herein report two cases of hookworm infestation diagnosed by UGIE. One of the two cases combined with gastric adenocarcinoma and no parasite ova was detected in stool examination. Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus can infect humans. In Taiwan, N. americanus is prevalent in the north and the east, and A. duodenale is prevalent in the south and the central region. The infection rate in Taiwan is less than 1%. The adult hookworm resides mainly in the jejunum and may be refluxed toward the duodenum and the stomach during bowel contraction. Endoscopically, hookworms are shining red in color, about 10 mm in length, and a couple of female and male worms usually hug together tightly. There is no report to suggest the relation between hookworm infestation and gastric malignancy in the literature.

0031462889	Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of gallstone ileus: Report of a case	Gallstone ileus is an uncommon mechanical bowel obstruction caused by impaction of one or more gallstones in the intestine. The ileum is involved in about 80% of cases. Difficult and delayed diagnosis and old age of the patients account for its high mortality. We herein report one case with gallstone ileus diagnosed by ultrasound preoperatively in which the patient survived after surgery with only a few complications related to the patient's debilitated medical problems. Emphasis is also put upon how to deal with acute abdomen in elderly patients; in addition to traditional roentgenography, ultrasound may afford a tool to detect gallstone ileus.

2342461143	Development of multifocal duodenal erosions after Anti-Helicobacter pylori triple therapy	Background and Purpose: Anti-Helicobacter pylori triple therapy is effective for healing duodenal ulcer (DU) diseases and reducing disease recurrence. However, multifocal duodenal erosions or shallow ulcers may develop after triple therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and outcome of duodenal erosions that developed after triple therapy. Methods: A total of 106 Taiwanese with active DU and with H. pylori infection were enrolled in this study. All patients received anti-H. pylori triple therapy (i.e., 2 weeks of antimicrobial agents combined with treatment for 4 to 6 weeks with acid suppression agents). Follow-up endoscopy was performed immediately after stopping treatment. The incidence of multifocal erosions or shallow ulcers over the bulb and/or second portion of the duodenum was studied. Additional acid suppression agent was given for 4 weeks whenever duodenal erosions or shallow ulcers were found. Results: Out of 106 patients, 11 (10.4%) were found to have multifocal duodenal erosions and/or shallow ulcers on the duodenal bulb and/or second portion of the duodenum at the end of treatment. Ten of the 11 patients with newly developed erosions had healed DU in the S1 or S2 stage, and all 11 had successful H. pylori eradication. The duodenal erosions and/or shallow ulcers of these 11 patients were healed after an additional 4 weeks of histamine-2-receptor antagonist therapy. Conclusions: Multifocal duodenal erosions and/or shallow ulcers were noted in around 10% of Taiwanese DU patients who received anti-H. pylori triple therapy. An additional 4 weeks therapy with acid suppression agents healed these lesions.

23844551235	Protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on the ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in rats	Aim: To evaluate the preventive effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GbE) on ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injuries in rats. Methods: Female Wistar albino rats were used for the studies. We randomly divided the rats for each study into five subgroups: normal control, experimental control, and three experimental groups. The gastric ulcers were induced by instilling 1 mL 50% ethanol into the stomach. We gave GbE 8.75, 17.5, 26.25 mg/kg intravenously to tie experimental groups respectively 30 min prior to the ulcerative challenge. We removed the stomachs 45 min later. The gastric ulcers, gastric mucus and the content of non-protein sulfhydryl groups (NP-SH), malondialdehyde (MDA), c-Jun kinase (JNK) activity in gastric mucosa were evaluated. The amount of gastric juice and its acidity were also measured. Results: The findings of our study are as follows: (1) GbE pretreatment was found to provide a dose-dependent protection against the ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in rats; (2) the GbE pretreatment afforded a dose-dependent inhibition of ethanol-induced depletion of stomach wall mucus, NP-SH contents and increase in the lipid peroxidation (increase MDA) in gastric tissue; (3) gastric ulcer induced by ethanol produced an increase in JNK activity in gastric mucosa which also significantly inhibited by pretreatment with GbE; and (4) GbE alone had no inhibitory effect on gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats. Conclusion: The finding of this study showed that GbE significantly inhibited the ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats. We suggest that the preventive effect of GbE may be mediated through: (1) inhibition of lipid peroxidation; (2) preservation of gastric mucus and NP-SH; and (3) blockade of cell apoptosis. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

33746412078	A homologue of the Drosophila headcase protein is a novel tumor marker for early-stage colorectal cancer	The altered expression of certain genes is frequently detected as a hallmark of malignant tumors. These differentially expressed genes have the potential to become molecular markers. We purified the fecal mRNA from patients with colorectal cancer to identify novel candidates by using oligonucleotide microarray hybridization. We identified 21 upregulated and 22 downregulated candidates with significantly altered expression in patient fecal samples that have not been previously characterized. A gene encoding a homologue of the Drosophila headcase protein (HECA) was further examined due to its high ranking and possible importance in some human cancers. A tendency towards increased expression of HECA was dependent upon the clinicopathological stage. In this report, healthy individuals expressed less HECA, either in their blood samples or feces. Moreover, we detected upregulated HECA in blood and fecal samples of patients with colorectal cancer, and its expression level was shown to be significantly correlated with disease status. Our data show that HECA may be an early-stage classifier of colorectal cancer that can discriminate between late- and early-stage disease. In conclusion, this study is the first to analyze differentially expressed genes in the feces of colorectal cancer patients using oligonucleotide microarrays. The data suggest that HECA expression levels in feces may be an effective classifier for early-stage colorectal cancer.

33750411520	Debulking surgery for advanced thymoma	Aims: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of debulking surgery in the treatment of locally advanced but operable malignant thymoma. Methods: We reviewed 43 cases with incompletely resected stage III and IVa malignant thymoma managed between January 1987 and December 2002. Results: Twenty-two had stage III and 21 had stage IVa disease. Maximal debulking was performed in 15 patients, nine with stage III and six with stage IVa disease. Nine patients also had myasthenia gravis (MG). Using univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis, we found that maximal debulking surgery, RT, and with the presence of MG were associated with better survival. Debulking resulted in a better outcome than non-debulking surgery (mean survival: 106 months vs 57.2 months). After adjustment with multivariate analysis, RT and MG were both associated with better survival. CT did not appear to be beneficial for advanced thymoma. Conclusions: RT is independently associated with a better outcome in locally advanced thymoma. Debulking surgery apparently allows for a better response to RT. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33846571889	Premedication with pronase of N-acetylcysteine improves visibility during gastroendoscopy: An endoscopist-blinded, prospective, randomized study	Aim: To assess the efficacy of premedicaton with pronase or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 20 min before upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy and to determine whether pronase or NAC pretreatment influences the reliability of the rapid urease test. Methods: A total of 146 patients were prospectively and randomly assigned into the study groups according to different premedications before endoscopy. One endoscopist assessed mucosal visibility (MV) with scores ranged from 1 to 4 at four sites in the stomach. The sum of the MV scores from these four locations was defined as the total mucosal visibility (TMV) score. Identification of H pylori was performed using CLO test, histology, and serology. Results: The Group with pronase premedication had a significantly lower TMV score than did the groups with gascon and gascon water (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). The group with NAC had a significantly lower TMV score than the group with gascon (P < 0.01) and a trend of a lower MV score than the group with gascon water (P = 0.06). The TMV score did not significantly differ between the group with pronase and the group with NAC (P = 0.39 and P = 0.14, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of the CLO test were 92.5% and 93.9%, respectively, in groups premedicated with pronase and NAC together. Conclusion: Premedication with pronase or NAC at 20 min before UGI endoscopy improves the mucosal visibility of the stomach. Neither pronase nor NAC produces any obvious interference with the CLO test for the identification of H pylori infection. © 2007 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

34447342532	Jejunal and multiple mesenteric calcifying fibrous pseudotumor induced jejunojejunal intussusception	We describe here a patient with an unusual presentation - mesenteric calcifying fibrous pseudotumor in association with jejunojejunal intussusception. This 25-year-old woman came to our emergency department with severe abdominal distension and intermittent epigastric cramping pain. She was found to have rebound tenderness and an ill-defined mass palpable in her lower abdomen. Abdominal computed tomography revealed an inhomogeneous soft tissue mass with target sign and intussusception of small intestine was suspected. Emergency laparotomy showed jejunojejunal intussusception involving ∼30 cm of jejunum with multiple tumors on the mesentery surface extending over the whole bowel mesenteric and peritoneal surfaces. One of the mesenteric tumors formed the leading point of the intussusception. Segmental resection of jejunum with primary anastomosis was done. Some larger tumors were resected but most of the other tumors were left in place because they were small and numerous and total resection was impossible. Pathology confirmed that the lesions were benign mesenteric calcifying fibrous pseudotumors. In such patients, surgery might be curative. If a large segment of the bowel is affected by calcifying fibrous pseudotumor, smaller pseudotumors might be left in place because these tend to be asymptomatic. But they might become the leading points of recurrent intussusception. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

34548477700	Esophageal adenocarcinoma arising from Barrett's epithelium in Taiwan	The prevalence of Barrett's esophagus (BE) in Eastern countries is rising to match the prevalence in the West. However, a corresponding trend of BE-associated adenocarcinoma has yet to be observed in Asia. Historically, adenocarcinoma complicating BE has been considered a rare event in Taiwan. In the present report, we collected three Taiwanese cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma arising from BE. The first case was a 37-year-old man with an advanced cancer that developed on pre-existing BE after a 3-year interval without endoscopic surveillance. The second case was a 63-year-old man who presented with odynophagia and was found to have an ulcerative tumor centered on the characteristic Barrett's mucosa. The final case was a 44-year-old man who presented with gradual-onset dysphagia and weight loss, without typical reflux symptom. Our report emphasizes the need for an updated epidemiologic study to determine the incidence of BE-associated adenocarcinoma in Taiwan. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

34548837455	Aloe-emodin-induced apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma cells	The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticancer effect of aloe-emodin, an anthraquinone compound present in the leaves of Aloe vera, on two distinct human gastric carcinoma cell lines, AGS and NCI-N87. We demonstrate that aloe-emodin induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Noteworthy is that the AGS cells were generally more sensitive than the NCI-N87 cells. Aloe-emodin caused the release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochrome c from mitochondria, followed by the activation of caspase-3, leading to nuclear shrinkage and apoptosis. In addition, exposure to aloe-emodin suppressed the casein kinase II activity in a time-dependent manner and was accompanied by a reduced phosphorylation of Bid, a downstream substrate of casein kinase II and a pro-apoptotic molecule. These preclinical studies suggest that aloe-emodin represents a suitable and novel chemotherapeutic drug candidate for the treatment of human gastric carcinoma. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34948825997	Adult intussusception in Asians: Clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment	Background: Adult intussusception is a rare clinical entity. The presentations and optimal management of adult intussusception in Asians have seldom been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine the causes and management of adult intussusception in Taiwan. Methods: A retrospective review performed at four medical centers in Taiwan identified 46 patients, at least 18 years old, with a diagnosis of intestinal intussusception from January 1992 to December 2005. Data related to presentations, diagnosis, treatment, and pathology were analyzed. Results: There were 28 men and 18 women with a mean age of 58 (range 19-83) years. Twenty-five patients were diagnosed with enteric intussusception and 21 patients with colonic intussusception. Disease in 35 (76.1%) patients was caused by a benign lead point. The most common symptom was abdominal pain, which was seen in all patients. Twenty-five patients presented with acute symptoms that they experienced over a period of less than 3 days. The preoperative diagnosis was 89.1% because of the wide use of abdominal computed tomography (CT). The most sensitive diagnostic modality was abdominal CT (88.6%). For all patients, 76% with enteric intussusception and 28.6% with colonic intussusception underwent operative reduction. At the time of writing, 71.7% patients were still alive. Only two patients died of postoperative complications. Conclusions: Most patients with adult intussusception in our series were men, and most intussusceptions were benign and of enteric origin. The most sensitive diagnostic modality is abdominal CT scan. Operative reduction is recommended for enteric intussusceptions but not for colonic intussusceptions. The prognosis of adult intussusception after surgery is good except for malignant intussusception. © 2007 The Authors.

38049055997	A case of human diphyllobothriasis in northern Taiwan after eating raw fish fillets	The consumption of raw fish fillets is increasing in Taiwan. A male Taiwanese aged 30 years presented after passing a flat, white noodle-like worm. Strobila examination showed that most proglottids were wider than they were long, with the genital pore located at the posterior edge of the cirrus. Histological and coprological findings confirmed the diagnosis of Diphyllobothhum latum; ova were ellipsoidal with operculate characteristics, and had a small knob in the anti-operculum side. Hematological data, including vitamin B12 levels, were normal, except for a low folate level. The patient was treated with a single dose of praziquantel 600 mg and 196 cm of proglottids were expelled during the 3 days following treatment. Further follow-up was declined. Consumption of raw and undercooked fish (especially salmon) poses a risk of D. latum infection. © 2007 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

39149100910	Enhanced expression of transforming growth factor-β1 in inflammatory cells, α-smooth muscle actin in stellate cells, and collagen accumulation in experimental granulomatous hepatitis caused by Toxocara canis in mice	Although toxocaral granulomatous hepatitis (TGH) characterized with a dominant-Th2 type immune response is a self-limiting disease, little is known concerning the role of fibrosis-related cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) in pathogenesis of TGH. A detailed histological and quantitatively immunohistochemical analysis of TGF-β1, α-smooth muscle actins (α-SMA), and collagen was performed on the liver tissues from mice infected with Toxocara canis as assessed between day 1 and 42 weeks post-infection (DPI or WPI). TGF-β1 was detected mainly in infiltrating leukocytes in lesions with strong expressions from 4 to 16 WPI. Larvae per se also exhibited strong TGF-β1-like molecule expressions in the trial. Alpha-SMA was detected predominantly in hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which surrounded the lesions with moderate expressions largely throughout the period of the entire experiment. Collagen was observed to accumulate in inflammatory lesions and biliary basement with moderate to strong expressions from 1 WPI onwards in the trial. Since many evidences have indicated that leukocytes have the potential to influence HSC by producing TGF-β1 which can affect HSC to increase collagen synthesis in various liver diseases, we may propose that persistently elevated TGF-β1 expression in infiltrating leukocytes and active HSC with marked α-SMA expressions may contribute to healing of injured sites through up-stimulation of collagen deposition; in contrast, abnormally persistent collagen accumulation may cause irreversible fibrotic injury in the TGH. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34247399083	Large early gastric cancers treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection with an insulation-tipped diathermic knife	It is difficult to remove a large early gastric cancer (≥ 3 cm) in one-piece resection using conventional endoscopic mucosal resection. We tried to use an insulation-tipped (IT) diathermic knife to dissect these lesions. IT-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed in four aging patients with gastric malignancy. All lesions could be removed in one-piece resection by IT-ESD, although three of them exhibited remarkable fibrosis and ulceration. Three cases experienced curative treatment with IT-ESD after the pathologic evaluation, but it was not curative in one case because the pathology showed angiolymphatic invasion. This patient refused additional surgery in consideration of existing major systemic diseases. At 3 months to 1 year of follow-up, endoscopy showed no evidence of residual cancer. IT-ESD is effective in the treatment of large early gastric cancer and is an alternative treatment for early gastric cancer patients who are at risk for major operation. © 2007 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

0034971528	Relationship of duodenal ulcer recurrence to gastric metaplasia of the duodenal mucosa and duodenal bulb deformity	Background and Purpose: This study investigated changes in the severity of gastric metaplasia (GM) of the duodenal mucosa before and after ulcer healing and Helicobacter pylori eradication. It also investigated whether deformity of the duodenal bulb affects the severity of GM and the likelihood of ulcer recurrence. Methods: Eleven patients were consecutively enrolled in this study. They all had duodenal ulcer(s) and H. pylori infection, for which they had received anti-H. pylori triple therapy during the active ulcer stage, and had all undergone serial endoscopic examinations during both the active ulcer and scarring ulcer stages, and at 1 year after ulcer healing. Duodenal biopsies were obtained at each endoscopy to identify the severity of GM. Duodenal ulcers were divided into three types by bulbar shape and GM was classified into four grades of severity. Results: All 11 patients had increased GM severity just after ulcer healing. The 1-year follow-up study revealed that the GM was unchanged in six of eight patients with grade 3 GM severity at the scarring stage, while in the other two it regressed to grade 1 or 2; these two patients suffered ulcer recurrence. A markedly deformed bulb (type III) was found in three patients, of whom two had ulcer recurrence. Conclusion: Two characteristic conditions were found in patients with duodenal ulcer recurrence after H. pylori eradication: a markedly deformed bulb with grade 3 GM at the scarring stage, and a change in GM from high to low grade at or around the previous ulcer site after ulcer healing.

84861880213	Sleep deprivation impairs Ca2+ expression in the hippocampus: Ionic imaging analysis for cognitive deficiency with TOF-SIMS	Sleep deprivation causes cognitive dysfunction in which impaired neuronal plasticity in hippocampus may underlie the molecular mechanisms of this deficiency. Considering calcium-mediated NMDA receptor subunit 1 (NMDAR1) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation plays an important role in the regulation of neuronal plasticity, the present study is aimed to determine whether total sleep deprivation (TSD) would impair calcium expression, together with injury of the neuronal plasticity in hippocampus. Adult rats subjected to TSD were processed for time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, NMDAR1 immunohistochemistry, nNOS biochemical assay, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, and the Morris water maze learning test to detect ionic, neurochemical, bioenergetic as well as behavioral changes of neuronal plasticity, respectively. Results indicated that in normal rats, strong calcium signaling along with intense NMDAR1/nNOS expression were observed in hippocampal regions. Enhanced calcium imaging and neurochemical expressions corresponded well with strong bioenergetic activity and good performance of behavioral testing. However, following TSD, both calcium intensity and NMDAR1/nNOS expressions were significantly decreased. Behavioral testing also showed poor responses after TSD. As proper calcium expression is essential for maintaining hippocampal neuronal plasticity, impaired calcium expression would depress downstream NMDAR1-mediated nNOS activation, which might contribute to the initiation or development of TSD-related cognitive deficiency. © 2012 Microscopy Society of America.

84877280283	Single-walled carbon nanotube coated antibacterial paper: Preparation and mechanistic study	Development of carbon nanotubes toward commercial antibacterial applications warrants the understanding of their interaction mechanism with bacterial cells. The antibacterial activity and mechanism of acid-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube (AFSWCNT) coated paper was assessed for gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative Escherichia coli models of bacteria. Better activity towards gram-positive bacteria was observed, whereas the presence of an outer membrane makes gram-negative bacteria more resistant to cell membrane damage caused by AFSWCNTs. Based on measured cytoplasmic efflux materials of bacteria, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy-loss spectroscopy imaging studies, we found that the better antibacterial activity of AFSWCNTs toward gram-positive bacteria is attributed to not only direct physical contact and piercing action, but also molecular-scale interaction with surface functional groups of bacteria. The novel antibacterial mechanism of AFSWCNTs might bring a promising strategy to design new antibacterial materials against drug-resistant bacteria species. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

43049120627	Overexpression of protein kinase Cα mRNA may be an independent prognostic marker for gastric carcinoma	Background and Objectives: The variability of the prognosis of gastric carcinoma drives extensive researches for novel prognostic markers. The aims of this study were to correlate the expression of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) mRNA with clinicopathological parameters and to evaluate the significant value of PKCα in gastric carcinoma prognosis. Methods: PKCα mRNA levels were analyzed in tumor/non-tumor pairs of gastric tissues from surgical specimens of 41 patients with gastric carcinoma employing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Expression of PKCα in gastric carcinoma was also examined using immunohistochemistry. Results: PKCα mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in gastric carcinoma (P = 0.007). Overexpression of PKCα mRNA was correlated with distant metastasis (P = 0.040). Patients with high PKCα mRNA expression had a significantly poorer overall survival compared with patients with low PKCα mRNA expression (P = 0.0113). The uni-variate Cox regression analysis showed that high PKCα mRNA expression (P = 0.0363) and depth of invasion (P = 0.0443) were two significant prognostic markers for gastric carcinoma. In backward stepwise multivariate analysis, PKCα mRNA overexpression was also proved to be an independent prognostic marker for gastric carcinoma (P = 0.0275). Conclusions: Our results suggest that overexpression of PKCα mRNA has correlation with distant metastasis and may be an independent prognostic marker for gastric carcinoma. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

50249090433	Liposome encapsulation reduces cantharidin toxicity	Several reports have demonstrated that cantharidin is a strong anticancer compound in vitro; however, its in vivo usefulness is often limited due to its high systemic toxicity. In this study, we encapsulated cantharidin into pegylated liposomes and studied its activity against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in vitro and its systemic toxicity in mice. Another two methods were also used to reduce the dosage of cantharidin, including labeling liposomal cantharidin with octreotide and exposing cells to hyperbaric oxygen. The cytotoxic activity of pegylated liposomal cantharidin was drastically reduced compared with free cantharidin in vitro. Octreotide-labeled pegylated liposomal cantharidin induced cell death by specifically targeting somatostatin receptors in MCF-7 cells. Cell death was augmented with a low dose of cantharidin under hyperbaric oxygen. Liposomal cantharidin had significantly less systemic toxicity than free cantharidin in vivo and also exhibited a high efficacy against antitumor growth in nude mice. These results suggest that the systemic toxicity of cantharidin can be mitigated by liposome encapsulation; however, that did not decrease its antitumor activity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

55149101969	Faecal ribosomal protein L19 is a genetic prognostic factor for survival in colorectal cancer	Ribosomal proteins are encoded by a gene family, members of which are overexpressed in human cancers. Many of them have been found, using oligonucleotide microarray hybridization, to be differentially expressed in the faeces of patients with various stages of col-orectal cancer (CRC). The gene encoding ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19), a prognostic marker for human prostate cancer, is differentially expressed in CRC patients. Measurement of faecal RPL19 mRNA might improve prognostic prediction for CRC patients. Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, levels of RPL19 mRNA were detected in samples of colonic tissues from 44 CRC patients, in the faeces of 54 CRC patients and 15 controls, and in 11 colonic cell lines. Seven of 24 patients with late-stage CRC (Dukes' stages C and D) expressed over 2-fold more RPL19 in colonic tumour tissues than in corresponding normal tissues (P = 0.038). The mean faecal RPL19 mRNA levels of late-staged patients were higher than those of controls (P = 0.003) and early-staged patients (P = 0.008). Patients with both high serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; >5 ng/mL) and high-faecal RPL19 mRNA (≥0.0069) had higher risk (odds ratio, 8.0; P = 0.015) and lower overall 48-month survival (33.8 ± 13.7%, P = 0.013). Oligonucleotide microarray hybridization analysis of faecal molecules identified gene transcripts differentially present in faeces. In conclusion, faecal RPL19 expression is associated with advanced tumour stages and addictive to serum CEA in predicting prognosis of CRC patients. © 2008 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

56749097836	Effect of silymarin on hepatic function of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization	Transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is common treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Silymarin, derived from milk thistle, is widely used internationally for chronic liver disease. Some Taiwanese physicians prescribe silymarin as a hepatoprotective agent after TACE, although there is no evidence on its efficacy in this setting. Retrospectively compare two groups of patient undergoing TACE at our institution: 111 given silymarin postoperatively and 133 who underwent the same procedure and received similar postoperative care but were not given silymarin. The postoperative liver function was evaluated. Patients prescribed silymarin took 280 mg orally daily for two weeks. Liver function tests were checked at baseline and on post-TACE days 2, 4, and 6 and weeks 2-5. Groups were comparable for age, gender, and Child-Pugh class. There were no significant differences between the two groups at different time points in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin and lactate dehydrogenase. Oral silymarin did not accelerate recovery of hepatic function following TACE; there is no basis for its use in this setting.

56749134418	Using ToF-SIMS and EIS to evaluate green pretreatment reagent: Corrosion protection of aluminum alloy by silica/zirconium/cerium hybrid coating	Increasing environmental concern has led to the restrictive use of chromate conversion coatings to protect Al-alloys from corrosion. Our research is under way to find environmentally compliant substitute coating such as Si/Zr/Ce hybrid coating. The corrosion protection effect of green pretreatment reagent consisted of Si-containing base solution, Ce- and Zr-containing sealing solutions on the corrosion protection of Al-alloys was studied with a 3.5% NaCl aqueous testing solution. The correlation between the corrosion resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and surface chemical composition of the hybrid coating measured by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS) was studied. The proposed green pretreatment reagent was found improve the corrosion protection of Al-alloys, presumably due to the formation of protective oxide film acting as an oxygen barrier. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

57849122924	Optimal dose regimens of esomeprazole for gastric acid suppression with minimal influence of the CYP2C19 polymorphism	Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to determine the optimal dosage regimens of esomeprazole for treatment of GERD with minimal influence of the CYP2C19 polymorphism through a study of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of esomeprazole given at 3 different dosage regimens with the same total daily dose. Methods: Each of the 3genotypes of CYP2C19, homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous EMS (hetEMs), and poor metabolizers (PMs) were recruited in this clinical trial. Subjects were given a placebo followed by the administration of esomeprazole, at a dose of 40 mg once daily (40QD), 20 mg twice daily (20TD), or 10 mg 4 times daily (10Q4D) for 7 days. Twenty-four-hour and nocturnal intragastric pH and plasma esomeprazole concentrations were all determined on day 7. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters and dynamic characteristics differed among the 3 CYP2C19 genotype groups. With esomeprazole 40QD, gastric acid suppression was insufficient to achieve a therapeutic effect, while 20TD and 10Q4D were found to be effective in controlling both daytime and nocturnal gastric acidity for all 3 genotype groups. Conclusions: It was confirmed that intragastric pH values and plasma esomeprazole concentrations potentially depended on the CYP2C19 genotype status for treatment with esomeprazole. Dosage regimens of divided doses of 20TD or 10Q4D esomeprazole yielded improved antisecretory effects with a minimal influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

60149088464	Endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric epithelial tumors: A multicenter study in Taiwan	Background/Purpose: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced endoscopic procedure to resect early gastric cancer (EGG). The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness and complications of ESD for gastric epithelial tumors in Taiwan. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and outcome of ESD in patients who received ESD for gastric epithelial tumors between June 2004 and August 2007. Results: A total of 70 patients with gastric epithelial tumors were treated by ESD. The mean age was 66.5± 12.9 years (range, 35-84 years). The mean size of the gastric epithelial tumors was 1.85±0.81 cm. The mean size of resected specimens was 3.26±1.39 cm. The one-piece resection rate was 91.4% (64/70). The median operation time was 92.4 minutes. The complicating bleeding and perforation rates were 5.7% (4/ 70) and 4.3% (3/70), respectively. Emergency surgery was performed for three patients with perforations. The local recurrence rate of gastric cancer was 2.8%. Except for one patient who died of congestive heart failure and another who died of stroke, the remaining 68 patients (97.1%) survived. Conclusion: ESD is a promising local curative treatment option for EGG in Taiwan but it still carries risks of perforation and bleeding. The education and learning curve of endoscopists will improve the outcome of this procedure. ©2009 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

The Taipei City government intended to terminate the E. vermicularis screening program among preschool children. Thus, we were entrusted with confirming whether pinworm infections among preschool children in Taipei City had truly declined. From each of 12 administrative districts 2-3 kindergartens were randomly selected for investigation. In total, 4,349 children were examined, of which 2,537 were boys and 1,812 were girls. The cellophane tape adhered to a glass slide was used, and all examinations were done by certified medical technologists. Results indicated that the overall prevalence rate of pinworm infections was 0.62% (27/4,349). Although the infection rate was higher among boys (0.67%, 17/2,537) than in girls (0.55%, 10/1,812), no significant difference was found (X

70249109667	Osthole, a potential antidiabetic agent, alleviates hyperglycemia in db/db mice	Osthole is an agent isolated from Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cusson and Angelica pubescens and has been used to treat several diseases, including metabolic syndromes. To investigate the hypoglycemic effects of osthole in diabetic db/db mice and the underlying mechanisms of these effects by in vitro assay, diabetic db/db mice and cell experiments were utilized to understand its possible effects. Osthole significantly activated both PPARα and PPARγ in a dose-dependent manner based on the results of the transition transfection assay. The activation of PPARα and PPARγ by osthole also resulted in an increase in the expression of PPAR target genes such as PPAR itself, adipose fatty acid-binding protein 2, acyl-CoA synthetases, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A. In vitro results suggested that osthole might be a dual PPARα/γ activator, but its chemical structure differed from that of the thiazolidinedione class of antidiabetic drugs. In addition, osthole markedly activated the AMP-activated protein kinase and its downstream acetyl CoA carboxylase molecules by increasing their phosphorylation levels. Finally, obese diabetic db/db mice were treated with osthole by different administered routes, and osthole was found to markedly reduce blood glucose level. Interestingly, osthole did not reduce the blood insulin or lipid levels, two phenomena that did occur in animals treated with insulin sensitizers like PPAR agonists. These results suggest that osthole can alleviate hyperglycemia and could be potentially developed into a novel drug for treatment of diabetes mellitus. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

70350357356	Comparative study of conventional colonoscopy, magnifying chromoendoscopy, and magnifying narrow-band imaging systems in the differential diagnosis of small colonic polyps between trainee and experienced endoscopist	Background: Removal of colorectal neoplastic polyps can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancers. It is important to distinguish neoplastic from nonneoplastic polyps. We compared the ability of a trainee and an experienced endoscopist in distinguishing between neoplastic polyps and nonneoplastic polyps by conventional white-light, magnifying narrow-band imaging (NBI), and magnifying chromoendoscopy. Materials and methods: One hundred and sixty-three small colorectal polyps from 104 patients were studied. All polyps were diagnosed by trainees and experienced endoscopists using conventional white-light, magnifying NBI, and magnifying chromoendoscopy. The kappa values of interobserver agreement between trainees and experienced endoscopists were evaluated before this study. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were assessed by reference to histopathology. The first 50 polyps were diagnosed by the trainee as the first stage and the rest 113 polyps were diagnosed as the second stage. Results: Magnifying NBI and magnifying chromoendoscopy were significant better than conventional white-light by the experienced endoscopist (diagnostic accuracy: NBI 85.3%, chromoendoscopy 87.7%, conventional view 74.8%). No significant differences were found for the trainee. The kappa values (0.77∼0.85) were good for each endoscopic modality for the experienced endoscopist. However, only NBI and chromoendoscopy had acceptable kappa values (0.40∼0.48) for the trainee. The trainee improved diagnostic accuracy in the second stage, but not yielded the level of the experienced endoscopist. Conclusion: Magnifying NBI and magnifying chromoendoscopy had a better interobserver agreement than conventional white-light among trainees and experienced endoscopists. The trainee needs learning time to improve diagnostic ability, even using a new modality such as magnifying NBI. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

70749139572	Clinical meaning of age-related expression of fecal cytokeratin 19 in colorectal malignancy	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of malignant death worldwide. Because young age of onset is often considered a poor prognostic factor for CRC, it is important to identify the poor outcomes of CRC in a younger population and to consider an aggressive approach by implementing early treatment. Our aim was to specifically quantify the fecal cytokeratin 19 (CK19) transcript from CRC patients and investigate its correlation with clinical stage, tumor malignancy, and age. Methods: The quantitation of fecal CK19 transcript was determined by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain in 129 CRC patients (45 younger than 60 years at diagnosis) and 85 healthy controls. The levels of CK19 protein were examined both in colonic cell lines and tissues. Results: The analysis of 45 younger CRC patients (age ≤ 60 years) revealed that patients at the M1 stage had significantly higher expression levels of fecal CK19 mRNA when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.001) and patients at the M0 stage (p = 0.004). Additionally, the degree of consistency between the mean level of fecal CK19 mRNA and the distant metastatic rate in each age interval was up to 89% (p = 0.042). Conclusion: These results indicate that high levels of fecal CK19 mRNA represent a potential marker for colorectal malignancy and for aggressive treatment of younger CRC patients. © 2009 Chang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0034753717	Splenic artery pseudoaneurysm within a pancreatic pseudocyst as a complication of chronic pancreatitis: Report of a case	Pancreatic pseudocyst is a common complication of chronic pancreatitis. Pseudoaneurysm can also be a complication of pancreatitis. A splenic pseudoaneurysm within a pancreatic pseudocyst is a less frequent complication of chronic pancreatitis. We present the case of a 35-year-old man with chronic pancreatitis who suffered from epigastric pain and a palpable epigastric mass. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated two concentric cystic lesions; the inner one had pulsatile arterial flow. In addition, magnetic resonance angiography confirmed a saccular lesion arising from the splenic artery. The surgical specimens contained a large pancreatic pseudocyst with an inner splenic pseudoaneurysm. A large thrombus measuring about 5 × 6 cm in the cavity of the splenic pseudoaneurysm was found. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful course and was well at follow-up for 2 years.

77950286406	Gastroprotective activity of atractylenolide III from Atractylodes ovata on ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in vitro and in vivo	Objectives The rhizome of Atractylodes ovata De Candolle is popularly used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases. However, the major gastroprotective compounds of A. ovata have not been identified. This study reports on the principal gastro- protective component of A. ovata. Methods Five sesquiterpenoids (atractylon, atractylenolides I, II, III and biatractylolide) were isolated from the extracts of A. ovata rhizome via silica gel column chromatography. The gastroprotective effects of these five sesquiterpenoids were measured in in-vitro ethanol-induced primary culture rat gastric mucosal (PRGM) cell damage and in-vivo ethanol-induced acute rat gastric ulcer models. Key findings Atractylon, atractylenolide I and biatractylolide were strongly toxic in PRGM cells, whilst atractylenolides II and III were not. Atractylenolide II did not show cytoprotective effects, but oral administration of atractylenolide III dose-dependently prevented ethanol-induced PRGM cell death and cell membrane damage. The EC50 values were 0.27 and 0.34 mm, respectively. In the in-vivo assay, atractylenolide III 10 mg/kg significantly reduced 70% ethanol-induced Wistar rat gastric ulcer. Atractylenolide III could inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression through upregulation of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase from the gastric ulcerated tissues. Conclusions Atractylenolide III was the major gastroprotective component of A. ovata in ethanol-induced acute gastric ulcer. It is suggested that the gastroprotective mechanism of atractylenolide III was via inhibition of the MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathway. © 2010 The Authors Journal compilation © 2010 Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.

78650145276	Upregulation of fecal cytokeratin 19 is associated with prognosis in older colorectal cancer patients	The upregulation of fecal cytokeratin 19 (CK19) correlates with age and metastatic status in human colorectal cancer (CRC). To further explore its clinical significance in older patients (>60 years), their fecal CK19 was measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Differences in CK19 transcripts were compared using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Clinical significance was assessed with the chi-squared test and a binary logistic regression model. The association between overall survival and expressions of fecal CK19 in combination with other serum markers, carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. In these older groups, CRC patients had significantly higher median fecal CK19 expression (p=0.006) than controls. The highest risk of CRC (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-14.7; p<0.001) was detected when the cutoff value for fecal CK19 expression was set at the median value of the 28 healthy controls. The lowest overall survival (29.2%±21.4%) occurred in patients in whom serum CA19-9 levels were high and fecal CK19 was overexpressed. Our results suggest that fecal CK19 expression is associated with CRC, and together with serum carcinoembryonic antigen or CA19-9, it can predict overall survival in older patients. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

78650742079	Abnormal gastroscopy findings were related to lower meridian energy	According to the theories of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), energy runs through 12 meridians longitudinally up and down the body. The study objectives were to compare the meridian energy between subjects with and without abnormal gastroscopy findings. We applied a cross-sectional and correlational research design. The study included 1,223 participants who had their health examinations at a university hospital in Taipei from 1st August 2005 through 31st August 2007. Meridian energy was examined using a meridian energy analysis device. The gastroscopy was operated by certified gastroenterologists. Participants with abnormal stomach and esophageal findings using gastroscopy had significantly lower mean meridian energy. There were no significant differences in meridian energy between participants with and without abnormal duodenum findings. When all of the meridians were examined individually, participants with abnormal findings in esophagus and stomach had significantly lower meridian energy in each of the meridians. The results of this study demonstrated that structural abnormality in the gastric area was related to lower meridian energy. Whether enhancing meridian energy could improve gastric and esophageal health merits further studies. Copyright © 2011 Sheng-Miauh Huang et al.

78751556777	Kiwifruit improves bowel function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional disorder of the gastrointestinal system, and is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea (IBS/D), constipation (IBS/C), and alternating diarrhea and constipation (IBSC/A). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a four week kiwifruit intervention on bowel function in patients diagnosed with IBS/C. Fifty-four patients with IBS/C and 16 healthy adults participated in this study. All subjects participated in the 6 week, three phase study, which included a baseline phase (1 week), a dietary intervention period (4 weeks), and a post-intervention phase (1 week). Forty-one IBS/C patients and all healthy adults consumed two Hayward green (Actinida deliciosa var) kiwifruits per day for 4 weeks. Thirteen IBS/C patients in the control group took two placebo capsules per day for 4 weeks. Colon transit time was measured immediately prior to and following the intervention period. All subjects completed daily defecation records. After the 4-week intervention, weekly defecation frequency significantly increased in the IBS/C group of participants who consumed kiwifruit (p<0.05). Colon transit time significantly decreased (p=0.026) in the IBS/C group that consumed kiwi fruit. These findings suggest that kiwifruit consumption for 4 weeks shortens colon transit time, increases defecation frequency, and improves bowel function in adults diagnosed with IBS/C.

0035693536	Endoscopic mucosal resection with a cap-fitted endoscope for early gastric carcinoma with focal submucosal invasion in apatient with decompensated liver cirrhosis	Abstract: Prognosis for patients with early gastric cancer who undergo gastric resection is far better than that for patients with advanced disease. However, patients with advanced liver cirrhosis may not be suitable for general anesthesia and major surgery. We used a less invasive endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) with a cap-fitted endoscope to resect an early gastric cancer in a 58-year-old male with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Although postoperative pathology revealed that the tumor had focal invasion to the submucosa, the patient had an uneventful course and was well during 4 years' follow-up. This method may be effective for the treatment of early gastric cancer with focal submucosal invasion when patients are not suitable for major surgery.

0035722368	Investigation of the extent of gastric metaplasia in the duodenal bulb by using methylene blue staining	Background and Aims: The existence of gastric metaplasia (GM) of the duodenal mucosa has been considered to be highly related to the recurrence of duodenal ulcers (DU). The aims of this study are to evaluate the usefulness of methylene blue staining in the detection of GM, and to clarify the relationship between GM and the deformity of the duodenal bulb. Methods: Fifteen patients with healed DU and four patients with symptoms of dyspepsia without evidence of ulcers were enrolled into this endoscopic study. During each endoscopy, methylene blue was sprayed evenly on the duodenal bulb, and biopsies were taken from blue-stained and unstained areas. The existence and extent of GM were assessed histologically and grossly. The correlation between duodenal bulb deformity and the extent of GM was also studied. Results: The mean score of methylene blue non-staining (MBNS) was 0, 1.30 ± 0.15, and 3.00 ± 0.00 in group A (non-ulcer patients), group B (patients with healed DU and with normal-shaped bulb) and C (patients with healed DU and with deformed duodenal bulb), respectively; showing significant differences among the groups (P < 0.05 in each). Both the existence and the grading of GM were higher in unstained specimens than in blue-stained specimens (100 vs 16.6%, P < 0.0001 and 3.62 ± 0.09 vs 0.19 ± 0.06, P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Methylene blue non-staining can be applied to investigate the existence and extent of GM in the duodenal bulb accurately. The incidence of GM in the duodenal bulb was higher in patients with healed ulcers than in non-ulcer patients. Patients with deformed duodenal bulbs have a higher extent of GM than those without deformed duodenal bulbs. © 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

79957484840	A predicted protein, KIAA0247, is a cell cycle modulator in colorectal cancer cells under 5-FU treatment	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the predominant gastrointestinal malignancy and the leading cause of cancer death. The identification of genes related to CRC is important for the development of successful therapies and earlier diagnosis.Methods: Molecular analysis of feces was evaluated as a potential method for CRC detection. Expression of a predicted protein with unknown function, KIAA0247, was found in feces evaluated using specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Its cellular function was then analyzed using immunofluorescent staining and the changes in the cell cycle in response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were assessed.Results: Gastrointestinal tissues and peripheral blood lymphocytes ubiquitously expressed KIAA0247. 56 CRC patients fell into two group categories according to fecal KIAA0247 mRNA expression levels. The group with higher fecal KIAA0247 (n = 22; ≥ 0.4897) had a significantly greater five-year overall survival rate than the group with lower fecal KIAA0247 (n = 30; < 0.4897) (66.0 ± 11.6%; p = 0.035, log-rank test). Fecal expression of KIAA0247 inversely related to CRC tumor size (Kendall's tau-b = -0.202; p = 0.047). Immunofluorescent staining revealed that the cytoplasm of CRC cells evenly expresses KIAA0247 without 5-FU treatment, and KIAA0247 accumulates in the nucleus after 40 μM 5-FU treatment.

79958841701	Serum Cellular Apoptosis Susceptibility Protein for Cancer Diagnosis	Tumor invasion and metastasis are the main cause of cancer mortality. CSE1L/CAS, the cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein, is the human homologue of the yeast chromosome segregation gene product, CSE1. Pathological studies show that CSE1L is highly expressed in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial carcinomas, skin cancer, colorectal cancer, lymphomas, prostate cancers, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, medulloblastomas, and glioblastomas. The CSE1L gene is located on chromosome 20q13, a region that frequently harbors amplifications that correlate with cancer aggression. Experimental studies have shown that CSE1L regulates the invasion of cancer cells in vitro and in animal metastasis models. The results of our recent studies have revealed that CSE1L is a secretory protein present in sera from cancer patients. Significantly, there is a higher prevalence of secretory CSE1L in sera of patients with metastatic cancer. Here, we discuss the potential of CSE1L as a serum marker for the diagnosis of cancer. © 2011.

79960878590	Discovery of serum biomarkers of alcoholic fatty liver in a rodent model: C-reactive protein	Background: Excessive consumption of alcohol contributes to alcoholic liver disease. Fatty liver is the early stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The aim of this study was to search for specific serological biomarkers of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL) compared to healthy controls, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and liver fibrosis in a rodent model. Methods. Serum samples derived from animals with AFL, NAFL, or liver fibrosis were characterized and compared using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis. A matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometer in conjunction with mascot software was used for protein identification. Subsequently, Western blotting and flexible multi-analyte profiling were used to measure the expressions of the putative biomarkers present in the serum of animals and clinical patients. Results: Eight differential putative biomarkers were identified, and the two most differentiated proteins, including upregulated C-reactive protein (CRP) and downregulated haptoglobin (Hp), were further investigated. Western blotting validated that CRP was dramatically higher in the serum of AFL compared to healthy controls and other animals with liver disease of NAFL or liver fibrosis (p < 0.05). Moreover, we found that CRP and Hp were both lower in liver fibrosis of TAA-induced rats and clinical hepatitis C virus-infected patients. Conclusion: The results suggest that increased levels of CRP are an early sign of AFL in rats. The abnormally elevated CRP induced by ethanol can be used as a biomarker to distinguish AFL from normal or otherwise diseased livers. © 2011 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80355149120	Hepatic failure related to itraconazole use successfully treated by corticosteroids	Background: Itraconazole is believed to carry a low risk of hepatic toxicity owing to its low affinity for the human P-450 enzyme. Therefore, hepatic failure caused by itraconazole is exceedingly rare. Objectives: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who developed hepatic failure related to itraconazole that was administered for the treatment of onychomycosis. Her condition deteriorated after withdrawal of the drug, followed solely by supportive care initially. Case Report: Treatment with corticosteroids was started 10 days after her admission, and her condition gradually improved. Unfortunately, her condition worsened when the dosage of corticosteroids was abruptly decreased. Ultimately, her condition improved with appropriate adjustments of corticosteroid dosage. Discussion: We conclude that corticosteroid therapy may be effective for itraconazole-induced hepatitis, especially in those patients who do not respond to conservative treatment. Notably, any decrease in the dosage should be performed with caution. We also recommend that close monitoring of liver function is mandatory during the use of itraconazole. © 2011 Kowsar M.P.Co.

84856727650	Glycated hemoglobin A1c is superior to fasting plasma glucose as an independent risk factor for colorectal neoplasia	Objective: To investigate which glycemic index is more strongly associated with colorectal neoplasia. Method: This cross-sectional study enrolled 2,776 participants in a comprehensive health management program which included measurement of fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c, along with screening colonoscopy. Primary outcome was colorectal adenoma with or without dysplasia. Risk factors for colorectal neoplasia were determined by the multivariate regression analysis, which evaluated the interrelationship among different glycemic indices in a hierarchical way. Results: Colorectal neoplasms were found in 605 (21.79%) examinees, 68 (2.45%) of whom had high-risk tumors. Glycemic indices including diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, fasting plasma glucose, and HbA1c were all associated with colorectal tumors in the univariate analysis. However, HbA1c outperformed the other two markers as an independent risk factor (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.36%) for colorectal neoplasia. Moreover, only HbA1c remained independently associated with colorectal tumor after patients with established diagnosis of diabetes (n = 132) were excluded. We also identified age, male gender, and smoking were independent risk factors for colorectal neoplasia. Conclusion: HbA1c as compared with fasting plasma glucose is more strongly and independently associated with colorectal neoplasia. Further research is warranted to elucidate the value of HbA1c in stratifying risk of colorectal cancer. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84862815916	New pathway to prepare gold nanoparticles and their applications in catalysis and surface-enhanced Raman scattering	As shown in the literature, additional energies are necessary for the reduction of positively charged noble metal ions to prepare metal nanoparticles (NPs). In this work, we report a new green pathway to prepare Au NPs in neutral 0.1. M NaCl aqueous solutions from bulk Au substrates without addition of any stabilizer and reductant just via aid of natural chitosan (Ch) at room temperature. Au- and Ch-containing complexes in aqueous solution were electrochemically prepared. The role of Ch is just an intermediate to perform electron transfer with Au NPs. The stability of these prepared Au NPs is well maintained by Au NPs themselves with slightly positively charged Au remained on the surface of Au NPs. The particle size of prepared spherical Au (1. 1. 1) NPs is ca. 15. nm in diameter. Moreover, increasing the pH of preparation solutions can be contributive to preparing concentrated Au NPs in solutions. The prepared Au NPs are surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active for probe molecules of Rhodamine 6G. They also demonstrate significantly catalytic activity for decomposition of acetaldehyde in rice wine. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862981315	Can we predict pathologic complete response before surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation therapy?	Background Pathologic complete response has been proven to have oncological benefits for locally advanced rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation therapy. The aims of this study are to analyze and determine the factors to predict pathologic complete response for patients treated with preoperative neoadjuvant therapy. Methods Patients with biopsy-proven, locally advanced rectal cancer were treated neoadjuvantly followed by radical surgical resection. Tumors were re-assessed after completing chemoradiation, including pelvic magnetic resonance images, colonoscopic examination, and re-biopsy. The results of examination were compared with the final pathologic status. Results A retrospective chart review of 166 patients was conducted. Twenty-five patients (15.1%) had pathologic complete response after chemoradiation. The 5-year overall survival rates were better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (91.1% vs. 70.8%; P=0.047), and there were also significant differences in the 5-year disease-free survival rates between these two groups (91.1% vs. 70.2%; P=0.027). The prediction rates for pathologic complete response by re-biopsy, magnetic resonance images, and colonoscopy were 21.4%, 33.3%, and 53.8%, respectively. In addition, when we further combine the results of colonoscopic findings and re-biopsy, the prediction rate for pathologic complete response reached 77.8% (P=0.009). Conclusions Combining the results of the re-biopsy and post-treatment colonoscopic findings, we can achieve a good prediction rate for pathologic complete response. Posttreatment magnetic resonance images are not useful tools in predicting tumor clearance following chemoradiation. © 2011 CARS.

84863063515	Human neutrophil peptides 1-3 as gastric cancer tissue markers measured by MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry: Implications for infiltrated neutrophils as a tumor target	Objective: Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs)-1,-2 and-3 are significantly upregulated and were reported as biomarkers in gastric cancer (GC). However, the tissue location and function of HNPs 1-3 are still unclear in GC, and the spatial distribution of the triad needs to be disclosed. The aims of this study were to investigate the distribution and relationships among HNPs-1,-2 and-3, and assess whether infiltrated neutrophils accumulate in gastric tumor. Methods: In this study, paired samples (n=33) of the GC tissues and adjacent normal tissues from the same patients were obtained from surgery. Expression of HNPs 1-3 were detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The distributions of the HNPs 1-3 in GC tissues were investigated. After verification of HNPs-1 by immunohistochemistry, infiltrated neutrophils were also detected. Then, an in vitro assay was used to observe the binding capacity and measure the cytotoxic effect of HNPs-1 against AGS cells. Results: Comparing to neighboring normal tissue, expressional level of HNPs 1-3 were significantly higher and their distributions overlapped in cancerous tissues of GC patients with high abundance in the lamina propria, whereas HNPs-1 was identified as the highest major peak. Moreover, HNPs-1,-2 and-3 correlated with each other. Besides, we also observed that increased infiltrated neutrophils accumulating in GC tissues, indicating that a strong positive correlation between HNPs 1-3 and infiltrated neutrophils. In addition, the further investigated demonstrated that the major peptide, HNPs-1, was statistically increased with the advance of tumor development from the early to advanced stage of GC (p< 0.05). Moreover, we also noticed that HNPs-1 with a great binding capacity to GC AGS cells in vitro can inhibit tumor cell growth. Conclusions: Our results suggest that neutrophil secreted peptides, HNPs 1-3, increased in the GC tissues and could be used as potential biomarkers detected using MALDI-TOF MS, implying that elevated neutrophils may be used as a tumor target for tumor treatment. The binding capacity of HNPs-1 with GC cells implies that tracking molecules conjugated with HNPs-1 could be applied as a specific probe for GC diagnoses. © 2012-IOS Press and the authors.

This study was aimed to determine whether treatment with PWS reduce gastric ulceration induced by indomethacin and influencing its anti-inflammatory effect. PWS was extracted with boiling water and the decoction was freeze-dried into powder (H-PWS). The amounts of glycyrrhizin and hesperidin in H-PWS were analyzed by a HPLC method to be 38 and 19 mg/g, respectively. Co-administration of H-PWS resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of indomethacin-induced gastric mucosal cell death.

84864842724	Clinical-pathological correlation of K-Ras mutation and ERK phosphorylation in colorectal cancer	The Ras-ERK pathway is frequently up-regulated in colorectal cancer.We analyzed the clinical-pathological correlation of K-Ras mutation and phospho-ERK expression in colorectal cancer. K-Ras mutations were detected in only 32.5% (41/126) of the colorectal cancer cases, while all cancers were positive for phospho-ERK staining. Colorectal cancer with wild-type K-Ras and low phospho-ERK expression had a significantly higher survival rate (log-rank P=0.04). There were 9 cases of K-Ras mutation/low phospho-ERK diseases; 88.9%(8/9) of them were stage III/IV diseases. High phospho-ERK expression was associated with a high stage and T status of the cancer, yet combined K-Ras mutation/phospho-ERK expression analysis further increased the efficiency of colorectal cancer prognosis. Our results demonstrate that Ras-ERK pathway correlated closely with colorectal cancer progression. Moreover, although colorectal cancer with K-Ras mutations has a more aggressive phenotype; the mutation rate is not very high. Phospho-ERK may be a useful marker in combination with K-Ras for improving the prognosis of colorectal cancer.

84865363739	Targeting to overexpressed glucose-regulated protein 78 in gastric cancer discovered by 2D DIGE improves the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of micelles-mediated system	The survivals of gastric cancer (GC) patients are associated with early diagnosis and effective treatments. Therefore, it is urgent for the discovery of early GC biomarkers and tumor-targeting therapeutics. The aim of this study was to uncover putative tissue biomarkers of GC using 2D DIGE and then apply one of these specific markers in GC treatment. We found three putative biomarkers of GC with significant differences in expression level compared to adjacent normal tissue, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and glutathione s-transferase pi (GSTpi) with increased expression level, and alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) with reduced expression level. The overexpressed GRP78 was used as a targeted protein for guiding the drugs to tumor cells, leading to more effective treatment for GC xenografts. Our results demonstrated that the designated GRP78-binding peptide based on the sequence, WIFPWIQL, was selectively prone to recognize and bind to GC MKN45 cells in vitro, and also improve the delivery efficiency of polymeric micelles-encapsulated drugs into tumor cells and displayed better therapeutic outcome in experimental animals. This strategy of GRP78-mediated drug targeting system may bring chemotherapeutic drugs with more precise targeting to tumor cells, leading to minimize side effects on patients after chemotherapy. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84866091631	The prognostic significance of nuclear CSE1L in urinary bladder urothelial carcinomas	Prognosis of urinary bladder urothelial carcinomas may be challenging; many tumors with similar histopathologic features show significantly different clinical outcomes. CSE1L, the chromosome segregation 1-like protein, is both a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein. We investigated the cytoplasmic/nuclear expression pattern of CSE1L to determine its potential prognostic significance. In immunohistochemical analysis, nonneoplastic urothelium showed faint CSE1L staining, whereas all tumors in the bladder cancer specimens had significant staining for CSE1L (100%, or 38/38). CSE1L cytoplasmic/nuclear staining was defined based on relative staining intensity. A total of 20 (52.6%) of 38 cancer specimens had strong nuclear CSE1L staining, and 44.7.3% (17/38) of the samples had strong cytoplasmic CSE1L staining. Bladder urothelial carcinomas with high CSE1L nuclear staining had a significantly lower overall survival rate (log-rank test, P =.011). CSE1L expression was not correlated with tumor stage, likely reflecting the faultiness of current urothelial carcinoma evaluation methods. Our results suggest that nuclear CSE1L may play an oncogenic role in bladder tumor progression and that immunohistochemical staining of nuclear CSE1L may be useful for the prognosis of bladder urothelial carcinomas. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

0037280420	It is difficult to eradicate helicobacter pylori from dental plaque by triple therapy	Background. Dental plaque has been suggested as a permanent reservoir of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and a potential source of reinfection. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of H. pylori in both dental plaque and the stomach and to evaluate the therapeutic effect of triple therapy on H. pylori in dental plaque. Methods. Dental plaque and gastric biopsy samples were obtained from 65 patients with dyspeptic symptoms for endoscopic examination. The prevalence of H. pylori in dental plaque and stomach was determined with rapid urease test, histologic examinations and polymerase chain reaction assay based on the primer pair derived from the cagA gene of H. pylori. Triple therapy was administered to patients infected with H. pylori. H. pylori status was re-evaluated after eradication therapy. Results. Prior to treatment, H. pylori was found in the stomach in 38 of 65 (58%) patients and in dental plaque in 28 of 65 (43%) patients. The coexisting infection rate of H. pylori in both stomach and dental plaque was 74%. After triple therapy, H. pylori was eradicated from the stomach in 32 of 38 (84%) patients, but only 2 of 28 (7%) patients with coexisting H. pylori infections of stomach and dental plaque showed the elimination of H. pylori from dental plaque. Conclusions. The high coexisting infection rate of H. pylori in both stomach and dental plaque implies that dental plaque can serve as another reservoir of H. pylori. H. pylori in dental plaque was hardly eradicated by triple therapy. Dental plaque may be a potential source for recrudescence of gastric infection after successful systemic therapy.

0037663714	Acute cholangitis secondary to a common bile duct adenoma	We report a case of distal common bile duct adenoma presenting with acute cholangitis. A 47-year-old woman suffered from right upper abdominal pain with persistent fever for 4 days. Abdominal ultrasonography showed mild dilatation of common bile duct and bilateral intrahepatic ducts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography disclosed a fixed filling defect in the distal common bile duct. Transpapillary biopsy and brush cytology was performed after sphincterotomy. The biopsy specimen showed adenomatous change with dysplasia and negative stain for p53. No significant regional lymph node enlargement was found on computed tomography. The patient subsequently received exploratory laparotomy and sphincteroplasty with excision of the distal common bile duct tumor. Finally, the tumor was diagnosed as common bile duct tubular adenoma with moderate nuclear dysplasia. Postoperatively, the patient had an uneventful course and has been well at follow-up for 8 months. We encountered a rare case of common bile duct adenoma in which malignant change was hard to rule out. We propose that sphincterotomy with biopsy is crucial before operation and p53 immunohistochemical staining is valuable for determining whether or not malignant change occurs in this borderline tumor.

In this work, we develop an electrochemical pathway to prepare more surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-active substrates with Ag UPD-modified Au nanoparticles (NPs) by using sonoelectrochemical deposition-dissolution cycles (SEDDCs). Encouragingly, the SERS of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) adsorbed on these Ag UPD-modified Au NPs exhibits a higher intensity by ca. 12-fold magnitude, as compared with that of R6G adsorbed on unmodified Au NPs. The prepared SERS-active substrate demonstrates a large Raman scattering enhancement for R6G with a detection limit of 2 × 10

84867527408	Presence of CSE1L protein in urine of patients with urinary bladder urothelial carcinomas	The chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L) protein is highly expressed in most cancers and has been shown to be secreted by tumor cells. We studied the presence of CSE1L in the urine of patients with bladder urothelial carcinomas. The results of our immunohistochemical analysis showed a high expression of CSE1L in bladder cancer specimens, while the normal bladder specimens only showed a very faint staining in some cells. Immunoblotting showed that CSE1L was present in urine of patients with bladder cancer. Urinary CSE1L-positive cases were detected in 95% (57/60) of patients with bladder urothelial carcinomas or the atypical/suspicious cases with urothelial atypia. No CSE1L was detected in urine of healthy controls (p<0.01). Our results suggest that urinary CSE1L deserves further evaluation for the screening of bladder cancer. © 2012 Wichtig Editore.

84870317657	CSE1L, a novel microvesicle membrane protein, mediates Ras-triggered microvesicle generation and metastasis of tumor cells	Tumor-derived microvesicles are rich in metastasis-related proteases and play a role in the interactions between tumor cells and tumor microenvironment in tumor metastasis. Because shed microvesicles may remain in the extracellular environment around tumor cells, the microvesicle membrane protein may be the potential target for cancer therapy. Here we report that chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L) protein is a microvesicle membrane protein and is a potential target for cancer therapy. v-H-Ras expression induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent CSE1L phosphorylation and microvesicle biogenesis in various cancer cells. CSE1L overexpression also triggered microvesicle generation, and CSE1L knockdown diminished v-H-Ras-induced microvesicle generation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 secretion and metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells. CSE1L was preferentially accumulated in microvesicles and was located in the microvesicle membrane. Furthermore, anti-CSE1L antibody-conjugated quantum dots could target tumors in animal models. Our findings highlight a novel role of Ras-ERK signaling in tumor progression and suggest that CSE1L may be involved in the "early" and "late" metastasis of tumor cells in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the novel microvesicle membrane protein, CSE1L, may have clinical utility in cancer diagnosis and targeted cancer therapy.

84872843410	Observation of the absorption of the In-DTPA-hexa-lactoside (IDHL) and its distribution in vitro by ICP-MS and TOF-SIMS	The distribution of carbohydrate drug containing indiums 'In-DTPA-hexa-lactoside (IDHL)' in human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) had been observed, and cell viability was investigated at the same time. The cell survival and mitochondrial metabolism of HepG2 after treated with 50 μΜ IDHL for 24 h were investigated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetra-zolium bromide assay, and the cytotoxicity was evaluated by lactate dehydrogenase method (LDH assay). The intracellular indium ion concentration was quantitated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Besides, the distribution of indium ion in HepG2 was also analyzed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry for comparison. The results demonstrated that there were only small amount of indium ions distributed inside the cytoplasm and the cell membrane. This means that HepG2 had very limited IDHL absorption, and there was almost no attachment of IDHL onto the HepG2 cell membrane. In these experiments, a parsing technique was established, which can shed some light on the understanding toward the absorption and distribution of these isotope compounds in vitro.

84873051362	Correlations between cytoplasmic CSE1L in neoplastic colorectal glands and depth of tumor penetration and cancer stage	Background: Colorectal carcinomas spread easily to nearby tissues around the colon or rectum, and display strong potential for invasion and metastasis. CSE1L, the chromosome segregation 1-like protein, is implicated in cancer progression and is located in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of tumor cells. We investigated the prognostic significance of cytoplasmic vs. nuclear CSE1L expression in colorectal cancer.Methods: The invasion- and metastasis-stimulating activities of CSE1L were studied by in vitro invasion and animal experiments. CSE1L expression in colorectal cancer was assayed by immunohistochemistry, with tissue microarray consisting of 128 surgically resected specimens; and scored using a semiquantitative method. The correlations between CSE1L expression and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed.Results: CSE1L overexpression was associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis of cancer cells. Non-neoplastic colorectal glands showed minimal CSE1L staining, whereas most colorectal carcinomas (99.2%, 127/128) were significantly positive for CSE1L staining. Cytoplasmic CSE1L was associated with cancer stage (P=0.003) and depth of tumor penetration (P=0.007). Cytoplasmic CSE1L expression also correlated with lymph node metastasis of the disease in Cox regression analysis. Conclusions: CSE1L regulates the invasiveness and metastasis of cancer cells, and immunohistochemical analysis of cytoplasmic CSE1L in colorectal tumors may provide a useful aid to prognosis. © 2013 Tai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84874488615	Clinicopathological Correlation and Prognostic Significance of Protein Kinase Cα Overexpression in Human Gastric Carcinoma	Objectives: This study investigated the PKCα protein expression in gastric carcinoma, and correlated it with clinicopathological parameters. The prognostic significance of PKCα protein expression in gastric carcinoma was analyzed. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR test was applied to compare the PKCα mRNA expression in tumorous and nontumorous tissues of gastric carcinoma in ten randomly selected cases. Then PKCα protein expression was evaluated in 215 cases of gastric carcinoma using immunohistochemical method. The immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively as: 0 = absent; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; and 3 = strong. All cases were further classified into two groups, namely PKCα overexpression group with score 2 or 3, and non-overexpression group with score 0 or 1. The PKCα protein expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Survival analysis was performed to determine the prognostic significance of PKCα protein expression in patients with gastric carcinoma. Results: PKCα mRNA expression was upregulated in all ten cases of gastric carcinoma via quantitative real-time PCR test. In immunohistochemical study, eighty-eight out of 215 cases (41%) of gastric carcinoma revealed PKCα protein overexpression, which was statistically correlated with age (P = 0.0073), histologic type (P<0.0001), tumor differentiation (P = 0.0110), depth of invasion (P = 0.0003), angiolymphatic invasion (P = 0.0373), pathologic stage (P = 0.0047), and distant metastasis (P = 0.0048). We found no significant difference in overall and disease free survival rates between PKCα overexpression and non-overexpression groups (P = 0.0680 and 0.0587). However, PKCα protein overexpression emerged as a significant independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 0.632, P = 0.0415). Conclusions: PKCα protein is upregulated in gastric carcinoma. PKCα protein expression is statistically correlated with age, histologic type, tumor differentiation, depth of invasion, angiolymphatic invasion, pathologic stage, and distant metastasis. The PKCα protein overexpression in patients with gastric carcinoma is a significant independent prognostic factor in multivariate Cox regression analysis. © 2013 Lin et al.

84875227493	High nuclear expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in tumor cells in colorectal glands is associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer	Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a major downstream transducer of Ras and plays an important role in transducing extracellular signals to the nuclei of cells. It is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells. The nuclear localization of phosphorylated or activated ERK is involved in the invasive behavior of tumor cells. We studied the association between Ras mutation/ERK activation and the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer. We analyzed 126 surgically resected colorectal cancer specimens for K-Ras mutation using direct sequencing. Activation/phosphorylation of ERK was assayed by immunohistochemistry with tissue microarray, and the staining intensity was analyzed using a semiquantitative scoring system. K-Ras mutations were detected in 32.5% (41/126) of the colorectal tumors. Colorectal glands are important functional organs in colorectal tissue and form the origin of colorectal carcinomas. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry tests showed that tumors in colorectal cancer specimens were significantly stained for phospho-ERK (100%; 126/126), whereas nonneoplastic colorectal glands mainly showed faint phosphorylated ERK staining. High nuclear phospho-ERK expression in tumors was associated with highly invasive cancer stage and T status of the disease. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that nuclear but not cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK expression correlated with the patients' overall survival rate (P =.039). Colorectal adenomas including tubular adenomas and tubulovillous adenomas mainly showed weak cytoplasmic phospho-ERK expression. Our results suggest that immunohistologic analysis of phosphorylated ERK expression in colorectal glands may aid the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and that nuclear phosphorylated ERK might be a valuable prognostic marker for colorectal cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, peptides or molecules with specific recognition to GRP78 can act as a guiding probe to direct conjugated imaging agents to localized cancers. Based on this rationale, GRP78-guided polymeric micelles were designed and manufactured for nuclear imaging detection of tumors. Thiolated GRP78 binding peptide (GRP78BP) was first labeled with maleimide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) and then mixed with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-linked poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) to form DTPA/GRP78BP-conjugated micelles.

84880174594	Aqueous extract of solanum nigrum leaves induces autophagy and enhances cytotoxicity of cisplatin, doxorubicin, docetaxel, and 5-fluorouracil in human colorectal carcinoma cells	Colorectal cancer is a common cancer worldwide, and chemotherapy is a mainstream approach for advanced and recurrent cases. Development of effective complementary drugs could help improve tumor suppression efficiency and control adverse effects from chemotherapy. The aqueous extract of Solanum nigrum leaves (AE-SN) is an essential component in many traditional Chinese medicine formulas for treating cancer, but there is a lack of evidence verifying its tumor suppression efficacy in colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tumor suppression efficacy of AE-SN using DLD-1 and HT-29 human colorectal carcinoma cells and examine the combined drug effect when combined with the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin, doxorubicin, docetaxel, and 5-fluorouracil. The results indicated that AE-SN induced autophagy via microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 A/B II accumulation but not caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in both cell lines. The IC after 48 hours of treatment were 0.541 and 0.948 mg/ml AE-SN in DLD-1 and HT-29, respectively. AE-SN also demonstrated a combined drug effect with all tested drugs by enhancing cytotoxicity in tumor cells. Our results suggest that AE-SN has potential in the development of complementary chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. © 2013 Chen-Jei Tai et al.

84880577219	Facile synthesis of smart magnetic graphene for safe drinking water: Heavy metal removal and disinfection control	Bacterial infections, the toxicity of engineered nanomaterials, the presence of inorganic pollutants in the environment, and providing safe drinking water are the most threatening problems of the 21st century. To tackle these challenges, we develop a one-pot, solvent free, and rapid synthesis of smart magnetic graphene (SMG) by microwave irradiation of graphene oxide (GO) and ferrocene precursors. The SMG possesses increased adsorption sites with tunable superparamagnetic properties (50 emu/g, 1:7 wt %), facilitating the adsorption and magnetic separation of aqueous Cr(VI), As(V), and Pb(II) with ∼99% removal efficiencies down to the 1 ppb level. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of SMG-Cr(VI) reveals the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), presumably due to the surface phenolic groups and unprotected ferrous ions on the SMG surface. The maximum adsorption capacity of SMG is 4.86, 3.26, and 6.00 mg/g for respectively Cr(VI), As(V), and Pb(II) at an initial concentration of 5.0 ppm. The addition of KNO

84882599690	Association between interleukin 1β and interleukin 10 concentrations: A cross-sectional study in young adolescents in Taiwan	Background: In adults, low circulating interleukin 10 (IL10) has been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, studies investigating IL10 in overweight and obese children have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with serum IL10 concentration in young Chinese adolescents.Methods: Young adolescents (n=325) ages 13.33±1.10 years were recruited into the cross-sectional study from 2010 to 2011. Parameters of obesity, individual components of MetS, iron status and serum IL10 were evaluated.Results: Compared with their normal weight counterparts, overweight adolescents had lower serum IL10 but higher TNFα, nitric oxide (NO) and IL1β concentrations (all p<0.05). Obese adolescents had increased IL1β but decreased hepcidin concentration compared with normal weight (p<0.01 and p<0.05; respectively). A strong inverse relationship (p<0.0001) was found between IL10 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL1β). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed serum IL1β was significantly correlated with IL10 (β=-0.156, p<0.0001). When overweight and obese adolescents were assessed separately from normal weight, only IL1β was inversely associated with serum IL10 (β=-0.231, p=0.0009). The association between IL10 and IL1β was weaker in adolescents with normal weight (β=-0.157, p=0.0002), after adjusting for gender, TNFα, IFNγ and NO.Conclusions: Our study confirmed that low IL10 concentration is associated with overweight and obesity in young adolescents. We also demonstrated for the first time that pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1β is independently associated with IL10. A decline in IL10 concentration in overweight and obese adolescents may further contribute to the IL1β-mediated inflammatory environment associated with obesity. © 2013 Chang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84882823462	CSE1L modulates ras-induced cancer cell invasion: Correlation of K-ras mutation and CSE1L expression in colorectal cancer progression	Background: Ras plays an important role in colorectal cancer progression. CSE1L (chromosome segregation 1-like) gene maps to 20q13, a chromosomal region that correlates with colorectal cancer development. We investigated the association of CSE1L with Ras in colorectal cancer progression. Methods: The effect of CSE1L on metastasis-stimulating activity of Ras was studied in an animal model with tumor cells expressing CSE1L-specific shRNA and v-H-Ras. CSE1L expression was evaluated by the immunohistochemical analysis of 127 surgically resected colorectal tumors. K-Ras mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing. Results: CSE1L knockdown reduced Ras-induced metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. v-H-Ras expression altered the cellular trafficking of CSE1L and increased CSE1L secretion. Most colorectal tumors were positive for CSE1L staining (98.4%, 125 of 127). Colorectal tumors with K-Ras mutation or high cytoplasmic CSE1L expression were correlated with T status (depth of tumor penetration; P =.004), stage (P =.004), and lymph node metastasis (P =.019). Conclusions: CSE1L may be a target for treating Ras-associated tumors. Analysis of K-Ras mutation and CSE1L expression may provide valuable clinical and pathological information to aid in the determination of treatment options for colorectal cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84884234937	The frequencies of gastroesophageal and extragastroesophageal symptoms in patients with mild erosive esophagitis, severe erosive esophagitis, and barrett's esophagus in Taiwan	Background. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms. Currently, the frequencies of gastroesophageal and extragastroesophageal symptoms in Asian patients with different categories of GERD remain unclear. Aim. To investigate the frequencies of gastroesophageal and extragastroesophageal symptoms in patients with mild erosive esophagitis, severe erosive esophagitis, and Barrett's esophagus of GERD. Methods. The symptoms of symptomatic subjects with (1) Los Angeles grade A/B erosive esophagitis, (2) Los Angeles grade C/D erosive esophagitis, and (3) Barrett's esophagus proven by endoscopy were prospectively assessed by a standard questionnaire for gastroesophageal and extragastroesophageal symptoms. The frequencies of the symptoms were compared by Chi-square test. Result. Six hundred and twenty-five patients (LA grade A/B: 534 patients; LA grade C/D: 37 patients; Barrett's esophagus: 54 patients) were assessed for gastroesophageal and extragastroesophageal symptoms. Patients with Los Angeles grade A/B erosive esophagitis had higher frequencies of symptoms including epigastric pain, epigastric fullness, dysphagia, and throat cleaning than patients with Los Angeles grade C/D erosive esophagitis. Patients with Los Angeles grade A/B erosive esophagitis also had higher frequencies of symptoms including acid regurgitation, epigastric acidity, regurgitation of food, nausea, vomiting, epigastric fullness, dysphagia, foreign body sensation of throat, throat cleaning, and cough than patients with Barrett's esophagus. Conclusion. The frequencies of some esophageal and extraesophageal symptoms in patients with Los Angeles grade A/B erosive esophagitis were higher than those in patients with Los Angeles grade C/D erosive esophagitis and Barrett's esophagus. The causes of different symptom profiles in different categories of GERD patients merit further investigations. © 2013 Sung-Shuo Kao et al.

84886775070	A gene expression signature of epithelial tubulogenesis and a role for ASPM in pancreatic tumor progression	Background & Aims Many patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) develop recurrent or metastatic diseases after surgery, so it is important to identify those most likely to benefit from aggressive therapy. Disruption of tissue microarchitecture is an early step in pancreatic tumorigenesis and a parameter used in pathology grading of glandular tumors. We investigated whether changes in gene expression during pancreatic epithelial morphogenesis were associated with outcomes of patients with PDAC after surgery. Methods We generated architectures of human pancreatic duct epithelial cells in a 3-dimensional basement membrane matrix. We identified gene expression profiles of the cells during different stages of tubular morphogenesis (tubulogenesis) and of PANC-1 cells during spheroid formation. Differential expression of genes was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. We compared the gene expression profile associated with pancreatic epithelial tubulogenesis with that of PDAC samples from 27 patients, as well as with their outcomes after surgery. Results We identified a gene expression profile associated with tubulogenesis that resembled the profile of human pancreatic tissue with differentiated morphology and exocrine function. Patients with PDACs with this profile fared well after surgery. Based on this profile, we established a 6-28 gene tubulogenesis-specific signature that accurately determined the prognosis of independent cohorts of patients with PDAC (total n = 128; accuracy = 81.2%-95.0%). One gene, ASPM, was down-regulated during tubulogenesis but up-regulated in human PDAC cell lines and tumor samples; up-regulation correlated with patient outcomes (Cox regression P =.0028). Bioinformatic, genetic, biochemical, functional, and clinical correlative studies showed that ASPM promotes aggressiveness of PDAC by maintaining Wnt-β-catenin signaling and stem cell features of PDAC cells. Conclusions We identified a gene expression profile associated with pancreatic epithelial tubulogenesis and a tissue architecture-specific signature of PDAC cells that is associated with patient outcomes after surgery. © 2013 by the AGA Institute.

84885978121	High nuclear phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase expression associated with poor differentiation, larger tumor size, and advanced stage of breast cancer	Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) is implicated in the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells. However, previous clinical-pathological studies have shown that expression of activated/phosphorylated ERK1/2 is not associated with enhanced proliferation and invasion of mammary carcinomas. ERK1/2 is expressed in the cytoplasm, and activated/phosphorylated ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus. The aim of this study is to evaluate nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 as a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis. The clinical-pathological relation of cytoplasmic/nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 was analyzed in 105 surgically resected breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry with tissue microarray. The results showed that non-neoplastic breast tissue mainly showed faint phosphorylated ERK1/2 staining. No statistically significant association was found between the level of cytoplasmic phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression and the clinical features of the disease. High nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression was associated with high grade (poor differentiation, p = = 0.010), high T status (larger tumor size, p = 0.033), and an advanced stage (p = 0.018) of the disease. Thus, nuclear phosphorylated ERK1/2 is associated with enhanced pro-liferation and invasion of mammary carcinomas and may be a biomarker for breast cancer prognosis and the determination of therapeutic strategies.

84889671007	Highly effective surface-enhanced Raman scattering-active gold substrates prepared by using electrochemical methods in the presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide	As shown in the literature, Au nanoparticles (NPs) were popularly used in the fields of catalyst and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Meanwhile, cationic surfactants of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were generally employed in syntheses of Au nanorods (NRs). In this work, CTAB is used to prepare highly effectively SERS-active Au substrates via electrochemical oxidation-reduction cycles (ORCs) for the first time. Based on the effectively SERS-active Au substrate prepared under assistance of CTAB, the SERS of Rhodamine 6G (R6G) exhibits a higher intensity by more than one order of magnitude, as compared with that of R6G adsorbed on a SERS-active Au substrate without the assistance of CTAB in preparation. Experimental results indicate that the quantities of adsorption sites for the developed SERS-active Au substrates are large enough to accommodate considerable ranges of analyte concentrations. The aging of SERS enhancement capability can be markedly depressed on this substrate. Moreover, its potential application in the trace detection of monosodium urate (MSU)-containing solution in gouty arthritis can be promised using this SERS-active Au substrate with CTAB. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84890805150	Silencing glucose-regulated protein 78 induced renal cell carcinoma cell line G1 cell-cycle arrest and resistance to conventional chemotherapy	Objective: Glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone; it maintains endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and modulates unfolded protein response. The protein is overexpressed in various cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Increased Grp78 expression in patients with RCC is correlated with more aggressive tumors and poorer prognoses. This study investigated the role of Grp78 in regulating tumorigenesis and evaluated the potential of Grp78-targeted therapy for RCC. Methods: The expression level of Grp78 was examined in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-intact or VHL-null RCC cell lines by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Specific Grp78 ribonucleic acid interference was applied as a molecularly Grp78-targeted therapeutic approach. This method enabled us to assess the effects of manipulating Grp78 expression to regulate RCC cell growth. Results: The Grp78 messenger ribonucleic acid and protein were expressed in both VHL-intact and VHL-null RCC cell lines. The specific inhibition of Grp78 expression suppressed RCC cell growth and colony formation significantly, and induced G1 cell-cycle arrest. We also showed that inhibiting Grp78 expression increased the cells' resistance to the cytotoxicity of the S-phase-specific anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. This effect was regulated by the unfolded protein response-induced suppression of G1/S transition-related cyclins (D1, E1, and E2) and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK4 and CDK6) protein expression. Conclusion: Overall, our findings indicate the regulatory function of Grp78 in RCC cell proliferation, and provide a molecular-based mechanism of Grp78 positivity in the progression of RCC. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84895929713	Interleukin 10 and clustering of metabolic syndrome components in pediatrics	Background: Interleukin 10 (IL-10) has multifaceted anti-inflammatory properties that are known to regulate insulin sensitivity and atherosclerotic development. However, studies in children are limited and have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether changes in this circulating anti-inflammatory cytokine is a marker for metabolic syndrome. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study involved children and young adolescents from eight elementary schools and two junior high schools located in Taipei and New Taipei City. A total of 553 children ages 8, 11 and 13 years old were included in the analysis. Parameters for obesity, anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and metabolic risk profiles were evaluated. Results: Overweight/obese children had lower serum IL-10 concentrations compared with normal weight children in the same age group (all P < 0·001). IL-10 quartiles were negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) and percentage (%) body fat (all P < 0·05). Multivariate regression analysis showed significant inverse relationship between IL-10 concentrations and % body fat (β = -0·009, P < 0·0001), and total cholesterol (β = -0·726, P = 0·003), and a small positive correlation between IL-10 and systolic blood pressure (β = 0·980, P = 0·027). In normal weight children, IL-10 concentrations were independently associated with fasting plasma insulin (β = 0·2912, P = 0·001) and waist circumference (β = 0·0069, P = 0·022). By contrast, % body fat (β = -0·016, P = 0·0009) was independently associated with IL-10 concentrations in overweight and obese children. Association between IL-10 and fasting plasma insulin concentrations was weaker in overweight/obese children compared with normal weight (β = 0·283, P = 0·011 vs. β = 0·2912, P = 0·001). Conclusion: Our data indicate that changes in circulating IL-10 concentrations are marker of metabolic risk in children. © 2014 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

Besides, we used a seventh-order moving average method for the construction of a learning curve in robotic surgery. Results: Operating time was 374.3 min (range, 210-570 min) in the laparoscopic group and 485.8 min (range, 315-720 min) in the robotic group, with statistical difference between these two groups (P<0.001). Thirteen patients (46.4 %) received diverting stoma in the laparoscopic group and seven patients (19.4 %) in the robotic group, with statistical difference between these two groups (P=0.021). Operative experience of robotic ISR showed that the mean operating time was 519.5 min (range, 360-720 min) in the first stage and 448.2 min (range, 315-585 min) in the second stage, with statistical difference between these two stages (P=0.02). Multifactorial analysis showed that protective diverting stoma creation or neorectum necrosis was not associated with age, sex, pretreatment T stage, or surgeons' experience. Conclusions: Our data shows that robot-assisted ISR for low rectal cancer is feasible and safe with no compromising oncological outcomes. The surgeons' experience improves operating time in robotic surgery. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.

84904327334	Single-incision versus conventional laparoscopic appendectomy in 688 patients: A retrospective comparative analysis	Background: Laparoscopic surgery has become the standard for treating appendi - citis. The cosmetic benefits of using single-incision laparoscopy are well known, but its duration, complications and time to recovery have not been well documented. We compared 2 laparoscopic approaches for treating appendicitis and evaluated postoperative pain, complications and time to full recovery. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of consecutive patients with appendicitis and compared those who underwent conventional laparoscopic appendectomy (CLA) performed using 3 incisions and those who underwent single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA). During SILA, the single port was prepared to increase visibility of the operative site. Results: Our analysis included 688 consecutive patients: 618 who underwent CLA and 70 who underwent SILA. Postsurgical complications occurred more frequently in the CLA than the SILA group (18.1% v. 7.1%, p = 0.018). Patients who underwent SILA returned to oral feeding sooner than those who underwent CLA (median 12 h v. 22 h, p < 0.001). These between-group differences remained significant after controlling for other factors. Direct comparison of only nonperforated cases, which was determined by pathological examination, revealed that SILA was significantly longer than CLA (60 min v. 50 min, p < 0.001). Patients who underwent SILA had longer in-hospital stays than those who underwent CLA (72 v. 55 h, p < 0.001); however, they had significantly fewer complications (3.0% v. 14.4%, p = 0.006). Conclusion: In addition to its cosmetic advantages, SILA led to rapid recovery and no increase in postsurgical pain or complications. © 2014 Canadian Medical Association.

84906877460	Analysis of core-shell-isolated nanoparticle configurations used in the surface-enhanced raman scattering technique	Core-shell-isolated nanoparticles are commonly used in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique to detect binding events and in analyte identification at the molecule level. In this paper, an opticalscattering theoretical model was used in which the core-shell-isolated nanoparticles are considerably smaller than incident light wavelengths, and the finite difference time domain method of numerical electromagnetics was adopted to compute the scattered opticalpower density per unit volume of the nanoparticles. In addition, the power densities were analyzed using various shell materials and the influences of differing parameters (i.e., the size of metal nanoparticles, shell thickness, nanoparticle size, and the distance between nanoparticles) on power-density functions were explored. The results indicated that when the nanoparticle shells were coated with silicon dioxide (SiO

84908090836	Inverse correlation of phospho-KDR/Flk-1 expression and stage of colorectal cancer: Implication of the significance of neoangiogenesis in activated VEGFR -2 expressing early stage colorectal adenocarcinomas	The activation of vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) plays an essential role in cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the expression of phosphorylated VEGFR-2 (or phospho-KDR/Flk-1), the activated form of VEGFR-2, in human colorectal adenomas and colorectal adenocarcinomas. Phospho- KDR/Flk-1 showed weak expression in the normal colorectal tissue. Phospho- KDR/Flk-1 was mainly stained in the cytoplasm of colorectal adenomas, and was stained in both the cytoplasm and nuclei colorectal adenocarcinomas. There was no indication of increased phospho-KDR/Flk-1 expression in the colorectal adenocarcinomas, as compared to that of colorectal adenomas. Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship of phospho-KDR/Flk-1 expression with cancer stage (p < 0.0001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.011), and distant metastasis (p = = 0.021) of the colorectal adenocarcinomas. Our results indicate that early stage colorectal adenocarcinomas with highly activated (phosphorylated) VEGFR-2 expression may indicate the significance of neoangiogenesis of the tumors.
