We use 162pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. We select events with one W boson and at least one jet with an identified secondary vertex. In the jets with a secondary vertex we look for a semileptonic decay to a muon. We compare the number of jets with both a secondary vertex and a semileptonic decay and the kinematic properties of these jets, with the standard model expectation of W plus heavy flavor production and decay. No discrepancy is seen between the observation and the expectation, and we set limits on the production cross section of a B-like hadron with an anomalously high semileptonic branching ratio. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

We calculate a likelihood function for the top-quark mass in events that are consistent with tt ̄ → b̄ - ν̄ b ′+ν ′ decays. The likelihood is formed as the convolution of the leading-order matrix element and detector resolution functions. The joint likelihood is the product of likelihoods for each of 33 events collected in 340pb-1 of integrated luminosity, yielding a top-quark mass Mt=165.2±6.1(stat)±3.4(syst) GeV/c2.

This is the first measurement which makes no explicit lepton identification requirements, so that sensitivity to W→τν decays is maintained. Heavy flavor jets from top quark decay are identified with a secondary vertex tagging algorithm.

33745080312	Measurement of the top quark mass using template methods on dilepton events in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We describe a measurement of the top quark mass from events produced in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV, using the Collider Detector at Fermilab. We identify tt̄ candidates where both W bosons from the top quarks decay into leptons (eν, μν, or τν) from a data sample of 360pb-1. The top quark mass is reconstructed in each event separately by three different methods, which draw upon simulated distributions of the neutrino pseudorapidity, tt̄ longitudinal momentum, or neutrino azimuthal angle in order to extract probability distributions for the top quark mass. For each method, representative mass distributions, or templates, are constructed from simulated samples of signal and background events, and parametrized to form continuous probability density functions. A likelihood fit incorporating these parametrized templates is then performed on the data sample masses in order to derive a final top quark mass. Combining the three template methods, taking into account correlations in their statistical and systematic uncertainties, results in a top quark mass measurement of 170.1±6.0(stat.)±4.1(syst.) GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646409558	Search for scalar bottom quarks from gluino decays in p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV	We searched for scalar bottom quarks in 156pb-1 of p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment at the Tevatron. Scalar bottom quarks can be produced from gluino decays in R-parity conserving models of supersymmetry when the mass of the gluino exceeds that of the scalar bottom quark. Then, a scalar bottom quark can decay into a bottom quark and a neutralino. To search for this scenario, we investigated events with large missing transverse energy and at least three jets, two or more of which were identified as containing a secondary vertex from the hadronization of b quarks. We found four candidate events, where 2.6±0.7 are expected from standard model processes, and placed 95% confidence level lower limits on gluino and scalar bottom quark masses of up to 280 and 240GeV/c2, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646492293	Measurement of the top quark mass with the dynamical likelihood method using lepton plus jets events with b-tags in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes a measurement of the top quark mass, Mtop, with the dynamical likelihood method (DLM) using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The Tevatron produces top/antitop (tt̄) pairs in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. The data sample used in this analysis was accumulated from March 2002 through August 2004, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 318pb-1. We use the tt̄ candidates in the "lepton+jets" decay channel, requiring at least one jet identified as a b quark by finding a displaced secondary vertex. The DLM defines a likelihood for each event based on the differential cross section as a function of Mtop per unit phase space volume of the final partons, multiplied by the transfer functions from jet to parton energies. The method takes into account all possible jet combinations in an event, and the likelihood is multiplied event by event to derive the top quark mass by the maximum likelihood method. Using 63 tt̄ candidates observed in the data, with 9.2 events expected from background, we measure the top quark mass to be 173.2+2.6-2.4(stat.)±3. 2(syst.)GeV/c2, or 173.2+4.1-4.0GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Z bosons are identified in their electron and muon decay modes, and b jets with ET>20GeV and |η|<1.5 are identified by reconstructing a secondary decay vertex. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 330pb-1. A cross section times branching ratio of σ(Z+bjets)×B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=0.93±0.36pb is found, where B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-) is the branching ratio of the Z boson or γ* into a single flavor dilepton pair (e or μ) in the mass range between 66 and 116GeV/c2. The ratio of b jets to the total number of jets of any flavor in the Z sample, within the same kinematic range as the b jets, is 2.36±0.92%. Here, the uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties.

A b-tagging algorithm based on the probability of displaced tracks coming from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify b quarks from top decay. Using 318pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector, we measure the tt̄ production cross section in events with at least one restrictive (tight) b-tagged jet and obtain 8.9-1.0+1.0(stat)-1.0+1.1(syst)pb. The cross section value assumes a top quark mass of mt=178GeV/c2 in the acceptance corrections. The dependence of the cross section on mt is presented in the paper. This result is consistent with other CDF measurements of the tt̄ cross section using different samples and analysis techniques, and has similar systematic uncertainties. We have also performed consistency checks by using the b-tagging probability function to vary the signal-to-background ratio and also using events that have at least two b-tagged jets. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data cover the jet transverse momentum range from 61 to 620GeV/c, extending the reach by almost 150GeV/c compared with previous measurements at the Tevatron. The results are in good agreement with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions using the CTEQ6.1M parton distribution functions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

We compare the number of events observed in the data with a data-based estimate of the standard model backgrounds contributing to this signature. We observe no significant excess of events, and we interpret this null result in terms of lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale for a large extra dimensions scenario. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33847249405	Precision measurement of the top-quark mass from dilepton events at CDF II	We report a measurement of the top-quark mass, Mt, in the dilepton decay channel of tt̄→b ′+ν ′b̄ -ν̄ using an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb-1 of pp̄ collisions collected with the CDF II detector. We apply a method that convolutes a leading-order matrix element with detector resolution functions to form event-by-event likelihoods; we have enhanced the leading-order description to describe the effects of initial-state radiation. The joint likelihood is the product of the likelihoods from 78 candidate events in this sample, which yields a measurement of Mt=164.5±3.9(stat.)±3.9(syst.)GeV/c2, the most precise measurement of Mt in the dilepton channel. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We require the absence of any particle signatures in the detector except for an electron and a positron candidate, each with transverse energy ET>5GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<2. With these criteria, 16 events are observed compared to a background expectation of 1.9±0.3 events. These events are consistent in cross section and properties with the QED process pp̄→p+e+e-+p̄ through two-photon exchange. The measured cross section is 1.6-0.3+0.5(stat)±0.3(syst)pb.

33947269107	Measurement of the helicity fractions of W bosons from top quark decays using fully reconstructed tt̄ events with CDF II	We present a measurement of the fractions F0 and F+ of longitudinally polarized and right-handed W bosons in top-quark decays using data collected with the CDF II detector. The data set used in the analysis corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. We select tt̄ candidate events with one lepton, at least four jets, and missing transverse energy. Our helicity measurement uses the decay angle θ*, which is defined as the angle between the momentum of the charged lepton in the W boson rest frame and the W momentum in the top-quark rest frame. The cos θ* distribution in the data is determined by full kinematic reconstruction of the tt̄ candidates. We find F0=0.85-0.22+0.15(stat)±0.06(syst) and F+=0.05-0.05+0.11(stat)±0.03(syst), which is consistent with the standard model prediction.

33846940443	Search for exotic S=-2 baryons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	A search for a manifestly exotic S=-2 baryon state decaying to Ξ-π-, and its neutral partner decaying to Ξ-π+, has been performed using 220pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected by the Collider Detector at Fermilab. The Ξ- trajectories were measured in a silicon tracker before their decay, resulting in a sample with low background and excellent position resolution. No evidence was found for S=-2 pentaquark candidates in the invariant mass range of 1600-2100MeV/c2. Upper limits on the product of pentaquark production cross section times its branching fraction to Ξ-π+,-, relative to the cross section of the well-established Ξ(1530) resonance, are presented for neutral and doubly negative candidates with pT>2GeV/c and |y|<1 as a function of pentaquark mass. At 1862MeV/c2, these upper limits for neutral and doubly negative final states were found to be 3.2% and 1.7% at the 90% confidence level, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

For the decay t→Wb→ νb (where =e or μ), the invariant mass of the charged lepton and the bottom quark jet is sensitive to the polarization of the W boson. We determine fV+A=-0.06±0.25 given a top-quark mass of 175GeV/c2. We set an upper limit on fV+A of 0.29 at the 95% confidence level, an improvement by a factor of 2 on the previous best direct limit. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34147141823	Measurement of the top quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the decay length technique	We report the first measurement of the top quark mass using the decay length technique in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. This technique uses the measured flight distance of the b hadron to infer the mass of the top quark in lepton plus jets events with missing transverse energy. It relies solely on tracking and avoids the jet energy scale uncertainty that is common to all other methods used so far. We apply our novel method to a 695pb-1 data sample recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab and extract a measurement of mt=180.7-13.4+15.5(stat.)±8.6(syst.)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty of this result is larger than that of other measurements, the dominant uncertainties in the decay length technique are uncorrelated with those in other methods. This result can help reduce the overall uncertainty when combined with other existing measurements of the top quark mass. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34047113249	Search for anomalous production of multilepton events in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report a search for the anomalous production of events with multiple charged leptons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 346pb-1 collected by the CDFII detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The search is divided into three-lepton and four-or-more-lepton data samples. We observe six events in the three-lepton sample and zero events in the 4-lepton sample. Both numbers of events are consistent with standard model background expectations. Within the framework of an R-parity-violating supergravity model, the results are interpreted as mass limits on the lightest neutralino (χ 10) and chargino (χ1±) particles. For one particular choice of model parameters, the limits are M(χ10)>110GeV/c2 and M(χ1±)>203GeV/c2 at 95% confidence level; the variation of these mass limits with model parameters is presented. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We observe 16 WZ candidates passing our event selection with an expected background of 2.7±0.4 events. A fit to the missing transverse energy distribution indicates an excess of events compared to the background expectation corresponding to a significance equivalent to 6 standard deviations.

The analysis is performed using 310pb-1 of s=1.96TeV pp̄ collisions collected with the CDF II detector using a multijet trigger. The mass measurement is based on an event-by-event likelihood which depends on both the sample purity and the value of the top-quark mass, using 90 possible jet-to-parton assignments in the six-jet final state. The joint likelihood of 290 selected events yields a value of Mtop=177.1±4.9(stat)±4.7(syst)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We use the same selection criteria as in a previous CDF Run I search, but with an order-magnitude larger data set, a higher pp̄ collision energy, and the CDF II detector.

Many extensions to the standard model predict the production of two leptons of the same electric charge. This search has a significant increase in sensitivity compared to earlier searches. Using a data sample corresponding to 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CDF II detector, we observe no significant excess in an inclusive selection (expect 33.2±4.7 events, observe 44) or in a supersymmetry-optimized selection (expect 7.8±1.1 events, observe 13.) © 2007 The American Physical Society.

33244465223	Top quark mass measurement using the template method in the lepton+jets channel at CDF II	This article presents a measurement of the top quark mass using the CDF II detector at Fermilab. Colliding beams of protons and antiprotons at Fermilab's Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) produce top/antitop pairs, which decay to W+W-bb̄; events are selected where one W decays to hadrons and the other W decays to either e or μ plus a neutrino. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. A total of 165 tt̄ events are separated into four subsamples based on jet transverse energy thresholds and the number of b jets identified by reconstructing a displaced vertex. In each event, the reconstructed top quark invariant mass is determined by minimizing a χ2 for the overconstrained kinematic system. At the same time, the mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is measured in the same event sample. The observed W boson mass provides an in situ improvement in the determination of the hadronic jet energy scale. A simultaneous likelihood fit of the reconstructed top quark masses and the W boson invariant masses in the data sample to distributions from simulated signal and background events gives a top quark mass of 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The background from nonprompt sources is determined using a statistical method based on differences in the electromagnetic showers.

33644951561	Measurement of the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays	We measure the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays using 360pb-1 of p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the CDFÂ II detector. The spectrum is fit with predictions for odd C-parity (S13, P11, and DJ3) charmonia decaying to J/ψπ+π-, as well as even C-parity states in which the pions are from ρ0 decay. The latter case also encompasses exotic interpretations, such as a D0D̄*0 molecule. Only the S13 and J/ψρ hypotheses are compatible with our data. Since S13 is untenable on other grounds, decay via J/ψρ is favored, which implies C=+1 for the X(3872). Models for different J/ψ-ρ angular momenta L are considered. Flexibility in the models, especially the introduction of ρ-ω interference, enables good descriptions of our data for both L=0 and 1. © 2006 The American Physical Society.
