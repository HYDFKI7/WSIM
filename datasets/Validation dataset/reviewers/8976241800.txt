84929939389	Design and implementation of a voip broadcasting service over embedded systems in a heterogeneous network environment	As the digitization is integrated into daily life, media including video and audio are heavily transferred over the Internet nowadays. Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP), the most popular and mature technology, becomes the focus attracting many researches and investments. However, most of the existing studies focused on a one-to-one communication model in a homogeneous network, instead of one-to-many broadcasting model among diverse embedded devices in a heterogeneous network. In this paper, we present the implementation of a VoIP broadcasting service on the open source - Linphone - in a heterogeneous network environment, including WiFi, 3G, and LAN networks. The proposed system featuring VoIP broadcasting over heterogeneous networks can be integrated with heterogeneous agile devices, such as embedded devices or mobile phones. VoIP broadcasting over heterogeneous networks can be integrated into modern smartphones or other embedded devices; thus when users run in a traditional AM/FM signal unreachable area, they still can receive the broadcast voice through the IP network. Also, comprehensive evaluations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed implementation.

84936888244	Prolonging WSN lifetime with data-location similarity and weakest node protection	Each sensor node in a wireless sensor network (WSN) mainly consumes energy to sense the environment and convey or relay the sensed data to a sink node. Once the resident energy in a sensor node is drained, this may cause incomplete sensing coverage, resulting in WSN failure. The lifetime of a network begins when the network starts working and ends when the first node becomes ineffective from energy exhaustion caused by any of the sensor nodes in the WSN. This paper proposes a scheme that clusters sensor nodes by node reading and by node location. By using the resident energy and coverage of each node, the scheme proposes a weakest node protection mechanism to balance the energy consumed by each node, to extend the network's lifetime. The evaluation results validate the proposed concept and show the proposed scheme can even obtain additional 12.5% network lifetime compared to other existing ones.

Traditionally rendering and accessing blogs are normally conducted at a stationary PC. However, such a scheme hinders blog users from writing and reading blogs timely. A short-lived idea came out and passed away suddenly. To facilitate the instant blog updating and retrieving, we combined cellular messaging (SMS/MMS messaging and MMS/WAP push) and Open Sources (Blosxom and Apache) to develop a novel system for the Blog Rendering and Accessing INstantly (BRAINS). BRAINS enables blog users to note down their whims and share interests anytime and anywhere. Blog journalists can utilize their mobile phones in hand to compose and deliver blogs to BRAINS by SMS and MMS messaging at their pleasure. Through pre-registering on BRAINS, readers also can get the up-to-date blogs or notification immediately by MMS push or WAP push respectively. With pervasive networks, BRAINS makes mobile blog rendering and accessing more evident. © 2005 IEEE.

33749065340	Improving AAA message forwarding lookup latency for WLAN roaming in cellular/PWLAN environment	Public WLAN (PWLAN) stands a predominant position to embrace the wireless broadband era. Under the B3G vision, cellular operators (like Vodafone, T-Mobile) construct such a complementary environment to supplement the limited data access service (like GPRS or UMTS). Additionally, confederating sprinkled PWLAN operators under the WLAN roaming agreements can intensify the PWLAN service coverage. Therefore, lots of RADIUS-based Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) messages traverse among pan-PWLAN operators including PWLAN operators, Cellular/PWLAN operators and WLAN roaming brokers. In this article, we aim to improve the message forwarding lookup latency by a hashing-based scheme against the traditional one by a linear scheme. For the collision resolution in hashing, we use the customer bases of different partners as weights to construct a descending chained list to eliminate the overhead. Simulation results depict that the proposed scheme can effectively decrease the consumed time of deciding how to forward messages compared to the conventional approach. © 2006 IEEE.

77954132743	Design and implementation of Video on Demand services over a peer-to-peer multioverlay network	Video-on-Demand (VoD) services using peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies benefit by balancing load among clients and maximizing their bandwidth utilization to reduce the burden on central video servers with the single point of failure. Conventional P2P techniques for realizing VoD services only consider data between active peers in the same VoD session. They never consider those inactive peers that have left the session but may still hold partial media content in their local storage. In this article, we propose a novel architecture to construct a fully decentralized P2P overlay network for VoD streaming services based on a multioverlay concept. The architecture is referred to as MegaDrop. It not only takes the types of peers into consideration but also provides mechanisms for discovering nodes that may contain desired media objects. Such a P2P-based scheme can distribute media among peers, allow peers to search for a specific media object over the entire network efficiently, and stream the media object from a group of the peers. We employ a layered architecture consisting of four major tiers: Peer Discovery Layer, Content Lookup Layer, Media Streaming Layer, and Playback Control Layer. The evaluation results show that our architecture is particularly efficient for huge media delivery and multiuser streaming sessions.

80052495464	Design of a time and location based One-Time Password authentication scheme	As the mobile networks are springing up, mobile devices become a must gadget in our daily life. People can easily access Internet application services anytime and anywhere via the hand-carried mobile devices. Most of modern mobile devices are equipped with a GPS module, which can help get the real-time location of the mobile device. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme which exploits volatile passwords - One-Time Passwords (OTPs) based on the time and location information of the mobile device to transparently and securely authenticate users while accessing Internet services, such as online banking services and e-commerce transactions. Compared to a permanent password base scheme, an OTP based one can prevent users from being eavesdropped. In addition to a memoryless feature, the scheme restricts the validness of the OTP password not only in a certain time period but also in a tolerant geometric region to increase the security protection. However, if a legitimate user is not in the anticipated tolerant region, the user may fail to be authenticated. Hence, a Short Message Service (SMS) based mutual authentication mechanism is also proposed in the article to supplement the unexpected misjudgement. The proposed method with a volatile time/location-based password features more secure and more convenient for user authentication. © 2011 IEEE.

84861884370	WuKong: A practical video streaming service based on native BitTorrent and scalable video coding	Many researches on peer-to-peer video streaming have focused on dealing with highly dynamic, high-churn P2P environment. Most of P2P streaming protocols were modified from a P2P file sharing protocol. Inspired by the high performance on peer-to-peer file sharing of BitTorrent, we propose an overlaying streaming mechanism on the native BitTorrent protocol and realize a practical P2P video streaming service, called WuKong. WuKong not only takes advantages of BitTorrent but also combines the video scalability of layered video coding. In this paper, we depict an overlaid streaming mechanism in WuKong and an adaptive layer-downloading process to balance between the video quality and bandwidth utilization on heterogeneous peers. WuKong is carried out by using an open-sourced library of the BitTorrent protocol, coding schemes of the Windows Media Video (WMV), and the Scalable Video Coding (SVC). We measured and compared the service quality of end-users served by WuKong on heterogeneous peers. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of WuKong with peers that are randomly joining and leaving the P2P network. The results show that WuKong not only provides high quality P2P video streaming services but also supports different scaling abilities over heterogeneous devices. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

56749173468	An autonomous wireless sensor network with fault resilience	Wireless sensor networks have been practically applied to many fields including industry, science and environment monitoring. A traditional wireless sensor network is made of several distributed sensors and one sink. The sink gathers and analyzes the data from sensors and then makes some actuator take the corresponding action accordingly. A sensor-sink based architecture is vulnerable to a single-point of failure problem. If a sensor does not have a direct link with the sink, it must deliver data by hopping through other sensors. The sink may take a longer time to collect data and even make a decision. On the other hand, unexpected faulty sensors may result in an incorrect diagnosis. Based on above, we propose an autonomous wireless sensor network where regional sensors determine the local action based on the local measurements to raise the efficiency of action taking and use a consensus problem based algorithm to raise its fault resilience. In this article, we also prove correctness of the proposed scheme and analyze its computation complexity. © 2008 IEEE.

57849095026	Empirical analysis of authentication process in a cooperative B3G network	Under the B3G vision, cellular operators construct a complementary environment - Public WLAN to make up for the limited data access service to become Cellular/PWLAN operators. In addition, confederating various PWLAN operators including PWLAN operators, Cellular/PWLAN operators and PWLAN roaming brokers under the PWLAN roaming agreements can intensify the PWLAN service coverage. To build a better PWLAN access service, the group formed by heterogeneous PWLAN roaming partners is markedly growing. Authentication process in such a cooperative service plays the foremost role for users and conducts lots of back-and-forth authentication messages transmitted among PWLAN partners. To better understand the nuts and bolts of the authentication operation in a cooperative B3G network, this article aims to analyze the authentication process empirically by some experiment results.

58449133141	Fault detecting scheme for unstructured P2P network systems	The success of P2P network systems relies on the ability to distribute content quickly by utilizing the capacity of all peers. If all peers are willing to share their resources and cooperate with other peers, the performance of the system can be improved. Regrettably, some peers may be untrustworthy and unwilling to cooperate with others. Meanwhile, some peers may attack the network to degrade the efficiency. Therefore, it is very important to find a reliable mechanism to detect and eliminate faulty peers. In this study, the proposed scheme and rule allow each peer to recognize faulty peers even when there are peers leaving or joining. Basically, the protocol applies the classic concepts of Byzantine Agreement (BA) problems to assure that each peer can acquire a common set of faulty peers. Additionally, no non-faulty peers would be misjudged as faulty peers. By carrying out the proposed protocol, the faulty peers can be found and eliminated, as well as the performance of the P2P network systems can be recovered. © 2008 IADIS.

67049165159	Design and implementation of a low cost DNS-based load balancing solution for the SIP-based VoIP service	Compared to the voice service over PSTN, people look forward to a competent Voice over IP (VoIP) service. The introduction of the SIP protocol has a profound impact on the VoIP world. Exploiting more SIP proxy servers can raise the service availability. However,how to assure the efficiency and availability of the service by such an improvement becomes a challenging issue. Based on above, we propose a probingbased name resolution scheme to achieve high availability and load balance for the SIP-based VoIP service. The idea is based on intercepting the prerequisite name resolution process in a typical client-server application in the IP network. We tag the probing mechanism onto the open source project Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) to become a domain name resolution based load balancer (DN-LB). By our scheme, all SIP request messages from the SIP clients can be fairly distributed to a failure-proof SIP proxy server in the server farm without the necessity of using any additional costly intermediate network devices and changing the standard SIP architecture. Therefore, DN-LB can increase the service. reliability and fault tolerance with a low cost for the SIPbased VoIP service. © 2008 IEEE.

Since there is no need to send the detected value from distributed sensors to a central sink, our scheme can conduct a quick and direct action taking. Additionally, distributed computing in such an autonomous local wireless sensor network can endure limited faulty sensors and environment interference.

70349497450	Improving adaptive streaming service across wired/wireless networks	Thanks to the growing of the wireless networks, the video streaming application becomes a ubiquitous joyful service. In wireless communication networks, the service traffic spans across the wired and wireless domains. Hence, the service of quality (QoS) control becomes complicated. Generally, the QoS is manipulated by the receiving feedback from the mobile User Equipments (UEs) to the streaming server. If the feedback latency can be shortened, the streaming service can be adapted according to the individual network condition timely. Meanwhile, a public streaming service is normally realized by multiple uni-casting streams instead of the multicasting ones over IP. To make the service more efficient, an input video session can be encoded as multiplequality streams so that some UEs with a similar receiving condition can share streams with the same service quality. In this article, SPONGE (Stream Pooler Over a Network Graded Environment) is proposed to improve the adaptive streaming service across wired/wireless networks. SPONGE can alleviate the direct load from the original streaming server to the end UEs and make each UE get an adaptive streaming service according to its network condition timely by the reduced feedback latency of network conditions. Our simulation results show that SPONGE can react to network condition accurately and quickly so as to have a smooth and better playback quality at the end user site across wired/wireless networks. © 2009 IEEE.

77951268922	Improving robustness in an autonomous local sensor network	A traditional wireless sensor network is composed of several sensors and a sink. The sink analyzes data measured by the distributed sensors and takes appropriate action. A problem with this kind of architecture is that it may have a single-point of failure. Also, sensors are not connected directly to the sink and must send data by hopping through other sensors. This means that it would take more time for the sink to collect data. In a wireless sensor network, noise may distort the message during transmission. An intruder may also alter the message maliciously. So far, there has been little research done on the design of robust wireless sensor networks to overcome the single-point of failure problem and environmental interference. In this study, we propose a consensus problem algorithm based solution to enhance the accuracy of the detected result in an autonomous local sensor network without a centralized sink. Under our scheme, there is no need to send the detected value to the sink. The solution can therefore reduce the transmission and routing time, allowing appropriate action to be made directly and quickly. ©2010 IEEE.

77953973974	On the capacity of tree-based p2p streaming systems	The success of P2P file sharing systems inspired the development of P2P streaming systems for delivering online multimedia service in the last few years. The capacity of P2P streaming systems, i.e., how many peers can be concurrently serviced by the system, depends on system configurations including network bandwidth, overlay network formation, QoS constraints, membership management, peer selection, subscribing/ publishing scheduling, coding schemes, etc. Due to the complexity, there are not too many systematical studies on system capacity. This work is our first attempt to answer this question. Based on Bow concepts, we compare the capacity of single-tree P2P streaming systems and multiple-tree P2P streaming systems. The delay issues are not considered here. We prove that finding the routing tree to maximize system capacity, no matter for either single-tree systems or multipletree systems, is NP-hard. Two generic network formation heuristics, one for single-tree topology and the other for multiple-tree topology, are proposed. Simulation results show that since multiple-tree topology can efficiently utilize upload bandwidth, the multiple-tree systems have potential to service more clients. © 2010 IEEE.

However, such a visualizing process is not suitable to broadcast real-time SMS/MMS messages to people in public. To facilitate the instancy and publicity, we develop a real-time information aggregator-Visualizing SMS and MMS Messages System (VSMMS)-to realize the concept by integrating SMS and MMS messaging over GSM/GPRS/UMTS onto a remote display device. The device exhibits messages on a larger display device in public. VSMMS features a revolutionized variation of mass media broadcasting.

In addition to the SQL technique, Map-Reduce, a programming model that realizes implementing large-scale data processing, has been a hot topic that is widely discussed through many studies. Many real-world tasks such as data processing for search engines can be parallel-implemented through a simple interface with two functions called Map and Reduce. In this paper, we focus on comparing the performance of the Hadoop implementation of Map-Reduce with SQL Server though simulations. In our studies, Hadoop can complete the same query faster than a SQL Server. On the other hand, some concerned factors are also tested to see whether they would affect the performance for Hadoop or not. We also find that more machines included for data processing can make Hadoop achieve a better performance, especially for a large-scale data set. © 2010 IEEE.

79951512806	Resource searching in an unstructured P2P network based on cloning random walker assisted by dominating set	Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have been developed for resource sharing for years. In a P2P network, the first and foremost challenge is resource searching to find out target objects (i.e., data, file, etc.) scattered in the P2P network. The searching efficiency highly depends on the popularity of the target object. However, the popularity is too variable to be estimated since a P2P network is dynamic. A good searching scheme in such a variable environment with a better trade-off among long searching time, a large amount of duplicated query messages and a low successful search hit rate is hard to be determined. Many efficient methods have been proposed to resolve this issue. Most of them may only be beneficial for searching a popular object. In this paper, we propose a Cloning Random Walker assisted by Dominating Set (CloneRW + DS) method to adaptively locate the target object no matter the target object is popular or unpopular in a P2P network. Our theoretical analysis shows that our proposed method consumes a moderate amount of query messages between the message amount in the Random Walker method and the one in the flooding method. Additionally, our simulation results also depict that our proposed scheme can perform a better trade-off among the search delay, message overhead per hit and success rate while conducting resource searching in a P2P network. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79955700729	Recognition assisted dynamic surveillance system based on OSGi and OpenCV	Thanks to the Internet development, a surveillance user can monitor the distant events via a browser on a computer. These events can be even viewed on a mobile phone with the assistance from modern mobile networks. Besides, two well-known platforms - OSGi and OpenCV are widely used for application construction. OSGi is constructed to provide a service platform with high application interoperability while OpenCV is used to provide a bundle of application programming interfaces (APIs) about image processing. In this paper, we design a recognition assisted surveillance system based on OSGi service platform and the OpenCV development platform.

79955704556	On transmission efficiency of the multimedia service over IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks	Multimedia services over resource constrained Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) face a performance bottleneck issue from the gateway node to the sink node. Therefore, the queue management at the gateway node is crucial for diversified messages conveyed from the front nodes to the sink node. In this study, we focus on the performance improvement upon different traffic loads over WSNs. A dynamic adaptation scheme based on adjusting Beacon Interval (BI) and Superframe Duration (SD) in the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC superframe accompanied with RED (Random Early Detection) queue management scheme is proposed to increase the transmission efficiency of multimedia over WSNs. Evaluation metrics include end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption in IEEE 802.15.4 beacon enabled and non-beacon enabled mode. Simulation results show that RED scheme accompanied with an appropriate setting of BO, SO value can effectively decrease end-to-end delay and energy consumption compared to the DropTail (FIFO) scheme. © 2011 Global IT Research Inst.

79959542575	Inexpensive high availability solutions for the SIP-based VoIP service	In the era of IP-based service, people expect a simple, cheap, and competent Voice over IP (VoIP) service as an alternative of the traditional voice over PSTN. The introduction of the SIP protocol realizes the expectation. Following the cost saving spirit of VoIP, we focus on studying inexpensive high availability solutions for the SIP-based VoIP Service. In this paper, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) based and DN-LB based schemes are mainly compared in the paper. A P2P-based scheme enables an inexpensive high availability solution to the VoIP service by the shared computation resources form P2P nodes. Such a P2P-based solution may be appropriate for an individual VoIP user. However, a caller may take a large volume of messages to find out a callee via the proxy nodes in the P2P network. This inherent property of a P2P network may induce the message overhead and long call setup delay. Based on above, another inexpensive scheme, which is a probingbased name resolution solution, is proposed to achieve high availability and load balancing for the VoIP service. We tag the probing mechanism onto the open source project Domain Name Relay Daemon (DNRD) to become a domain name resolution based load balancer (DN-LB). With DN-LB, all request messages from clients can be fairly distributed to all failure-proof proxy servers in the server farm without using any additional costly intermediate network device and changing the standard SIP architecture. Such a DN-LB based solution may be a good choice for a VoIP service provider. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

79959770700	TRASS: A transmission rate-adapted streaming server in a wireless environment	The video streaming quality in a wireless communication network environment is largely affected by various network characteristics, such as a limited channel bandwidth and a variant transmission rate. The playback quality of User Equipments (UEs) may not be smooth when the service is delivered via a wireless environment. From the viewpoints of most video receivers, a smooth playback with a lower video quality may be more significant than a lagged or distorted playback with a higher video quality as the transmission rate degrades. Based on the above, we sketch an adaptation agent Transmission-Rate Adapted Streaming Server (TRASS), which is located between the original video server and UEs, to adaptively transform the streaming video based on the real transmission rate. In our proposed scheme, UEs would feedback their network access statuses to TRASS and then TRASS would deliver adaptive quality of video streams to UEs according to their feedbacks. The theoretical analysis and simulations using different video tracks encoded in MPEG-4 and H.264/AVC formats show that TRASS can help wireless streaming users to get a smooth playback quality with a lower packet failure rate. With a low probability of receiving a worse quality of video, users' Quality of Experience can subsequently be raised. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

80051523258	MegaDrop: A cooperative video-on-demand system in a Peer-to-Peer environment	In a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) environm ent, which can im prove scalability and lessen bandwidth waste, the load of the Video- on-demand (VoD) services can be distributed to reduce the burden on centralized video server s and maximize the bandwidth utilization. Conventional P2P techniques for VoD services only consider data between active peer s in the same VoD session. The inactive peers that leave the session but still hold some of the media content in their local storage are ignored. In this article, we design and im plement a fully decentralized VoD service via P2P techniques, which is ref erred to as the MegaDrop system. The MegaDrop system not only takes active peers into consideration but also provides mechanisms for discovering inactive peers that contain desired media objects. Evaluation results of the M egaDrop system show that our architecture performs more efficiently when the more inactive peers involving to provide media blocks.

80052431576	Virtual Grouping Byzantine Agreement: A compromised consensus scheme for a cooperative network	In a cooperative network environment, each independent node communicates with others by some agreement mechanism to make sure the majority of nodes can actuate a common corresponding action. Byzantine Agreement (BA) has been proved to effectively make all healthy nodes obey the same command issued from the commander node. The major challenge for BA is its considerable amount of exchange messages among nodes to reach the consensus, especially when BA is applied to a network environment which comprises lots of cooperative nodes. Based on above, we propose a Virtual Grouping Byzantine Agreement (VGBA) scheme to compromise between the percentage of nodes which can obtain the common command and the number of exchange messages. VGBA may suffer a lowered tolerance capability of faulty nodes and a lowered percentage of healthy nodes having the command but significantly reduce the message volume so that the improved scheme is applicable while facing a larger number of nodes. The theoretical inferences and evaluation results show that the proposed scheme provides an effective trade-off solution to the agreement problem among cooperative distributed nodes in terms of message volume and fault tolerance in an autonomous network. © 2011 IEEE.

80053243990	Improving the Internet protocol-based authentication process in a cooperative beyond third-generation network	Under the beyond third-generation (B3G) vision, cellular operators (like Vodafone, T-mobile) construct a complementary environment - public wireless local area network (PWLAN) to compensate for the limited data access service to become cellular/PWLAN operators. In addition, PWLAN service coverage can be improved by bringing together various types of PWLAN operators, including PWLAN operators, cellular/PWLAN operators and PWLAN roaming brokers under PWLAN roaming agreements. To build a better PWLAN access service, the group formed by heterogeneous PWLAN roaming partners is markedly growing. In such a cooperative service, the user authentication process plays a foremost role for users and involves many back-and-forth authentication message transmissions among the PWLAN partners. Some factors causing the authentication delay are hard to be further improved, such as the authentication network condition since the networks are owned by many PWLAN partners and scattered in the Internet. If the Internet protocol (IP) lookup time for the authentication server can be shortened, the efficiency for the IP-based authentication process can be made. In this article, an improved mechanism for reducing the IP lookup latency prior to conveying authentication messages is presented. With theoretical analyses and simulation results, the proposed scheme can improve the authentication process in a cooperative B3G network. © 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

80053575524	On utilization efficiency of backbone bandwidth for a heterogeneous wireless network operator	To provide a comprehensive network access service to wireless users, a network operator may operate different types of wireless networks (such as GPRS, Wi-Fi, HSDPA, UMTS, WiMAX and 3GPP LTE) simultaneously to become a heterogeneous wireless network operator, such as Vodafone and T-Mobile. With convenience of accessing wireless networks, ubiquitous services would stimulate the bandwidth expenditure in the network backbone. Lots of various demanded traffic from heterogeneous access networks may converge toward Internet through the common backbone in the operator. Efficiently utilizing the common backbone can offer a better quality of service to users and maximize the revenues for the operator. To our best knowledge, few studies had ever been made in such a contemporary wireless network environment in the past. In this study, we propose solutions to efficiently allocate the bandwidth for user requests and fully utilize the unused bandwidth in the network backbone owned by the heterogeneous wireless network operator. Our simulation results show that our scheme can increase the utilization of the backbone bandwidth, shorten the request completion time for users and generate more revenue for the operator. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Large scale cyber physical system (LCPS) must have enough computing power for processing all real-time sensed data from sensor devices. LCPS can deploy a cloud platform to increase its computing power. The cloud based LCPS then serves these requests at the same time by well arranging sensor tasks based on the arrival time. Hence, cloud service can obtain better performance and more efficiency when good scheduling algorithms are implemented. In this paper, apply the early deadline first until zero laxity (EDZL) scheduling algorithm to optimize the cloud service scheduler for ensuring sensor jobs do not miss deadline in the LCPS. © 2011 IEEE.

The TBRA is a routing selection strategy based on the concept of the ant colony optimization algorithm. It is difficult to establish and maintain optimal routes in a 3D space because the RSSI, energy of sensor nodes, vary with time. This routing selection strategy can be used for various traffic conditions by measuring and counting the average energy of nodes, RSSI value.

84864271300	Adaptive weighted scheme for improving mobile sensor node connectivity in IEEE 802.15.4 networks	Conventional IEEE802.15.4 wireless sensor network is suitable for fixed sensor nodes. However, there are some issues with mobile sensor nodes joining or leaving the sensor network since the mobile sensor node is easier to lose its connectivity compared to the fixed sensor nodes. In order to regain its connectivity, the mobile sensor nodes must spend more time and energy to perform the re-association procedure, resulting in an efficiency decay of the sensor network. To solve this problem, we refer to the previous research to design an adaptive weighted link quality indicator prediction based scheme in the media access layer. The proposed scheme can reduce the non-connectivity time of mobile sensor node by early performing the re-association procedure. Additionally, we design a simple procedure to lessen the Ping-Pong effect problem without additional computation overhead, thereby improving stability of the connection between the mobile sensor node and its corresponding coordinator. © 2012 IEEE.

The procedure that a server authenticates a remote user securely has become a significant issue. Hence, many remote user authentication schemes are proposed. Hsiang and Shih pointed out the weaknesses of Yoon et al.'s scheme and proposed an improved scheme not only preserving original merits but also mending the weaknesses. The scheme protects against masquerading attacks, offline password guessing attacks and parallel session attacks. However, He et al. found that Hsiang et al.'s scheme is still vulnerable to password guessing attack, masquerading server attack and masquerading attack. Furthermore, we also found Hsiang-Shih's scheme could be threatened by a malicious insider that can originate an infringed account attack and a resembling account attack. In this paper, we first describe how a malicious insider carries out an infringed account attack and then present a resembling account attack on Hsiang-Shih's scheme. After that, we propose an improvement assisted by hashing functions to enhance Hsiang-Shih's scheme. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With the GPS signal strength hindered by the structure, indoor users cannot obtain their positions through their handheld devices. Indoor positioning has recently been conducted based on received signal strength (RSS) fingerprint from indoor wireless access devices. Integrating indoor position information with Smartphone can provide more precise in-building information. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning scheme assisted by a RSS fingerprint and footprint architecture. Smartphone users can get their position based on RSSs from ambient Wi-Fi access points surrounding them. With the assistance of collecting RSSs from ambient Wi-Fi signals, confining RSSs by directions, and filtering burst noises, our propose scheme can overcome the severe signal fluctuation problem in the building. Meanwhile, the proposed RSS fingerprint and footprint matching mechanism can raise the accuracy of location estimation. The experiment results show that our proposed scheme can achieve a certain level of accuracy in the indoor environments and outperform other solutions. © 2012 IEEE.

In a heterogeneous network environment, cameras and viewers are located in different networks so that frame synchronization may span across diverse network domains with different transmission capabilities. The mismatch of transmission capabilities may affect the viewing continuity and playback liveness between cameras and viewers. In the article, we propose an adaptive frame synchronization mechanism for frame capturing at cameras based on the network condition to improve the frame synchronization between two sides across a heterogeneous network. Based on a brief theoretical analysis of the asynchronization effect for video communication in a heterogeneous network environment, the proposed adaptive pause time mechanism can be an effective solution to relieve the asynchronization effect in the unmatched transmission rate situation. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve a shorter time delay between the captured frames at the camera site and the viewer site. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

WSNs are easy to deploy and have wide range of applications. Therefore, in distributed and unattended locations, WSNs are deployed to allow a legitimated user to login to the network and access data. Consequently, the authentication between users and sensor nodes has become one of the important security issues. In 2009, M. L. Das proposed a two-factor authentication for WSNs. Based on one-way hash function and exclusive-OR operation, the scheme is well-suited for resource constrained environments. Later, Khan and Algahathbar pointed out the flaws and vulnerabilities of Das's scheme and proposed an alternative scheme. However, Vaidya et al. found that both Das's and Khan-Algahathbar's schemes are vulnerable to various attacks including stolen smart card attacks. Further, Vaidya et al. proposed an improved two-factor user authentication to overcome the security weakness of both schemes. In this paper, we show that Vaidya et al.'s scheme still exposes to a malicious insider attack that seriously threatens the security of WSNs. We hope that by identifying this vulnerability, similar schemes can avoid these weaknesses. © 2013 IEEE.

The important factor affects the performance in MANET is discovering and maintaining paths since the node's mobility causes topology change, which needs to be observed for effective communication. One of the popular studies for routing in the networks in recent years is the swarm intelligence which imitates the collective behavior of biological species to solve routing problems in the networks. Another efficient method is clustering scheme which can be auxiliary structure to cluster nodes in the network. In this paper, we use weakly connected dominating sets (WCDS) which clusters network by node's maximum degree or minimum ID to propose an improved ant-based on-demand clustering routing (AOCR) protocol. AOCR uses ant-like agents inspired by the foraging behavior of ant colonies to explore networks and discover a route which fulfills several QoS requirements including minimal traffic overhead or energy-efficiency for MANET. Simulations on NS-2 show that our proposed scheme can effectively be applied in MANET to achieve a high packet delivery ratio, a low end-to-end delay with just a little increased energy. © 2013 IEEE.

Under a constraint on the amount of faulty nodes, the classical solution, Byzantine Agreement (BA), has been proved to effectively make all healthy nodes able to obey the same command issued from the commander node. The major challenge for BA is its considerable amount of exchanged messages among nodes to reach the consensus, especially when BA is applied to a network environment, which comprises a lot of cooperative nodes. Such a situation may hinder BA from being practically applied in the modern network environment, such as an autonomous wireless sensor network. Thus, we propose a Virtual Grouping Byzantine Agreement (VGBA) scheme to compromise between the percentage of nodes, which can obtain the common command, and the number of exchanged messages produced in the network. That means that VGBA may suffer a lower tolerance capability of faulty nodes and a lower percentage of healthy nodes having the command, but it significantly reduces the message volume. Consequently, the improved VGBA scheme is still applicable while facing a larger number of nodes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, the IEEE 802.16e/m standard presents three power-saving classes that can be associated with different types of network connections to decrease the power consumption of mobile stations. However, previous studies failed to fully use the sleep-mode features to save energy of a mobile station while simultaneously maintaining unicast and multicast/broadcast connections. This study proposes an energy-efficient packet scheduling algorithm for both multicast and broadcast services that does not violate the QoS requirements of real-time connections. The proposed activity aggregation selection mechanism approach can minimize total power consumption of mobile stations in one cell and simultaneously satisfy the QoS of real-time connections. This method improves energy efficiency for IEEE 802.16e/m and the activity aggregation selection mechanism approach can optimize sleeping mode features to save the energy of mobile stations with overlapping connection packets The simulations in this study verified the proposed approach.

84893702751	A time and location information assisted OTP scheme	As the mobile networks are springing up, mobile devices become a must gadget in our daily life. People can easily access Internet application services anytime and anywhere via the hand-carried mobile devices. Most of modern mobile devices are equipped with a GPS module, which can help get the real-time location of the mobile device. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme which exploits volatile passwords-One- Time Passwords (OTPs) based on the time and location information of the mobile device to transparently and securely authenticate users while accessing Internet services, such as online banking services and e-commerce transactions. Compared to a permanent password base scheme, an OTP based one can prevent users from being eavesdropped. In addition to a memoryless feature, the scheme restricts the validness of the OTP password not only in a certain time period but also in a tolerant geometric region to increase the security protection. However, if a legitimate user is not in the anticipated tolerant region, the user may fail to be authenticated. Hence, a Short Message Service based mutual authentication mechanism is also proposed in the article to supplement the unexpected misjudgement. The proposed method with a volatile time/location-based password features more secure and more convenient for user authentication. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

Absolutely, legitimate users are more powerful attackers, since they possess internal system information not available to an intruder. Therefore many remote user authentication schemes for distributed systems have been proposed. These schemes claimed that they could resist various attacks. However, they were found to have some weaknesses later. Lee et al. proposed a secure dynamic ID-based remote user authentication scheme for the multi-server environment using smart cards and claimed that their scheme could protect against masquerade attacks, server spoofing attack, registration server spoofing attack and insider attack. In this study, the authors show that Lee et al.'s scheme is still vulnerable to password guessing attack, server spoofing attack and masquerade attack. To propose a viable authentication scheme for distributed systems, we remedy the flaws of Lee et al.'s scheme and propose an efficient improvement over Lee et al.'s scheme. Furthermore, we compare the proposed scheme with related ones to prove that the computation cost, security and efficiency of the proposed scheme are well suitable for practical applications in a distributed system. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.

The simulation results depict that the HS+DW-DLC scheme can reduce the average searching delay time by more than 90% even in a information-scarce social network which only 8% of total nodes can provide the target information. Meanwhile, HS+DW-DLC can generate a lowest average message overhead, which may burden the network, compared to other schemes. © 2013 IEEE.

84903592106	Non-parametric RSS prediction based energy saving scheme for moving smartphones	With the emergence of WiFi technology and network-based applications, the computing, communication and sensing capabilities of smartphones are increasing rapidly, and the smartphone has emerged as a particularly appealing platform for pervasive network applications. However, WiFi entails considerable energy consumption on these battery-powered devices. Finding ways to reduce power consumption on smartphones becomes a critical issue. In this paper, we propose an adaptive limit-rate selection algorithm based on anon-parametric signal strength prediction scheme and analyze its potential for energy savings. By periodically monitoring the received signal strength (RSS) in diverse network environments, the proposed scheme applies weighted scatter plot smoothing and kernel moving average algorithms to adaptively adjust file downloading and video streaming rates. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can save 5.7% energy at least and 13.9% energy at most compared to non-adaptive and non-prediction schemes when the smartphone holders use the applications on the move. © 2013 IEEE.

84904050844	P2P resource searching with cloning random walker assisted by weakly connected dominating set	Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks feature resource sharing in a distributed network environment. How to efficiently find out target objects (i.e., data, file, etc.) distributed in a P2P network is the remarkable process for resource sharing. The searching efficiency highly depends on the popularity of the target object. However, the popularity varies since peer joining or leaving a P2P network is very dynamic. Many researches aimed at finding a good searching scheme in such a variable environment with a better trade-off among long searching time, a large amount of duplicated query messages and a low successful search hit rate. In this paper, we propose a Cloning Random Walker assisted by Weakly Connected Dominating Set (CloneRW+WCDS) method to adaptively locate the target object in a P2P network. Our simulation results also depict that our proposed scheme can perform a better trade-off among the search delay, message overhead per hit and success rate while conducting resource searching in a P2P network. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84904857018	Ambient mesoscale weather forecasting system featuring mobile augmented reality	With rapid development of mobile technologies, people can easily obtain surrounding information through their mobile devices. Meanwhile, weather forecasting information is important for many people in the daily life. Most of current weather information systems only illustrate the basic weather information, such as the temperature and the precipitation probability, by a simple text-based or graphic-based presentation without involving too much environmental information. To integrate weather information with ambient intelligence, this paper aims at showing our implementation experience about how to realize our ambient mesoscale weather forecasting system (AMWFS). With an augmented reality presentation in the system, a more intuitive navigation interface provides users a new way of accessing weather information. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84907590232	An anonymous mobile user authentication protocol using self-certified public keys based on multi-server architectures	As a smart phone becomes a daily necessity, mobile services are springing up. A mobile user should be authenticated and authorized before accessing these mobile services. Generally, mobile user authentication is a method which is used to validate the legitimacy of a mobile login user. As the rapid booming of computer networks, multi-server architecture has been pervasive in many network environments. Much recent research has been focused on proposing password-based remote user authentication protocols using smart cards for multi-server environments. To protect the privacy of users, many dynamic identity based remote user authentication protocols were proposed. In 2009, Hsiang and Shih claimed their protocol is efficient, secure, and suitable for the practical application environment. However, Sood et al. pointed out Hsiang et al.'s protocol is susceptible to replay attack, impersonation attack and stolen smart card attack. Moreover, the password change phase of Hsiang et al.'s protocol is incorrect. Thus, Sood et al. proposed an improved protocol claimed to be practical and computationally efficient. Nevertheless, Li et al. found that Sood et al.'s protocol is still vulnerable to leak-of-verifier attack, stolen smart card attack and impersonation attack and consequently proposed an improvement to remove the aforementioned weaknesses. In 2012, Liao et al. proposed a novel pairing-based remote user authentication protocol for multi-server environment, the scheme based on elliptic curve cryptosystem is more secure and efficient. However, through careful analyses, we find that Liao et al.'s protocol is still susceptible to the trace attack. Besides, Liao et al.'s protocol is inefficient since each service server has to update its ID table periodically. In this paper, we propose an improved protocol to solve these weaknesses. By enhancing the security, the improved protocol is well suited for the practical environment.

84919706648	Improving heterogeneous SOA-based IoT message stability by shortest processing time scheduling	An Internet of Things (IoT) system features integration information from heterogeneous sensor devices, allowing them to deliver a variety of sensed information through networks. An IoT broker in the system acts as an information exchange center, relaying periodic messages from heterogeneous sensor devices to IoT clients. As more devices participate in the IoT system, the service scale of entire system increases. To overcome the limitation of the number of direct links to an single working element, the whole IoT system should be divided into many subsystems, called IoT units, to form the system hierarchy. Furthermore, applying the service-oriented architecture (SOA) concept to realize the IoT service can facilitate to adapt the future-proof devices to the IoT system. Normally, a web-based message visualization can unify the client interface in a SOA-based system. However, a large volume of web-based messages with various sizes are not easy to be stably displayed at the client side. This paper proposes an IoT system skeleton and a shortest processing time (SPT) algorithm for scheduling web-based IoT messages. The implemented scheduling scheme supported by a priority queue model can effectively stablize the response messages from the scattered IoT sensors per each client request.
