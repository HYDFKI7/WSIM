8844235041	Development of new type of wear and crack resistant hardfacing electrode	By using H08A bare electrode and the coating fluxes of ferrotitanium, rutile, graphite, calcium carbonate and calcium fluoride, a new type of wear and crack resistant hardfacing electrode was developed. The microstructure and wear properties of deposited layer were studied by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and wear test. The results indicate that TiC particles are produced by direct metallurgical reaction between ferrotitanium or rutile and graphite during welding process. TiC particles with sizes in the range of 3-5 μm are dispersed in the matrix of lath martensite and retained austenite. The deposited layer of the new type of hardfacing electrode possesses better wear and crack resistance than that of D618 and D667 hardfacing electrodes.

14844286470	Wear resistance and wear mechanism of welded surfacing layers containing internally produced carbide particulates	Welded surfacing layers containing internally produced superhard TiC and VC particulates were prepared on Q235-A alloy making use of the high temperature arc metallurgic reaction among Fe-Ti, Fe-V, graphite, and rutile, etc. The abrasive wear-resistance of the resulting welded surfacing layers was evaluated on an MLD-10 friction and wear tester, using the surfacing layer made from EDZCr-C-15 welding rod as a reference. The phase compositions and microstructures and worn surface morphology of the welded surfacing layers were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, while the macrohardness and microhardness were comparatively investigated as well. As the results, the surfacing layers containing dispersively distributed carbides particulates had much better abrasive wear-resistance than the one made from the EDZCr-C-15 welding rod, though they had a little bit larger hardness than the latter. The greatly increased wear-resistance of the welded surfacing layers containing the superhard carbides particulates was thus attributed to their special phase compositions and microstructures. Namely, the target welded surfacing layers were composed of lath martensite as the matrix which was capable of well bonding and supporting the dispersed carbides particulates and decreasing the abrasion energy by way of plastic deforming. In other words, the superhard carbides particulates and the soft lath martensite matric had well balanced hardness and toughness, which contributed to greatly increase the wear-resistance of the welded surfacing layers containing the superhard carbides particulates.

17944375932	Surfacing electrode with cracking resistance and wearability	A new surfacing electrode is developed with cracking resistance and wearability based on high microhardness of TiC and VC, carbides of Ti and V are formed in deposited metal by means of high temperature arc metallurgic reaction. The results show the hardness of surfacing metal increases with the increase of ferrotitanium (Fe-Ti), ferrovanadium (Fe-V) and graphite in the coat. However, when graphite reaches the volume fraction of 11%, the hardness reaches its peak value, and when beyond 11%, the hardness falls off. As Fe-Ti, Fe-V and graphite increase, the cracking resistance of deposited metal and usability of electrode declines. Carbides are dispersedly distributed in the matrix structure. The matrix microstructure of deposited metal is lath martensite. Carbides present irregular block. When using the researched surfacing electrode to continue weld with non-preheated, no seeable crack or only a few micro-cracks can be observed in the surface of deposited metal. The hardness is above 60 HRC. The wear resistance is better than that of EDZCr-C-15.

17144435055	Cracking morphology and fracture characteristics in the fusion zone of HQ130 steel	Cracking propagation and fracture morphology characteristics in the fusion zone of HQ130 high strength steel are studied by means of `the y-slit test', microscope and SEM. Experimental test indicated that welding crack commonly produced in the partially-melted zone at about 20 μm to approximately 60 μm from the melting line and propagated parallel to the fusion zone or turned into the weld metal. Crack propagation conducts alternatively between the weld zone and the partially-molten zone, and is not strictly to rupture at W/F boundary surface. Controlling weld heat input (≤20 kJ/cm) may avoid forming coarse lath martensite or upper bainite nearby the fusion zone, and welding crack can be effectively prevented.

0000183982	Characterization of a growth-front interface in a HPHT-grown diamond crystal by transmission electron microscopy	The growth-front interface of a diamond single crystal, which was grown from the Fe - Ni - C system under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT), has been directly observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for the first time. The presence of a cellular interface suggests that the diamond is grown from solution and there exists a narrow supercooling zone in front of the solid-liquid interface. Diamond-growth parallel layers were also found, which indicates that the diamond grows from solution layer by layer. It provides direct evidence that the diamond is synthesized through graphite dissolution and transformation to subcritical diamond particles in a molten catalyst, diamond subcritical particle connection to form diamond clusters, diffusion of the diamond clusters to the growing diamond, and unification of the diamond clusters on the growing diamond crystal.

3142645131	Twin electrode singe arc welding technology	This paper introduces the twin electrode single arc welding technology. Twin electrode single arc welding is that work-piece does not link power source, electric arc is ignited and burned between mutual insulation welding rod. The igniting and combustion of electric arc can go on in the space away from work-piece in different distance. The space between two cores of twin electrode is the key factor to control arc voltage. Adjusting the space between two cores of twin electrode and work-piece has very little influence on arc voltage. Arc voltage goes up when welding current increases. Using twin electrode of 45.6% coating weight coefficient, with Φ4 diameter, under the condition that the space between two cores is 1.2-1.7 mm and welding current is 180-220A, joints that have welded appearance and mechanical property can be gained.

Heating and melting of twin electrode	With measuring dynamic temperature change of twin electrode, the heating and melting of twin electrode single arc welding was investigated. Results show that the melting coefficient of twin electrode increases with increasing of welding current, decreasing of coating weight coefficient and decreasing of two-core span, and it is 2-3 times than that of single core electrode. During twin electrode single arc welding, the energy used for heating and melting twin electrode includes resistance heat in core rod and arc heat. The melting of the electrode mainly depends on the arc heat. When the electrode was closely used up, for the current of 200 A, the increase in temperature of TE4303 electrode was approximately 750°C.

33745948796	Melting characteristic of twin electrode single arc welding II. Self-regulating effect of arc on two cores melting	Two cores melting speed can keep consistence is very important for twin electrode single arc welding to be stabilized. The melting consistency of two cores is influenced by electrode type, welding current etc. The sufficient condition of two cores melting coincidence is the effective anode drop equal to the effective cathode drop, the more the difference of two values the more the melting inconsistent degree. The arc has a self-regulating effect on melting of two cores, that is, during the arc burning, even if the ends of two cores have different length in the arc, two cores can keep uniformly melting speed, and the arc can stably burn. The principle of the serf-regulating effect is that different heat production of cathode and anode make two cores length in the arc different. The longer weld core stretching into the arc column gets more heat from the arc column to accelerate its melting. In general, the self-regulation effect of arc increases with the reducing of two-core span and increasing of welding current.

The mixture powder of graphite and ferrotitanium (FeTi) was deposited evenly on an AISI 1045 steel substrate, which was then heated by GTAW heat source. The results showed that in situ synthesized TiC particle reinforced composite coatings can be achieved under suitable welding parameters. Cubic TiC carbides and fine needle-shape eutectic TiC carbides are formed by ternary eutectic reaction between FeTi and graphite powders. Together with these TiC carbides, radially grown dendrites of primary TiC particles are also found in the composite coatings. These TiC particles are evenly distributed in the composite coatings. Because of the generation of these carbide particles and their homogeneous distribution in the matrix, the composite coatings give very high hardness and excellent wear resistance. The wear resistance of multi-layers composite coatings is about three to four times higher than that of 1045 steel substrate. Moreover, the wear resistance of the composite coatings and the substrate increased with increasing wear sliding distance. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The microstructure and wear properties of the composite coatings were investigated by means of an electron microprobe microanalysis (EPMA), X-ray diffractometer and wear tester. The results showed that the multi-pass overlapping GTAW melting surface composite coatings can be obtained under suitable welding parameters, and no crack and porosity are found in the tracks. The X-ray and EPMA results confirm that TiC particles can be formed via reaction of FeTi and graphite during multi-pass overlapping GTAW melting process. TiC particles present cubic and dendrite shape in the non-overlapping zone. It is found that there occurred TiC particles coarsening at the overlap regions, which can lead to detrimental effects on the hardness and wear performance. Composite coatings give a high hardness and excellent wear resistance; and the wear friction coefficient of the coating is less than that of the 1020 steel. As a result, multi-pass overlapping GTAW melting process can be used effectively for producing surface composite coatings with a pre-placed powder to improve wear resistance of the AISI 1020 steel. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that the arc was burning between the two wires in twin-wire indirect arc welding, and the arc was still a type of gas discharge in nature. Welding current, arc voltage and the distance between the two wires and the workpiece have great influence on the arc shape. With the welding current changing, the arc shape presents different degree of concentration and scatter. The arc becomes brighter and bigger with the increase of arc voltage. When the distance between the two wires and the workpiece reduced, the arc concentrated and became shorter and brighter. Arc voltage changes periodically, and its corresponding electric arc shape changes also periodically, and it has well corresponding relationship between arc voltage and electric arc shape.

Results have shown that there is a close relationship between the shear strength and the fracture form of brazed joints. The fracture occurring completely in the composite near the composite/filler metal interface corresponds to the low strength of a joint, and the strength of the joint fractured partially in the composite usually increases with decreasing the proportion of the composite on the fracture surface in the steel side. When the fracture occurs in the reaction layer between the composite and the filler metal, the closer the fractured position comes to the composite/reaction layer interface, the higher the joint strength. The maximum shear strength is obtained when the fracture occurs fully at the interface.

Arc voltage and arc current are measured by an oscilloscope. Main results of the experiment are summarised as follows: the TESAW arc fluctuates periodically with a period of 20-40 ms in this study and, correspondingly, arc voltage is also changed periodically. The variation in arc voltage is large, but arc current does not vary so much. Arc voltage fluctuates mainly above a certain value, corresponding to the motion of the arc under normal welding condition, but short circuiting does not occur. Arc root of TESAW locates at the droplets of the core wire tip, and the formation, growth and transformation of the droplets induce the change of arc shape and fluctuation of arc voltage. The fluctuation of arc voltage and the fusion of core wire depend on the factors such as the two core span, welding current and electrode type. ©2007 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

37349109235	Transferring mechanism of the coating rod in friction surfacing	A coating rod of 1Cr18Ni9Ti (321) was deposited on the substrate of mild steel 1020 to be able to perform a friction surfacing experiment. The temperature changes of special points on the coating rod were measured using a thermocouple. The results show that the temperature increase rate at the friction interface reached a high level at first. Then the rate decreased to a low level once the friction system became quasi-steady and the temperature became approximately stable near the melting point of the coating rod. The theory of contact melting was used to build the physical model for the quasi-liquid layer. Subsequently, the corresponding calculations were carried out. The computer simulation results are found to be consistent with the experiment results, and as such, the present study demonstrates the feasibility of applying contact melting theory to the study of friction surfacing. Likewise, this study reveals that the material at the top of the coating rod is plastic, and that it behaves as a quasi-liquid in the friction surfacing process. The study establishes the theory basis for the study of the mechanism of friction surfacing, and provides a new method for investigating other friction-welding techniques. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Results show that in situ TiC particles were prepared in the coating. The microstructure of the coating was mainly composed of ferrite, retained austenite, TiC particles and carbide. The surface hardness of the coating is higher than 55 HRC and presents gradient distribution nearer to the surface of the coating.

The results showed that the heat damage of cemented carbide was inevitable. The main characteristic of heat damage was the decompose and diffusion of carbide. The grain of fringe carbide grew up, reseparated out and a new phase was formed. The type of heat damage for WC cemented carbide was melting and dissolve of carbide, diffusion and reaction of element. The mechanism of heat damage for cemented carbide was the element diffusion and chemical reaction between cemented carbide and matrix metal. The diffused zoom and new phase were formed at the interface of cemented carbide and matrix. The kind, size, content and method of hardfaceing all directly affected the level of heat damage.

80052580074	Formation mechanism of titanium carbide crystal in laser synthesized metal-ceramic composite coating	In situ titanium carbide reinforced iron-based composite coating was deposited on mild carbon steel using laser surface engineering (LSE) with ferrotitanium and graphite as precursor. The microstructure and phase constituents of the deposited coating were characterized. Formation mechanism of titanium carbide crystal in the composite coating was elucidated by correlating the morphology of titanium carbide and the thermal cycle experienced by the precursor during the laser treatment. It was demonstrated that titanium carbide was formed in situ as a result of the metallurgical reaction between ferrotitanium and graphite following a liquid-precipitation route. Different morphologies of titanium carbide crystal (dendrite and fishbone) correspond to the primary and eutectic titanium carbide respectively. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

42449155492	Figuration control of deposit in friction surfacing	Friction Surfacing is an advanced surface modification method, so it is of great importance to study figuration mechanism of deposit in friction surfacing process for controlling deposit's quality. By friction surfacing, consumable-rod of 1Cr18Ni9Ti (321)was surfaced on the substrate of mild steel (1020) by different process parameters (rotation speed, force and traverse speed). The effects of process parameters on deposit's figuration are discussed. Experiments show that deposit's width and thickness decrease linearly with increasing consumable-rod rotation speed; deposit's width increases and its thickness decreases with increasing force. If traverse speed between substrate and consumable-rod increases, deposit's thickness and width decrease simultaneously. According to conservation of mass, the material transferring & figuration rules in friction surfacing were analyzed, which explains the experimental results as well. So, figuration control methods of deposit in friction surfacing are set up. In practice, process parameters must be chosen properly to ensure good figuration. Only if process parameters are inside the feasible area, material can transfer fluently and deposit with good figuration could be got.

42549145907	Fabrication and microstructure of Fe-based amorphous composite coatings by laser cladding	Fe-based amorphous composite coatings were fabricated on AISI 1045 steel by laser cladding. The results of the X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses show the coating is composed of an amorphous phase in majority and a nanocrystalline phase in minority. Phase composition of the coating changes along the depth of the coating. The reasonable scanning speed for fabricating an amorphous composite coating is 3500 mm/min when the laser power is 4800 W and the laser beam diameter is 2 mm. If the scanning speed is lower than 3500 mm/min, the intensity of the two main diffraction peaks in X-ray diffraction patterns of the coatings decreases with the scanning speeds increasing. At the same time, a broad halo peak emerges and enlarges. High laser power and fast scanning speed are the essential conditions of amorphization. The coating exhibits high microhardness.

The results show that the span between two cores of twin electrode is the important factor for affecting arc voltage. Adjustment of the space between twin electrode and work-piece has a little influence on arc voltage. Increasing the span of two cores makes arc voltage get up. The shape of mantle scope of welding rod changes from both side pointed and midst concave to both side concave and midst convex, and the welding arc changes from small and centralized type into large and decentralized shape. For the twin electrode with a coating weight coefficient of 45.6 per cent and a diameter of 4 mm, good weld appearance can be gained, when the welding current is 200 A and the span of two cores ranges from 1.2 mm to 1.7 mm.

The variation of arc shape caused by changes of the parameters was recorded by a high-speed camera, and the depths of penetration of specimen were measured after bead welding by an optical microscope. Experiments indicated that proper parameters give birth to a concentrated and compressed welding arc, which would increase the depth of penetration as the incensement of the arc force. Several principal parameters including the distance of twin wires intersecting point to base metal, the included angle, and the content of shielding gas were determined. The arc turned more concentrated and the depth of penetration increased obviously as the welding current increased, the arc turned brighter while unobvious change of penetration occurred as the arc voltage increased, and the deepest penetration was obtained when the welding speed was 10.5 mm/s. © 2009 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

The progress of transition is captured by a high speed camera system with a xenon lamp as light source in order to remove the intense arc light. An oscilloscope is used to record the values of the parameters. Results show that anode and cathode have different transfer modes under certain conditions because of different melting rates. All the transfer modes are classified as short-circuiting transfer and free-flight transfer. The latter could be subdivided into globular transfer, projected transfer, streaming transfer, etc. The metal transfer modes of TWIAWare influenced by the welding current, arc voltage and shielding gas. With an increase in welding current and arc voltage, the transition frequency increases and droplets become smaller. Images indicate that the metal transfer modes influence arc shape periodically because of the detaching force and retainable force changing periodically. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2009.

In this paper, the finite element method was employed to simulate the coupling of 3-D temperature field and deformation field of coating rod during friction surfacing. The simulation results show that at the preliminary preheating period, the isotherm goes down at the center part, and the temperature field presents "M" along the radial direction. The temperature increasing rate at the friction interface is higher at first, and then become lower, once the friction system becomes quasi-steady, the temperature here will be stable approximately.

The effects of chromium nitride on microstructure and property of cladding layer were studied. The experimental results indicate the chromium nitride is unstable during the process of laser cladding. It is very difficult to obtain chromium nitride in the laser cladding layer. However, the addition of chromium nitride in cladding powders could promote the formation of austenite phase, and increase the microhardness of cladding layer. The reason about increasing the microhardness of cladding layer is the formation of little carbide and solution strengthening of nitrogen, not the strengthening from chromium nitride. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Structure defects in the HPHT-grown diamonds can be interpreted by moiré fringe images. It was shown by moiré fringe images that there exist stacking faults, stacking-fault tetrahedral, twins and concentric dislocation loops in the HPHT-grown diamonds. Some stacking faults terminating on intersecting twin boundary suggest that the Shockley partial dislocations react with the twins on the (111) pane. The stacking faults, twins and stacking-fault tetrahedral derive from the supersaturated vacancies in the HPHT-grown diamonds. The concentric dislocation loops and fringe distortions in the moiré images may result from the internal stresses associated with the inclusions in the diamonds. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A new design of soft-switching inverter arc welding power is proposed. The soft-switching state of any load, such as unloading, short-circuiting and arcing, can be primarily realized by the design. The paper analyses the relation between the parallel capacities and the shutting loss of the leading-arm, the effect of the serial capacities and the inductance of the loop impact on the change of current during the circumfluence time, the zero-current-shutting extent of the lagging-arm and the ZVS, ZCS condition of the leading-arm devices and lagging-arm devices.

Practice shows that the design reduces the switching stress and loss, improves the reliability of the whole machine and reduces the cost of the arc welding power.

The variation of magnetic induction intensity was measured by Tesla meter, and the metal drop lets transfer was captured by high-speed camera system. The variation of arc voltage and welding current were recorded by oscilloscope synchronously. Results showed that droplets diameter decreased and transition frequency increased with increasing of positive transverse magnetic intensity, while droplets diameter increased and transition frequency decreased with increasing of negative transverse magnetic intensity. The droplets would deflect after falling from wires and the deflection degree increased with increasing longitudinal magnetic intensity. The droplets deflected to cathode when positive longitudinal magnetic field was applied while deflecting to anode when negative longitudinal magnetic field was applied.

80053942864	Investigation on penetration of pulsed twin deposition electrode arc welding	Effects of pulsed parameters on weld penetration with the method of orthogonal experiment were researched when pulse power supply was applied to twin deposition electrode arc welding. Results of orthogonal experiment indicated the change of pulsed parameters could result in the corresponding change of weld penetration, and the descending order of pulsed parameters influencing weld penetration was as follows: peak current > frequency > duty ratio > base current. Greater penetration could be obtained with these pulsed parameters: peak current of 230-240 A, frequency of 3.3-3.7 Hz, duty ratio of 48%-52% and base current of 160-175 A. Optimal combination of pulse parameters of obtaining greater penetration is determined, which is frequency of 3.5 Hz, peak current of 230 A, base current of 160 A and duty ratio of 50%. Weld penetration increases when pulse power supply is applied to twin deposition electrode arc welding.

84755160854	Effects of applied magnetic field on twin-wire indirect arc shapes	Research on regularity of indirect arc shapes change with variation of applied magnetic field is studied. Results show that indirect arc would be elongated or compressed in XOZ plane with variation of applied transverse magnetic field's direction and intensity, while the indirect arc would be deflected with the application of longitude magnetic field in YOZ plane, and the deflection degree and direction will be also changed by the variation of longitude magnetic field's intensity and direction. It is considered that change of arc shapes is caused by variation of arc forces.

84865054115	Relationship between metal transfer and arc shape in twin-wire indirect arc welding	Relationship between metal transfer, arc shape and arc voltage was investigated with high speed camcorder system and digital oscillograph. Results show that metal transfer has a close relationship with arc voltage and the regular variation of arc shape. It shows that the regular changes of metal transfer make polarity spots spacing and arc beam resistance change and cause the arc voltage fluctuations, so that the arc shape changes regularly. Droplet transfer pattern changes and droplet size dereases with the increasing of welding current, different metal transfer mode has different arc voltage fluctuation, spraying transfer has lower variation of voltage but short transfer's arc voltage variation is bigger.

The interface of the hard alloy and the brazing filler alloy is in a good condition. The interface zone consists of WC, TiC, and CuZn (α-phase). There are no micro-cracks, inclusions, etc., near to the brazing interface. The interface zone is formed by the mutual diffusion of elements in the hard alloy and the brazing alloy under the condition of high temperature. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0037465002	Prismatic dislocation loops and concentric dislocation loops in HPHT-grown diamond single crystals	As-grown diamond single crystals grown from Fe-Ni-C system under high temperature-high pressure were examined by transmission electron microscopy. There exist prismatic dislocation loops and concentric dislocation loops in the diamond, which are related to the nonequilibrium nature of the diamond synthesis process. The prismatic dislocation loops may be formed by vacancy condensation during rapid cooling from high temperature, and the Burgers vector of the dislocation is determined by diffraction contrast as 1/2<1 1 0>. Moiré fringes formed by two overlapping (1 1 1) close-packed planes were used to study concentric dislocation loops. The concentric dislocation loops may be derived from thermal stress caused by the inclusions in the diamond, which cause a strain field due to the thermal contraction difference between the inclusions and the diamond during cooling from high temperature. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

84867159715	Microstructure and tribological behavior of laser in situ synthesized TiC-reinforced fe-based composite coatings	Fe-based composite coatings reinforced with TiC particles were prepared by laser surface engineering from precursor of ferrotitanium and graphite. Microstructure of the composite coatings was comprised of dendritic TiC dispersed in a ferrite matrix. In situ dendritic TiC was formed by mechanism of precipitating from the liquid Fe-Ti-C alloy system. Composite coatings showed a substantial increase in microhardness in comparison to that of the substrate. Dry sliding wear tests performed at room temperature revealed that the in situ composite coating possessed a considerably reduced wear volume loss owing to the presence of in situ synthesized TiC. A relatively smooth surface was observed for in situ TiC/Fe composite coating due to its high resistance to ploughing and adhesion, which is caused by the uniformly dispersed TiC reinforcement with high volume fraction. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.

The phase constituents and microstructure of the composite coatings were investigated using X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron micrography. The results indicate that the coatings consist mainly of Fe-Cr fine phases with good resistance to oxidation and corrosion and a few of γ-Fe phases. In-situ synthesized Nb(C, N) particulates are uniformly distributed with blocky morphology in the composite coatings. The wear test shows that these reinforcement particulates improves wear resistance of the coatings significantly. The wear mass loss of the substrate with coating is about one ninth of that of the substrate without coatings. The coatings have better oxidation resistance through 750°C constant temperature oxidation, and the oxide scale mainly consists of NbO

84880013757	Analysis on welding stability of twin deposition surfacing electrode	The influences of the electrode parameters and welding parameters on the welding stability were investigated with φ 4.0 mm twin deposition surfacing electrode. The results show that the arc voltage was mainly determined by the distance between twin cores, but it was also affected by the droplet transfer and arc force. Welding with too small or too large distance between twin cores degraded the welding stability. When the distance between twin cores was 1.0 mm and the arc voltage was kept at around 33 V, the welding process was stable. When the weight coefficient of the coating was 45%-56%, the hardness of the cladding layer was over 6200 MPa, with good protection and sufficient metallurgical reaction in the weld. The appropriate welding current should be controlled between 180-200 A, which was higher in magnitude but narrower in amplitude than that with traditional hard surfacing electrodes under the same specification. When the distance between the electrode and workpiece was 7 mm, excellent bonding between the weld and base metal was obtained with stable welding process.

0344685322	Thermodynamic analysis of a Ag-Cu-Ti active brazing alloy	A Ag-Cu-Ti alloy is one of the most extensive brazing alloy for joining of ceramics to metals with active metal brazing method. The activity of Ti as a alloy element is a key factor influencing the interface reaction between ceramics and the brazing alloy, and plays an important role in wettability and joining ability of ceramics by the brazing alloy. In this paper, the Ag-Cu-Ti brazing alloy has been analyzed thermodynamically, the Ti activity and its relation to the concentration of the alloy components have been studied, and the interaction parameters of the alloy components have calculated. Results of the analysis and calculation have shown that the activity of Ti decreases with increasing Cu and decreasing Ag content. There is a certain repulsive interaction, 32.83 kJ/mol of calculated value, between Ag and Ti, while a strong attractive interaction, -16.14 kJ/mol, between Cu and Ti. In order to improving the activity of Ti, it is helpful to adding some alloy elements to the Ag-Cu-Ti alloy, which has a strong bond with Cu, a weak bond with Ti, and no formation of the high melting point compounds or brittle phases with alloy components.

84890825413	Mathematical simulation of gas shielded twin-tungsten indirect arc	Indirect arc welding is a novelty welding method with advantages of high efficiency, energy saving, low welding stress and deformation. In order to study the arc parameters distribution and the root cause of the low heat input of this novelty welding method, three dimensions finite element model for the indirect arc is established by finite element analysis software. The temperature, velocity and pressure distribution of twin-tungsten indirect arc are obtained. The simulation result is compare with those photos obtained from high-speed camera, and verified the reliability of simulated method. The results show that the twin-tungsten indirect arc deflected to the anode side, the shape of the arc is similarity to inverted bell. The arc parameter of the indirect arc in cathode side is smaller than that of anode side. The parameters of the arc column are much smaller than that of anode surface of TIG welding and plasma arc welding. In the welding process, the work piece doesn't connect electrodes and is mainly heated by the end of the arc column area in where the parameters mentioned above are far smaller than cathode region and anode region is the fundamental reason for low welding heat input and welding penetration.

84899585300	Physical characteristics of twin-wire indirect arc plasma	In this study, the behavior of arc in a twin-wire indirect arc welding is simulated for arc lengths of 5.2 mm, 6.2 mm and 7.2 mm. The plasma temperature is measured by spectrometric method. The results showed that increase in arc length increase the arc parameters (plasma temperature, current density, plasma velocity, heat flux and arc voltage) of twin-wire indirect arc (TWIA). The change in arc length was found to have little influence on the distribution and the variation in trend of arc parameters in the whole arc region. As the arc length increases, the arc parameters in cathode region increase at a slower rate than those of anode region. This probably is the reason for self-adjustment of TWIA and for the arc stability in a certain range of arc lengths. The temperature of anode region is slightly higher than that in the cathode region and other arc parameters have similar trends. The isotherms are displaced toward the anode side and the shape of TWIA is similar to an inclined and inverted bell. The displacement increases with increasing arc length. The experimental results of plasma temperatures are in good agreement with calculated results which verifies the accuracy of the calculated results. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84902835241	Twin-wire indirect arc welding by modeling and experiment	Argon-shielded twin-wire indirect arc (TWIA) welding is a method with a high melting rate, high welding efficiency, low welding deformation and low penetration depth of the weld joint. In this paper, the arc behavior of the twin-wire indirect arc (TWIA) for current values of 100 A, 150 A and 200 A and their influence on the welding process were discussed, and the reasons of the previously mentioned advantages of this welding method were analyzed. The plasma temperature was measured to verify the correctness of the simulation. The results indicate that the arc behavior is mainly controlled by the welding current. With the increasing current, the arc parameters in the anode and cathode regions significantly increase, whereas those in the arc column region vary by a smaller degree. The rate of increase of the arc parameters in the entire arc region is smaller than that of the welding current. The isotherm shifts toward the anode side and the shift of the isotherm increases when the welding current increases. The advantaged of TWIA welding was discussed according to the calculated result. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The influences of hybrid arc welding parameters on welding speed and weld appearance were studied through orthogonal experiment and the microstructures and mechanical properties of weld were tested and compared with that of the conventional MAG weld. The TIG-MAG hybrid arc welding speed could reach up to 3.5 m/min for bead-on-plate welding of 2.5 mm thick mild steel plate under the condition of high quality of weld appearance and 4.5 m/min for butt welding of 2 mm thick mild steel plate, respectively. The mechanical properties of hybrid arc weld were not lower than that of the conventional MAG weld. The assistant TIG arc could effectively stabilize the MAG welding current and MAG arc voltage in high speed TIG-MAG hybrid arc welding process. The stable hybridization obtained by balance between TIG and MAG welding current and proper wire-electrode distance was a key factor to stabilize the welding process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental test indicated that welding crack commonly produced in the partially-melted zone which has 20-60 μm distance to the melting line and propagated in parallel with the fusion zone or turned into the weld metal.

The microstructure, properties and wear mechanism of surface metal were systemically studied. The results show carbides particles are embedded in Fe matrix, Microstructure of which is lath martensite. The carbides mixed in the lath martensite provide a combination of good hardness and toughness. The residual austenite transforms to martensite, which is caused by the press stress, strengthens the matrix and releases the stress. The surface layers have high abrasive resistance and cracking resistance. The integration of dispersedly distributed carbides, lath martensite and residual austenite of the surface layer results in satisfactory wear resistance.

Based on test results, the characteristics and mode of metal transfer of twin electrode single arc welding has been analyzed and summarized. In the twin electrode single arc welding, work-piece does not receive power source, the drop transitional direction and current direction are not the same. Because of the particularity of electric arc heating coating, it is easy to produce the sleeve shape of both sides pointed and midst concave and help to transform with flux wall guided transfer.
