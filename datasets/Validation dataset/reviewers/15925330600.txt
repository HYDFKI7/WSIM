21044457944	The effect of transformation on virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae	Objective: The effect of pneumococcal transformation on its pathogenesis was investigated. Methods: Three transformation-deficient strains No. 1d, 2d and 22d were established by the insertion of inactivating gene comE. The virulence of transformation-deficient strains were compared with the wild ones by challenging mice through intraperitoneal route, by adhering to ECV 304 cells in vitro and by detecting their gene PsaA mRNA expression. Results: In comparison with the wild strains, the adherence rates of all transformation-deficient strains to ECV 304 cell were significantly reduced(P < 0.05), the median survival time of No. 1d and 2d strains significantly increased by challenging mice through intraperitoneal route (P < 0.05), and the mRNA expressions of PsaA were reduced (P < 0.05) in No. 2d and 22d strains. Conclusion: These results indicated that transformation might affect the virulence expression in S. pneumoniae.

24944517399	The effect of transformation on the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae	Although pneumococcus is one of the most frequently encountered opportunistic pathogen in the world, the mechanisms responsible for its infectiveness have not yet been fully understood. In this paper, we have attempted to characterize the effects of pneumococcal transformation on the pathogenesis of the organism. We constructed three transformation-deficient pneumococcal strains, which were designated as Nos. 1d, 2d, and 22d. The construction of these altered strains was achieved via the insertion of the inactivated gene, comE, to strains 1, 2 and 22. We then conducted a comparison between the virulence of the transformation-deficient strains and that of the wild-type strains, via an evaluation of the ability of each strain to adhere to endothelial cells, and also assessed psaA mRNA expression, and the survival of hosts after bacterial challenge. Compared to what was observed with the wild-type strains, our results indicated that the ability of all of the transformation-deficient strains to adhere to the ECV304 cells had been significantly reduced (p < 0.05), the expression of psaA mRNA was reduced significantly (p < 0.05) in strains 2d and 22d, and the median survival time of mice infected with strains 1d and 2d was increased significantly after intraperitoneal bacterial challenge (p < 0.05). The results of our study also clearly indicated that transformation exerts significant effects on the virulence characteristics of S. pneumoniae, although the degree to which this effect is noted appears to depend primarily on the genetic background of the bacteria.

33846452993	Real-time quantitative assay of HCV RNA using the duplex scorpion primer	A novel real-time quantitative method for detecting HCV in serum was established in which the duplex scorpion primer was used to provide a unimolecular probing mechanism for hybridizing the highly conserved 5′ noncoding region (5′ NCR) of the HCV genome specifically. Through methodological evaluation, we found this new method had a wide linearity, high sensitivity, repeatability and specificity. Compared to the commercial TaqMan method, this method was found to be more sensitive and less costly, and the final results were obtained more quickly. Therefore, it could be applied to diagnose and monitor HCV infection in clinical practice. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

33847199795	Wnt signaling and human diseases: What are the therapeutic implications?	Wnt signaling plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. De-regulation of these signaling pathways has been implicated in many human diseases, ranging from cancers to skeletal disorders. Wnt proteins are a large family of secreted factors that bind to the Frizzled receptors and LRP5/6 co-receptors and initiate complex signaling cascades. Over the past two decades, our understanding of Wnt signaling has been significantly improved due to the identification of many key regulators and mediators of these pathways. Given that Wnt signaling is tightly regulated at multiple cellular levels, these pathways themselves offer ample nodal points for targeted therapeutics. Here, we focus on our current understanding of these pathways, the associations of Wnt signaling with human disorders, and the opportunities to target key components of Wnt signaling for rational drug discovery. © 2007 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

34248355601	Distinct roles of bone morphogenetic proteins in osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Efficacious bone regeneration could revolutionize the clinical management of many bone and musculoskeletal disorders. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) can regulate the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into cartilage, bone, tendon/ligament, and fat lineages. Early data documented the osteogenic potential of rhBMP2 and rhBMP7/OP-1. However, prior to this work that summarized several of our recent studies, no comprehensive analysis had been undertaken to characterize relative osteogenic activity of all BMPs. Using recombinant adenoviruses expressing 14 BMPs, we have demonstrated that, besides BMP2 and BMP7, BMP6 and BMP9 exhibit the highest osteogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrated that several BMPs may exert synergistic effect on osteogenic differentiation, and that osteogenic BMPs produce a distinct set of molecular fingerprints during osteogenic differentiation. The reported work should expand our current understanding of BMP functions during osteogenic differentiation. It is conceivable that osteogenic BMPs (i.e., BMP2, 4, 6, 7, and 9) may be used to formulate synergistic pairs among themselves and/or with other less osteogenic BMPs for efficacious bone regeneration in clinical settings. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

34250378403	A protocol for rapid generation of recombinant adenoviruses using the AdEasy system	Recombinant adenoviruses provide a versatile system for gene expression studies and therapeutic applications. We have developed an approach that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses called the AdEasy system. A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, employing homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfection of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of GFP encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. This system has expedited the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses for a variety of purposes. In this protocol, we describe the practical aspects of using the AdEasy system for generating recombinant adenoviruses. The full protocol usually takes 4-5 weeks to complete.

38449093315	Regulation of osteogenic differentiation during skeletal development	Bone formation during skeletal development involves a complex coordination among multiple cell types and tissues. Bone is of crucial importance for the human body, providing skeletal support, and serving as a home for the formation of hematopoietic cells and as a reservoir for calcium and phosphate. Bone is also continuously remodeled in vertebrates throughout life. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts are specialized cells responsible for bone formation and resorption, respectively. Early development of the vertebrate skeleton depends on genes that control the distribution and proliferation of cells from cranial neural crest, sclerotomes, and lateral plate mesoderm into mesenchymal condensations, where cells differentiate to osteoblasts. Significant progress has been made over the past decade in our understanding of the molecular framework that controls osteogenic differentiation. A large number of morphogens, signaling molecules, and transcriptional regulators have been implicated in regulating bone development. A partial list of these factors includes the Wnt/β-catenin, TGFβ/BMP, FGF, Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways, and Runx2, Osterix, ATF4, TAZ, and NFATc1 transcriptional factors. A better understanding of molecular mechanisms behind osteogenic differentiation would not only help us to identify pathogenic causes of bone and skeletal diseases but also lead to the development of targeted therapies for these diseases.

34247559616	Selection and validation of optimal siRNA target sites for RNAi-mediated gene silencing	RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing has become a valuable tool for functional studies, reverse genomics, and drug discoveries. One major challenge of using RNAi is to identify the most effective short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) sites of a given gene. Although several published bioinformatic prediction models have proven useful, the process to select and validate optimal siRNA sites for a given gene remains empirical and laborious. Here, we developed a fluorescence-based selection system using a retroviral vector backbone, namely pSOS, which was based on the premise that candidate siRNAs would knockdown the chimeric transcript between GFP and target gene. The expression of siRNA was driven by the opposing convergent H1 and U6 promoters. This configuration simplifies the cloning of duplex siRNA oligonucleotide cassettes. We demonstrated that GFP signal reduction was closely correlated with siRNA knockdown efficiency of human β-catenin, as well as with the inhibition of β-catenin/Tcf4 signaling activity. The pSOS should not only facilitate the selection and validation of candidate siRNA sites, but also provide efficient delivery tools of siRNAs via viral vectors in mammalian cells. Thus, the pSOS system represents an efficient and user-friendly strategy to select and validate siRNA target sites. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79951859266	Identification and analysis of typeii TGFβ receptors in BMP9 induced osteogenesis	In the previous reports, BMP9 has shown potent function to induce osteogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanism of osteogenesis induced by BMP9 is needed to be deeply explored. Dominant negative type II TGFβ receptors and BMP9 were constructed by following recombinant adenoviruses protocol and co-introduced into target cells. Then the type II TGFβ receptors required for BMP9-induced osteogenesis was identified and analyzed through in vitro and in vivo assays. It was found that three dominant negative type II TGFβ receptors, which are dnBMPR II, dnActR II and dnActR II B, can not only reduce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity induced by BMP9 and calcium deposition, but also repress the activation of Smad signal pathway. Moreover, dnBMPR II, dnActR II and dnActR II B also showed to inhibit ectopic bone formation induced by BMP9 in vivo. However, target cells expressed BMPR II and ActR II, but not ActR II B. Then, when BMPR II and ActR II were silenced by RNA interference in target cells, luciferase reporter activity and ALP activity induced by BMP9 was accordingly inhibited along with knockdown of BMPR II and ActR IIII. Taken together, those results intensively suggest that BMPR II and ActR II are the functional type II TGFβ receptors required for BMP9 induced osteogenesis.

84861818931	Smads, p38 and ERK1/2 are involved in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells	Although previous studies have demonstrated that BMP9 is highly capable of inducing osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, the molecular mechanism involved remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we showed that BMP9 simul taneously promotes the activation of Smad1/5/8, p38 and ERK1/2 in C3H10T1/2 cells. Knockdown of Smad4 with RNA interference reduced nuclear translocation of Smad1/5/8, and disrupted BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation was blocked by p38 inhibitor SB203580, whereas enhanced by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. SB203580 decreased BMP9-activated Smads singling, and yet PD98059 stimulated Smads singling in C3H10T1/2 cells. The effects of inhibitor were reproduced with adenovirus expressing siRNA targeted p38 and ERK1/2, respectively. Taken together, our findings revealed that Smads, p38 and ERK1/2 are involved in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Also, it is noteworthy that p38 and ERK1/2 may play opposing regulatory roles in mediating BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells.

84887619842	Exomic analysis of myxoid liposarcomas, synovial sarcomas, and osteosarcomas	Bone and soft tissue sarcomas are a group of histologically heterogeneous and relatively uncommon tumors. To explore their genetic origins, we sequenced the exomes of 13 osteosarcomas, eight myxoid liposarcomas (MLPS), and seven synovial sarcomas (SYN). These tumors had few genetic alterations (median of 10.8). Nevertheless, clear examples of driver gene mutations were observed, including canonical mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, SETD2, AKT1, and subclonal mutation in FBXW7. Of particular interest were mutations in H3F3A, encoding the variant histone H3.3. Mutations in this gene have only been previously observed in gliomas. Loss of heterozygosity of exomic regions was extensive in osteosarcomas but rare in SYN and MLPS. These results provide intriguing nucleotide-level information on these relatively uncommon neoplasms and highlight pathways that help explain their pathogenesis.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

45849092251	Characterization of gene expression regulated by American ginseng and ginsenoside Rg3 in human colorectal cancer cells	American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L., Araliaceae) possesses anti-cancer potential and is one of the most commonly used herbal medicines in the United States. Ginsenoside Rg3, one of the saponins in American ginseng, has been shown to inhibit tumor growth. In this study, we sought to characterize the downstream genes targeted by American ginseng extracts in HCT-116 human colorectal cancer cells. We first demonstrated that the content of Rg3 in American ginseng steamed at 120°C for 2 h (referred to as S2h) was significantly increased when compared with that of the unsteamed ginseng. Both S2h and Rg3 exhibited anti-proliferative effects on HCT-116 cells. Using the Affymetrix high density genechips containing more than 40,000 genes and ESTs, the gene expression profiling of HCT-116 cells were assayed. Microarray data indicated that the expression levels of 76 genes were changed significantly after treatment with S2h or Rg3, whereby it was found that 52 of the 76 genes were up-regulated while the remaining 24 were down-regulated. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of top functions affected by both S2h and Rg3 were carried out. The most effected pathway is the Ephrin receptor pathway. To validate the microarray data, quantitative real-time PCR of six candidate target genes was conducted, whereby it was found that three genes were up-regulated (AKAPA8L, PMPCB and PDE5A) and three were down-regulated (PITPNA, DUS2L and RIC8A). Although further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action, our findings should expand the understanding of the molecular framework of American ginseng as an anti-cancer agent.

50649112829	Osteosarcoma development and stem cell differentiation	Osteosarcoma is the most common nonhematologic malignancy of bone in children and adults. The peak incidence occurs in the second decade of life, with a smaller peak after age 50. Osteosarcoma typically arises around the growth plate of long bones. Most osteosarcoma tumors are of high grade and tend to develop pulmonary metastases. Despite clinical improvements, patients with metastatic or recurrent diseases have a poor prognosis. Here, we reviewed the current understanding of human osteosarcoma, with an emphasis on potential links between defective osteogenic differentiation and bone tumorigenesis. Existing data indicate osteosarcoma tumors display a broad range of genetic and molecular alterations, including the gains, losses, or arrangements of chromosomal regions, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and the deregulation of major signaling pathways. However, except for p53 and/or RB mutations, most alterations are not constantly detected in the majority of osteosarcoma tumors. With a rapid expansion of our knowledge about stem cell biology, emerging evidence suggests osteosarcoma should be regarded as a differentiation disease caused by genetic and epigenetic changes that interrupt osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells. Understanding the molecular pathogenesis of human osteosarcoma could ultimately lead to the development of diagnostic and prognostic markers, as well as targeted therapeutics for osteosarcoma patients. © 2008 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons.

56649094497	Osteogenic BMPs promote tumor growth of human osteosarcomas that harbor differentiation defects	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of bone. Here, we investigated a possible role of defective osteoblast differentiation in OS tumorigenesis. We found that basal levels of the early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were low in OS lines. Osteogenic regulators Runx2 and OSX, and the late marker osteopontin (OPN) expressed at low levels in most OS lines, indicating that most OS cells fail to undergo terminal differentiation. Furthermore, OS cells were refractory to osteogenic BMP-induced increases in ALP activity. Osteogenic BMPs were shown to upregulate early target genes, but not late osteogenic markers OPN and osteocalcin (OC). Furthermore, osteogenic BMPs failed to induce bone formation from human OS cells, rather effectively promoted OS tumor growth in an orthotopic OS model. Exogenous expression of early target genes enhanced BMP-stimulated OS tumor growth, whereas osteogenic BMP-promoted OS tumor growth was inhibited by exogenous Runx2 expression. These results suggest that alterations in osteoprogenitors may disrupt osteogenic differentiation pathway. Thus, identifying potential differentiation defects in OS tumors would allow us to reconstruct the tumorigenic events in osteoprogenitors and to develop rational differentiation therapies for clinical OS management. © 2008 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

58649085508	Hey1 basic helix-loop-helix protein plays an important role in mediating BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are bone marrow stromal progenitor cells that can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages. We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 9 is one of the most potent and yet least characterized BMPs that are able to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we conducted gene expression-profiling analysis and identified that Hey1 of the hairy/Enhancer of split-related repressor protein basic helix-loop-helix family was among the most significantly up-regulated early targets in BMP9-stimulated MSCs. We demonstrated that Heyl expression was up-regulated at the immediate early stage of BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that Hey1 may be a direct target of the BMP9-induced Smad signaling pathway. Silencing Heyl expression diminished BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo and led to chondrogenic differentiation. Likewise, constitutive Hey1 expression augmented BMP9-me-diated bone matrix mineralization. Hey1 and Runx2 were shown to act synergistically in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation, and Runx2 expression significantly decreased in the absence of Hey1, suggesting that Runx2 may function downstream of Hey1. Accordingly, the defective osteogenic differentiation caused by Hey1 knockdown was rescued by exogenous Runx2 expression. Thus, our findings suggest that Heyl, through its interplay with Runx2, may play an important role in regulating BMP9-induced osteoblast lineage differentiation of MSCs. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biololgy, Inc.

61849117441	Caseinolytic protease: A protein vaccine which could elicit serotype-independent protection against invasive pneumococcal infection	Invasive pneumococcal diseases incur significant mortality, morbidity and economic costs. The most effective strategy currently available to reduce the burden of these diseases is vaccination. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of immunizing mice with caseinolytic protease (ClpP) protein antigen whose gene sequences were shown to be highly conserved in different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae in an invasive-disease model (intraperitoneal infection model), and protection against invasive challenge with 12 different serotypes of S. pneumoniae was assessed in two murine strains. Our findings demonstrated that active immunization with ClpP and passive immunization with antibodies specific for ClpP could elicit serotype-independent protection effectively against invasive pneumococcal infection. Therefore, to our knowledge, this study is the first report that immunization with single pneumococcal ClpP protein antigen could protect against such broad-range pneumococal strains, which thus supports the development of ClpP as a human penumococcal vaccine. © 2009 British Society for Immunology.

67649271549	A Comprehensive analysis of the dual roles of BMPs in regulating adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are bone marrow stromal progenitor cells that can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages. Several signaling pathways have been shown to regulate the lineage commitment and terminal differentiation of MSCs. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the 14 types of bone morphogenetic protein (BMPs) for their abilities to regulate multilineage specific differentiation of MSCs. We found that most BMPs exhibited distinct abilities to regulate the expression of Runx2, Sox9, MyoD, and PPAR2. Further analysis indicated that BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, BMP-7, and BMP-9 effectively induced both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. BMP-induced commitment to osteogenic or adipogenic lineage was shown to be mutually exclusive. Overexpression of Runx2 enhanced BMP-induced osteogenic differentiation, whereas knockdown of Runx2 expression diminished BMP-induced bone formation with a decrease in adipocyte accumulation in vivo. Interestingly, overexpression of PPAR2 not only promoted adipogenic differentiation, but also enhanced osteogenic differentiation upon BMP-2, BMP-6, and BMP-9 stimulation. Conversely, MSCs with PPAR2 knockdown or mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from PPAR2

69249098540	Wnt antagonist SFRP3 inhibits the differentiation of mouse hepatic progenitor cells	Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays an important role in regulating embryonic development. Hepatocytes differentiate from endoderm during development. Hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) have been isolated from fetal liver and extrahepatic tissues. Most current studies in liver development and hepatic differentiation have been focused on Wnts, β-catenin, and their receptors. Here, we sought to determine the role of Wnt antagonists in regulating hepatic differentiation of fetal liver-derived HPCs. Using mouse liver tissues derived from embryonic day E12.5 to postnatal day (PD) 28, we found that 13 of the 19 Wnt genes and almost all of Wnt receptors/co-receptors were expressed in most stages. However, Wnt antagonists SFRP2, SFRP3, and Dkk2 were only detected in the early stages. We established and characterized the reversible stable HPCs derived from E14.5 mouse fetal liver (HP14.5). HP14.5 cells were shown to express high levels of early liver progenitor cell markers, but low levels or none of late liver markers. HP14.5 cells were shown to differentiate into mature hepatocytes upon dexamethasone (Dex) stimulation. Dex-induced late marker expression and albumin promoter activity in HP14.5 cells were inhibited by exogenous expression of SFRP3. Furthermore, Dex-induced glycogen synthesis of PAS-positive HP14.5 cells was significantly inhibited by SFRP3. Therefore, our results have demonstrated that the expression of Wnt antagonists decreases as hepatic differentiation progresses, suggesting that a balanced Wnt signaling may be critical during mouse liver development and hepatic differentiation. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

70350225306	Activation of RXR and RAR signaling promotes myogenic differentiation of myoblastic C2C12 cells	Differentiation of embryonic and adult myogenic progenitors undergoes a complex series of cell rearrangements and specification events which are controlled by distinct gene regulatory networks. Delineation of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle specification and formation should be important for understanding congenital myopathies and muscular degenerative diseases. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling plays an important role in development. However, the role of RA signaling in adult myogenic progenitors is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of RA signaling in regulating myogenic differentiation of myoblastic progenitor cells. Using the mouse myoblast progenitor C2C12 line as a model, we have found that the endogenous expression of most RAR and RXR isotypes is readily detected. While the nuclear receptor co-repressors are highly expressed, two of the three nuclear receptor co-activators and the enzymes involved in RA synthesis are expressed at low level or undetectable, suggesting that the RA signaling pathway may be repressed in myogenic progenitors. Using the α-myosin heavy chain promoter-driven reporter (MyHC-GLuc), we have demonstrated that either ATRA or 9CRA is able to effectively induce myogenic differentiation, which can be synergistically enhanced when both ATRA and 9CRA are used. Upon ATRA and 9CRA treatment of C2C12 cells the expression of late myogenic markers significantly increases. We have further shown that adenovirus-mediated exogenous expression of RARα and/or RXRα is able to effectively induce myogenic differentiation in a ligand-independent fashion. Morphologically, ATRA- and 9CRA-treated C2C12 cells exhibit elongated cell body and become multi-nucleated myoblasts, and even form myoblast fusion. Ultrastructural analysis under transmission electron microscope reveals that RA-treated myogenic progenitor cells exhibit an abundant presence of muscle fibers. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that RA signaling may play an important role in regulating myogenic differentiation. © 2009 International Society of Differentiation.

72949110602	BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors requires functional canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling	Bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP-9) is a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/BMP superfamily, and we have demonstrated that it is one of the most potent BMPs to induce osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Here, we sought to investigate if canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling plays an important role in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Wnt3A and BMP-9 enhanced each other's ability to induce alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in MSCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Wnt antagonist FrzB was shown to inhibit BMP-9-induced ALP activity more effectively than Dkk1, whereas a secreted form of LPR-5 or low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-6 exerted no inhibitory effect on BMP-9-induced ALP activity. β-Catenin knockdown in MSCs and MEFs diminished BMP-9-induced ALP activity, and led to a decrease in BMP-9-induced osteocalcin reporter activity and BMP-9-induced expression of late osteogenic markers. Furthermore, β-catenin knockdown or FrzB overexpression inhibited BMP-9-induced mineralization in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo, resulting in immature osteogenesis and the formation of chondrogenic matrix. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis indicated that BMP-9 induced recruitment of both Runx2 and β-catenin to the osteocalcin promoter. Thus, we have demonstrated that canonical Wnt signalling, possibly through interactions between β-catenin and Runx2, plays an important role in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

71849102165	Establishment and characterization of a new highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell line	Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone in children and young adults. There is a paucity of tumorigenic and highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell lines that have not been further transformed by exogenous means. Here we establish and characterize a highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell line that is derived from a poorly metastatic MG63 line through serial passage in nude mice via intratibial injections. The occasional pulmonary metastases developed from MG63 were harvested and repassaged in mice until a highly metastatic subline (MG63.2) was established. The parental MG63 and highly metastatic MG63.2 cells were further characterized in vitro and in vivo. MG63.2 cells demonstrated increased cell migration and invasion compared to the parental MG63 cells. Conversely, cell adhesion was significantly greater in MG63 cells when compared to the MG63.2 cells. MG63.2 cells grew at a slightly slower rate than that of the parental cells. When injected into nude mice, MG63.2 cells had a greater than 200-fold increase in developing pulmonary metastases compared to the parental MG63 cells. MG63.2 cells also formed larger primary tumors when compared to the parental MG63 cells. Further analysis revealed that ezrin expression was up-regulated in the metastatic MG63.2 cells. Interestingly, expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were down-regulated, and expression of TIMP-2 was up-regulated in the MG63.2 cells. Taken together, we have established and characterized a highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell line that should serve as a valuable tool for future investigations on the pathogenesis, metastasis, and potential treatments of human osteosarcoma. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77951021015	Synergistic antitumor effect of the activated PPARγ and retinoid receptors on human osteosarcoma	Purpose: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone. The long-term survival of osteosarcoma patients hinges on our ability to prevent and/or treat recurrent and metastatic lesions. Here, we investigated the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and retinoid receptors as a means of differentiation therapy for human osteosarcoma. Experimental Design: We examined the endogenous expression of PPARγ and retinoid receptors in a panel of osteosarcoma cells. Ligands or adenovirus-mediated overexpression of these receptors were tested to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Osteosarcoma cells overexpressing the receptors were introduced into an orthotopic tumor model. The effect of these ligands on osteoblastic differentiation was further investigated. Results: Endogenous expression of PPARγ and isotypes of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) is detected in most osteosarcoma cells. Troglitazone, 9-cis retinoic acid (RA), and all-trans RA, as well as overexpression of PPARγ, RARα, and RXRα, inhibit osteosarcoma cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. A synergistic inhibitory effect on osteosarcoma cell proliferation is observed between troglitazone and retinoids, as well as with the overexpression pairs of PPARγ/RARα, or PPARγ/RXRα. Overexpression of PPARγ, RARα, RXRα, or in combinations inhibits osteosarcoma tumor growth and cell proliferation in vivo. Retinoids (and to a lesser extent, troglitazone) are shown to promote osteogenic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Conclusions: Activation of PPARγ, RARα, and RXRα may act synergistically on inhibiting osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumor growth, which is at least partially mediated by promoting osteoblastic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells. ©2010 AACR.

77953403597	The CCN proteins: Important signaling mediators in stem cell differentiation and tumorigenesis	The CCN proteins contain six members, namely CCN1 to CCN6, which are small secreted cysteine-rich proteins. The CCN proteins are modular proteins, containing up to four functional domains. Many of the CCN members are induced by growth factors, cytokines, or cellular stress. The CCNs show a wide and highly variable expression pattern in adult and in embryonic tissues. The CCN proteins can integrate and modulate the signals of integrins, BMPs, VEGF, Wnts, and Notch. The involvement of integrins in mediating CCN signaling may provide diverse contextdependent responses in distinct cell types. CCN1 and CCN2 play an important role in development, angiogenesis and cell adhesion, whereas CCN3 is critical to skeletal and cardiac development. CCN4, CCN5 and CCN6 usually inhibit cell growth. Mutations of Ccn6 are associated with the progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda. In stem cell differentiation, CCN1, CCN2, and CCN3 play a principal role in osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and angiogenesis. Elevated expression of CCN1 is associated with more aggressive phenotypes of human cancer, while the roles of CCN2 and CCN3 in tumorigenesis are tumor type-dependent. CCN4, CCN5 and CCN6 function as tumor suppressors. Although CCN proteins may play important roles in fine-tuning other major signaling pathways, the precise function and mechanism of action of these proteins remain undefined. Understanding of the biological functions of the CCN proteins would not only provide insight into their roles in numerous cellular processes but also offer opportunities for developing therapeutics by targeting CCN functions.

77955626799	Retinoic acids potentiate BMP9-lnduced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Background: As one of the least studied bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), BMP9 is one of the most osteogenic BMPs. Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is known to play an important role in development, differentiation and bone metabolism. In this study, we investigate the effect of RA signaling on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). Methodology/Principal Findings: Both primary MPCs and MPC line are used for BMP9 and RA stimulation. Recombinant adenoviruses are used to deliver BMP9, RARa and RXRa into MPCs. The in vitro osteogenic differentiation is monitored by determining the early and late osteogenic markers and matrix mineralization. Mouse perinatal limb explants and in vivo MPC implantation experiments are carried out to assess bone formation. We find that both 9CRA and ATRA effectively induce early osteogenic marker, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and late osteogenic markers, such as osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OC). BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation and mineralization is synergistically enhanced by 9CRA and ATRA in vitro. 9CRA and ATRA are shown to induce BMP9 expression and activate BMPR Smad-mediated transcription activity. Using mouse perinatal limb explants, we find that BMP9 and RAs act together to promote the expansion of hypertrophic chondrocyte zone at growth plate. Progenitor cell implantation studies reveal that co-expression of BMP9 and RXRa or RARa significantly increases trabecular bone and osteoid matrix formation. Conclusion/Significance: Our results strongly suggest that retinoid signaling may synergize with BMP9 activity in promoting osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. This knowledge should expand our understanding about how BMP9 crosstalks with other signaling pathways. Furthermore, a combination of BMP9 and retinoic acid (or its agonists) may be explored as effective bone regeneration therapeutics to treat large segmental bony defects, non-union fracture, and/or osteoporotic fracture. © 2010 Zhang et al.

77956516276	TGFβ/BMP type I receptors ALK1 and ALK2 are essential for BMP9-induced osteogenic signaling in mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are bone marrow stromal cells that can differentiate into multiple lineages. We previously demonstrated that BMP9 is one of the most potent BMPs to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. BMP9 is one of the least studied BMPs. Whereas ALK1, ALK5, and/or endoglin have recently been reported as potential BMP9 type I receptors in endothelial cells, little is known about type I receptor involvement in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the functional role of seven type I receptors in BMP9-induced osteogenic signaling in MSCs. We have found that most of the seven type I receptors are expressed in MSCs. However, using dominant-negative mutants for the seven type I receptors, we demonstrate that only ALK1 and ALK2 mutants effectively inhibit BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro and ectopic ossification in MSC implantation assays. Protein fragment complementation assays demonstrate that ALK1 and ALK2 directly interact with BMP9. Likewise, RNAi silencing of ALK1 and ALK2 expression inhibits BMP9-induced BMPR-Smad activity and osteogenic differentiation in MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that ALK1 and ALK2 may play an important role in mediating BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. These findings should further aid us in understanding the molecular mechanism through which BMP9 regulates osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

77957306392	Identification and analysis of type II TGF- receptors in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells	Our previous studies have demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP-9) is one of the most efficacious BMPs to induce osteoblast differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, dominant negative (DN) type II TGF-β receptors were constructed and introduced into C3H10T1/2 stem cells, then in vitro and in vivo assays were carried out to analyze and identify the type II TGF-β receptors required for BMP-9-induced osteogenesis. We found that three DN type II TGF-β receptors, DN-BMPRII, DN-ActRII, and DN-ActRIIB, diminished BMP-9-induced alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, led to a decrease in BMP-9-induced Smad binding element (SBE)-controled reporter activity, reduced BMP-9-induced expressions of Smad6 and Smad7, and decreased BMP-9-induced mineralization in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo, finally resulted in decreased bone masses and immature osteogenesis. These findings strongly suggested that three wild-type II TGF-β receptors, BMPRII, ActRII and ActRIIB, may play a functional role in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. However, C3H10T1/2 stem cells can express BMPRII and ActRII, but not ActRIIB. Using RNA interference (RNAi), we found that luciferase reporter activity and ALP activity induced by BMP-9 were accordingly inhibited along with the knockdown of BMPRII and ActRII. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BMPRII and ActRII are the functional type II TGF-β receptors in BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. © 2010 The Author.

78349263031	Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) potentiates BMP-9-induced osteogenic differentiation and bone formation	Efficient osteogenic differentiation and bone formation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) should have clinical applications in treating nonunion fracture healing. MSCs are adherent bone marrow stromal cells that can self-renew and differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, and myogenic lineages. We have identified bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP-9) as one of the most osteogenic BMPs. Here we investigate the effect of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) on BMP-9-induced bone formation. We have found that endogenous IGF-2 expression is low in MSCs. Expression of IGF-2 can potentiate BMP-9-induced early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and the expression of later markers. IGF-2 has been shown to augment BMP-9-induced ectopic bone formation in the stem cell implantation assay. In perinatal limb explant culture assay, IGF-2 enhances BMP-9-induced endochondral ossification, whereas IGF-2 itself can promote the expansion of the hypertropic chondrocyte zone of the cultured limb explants. Expression of the IGF antagonists IGFBP3 and IGFBP4 leads to inhibition of the IGF-2 effect on BMP-9-induced ALP activity and matrix mineralization. Mechanistically, IGF-2 is further shown to enhance the BMP-9-induced BMPR-Smad reporter activity and Smad1/5/8 nuclear translocation. PI3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 abolishes the IGF-2 potentiation effect on BMP-9-mediated osteogenic signaling and can directly inhibit BMP-9 activity. These results demonstrate that BMP-9 crosstalks with IGF-2 through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway during osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Taken together, our findings suggest that a combination of BMP-9 and IGF-2 may be explored as an effective bone-regeneration agent to treat large segmental bony defects, nonunion fracture, and/or osteoporotic fracture. ©2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

78649935962	Lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase β (LPAATβ) promotes the tumor growth of human osteosarcoma	Background: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of bone with poorly characterized molecular pathways important in its pathogenesis. Increasing evidence indicates that elevated lipid biosynthesis is a characteristic feature of cancer. We sought to investigate the role of lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase b (LPAATβ, aka, AGPAT2) in regulating the proliferation and growth of human osteosarcoma cells. LPAATβ can generate phosphatidic acid, which plays a key role in lipid biosynthesis as well as in cell proliferation and survival. Although elevated expression of LPAATβ has been reported in several types of human tumors, the role of LPAATβ in osteosarcoma progression has yet to be elucidated. Methodology/Principal Findings: Endogenous expression of LPAATβ in osteosarcoma cell lines is analyzed by using semiquantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of LPAATβ and silencing LPAATβ expression is employed to determine the effect of LPAATβ on osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and osteosarcoma tumor growth in vivo. We have found that expression of LPAATβ is readily detected in 8 of the 10 analyzed human osteosarcoma lines. Exogenous expression of LPAATβ promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration, while silencing LPAATβ expression inhibits these cellular characteristics. We further demonstrate that exogenous expression of LPAATβ effectively promotes tumor growth, while knockdown of LPAATβ expression inhibits tumor growth in an orthotopic xenograft model of human osteosarcoma. Conclusions/Significance: Our results strongly suggest that LPAATβ expression may be associated with the aggressive phenotypes of human osteosarcoma and that LPAATβ may play an important role in regulating osteosarcoma cell proliferation and tumor growth. Thus, targeting LPAATβ may be exploited as a novel therapeutic strategy for the clinical management of osteosarcoma. This is especially attractive given the availability of selective pharmacological inhibitors.© 2010 Rastegar et al.

78650881464	The therapeutic potential of the wnt signaling pathway in bone disorders	The Wnt pathway plays a critical role in development and differentiation of many tissues, such as the gut, hair follicles, and bone. Increasing evidence indicates that Wnts may function as key regulators in osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and bone formation. Conversely, aberrant Wnt signaling is associated with many osteogenic pathologies. For example, genetic alterations in the Wnt signaling pathway lead to osteoporosis and osteopenia, while inactivating mutations of Wnt inhibitors result in a hyperostotic skeleton with increased bone mineral density. Hyperparathyroidism causes osteopenia via induction of the Wnt signaling pathway. Lithium, often used to treat bipolar disorder, blocks a Wnt antagonist, decreasing the patient's risk of fractures. Thus, manipulating the Wnt pathway may offer plenty therapeutic opportunities in treating bone disorders. In fact, induction of the Wnt signaling pathway or inhibition of Wnt antagonists has shown promise in treating bone metabolic disorders, including osteoporosis. For example, antibodies targeting the Wnt inhibitor Sclerostin lead to increased bone mineral density in post-menopausal women. However, such therapies targeting the Wnt pathway are not without risk, as genetic alternations may lead to over-activation of Wnt/ - catenin and its association with many tumors. It is conceivable that targeting Wnt inhibitors may predispose the individuals to tumorigenic phenotypes, at least in bone. Here, we review the roles of Wnt signaling in bone metabolic and pathologic processes, as well as the therapeutic potential for targeting Wnt pathway and its associated risks in bone diseases. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

78651246162	Ginsenoside Rg3 inhibits colorectal tumor growth through the down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadly malignancies in the world. Most CRCs are initiated by aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Despite the advances in its early diagnosis, optimized surgical approaches, and chemotherapies, the clinical management of advanced CRC requires effective adjuvant agents. Ginsenoside Rg3 is a single compound isolated from American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L., Araliaceae) and Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer). We investigated the anticancer activity of Rg3 on colon cancer cells and its potential molecular mechanism behind Rg3's anticancer activity. We found that Rg3 inhibits cell proliferation and viability of cancer cells in vitro. This inhibitory effect of Rg3 is, at least in part, mediated by blocking nuclear translocation of the β-catenin protein and hence inhibiting β-catenin/Tcf transcriptional activity. Allelic deletion of the oncogenic β-catenin in HCT116 cells renders the cells more sensitive to Rg3-induced growth inhibition. Using the xenograft tumor model of human colon cancer, we have demonstrated that Rg3 effectively inhibits the growth of tumors derived from the human colon cancer cell line HCT116. Histologic examination revealed that Rg3 inhibits cancer cell proliferation, decreases PNCA expression and diminishes nuclear staining intensity of β-catenin. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the anticancer activity of Rg3 may be in part caused by blocking the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in colon cancer cells. This line of investigation may lead to the development of novel therapies in which Rg3 can be used as an effective adjuvant agent for the clinical management of colorectal cancers.

78751559362	Tetrandrine inhibits Wnt/β-catenin signaling and suppresses tumor growth of human colorectal cancer	As one of the most common malignancies, colon cancer is initiated by abnormal activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Although the treatment options have increased for some patients, overall progress has been modest. Thus, there is a great need to develop new treatments. We have found that bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid tetrandrine (TET) exhibits anticancer activity. TET is used as a calcium channel blocker to treat hypertensive and arrhythmic conditions in Chinese medicine. Here, we investigate the molecular basis underlying TET's anticancer activity. We compare TET with six chemotherapy drugs in eight cancer lines and find that TET exhibits comparable anticancer activities with camptothecin, vincristine, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin, and better than that of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and carboplatin.

79955082926	Defective osteogenic differentiation in the development of osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma (OS) is associated with poor prognosis due to its high incidence of metastasis and chemoresistance. It often arises in areas of rapid bone growth in long bones during the adolescent growth spurt. Although certain genetic conditions and alterations increase the risk of developing OS, the molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recently, defects in differentiation have been linked to cancers, as they are associated with high cell proliferation. Treatments overcoming these defects enable terminal differentiation and subsequent tumor inhibition. OS development may be associated with defects in osteogenic differentiation. While early regulators of osteogenesis are unable to bypass these defects, late osteogenic regulators, including Runx2 and Osterix, are able to overcome some of the defects and inhibit tumor propagation through promoting osteogenic differentiation. Further understanding of the relationship between defects in osteogenic differentiation and tumor development holds tremendous potential in treating OS. Copyright © 2011 Eric R. Wagner et al.

79955099600	Therapeutic implications of PPARγ in human osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common nonhematologic malignancy of bone in children and adults. Although dysregulation of tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, such as Rb, p53, and the genes critical to cell cycle control, genetic stability, and apoptosis have been identified in OS, consensus genetic changes that lead to OS development are poorly understood. Disruption of the osteogenic differentiation pathway may be at least in part responsible for OS tumorigenesis. Current OS management involves chemotherapy and surgery. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and/or retinoids can inhibit OS proliferation and induce apoptosis and may inhibit OS growth by promoting osteoblastic terminal differentiation. Thus, safe and effective PPAR agonists and/or retinoid derivatives can be then used as adjuvant therapeutic drugs for OS therapy. Furthermore, these agents have the potential to be used as chemopreventive agents for the OS patients who undergo the resection of the primary bone tumors in order to prevent local recurrence and/or distal pulmonary metastasis.

79957453265	Effects of bone morphogenetic protein 9 on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells	Objective: To investigate the effects of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) on the proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: MD-AMB-231 cells were infected with pAdtrack-CMV/BMP9 or pAdtrack-CMV/GFP adenovirus. The expression levels of BMP9 mRNA in MDA-MB-231/GFP and MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells were detected by RT-PCR. The proliferation inhibitory rate and the apoptosis rate of breast cancer cells were determined by MTT assay, colony-forming assay and flow cytometry method. Then the breast cancer MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231/GFP or MDA-MB-231/BMP9 xenografts in nude mice were established. The volume of xenograft tumor was measured, and the apoptosis rate was detected by TUNEL assay. Results: There was no expression of BMP9 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/GFP cells, but the expression of BMP9 mRNA in MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells was significant. The proliferation inhibitory rate of MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells was higher than that of MDA-MB-231/GFP cells ( P<0.05). The colony-forming rate of MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells was lower than those of MDA-MB-231/GFP and MDA-MB-231 cells ( P<0.05). The apoptosis rate of MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells was higher than those of MDA-MB-231/GFP and MDA-MB-231 cells ( P<0.05). The xenograft tumor volume in the MDA-MB-231/BMP9 group was smaller than those in the MDA-MB-231/GFP and MDA-MB-231 groups ( P<0.001). The apoptosis index of xenograft tumor in the MDA-MB-231/BMP9 group was higher than those in the MDA-MB-231/GFP and MDA-MB-231 groups ( P<0.001). Conclusion: BMP9 can inhibit the proliferation ability and induce the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro and in vivo.

79958202199	BMP-9 induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells: Molecular mechanism and therapeutic potential	Promoting osteogenic differentiation and efficacious bone regeneration have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of orthopaedic and musculoskeletal disorders. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are bone marrow progenitor cells that have the capacity to differentiate along osteogenic, chondrogenic, myogenic, and adipogenic lineages. Differentiation along these lineages is a tightly controlled process that is in part regulated by the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs). BMPs 2 and 7 have been approved for clinical use because their osteoinductive properties act as an adjunctive treatment to surgeries where bone healing is compromised. BMP-9 is one of the least studied BMPs, and recent in vitro and in vivo studies have identified BMP-9 as a potent inducer of osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. BMP-9 exhibits significant molecular cross-talk with the Wnt/β-catenin and other signaling pathways, and adenoviral expression of BMP-9 in MSCs increases the expression of osteogenic markers and induces trabecular bone and osteiod matrix formation. Furthermore, BMP-9 has been shown to act synergistically in bone formation with other signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, IGF, and retinoid signaling pathways. These results suggest that BMP-9 should be explored as an effective bone regeneration agent, especially in combination with adjuvant therapies, for clinical applications such as large segmental bony defects, non-union fractures, and/or spinal fusions. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

79959417336	Mesenchymal progenitor cells and their orthopedic applications: Forging a path towards clinical trials	Mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are nonhematopoietic multipotent cells capable of differentiating into mesenchymal and nonmesenchymal lineages. While they can be isolated from various tissues, MPCs isolated from the bone marrow are best characterized. These cells represent a subset of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) which, in addition to their differentiation potential, are critical in supporting proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells. They are of clinical interest because they can be easily isolated from bone marrow aspirates and expanded in vitro with minimal donor site morbidity. The BMSCs are also capable of altering disease pathophysiology by secreting modulating factors in a paracrine manner. Thus, engineering such cells to maximize therapeutic potential has been the focus of cell/gene therapy to date. Here, we discuss the path towards the development of clinical trials utilizing BMSCs for orthopaedic applications. Specifically, we will review the use of BMSCs in repairing critical-sized defects, fracture nonunions, cartilage and tendon injuries, as well as in metabolic bone diseases and osteonecrosis. A review of www.ClinicalTrials.gov of the United States National Institute of Health was performed, and ongoing clinical trials will be discussed in addition to the sentinel preclinical studies that paved the way for human investigations.

Methods: Recombinant plasmids pGST-moluc-hS100A2 and pGST-moluc were transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed products were identified by Western blot, then purified with Glutathion-Sepharose 4B beads. HCT116 and SW480 cells were treated with the prepared GST-hS100A2 fusion protein, using those treated with GST and those untreated as controls, and determined for proliferative activity by MTT method, for apoptosis by Hochest33258 staining, for cell cycle by flow cytometry, for migration ability by wound healing assay, and for invasion ability by Transwell test. Results: GST-hS100A2 showed dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of HCT116 and SW480 cells. Meanwhile, the fusion protein significantly promoted the apoptosis and inhibited the invasion ability of both HCT116 and SW480 cells, while arrested the cell cycle and inhibited the migration of HCT116 cells. Conclusion: GST-hS100A2 showed a certain inhibitory effect on HCT116 and SW480 cells and might be used as a new target for molecular therapy of colorectal carcinoma.

80052703371	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of human osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of bone. There is a critical need to identify the events that lead to the poorly understood mechanism of OS development and metastasis. The goal of this investigation is to identify and characterize a novel marker of OS progression. We have established and characterized a highly metastatic OS subline that is derived from the less metastatic human MG63 line through serial passages in nude mice via intratibial injections. Microarray analysis of the parental MG63, the highly metastatic MG63.2 subline, as well as the corresponding primary tumors and pulmonary metastases revealed insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) to be one of the significantly downregulated genes in the metastatic subline. Confirmatory quantitative RT-PCR on 20 genes of interest demonstrated IGFBP5 to be the most differentially expressed and was therefore chosen to be one of the genes for further investigation. Adenoviral mediated overexpression and knockdown of IGFBP5 in the MG63 and MG63.2 cell lines, as well as other OS lines (143B and MNNG/HOS) that are independent of our MG63 lines, were employed to examine the role of IGFBP5. We found that overexpression of IGFBP5 inhibited in vitro cell proliferation, migration and invasion of OS cells. Additionally, IGFBP5 overexpression promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In an orthotopic xenograft animal model, overexpression of IGFBP5 inhibited OS tumor growth and pulmonary metastases. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IGFBP5 promoted OS tumor growth and pulmonary metastases in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of patient-matched primary and metastatic OS samples demonstrated decreased IGFBP5 expression in the metastases. These results suggest 1) a role for IGFBP5 as a novel marker that has an important role in the pathogenesis of OS, and 2) that the loss of IGFBP5 function may contribute to more metastatic phenotypes in OS. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

80052719188	Epigenetic regulation of mesenchymal stem cells: A focus on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation	Stem cells are characterized by their capability to self-renew and terminally differentiate into multiple cell types. Somatic or adult stem cells have a finite self-renewal capacity and are lineage-restricted. The use of adult stem cells for therapeutic purposes has been a topic of recent interest given the ethical considerations associated with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells that can differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, or myogenic lineages. Owing to their ease of isolation and unique characteristics, MSCs have been widely regarded as potential candidates for tissue engineering and repair. While various signaling molecules important to MSC differentiation have been identified, our complete understanding of this process is lacking. Recent investigations focused on the role of epigenetic regulation in lineage-specific differentiation of MSCs have shown that unique patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications play an important role in the induction of MSC differentiation toward specific lineages. Nevertheless, MSC epigenetic profiles reflect a more restricted differentiation potential as compared to ES cells. Here we review the effect of epigenetic modifications on MSC multipotency and differentiation, with a focus on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. We also highlight clinical applications of MSC epigenetics and nuclear reprogramming. Copyright © 2011 Chad M. Teven et al.

80054723100	BMP9 inhibits the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231	Background: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is known to promote tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are members of the TGF-β superfamily. Several BMPs (BMP2 and BMP7) can enhance the invasion and bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. The function of BMP9, the latest discovered and most powerful osteogenetic factor, in breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Methods: BMP9 expression in twenty-three breast cancer patients and three breast cancer cell line types was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Changes in proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and migration in the recombinant MDA-MB-231/BMP9 cells were detected using various assays. The assays were MTT, flow cytometry, colony forming, cell wounding, and transwell invasion. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and terminal deoxynucleotidy transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling staining methods were conducted to detect whether BMP9 affected proliferation and apoptosis in xenogenic mouse models. Results: Twenty-one of the twenty-three breast cancer patients had amplified BMP9 mRNA transcripts in adjacent non-tumor tissues, although BMP9 was observed in the breast cancer tissue of two patients, its expression was higher in the adjacent non-tumor tissues. BMP9 overexpression inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as induced the apoptosis of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro. BMP9 also inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis significantly in the xenogenic mouse models. Conclusions: Decreased BMP9 expression is associated with the elevated proliferation and migration of human breast cancer. BMP9 can inhibit the growth, invasion, and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. BMP9 is a putative tumor suppressor in breast cancer. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

Methods: The transcription of ALK2 mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells was determined by RT-PCR. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with adenovirus DN-ALK2 and RFP respectively, then determined for proliferation level by MTT method, for colony formation by plate colony formation test, for migration ability by cell wounding test, and for invasion ability by Transwell invasion test, using those uninfected as blank control. Results: ALK2 was highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells. Both the expression level of RFP in MDA-MB-231 cells 36 h after transfection with DNA-ALK2 and RFP were about 70%. DN-ALK2 was highly expressed in MDA-MB-231 / DN-ALK2 cells. The proliferation activity, colony formation rate, healing rate of wound and count of cells crossing the matrix barrier were significantly lower in MDA-MB-231 / DNA-ALK2 group than in MDA-MB-231 / RFP group (P < 0.05), while showed no significant difference in MDA-MB-231 / RFP and blank control groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: DN-ALK2 inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells in vitro.

84862490688	Growth hormone synergizes with BMP9 in osteogenic differentiation by activating the JAK/STAT/IGF1 pathway in murine multilineage cells	Growth hormone (GH) is usually released by somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary in response to the GH-releasing hormone and plays an important role in skeleton development and postnatal growth. However, it is unclear if extrapituitary GH exerts any effect on murine multilineage cells (MMCs). MMCs are multipotent progenitors that give rise to several lineages, including bone, cartilage, and fat. We have identified bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) as one of the most osteogenic BMPs in MMCs by regulating a distinct set of downstream mediators. In this study, we find that GH is one of the most significantly upregulated genes by BMP9 in mouse MMCs through expression-profiling analysis. We confirm that GH is a direct early target of and upregulated by BMP9 signaling. Exogenous GH synergizes with BMP9 on inducing early and late osteogenic markers in MMCs. Furthermore, BMP9 and GH costimulation leads to a significant expansion of growth plate in cultured limb explants. Although GH alone does not induce de novo bone formation in an ectopic bone formation model, BMP9 and GH costimulated MMCs form more mature bone, which can be inhibited by silencing GH expression. The synergistic osteogenic activity between BMP9 and GH can be significantly blunted by JAK/STAT inhibitors, leading to a decrease in GH-regulated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) expression in MMCs. Our results strongly suggest that BMP9 may effectively regulate extrapituitary GH expression in MMCs. Thus, it is conceivable that the BMP9-GH-IGF axis may be exploited as an innovative strategy to enhance osteogenesis in regenerative medicine. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

84862867348	All-trans retinoic acid inhibits tumor growth of human osteosarcoma by activating Smad signaling-induced osteogenic differentiation	Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common malignant bone tumors. Despite the advancement of diagnosis and treatment for OS, the prognosis remains poor. We investigated the proliferation inhibitory effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for human OS and the possible mechanism underlying this effect. We examined the proliferation inhibition and apoptosis-inducing effects of ATRA in 143B OS cells. We validated this effect by exogenously expressing the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARá) in 143B OS cells and injecting the cells into nude mice. We explored the possible mechanism for the proliferation inhibitory effect of ATRA on OS cells and multipotential progenitor cells by detecting osteogenic markers. We demonstrated that the endogenous retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor are all detectable in the commercially available OS cell lines and in primary osteosarcoma cells. ATRA inhibits the proliferation of OS cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as well as induces apoptosis in 143B OS cells. The exogenous expression of RARα inhibits the tumor growth and cell proliferation in vivo. The alkaline phosphatase activity, protein levels of osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) are all promoted by ATRA in OS cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), at least by activating the Smad signaling pathway. Collectively, our results strongly indicate that ATRA can inhibit the tumor growth of OS by promoting osteogenic differentiation in OS cells, which is mediated in part by activating Smad signaling. Therefore, combination of ATRA with other current chemotherapy agents may be a promising therapy strategy for OS treatment.

BMP9 was introduced into C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells by recombinant adenoviruses protocol, then, in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to evidence whether BMP9 can induce osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells through p38 kinase pathway. The results showed that BMP9 can activate p38 kinase through increasing the phosphorylated form of p38 kinase. P38 kinase inhibitor SB203580 can inhibit the ALP activity, OPN expression and calcium deposition of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by BMP9. Furthermore, SB203580 also led to inhibition of canonical Smad pathway activated by BMP9. Moreover, when p38 kinase was silenced by RNA interference in C3H10T1/2 cells, BMP9-induced ALP activity, OPN expression, calcium deposition and in invo ectopic bone formation were accordingly inhibited along with knockdown of p38 kinase. Taken together, those results intensively suggested that BMP9 can induce and regulate osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through activating p38 kinase pathway.

84863146866	Conditionally immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts retain proliferative activity without compromising multipotent differentiation potential	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells which reside in many tissues and can give rise to multiple lineages including bone, cartilage and adipose. Although MSCs have attracted significant attention for basic and translational research, primary MSCs have limited life span in culture which hampers MSCs' broader applications. Here, we investigate if mouse mesenchymal progenitors can be conditionally immortalized with SV40 large T antigen and maintain long-term cell proliferation without compromising their multipotency. Using the system which expresses SV40 large T antigen flanked with Cre/loxP sites, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be efficiently immortalized by SV40 large T antigen. The conditionally immortalized MEFs (iMEFs) exhibit an enhanced proliferative activity and maintain long-term cell proliferation, which can be reversed by Cre recombinase. The iMEFs express most MSC markers and retain multipotency as they can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages under appropriate differentiation conditions in vitro and in vivo. The removal of SV40 large T reduces the differentiation potential of iMEFs possibly due to the decreased progenitor expansion. Furthermore, the iMEFs are apparently not tumorigenic when they are subcutaneously injected into athymic nude mice. Thus, the conditionally immortalized iMEFs not only maintain long-term cell proliferation but also retain the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages. Our results suggest that the reversible immortalization strategy using SV40 large T antigen may be an efficient and safe approach to establishing long-term cell culture of primary mesenchymal progenitors for basic and translational research, as well as for potential clinical applications. © 2012 Huang et al.

84865097353	P38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs act in opposition to regulate BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Although previous studies have demonstrated that BMP9 is highly capable of inducing osteogenic differentiation and bone formation, the precise molecular mechanism involved remains to be fully elucidated. In this current study, we explore the possible involvement and detail effects of p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs on BMP9-indcued osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cell (MPCs). We find that BMP9 simultaneously stimulates the activation of p38 and ERK1/2 in MPCs. BMP9-induced early osteogenic marker, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and late osteogenic markers, such as matrix mineralization and osteocalcin (OC) are inhibited by p38 inhibitor SB203580, whereas enhanced by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. BMP9-induced activation of Runx2 and Smads signaling are reduced by SB203580, and yet increased by PD98059 in MPCs. The in vitro effects of inhibitors are reproduced with adenoviruses expressing siRNA targeted p38 and ERK1/2, respectively. Using mouse calvarial organ culture and subcutaneous MPCs implantation, we find that inhibition of p38 activity leads to significant decrease in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation and bone formation, however, blockage of ERK1/2 results in effective increase in BMP9-indcued osteogenic differentiation in vivo. Together, our results reveal that p38 and ERK1/2 MAPKs are activated in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. What is most noteworthy, however, is that p38 and ERK1/2 act in opposition to regulate BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. © 2012 Zhao et al.

84870006054	Study on the correlation between the anti-proliferation effect of berberine on HCT116 cells and Wnt/β-catenin signaling	Aim: To investigate the correlation between the anti-proliferation effect of berberine on HCT116 cells and Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction. Methods: Crystal violet staining was employed to detect the anti-proliferation effect of berberine on HCT116 cells. The apoptosis induced by berberine was detected by fluorescence activated cell sorting and Western blot. The β-catenin expression was measured by Western blot and reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCT). With exogenous expression of β-catenin, the role of β-catenin in berberine induced proliferation inhibitory effect on HCT116 cells was explored. Results: Berberine could inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells. The expression of β-catenin protein in whole cell, cytoplasm and nucleus was inhibited when treated HCT116 cells with different concentrations of berberine. So was the mRNA expression level of β-catenin. Exogenous expression of β-catenin could attenuate the anti-proliferation effect of berberine on HCT116 cells. Conclusions: Berberine can inhibit the proliferation of HCT116 cells and Wnt/β-catenin signaling transduction. This effect may be mediated at least by down regulating the mRNA expression of β-catenin.

84871415189	Biphasic effects of TGFβ1 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	We have found that the previously uncharacterized bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP9) is one of the most osteogenic factors. However, it is unclear if BMP9 cross-talks with TGFβ1 during osteogenic differentiation. Using the recombinant BMP9 adenovirus, we find that low concentration of rhTGFβ1 synergistically induces alkaline phosphatase activity in BMP9-transduced C3H10T1/2 cells and produces more pronounced matrix mineralization. However, higher concentrations of TGFβ1 inhibit BMP9-induced osteogenic activity. Real-time PCR and Western blotting indicate that BMP9 in combination with low dose of TGFβ1 potentiates the expression of later osteogenic markers osteopontin, osteocalcin and collagentype 1 (COL1a2), while higher concentrations of TGFβ1 decrease the expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin but not COL1a2. Cell cycle analysis reveals that TGFβ1 inhibits C3H10T1/2 proliferation in BMP9-induced osteogenesis and restricts the cells in G0/G1 phase. Our findings strongly suggest that TGFβ1 may exert a biphasic effect on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. © 2012 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

84872867316	Abnormal expression of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1 contributes to the anti-microtubule drug resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells	Esophageal cancer is a common malignancy with a high mortality rate. The lack of effective chemotherapy and a means to overcome drug resistance leads to the predictable failure of esophageal cancer treatment. Mitotic checkpoint proteins play a critical role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation. Abnormal expression of the mitotic checkpoint protein BubR1 has been reported in several types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of BubR1 in conferring resistance of esophageal cancer cells to anti-microtubule drugs. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis on 50 samples of paired esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESC) tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, we found that 72% (36 of 50) of the analyzed ESC samples exhibited high expression levels of BubR1, which was also confirmed in ESC cell lines. ESC cells with high levels of BubR1 were less sensitive to the anti-microtubule drugs paclitaxel and nocodazole. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated enforced expression of BubR1 in relatively sensitive ESC cell lines resulted in increased resistance to paclitaxel. Conversely, RNAi-mediated knockdown of BubR1 restored ESC cell sensitivity to paclitaxel. Cell cycle analysis indicated that the sub-G1 population increased in the ESC cells with reduced BubR1 levels. Taken together, our results suggest that upregulation of BubR1 expression may be associated with ESC resistance to paclitaxel treatment. Thus, BubR1 may serve as a potential chemosensitizing target to overcome chemoresistance.

84874089515	Role of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in proliferation and apoptosis of human osteosarcoma 143B cells	Aim: To observe the effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on proliferation and apoptosis of human osteosarcoma 143B cells and the possible mechanism. Methods: Human osteosarcoma cell line 143B was cultured in vitro; MTT [3 - (4,5) the-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-yl)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide,MTT] colorimetric assay and clone formation assay were applied to detect the role of DHA in the survival and growth status of human osteosarcoma cells. Hoechst 33258 cell staining was used for apoptosis detection. The luciferase reporter gene, β-Catenin-Luc (p-Top) was constructed to detect β-Catenin activity after DHA's role in 143B cells. The marker protein expression closely related to tumor cell proliferation, such as PCNA, Cyclin D1, C-Myc, and apoptosis, such as Bad, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, was detected by Western blot. Results: 24 hours after DHA played role in 142B, MTT results showed that DHA could inhibit the proliferation of the 143B cells, and colony formation diminished (P < 0.05), the inhibition efficiency increased significantly at a concentration of 35 μmol·L

84874710761	Analysis and characterization of the functional TGFβ receptors required for BMP6-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Although BMP6 is highly capable of inducing osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), the molecular mechanism involved remains to be fully elucidated. Using dominant negative (dn) mutant form of type I and type II TGFβ receptors, we demonstrated that three dn-type I receptors (dnALK2, dnALK3, dnALK6), and three dn-type II receptors (dnBMPRII, dnActRII, dnActRIIB), effectively diminished BMP6-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. These findings suggested that ALK2, ALK3, ALK6, BMPRII, ActRII and ActRIIB are essential for BMP6-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. However, MPCs in this study do not express ActRIIB. Moreover, RNA interference of ALK2, ALK3, ALK6, BMPRII and ActRII inhibited BMP6-induced osteogenic differentiation in MPCs. Our results strongly suggested that BMP6-induced osteogenic differentiation of MPCs is mediated by its functional TGFβ receptors including ALK2, ALK3, ALK6, BMPRII, and ActRII. © 2012 by the The Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

84874840299	The current and future therapies for human osteosarcoma	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common non-hematologic malignant tumor of bone in adults and children. As sarcomas are more common in adolescents and young adults than most other forms of cancer, there are a significant number of years of life lost secondary to these malignancies. OS is associated with a poor prognosis secondary to a high grade at presentation, resistance to chemotherapy and a propensity to metastasize to the lungs. Current OS management involves both chemotherapy and surgery. The incorporation of cytotoxic chemotherapy into therapeutic regimens escalated cure rates from <20% to current levels of 65-75%. Furthermore, limb-salvage surgery is now offered to the majority of OS patients. Despite advances in chemotherapy and surgical techniques over the past three decades, there has been stagnation in patient survival outcome improvement, especially in patients with metastatic OS. Thus, there is a critical need to identify novel and directed therapy for OS. Several Phase I trials for sarcoma therapies currently ongoing or recently completed have shown objective responses in OS. Novel drug delivery mechanisms are currently under phase II and III clinical trials. Furthermore, there is an abundance of preclinical research which holds great promise in the development of future OSdirected therapeutics. Our continuously improving knowledge of the molecular and cell-signaling pathways involved in OS will translate into more effective therapies for OS and ultimately improved patient survival. The present review will provide an overview of current therapies, ongoing clinical trials and therapeutic targets under investigation for OS. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84876878662	S100A8 and S100A9 Are Associated with Colorectal Carcinoma Progression and Contribute to Colorectal Carcinoma Cell Survival and Migration via Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway	Background and Objective:S100A8 and S100A9, two members of the S100 protein family, have been reported in association with the tumor cell differentiation and tumor progression. Previous study has showed that their expression in stromal cells of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is associated with tumor size. Here, we investigated the clinical significances of S100A8 and S100A9 in tumor cells of CRC and their underlying molecular mechanisms.Methods:Expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in colorectal carcinoma and matching distal normal tissues were measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and western blot. CRC cell lines treated with the recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 proteins were used to analyze the roles and molecular mechanisms of the two proteins in CRC in vitro.Results:S100A8 and S100A9 were elevated in more than 50% of CRC tissues and their expression in tumor cells was associated with differentiation, Dukes stage and lymph node metastasis. The CRC cell lines treatment with recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 proteins promoted the viability and migration of CRC cells. Furthermore, the two recombinant proteins also resulted in the increased levels of β-catenin and its target genes c-myc and MMP7. β-catenin over-expression in CRC cells by Adβ-catenin increased cell viability and migration. β-catenin knock-down by Adsiβ-catenin reduced cell viability and migration. Furthermore, β-catenin knockdown also partially abolished the promotive effects of recombinant S100A8 and S100A9 proteins on the viability and migration of CRC cells.Conclusions:Our work demonstrated that S100A8 and S100A9 are linked to the CRC progression, and one of the underlying molecular mechanisms is that extracellular S100A8 and S100A9 proteins contribute to colorectal carcinoma cell survival and migration via Wnt/β-catenin pathway. © 2013 Duan et al.

84882565009	Dihydroartemisinin inhibits tumor growth of human osteosarcoma cells by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of bone cancer. Even with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment, the prognosis for OS is poor. In the present study, we investigated the proliferation and invasion inhibitory effect of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) on human OS cells and the possible molecular mechanisms involved. We demonstrated that DHA can inhibit proliferation, decrease migration, reduce invasion and induce apoptosis in human OS cells. Using an in vivo tumor animal model, we confirmed that DHA can prevent OS formation and maintain intact bone structure in athymic mice. In addition, we examined the possible molecular mechanisms mediating the function of DHA. We found that the total protein levels and transcriptional activity of β-catenin in OS cells are reduced by DHA treatment, and this may result from the increased catalytic activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of DHA on OS cells is reversed by overexpression of β-catenin, but is further enhanced by knockdown of β-catenin, respectively. Collectively, our results reveal that DHA can inhibit tumor growth of OS cells by inactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Therefore, DHA is a promising chemotherapy agent in the treatment of human OS.

84884891747	Fibroblast growth factor 2 inhibits bone morphogenetic protein9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells byrepressing Smads signaling and subsequently reducing Smadsdependent up-regulation of ALK1 and ALK2	Understanding the interactions between growth factors and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) signaling remains a crucial issue to optimize the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and BMPs in bone tissue engineering. BMP9 is highly capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is abundantly secreted during the healing process of fractures or in surgery bone sites.Herein, we explore the detail effect of FGF2 on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It was found that FGF2 inhibited BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation by blocking BMP9-induced Smads signaling and subsequently reducing Smads dependent up-regulation of ALK1 and ALK2 in MSCs. This effect was rescued by exogenous expression of ALK1 and ALK2, which are proved to be receptors for BMP9. Our results discovered a clue to explain the mechanism involved in the inhibitory effect of FGF2on BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. This crosstalk between FGF2 and BMP9 should beemphasized in the future use of BMP9 in therapeutic purpose of fracture repair. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884567875	Activation of JNKs is essential for BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Although BMP9 is highly capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs), the molecular mechanism involved remains to be fully elucidated. Here, we explore the possible involvement and detail role of JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. It was found that BMP9 stimulated the activation of JNKs in MSCs. BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs was dramatically inhibited by JNKs inhibitor SP600125. Moreover, BMP9-activated Smads signaling was decreased by SP600125 treatment in MSCs. The effects of inhibitor are reproduced with adenoviruses expressing siRNA targeted JNKs. Taken together, our results revealed that JNKs was activated in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. What is most noteworthy, however, is that inhibition of JNKs activity resulted in reduction of BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, implying that activation of JNKs is essential for BMP9 osteoinductive activity.

84884167287	BMP9 and COX-2 form an important regulatory loop in BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can self-renew and differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic and myogenic lineages. It's reported that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is one of the most potent osteogenic BMPs to initiate the commitment of MSCs to osteoblast lineage. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is critical for bone fracture healing and osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. However, the relationship between COX-2 and BMP9 in osteogenesis remains unknown. Herein, we investigate the role of COX-2 in BMP9-induced osteogenesis in MSCs. We demonstrate that COX-2 is up-regulated as a target of BMP9 in MSCs. Both COX-2 inhibitor (NS-398) and COX-2 knockdown siRNAs can effectively decrease alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities induced by BMP9 in MSCs. NS-398 also down-regulates BMP9-induced expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin, so does the matrix mineralization. The in vivo studies indicate that knockdown of COX-2 attenuates BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation. In perinatal limb culture assay, NS-398 is shown to reduce the hypertropic chondrocyte zone and ossification induced by BMP9. Mechanistically, knockdown of COX-2 significantly inhibits the BMP9 up-regulated expression of Runx2 and Dlx-5 in MSCs, which can be rescued by exogenous expression of COX-2. Furthermore, knockdown of COX-2 apparently reduces BMP9 induced BMPR-Smad reporter activity, the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and the expression of Smad6 and Smad7 in MSCs. NS-398 blocks the expression of BMP9 mediated by BMP9 recombinant adenovirus. Taken together, our findings suggest that COX-2 plays an important role in BMP9 induced osteogenic differentiation in MSCs; BMP9 and COX-2 may form an important regulatory loop to orchestrate the osteogenic differentiation in MSCs. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Crystal violet staining and flow cytometry were employed to detect the anti-proliferative effect of tetrandrine on HCT116 cells. Flow cytometry and immunoflurescense with annexin-V EGFP were used to detect the apoptosis drived by tetrandrine in HCT116 cells. Luciferase reporter assay was introduced to measure the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signal. Western blot was used to detect the protein level of β-catenin in HCT116 cells. Results: Tetrandrine inhibited the proliferation and promoted cell cycle arrest in HCT116 cells in a concentration-dependent fashion, so did the apoptosis. The transcriptional activities of LEF/TCF4 and Myc/Max were both reduced by tetrandrine in a concentration-dependent fashion. The protein level of β-catenin was decreased by tetrandrine in HCT116 cells. Conclusions: Tetrandrine can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in HCT116 cells. These effects may be mediated by blocking Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction through reducing the protein level of β-catenin.

84896050649	BMP9 inhibits the bone metastasis of breast cancer cells by downregulating CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) expression	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which belong to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, regulate a wide range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. BMP9, the latest BMP to be discovered, is reportedly expressed in a variety of human carcinoma cell lines, but the role of BMP9 in breast cancer has not been fully clarified. In a previous study, BMP9 was found to inhibit the growth, migration, and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In the current study, the effect of BMP9 on the bone metastasis of breast cancer cells was investigated. After absent or low expression of BMP9 was detected in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and breast non-tumor adjacent tissues using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, In our previous study, BMP9 could inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness of breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo. This paper shows that BMP9 inhibit the bone metastasis of breast cancer cells by activating the BMP/Smad signaling pathway and downregulating connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); however, when CTGF expression was maintained, the inhibitory effect of BMP9 on the MDA-MB-231 cells was abolished. Together, these observations indicate that BMP9 is an important mediator of breast cancer bone metastasis and a potential therapeutic target for treating this deadly disease. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.

Methods: C3H10T1/2 cells were divided into six groups. The cells in blank control group were treated, while those in GFP, GFP + DMSO, BMP9 + DMSO, BMP9 + H89 (10 μmol/L) and BMP9 groups were infected with 30% AdGFP, 30% AdGFP + DMSO, BMP9, 30% BMP9 + DMSO, 30% AdBMP9 + 10 μmol/L H89 and 30% adBMP9 respectively, then determined for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and subjected to calcium salt sedimentation test, based on which the effects of H89 on early and late osteogenic differentiations of C3H10T1/2 cells induced by BMP9 were observed. Meanwhile, C3H10T1/2 cells were divided into blank control, GFP, BMP9 and BMP9 + H89 (10 μmol/L) groups, and observed for effect of H89 on expression levels of phosphorylated CREB, osteocalcin (OCN) and osteogenic key transcription factor Runx2 by Western blot, and for that on classical signaling pathway BMPs-smad1/5/8 by Western blot and test for luciferase report gene. Results: H80 showed dose-dependent inhibitory effect on BMP9-induced ALP activity in C3H10T1/2 cells (P < 0.05). The ALP activity in BMP9 + H89 (10 μmol/L) group was significantly lower than that in blank control group (P < 0.05). The calcium salt sedimentation level in BMP9 + H89 (10 μmol/L) group was significantly lower than those in BMP9 + DMSO and BMP9 groups. H89 inhibited the expressions of phosporylatd CREB, OCN and Runx2, and the relative expression levels of various proteins in BMP9 group showed significant difference with those in BMP + H89 (10 μmol/L) group (P < 0.05). H89 showed no significant effect on classical signaling pathway BMPs-smad1/5/8. The relative expression levels of phosphorylated smad1/5/8 in BMP9 and BMP9 + H89 groups showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Blocking cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway inhibited the BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells, which laid a theoretical foundation of clinical application of BMP9.

84898045760	BMP9 regulates osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through JNKs kinase pathway	In addition to Smad pathway, our previous study has shown that BMP9 can induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through p38 MAPKs pathway. In this study, we explore the possible involvement and detail role of JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) in BMP9-indcued osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. BMP9 was introduced into MSCs by recombinant adenoviruses protocol, then, in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to detect whether BMP9 can induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through JNKs kinase pathway. The results showed that BMP9 can activate JNKs kinase through increase the phosphorylated form of JNKs kinase. JNKs kinase inhibitor SP600125 can inhibit ALP activity, OPN and OCN expression, as well as calcium deposition induced by BMP9 in MSCs. Furthermore, SP600125 also led to a decrease in BMP9-induced Runx2 activity and canonical Smad signaling. Moreover, when JNKs kinase was silenced by RNA interference in MSCs, BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo were accordingly inhibited along with knockdown of JNKs. Taken together, those results intensively suggested that BMP9 can induce and regulate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs through activating JNKs kinase pathway.

84899582924	Transplantation KCNMA1 modified bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cell therapy for diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction	Summary: This study assessed the effect of KCNMA1 transfected bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on the improvement of erectile function in diabetic rats. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) and screened with apomorphine (APO) to establish diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction (DMED). DMED rats were randomly divided into four groups: rats in each group underwent intracavernous injection with either phosphate buffer solution (DMED+PBS), nontransfected MSCs (DMED+MSCs), empty vector transfected MSCs (DMED+null-MSCs) or KCNMA1 transfected MSCs (DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs). Before injection, high levels of KCNMA1 expression were confirmed in KCNMA1-MSCs using RT-PCR and Western blotting. The lentivirus transfected MSCs maintained their potential for multidirectional differentiation. Four weeks after injection, erectile function was ascertained by measuring intracavernous pressure (ICP). Penile tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of KCNMA1 in the corpus cavernosum was increased, and the DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs group displayed a significant improvement of erectile function. We concluded that KCNMA1 was able to enhance the positive effect of MSCs in the treatment of diabetes-associated erectile dysfunction. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

84902576168	The PTEN/PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways are involved in the inhibitory effect of resveratrol on human colon cancer cell proliferation	Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the treatments for colon cancer have been developed substantially in the last decades, but there is still a great clinical need to explore new treatment regimens due to the undesirable prognosis. In this investigation, we demonstrated the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities of resveratrol (Res) in human colon cancer cells, and the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. We used crystal violet staining, flow cytometry and western blotting to validate the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of Res on HCT116 cells. A xenograft tumor model was used to confirm the anti-proliferative effects of Res. We employed polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, recombinant adenovirus and luciferase reporter assay to explore the possible mechanism(s) of action. We found that Res inhibits significantly the proliferation and promotes apoptosis in HCT116 cells, as well as inhibits the xenograft tumor growth of colon cancer. Res upregulates the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and decreases the phosphorylation of Akt1/2. The exogenous expression of PTEN inhibits the PI3K/Akt signal and promotes the anti-proliferative effects of Res in HCT116 cells, while knockdown of PTEN increases PI3K/Akt signal but reduces the anti-proliferative function of Res. The protein and mRNA expression of β-catenin are all decreased by Res concentration-dependently. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of Res in human colon cancer cells may be mediated by regulating separately the PTEN/PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

84902594810	Oridonin inhibits the proliferation of human osteosarcoma cells by suppressing Wnt/β-catenin signaling	It has been reported that oridonin (ORI) can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in various types of cancer cell lines. However, the exact mechanism for this function remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the proliferation inhibitory effect of ORI on human osteosarcoma (OS) 143B cells and dissected the possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this effect. We demonstrated that ORI can inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle in 143B cells. Using luciferase reporter assay, we found that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling was inhibited in 143B cells by ORI. Accordingly, the total protein levels and nuclear translocation of β-catenin were reduced by ORI treatment. ORI increased glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity and upregulated Dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1) expression. We found that Dkk-1 overexpression or β-catenin knockdown can potentiate the proliferation inhibitory effect of ORI in 143B cells, while β-catenin overexpression attenuated this effect. Using the xenograft tumor model of human OS, we demonstrated that ORI effectively inhibited the growth of tumors. Histological examination showed that ORI inhibited cancer cell proliferation, decreased the expression of PNCA and β-catenin. Our findings suggest that ORI can inhibit 143B OS cell proliferation by downregulating Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction, which may be mediated by upregulating the Dkk-1 expression and/or enhancing the function of GSK3β. Therefore, ORI can be potentially used as an effective adjuvant agent for the clinical management of OS.
