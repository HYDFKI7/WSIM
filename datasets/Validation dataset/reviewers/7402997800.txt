33745728208	Snoring and vascular risk factors and disease in a low-risk Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Study Objective: Snoring is a common condition, but data describing the relationship between snoring and vascular disease is very limited in Asian populations. We therefore describe the association between snoring and vascular disease and associated risk factors. Design: Cross-sectional study of baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Setting: Community-based elderly association from Guangzhou, China. Participants: 10413 Chinese subjects (50-85 years of age). Measurements: Self-reported snoring status and frequency and frequency of daytime tiredness were collected by questionnaire, as were demographic and socioeconomic data, disease histories, and potential confounders, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Anthropometry, blood pressure, and fasting glucose and lipid profile were also measured. Results: Self-reported snoring frequency was identified in 8325 (80.0%) subjects, with 51.6% reporting that they snored, of whom 15.5% were daily snorers. Increasing prevalence of snoring showed a clear positive relationship with cardiovascular risk factors, including age, obesity, blood pressure, and lipid levels (p < .001 for all). The prevalence of self-reported vascular-disease history was low but significantly associated with increasing snoring frequency. Logistic regression showed that snoring frequency was an independent predictor of vascular-disease history (odds ratios [95% confidence intervals] 1.68 [1.32-2.13] for daily snorers compared with the never-snorer reference group), of the metabolic syndrome (2.16 [1.88-2.49]) and each of its components (hypertension [1.37 (1.20-1.56)], and of dyslipidemia [1.22 (1.07-1.40)], central obesity [2.39 (2.08-2.76)], and diabetes [1.30 (1.09-1.56)]) after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusion: Increasing snoring frequency was associated with an increasing prevalence of risk factors and self-reported vascular disease. Snoring may a useful marker for increased risk of vascular disease.

33745887496	Association of vascular risk factors with increasing glycemia even in normoglycemic subjects in an older Chinese population: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Hyperglycemia increases cardiovascular disease risk, but the association between increasing glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors, angina, and coronary heart disease in normoglycemic subjects is less clear, particularly in Chinese. We report on possible associations in a large group of Mainland Chinese subjects. A total of 10 400 older subjects (≥50 years) were recruited, and vascular risk factors were measured, including anthropometry, blood pressure, and fasting plasma biochemical factors including glucose, lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Subjects were categorized by glycemic status, and the relationship between glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors was investigated using analysis of variance and multiple linear regression analyses. Tertiles of fasting glucose levels showed a clear positive relationship with cardiovascular risk factors including age, obesity, blood pressure, lipid levels, and CRP (P < .001 for all). The overall prevalence of self-reported vascular disease was low, but significantly associated with increasing glycemia. Multiple regression showed that waist circumference (standardized regression coefficient β = .10, P < .001), triglycerides (β = 0.16, P < .001), CRP (β = 0.06, P < .001), female sex (β = .03, P = .007), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β = -.02, P = .016), and mean arterial pressure (β = .06, P < .001) were independently associated with fasting glucose levels. Among the normoglycemic subjects (n = 5190), increasing glycemia was still associated with increasing obesity indices, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and CRP levels (all P < .05). Increasing glycemia, even in the reference range, is associated with increasing prevalence of vascular risk factors. Control of these risk factors, particularly obesity, the most important avoidable independent determinant of glycemia in normoglycemic subjects, is critical to reduce the risk of the associated vascular disease. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33748791190	Parity and the metabolic syndrome in older Chinese women: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To examine whether parity or gravidity contributes to the development of the metabolic syndrome (MS). Methods: The first phase of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study recruited 7352 women and 3065 men aged 50-93 years in 2003-4. Data on the number of live births and pregnancies, other reproduction-associated factors and socioeconomic and lifestyles factors were collected by standardized interview. The MS components were determined through physical examination and measurement of fasting blood samples. MS was identified if waist circumference was ≥ 90 cm for men or ≥ 80 cm for women, plus any two of: (a) raised triglyceride (TG) level (1·7 mmol/l) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality; (b) reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (< 1·03 mmol/l in males or < 1·29 mmol/l in females) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality; (c) raised blood pressure (BP, systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 85 mmHg) or hypertension therapy; and (d) raised fasting glucose (≥ 5·6 mmol/l) or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Results: Before adjustment for potential confounders, we found associations between the number of births and lifestyle and socioeconomic factors in both sexes. However, in women, but not in men, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio, triglyceride and glucose were positively associated with the number of birth after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. The age-adjusted prevalence of the MS increased with the number of births and pregnancies in women, but the gradient for birth was steeper than that for pregnancies [odds ratio change per birth 1·16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·11-1·22, P < 0·001; odds ratio change per pregnancy 1·11, 95% CI 1·06-1·16, P < 0·001], although attenuating the association adjustment did not affect the significance of these findings. There was no association in men with regard to the number of their partners' live births given the same analysis and similar shared living background with the women. Conclusion: Higher parity or gravidity was associated with a consistent increase in the risk of MS in Chinese women. As the association persisted after adjustment for lifestyle factors and there was no association between the risk of MS and the number of births associated with the partners of the males, the association in women may represent a biological response to pregnancy. © 2006 The Authors.

33846955816	Association of the metabolic syndrome with vascular disease in an older Chinese population: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To assess the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (MS) and relative associations with vascular disease in an older Chinese population using the US National Cholesterol Education Program: Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP: ATP III) and International Diabetes Federation (IDF) definitions. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: A total of 3035 men and 7291 women aged 50 to 85 yr recruited from Guangzhou, China. Measurements: All participants received a full medical check-up including measurement of blood pressure, obesity indices, fasting total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides (TG) and glucose levels. Demographic information and self-reported history of physician-diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) were collected through standardized interview. Results: The estimates under the two definitions differed substantially, with the age standardized prevalence of MS 15.57% using the NCEP: ATP III definition and 25.81% using the IDF definition. Among all participants, 80.23% were similarly classified using both definitions. The association between self-reported CHD, stroke and MI and the MS defined by the IDF definition was stronger than that by the NCEP: ATP III. Conclusions: The IDF compared to the ATP III definition shows a stronger association with the MS and associated vascular disease in Chinese. The prevalence of the MS is alarmingly high in this older Chinese population. Comprehensive strategies are needed for prevention and treatment of the MS to reduce the increased societal burden of cardiovascular disease in China. © 2006, Editrice Kurtis.

34548220492	Passive smoking exposure and risk of COPD among adults in China: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of mortality in China, where the population is also exposed to high levels of passive smoking, yet little information exists on the effects of such exposure on COPD. We examined the relation between passive smoking and COPD and respiratory symptoms in an adult Chinese population. Methods: We used baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Of 20 430 men and women over the age of 50 recruited in 2003-06, 15 379 never smokers (6497 with valid spirometry) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. We measured passive smoking exposure at home and work by two self-reported measures (density and duration of exposure). Diagnosis of COPD was based on spirometry and defined according to the GOLD guidelines. Findings: There was an association between risk of COPD and self-reported exposure to passive smoking at home and work (adjusted odds ratio 1·48, 95% CI 1·18-1·85 for high level exposure; equivalent to 40 h a week for more than 5 years). There were significant associations between reported respiratory symptoms and increasing passive smoking exposure (1·16, 1·07-1·25 for any symptom). Interpretation: Exposure to passive smoking is associated with an increased prevalence of COPD and respiratory symptoms. If this association is causal, we estimate that 1·9 million excess deaths from COPD among never smokers could be attributable to passive smoking in the current population in China. Our findings provide strong evidence for urgent measures against passive smoking in China. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34848907103	c-Reactive protein and the metabolic syndrome in older Chinese: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To examine the association between serum c-reactive protein (CRP) concentration and the metabolic syndrome (MS) using the International Diabetes Federation Metabolic Syndrome Guidelines (April, 2005) definition in an older Chinese population. Methods: Three thousand and fourteen men and 7275 women aged 50-85 years were recruited and received a full medical check-up including measurement of blood pressure, obesity indices, fasting total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and c-reactive protein. Data describing socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was also collected. Results: Vascular risk factors including waist circumference, weight gain and waist gain since the age of 18, body mass index, waist-hip-ratio, triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were positively associated with CRP in both men and women (p from <0.001 to 0.016). Compared to those without MS components, adjusted odds ratios for having elevated CRP increased in those with the MS or its components compared those without MS or components (all p < 0.001), except for the low HDL-cholesterol in both genders and raised fasting glucose in men. Similarly, the risk of elevated CRP increased with escalating MS components even after adjustment of a range of potential confounders. Conclusions: There is a strong relationship between CRP and the constellation of MS components and associated vascular risk in this older Chinese population. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

34948821151	Height, its components, and cardiovascular risk among older Chinese: A cross-sectional analysis of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objectives. Better childhood conditions, inferred from height and specifically leg length, are usually protective against ischemic heart disease and its risk factors in Western countries. In other geo-ethnic populations, height is less clearly protective, casting doubt on there being a biological etiology. To clarify the role of childhood conditions, we examined the associations of height and its components with cardiovascular risk among older Chinese people. Methods. We used multivariable regression to examine the associations of height and its components with blood pressure, lipid profile, and diabetes in 10413 older Chinese adults (mean age=64.6 years). Results. After we adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle habits, greater sitting height was associated with diabetes and dyslipidemia. Longer legs were associated with lower pulse pressure and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions. We provide indirect anthropometric evidence for the role of prepubertal and pubertal exposures on cardiovascular risk. Pubertal exposures are stronger than are prepubertal exposures but may be influenced by osteoporotic decline in old age. Further research should establish whether the observed relations are ethnically specific or relate to the stage or trajectory of socioeconomic development.

37349056086	Age of menarche and the metabolic syndrome in China	OBJECTIVES: In western populations, young age of menarche is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Little is known about the potential impact of menarche on the metabolic syndrome (as a proxy for cardiovascular risk) in rapidly economically developing populations where age of menarche is falling. We sought to determine the relation between age of menarche and the metabolic syndrome in a rapidly developing Chinese population. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective historical cohort study of 7349 women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study, China, enrolled in 2003-2004. Cardiovascular risk factors were obtained from physical examination; age of menarche was obtained from self-report. The main outcome measure was the metabolic syndrome and its components. RESULTS: Adjusted for age, education, and number of pregnancies, young age of menarche (<12.5 years) compared with age of menarche ≤14.5 years was associated with a higher risk of the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio = 1.49; 95% confidence interval = 1.22-1.82), central obesity (1.35; 1.10-1.65), raised blood pressure (1.34; 1.09-1.65), raised fasting glucose (1.40; 1.15-1.71), and higher triglyceride levels (1.36; 1.12-1.67). Further adjustment by waist circumference attenuated these effects, but the odds ratios remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Earlier age of menarche experienced by younger women in China today, now 12.5 years on average in urban populations, may contribute to an increase in the metabolic syndrome and thereby an increase in cardiovascular disease as these women age. These results further highlight the importance of childhood antecedents of adulthood disease. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

38649127908	Implications of increased weight and waist circumference on vascular risk in an older Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: The relationships between weight and waist on vascular risk are well described, but the long-term impact of these parameters is less clearly defined, particularly in Chinese populations. Methods: Ten thousand four hundred and ten older subjects (50-85 years) were recruited and blood pressure, anthropometric, and fasting vascular risk factors measured. Socioeconomic and demographic data, including self-reported weight and waist gain since 18 years. The association of weight and waist gain with these vascular risk factors was analysed. Results: Weight, and particularly waist gain were associated with a more adverse vascular risk factor profile, with the most adverse profile associated with gains in both weight and waist. Anthropometric gains were associated with increased risk even in non-obese subjects (p < 0.05). Even after adjustment for a range of demographic and socioeconomic factors, waist gain was associated with additional risk of having the metabolic syndrome and its components and self-reported vascular disease in those centrally obese subjects (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion: Increased weight and waist increased the level of vascular risk factors and self-reported disease in both non-obese and obese subjects. The high prevalence of vascular risk factors in this population forewarns of a major developing health burden in the rapidly modernising 1.2 billion Chinese population. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

39349118212	Life-course origins of social inequalities in metabolic risk in the population of a developing country	In countries that have been industrialized for a long time, but not always elsewhere, low socioeconomic position (SEP) is associated with ischemic heart disease in men. The authors hypothesized that socioeconomic development could, via pubertal sex steroids, promote an atherogenic lipid profile and body shape in men but not in women. Therefore, they examined the associations of SEP with ischemic heart disease risk in a developing-country population. The authors used multivariable regression to examine the associations of SEP with the metabolic syndrome and its components in 9,746 Chinese adults aged ≥50 years from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study, phase 2, recruited in 2005-2006. After adjustment for age, smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity, high SEP at each of three life stages, proxied by parental possessions in childhood, education, and longest held-occupation, was inversely associated with the metabolic syndrome in women but not in men. Higher SEP in men was associated with lower pulse pressure and fasting plasma glucose level but also with greater waist circumference and a lower high density lipoprotein cholesterol level. With socioeconomic development, diet-related hormonal changes at puberty may outweigh the usual protective effect of social advantage in men, with corresponding implications for boys currently undergoing the nutrition transition in the developing world. © The Author 2007.

38849202510	Is leg length a biomarker of childhood conditions in older Chinese women? The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: In developed western populations longer legs have been shown to be a biomarker of better early childhood conditions. It was hypothesised that in transitioning populations better childhood conditions may bring forward puberty and thus decrease leg length, counteracting the overall positive effect of a favourable childhood environment on leg growth. Design: Structural equation modelling was used to assess the interrelationship of age, education, father's job, age of menarche and leg length in a cross-sectional sample of 7273 Chinese women aged at least 50 years from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results: Leg length had no significant association with education or father's occupation on bivariable testing. After including age of menarche in the model, education was associated with longer legs (0.45 cm longer per 10 years of education, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.71). Education was also associated with younger age of menarche (1.21 years younger per 10 years of education, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.34), which was in turn associated with shorter legs (0.23 cm shorter per year of menarche earlier, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.27). Conclusions: In older Chinese women leg length is not a universal biomarker of childhood conditions, when proxied by her educational level and father's occupation. Nutritionally driven epigenetic influences operating over generations may constrain growth in very recently developed populations. Given the impact of childhood conditions on health, and the dearth of long-term records outside the industrialised world, a greater understanding of the influences on growth in the developing world is required.

38349194127	Reliability and validity of the IPAQ-Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	INTRODUCTION: Valid measurements of self-reported physical activity are very limited in Chinese populations, especially the elderly. Therefore, we examined the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-C) in older Chinese people. METHODS: Two hundred twenty-four older adults (66.1% women, 33.9% men, mean age 65.2 ± 5.7 yr) were randomly selected from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study, a prospective cohort of older Chinese in Southern China. To examine the test-retest reliability, the participants completed the IPAQ-C twice during a 7-d interval. The criterion validity of the IPAQ-C was tested with pedometry. RESULTS: Good reliability was observed between the repeated IPAQ-C, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) ranging from 0.81 to 0.89. Total activity measured by IPAQ-C correlated moderately with the pedometer-measured steps (partial r = 0.33 adjusted for sex, age, and education; P < 0.001). The walking domain of IPAQ-C was strongly associated with the number of steps (partial r = 0.58, P < 0.001), but there were no significant associations between other activity domains of the IPAQ-C and the pedometer data. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported validation study of an international standardized questionnaire (IPAQ-C) in older Chinese adults. Our study shows that the IPAQ-C is adequately valid and reliable for assessing total physical activity and that it may be a useful instrument for generating internationally comparable data on physical activity in this population. ©2008The American College of Sports Medicine.

80052297899	Usefulness of physical fitness and the metabolic syndrome to predict vascular disease risk in older Chinese (from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-Cardiovascular Disease Subcohort [GBCS-CVD])	Physical fitness can independently lower the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We explored the independent and combined associations of physical fitness, measured using the seated at rest heart rate (RHR), and the metabolic syndrome (MS), with CVD risk, as described by an elevated pulse wave velocity (PWV) in older Chinese. Data from 1,996 participants were drawn from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-Cardiovascular Disease Subcohort. Analysis of variance and logistic regression analysis were used to establish the independent and combined associations of the RHR and the MS with PWV. The RHR was independently associated with an elevated PWV (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22 to 2.18), as was the MS (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.76 to 3.17). The participants with a high RHR, but without the MS, had an adjusted OR of 1.63 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.30) for the presence of the CVD proxy. Those with a low RHR and the MS had an adjusted OR of 2.35 (95% CI 1.66 to 3.33). The risk of an elevated PWV increased almost fourfold with both a high RHR and a diagnosis of the MS (OR 3.87, 95% CI 2.39 to 6.28, p = 0.52 for interaction). In conclusion, physical fitness, measured using the RHR, and the MS are independently associated with an elevated PWV, a surrogate marker for CVD. The strength of this association was further increased in the presence of both. These findings confirm the beneficial effects of physical fitness on attenuating the risk of CVD among older Chinese. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All Rights Reserved.

84877868987	Study protocol for "moving Bright, Eating Smart"- A phase 2 clinical trial on the acceptability and feasibility of a diet and physical activity intervention to prevent recurrence in colorectal cancer survivors	Background: Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer and cancer-killer in Hong Kong with an alarming increasing incidence in recent years. The latest World Cancer Research Fund report concluded that foods low in fibre, and high in red and processed meat cause colorectal cancer whereas physical activity protects against colon cancer. Yet, the influence of these lifestyle factors on cancer outcome is largely unknown even though cancer survivors are eager for lifestyle modifications. Observational studies suggested that low intake of a Western-pattern diet and high physical activity level reduced colorectal cancer mortality. The Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Health Action Process Approach have guided the design of intervention models targeting a wide range of health-related behaviours. Methods/design. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of two behavioural interventions intended to improve colorectal cancer outcome and which are designed to increase physical activity level and reduce consumption of a Western-pattern diet. This three year study will be a multicentre, randomised controlled trial in a 2x2 factorial design comparing the "Moving Bright, Eating Smart" (physical activity and diet) programme against usual care. Subjects will be recruited over a 12-month period, undertake intervention for 12 months and followed up for a further 12 months. Baseline, interim and three post-intervention assessments will be conducted.Two hundred and twenty-two colorectal cancer patients who completed curative treatment without evidence of recurrence will be recruited into the study. Primary outcome measure will be whether physical activity and dietary targets are met at the end of the 12-month intervention. Secondary outcome measures include the magnitude and mechanism of behavioural change, the degree and determinants of compliance, and the additional health benefits and side effects of the intervention. Discussion. The results of this study will establish the feasibility of targeting the two behaviours (diet and physical activity) and demonstrate the magnitude of behaviour change. The information will facilitate the design of a further larger phase III randomised controlled trial with colorectal cancer outcome as the study endpoint to determine whether this intervention model would reduce colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality.

84897039510	Milk consumption and cardiovascular risk factors in older Chinese: The Guangzhou biobank cohort study	Background: Dairy products consumption is increasingly common globally. Most of the evidence concerning dairy products comes from observational studies in western populations which are inevitably open to confounding. To triangulate the evidence concerning dairy products, we examined the associations of whole cow's milk consumption with cardiovascular risk factors in a non-Western setting with a different pattern of milk consumption and cardiovascular diseases from Western populations. Methods: We used multivariable censored linear or logistic regression to examine cross-sectionally the adjusted associations of whole cow's milk consumption (none (n = 14892), 1-3/week (n = 2689) and 3+/week (n = 2754)) with cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese (≥50 years) in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results: Whole cow's milk consumption was negatively associated with systolic blood pressure (3+/week compared to none -2.56 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.63 to -1.49), diastolic blood pressure (-1.32 mmHg, 95% CI -1.87 to -0.77) and triglycerides (-0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.002), but was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol (0.02 mmol/L,95% CI 0.01 to 0.04) and fasting glucose (0.08 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.16) adjusted for age, sex, phase of study, socio-economic position, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol use and physical activity) and adiposity, but had no obvious association with LDL-cholesterol or the presence of diabetes. Conclusions: Whole cow's milk consumption had heterogeneous associations with cardiovascular risk factors. Higher whole cow's milk consumption was associated with lower levels of specific cardiovascular risk factors which might suggest risk factor specific biological pathways with different relations to blood pressure and lipids than glucose. © 2014 Sun et al.

84898770908	Breastfeeding practice, oral contraceptive use and risk of rheumatoid arthritis among chinese women: The guangzhou biobank cohort study	Objective: Hormonal and reproductive factors are implicated in the aetiology of RA, but results of previous studies have been mixed. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationships between RA, use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and history of breastfeeding in a population of older women from South China. Methods: We used baseline data from 7349 women ≥50 years of age in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort. Questionnaires were used to obtain socio-demographic, lifestyle and obstetric history data, including parity, OC use and breastfeeding practices. The main outcome was RA. Women were asked about history of RA and were examined to assess joint swelling. RF levels were measured. The presence of RA was defined in two ways: (i) as reporting physician-diagnosed RA or pain and swelling in at least three joints (including the wrist), and (ii) also having at least one of the following: positive RF, morning stiffness or objective swelling of the small joints of the hands. Results: Compared with those who had never breastfed, breastfeeding was associated with half the risk of RA. The risk was lower with increasing duration of breastfeeding [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.54 (95% CI 0.29, 1.01) for breastfeeding at least 36 months; P for trend = 0.04]. OC use had no relationship with RA. Conclusion: Breastfeeding (especially longer duration) but not OC use is associated with a lower risk of RA. This has potentially important implications for future RA disease burden, given the declining rates of breastfeeding and the one-child policy in China. Further research is needed to explain the biological mechanism. © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology. All rights reserved.

43249086242	An assessment of the quality of randomised controlled trials conducted in China	Background: Despite the rapid increase in research in China, little is known about the quality of clinical trials conducted there. Methods: A systematic review and critical appraisal of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in China and published in 2004 was undertaken to describe their characteristics, assess the quality of their reporting, and where possible, the quality of their conduct. Randomised controlled trials in all disease areas and types of interventions, which took place in China and included Chinese citizens were identified using PubMed and hand searching the Journal Series of the Chinese Medical Association. Quality was assessed against a subset of criteria adapted from the CONSORT statement. Results: Three hundred and seven RCTs were included. One hundred and ninety-nine (64.8%) failed to report methods of randomization and 254 (82.4%) did not mention blinding of either participants or investigators. Reporting of baseline characteristics, primary outcome and length of follow-up was inadequate in a substantial proportion of studies. Fewer than 11% of RCTs mentioned ethical approval and only 18.0% adequately discussed informed consent. However, dropout rates were very favourable with nearly 44% of trials reporting a zero dropout rate. Conclusion: Reporting of RCTs in China requires substantial improvementto meet the targets of the CONSORT statement. The conduct of Chinese RCTs cannot be directly inferred from the standard of reporting; however without good reporting the methods of the trials cannot be clearly ascertained. © 2008 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

46949094025	Are height and leg length universal markers of childhood conditions? The Guangzhou Biobank cohort study	Objective: In developed western populations longer legs have been shown to be a marker of better early childhood conditions. In the first generations to experience the epidemiologic transition and associated economic development, epigenetic constraints on growth might preclude improved childhood conditions from increasing leg growth or height. Design, setting and participants: Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association of parental growth environment, proxied by parental literacy, and childhood conditions, proxied by parental possessions, with leg length, sitting height and height in a cross-sectional sample from 2005-6 of 9998 Chinese people aged at least 50 years from phase 2 of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Main results: Adjusted for age and sex, the association of childhood conditions with leg length and height varied with parental literacy (interaction p values <0.01 and 0.03), but not for sitting height (p value 0.43), with statistically significant trends (p values <0.01) for parental possessions to be associated with longer legs and greater height only in the offspring of two literate parents where legs were longer by 0.56 cm (95% CI 0.27 to 0.86) and height greater by 1.16 cm (95% CI 0.74 to 1.58) for participants with most, compared with least, parental possessions in childhood. Conclusions: Epigenetic influences originating in earlier generations may constrain growth during the infancy and/or childhood phases in very recently developed populations. Neither height nor leg length should be assumed to be consistent proxies of early life environment with corresponding implications for economic history, the aetiology of some chronic diseases and the monitoring of population health.

49449086991	White blood cell count and the metabolic syndrome in older Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Aims: To examine the association between white blood cell count (WBC) and metabolic syndrome (MS) in an older Chinese population. Methods: Three thousand and twenty men and 7256 women aged 50-85 years were recruited and received a medical check-up including measurement of complete blood count, blood pressure, obesity indices, fasting total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and c-reactive protein (CRP). Information on socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was also collected. Results: Vascular risk factors including waist circumference, body mass index, triglyceride, total-, LDL-cholesterol, CRP and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were all positively associated with WBC in both men and women (p from 0.0085 to <0.001). The risk of MS increased significantly with higher total WBC, with adjusted odds ratios (95% confident interval) for second and third tertiles of 1.86 (1.43, 2.42), 2.56 (1.98, 3.32) in men and 1.67 (1.46, 1.90), 2.66 (2.34, 3.03) in women, respectively. Neutrophil and lymphocyte were strongly correlated with total WBC and showed similar association with the MS. Conclusion: There is a strong relationship between total WBC, neutrophil and lymphocyte and the constellation of MS components and associated vascular risk in this older Chinese population. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

53749086422	Are longer legs associated with enhanced fertility in Chinese women?	Female height impacts fertility differently in western and nonwestern cultures. Leg length or relatively longer legs comprise key components of height and possibly indicates mate value. We examined the associations between height, its components, and reproductive outcomes in a large Chinese cohort. Multivariable regression was used to assess the association of height, leg length (standing minus sitting height) and relatively longer legs with number of offspring in a cross-sectional sample of 9998 Chinese people aged at least 50 years from Phase 2 of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study recruited in 2005-2006. Older and less educated respondents had more children. Adjusted for age, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and education, women with longer legs had more offspring; however, there was no such association in men. When stratified by childhood SES (reported parental material possessions), longer legs and relatively longer legs were most strongly associated with more offspring in women from poorer backgrounds. Fertility was specifically associated with longer legs and relatively longer legs in women only. The difference in the association of leg length to number of offspring by childhood SES suggests a preference advantage rather than a physiological advantage in being taller. However, these benefits were specific to reproductive success in women and particularly women from poorer backgrounds suggesting that social factors may have facilitated fertility. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

58549118061	Smoking, smoking cessation and aortic arch calcification in older Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To study the association between smoking, smoking cessation and aortic arc calcification (AAC) in an older Chinese population. Methods: A total of 3022 men and 7279 women aged 50-85 years were recruited and received a medical check-up including measurement of fasting plasma vascular risk factors. Two radiologists reviewed the posterior-anterior plain chest X-ray radiographs and assessed AAC together. Information on smoking status, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was collected. Results: The crude prevalence of AAC in men (38.58%) was lower than that in women (41.37%). The adjusted odds ratios of AAC increased significantly across never, ex- and current smokers in both genders. Dose-response relationships were observed among current smokers for smoking amount (cigarettes/day), smoking duration (years) and cigarette pack-years in both genders (all p < 0.01). The odds ratios decreased significantly (p = 0.018) with longer duration of quitting in light ex-smoking men (<23.5 pack-years) but showed no beneficial effect (p = 0.72) for heavy ex-smokers (≥23.5 pack-years). Conclusion: Smoking increased the risk of AAC in Chinese, while smoking cessation decreased the risk only in male light ex-smokers. Chest X-ray is a cheap and simple method to detect AAC, which should be an important warning signal for immediate smoking cessation. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

60649108599	Smoking, smoking cessation and inflammatory markers in older Chinese men: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Aims: Smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation plays a key role in the process of atherosclerosis. We therefore study the role of smoking and smoking cessation on the levels of inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count, in older Chinese men. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included 2999 men aged 50-85 years who received a medical check-up including measurement of fasting plasma vascular risk factors. Information on smoking status, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors was collected by standardized interview. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, both CRP and WBC increased linearly across never, former and current smokers (both p < 0.01). The odds ratios of elevated CRP and WBC (upper tertiles) were also increased across never, former and current smokers (both p < 0.01). Dose-response relationships were observed among current smokers. Compared to current smokers, the odds ratios of elevated CRP and WBC and means of CRP and WBC declined with longer duration of smoking cessation (all p < 0.01). Conclusions: Smoking is associated with increased CRP and WBC levels, and smoking cessation is associated with the reduction of the increase, confirming the benefits of quitting. Inflammation may be a potential mechanism by which smoking promotes atherosclerotic disease. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

59949084636	Alcohol use and fasting glucose in a developing southern Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: In observational studies, mainly from Western Caucasian populations, moderate alcohol use has been shown to be associated with a lower risk of diabetes. However, whether the protection is due to the attributes of alcohol or to those of moderate alcohol users is difficult to disentangle. A population with a different distribution of alcohol consumption and diabetes prevalence from Western populations was studied as a counterfactual comparison. Methods: Baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phases 1 and 2 (2003-6) were used to examine the adjusted associations, using multivariable censored linear regression, of alcohol use with fasting blood glucose in older (≥50 years) men (n = 5740) and women (n = 14 274) from southern China. Moderate alcohol use was defined as weekly drinking of ≤210 g alcohol in men and ≤140 g in women. The expected associations of alcohol with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and blood pressure were also checked. Results: Moderate alcohol users had very similar fasting glucose levels to never users, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking and physical activity. In contrast, moderate alcohol users had higher HDL-cholesterol by 0.05 mmol/litre (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07). Excessive (more than moderate) alcohol users had higher fasting glucose. Conclusions: In an understudied population with a different pattern of alcohol use from the populations usually studied, the biologically expected effects of moderate alcohol use were seen, but there was little effect on fasting glucose. Although cross-sectional studies cannot be conclusive, this pattern of findings, if confirmed, suggests that moderate alcohol use may not affect fasting glucose, although excessive use may be a risk factor.

60149113038	Pathways to obesity in a developing population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: 'Environmental mismatch' may contribute to obesity in rapidly developing societies, because poor early life conditions could increase the risk of obesity in a subsequently more socio-economically developed environment. In a recently developing population (from southern China) we examined the association of life-course socio-economic position (SEP) with obesity. Methods: In a cross-sectional study of 9998 adults from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phase 2) examined in 2005-06, we used multivariable linear regression to assess the association of SEP at three life stages (proxied by parental possessions, education and longest held occupation) with obesity [body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR)] in men and women. Results: There was no evidence that socio-economic position trajectory had supra-additive effects on BMI or WHR. Instead in women, higher SEP at any life stage usually contributed to lower BMI and WHR; e.g. women with higher early adult SEP had lower BMI [-0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.71 to -0.19) and WHR (-0.02; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.012]. In contrast, in men, higher childhood SEP was associated with higher BMI (0.53; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.88) and WHR (0.01; 95% CI 0.003 to 0.02) as was high late adulthood SEP with BMI (0.36; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.64). Conclusions: This study provides little support for environmental mismatch over the life course increasing obesity in this rapidly transitioning southern Chinese population. However, our findings highlight different effects of the epidemiologic transition in men and women, perhaps with pre-adult exposures as a critical window for sex-specific effects. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved.

67651098901	Childhood growth and adulthood cognition in a rapidly developing population	BACKGROUND: Skeletal growth occurs concurrently with cognitive development. Better childhood conditions, proxied by greater adult height or leg length but not sitting height, have been positively associated with adult cognition mainly in white populations in developed countries. Whether skeletal growth is universally associated with cognitive function is unclear. We examined the association of height and its components with adulthood cognitive function in an area of southern China where there has been rapid economic development. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression was used in a cross-sectional study of 20,411 Chinese men and women aged 50 years or older from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. We assessed the association of height and its components with a test of mild cognitive impairment in which impairment was defined as a score of 3 or less on the 10-word delayed recall test. RESULTS: Greater height and sitting height were associated with better recall in men (odds ratio = 1.15 [95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.32] per 10 cm greater height and 1.33 [1.04-1.69] per 10 cm greater sitting height) and women (1.21 [1.10-1.33] and 1.56 [1.33-1.83], respectively) adjusting for age, education, personal income, and for smoking in men and age of menarche in women. Greater leg length in both sexes was associated with a higher test score. CONCLUSIONS: Certain phases of childhood or adolescent growth may be cognitively protective. If confirmed, these results highlight the childhood and adolescence antecedents of adult disease, with corresponding public health implications for healthy aging. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

70249131801	Alcohol sensitivity, alcohol use and hypertension in an older Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Although the J-shaped association between alcohol consumption and blood pressure (BP) is well known, the effect of alcohol sensitivity on this relationship is less clear. We studied the association of alcohol sensitivity and alcohol use with BP and hypertension. This cross-sectional analysis included 19335 older participants from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study recruited from 2003 to 2006, using clinically measured BP and self-reported alcohol use and alcohol sensitivity. Alcohol use was rare in women, in whom light-to-moderate drinkers (<140 g ethanol per week) without alcohol sensitivity had lower systolic and diastolic BPs (mean difference 5.3 (95% CI 3.8-6.9) mmHg and 1.9 (1.1-2.7) mm Hg, respectively) and a reduced risk of hypertension (0.62 (0.53-0.72)) relative to never drinkers. Similarly, excessive drinkers (≥140g ethanol per week) without alcohol sensitivity had a significantly higher systolic and diastolic BP and risk of hypertension than did nondrinkers (mean difference 5.1 (2.8-7.4) mm Hg, 2.7 (1.5-4.0) mm Hg and 34% (8-66%), respectively, for men). These differences were even greater for men with alcohol sensitivity (mean differences 12.0 (8.9-15.2) mm Hg, 6.2 (4.5-7.9) mmHg and 95% CI (46-159%), respectively). Alcohol sensitivity and alcohol use were both associated with elevated BP and risk of hypertension in an older Chinese population. Alcohol sensitivity may aggravate the effect of drinking on BP. Limiting alcohol use to two drinks per day for men and one drink a day for women may be suitable for East Asians. Reduction of alcohol consumption should be an important public health target.

75149121880	An overview of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-Cardiovascular Disease Subcohort (GBCS-CVD): A platform for multidisciplinary collaboration	The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS, n=30 519, age ≥50 years) was established to examine the effects of genetic and environmental influences on health problems and chronic disease development. Guangzhou is undergoing massive economic development, but from a baseline that had remained unchanged for millennia. The Cardiovascular Disease Subcohort (GBCS-CVD) consists of 2000 participants who have been intensively phenotyped including a range of surrogate markers of vascular disease, including carotid artery intima-media thickness, cerebral artery stenoses, arterial stiffness, ankle-to-brachial blood pressure index and albuminuria, as well as coagulatory and inflammatory markers. Plasma and leukocytes are stored in liquid nitrogen for future studies. Preliminary demographic data show the female volunteers are younger than the male ones, but present with greater levels of adiposity including central obesity (31 vs 16%). Women had more body fat (33 vs 24%) and associated levels of adipokines. Despite this, body mass index and hip circumferences were similar, which contrasts with Caucasian populations. Men had more physician-diagnosed vascular disease (6.1 vs 2.5%), hypertension (42 vs 34%) and hyperglycaemia (36.6 vs 29.6%) than the women, but were less insulin resistant. In men, smoking (40 vs 2%) and drinking alcohol (67 vs 50%) was more common and they also had lower energy expenditures. The genotype distributions of the 15 typed single nucleotide polymorphisms were all in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This article describes the rationale and methodology for the study. Given the comprehensive characterization of demographic and psychosocial determinants and biochemistry, the study provides a unique platform for multidisciplinary collaboration in a highly dynamic setting. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

77649268851	Napping is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Study Objective: Intentional napping is very common, particularly in China. However, there are limited data regarding its potential health effects. We therefore examined the possible relationship between napping and type 2 diabetes. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Setting: Community-based elderly association in Guangzhou, China. Participants: 19,567 Chinese men and women aged 50 years or older. Measurements and Results: Self-reported frequency of napping was obtained by questionnaire and type 2 diabetes was assessed by fasting blood glucose and/or self-reports of physician diagnosis or treatment. Participants reporting frequent naps (4-6 days/week and daily) were 42% to 52% more likely to have diabetes. The relationships remained essentially unchanged after adjustments were made for demographics, lifestyle and sleep habits, health status, adiposity, and metabolic markers (odds ratio for diabetes 1.36 [95% CI 1.17-1.57] in 4-6 days/week, 1.28 [1.15-1.44] in daily nappers). Similar associations were found between napping and impaired fasting glucose. Removal of those with potential ill health and daytime sleepiness did not alter the observed associations. Conclusions: Napping is associated with elevated prevalence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in this older Chinese sample. Our finding suggests that it is less likely that diabetes leads to daytime sleepiness. This raises the possibility that napping may increase the risk of diabetes. Confirmation by longitudinal studies is needed.

76149126470	Airflow obstruction and metabolic syndrome: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	There is some evidence that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and metabolic syndrome may be related, perhaps through systemic inflammation, which is common to both. However, the association between the two conditions has not yet been clearly shown. The present study involved 7,358 adults aged ≥50 yrs from a population-based survey who underwent spirometry, a structured interview and measurement of fasting metabolic marker levels. Airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity ratio of less than the lower limit of normal) was present in 6.7%, and the International Diabetes Federation metabolic syndrome criteria were met by 20.0%. The risk of metabolic syndrome was higher in those with airflow obstruction than in those without (odds ratio (OR) 1.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.92), after controlling for potential confounders. Of the five components of metabolic syndrome, only central obesity was significantly associated with airflow obstruction (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.88) after adjusting for body mass index. A similar association was observed in both never and current smokers. In this Chinese sample, airflow obstruction was associated with metabolic syndrome, and, in particular, its central obesity component. This may help explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in COPD, and so could guide future clinical practice. Copyright©ERS Journals Ltd 2010.

76249122883	Impact of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance on arterial stiffness in an older Chinese population: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-CVD	The aim of the study was to compare the impact of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on vascular function among older Chinese people. A random sample of 671 men and 603 women aged 50 to 85 years without known diabetes from the Guangzhou Biobank Study-CVD was examined in a cross-sectional study. Subjects with no previously confirmed or treated diabetes but with both fasting plasma glucose less than 5.6 mmol/L and 2-hour glucose from 7.8 to less than 11.0 mmol/L were classified as having isolated IGT, and those with no previously confirmed and treated diabetes but with both fasting plasma glucose from 5.6 to less than 7.0 mmol/L and 2-hour glucose less than 7.8 mmol/L were classified as having isolated IFG. A total of 11.0% of the men and 8.6% of the women had isolated IFG, and 17.7% of the men and 18.6% of the women had isolated IGT. The brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and pulse pressure were increased in both the isolated IFG and isolated IGT subjects compared with the normoglycemia group (both Ps < .001). Compared with subjects with isolated IFG, those with isolated IGT appeared to have a higher age- and sex-adjusted brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (1543 ± 22 vs 1566 ± 17, P = .07) and to be more insulin resistant (2-hour postload insulin: 54.2 ± 2.13 vs 26.8 ± 2.99 μU/mL, P < .001), had a worse lipid profile (apolipoprotein [apo] B: 1.07 ± 0.02 vs 0.97 ± 0.02g/L, P < .001; apo B/apo A-1 ratio: 0.80 ± 0.02 vs 0.69 ± 0.02, P < .001), but had lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels (6.03% ± 0.06% vs 5.86% ± 0.04%, P < .001) (values are mean ± SE). Subjects with isolated IGT had greater arterial stiffness, probably as a result of being more insulin resistant, with a worse lipid profile than those with isolated IFG. The sole use of fasting glucose level to identify prediabetic people would fail to identify a significant proportion of the at-risk population. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77949497052	Prior TB, smoking, and airflow obstruction: A cross-sectional analysis of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Prior pulmonary TB has been shown to be associated with a higher risk of airflow obstruction, which is the hallmark of COPD, but whether smoking modifi es this relationship is unclear. We investigated the relationships between prior TB, smoking, and airflow obstruction in a Chinese population sample. Methods: Participants in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study underwent spirometry, chest radiography, and a structured interview on lifestyle and exposures. Prior TB was defi ned as the presence of radiologic evidence suggestive of inactive TB. Airflow obstruction was based on spirometric criteria. Results: The prevalence of prior TB in this sample (N = 8,066, mean age: 61.9 years) was 24.2%. After controlling for sex, age, and smoking exposure, prior TB remained independently associated with an increased risk of airflow obstruction (odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.67). Further adjustment for exposure to passive smoking, biomass fuel, and dust did not alter the relationship. Smoking did not modify the relationship between prior TB and airflow obstruction. Conclusions: Prior TB is an independent risk factor for airflow obstruction, which may partly explain the higher prevalence of COPD in China. Clinicians should be aware of this long-term risk in individuals with prior TB, irrespective of smoking status, particularly in patients from countries with a high TB burden. © 2010 American College of Chest Physicians.

77950344187	Intergenerational 'mismatch' and adiposity in a developing population: The Guangzhou biobank cohort study	Intergenerational 'mismatch' between maternal and adult environments, common in developing economies, has been hypothesized as contributing to obesity. In a rapidly developing population, we examined whether maternal conditions, proxied by maternal literacy, were associated with adult adiposity, proxied by body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) and whether these associations were modified by later life conditions, proxied by socio-economic position (SEP) at three life stages. We also examined if maternal conditions had sex-specific associations with adult adiposity. In a cross-sectional study of 19,957 adults (≥50 years) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3 in 2005-2008), we used multivariable linear regression to assess the association of maternal literacy with BMI and WHR, and whether the associations varied with sex, age or SEP. The adjusted association of maternal literacy with WHR varied with sex. In women, but not men, maternal illiteracy was associated with higher WHR and BMI, adjusted for age; these associations remained, although attenuated, after adjusting for lifestyle, life course SEP and paternal literacy. There was little evidence that associations varied with SEP at any stage, although continuity of poor conditions into early life may have exacerbated the association of maternal illiteracy with higher WHR in women. Poor maternal conditions in developing populations may increase vulnerability to adiposity in women. Whether such sex-specific intergenerational effects are driven by epigenetics, maternal sex hormones or other mechanisms, remains to be determined. However, mismatched maternal and later life conditions do not appear to be associated with adiposity. Our findings, although preliminary, imply that a transient epidemic of obesity may occur in the first generation of women who experience economic development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77952488174	Estimated birth weight and adult cardiovascular risk factors in a developing southern Chinese population: A cross sectional study	Background. Birth weight is negatively associated with cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, but the associations are less well-established in developing populations where birth weight is often unavailable. We studied the association of birth weight and cardiovascular risk, using birth rank as an instrumental variable, in Southern China. Methods. We used published data on birth weight by birth rank from an appropriate population and baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phases 2 & 3 (2005-8) to examine the adjusted associations, using instrumental variable analysis, of birth weight with clinically measured cardiovascular risk factors and the metabolic syndrome in older (≥ 50 years) men (n = 5,051) and women (n = 13,907). Results. Estimated birth weight was associated with lower blood pressure (systolic -0.25 mm Hg 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.53 to 0.03 and diastolic -0.33 mm Hg 95% CI -0.48 to -0.18 per standard deviation higher birth weight), but had little association with glucose, lipids, waist-hip ratio, body mass index or the metabolic syndrome, adjusted for age, sex, early environment and number of offspring. Conclusion. Birth weight may impact blood pressure; however associations of birth weight with other cardiovascular risk factors may not be related to foetal exposures, but speculatively could be an historical co-incidence, with corresponding implications for prevention. © 2010 Schooling et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77954430262	Fluid intake and the risk of bladder cancer: Results from the South and East China case-control study on bladder cancer	Although several studies have assessed the association between total fluid intake, specific drinks and bladder cancer, no firm conclusions can yet be drawn. Four hundred thirty two bladder cancer cases and 392 frequency matched hospital-based controls recruited in the South and East of China between October 2005 and June 2008 were interviewed on their intake of 6 nonalcoholic and 3 alcoholic drinks. Age, sex, smoking and hospital-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated for all drinks and for total fluid intake using logistic regression. For 381 cases (81.9% men) and 371 controls (76.3% men), total fluid intake could be calculated. In men, an increase in total fluid intake was associated with a significantly decreased bladder cancer risk (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99, per cup fluid consumed). Neither green nor black tea consumption was associated with bladder cancer. Daily consumption of milk significantly reduced the risk of bladder cancer by a half (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.32-0.76), which strengthens earlier suggestions that milk is probably associated with a decreased bladder cancer risk. Consumption of wine (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.70) and liquor/spirits (OR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.47-0.92) were associated with a significantly reduced risk. Consumption of water, fruit juice and beer appeared not associated with bladder cancer. There is no clear indication that the risks observed in this Chinese population are substantially different from those observed in Caucasian populations. © 2009 UICC.

77954868505	The Metabolic syndrome is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis independent of insulin resistance: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-CVD	Objective We examined whether the association of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and subclinical atherosclerosis is independent of insulin resistance in a Chinese community sample with no history of type 2 diabetes. Methods Five hundred and ninety-six men and 526 women from a substudy of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS-CVD) had carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT) measured by B-mode ultrasonography, and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) and ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index (ABI) measured simultaneously by a noninvasive automatic waveform analyser. Results Fourteen percentage had MetS as defined by the International Diabetes Federation. Obesity indices, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure, lipids, fasting and postload glucose and insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, glycosylated haemoglobin A1c, leptin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, IMT and PWV increased and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, adiponectin and ABI decreased significantly with increasing number of MetS components after adjusting for age and sex (P for trend from 0·004 to <0·001). After adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and insulin resistance, the odds ratios [OR (95% CI)] of thicker IMT (≥1·0 mm), higher PWV (≥14·0 ms) and low ABI (≤1·0) for MetS were significantly increased [2.28 (1.19-4.38), 2.17 (1.36-3.46) and 1.72 (1.14-2.59), respectively, all P < 0.01] but were lower than the adjusted OR for those with three or more MetS components. Conclusion MetS was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis independent of insulin resistance. The presence of increasing number of MetS risk factors appeared to be more important than the diagnosis of MetS in predicting subclinical atherosclerosis. Early screening for MetS risk factors might identify those at greater cardiovascular risk. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77955553670	Is childhood meat eating associated with better later adulthood cognition in a developing population?	Inadequate childhood nutrition is associated with poor short-term academic and cognitive outcomes. Dietary supplementation with meat is associated with better cognitive outcome in children. Whether childhood nutrition has life long effects on cognitive function is unclear. We examined the association of childhood meat eating with adulthood cognitive function in southern China where the older population lived through significant hardship during their early years. Multivariable linear regression was used in a cross-sectional study of 20,086 Chinese men and women aged iobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3) 2005-8. We assessed the association of childhood meat eating with delayed 10-word and immediate recall score. Adjusted for age, sex, education, childhood and adulthood socio-economic position and current physical activity, childhood meat eating almost daily, when compared to yearly or never childhood meat eating, was positively associated with delayed recall score (additional number of words recalled out of 10 = 0.22 [95% confidence interval = 0.11-0.31]). Similarly adjusted, childhood meat eating about once a month, about once a week and almost daily were positively associated with immediate recall score (additional number of words recalled out of 30 = 0.38 [0.23-0.54], 0.73 [0.56-0.89] and 0.76 [0.55-0.98] respectively). More frequent childhood meat eating was associated with better cognition through to old age. If confirmed, these results highlight the importance of adequate childhood nutrition and they also emphasise the childhood and adolescent antecedents of adult disease, with corresponding public health implications for healthy aging. © 2010 The Author(s).

77957119257	Obesity, high-sensitive C-reactive protein and snoring in older Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: abitual snoring and elevated high-sensitive C-reactive protein (HsCRP) have both been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, snoring and HsCRP are elevated in obese states which may thus be the primary determinant of both. We therefore investigated whether snoring may mediate the increased vascular risk directly through increased inflammation as indicated by HsCRP levels or if other determinants predominated in a large older Chinese population. Methods: A total of 2508 males and 5709 females aged 50-85 years received a medical check-up including measurement of blood pressure, obesity indices, fasting total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and HsCRP. Information on self-reported snoring status was collected by standardized interview. Results: The age-adjusted geometric mean HsCRP concentrations increased significantly with higher snoring frequency in both genders (linear trend, p = 0.02 for men and p < 0.001 for women), but the association was no longer significant after controlling for waist and BMI. Furthermore, HsCRP levels were not significantly associated with snoring frequency groups stratified by BMI/waist quintiles in both genders, except for the 4th waist quintile in men. No interaction was observed between snoring and BMI/waist on HsCRP levels. The multivariate analysis showed that, in both genders, obesity, but not HsCRP, was associated with snoring. Conclusions: Our results showed that snoring frequency did not have an independent effect on inflammation after adjusting for adiposity, and may thus contribute to vascular disease through alternative mechanisms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957284428	Leg length and age of puberty among men and women from a developing population: The guangzhou biobank cohort study	Objectives: Leg length and relative leg length are considered to be reliable markers of prepubertal living conditions. Cessation of leg growth, driven by estrogen, occurs earlier in puberty in girls than boys.We hypothesized that leg length and relative leg length, as sitting height to leg ratio, might have sex-specific associations with age of puberty. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in 10,046 older (≥50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (Phase 3) to examine the associations of recalled age of puberty (women: age of menarche, and men: mean age of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking, and first pubic hair) with subischeal leg length, sitting height to leg ratio, and sitting height. Results: Leg length and sitting height to leg ratio had different associations with age of puberty in men and women (P-values for interaction <0.001), but sitting height did not. Per year earlier puberty, legs were longer among men by 0.09 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01-0.18) and shorter among women by 20.16 cm (95% CI 20.20 to 20.12). Further adjustment for age, hip size (as a marker of buttock fat), and several markers of childhood conditions did not obviate the difference in association by sex. Conclusions: Adult leg length and relative leg length (sitting height to leg ratio) may be biomarkers of different exposures in men and women, with corresponding implications for their interpretation as a biomarker of early life exposures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78149256777	Smoking cessation and carotid atherosclerosis: The guangzhou biobank cohort studydCVD	Introduction Smoking has been shown to be associated with carotid atherosclerosis in cross-sectional and prospective studies in Western populations. However, few studies have examined the reversal of risk resulting from quitting smoking, and the results are conflicting. Methods 959 men aged 50e85 years were randomly selected from phase III (2006e2007) of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study into this cross-sectional study. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCAIMT) was measured by B-mode ultrasonography, and carotid artery plaques were identified. Major cardiovascular risk factors, including fasting triglyceride, low-density and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol and glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure, were assessed. Results CCA-IMT and the number of carotid plaque increased from never to former to current smokers (both p≤0.001). Among former smokers compared to current smokers, after adjustment for cigarette pack-years and other potential confounders, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) for quitting for 1-9, 10-19 and 20+ years were 0.77 (0.47 to 1.26), 0.45 (0.26 to 0.79) and 0.37 (0.17 to 0.77) for the presence of CCA atherosclerosis, and 0.69 (0.43 to 1.12), 0.47 (0.27 to 0.82) and 0.45 (0.23 to 0.96) for the presence of carotid plaques, respectively. Longer duration of quitting smoking was also significantly associated with decreasing risk of the severity of CCA atherosclerosis and carotid plaques (all p≤0.001). Conclusion Smoking cessation was beneficial in attenuating the risk of carotid atherosclerosis associated with cigarette smoking. The short duration of cessation in earlier studies is a likely explanation for the inconsistent results.

78149463269	Does the age of achieving pubertal landmarks predict cognition in older men? Guangzhou biobank cohort study	Purpose: Earlier pubertal maturation in women may be associated with better cognition. It is unclear whether or not this also occurs in men. We tested the hypothesis that earlier pubertal development in men was associated with better cognition in later adulthood in a developing Chinese population. Methods: Multivariable linear regression was used in cross-sectional study of 2463 older, Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Mean pubertal age was calculated as the mean of recalled ages of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking and pubarche. We assessed the association of mean pubertal age with delayed 10-word recall and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores. Results: Adjusted for age and education, 1 year earlier mean pubertal age was associated with higher delayed 10-word recall (0.06 [95% confidence interval = 0.02-0.10]) and higher MMSE (0.08 [0.03-0.13]) scores. Additional adjustment for childhood and adulthood socio-economic position, sitting height, and leg length did not change the results. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest earlier maturation in men is associated with better cognitive function in later adulthood. Whether pubertal timing is a marker of earlier life exposures or reflects a biological relation between somatrophic and/or gonadotrophic hormones and cognitive development is unclear. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78149469034	Moderate alcohol use and cognitive function in the guangzhou biobank cohort study	Purpose: Observational studies in Western settings show moderate alcohol use associated with better cognitive function, but they are vulnerable to contextual bias. Evidence from non-Western settings may be useful to verify causality. We examined such association in southern China where alcohol use is low. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in cross-sectional data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study to assess sex-stratified associations of alcohol use (never, occasional, moderate, heavy and former drinker) with delayed 10-word recall score for all 3 phases (N = 28,537) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in phase 3 (N = 9,571). Results: Delayed 10-word recall scores were higher in moderate drinkers compared with never drinkers among men (0.30 words, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.18 to 0.42) but not women (0.02; 95% CI: -0.12 to 0.17), adjusted for sociodemographic factors. Occasional alcohol users also had higher 10-word recall scores among men (0.27; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37) and women (0.30; 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.37). These estimates were little altered by further adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Results for MMSE scores were similar. Conclusions: Alcohol may not drive the association between moderate use and better cognitive function, which instead may be due to confounding by general moderation in lifestyle. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78649832412	Adolescent Build and Diabetes: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Purpose: With economic development, there is an emerging epidemic of diabetes in China despite relatively low levels of obesity. Muscle mass, for which adolescence is a key developmental window, may reduce vulnerability to diabetes. We examined the association of recalled adolescent build with diabetes in a large sample from the developing country setting of southern China. Methods: We used multivariable regression in cross-sectional data (2005-2008), from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3) for 19,524 older (≥50 years) Chinese to examine the adjusted associations of recalled adolescent relative weight (light [. n = 6843], average [. n = 9529], and heavy [. n = 3152]) with clinically measured diabetes. Results: As older adults, heavy adolescents had a lower risk of diabetes (odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.75-0.99) than light adolescents adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, leg length, and seated height. This association was stronger after additional adjustment for waist/hip ratio and body mass index. Conclusions: Poor living conditions during adolescence, resulting in low muscle mass, could contribute to vulnerability to diabetes, which, if confirmed, could be relevant to the emerging epidemic of diabetes in the developing world, as well as to minorities and migrants elsewhere. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

78649835887	Size Does Matter: Adolescent Build and Male Reproductive Success in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Purpose: Women usually report attributes of masculinity as attractive. These are attributes are metabolically expensive. We examined the trade off of a key attribute of masculinity, muscularity, proxied by recalled adolescence build, with lifetime reproductive success in the developing country setting of Southern China. Methods: We used poisson multivariable regression in 19,168 older (≥50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3) to examine the sex-stratified, adjusted associations of recalled adolescent relative weight (light (n = 6730), average (n = 9344), and heavy (n = 3094)) with number of offspring. Results: Among men, recalled heavy adolescent weight compared with light was associated with an incident rate ratio for offspring of 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.13) adjusted for age. This estimate was unchanged by adjustment for life course socio-economic position. There was no such association in women. Conclusions: Male physical attractiveness, possibly representing levels of testosterone, was rewarded by lifetime reproductive success, despite potential costs. Socio-economic development may facilitate an inevitable move toward environmentally driven higher levels of testosterone with corresponding public health implications for any conditions or societal attributes driven by testosterone. Further investigation is warranted. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

78651528078	Aortic arch calcification and vascular disease: The guangzhou biobank cohort study	Objective: To examine the association between aortic arch calcification (AAC) and vascular disease in an older Chinese sample. Methods: For this study, 30,203 Chinese aged 50-85 years were recruited with baseline information on socioeconomic position, lifestyle and vascular risk factors. The presence and severity of AAC were diagnosed independently from chest X-ray by two radiologists. Results: The age-adjusted prevalence of AAC was significantly higher in women than men [34.6% (95% CI 33.9-35.3) vs. 27.9% (95% CI 26.8-28.8), p < 0.001]. Severity of AAC was significantly associated with physician-diagnosed ischemic heart disease (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.35-1.79) and combined vascular disease (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.30-1.69) after adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Increasing severity of AAC was associated with increased risk for ischemic heart disease and vascular disease (p for trend = 0.02 to <0.001). No association between AAC and stroke was found. Conclusions: AAC was strongly and independently associated with vascular disease, suggesting that assessment of AAC from chest X-ray, which is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive, can provide useful information for risk stratification of vascular disease, and should be routinely incorporated in chest X-ray examination.

78751469504	Replication study of SNP associations for colorectal cancer in Hong Kong Chinese	Background: Recent genome-wide association studies of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping to 10 independent loci that confer modest increased risk. These studies have been conducted in European populations and it is unclear whether these observations generalise to populations with different ethnicities and rates of CRC. Methods: An association study was performed on 892 CRC cases and 890 controls recruited from the Hong Kong Chinese population, genotyping 32 SNPs, which were either associated with CRC in previous studies or are in close proximity to previously reported risk SNPs. Results: Twelve of the SNPs showed evidence of an association. The strongest associations were provided by rs10795668 on 10p14, rs4779584 on 15q14 and rs12953717 on 18q21.2. There was significant linear association between CRC risk and the number of independent risk variants possessed by an individual (P2.29 × 10 5). Conclusion: These results indicate that some previously reported SNP associations also impact on CRC risk in the Chinese population. Possible reasons for failure of replication for some loci include inadequate study power, differences in allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium structure or effect size between populations. Our results suggest that many associations for CRC are likely to generalise across populations. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.

79951682810	Arterial stiffness and left-ventricular diastolic dysfunction: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-CVD	Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, is an established cardiovascular risk factor of ventricular stiffening. We studied the association of baPWV with left-ventricular (LV) diastolic function in a sub-study of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. In all, 378 Chinese subjects with a normal ejection fraction (50%) had baPWV measurement by a noninvasive automatic waveform analyser, carotid intima-medial thickness (IMT) measurement by B-mode ultrasonography and cardiac diastolic function assessment by echocardiography. After adjusting for age, both baPWV and IMT were associated with LV mass index, posterior wall end-diastolic thickness and inter-ventricular end-diastolic thickness, but only baPWV was associated with deceleration time, atrial flow velocity and E/A ratio. Multivariable linear regression model showed that baPWV and mean arterial pressure, but not IMT, were significantly associated with E/A ratio (Β=-0.02, P=0.03 and Β=-0.36, P=0.02, respectively). The receiver operator characteristic curve showed that baPWV was better than pulse pressure or mean arterial pressure to detect LV diastolic dysfunction (E/A<1.0). Our study suggested that increased baPWV might be an independent risk factor or marker for diastolic dysfunction. Early detection of an intervention on increased baPWV may be important for prevention of cardiac diastolic dysfunction. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

79951700299	Physical activity, adiposity, and diabetes risk in middle-aged and older Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank cohort study	OBJECTIVE- Physical activity may modify the association of adiposity with type 2 diabetes. We investigated the independent and joint association of adiposity and physical activity with fasting plasma glucose, impaired fasting glucose, and type 2 diabetes in a Chinese population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS- Middle-aged and older Chinese (n = 28,946, ≥50 years, 72.4%women) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study were examined in 2003-2008. Multivariable regression was used in a cross-sectional analysis. RESULTS- BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were positively associated with type 2 diabetes after multiple adjustment, most strongly for WHR with odds ratio (OR) of 3.99 (95% CI 3.60-4.42) for highest compared with lowest tertile. Lack of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, but not walking, was associated with diabetes with an OR of 1.29 (1.17-1.41). The association of moderate-to-vigorous activity with fasting glucose varied with WHR tertiles (P=0.01 for interaction). Within the highWHRtertile, participants who had a lack of moderate-to-vigorous activity had an OR of 3.87 (3.22-4.65) for diabetes, whereas those who were active had an OR of 2.94 (2.41-3.59). CONCLUSIONS- In this population, WHR was a better measure of adiposity-related diabetes risk than BMI or waist circumference. Higher moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with lower diabetes risk, especially in abdominally obese individuals. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.

79952129154	Independent and combined associations of abdominal obesity and seated resting heart rate with type 2 diabetes among older Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Central obesity and poor physical fitness predict the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular mortality among Caucasian populations. We studied the independent and combined effect of abdominal obesity and seated resting heart rate used as an indicator of physical fitness, on the presence of type 2 diabetes among 30 519 older residents of Guangzhou, Southern China. Methods: Participants were stratified into four groups, based on the Asian criteria for abdominal obesity (≥90/≥ 80 cm in men/women) and the 75% cut-off point for seated resting heart rate (≥83 beats per min). The association with type 2 diabetes was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: A total of 3777 (12.7%) volunteers were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which was independently associated with seated resting heart rate and, in particular, increasing levels of abdominal obesity (p < 0.001). An odds ratio of 3.93 (95% confidence interval = 3.48-4.43) was identified for type 2 diabetes in participants who were obese with a seated resting heart rate ≥ 83 beats per min after adjusting for potential confounders. +Conclusions: Higher seated resting heart rate, a marker of poor physical fitness, independently doubles the risk of type 2 diabetes. The strength of this association is further increased when abdominal obesity is considered. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

79952437473	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and HbA1c defined prediabetes: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study-CVD	Objective To examine the association between plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and diabetes status. Research Design and Methods One thousand three hundred and ninety-three older Chinese were randomly selected from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Diabetes status was classified as impaired HbA1c (IA1c) level of 5·7-6·4%, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes using the American Diabetes Association diagnosis criteria in 2010. Results Compared to the normoglycemic (NG) group, 421 subjects with IA1c, but without diabetes, IFG or IGT, had adverse levels of vascular risk factors, including PAI-1, lipid profile, blood pressure and anthropometry. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, compared to the NG group, the level of plasma PAI-1 was independently and significantly increased in the IA1c and the IFG/IGT group (mean difference: 32·0 (95% confidence interval: 5·5-58·6) ng/ml and 33·3 (6·3-60·3) ng/ml, respectively; P < 0·01). Conclusions Plasma PAI-1 level was increased in people with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 5·7-6·4% but without IFG or IGT, and in people with IFG/IGT, suggesting an increased risk for future diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in these groups. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

79952897782	Atrial fibrillation and obesity among older Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common form of arrhythmia, and its prevalence is increasing. Few studies have examined its association with obesity as defined by different criteria, particularly in developing countries. We investigated the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and obesity indices among older Chinese. Methods: We conducted a community-based nested case control study using cross-sectional data of 5882 men and 14,548 women aged 50 or above from Phases I and II (September 2003 to May 2006) of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). AF cases were identified by the 12-lead body surface electrocardiogram. Results: 159 AF cases (65 men and 94 women) were identified from 19,964 participants with ECG records. 9249 participants with other abnormal ECG findings were excluded, resulting in a case control comparison on 159 AF cases and 10,369 controls.

79953249460	Passive smoking and aortic arch calcification in older Chinese never smokers: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To study whether passive smoking is a risk factor for aortic arch calcification (AAC) among never smokers. Background: We have previously reported that active smoking increases the risk of AAC, but the effect of passive smoking has not been reported. Methods: We used baseline data of the Phase 1 Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). 7702 older Chinese never smokers from the Phase 1 GBCS were included. Information on passive smoking and potential confounders were collected by standardized interviews and laboratory assays. AAC was diagnosed from chest X-ray by two experienced radiologists. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios of AAC for passive smoking with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: In women, the risk for aortic arch calcification (AAC) increased significantly with increasing duration of adulthood passive smoking exposure at home, at work and total duration of adulthood home and work exposure [adjusted odds ratio 1.24 (95% confidence interval 1.09-1.41) for high level of total exposure] (P for trend from 0.012 to 0.001). For passive smoking at home, at work and total exposure, significant trends of increasing severity of AAC with increasing duration of exposure were observed in men and women combined (P for trend from 0.05 to 0.002). Conclusion: Passive smoking is a risk factor for aortic arch calcification. Studies of passive smoking and AAC, especially in developing countries can generate important local evidence to raise awareness and to support public health measures to protect non-smokers from second-hand smoke. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79955555744	Short or long sleep duration is associated with memory impairment in older chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Study Objectives: To examine the association between sleep-related factors and memory impairment. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Community-based study in Guangzhou, China. Participants: 28,670 older Chinese (20,776 women and 7,894 men) aged 50 to 85 years. Measurements and Results: Demographic and socioeconomic data, sleep-related factors, and cognitive function were collected by face-to-face interview. Potential confounders, such as employment and occupational status, smoking, alcohol and tea use, physical activity, self-rated health, anthropometry, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose and lipids were measured. After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, an inverted U-shaped association between sleep duration and delayed word recall test (DWRT) score, a validated measure of memory impairment, was found, with 7 to 8 h of habitual sleep duration showing the highest score (P-values for trend from 3 to 7 h and from 7 to ≥ 10 h were all ≤ 0.001). Compared to sleep duration of 7 h, the adjusted odds ratio for memory impairment from the sleep duration of 3 to 4 or ≥ 10 h was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.07-1.56) and 1.52 (1.25-1.86), respectively. Subjects with daily napping, morning tiredness, or insomnia had significantly lower DWRT scores than those without (P ranged from < 0.001 to 0.01).Conclusions: Short or long sleep duration was an important sleep-related factor independently associated with memory impairment and may be a useful marker for increased risk of cognitive impairment in older people. © Copyright 2011 Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC.

79956016806	Childhood meat eating and inflammatory markers: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: We hypothesized that socio-economic development could, via nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex-steroids, promote a pro-inflammatory state among men but not women in developing countries. We tested this hypothesis, using recalled childhood meat eating as a proxy for childhood nutrition, in southern China. Methods. We used multivariable linear regression in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phase 3 (2006-8) to examine the adjusted associations of recalled childhood meat eating, <1/week (n = 5,023), about once per week (n = 3,592) and almost daily (n = 1,252), with white blood cell count and its differentials among older (50 years) men (n = 2,498) and women (n = 7,369). Results: Adjusted for age, childhood socio-economic position, education and smoking, childhood meat eating had sex-specific associations with white blood cell count and lymphocyte count, but not granulocyte count. Men with childhood meat eating almost daily compared to <1/week had higher white blood cell count (0.33 10

79956119106	Parental death during childhood and adult cardiovascular risk in a developing country: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort study	Background: In observational studies from western countries childhood emotional adversity is usually associated with adult cardiovascular disease. These findings are open to contextual biases making evidence from other settings valuable. We examined the association of a potential marker of childhood emotional adversity with cardiovascular disease risk factors in a developing country. Methods: We used multivariable regression in cross-sectional analysis of older (≥50 years) men (n = 7,885) and women (n = 20,886) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-8) to examine the adjusted association of early life (<18 years) parental death (none, one or two deaths) with blood pressure, fasting glucose, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and white blood cell count (WBC). We used seated height and delayed 10-word recall to assess content validity of parental death as a measure of childhood emotional adversity. We also examined whether associations varied by sex. Results: Early life parental death was associated with shorter age- and sex-adjusted seated height. It was also associated with lower 10-word recall score adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic position, leg length and lifestyle. Similarly, adjusted early life parental death was not associated with blood pressure, fasting glucose, LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol but was associated with lower BMI (-0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.62 to -0.19 for 2 compared with no early life parental deaths) and triglycerides. Associations varied by sex for WHR and WBC. Among men only, early life parental death was associated with lower WHR (-0.008, 95% CI -0.015 to -0.001) and WBC (-0.35 10

79956226964	Does childhood meat eating contribute to sex differences in risk factors for ischaemic heart disease in a developing population?	Background: A male epidemic of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) emerges with economic development. It has previously been hypothesised that this epidemic is due to nutritionally driven levels of pubertal sex steroids, which lead to a more atherogenic body shape and lipid profile in boys but not girls, without any sex-specific effects on glucose metabolism. This study tests this hypothesis by examining the association of childhood meat eating with IHD risk in a developing Chinese population. Methods: Multivariable linear and censored regression was used in a cross-sectional study of 19 418 Chinese older ($50 years) men and women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3) to assess the adjusted associations of childhood meat eating with waist to hip ratio (WHR), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose. Results: Adjusted for age, childhood hunger, life-course socioeconomic position and current lifestyle childhood almost daily meat eating compared with less than weekly meat eating was associated with higher WHR (0.007, 95% CI 0.0003 to 0.01) in men but not women. No association with fasting glucose was observed. Conclusions: Given the potential limitations of this study, especially the crude nature of the exposure and modest findings, the results should be considered as preliminary. However, they do lend support to the hypothesis that the male epidemic of premature IHD and sexual divergence in IHD rates that occur with economic development may be nutritionally driven in childhood. In elucidating the developmental origins of noncommunicable chronic diseases, more attention should be focused on the sociohistorical context and the role of puberty.

79956333348	Life long endogenous estrogen exposure and later adulthood cognitive function in a population of naturally postmenopausal women from Southern China: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Estrogen has neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in animal and in vitro studies. Epidemiological studies are inconclusive, but suggest a positive association between endogenous estrogen exposure (measured by reproductive period, the number of years between menarche and menopause) and later life cognitive function. Methods: Structural equation modeling was used in a cross-sectional study of 11,094 naturally postmenopausal multiparous Chinese older (≥50 years) women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3) to assess the interrelationship of four proxies of higher endogenous estrogen exposure (longer reproductive period, older age of first pregnancy, lower parity and shorter average duration of breast feeding per child) with immediate and the delayed 10-word recall score in phases 2 and 3, and with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score in phase 3 (5641 women). Results: Adjusted for age, education, childhood and adulthood socio-economic position and physical activity, longer reproductive period was associated with higher scores (0.02 words per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.008-0.02 for delayed recall and 0.05 MMSE score, 95%CI 0.04-0.07, respectively). Lower parity and shorter average duration of breast-feeding per child were also associated with better cognitive function. Conclusions: In a large cohort of naturally postmenopausal Chinese women proxies of greater endogenous estrogen exposure were associated with better cognitive function. These findings support biological evidence for a cognitively protective role of endogenous estrogen. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79958708013	Socioeconomic influences at different life stages on health in Guangzhou, China	In long-term developed countries socioeconomic position across the life course is positively associated with health. We examined these associations in a developing country with a history of efforts to reorganize the social hierarchy. Taking a life course perspective, we used multi-variable logistic regression to assess the association of socioeconomic disadvantage at four life stages (measured by parental possessions, education, longest-held occupation and current household income) with self-rated health, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and metabolic syndrome in 20,086 Chinese adults aged ≥50 years from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2005-2008). Model comparisons were used to determine whether the number of exposures to disadvantage (accumulation of risk) was more important than the life stage of exposure (critical periods).Socioeconomic disadvantage across the life course was associated with poor self-rated health, COPD and, in women only, with metabolic syndrome. Adjusting for adult health-related behavior (smoking, alcohol use and physical exercise) altered these associations very little. Associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and health in this Southern Chinese population were broadly similar to those found in Western countries in terms of the accumulation of disadvantage across the life course. However, longest-held occupation was not independently associated with adult health and socioeconomic disadvantage was not associated with metabolic syndrome in men. This suggests that the mechanisms linking socioeconomic position to health in China may be different from those in Western populations and may require context-specific policy interventions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

80053562297	Dose-Response Relation Between Physical Activity and Cognitive Function: Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Purpose: To examine, via cross-sectional analysis, the dose-response association between physical activity and cognitive function in Chinese subjects. Methods: A total of 27,651 participants aged 50 to 85 years were recruited from 2003 to 2008. Information on potential confounders, including demographic and anthropometric characteristics, socioeconomic position, lifestyle, and disease history, was collected by standardized interview and procedures. Cognitive function was assessed by the delayed 10-word recall test (DWRT). Results: When the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used, we found that most of the participants were classified as physically active (53.1%), with 42.4% moderately active and 4.5% physically inactive. Significant dose-response relations across quintiles of metabolic equivalent value (METs) with DWRT score in participants with or without good self-rated health were found (all p for trend <.001). In participants with poor self-rated heath, compared with the first quintile of METs, those in the fifth quintile (highest METs) had a significantly reduced risk for mild cognitive impairment by 28% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.89, p < .01; p for trend = .006). After additional adjustment for depression, we found that the association between physical activity and DWRT score remained significant. Conclusions: A significant dose-response relationship between physical activity and cognitive function was found, and the association was more pronounced in participants with poor self-rated health. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

80053930569	Intergenerational influences on diabetes in a developing population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objectives:: Intergenerational "mismatch" and/or growth conditions may be relevant to the epidemic of diabetes in developing populations. In a rapidly developing southern Chinese population, we tested whether maternal environment, proxied by maternal literacy, or family socio-economic position (SEP), proxied by paternal literacy, were associated with fasting glucose and diabetes. To assess if intergenerational mismatch contributed, we tested whether the associations varied by life course SEP. Methods:: In 19,818 older (≥50 years) adults from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (phases 2 and 3), we used censored and logistic regression to assess the associations of maternal and paternal literacy with fasting glucose, elevated fasting glucose and diabetes and whether these associations varied by sex, age or life course SEP. Results:: Maternal, but not paternal, literacy was negatively associated with fasting plasma glucose (β-coefficient -0.06 mmol/l, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to -0.01) and elevated fasting glucose (odds ratio (OR) 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99) adjusted for age, sex, study phase, life course SEP, childhood growth, adiposity, number of offspring, and birth order. Associations of maternal and paternal literacy with fasting glucose, elevated fasting glucose and diabetes did not vary by sex, age or life course SEP. Conclusion:: Offspring of literate mothers had lower risk for impaired glucose tolerance than offspring of illiterate mothers. Being raised by literate mothers may increase the likelihood of children with higher SEP and lower long-term disease risk, or better maternal conditions over generations may be associated with lower fasting glucose. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

DESIGN: Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials with data extraction and quality assessment performed independently by two researchers. DATA SOURCES PUBMED:, CINAHL, and Google Scholar from the earliest possible year to September 2011. References from meta-analyses and reviews. STUDY: selection Randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of physical activity in adults who had completed their main cancer treatment, except hormonal treatment. RESULTS: There were 34 randomised controlled trials, of which 22 (65%) focused on patients with breast cancer, and 48 outcomes in our meta-analysis. Twenty two studies assessed aerobic exercise, and four also included resistance or strength training. The median duration of physical activity was 13 weeks (range 3-60 weeks). Most control groups were considered sedentary or were assigned no exercise. Based on studies on patients with breast cancer, physical activity was associated with improvements in insulin-like growth factor-I, bench press, leg press, fatigue, depression, and quality of life. When we combined studies on different types of cancer, we found significant improvements in body mass index (BMI), body weight, peak oxygen consumption, peak power output, distance walked in six minutes, right handgrip strength, and quality of life. Sources of study heterogeneity included age, study quality, study size, and type and duration of physical activity. Publication bias did not alter our conclusions.CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity has positive effects on physiology, body composition, physical functions, psychological outcomes, and quality of life in patients after treatment for breast cancer. When patients with cancer other than breast cancer were also included, physical activity was associated with reduced BMI and body weight, increased peak oxygen consumption and peak power output, and improved quality of life.

84859207843	Life-course origins of social inequalities in adult immune cell markers of inflammation in a developing southern Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Socioeconomic position (SEP) throughout life is associated with cardiovascular disease, though the mechanisms linking these two are unclear. It is also unclear whether there are critical periods in the life course when exposure to better socioeconomic conditions confers advantages or whether SEP exposures accumulate across the whole life course. Inflammation may be a mechanism linking socioeconomic position (SEP) with cardiovascular disease. In a large sample of older residents of Guangzhou, in southern China, we examined the association of life course SEP with inflammation. Methods. In baseline data on 9,981 adults ( 50 years old) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2006-08), we used multivariable linear regression and model fit to assess the associations of life course SEP at four stages (childhood, early adult, late adult and current) with white blood, granulocyte and lymphocyte cell counts. Results: A model including SEP at all four life stages best explained the association of life course SEP with white blood and granulocyte cell count for men and women, with early adult SEP (education) making the largest contribution. A critical period model best explained the association of life course SEP with lymphocyte count, with sex-specific associations. Early adult SEP was negatively associated with lymphocytes for women. Conclusions: Low SEP throughout life may negatively impact late adult immune-inflammatory status. However, some aspects of immune-inflammatory status may be sensitive to earlier exposures, with sex-specific associations. The findings were compatible with the hypothesis that in a developing population, upregulation of the gonadotropic axis with economic development may obscure the normally protective effects of social advantage for men. © 2012 West et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84860623350	Effect of carotid atherosclerosis on mild cognitive impairment	Objective: To examine the effect of carotid atherosclerosis on mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: 1886 relatively healthy Guangzhou residents without history of stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary heart disease and malignant tumor were recruited in this study by simple random selection. MCI and carotid color ultrasound were measured in these subjects by using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), the 10-word list learning task (CWL) and common carotid artery intima-medial thickness (IMT) as indicators. Results: (1) The 300 (15.9%) subjects with MCI were identified. No significant difference in MCI prevalence between the sexes was identified. (2) Significant associations between CWL and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as older age, smoking and increased waist circumference, blood pressure and lipids were found. (3) After adjusting for multiple potential confounders, increasing IMT was significantly associated with both decreased CWL (β=-1.05, 95% CI: -1.73 - -0.36) and MMSE score (β=-0.95, 95% CI: -1.67--0.23). (4) After adjusting for age, sex, education, physical activity, smoking, waist circumference and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, IMT was significantly thicker in the MCI group than the normal (0.76 mm vs 0.74 mm, F=6.9, P < 0.01). Conclusions: The severity of MCI was significantly and linearly associated with increased IMT, suggesting that preventing atherosclerosis may help to reduce the incidence and development of dementia.

84860801434	Self-reported long total sleep duration is associated with metabolic syndrome: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	OBJECTIVE - To examine the association between total sleep duration and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) in older Chinese. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) was performed. Participants (n = 29,333) were aged ≥50 years. Risk of MetSyn and its components were identified for self-reported total sleep duration. RESULTS - Participants reporting long (≥9 h) and short (<6 h) total sleep duration had increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.18 (95% CI 1.07-1.30) and 1.14 (1.05-1.24) for the presence of MetSyn, respectively. The relationship remained in long sleepers (OR 1.21 [1.10-1.34]) but diminished in short sleepers (0.97 [0.88-1.06]) after full adjustment. CONCLUSIONS - Long sleep duration was associated with greater risk of MetSyn in older Chinese. Confirmation through longitudinal studies is needed. The mechanisms mediating the link between long sleep duration and MetSyn require further investigation. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.

84861360012	Evaluation of moderate alcohol use and cognitive function among men using a mendelian randomization design in the guangzhou biobank cohort study	Observational studies usually show that moderate alcohol use is associated with better cognitive function. Such studies are vulnerable to residual confounding arising from systematic differences between moderate alcohol users and others. A Mendelian randomization study carried out in a suitable population, such as southern Chinese men, in which alcohol use is low to moderate and is influenced by genotype, offers an alternative and superior approach for clarifying the causal effect of moderate alcohol use on cognitive function. The authors used aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genotype (AA, GA, or GG) as an instrumental variable in 2-stage least squares analysis to obtain unbiased estimates of the relation of alcohol consumption (measured in alcohol units (10 g ethanol) per day) with cognitive function, assessed from delayed 10-word recall score (n = 4,707) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (n = 2,284), among men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008). ALHD2 genotype was strongly associated with alcohol consumption, with an F statistic of 71.0 in 2-stage least squares analysis. Alcohol consumption was not associated with delayed 10-word recall score (-0.03 words per alcohol unit, 95% confidence interval:-0.18, 0.13) or MMSE score (0.06 points per alcohol unit, 95% confidence interval:-0.22, 0.34). Moderate alcohol use is unlikely to be cognitively protective. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

84862910469	Hyperglycaemia and vitamin D: A systematic overview	Vitamin D plays a role in a range of functions that may impact on glycaemic control. In this study we systematically report on clinical studies evaluating the impact of vitamin D on aspects of hyperglycaemia in non-pregnant adults. A total of 1,294 articles, of which 417 were reviews, were identified. No well-designed randomised, controlled trials were identified that specifically investigated the effects of vitamin D supplementation on glucose and insulin concentrations. The majority of the studies that are available were poorly designed, having limited numbers, short study duration, or were conducted in volunteers with normal baseline, as measured by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), concentrations or used inadequate doses of the supplements to normalise vitamin D concentrations, or used inappropriate analyses. Most studies did not observe improvements in glycaemia, with few exceptions. The results were more equivocal for aspects of insulin resistance. Most found no benefit on measures of insulin resistance, although some did. However, more studies described improved insulin release, although data from the studies to date are really inadequate to provide any reliable conclusions. Well-conducted randomised, controlled trials with adequate vitamin D doses are required to effectively assess whether this vitamin can reduce the incidence of diabetes. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

84863865986	White blood cell subsets are associated with carotid intima-media thickness and pulse wave velocity in an older Chinese population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Cross-sectional associations between white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte and granulocyte numbers, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) were examined in a novel older Chinese community sample. A total of 817 men and 760 women from a sub-study of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study had a full blood count measured by an automated hematology analyzer, carotid IMT by B-mode ultrasonography and brachial-ankle PWV by a non-invasive automatic waveform analyzer. Following adjustment for confounders, WBC count (β=0.07, P<0.001) and granulocyte (β=0.07, P<0.001) number were significantly positively related to PWV, but not lymphocyte number. Similarly, WBC count (β=0.08, P=0.03), lymphocyte (β=0.08, P=0.002) and granulocyte (β=0.03, P=0.04) number were significantly positively associated with carotid IMT, but only the association with lymphocyte count survived correction for other cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, higher WBC, particularly lymphocyte and granulocyte, count could be used, respectively, as markers of cardiovascular disease risk, measured through indicators of atherosclerosis and arterial stiffness. The associations for WBC count previously observed by others were likely driven by higher granulocytes; an index of systemic inflammation. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84865202412	Past dust and GAS/FUME exposure and COPD in Chinese: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	The impact of occupational dust and gas/fume exposure on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in developing countries has not been quantified. We examined the relationship between past dust and fume exposure and prevalence of COPD and respiratory symptoms in a cross-sectional analysis of a large Chinese population sample. Participants in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (n = 8216; 27.3% men, mean age 61.9 ± 6.8 years) had spirometry and a structured interview including exposures, symptoms, and lifestyle. Self-reported intensity and duration of dust and gas/fume exposure was used to derive cumulative exposure. COPD was diagnosed from spirometry using lower limit of normal based on prediction equations. COPD was associated with high exposure to dust or gas/fume (exposed: 87/1206 v non-exposed: 191/3853; adjusted odds ratio: 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 1.87) with no evidence of effect modification by smoking. Respiratory symptoms were associated with exposures to dust and gas/fume, with adjusted odds ratios for chronic cough/phlegm of 1.57 (1.13, 2.17) and 1.39 (1.20, 1.60) for dyspnoea. The overall population attributable fraction for COPD due to occupational exposure was 10.4% (95% CI -0.9%, 19.5%). Occupational dust and gas/fume exposure is associated with an increased prevalence of COPD in this Chinese sample, independent of smoking. The population attributable fraction in Chinese is similar to that in Western populations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84872278245	COPD and depressive symptoms: Findings from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) co-exists with depression, but important questions remain about the determinants of this association. Purpose: We examined the association of depressive symptoms with three aspects of COPD: self-reports of physician-diagnosed COPD, chronic respiratory symptoms, and airway obstruction. Methods: We used data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (n = 7,995). Airway obstruction was assessed by spirometry. A score ≥4 on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used as a cutoff for depressive symptoms. Results: Self-reported COPD was positively associated with depressive symptoms but airway obstruction was not. Compared to those free of both respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction those reporting respiratory symptoms were more likely to have depressive symptoms regardless of whether they had obstruction or not. Conclusions: In this Chinese population, a self-reported physician diagnosis of COPD and symptom perception, but not airway obstruction, appeared as main determinants of depressive symptoms. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2012.

84875594574	Is aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 a credible genetic instrument for alcohol use in mendelian randomization analysis in southern Chinese men?	Background Mendelian randomization studies provide a means of assessing causal relations without interventions, but require valid genetic instruments. We assessed the credibility of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) as a genetic instrument for alcohol use in Southern Chinese men. Methods We genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism rs671 of ALDH2 in 4867 men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. We used linear regression to assess the strength of the association of ALDH2 variants with alcohol use, whether ALDH2 variants were independently associated with socio-economic position or other potential confounders and whether associations of ALDH2 variants with cardiovascular risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDLand LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose), triglycerides, body mass index, self reported cardiovascular disease, self-reported ischaemic heart disease, cognitive function (delayed 10-word recall and Mini Mental State Examination score) and liver function (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) were fully mediated by alcohol use. Results The minor allele frequency (A) of ALDH2 was 0.29. The F statistic for ALDH2 variants was 75.0, suggesting that substantial weak instrument bias is unlikely. ALDH2 variants were not associated with socio-economic position, smoking or physical activity. ALDH2 variants were only associated with diastolic blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol, but these genetic associations with blood pressure and HDL-cholesterol were attenuated after adjusting for alcohol use, suggesting the apparent genetic associations were possibly mediated by alcohol use. Conclusions ALDH2 variants are a credible genetic instrument for Mendelian randomization studies of alcohol use and many attributes of health in Southern Chinese men.© The Author 2012; all rights reserved.

84877925397	Mental health and asthma in China: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: There is consistent evidence of the co-occurrence of poor mental health and asthma in Western populations. Since the experience and expression of mental health is partly culturally determined, it is of interest to examine if similar associations are found in other cultural settings. In that regard, very little is known about the association between mental health and asthma in Asian countries, such as China. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between mental health and asthma in a large sample from China. Method: We used data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phase 3 (n = 9,280). Participants reported physician-diagnosed asthma. Mental health measures included the 15-item Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-C) and the SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) score. We compared the prevalence of asthma by GDS-C and MCS scores by estimating prevalence ratios (PRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), using Poisson regression. Results: Compared to those without depression, the prevalence of asthma was higher in those with moderate or severe depression levels (PR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.58-4.40 and PR = 4.43, 95% CI = 1.62-12.09, p for trend ≤0.0001). The prevalence of asthma increased by 46% with every 1 standard deviation increase of the GDS-C score (PR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.24-1.73). The MCS score was not associated with asthma. Conclusion: Depressive symptoms were associated with asthma prevalence in a Chinese population. Further research into the mechanism and potential directions of causality is warranted. © 2012 International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

84879241969	Influence of heart rate at rest for predicting the metabolic syndrome in older Chinese adults	The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between seated resting heart rate and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) among older residents of Guangzhou, South China. A total of 30,519 older participants (≥50 years) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study were stratified into quartiles based on seated resting heart rate. The associations between each quartile and the MetS were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. A total of 6,907 (22.8 %) individuals were diagnosed as having the MetS, which was significantly associated with increasing heart rate quartiles (P < 0.001). Participants in the uppermost quartile (mean resting heart rate 91 ± 8 beats/min) of this cardiovascular proxy had an almost twofold increased adjusted risk (odds ratio (95 % CI) = 1.94 (1.79, 2.11), P < 0.001) for the MetS, as compared to those in the lowest quartile (mean resting heart rate, 63 ± 4 beats/min). Heart rate, which is an inexpensive and simple clinical measure, was independently associated with the MetS in older Chinese adults. We hope these observations will spur further studies to examine the usefulness of resting heart rate as a means of risk stratification in such populations, for which targeted interventions should be implemented. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84880456406	Moderate Alcohol Use and Cardiovascular Disease from Mendelian Randomization	Background:Observational studies show moderate alcohol use negatively associated with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, healthier attributes among moderate users compared to never users may confound the apparent association. A potentially less biased way to examine the association is Mendelian randomization, using alcohol metabolizing genes which influence alcohol use.Methods:We used instrumental variable analysis with aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) genotypes (AA/GA/GG) as instrumental variables for alcohol use to examine the association of alcohol use (10 g ethanol/day) with CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids and glucose) and morbidity (self-reported IHD and CVD) among men in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study.Results:ALDH2 genotypes were a credible instrument for alcohol use (F-statistic 74.6). Alcohol was positively associated with HDL-cholesterol (0.05 mmol/L per alcohol unit, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.08) and diastolic blood pressure (1.15 mmHg, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.07) but not with systolic blood pressure (1.00 mmHg, 95% CI -0.74 to 2.74), LDL-cholesterol (0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.08), log transformed triglycerides (0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.08) or log transformed fasting glucose (0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.006 to 0.03), self-reported CVD (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.27) or self-reported IHD (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.45).Conclusion:Low to moderate alcohol use among men had the expected effects on most CVD risk factors but not fasting glucose. Larger studies are needed to confirm the null associations with IHD, CVD and fasting glucose. © 2013 Au Yeung et al.

84881496063	Alcohol consumption and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy and mediation by elevated blood pressure in older Chinese men: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Background: Chinese people have a markedly lower alcohol consumption than people in the West. Whether alcohol consumption at such levels is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, and the role of blood pressure (BP) in this relationship is unclear. We investigated the association between alcohol consumption and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH) and the mediating role of BP in Chinese men aged ≥50 years. Methods and results: A case-control analysis was conducted on baseline cross-sectional data from the community-based Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008), using standard 12-lead resting electrocardiograms. By comparing 191 new ECG-LVH cases with 4311 controls, excessive drinking (>210g/week) showed excess risks for ECG-LVH (odds ratio [OR]=1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.12-3.24), after adjusting for education, income, occupation, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, fasting glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, BP, and antihypertensive medication. Mediation analysis showed a significant mediating effect of BP on the association between excessive drinking and ECG-LVH: systolic (31%) and diastolic (16%). After multivariate adjustment, no significant association was found between occasional drinking (<once/week: OR=1.20, 95% CI=0.80-1.80) and moderate drinking (≥once/week to ≤210g/week: OR=0.88, 95% CI=0.53-1.47) with increased/decreased risk of ECG-LVH. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption at >210g/week in Chinese men is an independent risk factor for ECG-LVH. Low power prevented us from examining whether drinking at <once/week to ≤210g/week is associated with decreased/increased risk of ECG-LVH. Elevated BP partially mediates between alcohol and ECG-LVH. A Mendelian randomization approach with a large sample size is warranted to determine the relations among alcohol consumption, BP, and LVH. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84882776452	Inequality and inequity in access to health care and treatment for chronic conditions in China: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a large and rapidly-growing problem in China and other middle-income countries. Clinical treatment of NCDs is long-term and expensive, so it may present particular problems for equality and horizontal equity (equal treatment for equal need) in access to health care, although little is known about this at present in low- and middle-income countries. To address this gap, and inform policy for a substantial proportion of the global population, we examined inequality and inequity in general health care utilization (doctor consultations and hospital admissions) and in treatment of chronic conditions (hypertension, hyperglycaemia and dyslipidaemia), in 30 499 Chinese adults aged ≥50 years from one of China's richest provinces, using the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008). We used concentration indices to test for inequality and inequity in utilization by household income per head. Inequality was decomposed to show the contributions of income, indicators of 'need for health care' (age, sex, self-rated health, coronary heart disease risk and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and non-need factors (education, occupation, out-of-pocket health care payments and health insurance). We found inequality and inequity in treatment of chronic conditions but not in general health care utilization. Using more objective and specific measures of 'need for health care' increased estimates of inequity for treatment of chronic conditions. Income and non-need factors (especially health insurance, education and occupation) made the largest contributions to inequality. Further work is needed on why access to treatment for chronic conditions in China is restricted for those on low incomes and how these inequities can be mitigated. © The Author 2012; all rights reserved.

84883481688	The effect of physician's 30 s smoking cessation intervention for male medical outpatients: A pilot randomized controlled trial	ObjectiveTo study the effectiveness of a very brief advice (<30 s) on smoking cessation.DesignA 'proof-of-principle' single-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).SettingMedical outpatient clinics of a general hospital in Guangzhou, China.ParticipantsOne hundred and twenty-six male current smokers randomly allocated into an intervention (n = 74) and a control group (n = 52).InterventionA health warning by physicians that half of all smokers would be killed by smoking, an advice to quit immediately and referral to a cessation clinic. The control group received none.OutcomesPrimary: seven-day quitting point prevalence at 6 months. Secondary: 7-day point prevalence at 1, 3 and 12 months, sustained abstinence at 3, 6 and 12 months, smoking reduction by half and cessation clinic attendance.ResultsBy intention-to-treat analysis, 7-day quitting point prevalence rates at four follow-ups were 27.0, 23.0, 21.6 and 18.9% in the intervention group, compared with 5.8, 3.8, 5.8 and 5.8% in the control group (first three P < 0.05). At 3, 6 and 12 months, sustained abstinence prevalence rates were 18.9, 17.6 and 14.9% versus 3.8, 3.8 and 3.8% (P = 0.035, 0.046, 0.074). More smokers in the intervention group had reduced smoking. Almost no participants attended the cessation clinic.ConclusionOur findings support the need for large RCTs on minimal interventions with the 'one in two' warning. © The Author 2013, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

84884211989	Alcohol consumption and aortic arch calcification in an older Chinese sample: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To examine the association between alcohol consumption and aortic arch calcification (AAC) in an older Chinese sample. Methods: In 27,844 older people aged 50-85, socioeconomic position and lifestyle factors were assessed by a questionnaire. The presence and severity of AAC were diagnosed from chest X-ray by two experienced radiologists. Results: In men, the risk for AAC increased significantly in frequent or excessive drinkers [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.59) and 1.49 (1.21-1.83) for those who drank >5 times/week and those who drank excessively, respectively] (P for trend from 0.002 to 0.001). When AAC was analyzed as an outcome variable with 3 categories of severity, significant dose-response relations between the severity of AAC and alcohol consumption were observed, with those who drank frequently (> 5/week) or excessively having more serious AAC (P for trend = 0.03 and 0.02, respectively). No significant association was found in women as few drank excessively. Conclusion: The presence and severity of AAC were associated with quantity or frequency of alcohol consumption in a dose-response pattern, suggesting that alcohol drinking, even when moderate, has no benefit for AAC. Excessive drinking increased the risk of AAC by 50% compared to never drinkers. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84885642947	Uric acid levels, even in the normal range, are associated with increased cardiovascular risk: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective To examine the association between serum uric acid (UA) levels and cardiovascular risk factors in subjects without diabetes or hyperuricemia. Methods 6172 women and 2662 men aged 50 + years without diabetes from Phase 1 of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study were included. Data on personal history, physical examination and biochemical parameters were collected. Subjects were categorized by serum UA concentration, and the association between UA levels and cardiovascular risk factors was examined using generalized linear models. Results In both men and women with normouricemia (UA < 420 μmol/l in men and < 360 μmol/l in women), tertiles of UA levels were adversely associated with body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total- and HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse pressure, fasting plasma glucose and white blood cell count (P value for trend ranged from 0.04 to < 0.001), and also consistently associated with metabolic disorders including obesity, hypertension, hypertension treatment, dyslipidemia, waist circumference increased since the age of 18 years and the metabolic syndrome (P value for trend ranged from 0.02 to < 0.001). Conclusion Increasing UA levels, even in subjects with normouricemia and without diabetes, were associated with increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that clinically dichotomous definition of hyperuricemia may be inadequate and high-normal value of UA may warn of metabolic disorders. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84890187238	Systematic differences among never, occasional and moderate alcohol users in southern China, and its use in alcohol research: A cross-sectional study	Background Western observational studies show moderate alcohol use, compared with never use, positively associated with health. Moderate users differ systematically from others, making these observations vulnerable to confounding. Observations from other contexts may help distinguish whether these associations are confounded. To assess whether southern Chinese would provide a more suitable setting to examine the association of moderate alcohol use with health, we compared never alcohol users with moderate alcohol users and occasional users in this setting. Methods We used age-adjusted multinomial regression to assess sex-stratified associations of alcohol use (never, occasional (<1 occasion/week), moderate (≤140 g ethanol/week for women and ≤210 g for men)) with health attributes and indicators in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (2003-2008) (n=26 361). Results Among men, moderate alcohol users, when compared with never users, had slightly lower socioeconomic position and unhealthier lifestyle. Conversely, occasional alcohol users, when compared with never users, had higher socioeconomic position and healthier lifestyle. Among women, when compared with never users, both occasional and moderate users had higher socioeconomic position and healthier lifestyle. However, all alcohol users for both sexes, when compared with never users, were more likely to be ever smokers and to be exposed to secondhand smoke. Conclusions Observations in alcohol epidemiology may be affected by confounding due to contextually specific systematic differences. Results from a particular setting should not be interpreted as causal unless they are verified in different populations and, preferably, in nonobservational studies.

84890427251	Effects of Tea Consumption on Renal Function in a Metropolitan Chinese Population: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: Green tea consumption has been associated with many prophylactic health benefits. This study examined for the first time associations between tea consumption and renal function in a Chinese population. Design and Methods: Cross-sectional baseline data including demographics, and lifestyle and weekly consumption of green, black, and oolong tea were analyzed from 12,428 ambulatory subjects aged 50 to 85years (67.3% female) that were randomly selected from the membership list of a community social and welfare association in Guangzhou, China. Intervention: Associations between tea consumption and renal function were assessed using regression analyses to adjust for potential confounding factors. Main Outcome Measure: Renal function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and in a subcohort of 1,910 participants using a spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Results: Six thousand eight hundred and seventy-two participants drank at least 1 type of tea. Oolong tea consumption was negatively associated with eGFR (β-coefficient -0.019, P = .025), but in a gender-stratified analysis this was not the case. In men, black tea was positively associated with eGFR (β-coefficient 0.037, P = .013), but not in women (β-coefficient -0.002, P = .856). Otherwise, no statistically significant consistent associations between the measures of renal function and consumption of green tea, black tea, or oolong tea individually or total tea consumption were identified. Conclusion: Overall there was no clear evidence to suggest any consistent association between renal function and tea consumption in this large population-based study of older Chinese individuals. © 2014 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

84896263852	Adverse lifestyle leads to an annual excess of 2 million deaths in China	Background: Adverse lifestyle factors have been associated with increased mortality, but data are lacking on their combined effect in developing populations, which we address in the present study. Methods: In a death registry-based, case-control study among Hong Kong Chinese aged 30+y, proxy-reported lifestyle factors 10 y ago were collected for 21,363 cases (81% of all deaths) and 12,048 living controls. Risks associated with poor diet, inactivity, heavy alcohol intake, and smoking for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, adjusting for potential confounders, were determined, and excess deaths for the Chinese population were calculated. Results: Adjusted odds ratios for all-cause mortality were 1.15 (95% CI 1.09, 1.23), 1.34 (1.27, 1.43), 1.36 (1.21, 1.52), and 1.58 (1.46, 1.70) for poor diet, inactivity, heavy alcohol intake and smoking, respectively. Increasing numbers of adverse lifestyle factors were associated with a dose-dependent increase in adjusted odds ratios of 1.30 (1.20, 1.40), 1.67 (1.54, 1.81), 2.32 (2.08, 2.60), and 3.85 (3.12, 4.75) for 1, 2, 3, and 4 risk factors relative to those with none. The population attributable fraction for all-cause, all-CVD and all-cancer mortality were 26.6%, 15.0%, and 32.1%, resulting in an excess of 2,017,541; 489,884; and 607,517 deaths annually, respectively. Although smoking was associated with the greatest excess loss of life (867,530), heavy drinking (680,466), and physical inactivity (678,317) were similarly important. Conclusion: Adverse lifestyle factors contribute to one quarter of all deaths in China. Improving lifestyle practices, particularly focussing on moderating alcohol intake and increasing activity, and smoking cessation are critical to reducing the lifestyle-associated health burden. © 2014 Thomas et al.

84896866847	Genetically predicted testosterone and cardiovascular risk factors in men: A mendelian randomization analysis in the guangzhou biobank cohort study	Accepted 22 October 2013 Background Observationally lower testosterone is associated with an unhealthier cardiovascular (CVD) risk profile, but this association is open to confounding and reverse causality. The authors examined the association of testosterone with well-established cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)cholesterol and fasting glucose) and the Framingham score using a Mendelian randomization analysis with a separate-sample instrumental variable estimator. Methods To minimize reverse causality, a genetic score predicting testosterone was developed in 289 young Chinese men from Hong Kong, based on three selected testosterone-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10046, rs1008805 and rs1256031). Multivariable censored and linear regressions were used to examine the association of genetically predicted testosterone levels with CVD risk factors and Framingham score among 4212 older Chinese men from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results Predicted testosterone was unrelated to systolic blood pressure [-0.11 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.70 to 0.48], diastolic blood pressure (0.04 mmHg, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.36), fasting glucose (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06) or Framingham score (0.02, 95% CI -0.0001 to 0.03) but associated with higher LDLcholesterol (0.02 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04) and lower HDL-cholesterol (-0.01 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.001), after adjustment for potential confounders (age, education, smoking status, use of alcohol and body mass index). Conclusions Our findings did not corroborate observed protective effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk factors or risk of ischaemic heart disease among men, but raises the possibility that higher testosterone may be associated with an unhealthier lipid profile. © The Author 2013.

84903818255	Influence of Alzheimer's disease genes on cognitive decline: The Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Cognitive decline is a reduction in cognitive ability usually associated with aging, and those with more extreme cognitive decline either have or are at risk of progressing to mild cognitive impairment and dementia including Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that genetic variants predisposing to AD should be predictive of cognitive decline in elderly individuals. We selected 1325 subjects with extreme cognitive decline and 1083 well-matched control subjects from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study in which more than 30,000 southern Chinese older people have been recruited and followed up. Thirty single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 29 AD-associated genes were genotyped. No statistically significant allelic associations with cognitive decline were found by individual variant analysis. At the level of genotypic association, we confirmed that the APOE ε4 homozygote significantly accelerated cognitive decline and found that carriers of the ACE rs1800764_C allele were more likely to show cognitive decline than noncarriers, particularly in those without college education. However, these effects do not survive after multiple testing corrections, and together they only explain 1.7% of the phenotypic variance in cognitive score change. This study suggests that AD risk variants and/or genes are not powerful predictors of cognitive decline in our Chinese sample. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84904185092	Genetically predicted 17β-estradiol and systemic inflammation in women: A separate-sample Mendelian randomisation analysis in the Guangzhou Biobank cohort study	Background: Many chronic diseases are characterised by low-grade systemic inflammation. Oestrogens may promote immune response consistent with sex-specific patterns of diseases. In vitro culture and animal experiments suggest oestrogens are anti-inflammatory and might thereby protect against low-grade systemic inflammation. Evidence from epidemiological studies is limited. Using a Mendelian randomisation analysis with a separate-sample instrumental variable (SSIV) estimator, we examined the association of genetically predicted 17β-estradiol with well-established systemic inflammatory markers (total white cell count, granulocyte and lymphocyte count). Methods: A genetic score predicting 17β-estradiol was developed in 237 young Chinese women (university students) from Hong Kong based on a parsimonious set of genetic polymorphisms (ESR1 (rs2175898) and CYP19A1 (rs1008805)). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association of genetically predicted 17β-estradiol with systemic inflammatory markers among 3096 older (50+ years) Chinese women from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results: Predicted 17β-estradiol was negatively associated with white blood cell count (-6.3 103/mL, 95% CI -11.4 to -1.3) and granulocyte count (-4.5 10

84905009853	Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2-a potential genetic risk factor for lung function among southern Chinese: Evidence from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Purpose: In Asia, moderate alcohol users have better lung function. Never users have more inactive aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) alleles (A) potentially generating confounding because inactive alleles may increase acetaldehyde exposure and reduce lung function. Methods: We examined the association of ALDH2 genotypes with percentage predicted lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1second; forced vital capacity) for age, sex, and height among 5641 older Chinese using multivariable linear regression. Results: ALDH2 genotypes were associated with alcohol use and height but not other attributes. Inactive alleles were inversely associated with lung function (percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1second-1.52%, 95% confidence interval [CI],-2.52% to-0.51% for one inactive allele and-2.05%, 95% CI,-3.85% to-0.26% for two inactive alleles compared with two active alleles; and for percentage predicted forced vital capacity-1.25%, 95% CI-2.15% to-0.35% and-1.65%, 95% CI,-3.25% to-0.04%). The association of moderate use with lung function was attenuated after adjusting for ALDH2, in addition to other potential confounders. Conclusions: Previous findings in Chinese may be confounded by ALDH2. High frequency of inactive ALDH2 alleles in East Asia may exacerbate the effect of environmental acetaldehyde exposure on lung function and potentially on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84906250493	Height, its components, and coagulability among older Chinese: The Guangzhou biobank cohort study	Objectives: The causal role of some cardiovascular risk factors, such as HDL cholesterol, has been increasingly challenged and attention is returning to all elements of Virchow's triad, i.e., hypercoagulability (including viscosity) as well as endothelial function and blood flow. We examined the life course origins of coagulability. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression to assess whether childhood influences, proxied by height and its components, were associated with hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (HGB), and other hematological parameters in 28,595 older Chinese adults (mean age=61.8 years) from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Results: Adjusted for age, sex, and recruitment phase, leg length was negatively associated with platelets (PLT) (-0.83 × 10

84907502512	Prediction of 4-year incident diabetes in older Chinese: Recalibration of the Framingham diabetes score on Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study	Objective: To recalibrate and modify the Framingham diabetes mellitus (DM) function and establish a simple point score for predicting near-term incident diabetes in a large sample of Chinese. Methods: A total of 16,043 participants aged 50. years or above without diabetes at baseline from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS) were recruited from 2003 to 2008 and followed up until 31 December 2012, with an average follow-up period of 4.1. years. A randomly selected sub-sample of 8000 participants was used to calculate the predictive model and the remaining sample including 8043 participants was used for validating the prediction model. Results: During follow-up, 5.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-5.9) of men and 5.2% (95% CI 4.8-5.6) of women developed diabetes. A GBCS point score prediction model was constructed based on the Framingham DM function risk factors using the randomly selected sub-sample. Compared with the Framingham DM risk score (AUC 0.740, 95% CI 0.715-0.766), the GBCS point score prediction model predicted the development of diabetes well, with an AUC of 0.779 (95% CI 0.756-0.801, P for comparison <. 0.001). Validation analysis showed that the new GBCS function had satisfactory predictive ability for actual DM incidence and improved the calibration substantially. The original Framingham DM score underestimated diabetes incidence in the GBCS sample. Conclusions: The constructed GBCS point score prediction model based on GBCS coefficients could be more useful for identifying high risk individuals in Chinese populations than the original Framingham DM score.

84920099321	Past occupational dust exposure, depressive symptoms and anxiety in retired Chinese factory workers: The Guangzhou biobank cohort study	Objective: Few studies have systematically investigated the impact of past occupational dust exposure on mental health. We examined whether retired factory workers exposed to any of the 4 dusts of silica, cement, coal and asbestos had more depressive symptoms and anxiety in southern China, which has experienced rapid economic development. Methods: We used data from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study phase 3. Exposures, lifestyle, symptoms and medical history of the participants were assessed with a structured interview. Self-reported intensity and duration of past occupational dust exposure were used to derive cumulative exposure. Outcome measures were assessed by the 15-item Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (score =5) and the single-item on anxiety. Results: The results revealed that 359 workers were exposed to at least one of the 4 dusts and that 1,253 were unexposed (controls). After adjustment of multiple confounders, greater risks of depressive symptoms were associated with high exposure to silica (odds ratio (OR) of 3.12, 95% CI of 1.17-8.31) and asbestos (OR of 6.90; CI of 20141.29-36.75). Risks of anxiety were higher in those with low or high exposures to dust (OR of 2.01 and CI of 1.04-3.87 and OR of 2.29 and CI of 1.30-4.03, respectively) and cement (OR of 3.20 and CI of 1.27-8.07 and OR of 2.30 and CI of 1.09-4.87, respectively), and those with high exposure to silica (OR of 5.29, CI of 1.76-15.92). Conclusions: Past occupational exposures to silica, cement, coal and asbestos dusts were associated with adverse mental health outcomes in retired factory workers. The mechanism underlying the relationship between occupational exposures and psychological symptoms in later life needs to be further studied.
