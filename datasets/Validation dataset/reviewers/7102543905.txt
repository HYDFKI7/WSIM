8744269446	Reaction of iso-butanethiol conversion over HZSM-5 catalyst	The reaction of iso-butanethiol catalyzed by HZSM-5 catalyst was investigated in a laboratory fixed-bed catalytic cracking micro-reactor. The results show that iso-butanethiol is cracked and converted into hydrogen sulfide at a lower temperature of 300°C. When methanol was added into the reaction system, the reaction route of mercaptan converted into hydrogen sulfide was changed, and methylthiol and dimethylsulfid were found in the products. The addition of ethanol also affected the iso-butanethiol transformation, resulting in the increase of the hydrogen sulfide yield in some extent, but excessive ethanol molecules would take too many catalyst active sites and would cause the yield of hydrogen sulfide to decrease. The acidity of catalyst greatly affected the iso-butanethiol reaction, the stronger the catalyst acidity, the more complete the transformation of mercaptan. The results also suggest that the mechanism of catalytic transformation of iso-butanethiol is via a carbonium reaction route over the solid acid catalyst. In the case of methanol addition, the iso-butanethiol reacts with H

8744279333	Progress in research of separation and enrichment of sulfur compounds in heavy petroleum distillates	The development and progress of oxidation-reduction procedure and chromatography are mainly reviewed and evaluated. In oxidation-reduction procedure, the low polar sulfur compounds are oxidized into the high polar sulfoxides and sulfones to obtain higher purity of sulfur compounds. However, the different structural sulfur compounds have distinct recoveries, and the general recovery is very low. The operation of chromatography is relatively easy. By means of modifying the absorbent with the selective complexing agent and choosing the proper eluant, higher recoveries for some sulfides and thiophenes are obtained. But this method can not be used to separate some external thiophenes with condensed aromatics. The sulfur compounds in heavy distillate oil can be separated effectively by the joint use of chromatography and other separation methods. The sulfur compounds from separation can be qualified and quantified by GC-FPD or GC-MS method.

The observed sulfur-containing product distribution reveals that the solvent used has a large effect on the sulfur distribution. When benzene was the solvent, dihydrothiophene, thiophene, and hydrogen sulfide were the main sulfur compounds produced in the decomposition process. However, only hydrogen sulfide was the main product when tetrahydrothiophene in tetralin was thermally decomposed. 1,3-Butadiene is the significant component among all of the hydrocarbons produced. Plausible decomposition pathways leading to the observed products were investigated by quantum mechanical calculations using the B3LYP density functional theory for geometry optimization and QCISD(T) for energy evaluation.

Di-n-butyl sulfide is easily cracked and basically converted into H2S over ZSM-5 zeolite while the reaction temperature exceeds 350°C. As a main product, Tetrahydrothiophene (THT) is formed in the course of the cracking desulfurization of di-n-butyl sulfide. Ce-modified HZSM-5 zeolites show higher cracking conversion of sulfide than parent HZSM-5 zeolite, and the yield of THT increases.

Amount of CeO2 impregnated has an important effect on its state of existing over HZSM-5 zeolite. When the impregnated amount is low, CeO2 exists only in amorphous highly dispersed; with the increasing of Ce-impregnated amount, a part of CeO2 is found to be crystal state. BET specific surface area decreases while HZSM-5 zeolites were modified by Ce. The impregnation of CeO2 also results in the proportion of the weak acid decreasing, and that of the mid-strong acid or strong acid increasing. The cracking desulfurization reaction of iso-butyl mercaptan over HZSM-5 or Ce-modified HZSM-5 zeolite in the presence of methanol was studied in the fixed-bed catalytic micro-reactor.

0034272989	A theoretical investigation of the decomposition mechanism of pyridyl radicals	We carried out a detailed quantum mechanical study of the unimolecular decomposition mechanism of pyridine. The critical structures of all reasonable reaction pathways were optimized by density functional theory using the B3LYP functional and 6-3IG** basis set. Relative energies were evaluated based on single-point QCISD(T)/cc-pVDZ energies. In agreement with general belief and pervious theoretical studies, the calculated results indicate that C-H bond scission in pyridine preferentially produces the o-pyridyl radical. Also in agreement with the accepted mechanism, the calculations indicate that ring-opening via C-N bond cleavage in o-pyridyl radical is more favorable than C-C bond cleavage, as the former has a significantly lower activation barrier and the resulting open-chain cyano radical is more stable than other linear CsNFL; radicals. The calculated activation energy for the formation of cyanovinylacetylene + H from the open-chain cyano radical is the lowest, compared to the other channels considered. However, activation entropy favors C-C bond cleavage producing acetylene and cyanovinyl radical instead of cyanovinylacetylene and atomic hydrogen. On the basis of the calculated activation energies and activation entropies, transition state theory predicts that, in the temperature range of 1300-1800 K, the formation of acetylene + cyanovinyl radical from o-pyridyl radical is two to three times the rate of formation of cyanovinylacetylene + H. The calculations indicate that direct C-H bond scission from all three pyridyl radicals producing 2,3- and 3,4-pyridynes is also a favorable channel from energy consideration. © 2000 American Chemical Society.

Etch pit morphology varies as species conformation changes. [421̄] steps appeared in the presence of each of Gly, l-Glu, l-Lys, malonate, and succinate. The overall shape of etch pits became hexagonal in Gly, malonate, and succinate, while a pseudotriangular shape in l-Glu solution and a sectorial shape in l-Lys solution were observed, primarily as a result of molecular chirality. Unexpectedly, [010] instead of [421̄] steps emerged in l-Asp solution, giving a trapezoidal pit shape. Despite the differences in molecular structure of 6-aminohexanoate, acetate, oxalate, and glutarate, these molecules did not show any influence on pit morphology, revealing that solid/fluid recognition must depend on the geometry of additives, especially the distance between functional groups. We show that both the ammonium and the carboxylate groups are active in surface binding and that the organic acids tend to bind through more than one functional group to the calcite face. Our AFM results confirm the crucial role of geometrical matching between calcite and modifiers and show that step edge reactivity, stereochemical correspondence, electrostatic attraction, and molecular chirality play a secondary role in surface modification.

It is demonstrated that during the storage or under stressing conditions, the diesel becomes deteriorated, and some unstable phenols, thiols and some nitrogen compounds involve in the color change and deposit formation. The content of thiols and phenols reduces during the accelerated aging of diesel. The contents of heteroatoms (S, N, O) in the deposit are a few times higher than that in the diesel. When phenols or thiols in diesel are removed, the stability of diesel is improved to some degree.

0036995379	The oxidation of thiols and its effects on the stability of fludized catalytic cracked diesel	The oxidation of thiols in FCC diesel and the mechanism of its effects on the stability of diesel were studied by GC and GC-MS analyses. Thiols could be easily oxidized by hydro-peroxides. The existence of active hydrocarbons and other non-hydrocarbons in diesel had great effect on the oxidation of thiols. The addition reaction between olefin and thiol could be initiated by the hydro-peroxides produced from the auto-oxidation of active hydrocarbons. The non-hydrocarbons, e.g., naphthol and alkylindoles, could be further reacted with the products and formed the colored compounds with higher boiling point and higher polarity. On the basis of these results, the mechanism of the effect of thiols on the stability of diesel was postulated.

0037145281	A study of the distribution of sulfur compounds in gasoline fraction produced in China: Part 2. The distribution of sulfur compounds in full-range FCC and RFCC naphthas	The analysis of sulfur distributions in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) naphtha and residue fluid catalytic cracking (RFCC) naphtha, produced by different refineries, reveals that the distribution of sulfur compounds in different naphtha are alike. The percentage of mercaptan sulfur and disulfide sulfur are low; the sulfide sulfur is in the middle and most part of sulfur in naphtha fraction is thiophenic sulfur, which is over 60% of the total sulfur. The only difference of sulfur distribution between FCC and RFCC naphtha is that the content of thiophenic sulfur in RFCC naphtha fraction is higher than that in FCC naphtha fraction, which almost accounts for 70% of the total sulfur. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0036955641	Analysis of copper strip corrosion and application of anti-corrosion additive used for copper strip corrosion test for FCC gasoline	The copper strip corrosion qualification for FCC gasoline is one of the national standards. Since more AGO or VGO as the feed of FCC unit, the copper strip corrosion of FCC naphtha is becoming one thorny problem. According to the national standard test method and the modem equipment analysis, an approach to the copper strip corrosion of some independent sulfides and corrosive gasoline was carried out, and the products formed on the copper strip were analyzed. The results demonstrate that the different active sulfides can induce the different corrosion degrees for copper strip. The existence of active sulfides in gasoline is the reason resulting in copper strip corrosion. An anti-corrosion additive UNOP-2 for FCC gasoline was developed. The copper strip corrosion test for sulfides and gasoline were made. The anti-corrosion characteristic tests demonstrate that UNOP-2 has the good solubility in gasoline and strong ability to prevent the copper strip corrosion.

84867925457	Performance evaluation of liquid catalysts for removal of mercaptan	Multi-sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine was synthesized by the reaction of cobalt phthalocynine with chlorosulfonic acid, and then a liquid catalyst (Cat.A) with 23.8%(w) of the multi-sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine as the active component for the removal of mercaptans from gasoline was prepared by dissolving the active component in sodium hydroxide solution with a stabilizer and an antifreezer. Cat.A was characterized by sulfur content analysis, dynamic light scattering analysis and potentiometric titration to investigate its structure, size distribution and catalytic activity, and compared with imported and domestic liquid desulfurization catalysts. The experimental results show that the average sulfonic group number in the every multi-sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine molecule in Cat.A is 3.4. The active component in the alkali solution has good dispersity, solubility and stability. The removal rate of the mercaptans in gasoline could reach 90% using Cat.A under the conditions of the catalyst mass concentration 100 μg/g, the catalyst dosage 3 mL, gasoline with 255 μg/g of mercaptan sulfur mass concentration 30 mL, reaction temperature 30°C and reaction time 30 min.

84871441743	Steam channeling control in the steam flooding of super heavy oil reservoirs, Shengli Oilfield	In view of the severe steam channeling in the steam flooding of super heavy reservoir, lab experiment on steam channeling control were carried out. The combination of nitrogen foam and thermoset blocking agent was tested to seal steam channeling, in which thermoset blocking agent plugs big pore throats, while nitrogen foam adjusts steam absorption profile. The optimized foam formulation has a resistance factor of over 30 at 300 °C, can plug low oil saturation areas selectively, and applies to the plugging of high permeability zones in super-heavy oil reservoirs. Thermoset blocking agent, which would consolidate at 120 °C in 4 h and consolidate at 150 °C in 2 h, can provide effective plugging during dynamic steam flooding. The best steam channeling control mode was determined using parallel tube model. By the combination of nitrogen foam and thermoset blocking agent, the recovery rate is 5.7% higher than the application of nitrogen foam only, with the overall sweeping efficiency reaching up to 60.8%. In 2011, the mode was used in the steam flooding in Shan-56 reservoir. The water cut drops 10.2%, the wellhead temperature of producer drops more than 15 °C, the oil production of the well group increases over 28 tons per day, the valid period of a single cycle is up to 198 days, and the oil production increases 2 562 t, showing significant improvement in steam flooding. © 2012 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

84874360920	A study on a thermal compound chemical method for improving development efficiency of heavy-oil reservoirs with strong sensitivity	Heavy-oil reservoirs with extremely strong water sensitivity in the Shengli oilfield are mainly distributed in the Jinjia oilfield and their reserves amount to more than 20 million tons. In addition, the thermal recovery effect only by steam injection seems poor and it is difficult to effectively produce these reserves because the water sensitivity index for this kind of reservoirs exceeds 0.9. In view of the above contradiction, a thermal compound chemical method research was carried out, in which real cores from the Jinjia oilfield were used to evaluate different displacement manners based on thermal compound chemical flooding, such as the vapor+high-temperature antiswelling agent, steam+high-performance oil displacement agent, and steam+high-performance oil displacement agent+high-temperature condensation agent. Composition changes of clay minerals, clay distributions in pore throats and radius distributions of pore throats were measured by means of X diffraction, scanning electron microscope, cast thin section and mercury-injection in order to explore principle mechanisms of the enhanced oil recovery with the thermal compound chemical method under high-temperature conditions. The results showed that the thermal compound chemical displacement manner with the steam+high-temperature oil displacement agent+high-temperature condensation agent can promote the transformation of montmorillonite to illite and the dissolution of part kaolinite at the same time, which can greatly improve pore-throat flow channels of reservoirs to form large "hot-wormholes" that remarkably increase the permeability and flooding displacement efficiency of heavy-oil reservoirs with strong water sensitivity.

84881631170	3D physical simulation of steam flooding and applications in ultra-heavy oil reservoirs of Shengli oilfield	A three-dimensional physical simulation on steam flooding of ultra-heavy oil reservoirs for an inverted nine-spot well network was designed according to reservoir conditions of the Shan-56 block in the Shengli oilfield and conducted under conditions of the 20%, 40% and 60% steam dryness respectively, in order to analyze the production status of a single well or well group and improve recovery effects of ultra-heavy oil reservoirs by nitrogen foam injection on the basis of steam flooding. The experimental results show that the steam channeling of ultra-heavy oil reservoirs is relatively severe, the comprehensive water cut rises fast and steam chambers develop unevenly. Edge wells have an increase in production, while corner wells show a poor temperature growth and low level both liquid and crude production, thus contributing a little to the well group output. The steam flooding recovery could be enhanced remarkably by increasing the steam dryness, for instance, the displacement efficiency of steam flooding increased by 19.86% when the dryness of injected steam rose from 20% to 60%. When slug injection was a 0.093 PV foam system on the basis of steam flooding, the steam channeling could be effectively suppressed along with a remarkable decrease in both the liquid production and comprehensive water cut of edge wells. Moreover, a temperature field around corner wells began to develop along with a significant increase in both the liquid and crude production, the comprehensive water cut of intervals decreased by 7%, while the recovery ratio was enhanced by over 15%. Therefore, the enhanced oil recovery of ultra-heavy oil reservoirs can be further increased by increasing the steam dryness in steam flooding associated with an auxiliary profile control technique, nitrogen foam injection.

84884218960	Short peptide-directed synthesis of one-dimensional platinum nanostructures with controllable morphologies	Although one dimensional (1D) Pt nanostructures with well-defined sizes and shapes have fascinating physiochemical properties, their preparation remains a great challenge. Here we report an easy and novel synthesis of 1D Pt nanostructures with controllable morphologies, through the combination of designer self-assembling I 3 K and phage-displayed P7A peptides. The nanofibrils formed via I 3 K self-assembly acted as template. Pt precursors ((PtCl 4) 2-and (PtCl 6) 2-) were immobilized by electrostatic interaction on the positively charged template surface and subsequent reduction led to the formation of 1D Pt nanostructures. P7A was applied to tune the continuity of the Pt nanostructures. Here, the electrostatic repulsion between the deprotonated C-terminal carboxyl groups of P7A molecules was demonstrated to play a key role. We finally showed that continuous and ordered 1D Pt morphology had a significantly improved electrochemical performance for the hydrogen and methanol electro-oxidation in comparison with either 1D discrete Pt nanoparticle assemblies or isolated Pt nanoparticles.

84885352410	Supramolecular interaction of petroleum components and model compounds	Petroleum is commonly described as an extremely complex mixture, the interest on the complex colloidal dispersion and its stability are growing, especially the asphaltene supramolecular aggregate which is closely related to the stability of petroleum. Meanwhile, people have been arguing about the main forces of asphaltene association. Here, the development of the supramolecular interaction in the self-associated process of petroleum components and their model compounds is reviewed. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that asphaltenes have a strong tendency to form supramolecular aggregates via hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, polar interactions and other interactions. One method to improve the understanding of liquid-phase association behavior relevant to asphaltenes is to synthesize pure compounds that contain selected chemical structures, and then to examine their behavior in solution. Finally, the prospects are pointed out based on the current development of the system.

84892776897	Solid-phase synthesis and catalytic sweetening performance of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine from sulfonated phthalic anhydride mixture	A relatively green, efficient and economical synthetic route for the one-step solid-phase synthesis of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine from sulfonated phthalic anhydride mixture was studied, and could solve the serious problems of waste acid pollution and the low utilization of materials in the direct sulfonation of phthalocyanine. The optimal reaction conditions were using a phthalic anhydride mixture with a sulfonation degree of 60% as the raw material, a ratio of urea to PA-SPA mixture of 4:1, a ratio of cobalt chloride to PA-SPA mixture of 1:4, ammonium molybdate (1 wt%) as catalyst, and carrying out the reaction at 260 °C for 3 hours. Under these optimal conditions, a yield of 52.9% can be achieved. Through sweetening experimental studies, the synthesized sulfonated cobalt(II) phthalocyanine had better sweetening performance than the industrial catalysts, in both the liquid-liquid sweetening and fixed bed sweetening experiments. A sweetening rate of 93% can be achieved in 20 min with the synthesized catalyst in a fixed bed. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

84896298467	Distribution of the functional oxygen content in heavy oils	potentiometric titration method. The heptane asphaltene and heptane soluble fractions of KLMY and WNRL were investigated by FT-IR, respectively, and the heptane asphaltene of WNRL was characterized by XPS. The results indicated that there was a common distribution rule of functional oxygen content in different heavy oils. The most existing functional oxygens were aldehyde and ketone carbonyl oxygen, ester oxygen and carboxyl oxygen. Petroleum refining process had an influence on the distribution of the functional oxygen content in heavy oil. The ≤ CO, -COOH, -COO- and -OH functional groups were in oil, and the content of aldehyde and ketone carbonyl oxygen was the most in KLMY and the characteristic absorption peak of ester group was obviously in WNRL. All of these results were consistent with the distribution result of the functional oxygen content determined by potentiometric titration method. There was a good deal of C-O on the surface of WNRL heptane asphaltene.

84898918420	New determination method for sulfonation degree of phthalic anhydride by RP-HPLC	A novel method was developed to monitor the reaction process and evaluate the sulfonation level in the sulfonation of phthalic anhydride by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The product peak was identified in chromatograms through product analysis and by comparing its retention time with that of standard compounds. By comparing the hydrolysis and alcoholysis methods, optimized pretreatment of the sample was found for RP-HPLC. Based on the determined percentages of phthalic anhydride and sulfonated phthalic anhydride in the mixture, the degree of sulfonation was calculated. When the sulfonation degree of phthalic anhydride was in the range of 2.8-71%, the recovery of 97-104% was achieved, and the procedure was rapid and accurate. © The Author [2013].

84900502402	Content distribution and existing form of Fe in crude and residual oil	The Fe contents in Venezuela, Karamay, Liaohe, Dagang crude oil and their corresponding atmospheric residue(AR), vacuum residue(VR) were determined. And the Fe content distribution in SARA and Fe existing forms and their distribution in crude oil, AR and VR were also studied. The results showed that the Fe content in crude oil, AR and VR increased with the boiling range rising, and that the Fe was mainly concentrated in VR. The Fe were mainly concentrated in resin and asphaltene of SARA components, and the distribution of Fe content in asphaltene increased obviously with the boiling range rising of crude oil fractions. The Fe in crude oil and residue was mainly oil-soluble Fe, which was of 75%-99% proportion of total Fe and increased with the boiling range rising of the crude oil and their corresponding AR, VR. The petroleum acid Fe content was related to the acid value of crude oil. With the crude oil becoming heavier, the porphyrine and non-porphyrine Fe contents increased.

84902281706	Exploration of accurate evaluation methods for oil-soluble viscosity reducing agent	This paper established an evaluation method for oil-soluble polymer viscosity reducing agent to heavy crude oil. The viscosity reducing agent was synthesized in laboratory and evaluated effects of diluent, mixing time, storage temperature and storage time on the viscosity reduction of crude oil. After inspection found that the evaluation methods have a significant impact on the viscosity reduction ratio. The maximum stable viscosity reduction rate can be obtained under optimal conditions. In the conditions of kerosene as diluents (ratio of 9:1), mixing time of 40 °C, storaged at 50 °C for 10 h, the viscosity reduction rate of 87% was achieved. The viscosity reduction rate can truly reflect the actual viscosity reduction ratio. This method can accurately determine the rate of viscosity reduction reducing agent for such other researchers evaluated in this method, the rate of viscosity reduction obtained is comparable in different labs. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
