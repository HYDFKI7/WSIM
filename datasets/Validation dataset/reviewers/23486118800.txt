84940338453	Rapid prototyped titanium plate combined with autologous cancellous bone graft repairs canine mandibular defects	BACKGROUND: Rapid prototyping technique has been recently applied in the medical reconstruction and allows the production of individual implant for patients with tissue defects, achieving an accurate repair. OBJECTIVE: To repair discontinuous mandibular defects in dogs using rapid prototyped titanium plate in combination with autologous cancellous bone graft. METHODS: Nine hybrid canines were used, and the skull was scanned using spiral CT. Then CT data were used to construct three-dimensional digital model, in which virtual partial mandibulectomy was performed, and an individualized bone-grafting plate was designed. A titanium plate was manufactured using rapid prototyping and titanium casting. Animal experiment was then performed. A 40-mm discontinuous defect in the right mandibular body was created in the involved dogs. The defect was restored immediately using the customized plate in combination with autologous cancellous iliac blocks. Sequential radionuclide bone imaging, biomechanical testing, three-dimensional microcomputed tomographic scanning, radiology and histological examination were used to evaluate the turnover of the grafts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A symmetric mandible was reconstructed using the rapid prototyped grafting plate. The grafted bone survived and got corticalized, while a fibrous intermedium was found between the bone graft and the plate. In the reconstruction of mandibular defects, optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes could be achieved using the rapid prototyped grafting plates.

20544436706	Histopathological changes of the model of lamb indirect temporomandibular joint injury induced by multifunctional biological striking	Aim: To investigate the temporomandibular joint(TMJ) injury by establishing the animal model of direct bilateral TMJ injury induced by multifunctional biological striking. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Laboratory for Trauma in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, College of Stomatology, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from June 2002 to April 2003. The studying subjects were 15 lambs. The lambs were injured by the steel-made cylinder projectile of 0.845 kg pushed at 1 MPa, and another 3 animals were as controls. The changes of injured bilateral TMJ structure were observed at 3 days, 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks to compare with those of the normal controls. Results: At 3 days after injury, the laceration of synovial membrane, the osseous destruction of temporal bone and condylar process, the hemarthrosis of articular cavity, and the break of articular disc and attachment were found in the suffered sides, and hemarthrosis was found less at 7 days. Intraarticular destructive change was obvious, and effusion in articular cavity was found at 2 weeks. At 1 month posttrauma, the completely damaged structure of unilateral articular disc in partial animals was found, besides the loss of cartilage of the condylar process and effusion in articular cavity were also observed. Meanwhile, the disorder structure of joint, obvious deformation and irregularity of articular disc and condylar process were seen in the opposite sides of joint. Three months later, the structure of most joints was nearly normal, but the destructive changes were still found, accompanied by remarkable intraarticular crevice or bladder-like change, thinner cartilage tissues, brisement of articular disc, expansion of articular cavity, and so on. Conclusion: Trauma of the lamb chin can result in irreversible changes in bilateral TMJ, alter the internal environment of the joints and induce the attack of TMJ. Hemarthrosis and destruction of articular disc play an important role in the pathogenesis of traumatic arthropathy.

20544446876	Design and establishment of animal model with strain-testing during mandible distraction osteogenesis	Aim: To design and assemble a kind of extension apparatus for stain-testing during mandible distraction osteogenesis, and establish an animal model with simply-operated strain-testing during mandible distraction osteogenesis. Methods: The extension apparatus for strain-testing during mandible distraction osteogenesis was self-designed and assembled, and the osteotomy was completed on the same position of 12 rabbits at the junction of mandibular angle and body. The jaw extension apparatus adhered with strain gauge was used to tract mandibles of rabbits. The encapsulation materials of urethanes and silastics were compared to find suitable encapsulation materials. The osteogenesis was observed after distraction with general and X-ray observation. Results: Distraction osteogenesis was carried out successfully on all the rabbits. The rabbits with silastics as the encapsulation material could transfer the strain signals successfully, while those with urethanes as the encapsulation material could not do it well. Conclusion: The rabbit with silastics as the encapsulation material is an ideal animal model with strain-testing during mandible distraction osteogenesis.

0031987919	Experimental study on firearm wound in maxillofacial region	Objective To make clear the range of firearm wound in the maxillofacial region, the optical repair time and the characteristics of accompanied indirect brain damage, and to offer the principle of emergency treatment and the early repair of war wound. Methods With the aid of the standard Sweden model, 200 dogs were used in the experiment. Varies tissues around the primary canal were harvested chronologically, in different zone and different tissue, for histopathological examination. Results The necrotic range of various tissues in the maxillofacial region was less than that in the extremities. In the maxillofacial region, there was a significant temporary cavity following the passing of bullet, which caused indirect brain damages. Conclusion These findings are helpful to the treatment of war wound in the maxillofacial region. Early bone transplantation using microvascular anastomosis in the treatment of gunshot wound in the maxillofacial region is recommendable.

2442573988	Investigation on rabbits' cervical vascular explosive injury	Aim. To investigate the mechanism of cervical vascular blast injury during head-neck region explosive injury. Methods. After the detonation of the blast sources from different distances near cervical region, the damages to the rabbits' neck and vessels were examined, and the pressure of the blast waves to both the skins and carotid were measured with PVDF sensors and oscilloscopes. Results. Walls of the vessels were damaged and thrombi form on the damaged walls after injury. Crevices or cavities were found in tunica media of arteries. We found micro-thrombi mainly made up of platelets on the walls of arteries and thrombi in veins, which can occlude the cavities of the vessels. Conclusions. Strong blast waves can damage cervical vessels and thrombus can easily form on the walls of veins and even occlude the vessels; the walls of arteries can be seriously damaged, and this may account for the possible reasons of pseudo-aneurysm formation. These may provide theoretical basis to save suffers from explosive injury.

2442495482	Effect of calcium chloride on proliferation and differentation of osteoblastic cells	Aim. For correct using calcium chloride in injectable tissue-engineered bone, we study effect of calcium chloride on proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells. Methods. The osteoblasts were isolated from iliac bone of New Zealand rabbits, then were cultured in DMEM medium with different concentrations of calcium chloride. After 24, 72, 120 h culture, effect of different levels of calcium chloride on proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells were assessed by the measurement of cellular metabolism activity and alkaline phosphate activity. Results. After the osteoblasts were cultured in DMEM medium with different concentrations of calcium chloride (1-10 mmol) for 24, 72, 120 h, with the concentration of calcium chloride rises in the medium, cellular metabolism activity of every experimental groups decline except 1 mmol calcium chloride for 72 h, which had a little promoting effect. With the concentration of calcium chloride rises in the medium, alkaline phosphate activity decline. The difference between experimental group and control group was statistically significant(P < 0.01). Conclusion. Calcium chloride can inhibit proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic cells.

2442499311	Evaluation of mandibular distraction osteogenesis and time of distractor removal in the goats	Aim: To establish an animal model of mandibular distraction osteogenesis in goats and evaluate its physical and biomechanical properties. To explore time of the distractor removal. Methods: Eight goats were used for experiment. Extraoral distractors were activated 7 days after mandibular corticotomy at a rate of 0.5 mm twice daily, for 8 days. Radiographic examination, bone densitometry and 3-point mechanical testing were performed on the harvested mandibles. Results: Radiographic evaluation suggested definite ossification. Mineralized tissue was seen bridging the defect as early as 2 weeks. Analysis of the new bone densities failed to reveal any statistical differences between the control group and experiment group. The average peak load of the lengthening group was 61% of the control group at 4 weeks after lengthening. Conclusions: The goat is a good animal for the experiment of distraction osteogenesis. Distractor removal at 4 weeks after lengthening may be accepted.

2442526678	Survey of epidemiological characters of maxillofacial injuries in hospitalized patients	Aim: To analyse the epidemiological characters of maxillofacial injuries by the retrospective study of many clinical data of epidemiology in hospitalized patients. Methods: A retrospective review of patients admitted to the Stomatology Hospital of Fourth Military Medical University from January, 1996 to October, 2002 was done. Data was collected on age, sex, etiology and mechanism of injury, location and clinical characters, associated injuries and treatment. Statistic analysis of the data was done. Results: One thousand one hundred and fifty-nine patients was reviewed. The majority of victims were males. The ratio of male and female was 3.95: 1. Road traffic accident(RTA) was the major cause of facial injury (59.92%, 590 cases), followed by violence injury(19.07%, 221 cases), falling injury(9.66%, 112 cases), occupational injury(7.33%, 85 cases), sports injury (0.86%, 10 cases) and iatrogenic injury (0.60%, 7cases). A large proportion of facial injuries occurred on the lower face. The symphysis of mandible was most frequently damaged, followed by condyle. The most common associated trauma was extremity fractures. Conclusion: Prevention and management of maxillofacial trauma should be strengthened and its characterastics of multiple injuries should always be anticipated and identified.

27644489538	Functional changes of tissues in response to different distraction osteogenesis rates	Aim: To investigate the functional changes of the perimysium of digastric muscle in response to different distraction rates in rabbit mandible in order to suppress the bad influence of soft tissues on distraction osteogenesis. Methods: The experiment was done in the labartory of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Stomatological Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from December 2003 to March 2004. The mandible of rabbits was advanced bilaterally for about 1.2 cm at the rates of 1 and 2 mm per day respectively. The samples of digastic muscle were made post-distraction osteogenesis, after a two-week consolidation and after a four-week consolidation to make paraffin sections following by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Picrosirius-polarization method was used to investigate the thickness of the perimysium and the proportional changes of type I and II collagen under a polarization microscope using Photoshop software. Results: The perimysium became thicken at the distraction rate of 1 mm per day. When the mandible was distracted at the distraction rate of 2 mm per day, the perimysium became thinner obviously. Conclusion: The distraction rate of 1 mm per day is appropriate for the functional changes of intramuscular connective tissues.

33645062946	Distraction osteogenesis in the irradiated rabbit mandible	Purpose: The potential use of distraction osteogenesis in mandibular reconstruction has been limited by its questionable efficacy in previously radiated bone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of irradiation on mandibular distraction osteogenesis (DO). Materials and method: Six rabbits received a unilateral irradiation (group R) in the mandible with a total dose of 27.0 Gy in five 5.4 Gy fractions (equivalent to 50 Gy/25 fractions). The contralateral side served as control (group C). Bilateral osteotomy was made 3 months after completion of irradiation. After a 1-week latency period bone distraction was activated at a rate of 0.5 mm twice daily for 8 days, followed by a consolidation phase of 6 weeks. New bone underwent radiographic, densitometric, histological and histomorphometric analysis. Results: Two rabbits were excluded from the study, one due to infection on both sides and death in another animal. After 6 weeks of consolidation, the irradiation group had no significantly lower BMD than control group. No difference was found between the percent area of new bone in both groups. New bone was more mature and organised of group C than in groups R. Larger chondroid islands were found evident in distracted bone of group R than group C. Conclusions: It seems that DO can be feasible in previously irradiated rabbit mandible. © 2005 The British Association of Plastic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33747344705	Improvement of suture expansion on growth and development of maxillary bone	Aim: To detect proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) positive expression in suture cells around maxilla, and explore the improvement of suture expansion on the growth and development of maxilla. Methods: The experiment was accomplished at the Laboratory of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Stomatology College of the Fourth Military Medical University of Chinese PLA between March and September 2005. Twelve mongrel dogs of 15 weeks old were randomly assigned into four groups: one-week experimental group (n=4), one-week control group (n=2), four-week experimental group (n=4) and four-week control group (n=2). The dogs of experimental groups were fitted with distraction devices, and traction hook was educed from palatine foramen, with rubber ring as connection between device and hook. Forward elastic traction was exerted respectively for 1 week and 4 weeks at 600 g force. All the dogs were executed at the end of force application, then transverse palatine suture (TPS), premaxilla-maxillary suture (PMS), zygomaticomaxillary suture (ZMS) and zygomaticotemporal suture (ZTS) were harvested. PCDA monoclonal antibody was stained with immunohistochemical technique, while the distribution and amount of proliferating cells in sutures were detected and analyzed statistically. Results: There were 12 dogs surviving until prearranged observation period. 1More PCNA-positive expressions were observed in cells of TPS and ZMS in one-week experimental group than in one-week control group (One-week experimental group: TPS: 48.69±5.42, ZMS: 46.44±3.72; One-week control group: TPS: 34.00±3.26, ZMS: 33.75±5.58, P < 0.05). 2And PCNA-positive expressions were higher in cells of all these sutures in four-week experimental group than in four-week control group and one-week experimental group (Four-week experimental group: PMS: 70.78±3.58, TPS: 69.9±2.62, ZMS: 68.56±4.15, ZTS: 64.25±2.82; Four-week control group: PMS: 32.95±3.24, TPS: 34.83±5.68, ZMS: 34.26±3.37, ZTS: 33.46±3.47; One-week experimental group: PMS: 38.97±4.25, TPS: 48.69±5.42, ZMS: 46.44±3.72, ZTS: 36.06±4.34, P < 0.05). Conclusion: Significantly increased proliferating cells and their activities are observed in maxilla after suture expansion, which implies suture expansion can improve the growth and development of maxilla.

33749137286	Transport distraction osteogenesis using nitinol spring: An exploration in canine mandible	Some experiments in rabbits have presented the potential feasibility of using shape memory alloy spring for continuous distraction osteogenesis. To confirm the effectiveness of such method, we established canine models for the exploratory experiments of transport distraction osteogenesis using nitinol springs. Simple devices, including an internal 60-mm long sinusoid-shaped nitinol springs were used in the study. All dogs needed only one operation. In theoperation, osteotomy was performed to create a 40-mm unilateral segmental mandibular body defect and a tooth-bearing transport bone disc. After reconstructive fixation of the remnant mandible, the spring was constricted and anchored across the distraction gap to activate transport distraction immediately. At the second experimental stage, an ePTFE sheet was further fixed to protect the defect and distraction gap before closing the incision. Control dogs underwent the same operation except for anchoring of the spring to examine the spontaneous bone regeneration. Automatic bone transportation, as a gradual slowdown process, was observed under the effect of the spring. The transport disc could get to the opposite side of the defect, or stopped halfway when ePTFE sheet intervened. Mandibular reconstruction was achieved in all these dogs and better in dogs with sheet protection. No integrated bone mass was found in the defect of control dogs. The study further proves that continuous distraction osteogenesis using nitinol springs is a practical technique, although the devices need more improvement for better control of the process of distraction and the quality of regenerated bone.

33846404495	Transplantation of osteoblast-like cells to the distracted callus in the rabbit mandible	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether injections of marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells could be used to facilitate new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis. METHODS: Fifteen New Zealand rabbits underwent bilateral osteotomy. After a 1-week latency period, bone distraction was activated at a rate of 2.0 mm/day for 5 days. The marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from the ilium marrow were cultured to a population of 10 in 0.5 ml and then unilaterally transplanted to the gap of distracted callus immediately after distraction had been terminated. Rabbits were killed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after completion of bone lengthening. The distracted areas were harvested and evaluated by histologic, histomorphometric, radiographic, and scanning electron microscopic analysis. Bone mineral density in the lengthened callus was evaluated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Radiographic evaluation indicated a significant increase in bony union of the distraction regenerate in the experimental side compared with the control side. Corresponding to the radiographic findings, the histologic examination showed an earlier and more intensive bone formation in the experimental side after 2, 4, and 6 weeks compared with the control side. Larger chondroid islands were found evident in distracted bone of the control side than in the experimental side. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that transplantation of osteoblast-like cells promotes maturity of the distracted callus, as observed on the second and fourth weeks after lengthening. The method appears promising as a means of shortening the consolidation period of osteodistraction and decreasing complications during bone lengthening. ©2007American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

33847138106	The role of bone morphogenetic protein-2 in vivo in regeneration of peripheral nerves	We investigated the effects of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and some other BMPs on regeneration of peripheral motor nerves in vivo. The facial nerves of 24 New Zealand rabbits were crushed to examine a series of retrograde changes in the facial nuclei and axons, in what has been called the "axon reaction". The facial nerves of the experimental group were treated with epineurial coaptation and BMP-2 after the injury. Nerves not treated with BMP-2 were regarded as controls. The expression of BMP-2 was investigated by in situ hybridisation in the neurons of facial nuclei. The electrophysiology, image analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to evaluate the level of the recovery of facial nerves. The results showed that the axons in the experimental group were thicker and denser than those in the control group four weeks later. The expression of BMP-2 in the neurons of facial nuclei increased after injury. The electron microscopic observations showed that the axons' degeneration in the experimental group was less than that in the control group. Despite the morphological difference between the two groups, there was no apparent difference between them in nerve conduction velocity. These findings suggest that BMP-2 might be involved in the regeneration of facial nerves, and might function as a potential neurotrophic factor. © 2006 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

34247360878	Engineering cartilage tissues with the shape of human nasal alar by using chondrocyte macroaggregate-Experiment study in rabbit model	Despite of progresses in tissue engineering based on cell/scaffold strategy, uneven cell distribution as well as tissue formation in the scaffold, limited cell seeding efficiency and inflammatory reaction triggered by the degradation of scaffold remain problems to be resolved. In this study, we proposed a novel cell-macroaggregate cultivation system, and explored a feasible strategy to construct three-dimensional cartilage tissue with shape of human nasal alar by using cell macroaggregate. Isolated chondrocytes was cultured at high density to form a monolayer chondrocyte sheet as well as expanded for seeding on the sheet to produce mechanically operable cell macroaggregate. Chondrocyte macroaggregates were then fabricated into transplants with shape of nasal alar by using Internal support or External scaffold techniques; results of in vivo chondrogenesis were investigated in immunocompetent animal. Chondrocyte macroaggregates presented long survival time and good viability; constructs fabricated using both techniques can develop into tissues with characteristic structure of native cartilage, glycosaminoglycans as well as type II collagen were highly produced in the ECM of engineered cartilages. By placing hyaluronan ester film as Internal support, the predetermined shape of the chondrocyte macroaggregate can be well maintained. In contrast, due to the poor mechanical stability of grafts fabricated in External scaffold group, obvious deformation occurred in harvested specimens. The experiment proved the usefulness of chondrocyte macroaggregate in cartilage regeneration, and provided a new strategy to engineer cartilage with special shape by using cell macroaggregate/biodegradable support. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

34250330004	Histological changes during expansion of the maxillary suture	Aim: To observe the process of tissue response and regeneration in the circum-maxillary sutures under tensile forces. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the laboratory of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Stomatology College, Forth Military Medical University from March to September 2005. Twelve 15-week mongrel dogs were randomly assigned into experimental group (n=8) and control group (n=4). The experimental group was fitted with an extra-oral traction device and a traction hook was exerted from the nasopalatine foramen; a rubber band was used to connect the scaffold and the traction hook and a forward elastic force was exerted with 600 g tensile force. After 1 and 4 weeks, 4 dogs in the experimental group and 2 dogs in the control group were killed respectively to observe the maxillary suture, palatine suture, malomaxillary suture and zygomaticotemporal suture grossly and histologically. Results: All the 12 dogs were involved in the result analysis. (1) The bone formation was found between lateral band and bone margin, and a cyst-like zone appeared between the bony front and the suture connective tissue at the early stage of sutural expansion. Then a great amount of osteoblasts and fibrolasts proliferated. New bone and connective tissue fiber paralleled with the direction of tensile force. (2) Fiber in intermediate zone in suture arranged intensively, and had no markedly changes during sutural expansion, which prevented the sutural bone from fusion. (3) At the early stage of sutural expansion, I and III collogen could be found in suture regions; then the osteoblasts secreted I collogen besides III collogen, and finally, III collogen degradated, which was replaced by I collogen as the main components of bone matrix. II collogen was not found in suture region after picroirius staining. Conclusion: Suture expansion is a process of membrane bone formation without enchondral bone formation. Intermediate zone in suture can prevent fusion of bone as a barrier.

34547626443	Regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation in fibroblasts by exogenous MyoD gene in vitro and in vivo	MyoD of the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) family regulates the skeletal muscle differentiation program. In this study, stably transfected NIH3T3-derived cell lines were established, in which exogenous MyoD was expressed at high levels. Transcriptional activation of endogenous muscle regulatory gene and induction towards the skeletal muscle lineages were observed with phase-contrast microscopy when continuously cultured in vitro. Moreover, to determine their ability of myogenic formation in vivo, the transfected cells were implanted in nude mice subcutaneously for up to 10 weeks. The morphological characterization of inductive cells was observed using transmission electron microscope and histological staining. Myogenesis of fibroblasts incubated in the medium was activated by overexpression of MyoD, and the cells were accumulated and fused into multinucleated myotubes. Correlatively, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased expression of characteristic downstream molecule myogenin and mysion heavy chains during myogenic differentiation. Ecoptic myogenesis was found and remained stable phenotype when the transfected cells were seeded in vivo. Our results suggest that MyoD can be considered to be a determining factor of myogenic lineages, and it may play an important role in the cell therapy and cell-mediated gene therapy of the skeletal muscle. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

3543089185	Development of a sheep model for alveolar ridge augmentation by distraction osteogenesis	Aim: To develop a new experimental model for alveolar ridge augmentation by using no-tooth area and the first premolar area of sheep, and to study the feasibility and availability of this model. Methods: One side of 6 Shaanxi native sheep's mandibular alveolar ridge was chosen randomly as experimental side. Rectangular osteotomy was used in the experimental side of the no-tooth area and the first premolar area, and a vertical distraction apparatus was placed. After a latent period of 7 days, the alveolar ridge had been augmented vertically by distraction for 8 days, the distraction rate was 1.0 mm per day and the distraction frequency was once per day respectively. Then, the retention period continued for 4 or 8 weeks. The effect of distraction osteogenesis was measured by X-ray irradiation, clinical gross and histological observation. Results: The alveolar ridge was vertically augmented 7.5 mm and 7.0 mm on average respectively. The results of X-ray irradiation showed that the interspace in the distraction site disappeared and was filled with new bone tissues in 4 weeks. In 8 weeks, the density of new bone was the same as that of the original alveolar ridge. Histologically, the lengthened bone consisted of mature bone trabecula and cortical bone. The endodontium of the first mandible premolar were normal. Conclusion: The no-tooth area and the first premolar area of mandible in sheep is a good experimental animal model for alveolar ridge augmentation by distraction osteogenesis.

35948957357	Animal model for evaluation of strain gauge in mandibular distraction osteogenesis in rabbits	Aim: To design and assemble a distraction device with a strain gauge, and establish an animal model for testing it during mandibular distraction osteogenesis. Methods: An osteotomy was made in the same position at the junction of mandibular angle and body in 12 rabbits. A customised distraction device attached to a strain gauge was used to distract the mandible. To find out which was the better material, both polyurethane and silicone were used as encapsulation material. After distraction, radiographs were taken, and specimens were examined histologically to record bone formation. Results: Distraction osteogenesis was carried out successfully on all rabbits when the device used polyurethanes as the encapsulation material, it did not transfer the strain signals, but those made with silicone did. Conclusion: The device with silicone used as the encapsulation material can be used for strain-testing during mandibular distraction osteogenesis in a rabbit model. © 2007 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

40149090624	Matrix metalloproteinase and its inhibitor in temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis after indirect trauma in young goats	Our aim was to examine the change in expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-13), matrix metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in the articular cartilage of goats with experimentally-induced osteoarthrosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) at various times. Osteoarthrosis was induced in 20 goats in the bilateral TMJ and 5 goats acted as controls. There were 5 goats in each group, and a group was killed at 7 days, and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. The samples were collected, and the joints evaluated histologically. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the presence of MMPs and TIMP-1 in the articular disc and condylar cartilage. The ultrastructure of the articular disc and condylar surface at 1 month was examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Osteoarthrosis of the TMJ progressed gradually over time. MMP-13, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 were expressed strongly in the TMJ soon after injury; MMP-13 became gradually weakened, and MMP-3 strengthened later. None of these were expressed in the normal condyle. After a month the surface of the arthrotic condyle was uneven, and the underlying collagen fibrils were exposed in irregular fissures on the surface. The secretion of TIMP-1 was related closely to the changes of MMPs during osteoarthrosis of the TMJ. The unbalanced ratio between them caused degradation of the matrix of the cartilage and might be the cause of osteoarthrosis of the TMJ. © 2007 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

40249107466	Selections of the cylinder implant neck taper and implant end fillet for optimal biomechanical properties: A three-dimensional finite element analysis	In this paper, effects of the implant neck taper and the implant-end fillet on the maximum Von Mises stresses were evaluated in jaw bones, and maximum displacements examined in an implant-abutment complex by a finite element method (FEM). The implant-neck tapers (T) ranged from 45° to 70°, and fillets of implant ends (R) ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. Results suggested that under axial load by the maximum Von Mises stresses in cortical and cancellous bones decreased by 71.6% and 14.8%, respectively, and under 45° buccolingual load by 68.2% and 11.0%, respectively. The maximum displacement of implant-abutment complex decreased by 9.1% and 22.8% under axial and 45° buccolingual load, respectively. When T ranged from 64° to 73° and R exceeded 0.8 mm, minimum stress/displacement was obtained and the evaluating targets were more sensitive to T than to R. Data indicated that the taper of implant neck favored stress distribution in cortical bones more than the fillet of implant end did; taper of implant neck affected implant stability more than the fillet of implant end did; and the taper of implant neck of 64-73° and fillet of implant end exceeding 0.8 mm were optimal selections for the type B/2 bone in a cylinder implant by biomechanical consideration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

59449093531	Periodontal tissues changes in tooth-borne distraction osteogenesis: an experimental study of closure of wide alveolar bone defects in dogs	We studied changes in periodontal tissue during maxillary dentoalveolar distraction osteogenesis using an intraoral tooth-borne distractor to close wide alveolar defects in four dogs. The dentoalveolar monofocal transport disc was made by complete horizontal subapical and vertical interdental osteotomy. Gradual distraction was started after a latency period of seven days at the rate of 0.4 mm twice a day. We measured the displacement of the supporting tooth and the anchoring tooth, and took successive radiographs. On days 0, 14, 28, and 70 after distraction, the dentoalveolar segments were harvested for histological examination. There was periodontal hyperplasia in the tissues of the tension side, and absorption in the stress side. In the early period of consolidation, there was inflammation and local destruction of periodontal tissues, but the changes reversed over time. The anchoring tooth was not displaced and the periodontal tissues did not change.

60449106301	Platelet-rich plasma - A promising cell carrier for micro-invasive articular cartilage repair	Due to the limited regenerative capacity of cartilage tissues, articular cartilage defect caused by various lesions remains a problem to be resolved. Tissue engineering provided a valuable alternative to current therapeutic approaches, which is expected to greatly reduce the need of joint replacement. Scaffold, acting as cell carrier, plays an important role in maintaining cells in defect sites, thus facilitates the chondrogenesis. However, an open operation is often needed to implant the cell/scaffold composite, to find a less invasive way to delivering the complex into the defect site would be desirable. Different from synthetic and other nature derived scaffold, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a fraction of plasma which contains multiple growth factors and could be clotted when mixed with thrombin. Therefore, we hypothesized that PRP could be used as an autologous cell carrier to inject and fix chondrocytes into the defect site of articular cartilage. With the assistance of arthroscope, the defect could be precisely located, and injectable PRP-Cell composite would make the operation micro-invasive and simple. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

80052657988	Enhancing bone formation by transplantation of a scaffold-free tissue-engineered periosteum in a rabbit model	Objectives: The periosteum plays an important role in bone regeneration. However, the harvesting of autogenous periosteum is associated with disadvantages such as donor site morbidity and limited donor sources. This study uses an osteogenic predifferentiated cell sheet to fabricate a scaffold-free tissue-engineered periosteum (TEP). Material and methods: We generated an osteogenic predifferentiated cell sheet from rabbit bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) using a continuous culture system and harvested it using a scraping technique. Then, the in vitro characterization of the sheet was investigated using microscopy investigation, quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and RT-PCR. Next, we demonstrated the in vivo osteogenic potential of the engineered sheet in ectopic sites together with a porous β-tricalcium phosphate ceramic. Finally, we evaluated its efficiency in treating delayed fracture healing after wrapping the cell sheet around the mandible in a rabbit model. Results: The engineered periosteum showed sporadic mineralized nodules, elevated ALP activity, and up-regulated gene expression of osteogenic markers. After implantation in the subcutaneous pockets of the donor rabbits, the in vivo bone-forming capability of the engineered periosteum was confirmed by histological examinations. Additionally, when wrapping the engineered periosteum around a mandibular fracture gap, we observed improved bone healing and reduced amounts of fibrous tissue at the fracture site. Conclusion: The osteogenic predifferentiated BMSC sheet can act as a scaffold-free TEP to facilitate bone regeneration. Hence, our study provides a promising strategy for enhancing bone regeneration in clinical settings. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84867821596	Effects of sympathetic innervation loss on mandibular distraction osteogenesis	Sympathetic nerve system has been proved to have important regulative effects to bone mass. However, the role of sympathetic nerve system in distraction osteogenesis (DO) is unclear. Here we show that the sympathetic nerve system plays an important role in mandibular DO. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups at random. Right-side mandibular DO was performed on the 15 rats in control group (group A). Bilateral transection of cervical sympathetic trunk and right-side mandibular DO were performed on the 15 rats in the experimental group (group B). After operation, quantitative general observations, microY computed tomography bone morphology analysis, and hematoxylineosin staining osseous tissue on newosteotylus in distraction gap were performed at consolidation time of 1, 14, and 28 days. SPSS 12.0 software package was used for statistical analysis. At 1 and 14 days of consolidation time, there was more continuous bone formation in the experimental group than that of the control group as determined by gross observation. Bone formation parameters including bone mineral density, bone volumeYtotal volume ratio, bone trabeculae number as determined by micro-CT, and histological study of the test group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05). No significant difference was noted between the 2 groups on consolidation time of 28 days. Our study suggested that the sympathetic innervation loss could improve mandibular DO and new bone formation, and the sympathetic nerve system might negatively regulate the process of DO.

84867457511	Prefabrication of vascularized bone grafts using a combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and vascular bundles with β-tricalcium phosphate ceramics	Objective: Large bone defects are often treated with autologous vascularized bone grafts. These operations may be associated with donor site morbidities and a limited volume of harvested bone. To overcome such issues, we prefabricated vascularized bone grafts using a combination of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and vascular bundles in a β-tricalcium phosphate ceramic (β-TCP). Study Design: We used 15 New Zealand White rabbits as our experimental animals. Single photon-emission computed tomography and histologic analyses were used to evaluate angiogenesis and new bone formation of the bone grafts. Results: The results showed that axial vessels not only promoted angiogenesis of the bone grafts, but also enhanced new bone formation. Conclusion: These findings suggested that the insertion of blood vessels into tissue-engineered bone grafts was an effective strategy for enhancing angiogenesis and bone formation and had potential significance for clinical applications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

47549106163	A comparative study of the skeletal morphology of the temporo-mandibular joint of children and adults	Background: The skeletal morphology of the temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) is constantly remodeled. Aims and Objectives: A comparative study was undertaken to determine and characterize the differences in the skeletal morphology of TMJ of children and adults. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 30 children cadavers and 30 adult volunteers. Parameters that could reflect TMJ skeletal morphology were measured with a new technology combining helical computed tomography (CT) scan with multi-planar reformation (MPR) imaging. Results: Significant differences between children cadavers and adults were found in the following parameters (P < 0.05): Condylar axis inclination, smallest area of condylar neck/largest area of condylar process, inclination of anterior slope in inner, middle, and outer one-third of condyle, anteroposterior/ mediolateral dimension of condyle, length of anterior slope/posterior slope in inner and middle one-third of condyle, anteroposterior dimension of condyle/glenoid fossa, mediolateral dimension of condyle/glenoid fossa, inclination of anterior slope of glenoid fossa, depth of glenoid fossa, and anteroposterior/mediolateral dimension of glenoid fossa. Conclusion: There are significant differences of TMJ skeletal morphology between children and adults.

49049107531	Reconstruction of curved mandibular angle defects using a new internal transport distraction device: an experiment in goats	A new internal distraction device, comprising a square-bodied bow, a transport plate, a traction mechanism, and two stabilisers, was developed to allow transportation of bone around an arc. Eight adult goats were studied. A curved mandibulectomy 3 cm long was made on the mandibular angle. The distractor was implanted to restore the defect. The bone was distracted at a rate of 1 mm per day after a 5-day latent period. Distraction lasted 25 to 32 days. Curvilinear distraction was successful in six of the eight goats. After consolidation periods of four or eight weeks, smooth curved bone masses were restored in the distracted areas. Radiographically, there was considerable bone density in the distraction area and opaque columns streamed in the direction of distraction. Histological examination showed membranous bony regeneration in the restored bone. These results suggest that restoration of curved bone defects using the new internal transport distraction device was feasible in goats. © 2008 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

52949138322	A novel strategy for prefabrication of large and axially vascularized tissue engineered bone by using an arteriovenous loop	The repair of bone defects remains a major clinical challenge because none available reconstruction methods and biomaterials have been proved completely satisfactory. As a promising approach for bone regeneration, tissue engineered bone has become a technically feasible method to repair small to moderate sized bone defects in clinical practice, but it is difficult to repair large one, particularly when the recipient site is scarred by infection or radiation injury. Construction of large and vascularized tissue engineered bone may overcome the problems since vascularization is an essential prerequisite for the constructs to survive and integrate with existing host tissue. On the other hand, prefabrication large artificial bone in vivo bioreactor and axial vascularization by means of arteriovenous loop model in soft tissue have been proved to be feasible. Therefore, we hypothesize that combination of cells, solid scaffold, growth factors, and arteriovenous loop may eventually generate a large and vascularized tissue engineered bone flap in vivo bioreactor. Like vascularized autologous bone grafts, the new constructs could be transferred to the defect site by using microsurgical techniques. The strategy would facilitate clinical translation in bone tissue engineering and offer new therapeutic strategies for reconstruction of extended bone defects if the hypothesis proved to be practical. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

53649083773	Preliminary Study of Fibrin Glue Combined With Pingyangmycin for the Treatment of Venous Malformations in the Oral and Maxillofacial Region	Purpose: To observe the outcome of using fibrin glue (FG) combined with Pingyangmycin (Tianjin Taihe Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Tianjin, China) in the treatment of venous malformations (VMs) in the oral and maxillofacial region. Materials and Methods: The treatment data of 7 patients with VMs from January 2005 to January 2006 were reviewed. All these patients were injected with FG combined with Pingyangmycin. The vital signs and symptoms were observed and recorded immediately after injections. Radiographic examination was used for the evaluation of pulmonary conditions. The therapeutic effect was evaluated by clinical examination and Doppler ultrasonography. The follow-up time was from 1 to 2 years. Results: Of the 7 patients, 4 were male and 3 were female, with ages ranging from 10 to 62 years. Four of the 7 recovered to near-normal appearance, without any abnormal bloodstream detectable within the lesions. Two lesions were slightly asymmetrical in appearance, but no abnormal bloodstream could be detected in the lesions. Two patients had a fever during treatment, and one of them stopped treatment because of continuous high fever. No allergic reactions, pulmonary embolisms, or other complications were found during or after treatment. Conclusion: The therapeutic modality of FG combined with Pingyangmycin for VMs in the oral and maxillofacial region was effective, and the extent of morbidity was acceptable. However, the further long-term observation of severe complications such as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism should be performed in additional biological and clinical studies. © 2008 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

57149092998	Cyclic stretch induced miR-146a upregulation delays C2C12 myogenic differentiation through inhibition of Numb	Proliferation and differentiation of muscle stem cells must be tightly regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals for effective regeneration and adaptive response. MicroRNAs have been implicated as potent regulators in diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. In this study, we found that miR-146a was significantly upregulated upon a 48-h cyclic stretch of 5% elongation/10cycles/min. Importantly, miR-146 was predicted to base-pair with sequences in the 3′ UTR of Numb, which promotes satellite cell differentiation towards muscle cells by inhibiting Notch signaling. Through reporter assay and exogenous expression experiment, we confirmed Numb was inhibited by miR-146a. Inhibition of miR-146a by antago-miR-146a rescued the expression of Numb and facilitated the differentiation of C2C12 at a cost of compromised proliferation. Thus, for the first time, we propose a role of miR-146a in skewing the balance of muscle differentiation and proliferation through inhibiting the expression of Numb. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

60849121403	Plasma exchange therapy holds promise in the management of advanced cancer	Cancer is now emerging as the second most common cause of death worldwide. Currently the most widely used treatments for solid cancer are surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy, all of which are of limited effects in improvement of the survival. It is well-established that circulating factors are involved in the development of cancer. And plasma exchange is a well-established therapeutic procedure commonly used in many autoimmune diseases through the elimination of pathologic mediators, including auto-antibodies, complement components, and cytokines. Thus, we hypothesize that plasma exchange therapy alone or in combination with the routine therapeutics should be considered as an alternative for the present treatments. Future clinical studies are needed to validate the hypothesis. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

60149103667	Customized design of artificial mandible substitutes based on Boolean operation	To make the mandible substitutes remain ideal characters, a customized design of the mandible reconstruction based on the Boolean operation was proposed. The medical CT scan was used to obtain the original bone data to facilitate a prosthesis design. STL data format was adopted throughout the design process to avoid a format distortion due to data conversion and to ensure that the shape of the prosthesis and the original bone matched, which suggested it possible that the substitute spatial location was performed according to the free surface of human bone. This design scheme enable the mandible substitute to possess a specific shape, a correct relative position and a precise connection with a shape matching the original bone perfectly.

64749086353	A new hypothesis of mechanisms of traumatic ankylosis of temporomandibular joint	Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is a disease that severely affects the human health. Although it is well known that trauma is the most common cause of TMJ ankylosis, the mechanisms by which the traumatic TMJ ankylosis develops are unclear. The existing hypothesis is not convincing in explaining the genesis of traumatic TMJ ankylosis. We make a hypothesis that the distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the lateral pterygoid muscle combining with the dislocated and damaged disc is an important factor in genesis of traumatic TMJ ankylosis. If this hypothesis is verified, it will be helpful for the prevention of traumatic TMJ ankylosis and change the principle of management of sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle (SFMC). © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67349087689	Morphological evaluation of temporomandibular joint after open and closed treatment of type B diacapsular condylar fractures in sheep	The incidence of diacapsular fracture of the mandibular condyle (DFMC) has increased in recent years. However, the specific modality of treatment which would provide maximum benefit and good results for adult patients of DFMC has been controversial. To evaluate and compare morphological changes of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) after open and closed treatments for DFMC, a sheep model of a type B DFMC was created by osteotomy. Eight sheep models of type B DFMC were randomly divided into 2 groups to receive closed treatment (Group 1) and open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF, Group 2), respectively, and morphological changes of TMJ were scored according to the radiological and anatomical criteria of scoring and compared between the 2 groups. Compared with Group 1 animals treated by the closed method, Group 2 animals treated with ORIF received significantly lower scores for morphological changes 12 weeks after treatment. We conclude that ORIF is more efficient than the closed functional treatment in restoring morphology of TMJ to treat type B DFMC. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The transgingival height ranged from 1.0-4.0 mm. Under axial load, the maximum equivalent stress in the cortical bone could be reduced by up to 4.7%, and under a buccolingual load, the maximum equivalent stresses in the cortical and the cancellous bones could be reduced by 17.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The maximum displacement of the implant-abutment complex could be reduced by 4.1% and 48.9% under axial and buccolingual loads, respectively. When the transgingival height was in the range of 1.7-2.8 mm, there was minimum stress in the jaw bones and minimum displacement in the implant-abutment complex. Data indicated that transgingival height played a more important part in protecting a dental implant under a buccolingual load than under an axial load; and transgingival heights ranging from 1.7-2.8 mm were biomechanically optimal for a screwed implant. © 2008 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

67349260729	Optimization of the implant diameter and length in type B/2 bone for improved biomechanical properties: A three-dimensional finite element analysis	In this paper, effects of the implant diameter and length on the maximum equivalent stresses were evaluated in jaw bones, and maximum displacements examined in an implant-abutment complex by a finite element method. The implant diameter ranged from 3.0 mm to 5.0 mm, and implant length ranged from 6.0 mm to 16.0 mm. Results suggested that under axial load, the maximum equivalent stresses in cortical and cancellous bones decreased by 77.4% and 68.4% with the increasing of diameter and length respectively. Under buccolingual load, those decreased by 64.9% and 82.8%, respectively. The maximum displacements of implant-abutment complex decreased by 56.9% and 78.2% under axial and buccolingual load respectively. When the diameter exceeded 3.9 mm and the length exceeded 9.5 mm, the minimum stress/displacement was obtained. The evaluating targets were more sensitive to the diameter change than that of the length. Data indicated that the implant diameter affected stress distribution in jaw bone more than length did; and an implant diameter exceeding 3.9 mm and implant length exceeding 9.5 mm was the optimal selection for type B/2 bone in a cylinder implant by biomechanical considerations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

68749117499	Diagnosis and surgical treatment of carotid body tumors: 25 years' experience in China	Carotid body tumors (CBT) are rare neoplasms arising from the small chemoreceptor organ in the adventitia of the common carotid bifurcation. A retrospective survey was conducted in 33 patients, treated by curative resection of the neoplasm, from 1980 to 2005, to investigate clinical features, preoperative treatment and surgical approach, and determine the optimum management for CBT. The demographic characteristics, clinical features, surgical approach and complications were documented and analyzed. Accurate diagnosis and effective preoperative training were associated with a good surgical outcome. Carotid arteriography accurately diagnoses and evaluates the brain's collateral circulation in the circle of Willis. Ultrasonography is useful. Carotid blood flow obstruction (Matas' training) is effective. Complete excision of the carotid system without a vascular replacement is possible only after reliable Matas' training and objective observation of the establishment of circulation in the circle of Willis. Correct treatment of the internal and common carotid artery is important to reduce postoperative complications. The continuity of the common and internal carotid artery should be retained if possible, and carotid artery repair is recommended. Minor complications occurred in five (15%) patients and one patient died from a cause not related to the CBT at follow-up. © 2009 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

An additional objective is to assess injury patterns associated with 2 types of roofing structures found in this region of China. Methods: This descriptive study included data on trauma patients at 8 hospitals in Jiangyou for the 14 days immediately after the earthquake. The patients were either from Jiangyou County, which experienced a modified Mercalli intensity level of VIII, or from Beichuan County (Mercalli intensity level of X). Of the 5,775 earthquake-related injuries, 1,484 (25.7%) involved the head and were classified into 4 categories. Seven injury mechanisms were also analyzed to determine the association with the 4 types of head injuries. Results: Scalp injuries (43%) were the most common type of head injuries, followed by facial injuries, 482 (32%), intracranial injuries, 218 (15%), and skull fractures, 117 (8%). Differences in injury type and cause were apparent, with scalp injuries being more common (49%) in Jiangyou than in Beichuan (30%) and falling clay tiles contributing more (40%) to this injury in the former city than the latter (6%). In contrast, precast concrete plank roofing caused 20% of scalp injuries in Beichuan compared with 3% in Jiangyou. Conclusion: Scalp injuries were the most common head injury type. Falling clay roofing tiles and precast concrete plank roofs are important injury mechanisms, and their contribution may reflect differences in building construction. © 2009 American College of Emergency Physicians.

Methods: Thirty-six rats were divided into 5 groups: corticotomy-assisted tooth movement (CO + TM), sham corticotomy without tooth movement (CO alone), osteotomy-assisted tooth movement (OS + TM), sham osteotomy without tooth movement (OS alone), and unassisted tooth movement (TM alone). Standard orthodontic springs were activated to produce mesial tooth movement. The rats were killed at 3, 21, and 60 days after activation for osteoclast and blood vessel counts, and immunostaining with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and osteocalcin were performed. Results: The CO + TM group had significantly more osteoclasts at 3 days (P <0.005) compared with the OS + TM group. The alveolar bone surrounding the dental roots was replaced with multicellular tissue at 21 days in the CO + TM group but was intact in the OS + TM group with the exception of a distal distraction site. At day 21, immunostaining with PCNA, TGF beta 1, VEGF, and osteocalcin occurred at the mesial border of bone in the CO + TM group, whereas a diffuse pattern was observed in the distal distraction sites at 21 and 60 days in the OS + TM group. Conclusions: Corticotomy-assisted tooth movement produced transient bone resorption around the dental roots under tension; this was replaced by fibrous tissue after 21 days and by bone after 60 days. Osteotomy-assisted tooth movement resembled distraction osteogenesis and did not pass through a stage of regional bone resorption. © 2009 American Association of Orthodontists.

77649217768	Enhanced treatment of articular cartilage defect of the knee by intra-articular injection of Bcl-xL-engineered mesenchymal stem cells in rabbit model	Direct intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been proposed as a potential cell therapy for cartilage defects. This cell therapy relies on the survival of the implanted MSCs. However, the arduous local environment may limit cell viability after implantation, which would restrict the cells' regenerative capacity. Thus, it is necessary to reinforce the implanted cells against the unfavourable microenvironment in order to improve the efficacy of cell therapy. We examined whether the transduction of an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xL, into MSCs could prevent cell death and improve the implantation efficiency of MSCs in a rabbit model. Our current findings demonstrate that the group treated with Bcl-xL-engineered MSCs could improve cartilage healing both morphologically and histologically when compared with the controls. These results suggest that intra-articular injection of Bcl-xL-engineered MSCs is a potential non-invasive therapeutic method for effectively treating cartilage defects of the knee.

77949835790	Engineering scaffold-free bone tissue using bone marrow stromal cell sheets	The use of exogenous scaffolds to engineer bone tissue faces several drawbacks including insufficient biological activity, potential immunogenicity, elevated inflammatory reaction, fluctuating degradation rate, and low cell-attachment efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, we sought to engineer large scaffold-free bone tissue using cell sheets. We harvested intact cell sheets from bone marrow stromal cells using a continuous culture method and a scraping technique. The cell sheets were then rolled and fabricated into large constructs. Finally, the constructs were implanted into the subcutaneous pockets of nude mice. The cells within the sheet maintained in vitro osteogenic potential after osteoblast differentiation. Computed tomography scans and histological examination confirmed new bone formation in vivo. Additionally, the engineered bone exhibited enhanced compressive strength. Our results indicate that the BMSC sheets can facilitate the formation of functional three-dimensional bone tissue without the use of exogenous scaffolds. Hence, the study provides an intriguing alternative strategy for bone repair. © 2009 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A preauricular approach was used to expose the fracture. A temporary screw was used to assist in the anatomical reduction, and a lateral lag screw in combination with a lateral position screw was used for internal rigid fixation. Six adult patients with sagittal condylar fractures and more than 5 mm condylar height shortening were treated. The treatment outcomes were followed up clinically and radiographically for 8-27 months (mean 18 months) postoperatively. There were no complications associated with the operation. All patients recovered favorably with good occlusion, normal movement of the mandible, correct repositioning and rigid fixation of the fragment of the fracture and a good condyle shape on radiographs. The temporary and lateral screw technique is a simple, effective, fast, and minimally invasive surgical treatment for adult sagittal condylar fractures. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

77953364061	Research on a Novel Rigid Internal Fixation System	Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency of fixation with a novel (bulge core type system) rigid internal fixation system. Materials and Methods: Mandibular linear fractures were created artificially in dogs and fixed using a bulge core type system or a miniplate system in vitro. A 3-point load cell was used to contrast the fixation strength of the 2 systems in vitro. Histologic sections were used to analyze the healing of mandibular linear fractures and to contrast the efficiency of fixation of the 2 systems in vivo. Tetracycline-fluorescein staining technology was used to evaluate the bone healing speed in the mandibular fracture lines during bone healing. Results: In vitro, the 3-point load cell showed that the fixation strength of the bulge core type system was greater than that of the miniplate system (P < .05). In vivo, the histologic sections and tetracycline-fluorescein staining showed that greater and quicker bony healing occurred using the bulge core type system (P < .05) and that the efficiency of fixation of the 2 systems was similar. Conclusion: Our results have shown that the bulge core type system can provide sufficient strength for mandibular linear fracture healing. Crown Copyright © 2010.

77955227399	Reconstruction of rabbit critical-size calvarial defects using autologous bone marrow stromal cell sheets	The reconstruction of bone defects remains a significant clinical problem. In this study, we constructed cell sheet from bone marrow stromal cells on normal culture plates by a simple method. The cell sheets showed evident mineralized nodules, high alkaline phosphatase activities, indicating their in vitro osteogenic potential. Then its osteogenic capability to heal critical-size rabbit calvarial defect was investigated. Forty adult New Zealand White rabbits were randomly divided into 4 groups of 10 animals each: (1) empty, (2) demineralized bone matrix (DBM) alone, (3) DBM/cell suspension, and (4) DBM/cell sheet. Specimens were harvested 6 and 12 weeks after implantation, respectively. Radiographic, histologic, and histomorphometric analyses were performed to evaluate the new bone formation inside the defect. The results revealed that the defect treated with DBM/cell sheet showed significantly more bone formation than other 3 groups (P < 0.05). Our study indicates that the cell sheet enhances bone regeneration in healing critical-size rabbit calvarial defect, and cell sheet-based engineered bone might be considered as potential substitutes for bone reconstruction.

The implant thread height ranged from 0.20 to 0.60. mm, and the thread width ranged from 0.10 to 0.40. mm. Compared to those in standard designed implants, the maximum Von Mises stresses in cortical and cancellous bones with axially loaded implants decreased by 18.85% and 47.46%, respectively, and by 16.38% and 63.46%, respectively in buccolingually loaded implants. The maximum displacement of implant-abutment complex loaded axially and buccolingually decreased by 13.78% and 6.97%, respectively. These results indicated that thread height played more important roles in affecting bone stresses and implant-abutment complex stability than thread width. Immediately loaded cylinder implants with thread height exceeding 0.44. mm and width ranging from 0.19 to 0.23. mm caused the lowest stresses to the type B/2 bone. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the therapeutic effect for the correction and treatment is not satisfactory due to varied abnormality and difficult plans. OBJECTIVE: To discuss the feasibility of manufacturing underlay for the treatment of hemifacial atrophy using computer-assisted design and rapid prototyping technology. METHODS: Skull of the hemifacial atrophy patient was scanned with Picker 6000 SCT, and the data obtained were processed in Voxel Q image workstation for 3-D reconstruction with volume rendering technique. After the interval lamination, the images were downloaded at 0.4-mm interval in a BMP format using CuteFTP 4.0 software. Then the transaxial 2-D image data were converted into digitized 2-D contour data by using image processing software developed by experimental team through a series of processes, including filtering, screening, noise reduction, and distortion correction. The edges and contour of the images was extracted to obtain a vector diagram of facial cranial cortical bone contour line. The digitized data were inputted into image processing software of Surfacer 9.0 for vector superposing, thus the 3-D wire frame and solid images of skull could be reconstructed. According to mirror-image symmetry relation, the point-cloud data of facial bone on the normal side was duplicated to the atrophied side. Thus a 3-D model of the underlay was produced between the atrophied bone and the mirror image of normal side. In order to compensate the atrophy of soft tissues, the model was designed 1.5 mm thicker. After the three-dimensional Surfacer data on the CAD were re-stratified, the contour editing of the underlay and the supporting set of prototype were completed in RpDataRepare, forming RP files and creating underlay template through rapidly output of the processing file for rapid prototyping required, as a reference of surgical procedures. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 3-D solid model of the patient skull bone surface contour was obtained and simulacrum of the underlay was prepared with computer assistance and rapid prototyping. According to the simulacrum, the operation was carried out and got a satisfactory result. The manufacture of underlay for the treatment of hemifacial atrophy could be accomplished by computer assisted design and rapid prototyping in a highly precise and rapid manner. It is a promising technique in the field of individualized underlay making in craniofacial surgery.

77955984688	Veterinary and radiological evaluations of open and closed treatment of type B diacapitular (intracapsular) fractures of the mandibular condyle in sheep	The incidence of diacapitular (intracapsular) fractures of the mandibular condyle has increased in recent years, but their treatment remains inadequate, particularly of type B fractures. To evaluate and compare outcomes of open and closed treatments we created a sheep model of a type B fracture through an osteotomy. Eight sheep were randomly divided into two groups of four each to be given closed treatment or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and were evaluated by veterinary and radiological examinations. Compared with before the osteotomy, there were significant reductions in maximum mouth opening (MMO) and left movement in the closed group, but no significant differences in the range of jaw movements in the ORIF group after 12 weeks of treatment. The two radiological scores that indicated the degree of osteoarthrotic changes and ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in the ORIF group were significantly lower than those in the closed group. Anatomical observation confirmed the pathological changes in the right TMJ in the closed group and adaptive changes in the ORIF group. We conclude that ORIF is more efficient than closed treatment in restoring the function and shape of the TMJ to after a type B diacapitular condylar fracture. © 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

77956641095	Accurate reconstruction of discontinuous mandible using a reverse engineering/computer-aided design/rapid prototyping technique: A preliminary clinical study	Purpose: To improve the reconstructive surgical outcome of a discontinuous mandibular defect, we used reverse engineering (RE), computer-aided design (CAD), and rapid prototyping (RP) technique to fabricate customized mandibular trays to precisely restore the mandibular defects. Autogenous bone grafting was also used to restore the bony continuity for occlusion rehabilitation. Patients and Methods: Six patients who had undergone block resection of the mandible underwent reconstruction using a custom titanium tray combining autogenous iliac grafts. The custom titanium tray was made using a RE/CAD/RP technique. A virtual 3-dimensional model was obtained by spiral computed tomography scanning. The opposite side of the mandible was mirrored to cover the defect area to restore excellent facial symmetry. A bone grafting tray was designed from the mirrored image and manufactured using RP processing and casting. The mandibular defects were restored using the trays in combination of autologous iliac grafting. An implant denture was made for 1 of the 6 patients at 24 weeks postoperatively for occlusion rehabilitation. Results: The trays fabricated using this technique fit well in all 6 patients. The reconstructive procedures were easy and time saving. Satisfactory facial symmetry was restored. No severe complications occurred in the 5 patients without occlusion rehabilitation during a mean 50-month follow-up period. The reconstruction in the patient with occlusion lasted for only 1 year and failed eventually because of bone resorption and infection. Conclusions: Mandibular reconstruction was facilitated using the RE/CAD/RP technique. Satisfactory esthetic results were achieved. However, the rigidity of the cast tray could cause severe stress shielding to the grafts, which could lead to disuse atrophy. Therefore, some modification is needed for functional reconstruction. © 2010 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

77958085766	CAD/CAM surface templates as an alternative to the intermediate wafer in orthognathic surgery	Objective: A new simple technique using a pair of surface templates fabricated by CAD/CAM technique as an alternative to the use of intermediate surgical wafer is presented. Study design: A patient with transverse maxillary cant and maxillary midline deviation was scanned using computed tomography (CT) to create a 3D model of the maxillofacial bone. Eight virtual cylindrical markers were placed on the selected locations of maxilla. Subsequently, the locations of these cylinders were expressed as drill holes in the preosteotomy templates. The maxillary segment was separated and repositioned in the computer according to preoperative plans. Postosteotomy surface templates were then designed and resin templates were fabricated by a rapid prototyping machine. After investing and casting, metal templates were fabricated. At the beginning of operation, surgical fixation holes on the maxilla were drilled with the preosteotomy templates. Once maxillary osteotomy and segmentation were finished, screws were placed through the holes in the postosteotomy templates into the predrilled holes on the bone correspondingly, and maxillary segments were fixed with the titanium plates. Results: After the postosteotomy templates were positioned and fixed, the maxillary segment was placed to the desired position. Maxillary transverse cant and midline deviation were corrected as the preoperative plan and simulation. Conclusion: The use of the surface templates before and after osteotomy as an alternative to intermediate wafer in orthognathic surgery can minimize labor and errors contained in the traditional way, reducing preoperative work as well as a reduction in operation time. © 2010 Mosby, Inc.

79955034381	Reconstruction of mandibular defects using a custom-made titanium tray in combination with autologous cancellous bone	Purpose: To esthetically and functionally restore a 40-mm canine mandibular discontinuity defect using a custom-made titanium bone-grafting tray packed with autologous iliac bone. Materials and Methods: Individualized titanium bone-grafting trays were made using a reverse engineering, computer-aided design, and rapid prototyping technique. A 40-mm discontinuity defect in the right mandibular body was created in 10 hybrid dogs. The defect was restored immediately using the tray that was densely packed with autologous cancellous iliac particles and covered with trimmed iliac chips. Sequential radionuclide bone imaging was performed postoperatively at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. The ratio of activity between the grafted mandible and the contralateral native mandible on each transaxial slice was calculated. The mean activity ratio was analyzed at each time point to evaluate the bone metabolism and reconstitution of the grafts. The subjects were sacrificed at 4, 12, and 24 weeks after grafting. The specimens were evaluated by postmortem gross dissection, biomechanical testing, 3-dimensional microcomputed tomographic scanning, and histologic examination. Results: All the subjects tolerated the grafting operation well. Over an observation period of 24 weeks, tray extrusion occurred in 3 of the 10 subjects. Bony continuities were reconstructed in 9 of the 10 subjects. Radionuclide bone imaging revealed that the tracer uptake increased in the grafted mandible, and the radionuclide ratio between the graft and the native mandible decreased with time. Gross evaluation, microcomputed tomographic examination, biomechanical testing, and histologic examination demonstrated corticalization of the grafts. Conclusions: The use of a customized technique using reverse engineering, computer-aided design, and rapid prototyping tray containing autologous cancellous bone is a potentially powerful grafting technique for the reconstruction of mandibular discontinuity defects. © 2011 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

79957802940	Engineering injectable bone using bone marrow stromal cell aggregates	With the increasing popularity of minimally invasive surgery, to develop an injectable bone would be highly preferable for the repair of bone nonunions and defects. However, the use of dissociated cells and exogenous carriers to construct injectable bone faces several drawbacks. To circumvent these limitations, we first harvested a cell sheet from rabbit bone marrow stromal cells using a continuous culture method and a scraping technique. The obtained sheet was then cut into fragments of multicellular aggregates, each of which was composed of a certain number of cells, extracellular matrix, and intercellular connections. The aggregates showed apparent mineralization properties, high alkaline phosphatase activity, increased osteocalcin content, and upregulated bone markers, implying their in vitro osteogenic potential. Then, serum-free medium (the control group), dissociated cell suspension (the cell group), and suspension of multicellular aggregates (the aggregate group) were injected subcutaneously on the back of the nude mice to evaluate ectopic bone formation. The results revealed that the aggregate group showed significantly larger and denser bone at the injection sites than the cell group, whereas bone formation did not occur in the control group. Additionally, when injecting them locally into the mandibular fracture gap of delayed healing in a rabbit model, we observed the most improved bone healing in the aggregate group. More cells survive and retain at the injection sites in the aggregate group than that in the cell group postoperatively. Our study indicates that the multicellular aggregates might be considered a promising strategy to generate injectable bone tissue and improve the efficacy of cell therapy. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

80053567785	Review of ectodermal dysplasia: Case report on treatment planning and surgical management of oligodontia with implant restorations	Dental implants have proven to be a reliable modality for the rehabilitation of missing teeth. However, there are limited reports on managing anodontia related to ectodermal dysplasia in the scientific literature. The severely reduced bone quantity due to the congenital absence of multiple natural teeth is the biggest challenge for the surgeon. There are a variety of bone augmentation procedures to establish adequate bone quantity, and the surgical planning should be used on an individual case basis. This is a report of a 19-year-old male patient affected by hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. Oligodontia associated with severe atrophy of jaws was the chief complaint for seeking treatment. Based on clinical and radiographic examinations, 2 bone augmentation procedures were used to obtain sufficient width of alveolus for implant placement by performing an onlay bone graft in the maxilla and vertical distraction osteogenesis in the mandible. The treatment planning was discussed and informed consent was obtained. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

82955249180	Sliding reconstruction of the condyle using posterior border of mandibular ramus in patients with temporomandibular joint ankylosis	The traditional approach for ankylosis is gap arthroplasty or interpositional arthroplasty followed by reconstruction of the condyle using, for example, costochondral grafts. As these are non-pedicled grafts, there is eventual resorption with subsequent decrease in height of the ramus, facial asymmetry and deviated mouth opening. The authors have applied the method of total and partial sliding vertical osteotomy on the posterior border of the mandibular ramus for reconstruction of the mandible condyle as a pedicled graft for the correction of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis. From 2004 to 2008, 18 patients who were diagnosed with TMJ ankylosis underwent operations for resection of the ankylosed condyle. Two methods were performed depending on the level of osteotomy on the posterior part of the mandibular ramus. All patients were followed-up for an average of 36 months (range 24-48 months). All patients showed apparent improved joint function with no cases of re-ankylosis. The results showed that sliding vertical osteotomy on the posterior border of the mandibular ramus seems to be an alternative and promising method for condylar reconstruction in patients with TMJ bony ankylosis. © 2011 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84857235068	Use of a new curvilinear distractor to repair mandibular defects in dogs	We have investigated the feasibility of using a new curvilinear distractor to repair mandibular defects in 6 mature male dogs. A mandibular defect was created by an oblique osteotomy between the distal planes of the bilateral second premolars, and a transport disc 10 mm wide was made. After a 7-day latency period, distraction was activated at 0.5 mm/12 h and consolidation lasted for 6 or 12 weeks. Three dogs were killed after 6 and 12 weeks' consolidation for gross, radiographic, and histological observations to be made. Curvilinear distraction osteogenesis was successful in 5/6 animals. At both time points smooth curved bone had been restored in the distracted areas, and radiographic and histological examination showed that the generated bone was similar to normal bone after 12 weeks' consolidation. These results suggest that the curvilinear distractor could complete curvilinear distraction osteogenesis in dogs' mandibles. © 2011 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84860653511	Modified internal mandibular distraction osteogenesis in the treatment of micrognathia secondary to temporomandibular joint ankylosis: 4-Year follow-up of a case	Micrognathia and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) are problems subsequent to temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJa) in growing patients. For patients with micrognathia and OSAS secondary to TMJa, it is important to restore proper mandibular form and dimension, achieve occlusal stability and recover satisfactory joint movement. We report a 4-year follow-up of a patient with micrognathia and OSAS secondary to bilateral TMJa. The treatment of this patient involved (1) a modified internal mandibular distraction osteogenesis without altering the pre-existing occlusion; (2) TMJ arthroplasty in which the dislocated disc was found and repositioned and the shape of the glenoid fossa and articular head was formed without removing bone in vertical dimension; (3) passive mouth-opening exercise with an individualized occlusal pad postoperatively for one month; and (4) orthodontic treatment for the occlusal disturbance and active mouth-opening exercise for one year. After the treatment the micrognathia was corrected; the oropharyngeal airway was increased significantly; mouth-opening increased to 40 mm intraoperatively was maintained at 36.66 mm 4 years after surgery. Satisfactory occlusion was achieved after orthodontic treatment. Through the 4-year follow-up, no signs of reankylosis were found. In conclusion, this new clinical protocol is a safe, effective and quick way to treat micrognathia and OSAS secondary to TMJa. © 2011 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

84862576858	Local injection of nerve growth factor via a hydrogel enhances bone formation during mandibular distraction osteogenesis	Objective. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the injectable NGF-carrying collagen/nano-hydroxyapatite/alginate hydrogel on the bone formation in a rabbit mandibular distraction osteogenesis model. Study design. Thirty-five New Zealand white rabbits underwent bilateral madibular distraction osteogenesis at a rate of 0.75 mm/12 h for 6 days. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups: group 1 received injections of collagen/ nanohydroxyapatite/ alginate hydrogel containing hNGFβ groups 2, 3, and 4 received injections of hNGFβ, Col/nHA/Alg hydrogel, and saline, respectively. The injections were performed on both sides of the mandible at the end of the lengthening phase. All the animals were killed at a consolidation time of 14 days. Results. No difference in regenerate bone dimensions was observed among the 4 groups. Bone mineral density, the maximum load, and the bone volume/total volume of the new bone in the distraction gap in group 1 was significantly greater (P 1< .05) than in the other 3 groups. Conclusions. Application of the Col/nHA/Alg hydrogel as an NGF delivery during the consolidation phase of distraction osteogenesis increased regeneration and new bone formation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862120044	Use of an internal bidirectional distractor to elongate goats' mandibles	We investigated the feasibility of using an internal bidirectional mandibular distractor to elongate the mandibular bodies and rami of 4 mature male goats. An osteotomy was made at the right mandibular angle and the distractor placed within the osteotomy and allowed to heal in place for 5 days. The mandibles were simultaneously distracted vertically and horizontally at a rate of 0.5 mm/day for 30 days. After a 12-week consolidation period, all the goats were killed for gross, radiographic, and histological evaluation. Smooth new bone had been restored in the distracted area after 12 weeks' consolidation, and the gross, radiographic, and histological evaluations showed that the new bone was similar to the native bone. These results suggest that the internal bidirectional distractor could permit bidirectional distraction osteogenesis in a goat model. © 2011 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84862204824	Prototyped flexible grafting tray for reconstruction of mandibular defects	In our previous studies, prototyped individual bone-grafting trays have been used to restore discontinuous mandibular defects. However, the attempts have shown that the trays have shielded the graft from stress, which caused considerable resorption of bone. To eliminate the shielding, we designed a flexible tray. Finite element analysis was used to compare the distribution of strain on the bone grafts that were placed in flexible and conventional trays. The analogue computation suggested that most of the strain on the graft in the flexible tray resulted in a beneficial mechanical environment, while in the conventional tray more than half of graft was in the lowest class of strain (disuse - <50 μstrains). Animal experiments were conducted on hybrid dogs, and the prototype flexible tray was used to carry particles of autologous cancellous iliac bone to reconstruct a 40 mm defect in the mandibular body. Sequential radionuclide bone imaging was used to monitor the bone metabolism. Animals were killed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks, and specimens processed for quantitative histological examination. The data from the flexible trays were compared with those from the conventional trays, as in our previous study. The results showed that bone metabolism was more active in the flexible tray than in the conventional tray during the early stages. There was increased bony adaptation in the flexible tray. These results indicate that the flexible tray can efficiently eliminate the shielding from stress, and allow more occlusive force to be conducted on to the bone graft, which results in better remodelling of the graft. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84862908627	Notch1 signaling pathway participates in cancer invasion by regulating MMPs in lingual squamous cell carcinoma	Some studies show the Notch signaling pathway may participate in carcinoma invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which Notch1 mediates cell invasion and migration, especially in lingual squamous cell carcinoma, are not yet known. In the current study, we demonstrated for the first time the anti-invasion and anti-metastasis effect of down-regulation of Notch1 in lingual squamous cell carcinoma. Down-regulation of Notch1 could be an effective approach for inhibition of the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 resulting in the inhibition of invasion and metastasis, which could be useful for devising novel preventive and therapeutic strategies for lingual squamous cell carcinoma.

84864644498	Effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy on rapid tissue expansion in rabbits	Background: Tissue expansion has been widely used to provide additional soft tissue for clinical reconstruction. Rapid expansion requires a much shorter clinical period than conventional expansion; however, less natural skin growth occurs resulting in a larger stretch-back ratio and insufficient extra soft tissue for clinical use. In this study, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) was used in the inflation phase of rapid expansion to increase natural skin growth. Methods: Twelve rabbits were divided into two groups. Each group received rapid expander inflation every day. One group received HBOT and the other did not. Blood flow in the expanded skin of each rabbit was assayed in the 10-day inflation phase. After the inflation phase, a rectangular expanded flap of each rabbit was harvested. The instant stretch-back ratio, tension, weight and histological characteristics of the flaps were evaluated. Results: (1) After the second inflation day, the mean blood flow of the HBOT group became significantly higher than that of the control with each day (P < 0.05). At the last day, the blood flow of the HBOT group increased to 131 ± 17 pu, while the control group decreased to 35 ± 5 pu. (2) The mean instant stretch-back ratio of the HBOT group under no-tension conditions was 29 ± 4%, which was significantly less than that of the control group, 46 ± 3% (P < 0.01). (3) The mean flap tension of the HBOT group was 15.3000 ± 1.47648 g and 12.9833 ± 0.73598 g in the transverse and longitudinal axis, respectively, both significantly smaller than that of the control group (33.9167 ± 4.78390 g and 26.5000 ± 2.45031 g, respectively) (P < 0.01). (4) Mean per unit flap weight of the HBOT group was 0.221 ± 0.005 g cm

84865205332	Platelet-rich plasma promotes angiogenesis of prefabricated vascularized bone graft	The objective was to assess the impact of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on angiogenesis and bone formation of tissue-engineered bone in the prefabricated stage. Both thighs of New Zealand white rabbits were used as prefabricated vascularized bone grafts using a combination of bone mesenchymal stem cells and vascular bundles in a titanium cage filled with β-tricalcium phosphate ceramic. PRP was applied in the test group, and the same procedure was performed in the control group without the application of PRP. After 4, 8, and 12 weeks, delayed static bone scanning with technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate was performed before sacrifice, and the tissue-engineered bone samples were collected for immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal antibody against CD31 and histologic analysis. The results showed superior angiogenesis in the PRP group compared with the control group at each time point as determined by bone scintigraphy and immunohistochemical examinations. The results of histologic analysis also showed that there was more bone formation in the PRP group than in the control group at each time point. The application of autologous PRP was an effective strategy for increasing angiogenesis and bone formation in tissue-engineered bone and had potential significance for clinical applications.

84865967955	Segmental curvilinear distraction osteogenesis	Curvilinear distraction is currently under investigation to reconstruct curved maxillofacial bone defects. However, previous studies have revealed the discrepancy between the contour of the regenerated bone in the distraction gap and the curvilinear pathway of the transport disc. We hypothesize that the discrepancy is because of the conflict of the distraction vector and the strain vector during the consolidation. In curvilinear distraction osteogenesis, the distraction vector varies, while the strain vector during the consolidation phase is fixed-linear, from the beginning to the end of the distraction pathway. Here we bring forward a solution of segmental curvilinear distraction osteogenesis to divide the curvilinear distraction into several segments, with respective consolidation for each distraction gap. If this hypothesis is verified, the segmental distraction curvilinear distraction will benefit the reconstruction of complicated long-range maxillofacial bone defects. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84865794297	Blocking the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 with cariporide (HOE642) reduces the hypoxia-induced invasion of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma	The Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) plays a significant role in acidifying the tumour microenvironment, potentially contributing to the tumour's malignant potential. The mechanism by which NHE1 mediates cell invasion and migration, especially in human tongue squamous cell carcinoma (hTSCC), is unknown. In this study, the authors demonstrated that inhibition of NHE1 by cariporide (HOE642) suppressed the invasion and migration of Tca8113 cells under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia also promoted the production of MMP-9, and the suppressive role of cariporide was enacted through the downregulation of MMP-9. The data demonstrated that NHE1 plays a role in hTSCC invasion and that NHE1 might be a new target for hTSCC treatment. © 2012 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

0037389491	A new model of blast injury from a spherical explosive and its special wound in the maxillofacial region	Objective: The goal of this study was to establish an efficient explosive model with spherical explosives for the study of blast injury and its wound characteristics in the maxillofacial region. Methods: Different spherical explosives were used to produce blast waves and to establish the wound model. Fresh sheep heads as the targets were used for the study of wound characteristics. The wounding parameters and the injuries of targets after explosion were observed. Results: The overpressure values of blast waves decreased exponentially along with the increase of distances to explosives and so did the tissue damage. The blast injury is quite different from other injuries and is more serious. A kind of special "split fracture" of the mandibles was found. Conclusions: The new explosive wound model with spherical explosives can be used for the study of blast injury in the laboratory. The injury manner of blast wave and the local anatomy of tissues resulted in the special wound characteristics.

84870807655	Engineering Vascularized Bone Graft With Osteogenic and Angiogenic Lineage Differentiated Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells	Tissue-engineered bone provides a promising method for the rehabilitation of acquired bone defects and congenital deformities. However, generating a vascular supply to the engineered graft remains a major challenge. We report a novel strategy to engineer vascularized bone grafts with osteogenic and angiogenic lineage differentiated marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs were expanded to form an osteogenic cell sheet using a continuous culture method and a scraping technique under osteogenic culture conditions. Another portion of MSCs was directed to differentiate into highly proliferative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which were then seeded onto the cell sheets. Cell sheet-EPC complexes were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice. Cell sheets without EPCs were also implanted as a control. The mice were sacrificed, and the samples were harvested for evaluation consisting of micro-CT scanning, histological analysis and scanning electronic microscopy 4 and 8weeks after implantation. The results showed that cell sheets were composed of viable cells and extracellular matrix and showed apparent mineralization. The obtained EPCs could express the specific antigen marker of CD31 and form capillary-like structures in vitro. The osteogenic cell sheet-EPC complexes yielded well-vascularized bone grafts 4 and 8weeks after implantation. Both bone density and vascular density were significantly higher in the cell sheet-EPC complex group than in the control group. The results demonstrated that the introduction of EPCs could not only generate a vascular network but also increase bone formation for cell sheet-based bone engineering. These findings suggest that the strategy of engineering bone grafts with osteogenic and angiogenic lineage differentiated MSCs has great potential for clinical applications to repair large bone defects. © 2012, Copyright the Authors.

84875879658	TCF3, a novel positive regulator of osteogenesis, plays a crucial role in miR-17 modulating the diverse effect of canonical Wnt signaling in different microenvironments	Wnt signaling pathways are a highly conserved pathway, which plays an important role from the embryonic development to bone formation. The effect of Wnt pathway on osteogenesis relies on their cellular environment and the expression of target genes. However, the molecular mechanism of that remains unclear. On the basis of the preliminary results, we observed the contrary effect of canonical Wnt signaling on osteogenic differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs) in the different culture environment. Furthermore, we found that the expression level of miR-17 was also varied with the change in the culture environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-17 and canonical Wnt signaling may have potential interactions, particularly the inner regulation relationship in different microenvironments. In this paper, we observed that canonical Wnt signaling promoted osteogenesis of PDLSCs in the fully culture medium, while inhibited it in the osteogenic differentiation medium. Interestingly, alteration in the expression level of endogenous miR-17 could partially reverse the different effect of canonical Wnt signaling. Furthermore, the role of miR-17 was because of its target gene TCF3 (transcription factor 3), a key transcription factor of canonical Wnt pathway. Overexpression of TCF3 attenuated the effect of miR-17 on modulating canonical Wnt signaling. Finally, we elucidated that TCF3 enhanced osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. In brief, the different level of miR-17 was the main cause of the different effect of canonical Wnt signaling, and TCF3 was the crucial node of miR-17-canonial Wnt signaling regulation loop. This understanding of microRNAs regulating signaling pathways in different microenvironments may pave the way for fine-tuning the process of osteogenesis in bone-related disorders. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84878207211	Locally injection of cell sheet fragments enhances new bone formation in mandibular distraction osteogenesis: A rabbit model	Effective methods to shorten the treatment period of distraction osteogenesis (DO) are needed. To investigate whether injections of osteogenic bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) sheet fragments could be used to facilitate new bone formation during DO, 30 rabbits underwent bilateral mandibular osteotomy and their mandibles were lengthened at a rate of 0.75 mm/12 h for 6 days after a 5-day latency period. There were three treatment groups (n = 10 for each group): Serum-free medium, dissociated BMSCs, and BMSC sheet fragments. A local injection was conducted with a needle directly into the distracted areas immediately after distraction. Rabbits were sacrificed for examination at 3 and 6 weeks after injection. Gross examination, radiographic evaluation, and micro-CT scanning indicated a significant increase in bony union in the BMSC sheet fragment group, compared with the medium group and the dissociated cell group. The histomorphometric analysis showed more intensive bone formation in the sheet fragment group than the other two groups at each time point. Additionally, the peak load was significantly higher in the fragment group than those in the others. The results show that injection of BMSC sheet fragments promotes bone formation in DO and indicate a promising approach to shorten the treatment period of osteodistraction. © 2013 Orthopaedic Research Society.

84879837832	Three-dimensional facial anthropometry of unilateral cleft lip infants with a structured light scanning system	Background Cleft lip in the presence or absence of a cleft palate is a major public health problem. However, few studies have been published concerning the soft-tissue morphology of cleft lip infants. Currently, obtaining reliable three-dimensional (3D) surface models of infants remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate a new way of capturing 3D images of cleft lip infants using a structured light scanning system. In addition, the accuracy and precision of the acquired facial 3D data were validated and compared with direct measurements. Study design Ten unilateral cleft lip patients were enrolled in the study. Briefly, 3D facial images of the patients were acquired using a 3D scanner device before and after the surgery. Fourteen items were measured by direct anthropometry and 3D image software. The accuracy and precision of the 3D system were assessed by comparative analysis. Results The anthropometric data obtained using the 3D method were in agreement with the direct anthropometry measurements. All data calculated by the software were 'highly reliable' or 'reliable', as defined in the literature. The localisation of four landmarks was not consistent in repeated experiments of inter-observer reliability in preoperative images (P < 0.05), while the intra-observer reliability in both pre- and postoperative images was good (P > 0.05). Conclusions The structured light scanning system is proven to be a non-invasive, accurate and precise method in cleft lip anthropometry. © 2013 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

However, the exact molecular mechanism by which the mechanical stimulus is translated into biological signals is still poorly understood. In this study, we examined and compared the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) during mandibular distraction osteogenesis and fracture in rats, respectively. Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups and received unilateral distraction osteogenesis and rigid internal fixation, respectively, after the osteotomy on the right mandible. The harvested mandibles were examined radiographically, histologically, and immunohistochemically. We found that the expression of SDF-1 was mainly detected in the osteoblasts and blood vessels, and there were more intensive expression of SDF-1 in DO zones than in bone fracture zones. The quantitative analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that SDF-1 reached a greater peak and maintained a longer period of up-regulation in DO than in fracture healing (P < 0.05). These results suggest that the distraction procedure markedly promotes the high expression of SDF-1 which facilitates the induction of bone formation during DO. Copyright © 2013 by Mutaz B.

84883259484	Rigid internal fixation methods of unilateral condylar neck fracture combined with contralateral parasymphyseal fracture	One of the most important factors for ensuring the success of fracture treatment is determining the local mechanical environment of rigid internal fixation. This work aims to determine an effective treatment for unilateral condylar neck fracture combined with contralateral parasymphyseal fracture by selecting a rigid internal fixation method from a biomechanical perspective. First, the model for the unilateral condylar neck fracture combined with contralateral parasymphyseal fracture was established. Then, a 3D finite element method was used to analyze the nodal displacement isograms and the von Mises stress isograms of the mandible, as well as the maximum von Mises value in the fixation plate with single titanium or double titanium miniplate fixation of the condylar neck. When the condylar neck was fixed with a single titanium miniplate, the displacement value of the mandible decreased in the right fracture section, but increased in the middle and the left fracture sections. The stress trajectories were interrupted at the left external oblique line and the right sigmoid notch. The maximum von Mises value in the fixation plate was 574.179 MPa. When the condylar neck was fixed with double titanium miniplates, the stress trajectories were not interrupted. Compared with using single miniplate fixation, the nodal displacement of the right fracture section was greater, whereas those of the middle and the left fracture sections were lower when double miniplate fixation was employed. The maximum von Mises values in the posterior and the anterior border of the miniplate were 263.324 and 199.122 MPa, respectively. Thus, for unilateral condylar neck fracture combined with contralateral parasymphyseal fracture, the fixation effect is better when double titanium miniplates are used on the condylar neck compared with using a single titanium miniplate.

84883155366	Nuclear Multidrug-Resistance Related Protein 1 Contributes to Multidrug-Resistance of Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma Mainly via Regulating Multidrug-Resistance Protein 1: A Human Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma Cells Model and Spearman's Rank Correlation Analysis	Background:Multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein/ABCB1) are both membrane-bound drug transporters. In contrast to MDR1, MRP1 also transports glutathione (GSH) and drugs conjugated to GSH. Due to its extraordinary transport properties, MRP1/ABCC1 contributes to several physiological functions and pathophysiological incidents. We previously found that nuclear translocation of MRP1 contributes to multidrug-resistance (MDR) of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). The present study investigated how MRP1 contributes to MDR in the nuclei of MEC cells.Methods:Western blot and RT-PCR was carried out to investigate the change of multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1) in MC3/5FU cells after MRP1 was downregulated through RNA interference (RNAi). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of 127 cases of MEC tissues was scored with the expression index (EI). The EI of MDR1 and MRP1 (or nuclear MRP1) was analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation analysis. Using multiple tumor tissue assays, the location of MRP1 in other tissues was checked by HIC. Luciferase reporter assays of MDR1 promoter was carried out to check the connection between MRP1 and MDR1 promoter.Results:MRP1 downregulation led to a decreased MDR1 expression in MC3/5FU cells which was caused by decreased activity of MDR1 promoter. IHC study of 127 cases of MEC tissues demonstrated a strong positive correlation between nuclear MRP1 expression and MDR1 expression. Furthermore, IHC study of multiple tumor tissue array sections showed that although nuclear MRP1 widely existed in MEC tissues, it was not found in normal tissues or other tumor tissues.Conclusions:Our findings indicate that nuclear MRP1 contributes to MDR mainly through regulating MDR1 expression in MEC. And the unique location of MRP1 made it an available target in identifying MEC from other tumors. © 2013 Cai et al.

84883802138	Effect of mandibular advancement on the natural position of the head: A preliminary study of 3-dimensional cephalometric analysis	Our aim was to investigate the potential effect of advancement by bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) on the natural position of the head by using 3-dimensional cephalomentric analysis. Seven consecutive patients who had had only BSSO advancement, and had had preoperative and 6-week postoperative cone beam computed tomography (CT) scans, were recruited to this retrospective study. Two variables, SNB and SNC2, were used to indicate the craniomandibular alignment and craniocervical inclination, respectively, in the midsagittal plane. Using 3-dimensional cephalometric analysis software, the SNB and the SNC2 were recorded in volume and measured in the midsagittal plane at 3 independent time-points. The reliability was measured and a paired t test used to assess the significance of differences between the means of SNB and SNC2 before and after operation. The 3-dimensional cephalometric measurement showed good reliability. The SNB was increased as planned in all the mandibles that were advanced, the cervical vertebrae were brought forward after BSSO, and the SNC2 was significantly increased in 6 of the 7 patients. Three-dimensional cephalometric analysis may provide an alternative way of assessing cephalometrics. After BSSO advancement, the natural position of the head changed by increasing the craniocervical inclination in an anteroposterior direction. © 2012 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84889885891	Recruitment of exogenous mesenchymal stem cells in mandibular distraction osteogenesis by the stromal cell-derived factor-1/chemokine receptor-4 pathway in rats	Distraction osteogenesis is widely used in orthopaedic and craniofacial surgery. However, its exact mechanism is still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to find out whether there is systemic recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to the neocallus in the distraction gap by the stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) axis during osteogenesis. We examined the migration of MSC towards a gradient of SDF-1 in vitro. We also transplanted MSC labelled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) intravenously, with or without treatment with CXCR4-blocking antibody, into rats that had had unilateral mandibular distraction osteogenesis, and investigated the distribution of cells labelled with GFP in the soft callus after 24 h. We found that SDF-1 facilitated the migration potency of MSC both in vitro and in vivo, and this migration could be inhibited by AMD3100, an antagonist of CXCR4, and promoted by local infusion of exogenous SDF-1 into the distraction gap. This study provides a new insight into the molecular basis of how new bone is regenerated during distraction osteogenesis. © 2013 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84893662816	Coculture of peripheral blood CD34+ cell and mesenchymal stem cell sheets increase the formation of bone in calvarial critical-size defects in rabbits	The reconstruction of large bony defects remains a clinical challenge, and angiogenesis and neovascularisation are being given more attention in bone tissue engineering. In this study we cocultured peripheral blood CD34+ cells (PB-CD34+ cells), an endothelial progenitor cell/haematopoietic stem cell-enriched population, with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to investigate their potential for bony regeneration. Cocultured cells showed better osteogenic differentiation than MSC alone in vitro. The cocultured cells and MSC sheets were also composited with hydroxyapatite and implanted in calvarial critical-size defects in rabbits. The rabbits were killed before microcomputed tomographic (MicroCT) and histological analysis. The results showed that cocultured cell composites had promoted bony regeneration more efficiently by 8 weeks after implantation. Our results indicate that the coculture of PB-CD34+ cells and MSC increases bony regeneration in calvarial critical-size defects in rabbits, and provide a new promising therapeutic strategy to aid skeletal healing. © 2013 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84899854112	Overexpression of DDR2 contributes to cell invasion and migration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	Background: Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is a unique receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is activated by fibrillar collagens. Although DDR2 contributes to the metastasis of some tumors, its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression level, clinical and pathological significance, and biologic function of DDR2 in HNSCC. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining were employed to assess the expression levels of DDR2 in HNSCC specimens. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of DDR2 was used to evaluate its consequences on cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and the process of hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Then nude mouse xenograft and tail vein metastasis models were utilized to validate the in vitro results. Results: DDR2 was highly expressed in high grade HNSCC tissues and lowly expressed in low grade HNSCC tissues, but absent or rarely expressed in cancer-associated normal tissues. Both the frequency and expression intensity of DDR2 were significantly associated with tumor pathologic stage and lymph node metastasis. In vitro, DDR2 overexpression in HNSCC cells failed to alter cell proliferation but markedly accelerates cell invasion and migration as well as hypoxiainduced EMT. In vivo, elevated expression of DDR2 speeds up the metastasis of HNSCC cells to the lung. Conclusion: DDR2 plays an important role in HNSCC metastasis, and might be a promising target for future therapies in this type of cancer. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

84902547482	Fundamental study of application of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells to the periodontium to aid healing after autotransplantation of teeth	After autotransplantation of teeth the healing of periodontal tissue regulates the patient's prognosis. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSC) have shown excellent pluripotent and proliferation potential. In the present study we investigated the characteristics and developmental capability of osteogenic differentiation to find out whether human UCMSC promote periodontal healing. UCMSC were obtained by primary culture and identified using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blotting, assays of alkaline phosphatase activity, and alizarin red staining were used to assess the potential for hUCMSC to proliferate and differentiate in vitro. Both dentine and predifferentiated or undifferentiated cells were transplanted subcutaneously onto the backs of immunodeficient mice to mimic periodontal tissue healing in vivo. The result showed that hUCMSC were readily obtained, and expressed numerous mesenchymal stem cell markers. Expression of stemness markers decreased notably during osteogenic differentiation. Through investigation of different time points, we found that the osteogenic procedure could be activated and detected at day 7. In the in vivo experiments, the predifferentiated hUCMSC showed increased ability to form cementum-like deposits surrounded by fibroblast-like tissue on the surface of the dentine. In conclusion, the potential for proliferation and differentiation, and the ability to form cementum-like tissue, suggest that hUCMSC are promising candidates as a source of mesenchymal stem cell for sources of periodontal healing after autotransplantation of teeth. © 2014 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

84906839788	QKI impairs self-renewal and tumorigenicity of oral cancer cells via repression of SOX2	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may contribute to tumor initiation, distant metastasis and chemo-resistance. One of RNA-binding proteins, Quaking (QKI), was reported to be a tumor suppressor. Here we showed that reduced QKI levels were observed in many human oral cancer samples. Moreover further reduction of QKI expression in CSCs was detected compared with non-CSCs in oral cancer cell lines. Overexpressing QKI in oral cancer cells significantly reduced CSC sphere formation and stem cell-associated genes. In tumor implanting nude mice model, QKI significantly impeded tumor initiation rates, tumor sizes and lung metastasis rates. As a contrast, knocking down QKI enhanced the above effects. Among the putative CSC target genes, SOX2 expression was negatively affected by QKI, mechanism study revealed that QKI may directly regulate SOX2 expression via specific binding with its 3′UTR in a cis element-dependent way. Loss of SOX2 even completely reversed the sphere forming ability in QKI knockdown cell line. Taken together, these data demonstrated that SOX2 is an important CSC regulator in oral cancer. QKI is a novel CSC inhibitor and impaired multiple oral CSC properties via partial repression of SOX2. Therefore, reduced expression of QKI may provide a novel diagnostic marker for oral cancer. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.

11344262733	Experimental study of distraction of osteogenesis for repairing alveolar cleft	Aim: To observe the repair of alveolar cleft(AC) under distraction osteogenesis(DO) using tooth-attached distractor so as to search a credible new treatment for repair of alveolar cleft or bone defect. Methods: Ten gybrid adult dogs were used in the study. The animal models of artificial alveolar cleft were established: 2 were in control group and 8 in experimental group. Two weeks after alveolar bone osteoectomy, the tooth-bone complex transport disc(TD) were performed by vertical interdental and horizontal subapical osteotomy, at the same time the tooth-attached distrator was fixed. Seven days after operation, the gradual distraction was started at the rate of 0.4 mm twice a day till the TD reached the opposite edge of the AC. Two animals were put to death after fixed in situ 0, 14, 28, 63 days. Animals in control group were put to death 12 weeks after the establishment of alveolar cleft. The samples were observed with X-ray, gross and histology observation methods. Results: TD recombination to the opposite edge of the AC, simultaneously, the proportional expansion of overlay mucoperisteal flap was achieved. Radiographically and histologically, the cleft gaps were bridged and new alveolar bone was generated and remodeled. Conclusion: The tooth-attached distractor can get effective distraction and designed reasonably. The study results suggest that a new approach for the repair of alveolar cleft under DO, which provides theoretical and experimental bases for its clinical application.

11844276579	Three-dimensional sutural expansion osteogenesis to expand zygomatic bone: An experimental study	Sutural expansion osteogenesis was used to extend zygomatic bone three-dimensionally by the formation of new bone in eight goats. A 3 cm incision without osteomy was made in the infraorbital part of the zygomatic bone. The external expansion appliance was then placed on the zygomatic bone. The expansion appliance was activated 10 days after the operation at a rate of 0.9 mm/day for 10 days. The direction could be changed through turning the nuts and moving the brace boards. All the zygomatic bones were expanded anterosuperolaterally and inferolaterally by a mean of 9 mm (range 7.8-11.5 mm). The regenerating bone tissues in the distracted sutures were recorded radiographically, clinically, and histologically. The experiment succeeded in expanding the zygoma quickly. The three-dimensional external expansion appliance was simple to operate. The result of sutural expansion osteogenesis is stable and credible, and the method is feasible. © 2004 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84924527299	Prototyped grafting plate for reconstruction of mandibular defects	To esthetically and functionally restore a 40-mm canine mandibular discontinuity defect using a custom-made titanium bone-grafting plate in combination with autologous iliac bone grafts. Individualized titanium bone-grafting plates were manufactured using a series of techniques, including reverse engineering, computer aided design, rapid prototyping and titanium casting. A 40-mm discontinuous defect in the right mandibular body was created in 9 hybrid dogs. The defect was restored immediately using the customized plate in combination with autologous cancellous iliac blocks. Sequential radionuclide bone imaging was performed to evaluate the bone metabolism and reconstitution of the grafts. The specimens were evaluated by biomechanical testing, 3-dimensional microcomputed tomographic scanning, and histological examination. The results revealed that the symmetry of the mandibles was reconstructed using the customized grafting plate, and the bony continuity of the mandibles was restored. By 12 weeks after the operation, the cancellous iliac grafts became a hard bone block, which was of comparable strength to native mandibles. A fibrous tissue intermediate was found between the remodelled bone graft and the titanium plate. The results indicate that the prototyped grafting plate can be used to restore mandibular discontinuous defects, and satisfactory aesthetical and functional reconstruction can be achieved.
