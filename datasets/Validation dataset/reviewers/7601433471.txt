34547618827	Fast detection of overlapped areas in smart camera network	Finding overlapped areas among images is a fundamental problem while building a multi-camera network. In a cooperative vision task, cameras must determine their relative positions with respect to each other. In this paper, a fast view matching based method is proposed to detect overlapped areas for un-calibrated camera network. We accomplish view matching by detecting interesting points matched with their local image descriptor. The detection of interesting points is based on the SURF algorithm, which is suitable for real time processing. The local image descriptor matching is built on the local binary pattern (LBP) histogram, which is robust for illuminating changes and image rotations.

57949105201	Real-time moving target tracking based on dynamically switching models	Aiming at moving target tracking in video surveillance systems, a real-time tracking method based on dynamically switching models is proposed. After moving target segmentation, the tracking system effectively estimates the occlusion state of moving objects. A region-based tracking model is deployed for non-occluded moving objects, and a narrow-scale image matching model based on SIFT (scale invariant feature transform) features is deployed for occluded moving objects. The region-based tracking model uses simple target region features and motion prediction attributes to implement rapid tracking. Because the tracked targets only have very small scale changes and limited range on target region position prediction between neighboring image frames, the image matching model based on SIFT features can also implement rapid SIFT features matching and tracking. Experimental results show that the method is robust and can effectively achieve real-time multi-target tracking in complex occlusion scenes.

0034592174	Rotor faults diagnosis instrument	With the view of the mechanical fault characteristics of the rotor (such as correlation and fuzziness), this paper puts forward a novel distributed rotor faults diagnosis instrument based on modular fuzzy neural networks. The distributed instrument system samples the multichannel vibration signals with synchronization and high speed, and then extracts the fault features by signal processing. A two-level integration strategy is employed in the modular fuzzy neural networks based diagnosis model. The first level is composed of fuzzy BP neural networks that determine which fuzzy neural networks block at the second level is activated according to the output member function values. The second level is composed of six fuzzy BP neural networks blocks, and each of them is further applied to diagnose some similar faults. The inference principle of the model is that the output node with larger member function value is first activated. With the input fault feature data, the model yields diagnosis conclusion that gives the possible faults with their corresponding member function value and inference route.

77954751548	Fast disparity estimation using spatio-temporal correlation of disparity field for multiview video coding	Disparity estimation is adopted by multiview video coding (MVC) to reduce the inter-view redundancy. However, it consumes enormous computational load. In this paper, a fast disparity estimation is proposed by using the spatio-temporal correlation and the temporal variation of disparity field. For each macroblock, a temporal prediction of the disparity vector is calculated first by utilizing the smoothed disparity field of the previous coded frame. Then, the search center is selected among the candidates obtained from spatio-temporal neighboring disparity vectors, and deemed to be a preliminary disparity vector. Finally, the search range is predicted adaptively by using the distance between the search center and the temporal prediction of the disparity vector, and then the search is implemented in a limited range. The distance represents the temporal variation of the disparity vector. As compared to the full search algorithm in MVC reference software, experimental results show that an average 96% reduction of the computational complexity is achieved, while the rate-distortion performance remains the same. As compared to the fast search algorithm in MVC reference software, experimental results show that an average 43% reduction of the computational complexity is achieved, and the rate-distortion performance of the proposed algorithm has been improved. © 2006 IEEE.

84861898533	Gradient based fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in HEVC	High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is an ongoing video compression standard and a successor to H.264/AVC. It aims to provide significantly improved compression performance as compared to all existing video coding standards. In the intra prediction of HEVC, this is being achieved by providing up to 35 intra modes with larger coding unit. The optimal mode is selected by a rough mode decision (RMD) process from all of the available modes first, and then through the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) process for the final decision. Because the fact that every coding unit with different sizes is traversed in both procedures makes it very time-consuming, a gradient based fast mode decision algorithm is proposed in this paper to reduce the computational complexity of HEVC. Prior to intra prediction, gradient directions are calculated and a gradient-mode histogram is generated for each coding unit. Based on the distribution of the histogram, only a small part of the candidate modes are chosen for the RMD and the RDO processes. As compared to the default encoding scheme in HEVC test model HM 4.0, experimental results show that the fast intra mode decision scheme provides almost 20% time savings in all intra low complexity cases on average with negligible loss of coding efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.

The amount and relative encoding parameters of redundant pictures for each frame are adaptively decided for multiple redundant pictures, and this is different from the relevant existing description generation methods, which mainly focus on determining the amount of inserted redundancy with a fixed single redundant picture. The relationship of encoding parameters between each redundant picture of the same frame is derived according to the classification and formulation of relative distortion and rate. To accelerate the encoding process, the statistical properties between mismatch distortion, bit rate and encoding parameter are explored for the fast decision of redundant picture number. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the overall end-to-end ratedistortion performance compared with the state-of-the-art multiple description coding method utilising redundant coding.

48749097280	Lightweight content-adaptive coding in joint analyzing-encoding framework	A novel joint analyzing-encoding framework is proposed in this paper. With this framework, the video analysis and the video coding can be integrated together, which can decrease the computational complexity of the video process system due to the obtained shared information. A lightweight content-adaptive video coding scheme can be achieved by using the presented framework for H.264 standard. The side encoding information, including motion vectors (MVs) and sum of absolute differences (SADs), can be used to reduce the computation cost of the moving region analysis. First, the rectangular shape and the displacement information of the moving region in the current encoded frame are obtained by employing a robust binary detection method, which is based on the adaptive threshold and the fast components labeling algorithm. Then, the rectangular shape information of the next frame is achieved by using a simple but effective prediction method, which considers the principle of the temporal motion constraint. Finally, a motion importance mask map (MIMP) is obtained according to the predicted rectangular shape information. Meanwhile, a category of frequency coefficient suppression (FCS) technique in the transform domain is presented to avoid the use of the complex MB-layer rate control method. With MIMP and FCS, a lightweight content-adaptive video coding scheme is realized based on a simple frame-layer rate control method. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can detect and predict the moving regions fast and improve the objective/subjective visual quality significantly for the moving regions. © 2008 IEEE.

But these models have high computational load and large memory requirement because a large set of background samples is usually needed to model the background. In this paper, a background model based on region segmentation is proposed. An Adaptive single Gaussian background model is used in the Stable Region with gradual changes and nonparametric model is used in the Variable Region with jumping changes. A Generalized Agglomerative Scheme is used to merge the pixels in the Variable Region and fill the small interspaces. A Two-Threshold Sequential Algorithmic Scheme is used to group the background samples of the Variable Region into distinct Gaussian distributions. The kernel density computation complexity is largely reduced by arranging the computation order of these groups according to their proximity in mean value to the current pixel sample being estimated.

The algorithm also dynamically balances the tracking load of each camera and allocates the high-load targets with low priority in the camera to other cameras. In order to effectively establish the correspondence between the targets of overlapping cameras, the target matching is implemented by homography transformation of target centroid coordinates in the scenes where the cameras are far away from the ground plane and targets, and by SIFT features matching of targets in other scenes. The coefficients of homography transformation are computed by the corresponding keypoints created by SIFT features matching of surveillance background images of the cameras.

77954464997	Is playing-as-downloading feasible in an eMule P2P file sharing system?	Peer-to-peer (P2P) swarm technologies have been shown to be very efficient for large scale content distribution systems, such as the well-known BitTorrent and eMule applications. However, these systems have been designed for generic file sharing with little consideration of media streaming support, and the user cannot start a movie playback before it is completely downloaded. The playing-as-downloading capability would be particularly useful for a downloading peer to evaluate if a movie is valuable to be downloaded, and it could also help the P2P content distribution system to locate and eliminate the polluted contents. In this paper we address this issue by introducing a new algorithm, wish driven chunk distribution (WDCD), which enables the P2P file sharing system to support the video-on-demand (VOD) function while keeping the P2P native downloading speed. A new parameter named next-play-frequency is added to the content chunk to strike a replication balance between downloading and streaming requests. We modify the eMule as the test bed by adding the WDCD algorithm and then verify the prototype implementation by experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can keep the high downloading throughput performance of the eMule system with a good playing-as-downloading function. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79959553287	SmartPeerCast: A Smart QoS driven P2P live streaming framework	The P2P swarm technologies have been shown to be very efficient for medium scale content distribution systems in the last few years, such as the file sharing and video-on-demand (VOD) applications. However it is still an open topic about how to deploy the P2P paradigm for the real time video broadcasting (RTVB) applications. The P2P RTVB application is different from the cache based P2P system because it has more stringent restrictions for startup time and packet loss ratio. In this paper, an adaptive media broadcasting P2P framework named SmartPeerCast which employs the media transrating service to control the quality of service (QoS), is proposed. SmartPeerCast achieves a network awareness, codec awareness, and high performance RTVB service with four key designs: (1) It groups the newly joined peers into different quality clusters by their uploading capability. This clustering mechanism avoids the bandwidth bottleneck between the heterogeneous peers of the overall P2P overlay by only forwarding the same quality stream over the peers in the same cluster. (2) The streaming quality is adjusted adaptively between the sending and the receiving peers by a Smart QoS algorithm to compensate for the network jitters to reduce the receiving peer's playback jitter. (3) The receiving peer monitors the data forwarding QoS of the sending peer to select the best suitable parent node dynamically. The SmartPeerCast uses this Smart QoS framework to implement an incentive mechanism to award the peers with high uploading contributions by migrating them to a higher quality cluster. (4) A transrating engine is used at the leaf nodes of the high quality cluster to forward the stream with suitable bits rate to the nodes of the low quality cluster; this transrating service not only can fully utilize the uploading bandwidth of the peers in the higher quality cluster but also avoids the bandwidth bottleneck of stream forwarding between the heterogeneous peers. Our experiment results and the real deployment show that SmartPeerCast can eliminate the bandwidth bottleneck and content bottleneck between the heterogeneous peers with a smaller startup time and packet loss and it is a high performance and medium scale P2P RTVB framework. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In this paper, an adaptive flexible macroblock ordering (FMO) scheme based on encoding domain for error-resilient encoding is proposed to cope with this challenge. A motion area extraction method is first utilized, and the error sensitivity of motion area is then computed according to both transmission condition and input picture features.

80053944277	Rate distortion optimization based on partial decoding for scalable video coding	In scalable video coding, the original bit-stream can be cropped and generate multiple sub-bit-streams. In order to optimize coding efficiency of both the original bit-stream and the sub-bit-streams, partial decoding based on a Rate Distortion Optimization(RDO) algorithm is proposed. In the enhancement layer's RDO process, the influence of sub-bit-streams on coding efficiency is predicted by selectively truncating Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT) coefficients. The propagation distortion map is then used to estimate the drift error. In the base layer's RDO process, the multi-layer coding method is employed to cope with the constraint between the layers' mode choice. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the algorithm, both the partially decoded reconstruction process and the base layer's mode decision are optimized. Finally, the configuration of parameters is discussed and chosen adaptively based on the error propagation sensitivity on a macroblock basis. From experimental results, the proposed algorithm improves the sub-bit-streams' Peak Signal to Noise Ratio(PSNR) by 0.03-0.53 dB. For the scalable video system, the proposal can meet the needs of high coding efficiency and flexible sub-bit-rate extraction.

When an active component fails, a standby component will be activated to guarantee the system in operation continuously. The standby component and the switching device have been usually assumed to be continuously functional during the setup of the reliability model.

The estimated error propagation distortion and bit consumption of refresh MB are used for the mode and reference frame decision of refresh MB. Secondly, by analyzing the statistical property in the successive frames, the error propagation distortion and bit consumption are formulated as a function of temporal distance. Encoding parameters of the current frame is determined by the estimated error propagation distortion and bit consumption. Thirdly, by comparing the rate-distortion cost of different combinations, proper selection of error resilience method is performed before the encoding process of the current frame. Finally, the MB mode and bit distribution of the primary picture are analyzed for the derivation of the texture information. The motion information is subsequently incorporated for the calculation of video content complexity to implement the content based redundant coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance gains over the LA-RDO and HRP method when video is transmitted over error-prone channel.
