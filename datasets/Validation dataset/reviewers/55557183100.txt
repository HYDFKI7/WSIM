33644991532	Research on the state property of manufacturing resource in dynamic network environment	Well-defined resource model is significant for resource management in internet age; so many resource models have been developed. The key issue is that the resource dynamic property is lack of an in-depth study, although the resource property is the universal element in these models. This research focuses on the dynamic property of resource. A new conception of state property was proposed. State property is distinguished from general resource properties in environmental and temporal correlation. Resource state property set was defined strictly. State property set is a perfect and independent set separated from dynamic property set. Completeness and time series are the primary features. Combined with a manufacturing resource model, the state property set was created to demonstrate the methods to get the state property set.

34250000841	Research and implementation of intelligent search engine based on ontology in parts-library	Research about development of the intelligent search engine based on ontology in parts-library were proposed, and a system architecture of the search engine was designed. Ontology is one of the most useful tools to remove information-sharing obstacles caused by heterogeneous descriptions for parts information. A four-layered descriptive ontology model was set up to deal with general-parts information and the following layers were described in detail: domain layer, event layer, category layer and concept layer. A six-factor intelligent search model for erecting user interfaces and the search logical flow were established. Mapping between the four-layered descriptive ontology model and the six-factor intelligent search model was discussed. A system based on the above theory was developed. Application of the system in an enterprise showed that the four-layered descriptive ontology model is able to describe general-parts information rationally and roundly, and that the six-factor intelligent search model is comparatively similar to nature languages, so the intelligent search engine based on ontology in parts-library according to these methods can improve the efficiency of Web parts-library.

To eliminate the impact of GMM smart component hysteresis and nonlinearity, a real-time hysteretic compensation control strategy combining a CMAC neural network feedforward controller and a sliding mode controller was proposed to implement the precision position tracking control of the smart component.

Based on the explanation that SDC can be viewed as community, it develops SDC (monetary value) structure by analogy with community (trophic) structure. As energy flow in ecology follows the first and second laws of thermodynamics, monetary value flow in business follows two laws that are similar to the laws of thermodynamics. Based on these laws, as well as throughput accounting and traditional cost accounting, it puts forward a general monetary value flow model in SDC (i.e. in demand chain and in supply chain respectively). Based on the value flow model in SDC, it conceives an SDC evolution model with a case study on the maturity of Toyota Motor Corporation. Based on these two models, it develops an SPMS for firms across SDC with procedural and structural frameworks. The discussion about monetary value flows in business from nature to the final consumers or converse gives a chance to coordinate business with nature. The SPMS that rationally integrates effective evaluation of tiers in SDC and practical product development plans in firm will help firms create a sustainable commerce (e.g. product-service system). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

They need to communicate and work concurrently on large amount of complex product data with their factories, sub-contractors as well as suppliers across the border.

The transformer failure cost calculation method based on the product structure tree was analyzed in the case of deficient fault record shortage. The definition of fault product base set (FPBS) was presented. The self-accurate failure cost calculation process model was established, which would be much more precise along with the increasing records. A lifelong cost calculation software for transformer was developed, which supports evaluation of LCC in bidding by using the proposed algorithm and helps enterprises accumulate product data. Then the situation of life cycle data shortage was gradually improved. A practical case study was provided for testing the proposed algorithm. Results show that the LCC model and system is feasible and effective in solving the problem of transformers total cost in whole life evaluation.

84899682977	Research on TRIZ-based product eco-design - integrating rule-based reasoning and case-based reasoning	To improve the efficiency of product eco-design and innovation, a theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) -based product eco-design approach integrating rule-based reasoning (RBR) and case-based reasoning (CBR) was put forward with respect to the characteristics of product eco-design. Product cases and design knowledge were represented through ontologies. An original design solution was selected from extant cases based on RBR and CBR and it was modified according to the results of reasoning and the design goal for new product, forming a preliminary design solution. Then improvable factors on eco-efficiency were selected, and a paradox matrix was constructed using TRIZ engineering parameters-eco-efficiency parameters correlating table. As a result, the improvements were solved through the paradox matrix and the technique system evolution theory. Furthermore, the case retrieval algorithm was studied and a TRIZ-based product eco-design system integrating RBR and CBR was established. Finally, a design case of three-phase squirrel cage induction motor was introduced to validate the effectiveness of this approach. The design cycle was shortened and meanwhile the ecology was improved.

84904762193	Packaging conceptual design of mechanical and electrical products based on low-carbon and cost constraint	The output value of mechanical and electrical products (MEP) packaging accounted for more 1/3 of the total domestic packaging. Excessive and unreasonable packaging has generated serious environmental and economic problems. Considering the packaging of low-carbon and cost issues in front of the life-cycle of MEP packaging, the model of concept design for MEP packaging based on low-carbon and cost constraint is proposed. The low-carbon design boundary and parameters about MEP packaging in the packaging concept design stage are discussed. The rules and methods for low-carbon and cost of MEP packaging concept design are provided. And the low-carbon efficiency is identified as the evaluation criteria of packaging design of MEP. The case study of gasoline shows its detailed packaging conceptual design method and model based low-carbon and cost constraint. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84907579618	Idle time neighborhood search genetic algorithm for job shop scheduling	Aiming at the job shop scheduling optimization problem with objective of minimizing maximum completion time, a neighborhood search genetic algorithm based on idle time was proposed. Through analyzing the different decoding methods, an idle-time-based neighborhood structure and its search method were designed. The idle time between two adjacent operations on the same machine was analyzed, and the method of fully finding critical operation's machine idle time was provided. To find the machine idle time for back and forth of critical operation, the neighborhood search was realized by shifting critical operation to idle time position on condition of guaranteeing feasible solution. The operation shifting conditions to ensure the feasible solution were given with any two operation positions on the same machine. The idle-time-based neighborhood search was implanted in the genetic algorithm, and its effectiveness was verified by using typical examples.
