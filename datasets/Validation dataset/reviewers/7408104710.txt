22844444453	CAPD-related peritonitis due to Salmonella enteritidis in a patient with SLE	Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are prone to various infections, often associated with high mortality. Salmonella species are a rare cause of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis, but patients with lupus are susceptible to infection caused by Salmonella species. A 47-year-old woman who had systemic lupus erythematosus with end-stage renal disease and was undergoing CAPD presented with fever, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and turbid dialysate effluent. The effluent culture yielded Salmonella enteritidis. Although she was administered antibiotics to which the organism was susceptible in vitro, peritonitis was not cured. Her clinical condition stabilized after removal of the Tenckhoff catheter and prolonged antibiotic use. In Salmonella-related CAPD peritonitis, early catheter removal may be necessary to achieve complete treatment. © 2005 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

2542437013	Adiponectin in peritoneal dialysis patients: A comparison with hemodialysis patients and subjects with normal renal function	Background: Adiponectin, a cytokine with anti-inflammatory properties that is secreted from adipose tissue, is associated with insulin resistance. Adiponectin has been shown to be a predictor of cardiovascular events in both the general population and patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD); however, its role in peritoneal dialysis (PD) analogues remains unclear. Methods: Serum adiponectin levels, measured by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in subjects with normal renal function and patients undergoing HD or PD (28 subjects in each group), were analyzed to establish the relationship between adiponectin and lipid levels, as well as insulin resistance. In the second study, 104 PD patients were recruited to analyze the relationships between serum adiponectin level and residual renal and peritoneal function and C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Independent factors for serum adiponectin level were determined from multiple linear regression. Results: No significant difference was shown comparing serum adiponectin levels of PD and HD patients; however, both were significantly greater than those of control subjects (P < 0.01). Negative associations were shown between adiponectin and triglyceride (TG; P < 0.01) and insulin levels (P < 0.05) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (P < 0.01) for the former 2 groups; however, a positive association was shown for high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level (P < 0.05). Neither HD nor PD removed adiponectin significantly, with levels for the PD group negatively associated with residual renal function (P < 0.01) and CRP level (P < 0.001). PD patients administered glucose-lowering agents had lower adiponectin levels; however, lipid-lowering agents and renin-angiotensin blockades did not appear to affect them. Independent determinants for serum adiponectin level in PD patients were TG, HDL, and CRP levels and body mass index, after adjustment for age, sex, PD therapy duration, and diabetes. Adiponectin levels were not associated with left ventricular mass or ejection fraction. As for HD patients, PD patients had high adiponectin levels; adiponectin was not removed effectively using either of the studied dialysis modalities. In addition to a significant relationship with the components of insulin resistance, adiponectin level was associated with CRP level in these patients. Conclusion: These results indicate that adiponectin level in PD patients may be a good indicator of cardiovascular disease risk. © 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

25444484710	Peritoneal fibrosing syndrome: Pathogenetic mechanism and current therapeutic strategies	Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been established as a main renal replacement therapy for approximately 20 years. However, long-term peritoneal exposure to high glucose and other unphysiologic contents in the PD solution may potentiate the development of peritoneal fibrosing syndrome (PFS) in PD patients. PFS is composed of a wide spectrum of peritoneal alterations, which has been observed in PD patients. Molecular studies have shown that the fibrogenic effect of peritoneal mesothelial cells and the accompanying accumulation of extracellular matrix in the peritoneum are key events leading to PFS. In this review, we highlight the impact of PFS and its pathogenetic factors, including bioincompatible PD solution, multidisciplinary inflammatory mediators, and stimulatory cytokines in the peritoneal cavity. Current therapeutic strategies based on both clinical and basic evidence for the prevention or treatment of PFS are also reviewed. © 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

33644518405	Acute renal failure caused by mushroom poisoning	Despite the abundance of wild mushrooms growing in a variety of habitats in Taiwan, mushroom poisoning is rarely reported. Here, we report two cases of mushroom poisoning, possibly due to Amanita smithiana or a related species. A 54-year-old man and his 52-year-old wife presented with acute anuric renal failure 1 day after ingesting some white mushrooms they had collected when mountain climbing; they made a full recovery following hemodialysis and supportive treatment. Although rare, mushroom poisoning should be considered in the differential diagnoses of acute renal failure. ©2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33746113751	Clinical characteristics of patients with segmental renal infarction	Background: Renal infarction is usually an underestimated disease due to its rare and non-specific presentations; the renal survival of these patients is not well studied. The aim of the present analysis is to study the clinical features and outcome in patients who had documented renal infarction. Methods: Twenty-two patients (12 men and 10 women, mean age of 57.7 ± 3.44 years (28.4-83.3 years)) with image-confirmed segmental renal infarction in the past 15 years were enrolled. All patients were followed up at outpatient department with a median of 4 years (1-14 years). Initial and follow-up clinical characteristics and laboratory results were recorded. Results: The most common underlying disease was cardiovascular disease. Renal infarction often presented with non-specific symptoms, including flank pain (55%), vague abdominal pain (50%), nausea/vomiting (46%) and fever (27%).The levels of leucocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were all elevated at admission. The early diagnosis group (12/22) had more obvious flank pain, nausea/vomiting (P < 0.001) and higher alanine transaminase (P = 0.02). It also predisposed to undergo antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (all P < 0.04). During follow up, there was no recurrence in the whole study group, and a trend of better recovery of renal function was noted in the early diagnosis group. Conclusion: The serum creatinine level correlates with longer hospitalization length (P < 0.05). As regards long-term prognosis, no definite factor or treatment was found to have significant effect in segmental renal infarction patients. However, early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment seems to have a positive effect on future renal outcome. © 2006 The Authors.

33746296478	Levamisole-induced multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy: Clinical characteristics, outcome, and impact of treatment in 31 patients	Levamisole (LEV) has been used as an immunomodulating medication in patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers and as an adjuvant for chemotherapy. LEV, with or without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), induces multifocal inflammatory leukoencephalopathy (MIL). We identified 31 patients with LEV-induced MIL: 7 from our institution and 24 from a MEDLINE search. Twenty-one patients (67.7%) had been treated with a combination of LEV and 5-FU, while 10 patients had been treated with LEV alone. The onset of MIL was delayed in patients who took LEV and 5-FU in combination compared with the patients treated with LEV alone (11.7 ± 3.7 vs. 4 ± 2.5 wk, p < 0.001). Colon cancer (67.7%) was the most common indication for LEV administration. Gait ataxia occurred in 20 (64.5%) patients, and dysphagia was noted in 16 (51.6%) patients. Imaging studies revealed periventricular enhancement in 17 (54.8%) patients and supratentorial lesions in 16 (51.6%) patients. Cerebrospinal fluid studies showed lymphocytic pleocytosis in 10 of 21 (47.6%) patients. Early diagnosis of MIL and discontinuation of LEV is essential, yielding good recovery in most cases. Treatment with corticosteroids and/or intravenous immunoglobulin may be needed for this serious inflammatory encephalopathy. Twenty-nine patients exhibited improved clinical status and imaging findings after initial steroid or immunoglobulin treatment. Plasmapheresis may be an alternative regimen for patients with steroid resistance. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

33747200416	Spontaneous bilateral bacterial empyema in a patient with nephrotic syndrome	Spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM), a rare infectious complication among liver cirrhosis patients, is characterized by infection in the presence of pleural effusion without evidence of pre-existing pneumonia. The prevalence of SBEM in cirrhotic patients with hydrothorax is about 13%. However, it has previously not been reported in medical literature in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The most common microorganism identified is Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. We present a patient with a history of nephrotic syndrome caused by membranous nephropathy, who received steroids and cyclophosphamide. He developed bilateral SBEM due to Aeromonas hydrophila and E. coli, which were isolated from the left- and right-side pleural fluid, respectively. The detailed clinical course, treatment, and outcome are described. © 2005 The British Infection Society.

33748502765	Human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy	Human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is characterized by high-grade proteinuria and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Despite the large numbers of HIV-infected cases in Asian countries, data on HIVAN in this area are limited. We report a 54-year-old Taiwanese man with HIVAN who presented with cytomegalovirus retinitis, renal insufficiency (serum creatinine, 3.8 mg/dL) and nephrotic range proteinuria with a daily protein loss of 10.8g. Despite highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for 31 months, renal failure developed requiring maintenance hemodialysis. Renal biopsy showed collapsing focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, podocyte proliferation and tubulointerstitial nephritis with mononuclear cell infiltration. These features were compatible with HIVAN. Although hemodialysis was instituted, he died 2 months later due to nosocomial pneumonia complicated with multiple organ failure. In summary, this case of HIVAN in a Taiwanese patient shows that the condition may progress to ESRD despite successful viral suppression with HAART. © 2006 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

33846944316	Factors associated with metabolic acidosis in patients receiving parenteral nutrition	Aims: Metabolic acidosis is a common problem after infusion with chloride-based parenteral nutrition. However, it is unknown whether the occurrence of metabolic acidosis is related to this regimen of therapy or to patient-specific risk factors. Methods: Patients receiving parenteral nutrition from July to December 2003 at this hospital were included for a retrospective study. Patients were excluded who had illnesses that were potentially related to acid-base disorders. The remaining patients were divided on the basis of parental nutrition they had received: a chloride-base regimen group, and an acetate-based therapy group. Biochemical character and blood gas data were analysed. Continuous variables were analysed by t-test. Categorical variables were assessed by chi-squared test. Independent determinants for bicarbonate decline were analysed using forward stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Results: There were 29 patients (17 women, 12 men) who received chloride-based regimen and 26 patients (16 women, 10 men) took acetate-based therapy. The acetate group had significantly higher baseline serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen than chloride group. The blood pH, CO

36749097993	Higher plasma interleukin-18 levels associated with poor quality of sleep in peritoneal dialysis patients	Background. Sleep disorders are prevalent in patients with end-stage renal disease. Increasing evidence suggests that cytokines are involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between quality of sleep and plasma interleukin-18 levels in peritoneal dialysis patients. Methods. Plasma interleukin-18 levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methodology in 57 peritoneal dialysis patients. Quality of sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Demographic and routine laboratory data were recorded. Results. In our cohort, the poor sleepers had higher plasma interleukin-18 levels (559.16 ± 261.22 pg/ml vs 397.49 ± 191.81 pg/ml, P = 0.01). The plasma interleukin-18 level was positively correlated with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (r = 0.286, P = 0.031), that is, there was a positive association between higher plasma interleukin-18 levels and poorer quality of sleep. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that interleukin-18 may be involved in sleep disorders in end-stage renal disease patients. Higher plasma interleukin-18 levels are associated with poorer quality of sleep in peritoneal dialysis patients. Whether a cause-and-effect relationship exists between interleukin-18 and quality of sleep deserves further study. © The Author [2007]. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA.

0033377931	Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Serratia marcescens in two patients receiving corticosteroid therapy	Necrotizing fasciitis (NF), a devastating soft tissue infection, is rarely attributed to Serratia marcescens. We here report two patients with S. marcescens NF, both of whom had underlying renal disease and had been receiving corticosteroid therapy. The first patient, a 40-year-old man with systemic lupus erythematosus and uremia on prednisolone therapy, developed fulminant cellulitis and septic shock 1 month after a skin biopsy for cutaneous vasculitis of the left foot. The cellulitis evolved to NF, and blood and necrotic tissue cultures both grew S. marcescens. The patient completely recovered after debridement and ceftazidime therapy. The second patient, a 73-year-old man receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, developed right leg cellulitis that evolved to NF. Blood and necrotic tissue cultures both grew S. marcescens. After aggressive debridement and ciprofloxacin therapy, the NF improved. However, the patient died of aspiration pneumonia and massive gastrointestinal bleeding 1 month later. These findings illustrate that S. marcescens should be considered as a potential pathogen causing NF in susceptible hosts.

0032809520	Clinical findings and outcomes of intra-hemodialysis cardiopulmonary resuscitation	Renal failure with severe uremia is still an important cause of mortality, despite effective renal replacement therapy. Cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) is the most severe complication during hemodialysis (HD). To acquire more information about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during HD, we retrospectively enrolled 24 patients (11 males and 13 females) who had CPR during HD in a medical center during a 3-year period. Their mean age was 66.8 ± 16.8 years. The CPR rate of the patients from our outpatient department (0.02%) was significantly lower than that from general wards (0.11%), the intensive care unit (ICU, 0.16%), or the emergency room (ER, 0.38%). Eighteen patients (75%) were initially resuscitated successfully. Only 11 patients (45.8%) survived more than 24 h after CPR, and 2 patients (8.3%) survived more than 1 month, but none survived until discharge. The rates of surviving 24 h and surviving to discharge during HD were lower than those in the general wards, the ICU or the ER. Sepsis (33.3%) and cardiogenic shock (25%) were the two leading causes of death. For analyzing factors affecting the outcome of CPR, we divided the patients into 2 groups by survival time (≤ 24 vs, > 24 h). Patients with heart disease or with prolonged CPR durations (> 30 min) had shorter survival. No significant survival difference between the 2 groups was found due to factors of age, sex, diabetic nephropathy, pre-arrest morbidity scores, pre-arrest laboratory data, renal failure pattern, HD duration, the preceding HD time and ultrafiltrated volume.

0033744948	Incidence of exit-site infection with various exchange systems in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis	Background and purpose: The disconnect twin-bag (TB) system was first introduced in Taiwan for use as an exchange system in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in 1995. Following its introduction, the incidence of CAPD-associated peritonitis declined, but the incidence of exit-site infection (ESI) increased. To determine the cause of the increase in ESI incidence after the introduction of the TB system, this study compared the incidence of ESI among patients using the O set, ultraviolet antiseptic (UV) device, and the TB system. Methods: A total of 170 patients who had received CAPD for more than 3 months were enrolled in this study. Poisson test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to compare the ESI incidence and ESI-free catheter survival among patients using the O set, UV device, or TB system. Cox stepwise forward proportional hazard analysis was used to assess the impact of sex, education, cause of uremia, age, and type of exchange system on ESI. Results: The incidences of ESI differed significantly among patients using the three exchange systems, with 20.9, 13.8, and 4.0 episodes per 100 patient-years for patients using the TB system, O set, and UV device, respectively. New patients using the TB system also had a shorter mean interval of ESI-free catheter survival than those using the UV device (26.9 vs 58.8 months, p = 0.002). In the Cox stepwise forward proportional hazard analysis, non-lupus patients had a lower risk of developing ESI than lupus patients (relative risk [RR] 0.40, p = 0.03). The RR of ESI in patients using the UV device was also lower than in those using the TB system (RR 0.15, p < 0.01). Conclusion: In this study, use of the TB system was associated with a higher incidence of ESI. The increased ESI incidence may be related to the heavier mini-transfer set of the TB system. Therefore, special attention should be given to fastening the mini-transfer set tightly during the exchanging procedure to prevent traction on the exit-site, which is associated with an increased incidence of subsequent ESI.

0033944032	Clinical features of and risk factors for fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients	Background and purpose: Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a serious complication for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and can result in technical failure and mortality. Catheter removal remains the mainstay of treatment. This study sought to identify the risk factors for FP in order to facilitate the prevention of this catastrophic complication. Methods: A total of 246 patients who received long-term PD from 1985 to 1998 were included in this retrospective study. Twenty episodes of FP occurred in 19 patients. The clinical characteristics, pathogens, treatment modalities, and outcomes of the FP episodes were retrospectively reviewed. The FP incidence in various demographic and clinical groups, classified according to sex, age, education, and underlying cause of uremia, were compared with the Poisson test. Results: Thirteen episodes of FP were caused by yeast, and the remaining episodes were caused by Aspergillus spp. Age, sex, and education did not affect the FP incidence. Lupus patients (969 patient-months) had a higher incidence of FP than patients with other underlying diseases (p < 0.05). The 19 FP patients also had a higher incidence of bacterial peritonitis than other PD patients (p < 0.01). Among the 20 FP episodes, 14 (70%) were preceded by antibiotic use, and eight (40%) developed during hospitalization. Steroids were used at the time of FP in five of six lupus patients. Seven patients (37%) died within 1 month after diagnosis of FP. Five patients were able to remain on PD after FP, but only three patients were able to maintain catheter placement. Conclusion: The risk factors for FP identified in this study include the rise of antibiotics and steroids, underlying lupus, frequent occurrence of bacterial peritonitis, and hospitalization. Antifungal therapy may allow the catheter to be kept in place in a few patients, but catheter removal should be considered in patients whose FP is refractory to medical treatment.

0033950332	Trace elements in blood and dialysate among continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients: A prospective, multicenter collaborative study	Trace elements (TEs) such as copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) may play an important role in normal physiology, while others such as aluminum (Al) and lead (Pb) may cause organ dysfunction. It is well known that there are differences in TE concentrations between renal failure patients and normal populations. The purpose of this study was to determine blood levels of various TEs in uremic patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Plasma levels of Al, Zn, and Cu, and blood levels of cadmium (Cd), Pb, and mercury (Hg), were measured in 51 CAPD patients and 153 apparently healthy control subjects. All of the CAPD patients had higher levels of Al, Cu, Cd, and Hg and lower levels of Zn; however, the levels of TEs, with the exception of Al, were within the accepted limits. Age only increased the levels of Cu and Hg, and the duration of CAPD was not correlated with the blood levels of any of the TEs tested. The fresh dialysis solution contained scant amounts of Al, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Hg, but higher levels of Zn were noted. Although TE levels among CAPD patients are either increased or decreased by the procedure, the concentrations remain within normal limits, with the exception of Al. The data from this study provide an insight for further studies of TE imbalance among CAPD patients. The consequence of a higher Zn concentration in the fresh dialysis solution deserves further observation.

41049104567	Quality of sleep and psychosocial factors for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis	◆ Objectives: Sleep disorders are common in end-stage renal disease patients. This study examined the relationship between self-reported quality of sleep (QoS) and certain psychosocial domains for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). ◆ Methods: The study subjects included 190 PD patients from 7 urban dialysis clinics in Northern Taiwan, from whom we obtained biochemical parameters and demographic data. QoS, quality of life (QoL), religious/ spiritual activity, and depression were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-36) for QoL, the Royal Free Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. ◆ Results: The average PSQI score was 9.1 ± 4.1 and, in total, 85.8% of all patients were poor sleepers (global PSQI ≥5). There was no difference in age, gender, and mode or duration of PD between good and poor sleepers. Biochemical data did not differ between the two groups. Widowed patients experienced significantly poorer QoS than patients with other marital status (PSQI scores: 12.3 ± 4.9 vs 8.88 ± 4.0, p = 0.006). The percentage of patients that held a bachelor's degree or above was significantly higher in good sleepers (55.6% vs 29.4%, p = 0.008). The PSQI value correlated negatively with the QoL scale in both physical (r= -0.295, p < 0.001) and mental domains (r = -0.410, p < 0.001), and correlated positively with the depression scale (r = 0.351, p < 0.001). There appeared to be no association between QoS and spiritual/religious activity (r = -0.097, p = 0.223). ◆ Conclusions: Psychosocial factors including depression, patients' perceptions regarding QoL, marital status, and educational background correlated significantly to the subjective QoS for PD patients. When dealing with sleep disorders in PD patients, physicians should pay considerable attention to their psychosocial backgrounds. Copyright © 2007 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.

84877858622	Microalbuminuria screening for detecting chronic kidney disease in the general population: A systematic review	Background: Microalbuminuria screening is widely used in high-risk populations but seldom used in the general population for detecting chronic kidney disease (CKD). Systematic reviews focused on screening for CKD are rare, and the issues about microalbuminuria screening in the general population have never been reviewed. We systematically reviewed studies regarding microalbuminuria screening and evaluated the benefits and harms of this screening method in the general population. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for English articles published from January 1970 to 13 December 2011. Quality assessments were performed using the QUADAS tool or the Drummond's 10-point checklist. Due to the high heterogeneity of the study designs, meta-analysis for the study results was not possible. Therefore, we performed a narrative synthesis. Results: Six articles from four studies made up our final study population, with four articles evaluating different screening methodologies and two reporting cost-effectiveness analyses. The qualities of the included articles ranged from fair to high. Spot urine albumin concentration and spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio had a similar diagnostic performance for microalbuminuria screening in the general population. Screening for microalbuminuria in high-risk populations, such as patients with diabetes, hypertension, or old age, was cost-effective. However, there was no consensus regarding the cost-effectiveness for microalbuminuria screening in the general population. Conclusions: Microalbuminuria screening in high-risk populations is cost-effective. However, the cost-effectiveness of screening for microalbuminuria in the general population deserves further study. To keep costs low, spot urine albumin concentration may be preferable than the albumin:creatinine ratio. Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

84877314261	Women on hemodialysis have lower self-reported health-related quality of life scores but better survival than men	Hemodialysis patients suffer from poor quality of life and survival. A retrospective cohort study was performed to examine the sex differences in selfreported quality of life and mortality in a Taiwanese hemodialysis cohort. Methods: A total of 816 stable hemodialysis patients were included. Patients completed two questionnaires: the 36-item Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36, Taiwan Standard Version 1.0) to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, Chinese Version) to assess depressive mood. Mortality outcomes were recorded for a seven-year follow-up period. Results: After adjustment for confounding factors, women had significantly higher BDI scores (P=.003), lower physical functioning (P<.001), bodily pain (P<.001), mental health (P=0007), and physical component scale (PCS) scores (P<.001). There were 284 deaths recorded. In the Cox-proportional hazard model, women had significantly lower mortality than men (P<.001). Conclusions: Women on hemodialysis had more depression-related symptoms and poor self-reported HRQoL, but better survival than men. The sex difference in psychological and HRQoL issues deserves greater concern because this relates to clinical care and further study. © 2012 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

84908010174	Acinetobacter peritoneal dialysis peritonitis: A changing landscape over time	Background: Acinetobacter species are assuming an increasingly important role in modern medicine, with their persistent presence in health-care settings and antibiotic resistance. However, clinical reports addressing this issue in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis are rare. Methods: All PD peritonitis episodes caused by Acinetobacter that occurred between 1985 and 2012 at a single centre were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features, microbiological data, and outcomes were analysed, with stratifications based upon temporal periods (before and after 2000). Results: Acinetobacter species were responsible for 26 PD peritonitis episodes (3.5% of all episodes) in 25 patients. A. baumannii was the most common pathogen (54%), followed by A. iwoffii (35%), with the former being predominant after 2000. Significantly more episodes resulted from breaks in exchange sterility after 2000, while those from exit site infections decreased (P = 0.01). The interval between the last and current peritonitis episodes lengthened significantly after 2000 (5 vs. 13.6 months; P = 0.05). All the isolates were susceptible to cefepime, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycosides, with a low ceftazidime resistance rate (16%). Nearly half of the patients (46%) required hospitalisation for their Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis, and 27% required an antibiotic switch. The overall outcome was fair, with no mortality and a 12% technique failure rate, without obvious interval differences. Conclusions: The temporal change in the microbiology and origin of Acinetobacter PD-associated peritonitis in our cohort suggested an important evolutional trend. Appropriate measures, including technique re-education and sterility maintenance, should be taken to decrease the Acinetobacter peritonitis incidence in PD patients.

44349142819	Impact of spiritual and religious activity on quality of sleep in hemodialysis patients	Background: Sleep disorders are common in hemodialysis (HD) patients. This study examined the relationship between quality of sleep (QoS) and religious/spiritual activity in HD patients. Methods: The study subjects were 861 HD patients from 14 dialysis clinics in Taiwan. QoS and religious/spiritual activity were evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire and the Royal Free Questionnaire respectively. Results: There was no difference in clinical parameters between the good and poor sleepers. Although total scores of religious and spiritual activity did not correlate with global PSQI score, patients who held strong 'spiritual' beliefs reported more problems in 'sleep disturbances', while those who exercised religious beliefs more strongly reported less trouble in 'daytime dysfunction'. Conclusion: There is no significant correlation between QoS and religious/spiritual activity globally. However, the spiritual and religious activity did associate with different components of QoS.

4544276821	The effect of iron stores on corrected QT dispersion in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis	Background: Arrhythmia and sudden death represent striking features in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Increased QT dispersion has been shown to be associated with arrhythmias. Abnormal excitability and heterogeneous cardiac iron deposition may cause the arrhythmogenesis of human siderotic heart disease. Iron overload and precipitation with its toxicity in cardiac muscles may, therefore, cause QT prolongation in dialysis patients. Methods: A total of 102 (65 women, 37 men; mean age, 47.7 ± 13.4 years) nondiabetic patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) were enrolled in this study. Another 102 subjects with a serum creatinine level less than 1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L) were used as matched control subjects. The PD patients were divided into 2 groups according to whether their computerized measurements of corrected QT (QTc) dispersion were longer than 74 ms. A value of 74 ms has been associated with risk for serious arrhythmias related to sudden death in dialysis patients. Results: The QTc dispersion of PD patients was significantly longer than that of the control subjects (69.8 ± 40.0 versus 55.2 ± 33.6 ms; P < 0.01). Thirty-eight PD patients with QTc dispersion longer than 74 ms had lower blood pressure (P = 0.01), fewer left ventricle masses (P = 0.036), and lower serum albumin levels (P = 0.046) but higher levels of serum calcium (P = 0.038) and transferrin saturation (TSAT; P = 0.022) than the other patients. Multivariate analysis identified TSAT as an independent factor for QTc dispersion (r = 0.432, P < 0.001). A linear relationship showed that at 74 ms of QTc dispersion, TSAT was 35.2%. Conclusion: Long-term PD patients have longer QTc dispersion than subjects with normal renal function. The high body iron stores in these patients increase the risk of increased QT dispersion. The concern over iron overload in dialysis patients is not only because of its oxidative toxicity, but also its precipitation of arrhythmias, which may be measured by the surrogate marker of QTc dispersion. © 2004 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

48749113184	Predictors of faster decline of residual renal function in Taiwanese peritoneal dialysis patients	◆ Objective: Loss of residual renal function (RRF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is a powerful predictor of mortality. The present study was conducted to determine the predictors of faster decline of RRF in PD patients in Taiwan. ◆ Methods: The study enrolled 270 patients starting PD between January 1996 and December 2005 in a single hospital in Taiwan. We calculated RRF as the mean of the sum of 24-hour urea and creatinine clearance. The slope of the decline of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was the main outcome measure. Data on demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment parameters; episodes of peritonitis; and hypotensive events were analyzed by Student t-test, Nann-Whitney U-test, and chi-square, as appropriate. All variables with statistical significance were included in a multivariate linear regression model to select the best predictors (p < 0.05) for faster decline of residual GFR. ◆ Results: All patients commencing PD during the study period were followed for 39.4 ± 24.0 months (median: 35.5 months).The average annual rate of decline of residual GFR was 1.377 ± 1.47 mL/min/m

We investigated the therapeutic effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on cellular apoptosis and matrix accumulation in HG-treated rat mesangial cells (RMCs). Methods: RMCs were cultured in media containing 5 (control) or 35 mM (HG) glucose. Cellular apoptosis was assayed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling staining. Collagen and transforming growth factor-1 gene expression were measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or Northern blotting. Mitochondrial capacity and intracellular ROS generation was assayed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Cellular ATP production and malondialdehyde (MDA) formation were determined by a luciferin-luciferase reaction and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Cytochrome c release, caspase activation and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage were assayed by Western blotting. Results: HG-treated RMCs displayed enhanced cellular apoptosis (65%) and collagen gene expression (1.8-fold increase); these reactions could be significantly suppressed by 1 mM NAC (p < 0.05). Intracellular ROS generation, production of ATP and MDA, and caspase-3, -8 and -9 activities were significantly increased in HG-treated RMCs, and were effectively attenuated by addition of NAC. Conclusion: It is concluded that NAC prevents HG-induced mesangial apoptosis and fibrogenesis pathways by the reduction of oxidative stress. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

51149106597	Initial glucose load predicts technique survival in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis	Background: A high glucose content in peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution may result in unfavorable changes on peritoneal character and worsened metabolic profiles. We conducted this retrospective cohort analysis to investigate the impact of initial glucose load on long-term outcomes of PD patients. Methods: A total of 90 patients newly started on PD were enrolled. All subjects were divided into low, medium, or high glucose load equally in patient number according to the average dialysate glucose concentration prescribed in the first 6 months from PD initiation. Cox's regression was used for survival analyses and linear regression was used for analyses of determinants for glucose load. Results: The mean follow-up period was 40.1 ± 11.8 months. Patients with higher glucose load showed a significantly worse cumulative technique survival (log rank p = 0.002). In Cox's regression analysis, patients with lower glucose load had significantly better technique survival (p = 0.035). In linear regression analysis, preexisting diabetes mellitus (p < 0.001), lower serum albumin (p = 0.012), and lower weekly renal Kt/V (p = 0.019) were significantly correlated with higher glucose load. Conclusions: Higher glucose load during the initial period of PD was associated with higher prevalent diabetes mellitus, lower serum albumin, and lower residual renal function, and effectively predicted worse survival of PD therapy.

57349099990	Randomized study of darbepoetin alfa and recombinant human erythropoietin for treatment of renal anemia in chronic renal failure patients receiving peroitoneal dialysis	Background/Purpose: Darbepoetin alfa can be administered less frequently than recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) for the treatment of anemia in chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. We aimed to confirm that darbepoetin alfa at a reduced dosing schedule can safely maintain a target hemoglobin level in CRF patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Forty-five PD patients receiving r-HuEPO were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to continue r-HuEPO or to change to darbepoetin alfa (open-label). Patients were maintained within a target range of hemoglobin for 5.5 months by adjusting the dose and then the frequency of darbepoetin alfa and r-HuEPO over the initial 4 months. The evaluation period was the final 1.5 months. A total of 37 patients completed the study. Results: During the evaluation period, the hemoglobin of the darbepoetin alfa group was higher than that in the baseline period (10.46 ± 0.22 g/ dL vs. 9.98 ± 0.18 g/dL, p < 0.05). Hemoglobin remained similar in the r-HuEPO group. The average dose in the darbepoetin alfa group was 93.0 μg/month, while the average dose in the r-HuEPO group was 18,339.9 units/month. The dosing frequency was less in the darbepoetin alfa group (3.9 times/month vs. 9.2 times/ month). We divided the darbepoetin alfa group into low-dose (< 70 μg/month) and high-dose (≥ 70 μg/month) subgroups. The body weight in the high-dose group was higher than that in the low-dose group (66 ± 11 kg vs. 52 ± 4.4 kg, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Both darbepoetin alfa and r-HuEPO safely maintain hemoglobin levels within the target range in peritoneal dialysis patients. © 2008 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

56749132083	Preservation of peritoneal morphology and function by pentoxifylline in a rat model of peritoneal dialysis: Molecular studies	Background. High-glucose (HG) content of dialysate accelerated peritoneal fibrosis. We investigated in vitro mechanisms and the in vivo potential of pentoxifylline (PTX) to prevent this fibrogenic process. Methods. For human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) culture, a normal-glucose (NG, 5.5 mM) or HG (138 mM) medium was established through pilot experiments. The rat peritoneal dialysis (PD) model consists of four groups (n = 8): group 1, intraperitoneal (IP) HG (4.25%) solution; group 2, as group 1 plus daily IP PTX (4 mg/in 1 h); group 3, IP PTX and group 4 as control. Results. In HPMC culture, PTX significantly prevented HG-stimulated gene and protein production of collagen and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (reduction rate of 72-81%). The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway was activated significantly in HG-treated HPMCs. Blockade of p38 MAPK by SB203580 (25 μM) or PTX (300 μg/ml) resulted in an effective suppression of collagen and TGF-β1 gene expression in HG-cultured HPMCs. In PD experimental animals, peritoneal thickness and collagen expression in the peritoneum were significantly increased in HG-treated rats, and was attenuated by PTX (P < 0.01). Impaired peritoneal ultrafiltration (1.9 ± 0.5 ml versus 2.4 ± 0.4 ml, P < 0.05) and stimulated proinflammatory IL-6, MCP-1 and TGF-β1 activation were observed in HG-treated rats. PTX well preserved the functional characteristics of peritoneum and cytokine profiles. Conclusions. These in vitro and in vivo data suggest that PTX may have therapeutic benefits for the prevention or retardation of peritoneal fibrosis. © The Author [2008].

58149131354	Lysophosphatidic acid and renal fibrosis	Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its specific G-protein-coupled receptors have mitogen-like activities in cellular signal transduction. At the intracellular level, LPA is produced by phospholipase A1 (PLA1) or PLA2; at the extracellular level, LPA is produced by autotaxin/ lysophospholipase D. Lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs) dephosphorylate LPA and thereby attenuate LPA signaling. Chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are significant public health issues throughout the world. In these conditions, there is a production and accumulation of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), leading to accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins and renal fibrosis. In addition, CKD risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and activation of the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system can lead to overexpression of the TGF-β-CTGF-collagen/fibronectin axis and thereby accelerate formation of renal fibrosis.

60249092220	Lercanidipine-induced chyloperitoneum in patients on peritoneal dialysis	◆ Objective: Lercanidipine is a lipophilic calcium channel blocker and a widely used antihypertensive agent. However, it can cause chyloperitoneum in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). The incidence, pathophysiology, and clinical impact of these adverse events are not known. ◆ Design: Retrospective study. ◆ Method: Patients were screened for use of antihypertensive agents. Those that had taken lercanidipine were identified and dialysate cholesterol (Chol) and triglyceride (TG) levels were checked. Serum levels were taken from the routine biochemistry record closest to the time of the dialysate levels. Dialysate Chol and TG from patients on other antihypertensives and with matched serum lipid profiles were compared. ◆ Patients: 14 of 222 patients had taken lercanidipine during February 2005 to January 2006, accounting for 12% of all patients on calcium channel blockers in our PD center. ◆ Results: Of 14 patients prescribed lercanidipine, 8 (57%) developed chyloperitoneum. None had peritonitis and the dialysate was clear under microscopic examination. Mean dialysate TG was 128.4 ± 133.0 mg/dL and mean dialysate Chol was 18.2 ± 24.9 mg/ dL in patients that developed chyloperitoneum. These patients were also noted to have higher blood TG and Chol than patients that did not develop chyloperitoneum. In contrast, patients on other antihypertensive agents with matched blood TG and Chol levels had low dialysate TG levels and zero dialysate Chol. ◆ Conclusion: Lercanidipine frequently causes chyloperitoneum in Taiwanese PD patients. The risk of developing this adverse event seems to be related to the blood lipid profile. The mechanism of this phenomenon is worthy of further investigation.

65549118896	Intraperitoneal vascular endothelial growth factor C level is related to peritoneal dialysis ultrafiltration	Background: Local inflammation and neovascularization have a negative influence on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Patients with higher peritoneal transport have higher interleukin-6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) levels in their dialysate. However, the relationship of other members of the VEGF family, such as VEGF-C, to peritoneal transport or ultrafiltration (UF) is yet to be studied. Methods: Peritoneal cytokine and growth factor levels were determined during the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Ultrafiltration, peritoneal clearance and residual renal function were also considered. Results: Forty-two PD patients were enrolled. They had been on PD for at least 1 month and free of peritonitis for at least 1 month prior to the study. Patients with high or high average PET had higher dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C. Dialysate IL-6 and VEGF-C correlated negatively with PET and UF. Conclusions: Dialysate VEGF-C is related to higher transport rate and poorer UF. The role of VEGF-C in PD deserves further study. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

66649100815	Rupture of pectoralis major muscle in an elderly patient receiving long-term hemodialysis: Case report and literature review	Total or near-total rupture of the pectoralis major muscle is rare. It has mainly occurred in male patients between 20 - 40 years of age while performing weight-lifting. Major tendon rupture is a rare but well-documented complication of longterm dialysis. However, rupture of pectoralis major in dialysis patients had never been reported before. Here, we present a pectoralis major rupture in an elderly patient receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Both old age and long-term dialysis could be risk factors of rupture. The clinicians should pay more attention to this complication when taking care of elderly patients on hemodialysis. © 2009 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

69249098826	Rate of decline of residual renal function is associated with all-cause mortality and technique failure in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis	Background. Residual renal function (RRF) at the initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy can predict patient outcome. However, RRF declines with time at variable rates in different patients. This study was performed to compare the impact of baseline RRF and the rate of RRF decline on patient survival and on death-censored technique survival after initiation of long-term PD.Methods. We enrolled 270 patients with sufficient urine amount (daily urine volume >100 mL) from a medical centre in North Taiwan who began PD between January 1996 and December 2005 and followed them until December 2007. The study population was stratified by the decline rate of RRF into a fast, intermediate and slow decline group. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine patient survival and technique survival. The Cox regression model was used to identify factors associated with patient outcome. The proportional odds polychotomous logistic regression model was used to identify variables associated with rapid decline of RRF.Results. During an average follow-up period of 45 months, 50 (18.5) deaths, 67 (24.8) death-censored technique failures (transfer to haemodialysis) and 43 (15.9) renal transplantations occurred.

70349498730	Skin color is associated with insulin resistance in nondiabetic peritoneal dialysis patients	◆ Background: Changes in skin color are common among dialysis patients. They are associated with urochrome pigments, hemoglobin, and changes in cutaneous vasculature. Insulin resistance (IR) is strongly linked to cutaneous vascular dysfunction and is prevalent in dialysis patients. We postulated skin color may be associated with IR in dialysis patients because of the alternation in cutaneous vasculature. ◆ Methods: 50 nondiabetic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were recruited for measurements of skin color by the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE; International Commission on Illumination) system ("L" "a" "b" system).

Studies of the infectious complications and outcomes among such SLE patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) are limited. ◆ Design: A retrospective age- and gender-matched case control study. ◆ Setting: A university teaching hospital. ◆ Patients: There were 23 SLE patients with ESRD receiving PD for more than 3 months during the past 15 years. Another 46 age- and gender-matched non-SLE nondiabetic patients receiving PD were selected as the control group in this study. ◆ Intervention: All patients underwent PD as renal replacement therapy and were regularly followed up at this hospital. ◆ Main Outcome Measures: Technique survival and incidences of exit-site infection (ESI) and peritonitis in these patients. ◆ Results: The SLE patients had a lower predialysis serum albumin than the control group (3.16 ± 0.50 g/dL vs 3.52 ± 0.50 g/dL, p < 0.01). The incidences of exit-site infection (ESI) and peritonitis were higher for SLE patients than for control patients (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that SLE patients had shorter time intervals to first infectious complications, and poorer technique survival. Infection was the major cause of dropout and mortality in the SLE patients. The SLE patients had a reduced chance of receiving a renal transplant. The use of steroids by SLE patients was associated with a higher incidence of peritonitis (p = 0.04), but association with ESI was insignificant. In a Cox regression model, the underlying SLE was the only risk factor for technique failure and time interval to first infectious complication. ◆ Conclusion: SLE patients undergoing PD are more susceptible to infection than age- and gender-matched non-SLE nondiabetic patients and have poorer technique survival. Systemic lupus erythematosus itself may further compromise the immunity of uremic patients.

0034791659	Hormones-Cytokines-Cignaling: Dipyridamole inhibits TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression in human peritoneal mesothelial cells	Background. Peritoneal matrix accumulation is characteristic of peritoneal fibrosis (PF). Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients who had persistent transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in their drained effluent had an increased risk of PF. We previously reported that TGF-β stimulates the expression of types I and III collagen mRNA in cultured human peritoneal mesangial cells (HPMCs), which may predispose them to develop PF. Pharmacological interventions to attenuate TGF-β-stimulated matrix accumulation in HPMC may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of PF. The SMAD family and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2, p44/p42) pathways have been shown to participate in TGF-β signaling. Our current study identified these signal pathways in HPMCs and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effects of dipyridamole on TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression in HPMCs. Methods. HPMCs were cultured from human omentum by an enzyme digestion method. Expression of collagen α1(I) mRNA was determined by Northern blotting. The SMAD proteins and the ERK1/2 activity were determined by Western blotting. Results. TGF-β-stimulated collagen α1(I) mRNA expression of HPMC was inhibited by dipyridamole in a dose-dependent manner. Smad2 and ERK1/2 were activated in response to TGF-β; however, TGF-β had little effect on the protein expression of Smad4. The addition of PD98059, which blocked activation of ERK1/2, suppressed TGF-β-induced collagen α1(I) mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration that inhibited collagen gene expression (17 μg/mL), dipyridamole suppressed ERK1/2 activation by TGF-β. In contrast, the same concentration of dipyridamole had no effect on TGF-β-induced activation of Smad2. Conclusion. Dipyridamole inhibits TGF-β-induced collagen gene expression in HPMC through modulation of the ERK pathway. Our study of dipyridamole may provide therapeutic basis for clinical applications in the prevention of PF.

0035097560	Comparison of infectious complications in peritoneal dialysis patients using either a twin-bag system or automated peritoneal dialysis	Background. Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and twin-bag (TB) systems are two major peritoneal dialysis (PD) modalities. Published data comparing the infectious complications of these modalities is limited. Subjects and methods. Ninety-five patients using APD (the APD group) and 117 patients using TB system (the TB group) were recruited. Among them, 35 patients used both modalities. The two groups' clinical characteristics, incidences of infectious complications, and the time intervals to first PD-related infection were compared. Results. Clinical characteristics, incidence of exit-site infection (ESI), and time intervals to first ESI were similar in the TB and APD groups. The incidence of peritonitis in the APD group (1.22 episodes/100 patients-months) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that of the TB group (2.28 episodes/100 patient-months). Using the Cox proportional hazard model, APD was found to have a lower risk of peritonitis relative to TB systems, with marginal significance (RR 0.58, P=0.051). Conclusion. APD was found to have a lower peritonitis rate than the TB system. Since reducing the peritonitis rate helps to maintain technical survival during PD, from this viewpoint, APD may be preferred for patients undergoing PD, unless contraindicated.

77957689574	Risk factors for high dialysate glucose use in pd patients-a retrospective 5-year cohort study	Background: Use of high concentrations of glucose for peritoneal dialysis (PD) may produce unfavorable results. Our previous study showed that high initial glucose load is associated with poor PD technique survival. Objective: This retrospective cohort study at a medical center in Taiwan aimed to understand the factors associated with high glucose load in long-term PD patients. Patients and Methods: We reviewed 90 newly started PD patients over 5 years. We determined glucose load by calculating annual glucose weight and dialysate volume administered. Multiple linear regression analyses with time-dependent covariates were used to determine factors that influence the annual average dialysate glucose concentration. Results: The study group included 47 men and 43 women with a mean age of 53.4 ± 13.9 years. Technique survival rates were 91.0%, 84.1%, and 77.6% at the beginning of the second, third, and fourth year of PD therapy respectively. The presence of diabetes mellitus (DM), high body mass index (BMI), and low weekly renal Kt/V were significantly correlated with high average dialysate glucose concentration during the first, second, and third years. For patients undergoing PD for more than 3 years, residual renal function (RRF) deteriorated, and only DM significantly affected higher dialysate glucose concentration in the fourth year. Conclusions: Patients with DM, high BMI, and low RRF were more likely to require a high glucose load for PD therapy, especially during the first 3 years. After those 3 years of PD, DM was the only significant factor in the need for higher glucose load. To reduce the glucose load in chronic PD patients, alternative osmotic agents such as icodextrin or amino acids should be considered in the daily PD regimen. © 2010 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis.

78049441696	Benefits of Sevelamer on Markers of Bone Turnover in Taiwanese Hemodialysis Patients	Background/Purpose: Sevelamer hydrochloride is a recently developed phosphate binder, which is a quaternary amine anion exchanger without calcium or aluminum. Sevelamer is effective in controlling hyperphosphatemia without increasing the calcium load in chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients. We investigated whether sevelamer restored bone metabolism in chronic HD patients. Methods: An 8-week, prospective, open-label, randomized study was conducted after a 2-week washout period in chronic hyperphosphatemic HD patients. This study compared the effect of sevelamer on markers of bone turnover with that of calcium acetate, as stratified by baseline serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level. Results: There was no difference in the changes of serum phosphorus, calcium-phosphorus product and serum iPTH between the sevelamer and the calcium acetate groups. However, more hypercalcemic events (12%) were documented under calcium acetate treatment. In patients with hypoparathyroidism, calcium acetate treatment decreased serum iPTH at the end of the study, while sevelamer did not. Increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels were found among patients receiving sevelamer treatment compared with those who received calcium acetate treatment. In those patients receiving sevelamer, the serum alkaline phosphatase level was also positively correlated to the sevelamer dosage (r = 0.246, p = 0.013). Conclusion: Sevelamer effectively reduces serum phosphorus with a lower incidence of hypercalcemic effects in HD patients. Sevelamer is an effective means of treatment for chronic hyperphosphatemic HD patients, especially those with hypoparathyroidism. © 2010 Formosan Medical Association & Elsevier.

78549249550	Life expectancy, expected years of life lost and survival of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients	Background: Expected years of life lost (EYLL) in dialysis patients are rarely discussed. This study compared life expectancy, EYLL and survival between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods: Adults who underwent maintenance dialysis at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1995 to 2006 were followed up until December 2007. Kaplan-Meier analysis and a constant excess hazard model were used to estimate and project long-term survival. EYLL was calculated by subtracting the life expectancy of patients from that of age- and sex-matched referents. HD patients were then matched with PD patients on age, sex and diabetes mellitus (DM). Life expectancy, EYLL and survival between the 2 groups were compared. Mortality risks were determined by the Cox model. Results: Before matching, the 305 HD patients were older than the 428 PD patients (62.4 ± 13.7 vs. 53.1 ± 16.7 years; p<0.0001). More HD patients had DM (HD vs. PD, 29.2% vs. 20.6%; p=0.0072). Life expectancy and EYLL of HD patients were 8.8 and 11.5 years, compared with those of PD patients (19.9 and 7.4 years). After matching, life expectancy (p=0.790) and EYLL (p=0.793) of both groups (236 patients each) were similar. Age (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05-1.09) and DM (AHR=3.81; 95% CI, 2.28-6.36) were independent mortality predictors. For diabetic patients who underwent HD, a better survival rate was observed (AHR=0.24; 95% CI, 0.11-0.53). Conclusions: After matching, HD and PD patients had similar life expectancy and EYLL. Survival was better for diabetic patients if they received HD. © 2010 Società Italiana di Nefrologia.

Here, we performed a secondary analysis of a prospectively enrolled cohort of adult patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) at a medical center and its two affiliate hospitals between 2003 and 2007. We excluded patients with stage 5 CKD or those who received dialysis previously. We defined proteinuria, measured with a dipstick, as mild (trace to 1+) or heavy (2+ to 4+). Among a total of 1052 patients, cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) developed in 183 (17.4%) patients and required renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 50 (4.8%) patients. In a multiple logistic regression model, mild and heavy proteinuria each associated with an increased odds of CSA-AKI, independent of CKD stage and the presence of diabetes mellitus (mild: OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.52; heavy: OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.90). Heavy proteinuria also associated with increased odds of postoperative RRT (OR 7.29, 95% CI 3.00 to 17.73). In summary, these data suggest that preoperative proteinuria is a predictor of CSA-AKI among patients undergoing CABG. Copyright © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

78651400159	Tamoxifen downregulates connective tissue growth factor to ameliorate peritoneal fibrosis	Peritoneal fibrosis (PF), including simple sclerosis and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), is a serious complication in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis. Tamoxifen has successfully been used in treating EPS; however, the mechanism of tamoxifen in treating EPS fibrosis disorders remains unclear. This study demonstrates a possible antifibrotic mechanism of tamoxifen. A bleach-induced PF rat model was applied as the in vivo treatment target. Tamoxifen was intraperitoneally injected daily to treat PF. The PF scores and thickness of the submesothelial zone over the liver surface were measured as indicators for the severity of PF. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMC) were used as an in vitro model to test the antifibrotic effect of tamoxifen. Gene expressions of transforming growth factors-β (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and collagen were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. In HPMC, tamoxifen showed paradoxical effects between collagen I and TGF-β. Tamoxifen also inhibited TGF-β-induced collagen and CTGF. The possible antifibrotic effect of tamoxifen is through inhibiting CTGF to block collagen synthesis, although it enhances TGF-β which increases fibrosis. These results provide a possible molecular mechanism for tamoxifen. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG.

79551518906	Application of speckle-tracking echocardiography in detecting coronary artery disease in patients with maintenance hemodialysis	Background: Satisfactory and noninvasive diagnostic tools for coronary artery disease (CAD) are not available in hemodialysis patients. We aimed to elucidate a reliable tool to diagnose CAD in these patients. Methods: 102 hemodialysis patients received 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography with left ventricular (LV) strain analysis and blood tests for cardiac troponin T, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-18. Results: The levels of biomarkers did not differ between patients with and without CAD. The factors associated with CAD were decreased circumferential strain, decreased global longitudinal strain, and the number of LV segments with decreased longitudinal strain. Logistic regression analyses showed that the number of LV segments with decreased longitudinal strain, over 6 segments, was strongly associated with CAD in hemodialysis patients (OR 12.08, 95% CI 3.724-39.209).

79957888137	Impact of timing of renal replacement therapy initiation on outcome of septic acute kidney injury	Introduction: Sepsis is the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical patients. The optimal timing of initiating renal replacement therapy (RRT) in septic AKI patients remains controversial. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of early or late initiation of RRT, as defined using the simplified RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney function, and end-stage renal failure) classification (sRIFLE), on hospital mortality among septic AKI patients.Methods: Patient with sepsis and AKI requiring RRT in surgical intensive care units were enrolled between January 2002 and October 2009. The patients were divided into early (sRIFLE-0 or -Risk) or late (sRIFLE-Injury or -Failure) initiation of RRT by sRIFLE criteria. Cox proportional hazard ratios for in hospital mortality were determined to assess the impact of timing of RRT.Results: Among the 370 patients, 192 (51.9%) underwent early RRT and 259 (70.0%) died during hospitalization. The mortality rate in early and late RRT groups were 70.8% and 69.7% respectively (P > 0.05). Early dialysis did not relate to hospital mortality by Cox proportional hazard model (P > 0.05). Patients with heart failure, male gender, higher admission creatinine, and operation were more likely to be in the late RRT group. Cox proportional hazard model, after adjustment with propensity score including all patients based on the probability of late RRT, showed early dialysis was not related to hospital mortality. Further model matched patients by 1:1 fashion according to each patient's propensity to late RRT showed no differences in hospital mortality according to head-to-head comparison of demographic data (P > 0.05).Conclusions: Use of sRIFLE classification as a marker poorly predicted the benefits of early or late RRT in the context of septic AKI. In the future, more physiologically meaningful markers with which to determine the optimal timing of RRT initiation should be identified. © 2011 Chou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

82855164039	Endoplasmic reticulum stress implicated in the development of renal fibrosis	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated apoptosis plays a role in organ remodeling after insult. The effect of ER stress on renal tubular damage and fibrosis remains controversial. This study aims to investigate whether ER stress is involved in tubular destruction and interstitial fibrosis in vivo. Renal cell apoptosis was proven by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) stain and poly-ADP ribose polymerase expression in the unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidney. ER stress was evoked and confirmed by the upregulation of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and the common Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu (KDEL) motif of ER retention proteins after UUO. ER stress-associated proapoptotic signals, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/lymphoma 2-associated × protein (BAX) expression, caspase-12 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, were activated in the UUO kidney. Prolonged ER stress attenuated both unsplicing and splicing X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) protein expression, but continued to activate inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α)-JNK phosphorylation, protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α subunit (eIF2α), activating transcription factor (ATF)-4, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) and cleavage activating transcription factor 6 (cATF6)-CHOP signals, which induce ER stress-related apoptosis but attenuate adaptive unfolded protein responses in UUO kidneys. However, renal apoptosis and fibrosis were attenuated in candesartan-treated UUO kidney. Candesartan was associated with maintenance of XBP-1 expression and attenuated ATF4, cATF6 and CHOP protein expression. Taken together, results show that overwhelming ER stress leads to renal cell apoptosis and subsequent fibrosis; and candesartan, at least in part, restores renal integrity by blocking ER stress-related apoptosis. Reducing ER stress may present a way to attenuate renal fibrosis. © 2011 The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.

84055177636	A computer-aided method for automatic localization and thickness measurement of peritoneum in ultrasound images	This paper presents a method of automatically measuring peritoneum thickness in ultrasound images. In our previous work, a method of manually selecting the region of interest (ROI) area has been developed. To achieve an automatic ROI area selection, two phases: Gaussian high-pass filtering and bilateral filtering, are used in the proposed method. In the bilateral filtering phase, the ultrasound image is enhanced for obtaining more details of the peritoneum so that probable areas can be extracted. In the other phase, the ultrasound image is processed with a Gaussian high pass filter, and the result is used to locate the precise area of peritoneum in the first phase result. The experimental results show that the proposed method has high accuracy and fast processing speed in determining the peritoneum area and its thickness distribution. © 2011 IEEE.

84856102509	Safety issues of long-term glucose load in patients on peritoneal dialysis-A 7-year cohort study	Background: Effects of long-term glucose load on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patient safety and outcomes have seldom been reported. This study demonstrates the influence of long-term glucose load on patient and technique survival. Methods: We surveyed 173 incident PD patients. Long-term glucose load was evaluated by calculating the average dialysate glucose concentration since initiation of PD. Risk factors were assessed by fitting Cox's models with repeatedly measured time-dependent covariates. Results: We noted that older age, higher glucose concentration, and lower residual renal function (RRF) were significantly associated with a worse patient survival. We found that female gender, absence of diabetes, lower glucose concentration, use of icodextrin, higher serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and higher RRF were significantly associated with a better technique survival. Conclusions: Long-term glucose load predicted mortality and technique failure in chronic PD patients. These findings emphasize the importance of minimizing glucose load in PD patients. © 2012 Wu et al.

84859543673	Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance as risk factors for development of chronic kidney disease and rapid decline in renal function in elderly	Context: Studies addressing the association of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance with the risks of incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the progression of renal function were either lacking or inconclusive. Objective: The aim of this study was to define the effect of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance on the development of new CKD and the decline in renal function. Design and Setting: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary university-based hospital in Taiwan. Patients and Other Participants: We studied a total of 1456 Asians 65 or older who were followed for an average of 3.15 yr. Within the cohort, we measured insulin resistance using the homeostasis model assessment formula in 652 nondiabetic participants. Interventions: There were no interventions. Main Outcome Measures: We measured the prevalence and incidence of CKD and the annual decline of the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Results: We found that the adjusted odds ratio for prevalent CKD in association with metabolic syndrome was 1.778 (95% confidence interval, 1.188 to 2.465), the hazard ratio for rapid decline in renal function was 1.042 (0.802-1.355), and the hazard ratio for incident CKD was 1.931 (1.175-3.174). With each one-unit increment of insulin resistance, the odds ratio of prevalent CKD and proteinuria were raised 1.312-fold (1.114 to 1.545) and 1.278-fold (1.098 to 1.488), respectively. Insulin resistance was not associated with incident CKD. Increment of insulin resistance per unit was associated with 1.16-fold (1.06 to 1.26) elevation in the hazard ratios of the decline in renal function. Conclusions: Metabolic syndrome predicts the risks of prevalent and incident CKD, whereas insulin resistance is associated with prevalent CKD and rapid decline in renal function in elderly individuals.

84864282416	Increased procollagen type i C-terminal peptide levels indicate diastolic dysfunction in end-stage renal disease patients undergoing maintenance dialysis therapy	Background: Cardiac dysfunction is common among patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to explore the determinants of diastolic dysfunction in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis. Methods: Patients with asymptomatic end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis underwent Doppler tissue imaging analysis and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography with strain analysis. Blood studies included albumin, cardiac troponin T, and procollagen type I C-terminal peptide (PICP). Results: All enrolled patients had left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction and were stratified into two groups by a cutoff value of 13 for the ratio of early transmitral flow velocity to the average early diastolic annular velocity (E/e′). Seventy-two of the enrolled patients (87%) had grade 1 diastolic dysfunction, and 11 patients (13%) had higher grades of diastolic dysfunction. The study population did not include a representative sample of patients with the pseudonormal or restrictive filling patterns of diastolic dysfunction. There were no significant differences in gender, age, LV geometric change, ejection fraction, global systolic longitudinal strain and strain rate, and prevalence of comorbidities between groups. Patients with average E/e′ ≥ 13 had higher PICP, which was significantly correlated with cardiac troponin T, average E/e′, and systolic circumferential strain rate. By multivariate regression analysis, average E/e′ level was an independent factor of PICP level (P =.047). Conclusions: Hemodialysis patients with high average E/e′ ratios showed increased levels of LV filling pressure and higher severity levels of cardiac fibrosis, which occurred before the development of systolic dysfunction. PICP was a potential indicator of diastolic dysfunction and increased LV filling pressure. © 2012 American Society of Echocardiography.

84865477083	U-Curve Association between Timing of Renal Replacement Therapy Initiation and In-Hospital Mortality in Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury	Background: Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor outcomes in surgical patients. This study aims to evaluate whether the timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation affects the in-hospital mortality of patients with postoperative AKI. Methodology: This multicenter retrospective observational study, which was conducted in the intensive care units (ICUs) in a tertiary hospital (National Taiwan University Hospital) and its branch hospitals in Taiwan between January, 2002, and April, 2009, included adult patients with postoperative AKI who underwent RRT for predefined indications. The demographic data, comorbid diseases, types of surgery and RRT, and the indications for RRT were documented. Patients were categorized according to the period of time between the ICU admission and RRT initiation as the early (EG, ≦1 day), intermediate (IG, 2-3 days), and late (LG, ≧4 days) groups. The in-hospital mortality rate censored at 180 day was defined as the endpoint. Results: Six hundred forty-eight patients (418 men, mean age 63.0±15.9 years) were enrolled, and 379 patients (58.5%) died during the hospitalization. Both the estimated probability of death and the in-hospital mortality rates of the three groups represented U-curves. According to the Cox proportional hazard method, LG (hazard ratio, 1.527; 95% confidence interval, 1.152-2.024; P = 0.003, compared with IG group), age (1.014; 1.006-1.021), diabetes (1.279; 1.022-1.601; P = 0.031), cirrhosis (2.147; 1.421-3.242), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (1.811; 1.391-2.359), initial neurological dysfunction (1.448; 1.107-1.894; P = 0.007), pre-RRT mean arterial pressure (0.988; 0.981-0.995), inotropic equivalent (1.006; 1.001-1.012; P = 0.013), APACHE II scores (1.055; 1.037-1.073), and sepsis (1.939; 1.536-2.449) were independent predictors of the in-hospital mortality (All P<0.001 except otherwise stated). Conclusions: The current study found a U-curve association between the timing of the RRT initiation after the ICU admission and patients' in-hospital mortalities, and alerts physicians of certain factors affecting the outcome after the RRT initiation. © 2012 Shiao et al.

0036896553	Association between serum aspartate transaminase and homocysteine levels in hemodialysis patients	Background: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a common metabolic abnormality in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). An impairment of remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) is seen in these patients but cannot account completely for hyperhomocysteinemia. Homocysteine is derived from transmethylation of methionine that can be metabolized through transamination pathway alternatively. However, the significance of transamination in the metabolism of Hcy in HD patients is not studied. Methods: A total of 145 patients undergoing HD for more than 3 months were enrolled in the study. Vitamins B were not prescribed routinely to these patients. Among them, 49 patients had positive test results for hepatitis B surface antigen or antihepatitis C virus antibody.

84869096106	Risk factors for herpes zoster reactivation in maintenance hemodialysis patients	Objective: Herpes zoster (HZ) reactivation is common in immunocompromised patients. Advanced renal failure is also reportedly associated with impairment of cellular immunity. There is not any study yet assessing risk factors of HZ reactivation in hemodialysis patients. Methods: All patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for more than 3 months and who developed HZ between 2000/01/01 and 2009/12/31 in a tertiary referral medical center were identified, and matched 1:1 to hemodialysis patients without HZ by age and gender. Multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression model was constructed to determine possible risk factors. Results: Out of a total of 126 maintenance hemodialysis patients (65.3% female), 63 belonged to the HZ reactivation group and 63 to the age/sex matched control patients. Conditional logistic regression model linked corticosteroid use with heightened risk (odds ratio [OR] 20.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-125.6; p = 0.002), while iron therapy and 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D were associated with significantly lower likelihood of developing HZ (OR 0.12, 95%CI 0.0-0.6; p = 0.01, and OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.0-0.4; p = 0.005 respectively). Conclusions: Use of iron preparations and 1α-hydroxylated vitamin D is potentially associated with less risk of developing HZ reactivation in maintenance hemodialysis patients. © 2012 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

84868383108	Differential association of proinflammatory cytokines with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in subjects with and without continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis	Background and aims: The association between inflammation and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and non-CAPD patients is not established. The objective of this study was to test the above association and whether inflammation interacts with CAPD to increase LV diastolic dysfunction risks. Methods and results: 120 subjects with normal creatinine levels and 101 CAPD patients were recruited. Echocardiographic parameters were assessed in all patients. The participants were classified as having LV diastolic dysfunction by echocardiographic findings including mitral inflow E/. A ratio < 1, deceleration time > 220 cm/s, or decreased peak annular early diastolic velocity in tissue Doppler imaging. Blood was sampled at the baseline for measurement of inflammation markers, including tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Subjects with LV diastolic dysfunction had higher proinflammation cytokines levels in both groups. Inflamed markers correlated significantly with echocardiography parameters for LV diastolic dysfunction in patients receiving CAPD. In a multivariate regression analysis adjusting for all the factors associated with LV diastolic dysfunction, inflammation is still significantly associated with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (TNF-alpha, OR: 2.6, 95% CI: 2.0-3.35, p < 0.001; IL-6, OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.25-1.26, p = 0.01). In addition, the interaction of CAPD and inflammation significantly contributed to the development of LV diastolic dysfunction (CAPD* TNF-α: OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.13-1.79, P = 0.004). Conclusion: We found inflammation plays a vital role for LV diastolic dysfunction especially in CAPD patients. A synergistic effect between CAPD and inflammation, especially TNF-α, would further aggravate LV diastolic dysfunction. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84872876246	Lean Body Mass Predicts Long-Term Survival in Chinese Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis	Background: Reduced lean body mass (LBM) is one of the main indicators in malnutrition inflammation syndrome among patients on dialysis. However, the influence of LBM on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients' outcomes and the factors related to increasing LBM are seldom reported. Methods: We enrolled 103 incident PD patients between 2002 and 2003, and followed them until December 2011. Clinical characteristics, PD-associated parameters, residual renal function, and serum chemistry profiles of each patient were collected at 1 month and 1 year after initiating PD. LBM was estimated using creatinine index corrected with body weight. Multiple linear regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and Cox regression proportional hazard analysis were used to define independent variables and compare survival between groups. Results: Using the median LBM value (70% for men and 64% for women), patients were divided into group 1 (n = 52; low LBM) and group 2 (n = 51; high LBM). Group 1 patients had higher rates of peritonitis (1.6 vs. 1.1/100 patient months; p<0.05) and hospitalization (14.6 vs. 9.7/100 patient months; p<0.05). Group 1 patients also had shorter overall survival and technique survival (p<0.01). Each percentage point increase in LBM reduced the hazard ratio for mortality by 8% after adjustment for diabetes, age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Changes in residual renal function and protein catabolic rate were independently associated with changes in LBM in the first year of PD. Conclusions: LBM serves as a good parameter in addition to BMI to predict the survival of patients on PD. Preserving residual renal function and increasing protein intake can increase LBM. © 2013 Huang et al.

84874630657	Glycosylated Hemoglobin and Albumin-Corrected Fructosamine Are Good Indicators for Glycemic Control in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients	Purpose: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease and is an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality after dialysis. However, glycemic control among such patients is difficult to assess. The present study examined glycemic control parameters and observed glucose variation after refilling different kinds of fresh dialysate in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods: A total of 25 DM PD patients were recruited, and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) was applied to measure interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose levels at 5-min intervals for 3 days. Patients filled out diet and PD fluid exchange diaries. The records measured with CGMS were analyzed and correlated with other glycemic control parameters such as fructosamine, albumin-corrected fructosamine (AlbF), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glycated albumin levels. Results: There were significant correlations between mean ISF glucose and fructosamine (r = 0.45, P<0.05), AlbF (r = 0.54, P<0.01), and HbA1c (r = 0.51, P<0.01). The ISF glucose levels in glucose-containing dialysate increased from approximately 7-8 mg/dL within 1 hour of exchange in contrast to icodextrin dialysate which kept ISF glucose levels unchanged. Conclusion: HbA1c and AlbF significantly correlated with the mean ISF glucose levels, indicating that they are reliable indices of glycemic control in DM PD patients. Icodextrin dialysate seems to have a favorable glycemic control effect when compared to the other glucose-containing dialysates. © 2013 Lee et al.

84878009721	Peritoneal dialysis peritonitis by anaerobic pathogens: A retrospective case series	Background: Bacterial infections account for most peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis episodes. However, anaerobic PD peritonitis is extremely rare and intuitively associated with intra-abdominal lesions. In this study, we examined the clinical characteristics of PD patients who developed anaerobic peritonitis. Methods. We retrospectively identified all anaerobic PD peritonitis episodes from a prospectively collected PD registry at a single center between 1990 and 2010. Only patients receiving more than 3 months of PD were enrolled. We analyzed clinical features as well as outcomes of anaerobic PD peritonitis patients. Results: Among 6 patients, 10 episodes of PD-associated peritonitis were caused by anaerobic pathogens (1.59% of all peritonitis episodes during study the period), in which the cultures from 5 episodes had mixed growth. Bacteroides fragilis was the most common species identified (4 isolates). Only 3 episodes were associated with gastrointestinal lesions, and 4 episodes were related to a break in sterility during exchange procedures. All anaerobic pathogens were susceptible to clindamycin and metronidazole, but penicillin resistance was noted in 4 isolates. Ampicillin/sulbactam resistance was found in 2 isolates. In 5 episodes, a primary response was achieved using the first-generation cephalosporin and ceftazidime or aminoglycoside. In 3 episodes, the first-generation cephalosporin was replaced with aminoglycosides. Tenckhoff catheter removal was necessary in 2 episodes. Only one episode ended with mortality (due to a perforated bowel). Conclusion: Anaerobic PD-associated peritonitis might be predominantly caused by contamination, rather than intra-abdominal events. Half of anaerobic PD-associated peritonitis episodes had polymicrobial growth. The overall outcome of anaerobic peritonitis is fair, with a high catheter survival rate. © 2013 Chao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84877679472	Dissecting the Mechanisms of Left Ventricular Diastolic Dysfunction and Inflammation in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients	Objective: Patients with symptoms of heart failure and preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function are commonly encountered in clinical practice especially in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We hypothesized that adiposity might influence LV diastolic function through systemic inflammation in this specific group. Methods: We designed a cross-sectional study in 173 prevalent PD patients. LV diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed by echocardiography. PD patient without LV diastolic dysfunction served as the control group. Serum inflammatory biomarkers were examined including tissue necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The location and amount of adipose tissue were assessed by computerized tomography (CT) at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra. Results: Subjects with LV diastolic dysfunction had higher levels of the pro-inflammation cytokines and more visceral and peritoneal fat (all P<0.001) than control subjects. A significant correlation was found between visceral adipose tissue and pro-inflammatory cytokines (r = 0.70; P<0.001). Multivariable regression analysis found that the relationship between visceral adipose tissue and LV diastolic dysfunction became insignificant when either TNF-α or IL-6 were introduced into the model, although TNF-α and IL-6 were both significantly associated with LV diastolic dysfunction even after adjusting for visceral fat (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.09-2.02; P = 0.033 and OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.09-1.82; P = 0.031, respectively). Conclusions: Larger amounts of adipose tissue were associated with higher serum pro-inflammatory levels in PD patients, which might be related to the development of LV diastolic dysfunction. Modulating inflammatory reactions in PD patients can be a useful therapeutic approach for managing LV diastolic dysfunction. © 2013 Wu et al.

84878668080	Metabolic syndrome and abdominal fat are associated with inflammation, but not with clinical outcomes, in peritoneal dialysis patients	Background: In the general population, metabolic syndrome (MetS) is correlated with visceral fat and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, little is known about the significance of abdominal fat and its association with inflammation and medication use in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We investigated the relationship of visceral fat area (VFA) with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and medication use in PD patients and followed their clinical outcomes.Methods: In a prospective study from February 2009 to February 2012, we assessed diabetes mellitus (DM) status, clinical and PD-associated characteristics, medication use, CRP levels, components of MetS, and VFA in 183 PD patients. These patients were categorized into 3 groups based on MetS and DM status: non-MetS (group 1, n = 73), MetS (group 2, n = 65), and DM (group 3, n = 45). VFA was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and corrected for body mass index (BMI).Results: Patients in group 1 had smaller VFAs than patients in groups 2 and 3 (3.2 ± 1.8, 4.6 ± 1.9, and 4.9 ± 2.0 cm

84879990498	Citrobacter peritoneal dialysis peritonitis: Rare occurrence with poor outcomes	Introduction: Non-Pseudomonas gram-negative bacteria are responsible for an increasing proportion of cases of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis. The role of Citrobacter species in the etiology of PD-related peritonitis is often underestimated. In the present study, we aimed to describe the clinical features, laboratory findings, and short and long-term outcomes in PD-related peritonitis caused by Citrobacter. Methods: A retrospective review of all episodes of PD-related peritonitis caused by Citrobacter from a single center between 1990 and 2010 was performed. Clinical features, microbiological data, and outcomes of these episodes were analyzed. Results: Citrobacter species was responsible for 11 PD-related episodes (1.8% of all peritonitis ep-isodes) in 8 patients. Citrobacter freundii was the most common etiologic species (73%), and mixed growth was found in the other 3 episodes (27%). Approximately half (46%) of the episodes were associated with constipation and/or diarrhea. Of the Citrobacter isolates from all episodes, 54% were resistant to cefazolin, and only 18% were susceptible to cefmetazole. All isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime, cefepime, carbapenem, and aminoglycosides. More than half of the patients (54%) were hospitalized for index peritonitis, and 27% of the episodes involved a change in antibiotic medication. One patient had relapsing peritonitis caused by C. koseri (9%). The mortality rate of PD-related peritonitis caused by Citrobacter was 18%, and 89% of surviving patients developed technique failure requiring a modality switch after an average of 12 months of follow-up (range 1.2-31.2 months). Conclusion: PD-related peritonitis caused by Citrobacter is associated with poor outcomes, including high rates of antibiotic resistance, a high mortality rate, and a high rate of technique failure among survivors during the follow-up period. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84883648097	Accumulation of epicardial fat rather than visceral fat is an independent risk factor for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis	Background: Symptoms of heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function are common among patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Epicardial fat (EpF) is an ectopic fat depot with possible paracrine or mechanical effects on myocardial function. The aim of our current study is to assess the association between EpF and Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in patients undergoing PD and to clarify the relationships among EpF, inflammation, and LVDD in this population.Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 149 patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function who were undergoing PD. LVDD was diagnosed (according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines) and EpF thickness measured by echocardiography. The patients without LVDD were used as controls. The serum inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured. The location and amount of adipose tissue were assessed by computed tomography (CT) at the level of the fourth lumbar vertebra.Results: Subjects with LVDD had higher levels of hsCRP, more visceral and peritoneal fat, and thicker EpF (all p < 0.001) than controls. Visceral adipose tissue, hsCRP, and EpF all correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with LVDD. Multivariate regression analysis rendered the relationship between visceral adipose tissue and LVDD insignificant, whereas EpF was the most powerful determinant of LVDD (odds ratio = 2.41, 95% confidence interval = 1.43-4.08, p < 0.01). EpF thickness also correlated significantly with the ratio of transmitral Doppler early filling velocity to tissue Doppler early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e'; r = 0.27, p < 0.01).Conclusion: EpF thickness is significantly independently associated with LVDD in patients undergoing PD and may be involved in its pathogenesis. © 2013 Lin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84885294907	Withdrawal from long-term hemodialysis in patients with end-stage renal disease in taiwan	Withdrawal from dialysis is ethically appropriate for some patients with multiple comorbidities and a shortened life expectancy. Taiwan has the highest prevalence of dialysis patients in the world, and the National Health Insurance (NHI) program offers renal replacement therapy free of charge. In this review, we discuss its current status and many background issues related to withdrawing dialysis from patients with advanced renal failure in Taiwan. Compared with dialysis therapy, the medical resources for hospice care are relatively sparse. Since the announcement of the Statute for Palliative Care in 2000, there has been a gradual improvement in the laws and health polices supporting dialysis withdrawal. Culture and social customs also have a significant impact on the practice of hospice care. Based on current evidence and in accordance with the local environment, we propose recommendations for the clinical practice of dialysis withdrawal and hospice care. There remains a need to expand upon the community-based hospice care and home care systems to better serve patients. In conclusion, there are cross-cultural differences relating to dialysis withdrawal between Taiwan and Western countries. Our experience and clinical recommendations may be helpful for the countries with NHI systems or for the Eastern countries. © 2013.

84893856343	Micrococcus species-related peritonitis in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis	Peritonitis is a major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and remains the most common cause of PD failure. Micrococci are catalase-positive, coagulase-negative, and gram-positive cocci that are spherical, often found in tetrad, and belong to the family Micrococcaceae. Micrococcus species are commonly found in the environment, and it is now recognized that Micrococcus species can be opportunistic pathogens in immunocompromised patients. The only consistent predisposing factor for Micrococcus infection is an immunocompromised state. We report three cases of Micrococcus PD peritonitis. Improper practice of PD may have been the causative factor. Although Micrococcus species are low-virulence pathogens, infection could result in refractory peritonitis and subsequent PD failure. Intraperitoneal administration of vancomycin for at least 2 weeks is recommended for Micrococcus peritonitis. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84895808008	Osteoprotegerin, inflammation and dyslipidemia are associated with abdominal aortic calcification in non-diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis	Background and aims: Abdominal aortic calcification (AC) has been reported to be associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) in hemodialysis patients but is rarely discussed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We examined the independent predictors and predictive power for survival of AC in prevalent PD patients. Methods and Results: AC was detected by computed tomography (CT) and represented as the percentage of the total aortic cross-section area affected by AC (%AC). The predictors of %AC ≥15 were examined by multiple logistic regression analysis. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the hazard ratios associated with high %AC. A total of 183 PD patients were recruited to receive CT scans and divided into group 1 (%AC < 15, n = 97), group 2 (%AC ≥ 15, n = 41), and group 3 (diabetic patients, n = 45). Group 1 patients had lower osteoprotegerin (OPG) levels than group 2 patients (798 ± 378 vs. 1308 ± 1350 pg/mL, p < 0.05). The independent predictors for %AC ≥ 15 included the atherogenic index, OPG, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The age-adjusted hazard ratios associated with %AC ≥15 were 3.46 (p = 0.043) for mortality and 1.90 (p = 0.007) for hospitalization. Conclusions: %AC can predict mortality and morbidity in non-diabetic PD patients, and 15% is a good cut-off value for such predictions. There are complex associations among mineral metabolism, inflammation, and dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of AC. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84903618995	Diagnostic performance of random urine samples using albumin concentration vs ratio of albumin to creatinine for microalbuminuria screening in patients with diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis	IMPORTANCE: A random urine sample measuring the albumin concentration (UAC) without simultaneously measuring the urinary creatinine is less expensive than measuring the ratio of albumin to creatinine (ACR), but comparisons of their diagnostic performance for microalbuminuria screening among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have not been undertaken in previous meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of the UAC vs the ACR in random urine samples for microalbuminuria screening among patients with DM. DATA SOURCES: Electronic literature searches of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Scopus for English-language publications from the earliest available date of indexing through July 31, 2012. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical studies assessing the UAC or the ACR of random urine samples in detecting the presence of microalbuminuria among patients with DM using a urinary albumin excretion rate of 30 to 300mg/d in 24-hour timed urine collections as the criterion standard. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Bivariate random-effects models for analysis and pooling of the diagnostic performance measures across studies, as well as comparisons between different screening tests. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end pointwas the diagnostic performance measures of the UAC or the ACR in random urine samples, as well as comparisons between them. RESULTS: We identified 14 studies, with a total of 2078 patients; 9 studies reported on the UAC, and 12 studies reported on the ACR. Meta-analysis showed pooled sensitivities of 0.85 and 0.87 for the UAC and the ACR, respectively, and pooled specificities of 0.88 and 0.88, respectively. No differences in sensitivity (P = .70), specificity (P = .63), or diagnostic odds ratios (P = .59) between the UAC and the ACR were found. The time point of urine collection did not affect the diagnostic performance of either test. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The UAC and the ACR yielded high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of microalbuminuria. Because the diagnostic performance of the UAC is comparable to that of the ACR, our findings indicate that the UAC of random urine samples may become the screening tool of choice for the population with DM, considering the rising incidence of DM and the constrained health care resources in many countries.

11144348936	Renal hypouricemia is an ominous sign in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome	Background: The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and significance of hypouricemia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS are thought to result from proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients with SARS, but whether cytokines can injure renal tubules is unknown. Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with SARS in Taiwan in April 2003 were studied. Patients were identified as hypouricemic when their serum uric acid (UA) level was less than 2.5 mg/dL (<149 μmol/L) within 15 days after fever onset. Urine UA and creatinine levels were available for 43 patients; the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in 16 patients. Results: Sixteen patients (26.7%) had hypouricemia (UA, 1.68 ± 0.52 mg/dL [100 ± 31 μmol/L]). No differences in age, sex, symptoms, vital signs, hemogram, or other biochemistry data existed between the hypouricemic and normouricemic groups. Fractional excretion (FE) of UA (FE

13444273613	Factors associated with increased plasma homocysteine in patients using an amino acid peritoneal dialysis fluid	Background. Although amino acid peritoneal dialysate (AAPD) substitution is thought to improve protein-energy malnutrition in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), it may also increase plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels due to the methionine load in the dialysate. However, it is still unclear which factors are important for elevating Hcy in patients treated with AAPD. Methods. Sixteen malnourished PD patients (age 48±18 years) were treated daily with one exchange of 1.1% AAPD for 3 months. The effects of AAPD on nutrition, Hey, methionine, leptin and insulin resistance were studied. We also analysed factors that influenced plasma Hcy levels. Results. We found a transient increase in serum albumin (P<0.01) after 1 month treatment, especially in patients with serum albumin ≤ 3.5 g/dl. Total plasma Hcy increased markedly after AAPD (the peak at month 2, P<0.001) and returned to baseline after ceasing AAPD, despite no changes in dietary methionine intake and serum methionine levels. Eight patients with Hcy increments > 5.65 μM (the median) had lesser dietary intakes of protein (P=0.01) and methionine (P=0.028), lower body fat mass (P=0.05) and lower aspartate transaminase (AST) (P=0.008) before AAPD treatment than patients with lower increments. ΔHcy was inversely correlated with baseline dietary methionine intake (r=-0.61), protein intake (r=-0.54) and AST (r=-0.51) (all P<0.05). There was no change in leptin or insulin resistance. AAPD treatment significantly increased Kt/V

84923290104	Serum vitamin D levels are positively associated with varicella zoster immunity in chronic dialysis patients	Uremia results in a relatively immunocompromised status, and patients under chronic dialysis have an elevated risk of developing herpes zoster (HZ). We sought to investigate the relationship between vitamin D status and immunity to varicella-zoster virus (VZV). A multicenter prevalent hemodialysis cohort was assembled between 2012 and 2013. We assayed the biochemical parameters, 25-hydroxy- (25-OH-D) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, vitamin D-binding protein levels in the sera. VZV immunity was quantitated using VZV-specific glycoprotein IgG and IgM titers. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled and their sera were analyzed. Chronic hemodialysis patients with 25-OH-D < 30 ng/ml (insufficiency or deficiency) had significantly lower VZV-IgG than those with sufficient 25-OH-D (p = 0.04). This discrepancy became more prominent if active vitamin D users alone were analyzed (p = 0.01). Generalized additive modeling showed that those with 25-OH-D higher than 27.8 ng/ml or bioavailable 25-OH-D higher than 3.88 ng/ml had significantly higher VZV-IgG levels than those with lower values. Linear regression suggested that both total and bioavailable 25-OH-D were significantly associated with higher VZV-IgG levels (p = 0.003 [total] and 0.01 [bioavailable]), whereas patients with cancer had lower VZV-IgG. Vitamin D may therefore be a potentially useful choice for raising VZV immunity in chronic dialysis patients.
