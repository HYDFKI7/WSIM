29544438032	Examination of varicocele of spermatic veins in Nut-Cracker Syndrome patients using color Doppler ultrasound	Frequency and degree of varicocele of spermatic veins in patients with Nut-Cracker Syndrome (NCS) are evalusted with color Doppler ultrasound. Changes in internal diameter of the spermatic veins of 42 NCS patients were detected using color Doppler sonography in different positions, and compared with the internal diameters and velocities of dilated part (A, Va) and restricted part (B, Vb) of left renal vein (LRV). None of the patients had varicocele of right spermatic veins in supine and standing positions. In supine position, 5% of the patients had clinical varicocele and 12% had sub-clinical varicocele. In standing position, 7% had clinical varicocele and 21% had sub-clinical varicocele. Larger ratios of A/B and Va/Vb in the left renal veins indicate more serious varicocele of left spermatic veins, and varicocele of left spermatic veins may be concomitant with nut-cracker syndrome. The rate of incidence in all NCS cases is 17% in supine position and 28% in standing position, respectively. Color Doppler ultrasound can be used as the first method for detecting varicocele of left spermatic veins in NCS cases.

84877711311	Ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction stimulates cellular endocytosis in facilitation of adeno-associated virus delivery	The generally accepted mechanism for ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) to enhance drug and gene delivery is through sonoporation. However, passive uptake of adeno-associated virus (AAV) into cells following sonoporation does not adequately explain observations of enhanced transduction by UTMD. This study investigated alternative mechanisms of UTMD enhancement in AAV delivery. UTMD significantly enhanced transduction efficiency of AAV in a dose-dependent manner. UTMD stimulated a persistent uptake of AAV into the cytoplasm and nucleus. This phenomenon occurred over several hours, suggesting that some viral particles are endocytosed by cells rather than exclusively passing through pores created by sonoporation. Additionally, UTMD enhanced clathrin expression and accumulation at the plasma membrane suggesting greater clathrin-mediated endocytosis following UTMD. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that UTMD stimulated formation of clathrin-coated pits (CPs) and uncoated pits (nCPs). Furthermore, inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis partially blocked the enhancement of AAV uptake following UTMD. The results of this study implicate endocytosis as a mechanism that contributes to UTMD-enhanced AAV delivery. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84877102217	Observation of encapsulated microbubble dynamics in ultrasound field	Using a long-distance microscope imaging system and a lock-in phase integrate technique, optical measurements demonstrate that the evolutional behaviors of a phospholipid-shelled micro-bubble, a kind of ultrasound contrast agent, under two ultrasound frequencies and different pressures. Dozens of frames of an oscillating microbubble for one acoustic cycle are captured. The experimental data of micro-bubble diameter are fit by the numerical calculations of the Hoff model and the Rayleigh-Plesset model, respectively. The results show the good agreement between experimental data and the theoretical calculation in the Hoff model. In addition, the spectral analysis based on the experimental data indicates that the relative intensity of the second harmonic increases with the driving pressure amplitude. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

70249149259	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction enhances AAV-mediated gene transfection in human RPE cells in vitro and rat retina in vivo	This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US)-targeted microbubble (MB) destruction (UTMD)-mediated rAAV2-CMV-EGFP transfection to cultured human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in vitro and to the rat retina in vivo. In the in vitro study, cultured human RPE cells were exposed to US under different conditions with or without MBs. Furthermore, the effect of UTMD on rAAV2-CMV-EGFP itself and on cells was evaluated. In the in vivo study, gene transfer was examined by injecting rAAV2-CMV-EGFP into the subretinal space of rats with or without MBs and then exposed to US. We investigated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in vivo by stereomicroscopy and performed quantitative analysis using Axiovision 3.1 software. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and frozen sections were used to observe tissue damage and location of the EGFP gene expression. In the in vitro study, the transfection efficiency of rAAV2-CMV-EGFP under optimal UTMD was significantly higher than that of the control group (P=0.000). Furthermore, there was almost no cytotoxicity to the cells and to rAAV2-CMV-EGFP itself. In the in vivo study, UTMD could be used safely to enhance and accelerate the transgene expression of the retina. Fluorescence expression was mainly located in the retinal layer. UTMD is a promising method for gene delivery to the retina.

70349908418	Comparative analysis of gene transfer to human and rat retinal pigment epithelium cell line by a combinatorial use of recombinant adeno - Associated virus and ultrasound OR/AND microbubbles	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction has been utilized to deliver a drug/gene into cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies. This work was performed to investigate the feasibility of gene transfer to human retinal pigment epithelium cell line(ARPE-i9) and rat retinal pigment epithelium cell line(RPE-J) by a combinatorial use of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) and ultrasound (US) or/and mi-crobubbles (MBs) and compare the difference between them. Different doses of serotype 2 rAAV encoding a enhanced green fluorescent protein (1AAV2-EGFP) gene and MBs was administered to ARPE-19 and RPE-J cells under different US conditions. Transfection efficiency and cell viability were assessed by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry (FCM) analysis, trypan blue staining. The results indicated thatUS and MBs could respectively improve rAAWmediated gene transfer to RPE-J cells, but neither US nor MBs could do so in ARPE-L9 cells. US plus MBs could significantly enhance rAAWmediated gene transfer to ARPE-L9 cells, however, the same effects were not seen in RPE-J cells. These findings demonstrated it is not always coincident that US, MBs and US plus MBs exert the similar effects on gene transfer in vitro RPE cells. So, it is necessary to choose appropriate RPE cell line for the study of US or/and MBs-mediated rAAV gene transfer in retinal gene therapy.

This study was performed to investigate the feasibility of UTMD-enhanced recombinant adeno-associated virus- (rAAV) and plasmid-mediated transfection into the human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line ARPE-19. Additionally, the transfection efficiency of rAAV and plasmid was compared in order to choose the appropriate gene vector or strategy to be used with UTMD for RPE-based gene modification. rAAV or plasmid encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein gene was administered to ARPE-19 cells under various UTMD conditions. Cell viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl- tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. UTMD significantly enhanced the transfection efficiency of rAAV and plasmid in ARPE-19 cells without adverse effects on cell viability. The transfection efficiency of rAAV was higher than that of plasmid. rAAV is therefore an appropriate gene vector for use with UTMD in retinal gene modification.

77951957172	Shorter hepatic transit time can suggest coming metastases: Through-monitoring by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography?	Objective. The aim of this study was to assess the value of the hepatic transit time in suggesting coming liver metastases by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS). Methods. Fifty patients with identified liver metastasis (metastasis group [Gmet]), 26 patients without liver metastasis (unclear group [Gunc]) who had proven extrahepatic malignant tumors, and 27 healthy control volunteers (control group [Gcon]) were included in this study. The Gmet group was divided into small and large subgroups. The Gmet group was also divided into pauci and multi subgroups. Every patient was examined by CEUS. The hepatic artery and hepatic vein arrival times were measured, and the difference between them was calculated as the hepatic artery-vein transit time (HAVTT). Patients in Gunc were given a CEUS examination and an enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examination 3 to 4 months later. Results. The HAVTTs in Gmet were significantly shorter than those in Gcon (P < .05), but there were no statistical differences among the subgroups. A normal cutoff point of 8 seconds in the HAVTTs could distinguish Gmet and Gcon with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.40%, 92.59%, and 100%, respectively. As for Gunc, when an HAVTT shorter than 8 seconds was used to predict liver metastasis, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 92.30%, 100%, and 91.67%. Conclusions. The HAVTT may be a useful tool in monitoring liver micrometastases. If a patient with a primary malignant tumor has a shorter HAVTT, it suggests that an extra examination and additional therapy are needed. © 2010 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

77957163116	A immunohistochemical analysis of a rat model of proliferative vitreoretinopathy and a comparison of the expression of TGF-β and PDGF among the induction methods	Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) is a serious complication of retinal detachment surgery or ocular trauma. Our previous study indicated that intravitreal co-injection of retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE)-J cells and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) (not RPE-J cells or PRP alone) in Wistar rat eyes can successfully induce a model of PVR. But which cells are involved in this process and why different induction methods, intravitreal injection of RPE-J cells or/and PRP, induced a different situation remain to be unknown. In this study, immunohistochemistry was performed to identify the main cell types involved in this process. The expression levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA and PDGF-BB were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results showed that RPE cells, glial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages took part in the pathogenesis of this model. The expression levels and durations of TGF-β2 and PDGF-BB partially explained the different results induced by the different induction methods. This provides an experimental proof for attenuation of the experimental PVR by targeting at a specific cells or growth factor.

78649762490	Evaluation of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients with echocardiographic myocardial videodensitometry normalized by displacement	Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. To investigate the feasibility of the myocardial grayscale intensity (GI) normalized by displacement (d) to discriminate between healthy and hypertrophic myocardium in hyper tensive patients, sixty hypertensive patients and sixty age and sex-matched healthy volunteers were involved in this study. The peak d and the maximal GI [GI(max)] and minimal GI [GI(min)] for the middle interventricular septal (IVS) and the middle posterior wall (PW) at the level of papillary muscle were obtained from the standard parasternal long axis views using tissue tracking (TT) and videodensitometric analysis, respectively. The GI and the cyclic variation of GI (CVGI) normalized by d were calculated. The results showed that the d both for IVS and PW, the amplitude of CVGI for IVS in hypertensive patients with LVH were smaller than the ones without LVH and the normal subjects. But, the CVGI/d both for IVS and PW in hypertensive patients with LVH were all greater than the ones without LVH and the normal subjects. Moreover, the parameter, CVGI/d correlated positively with left ventricular mass index (LVMI). So, the method employed in this study videodensitometric analysis in combination with TT allow objective and accurate determination of LVH and CVGI/d is a sensitive indicator for hypertensive patients with LVH. © Association of Basic Medical Sciences of FBIH.

79959726915	Enhanced delivery of monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly l-lysine nanoparticles loading platelet-derived growth factor BB small interfering RNA by ultrasound and/or microbubbles to rat retinal pigment epithelium cells	Background: A novel small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery method based on the combined use of nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrasound (US) and/or microbubbles (MBs) was introduced in the present study. We investigated the efficacy and safety of US and/or MBs-enhanced delivery of monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly l-lysine (mPEG-PLGA-PLL) NPs loading platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) siRNA to rat retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-J cells. Methods: The effect of US and/or MBs on the delivery of NPs containing Cy3-labeled siRNA was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Potential toxicity of NPs and cell viability under different conditions of US and/or MBs were assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Results: The results obtained showed that low intensity US or 15-20% MBs could increase the delivery efficiency of a lower concentration of mPEG-PLGA-PLL NPs loading siRNA to RPE-J cells, whereas the combination of US with MBs under the optimal conditions for the enhancement of NPs delivery did not further increase the cellular uptake of NPs compared to either US or MBs alone (p=0.072 and p=0.488, respectively). Under the optimal condition for US-enhanced NPs delivery, the enhanced PDGF-BB gene silencing with a combination of US and NPs encapsulating siRNA resulted in a significant decrease of mRNA and protein expression levels compared to NPs alone. Conclusions: US and/or MBs could be used safely to enhance the delivery of NPs loading siRNA to rat RPE-J cells. A combination of the chemical (mPEG-PLGA-PLL NPs loading siRNA) and physical (US) approaches could more effectively downregulate the mRNA and protein expression of PDGF-BB. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84856740658	Virtual Touch tissue quantification using acoustic radiation force impulse technology: Initial clinical experience with solid breast masses	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical usage of Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTQ; Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) implementing sonographic acoustic radiation force impulse technology for differentiation between benign and malignant solid breast masses. Methods: A total of 143 solid breast masses were examined with VTQ and their shear wave velocities (SWVs) were measured. From all of the masses, 30 were examined by two independent operators to evaluate the reproducibility of the results of VTQ measurement. All masses were later surgically resected, and the histologic results were correlated with the SWV results. A receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated to assess the diagnostic performance of VTQ. Results: A total of 102 benign lesions and 41 carcinomas were diagnosed on the basis of histologic examination. The VTQ measurements performed by the two independent operators yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.885. Applying a cutoff point of 3.065 m/s, a significant difference (P <.001) was found between the SWVs of the benign (mean ± SD, 2.25 ± 0.59 m/s) and malignant (5.96 ± 2.96 m/s) masses. The sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the differentiation were 75.6%, 95.1%, and 85.6%, respectively. When the repeated non-numeric result X.XX of the SWV measurements was designated as an indicator of malignancy, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 63.4%, 100%, and 89.5%. Conclusions: Virtual Touch tissue quantification can yield reproducible and quantitative diagnostic information on solid breast masses and serve as an effective diagnostic tool for differentiation between benign and malignant solid masses. © 2012 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

Methods: Forty-five patients with solitary thyroid nodule underwent CEUS before operation, and the characteristics of CEUS nodules were analyzed. After surgery, the tumor tissue were stained with CD34 monoclonal antibody, and the number of micro-vessels in the tumor was counted under microscope. Results: There were 23 nodular goiters, 8 adenomas and 14 thyroid carcinomas. Their peak intensity (PI) was (26.82±4.48)dB, (31.50±4.22)dB and (22.36±6.13)dB, respectively, and MVD was 58.55±7.32, 68.67±10.62 and 35.00±6.16 vessels per high power field, respectively. PI positively correlated with MVD (r=0.692, P=0.001). Conclusion: CEUS has certain value in diagnosis of thyroid nodules. PI can reflect MVD of thyroid nodules, therefore can be used to evaluate the angiogenesis of thyroid nodules before operation.

Methods: Thirty-nine patients diagnosed as ITBL were enrolled and divided into 2 groups: ITLB with cholangiectasis (ITBL1, n=17) and without cholangiectasis (ITBL2, n=22) according to whether bile dilatation in liver was showed on two-dimensional ultrasonography or not. Patients with normal liver after transplantation were selected as control group. All the patients underwent CEUS and parameters of CEUS of every group were compared. Then the blood perfusion characters of liver with ITBL after transplantation were analyzed. Results: No statistical difference of peak enhanced intensity was found between group ITBL1 and control group (P>0.05), but the difference of peak slope between group ITBL1 and control group was statistical (P<0.01). Statistical difference of peak enhanced intensity and peak slope was found between group ITBL2 and control group (both P<0.05). Conclusion: The blood perfusion of liver decreases apparently in patients with ITBL after liver transplantation compared with recovered patients after transplantation. This change can be detected with CEUS more sensitively than with conventional ultrasonography. CEUS may be a promising new technique for early diagnosis of ITBL.

84862065730	A novel approach to attenuate proliferative vitreoretinopathy using ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction and recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated RNA interference targeting transforming growth factor-β2 and platelet-derived growth factor-B	Background: To date, with the exception of surgery, there are no satisfactory treatments available for proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) represents a new approach for the gene therapy of eye diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the feasibility of the attenuation of PVR by a combinatorial use of UTMD and recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) targeting transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B. Methods: One hundred and eighty rats of the PVR model were averagely divided into six groups (G). The left eyes, respectively, received an intravitreal injection as follows: normal saline (G1), rAAV2-control small interfering RNA (siRNA) (G2), rAAV2-TGF-β2-siRNA (G3), rAAV2-PDGF-B-siRNA (G4), rAAV2-TGF-β2-siRNA and rAAV2-PDGF-B-siRNA (G5, G6) on day 3 after PVR induction. In G6, a condition of UTMD was used additionally. On days 14 and 28, pathological changes of eye fundus were assessed by ophthalmoscopic and histopathologic examination, and the protein and mRNA levels of TGF-β2 and PDGF-B expression were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: The average grade scales of proliferation and the protein and mRNA expression levels of TGF-β2 and PDGF-B in G6 were all lower than that in G5 on day 28 (p<0.05, unpaired t-test). They were all lower in G5 and G6 than in G1, G2, G3 and G4 on day 28 (p<0.05, one-way analysis of variance), although the protein and mRNA expression levels of PDGF-B in G6 did not differ from that in G1, G2, G3, G4 and G5 on day 14. Conclusions: The combinatorial use of UTMD and rAAV2-mediated RNAi targeting TGF-β2 and PDGF-B can serve as a novel approach to attenuate PVR. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84863017894	Biodegradable nanoparticles of mPEG-PLGA-PLL triblock copolymers as novel non-viral vectors for improving siRNA delivery and gene silencing	Degradation of mRNA by RNA interference is one of the most powerful and specific mechanisms for gene silencing. However, insufficient cellular uptake and poor stability have limited its usefulness. Here, we report efficient delivery of siRNA via the use of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) made from monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)- poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly-l-lysine (mPEG-PLGA-PLL) triblock copolymers. Various physicochemical properties of mPEG-PLGA-PLL NPs, including morphology, size, surface charge, siRNA encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release profile of siRNA from NPs, were characterized by scanning electron microscope, particle size and zeta potential analyzer, and high performance liquid chromatography. The levels of siRNA uptake and targeted gene inhibition were detected in human lung cancer SPC-A1-GFP cells stably expressing green fluorescent protein. Examination of the cultured SPC-A1-GFP cells with fluorescent microscope and flow cytometry showed NPs loading Cy3-labeled siRNA had much higher intracellular siRNA delivery efficiencies than siRNA alone and Lipofectamine-siRNA complexes. The gene silencing efficiency of mPEG-PLGA-PLL NPs was higher than that of commercially available transfecting agent Lipofectamine while showing no cytotoxicity. Thus, the current study demonstrates that biodegradable NPs of mPEG-PLGA-PLL triblock copolymers can be potentially applied as novel non-viral vectors for improving siRNA delivery and gene silencing. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84864193291	Preliminary study on the diagnostic value of acoustic radiation force impulse technology for differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid nodules	Objectives-This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elasticity imaging for differentiating between benign and malignant thyroid lesions. Methods-Hospitalized patients needing thyroid surgery were evaluated. After routine thyroid sonography, the patients underwent ARFI elasticity imaging. Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTI) and Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTQ; Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the elasticity and hardness of nodules. For statistical analysis, the Student t test, analysis of variance, and the X2 test were used to compare the elastic parameters. Results-Of the 98 thyroid nodules observed in 72 hospitalized patients, 56 were nodular goiters, 16 thyroid adenomas, 4 thyroiditis, and 22 thyroid malignancies, with mean VTQ values ± SD of 2.034 ± 0.484, 1.835 ± 0.364, 2.293 ± 0.787, and 3.941 ± 1.393 m/s, respectively. The elastic parameters of malignant nodules were significantly higher than those of benign nodules (P < .001) and the surrounding thyroid parenchyma (P< .001). There was no significant difference between the VTQ value of benign nodules and that of the surrounding normal thyroid parenchyma (P > .05). For differentiating between benign and malignant nodules, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accordance rate were 86.36%, 93.42%, 79.17%, 95.95%, and 91.84% based on the standard VTQ value (2.555m/s). In total, 77.6% (59 of 76) of the benign nodules showed softer and equal images in the VTI mode, and 77.3% (17 of 22) of the malignant nodules showed stiffer images (P < .001). Conclusions- Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging has high sensitivity and specificity in evaluating benign and malignant thyroid nodules and therefore had good diagnostic value in clinical applications. ©2012 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

84864955691	Clinical value and pathological basis of peritumoral hyperenhanced rim of renal cell carcinomas on contrast-enhanced ultrasound	Objective To investigate the clinical value and pathological basis of peritumoral hyperenhanced rim (PHR) of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) on CEUS. Methods CEUS images of 53 patients with 54 renal tumors (27 RCCs, 27 renal angiomyolipomas) were analyzed, and the detection and distribution of PHR were evaluated. HE staining and immunohistochemistry of CD34 were performed in tissue surrounding RCCs (TSR) to observe distribution of psuedocapsule, large vessels, and microvasculars among TSR with different modes of PHR. Results PHR was found only in RCCs. PHR distribution between RCCs and angiomyolipomas was statistically different (P<0.05). Using PHR to diagnose RCC, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false positive and false negative was 44.44% (12/27), 100% (27/27), 100% (12/12), 64.29% (27/42), 0 (0/27) and 35.71% (15/42), respectively. Pseudocapsule distribution between RCCs with PHR and RCCs without PHR was not statistically different (P>0.05). There were rich large blood vessels in TSR with PHR in washin and both phases, and few or thimbleful large vessels were found in TSR without PHR in washout phase. Cancer tissue near the boundary (CTNB) of TSR had the highest microvessel density (MVD). MVD differences in different TSR with PHR were statistically different between washin and washout phases, washin and both phases, both phases with PHR and without PHR (P<0.05), but no statistical difference was found between washout and both phases (P>0.05). Conclusion PHR is a highly specific complementary indicator in diagnosing RCC, and it is correlated with rich blood vessels in TSR and (or) a higher MVD value in CTNB.

84870510951	Ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction-mediated gene delivery system: Application to therapy for ocular disease	Background: Ocular disorders have greatest potential for benefit from gene therapy. The major obstacle in the clinical application of gene therapy is not due to the lack of an ideal gene, but rather the lack of a clinically safe and efficient gene transfer method. Ultrasound (US) targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD)-mediated gene delivery system as a noninvasive gene transfer method is now widely used in gene therapy of cardiovascular disease, muscular tissue, and tumor, and proved to effectively enhance gene transfer in various studies in vitro and in vivo. However, it is just the beginning of application for ophthalmological disease. Objective: Review the latest advancements in UTMD-mediated ocular gene transfection and discuss mechanisms of UTMD involved in gene transfection, obstacles, and limitations to the use of this technology, as well as the perspectives for future applications of UTMD-mediated gene delivery system. Methods: Summarize published literature concerning UTMD-mediated ocular gene transfection. Results: UTMD is an effective and safe gene delivery method of therapy for ocular diseases. Considerable progress has been made in US or UTMD-mediated viral and nonviral ocular gene delivery to retina, like recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) and nanoparticles as nonviral gene carriers. In addition, UTMD has potential for producing the blood-retinal barrier opening and serves as a promising method for intravenous ocular gene delivery. Conclusion: UTMD-mediated gene delivery system could effectively enhance gene transfer into ocular tissue. Though several problems remain to be solved, UTMD is a promising technology for the targeted gene therapy of ocular disease.

84873109027	Targeted delivery of biodegradable nanoparticles with ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction-mediated hVEGF-siRNA transfection in human PC-3 cells in vitro	A potentially viable approach for treating late-stage prostate cancer is gene therapy. Successful gene therapy requires safe and efficient delivery systems. In this study, we report the efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) via the use of biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) made from monomethoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly-l-lysine (mPEG-PLGA-PLL) triblock copolymers. On the basis of previous findings, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (cRGD) peptides were conjugated to NPs to recognize the target site, integrin αvβ3, expressed in high levels in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The suppression of angiogenesis by the downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression has been widely used to inhibit the growth of malignant tumors. In our study, human VEGF (hVEGF)-siRNA was encapsulated in NPs to inhibit VEGF expression in PC-3 cells. Concurrently, sonoporation induced by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) was utilized for the delivery of siRNA-loaded NPs. Our results showed low cytotoxicity and high gene transfection efficiency, demonstrating that the targeted delivery of biodegradable NPs with UTMD may be potentially applied as new vector system for gene delivery.

84874594560	Renal oncocytoma: Contrast-enhanced sonographic features	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to illustrate the features of renal oncocytoma on contrast-enhanced sonography. Methods: Five cases of surgical pathologically proven renal oncocytoma were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed in this study. The 5 patients studied included 3 men and 2 women with a mean age of 52.3 years (range, 32-66 years). All patients underwent conventional and contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations before surgery. The sonographic features, enhancement pattern, and dynamic perfusion change of the tumors and renal parenchyma in vascular phases were evaluated and compared to computed tomography. Results: On grayscale sonography, renal oncocytomas appeared as solitary hypoechoic or isoechoic masses originating from the renal cortex measuring 2 to 6 cm with a welldefined margin. Color Doppler flow imaging showed rich blood flow signals in the periphery and striplike blood flow signals within the masses. On contrast-enhanced sonography, the features of these tumors included early enhancement, hyperenhancement, and fast wash-out compared to the adjacent renal cortex. There were irregular nonenhanced areas seen in the center of the masses (n = 3) and nonenhanced thin rims seen in the periphery (n = 5). Macroscopically, the well-marginated tumors were yellowish brown with a tender texture and were located in the renal cortex. Central irregularly shaped fibrous scars were seen in 3 tumors, consistent with nonenhanced areas on contrast-enhanced imaging. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced sonography can provide valuable hemodynamic information on renal oncocytoma, which may help in making a differential diagnosis of this benign renal tumor in clinical practice. © 2013 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

84876542312	Evaluation of cervical cancer detection with acoustic radiation force impulse ultrasound imaging	The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) ultrasound imaging and its potential value in the characterization of cervical cancer. ARFI ultrasound imaging of the uterine cervix was performed in 58 patients with cervical cancer prior to surgery. The diagnosis of cervical cancer was confirmed by pathological results in each case. eSie Touch elastography imaging (EI), Virtual Touch tissue imaging (VTI) and Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTQ; Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA, USA) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the elasticity and hardness of lesions. For statistical analysis, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and the Student's u test were used to compare the elastic parameters and the results. EI showed that, compared with the surrounding cervical tissue, 72.41% (42 of 58) of the malignant lesions showed 4th or 5th grade images and 27.59% (16 of 58) had 3rd grade images. The EI images showed a significant difference between the malignant lesions and the surrounding normal tissues (P<0.001). VTI showed that compared with the surrounding cervical tissue, 84.48% (49 of 58) of the malignant lesions were stiffer than the surrounding tissues and 15.52% (9 of 58) had black and white honeycomb-like images. The VTI images showed a significant difference between the malignant lesions and normal cervical tissues (P<0.001). The surrounding normal tissues had lower VTQ values, with a mean of 2.11±1.19 m/sec, while the VTQ values in malignant lesions were higher than the surrounding normal tissues (3.41±1.59 m/sec, P<0.001). ARFI ultrasound imaging of the uterine cervix may be an objective method for the assessment of soft tissues. It has high sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of cervical cancer and therefore has good diagnostic value in clinical applications.

84879911385	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction enhances gene transduction of adeno-associated virus in a less-permissive cell type, NIH/3T3	Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a common vector utilized in gene therapy. The NIH/3T3 cell line, which is a potential induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell type, was identified to be a less-permissive cell type to AAV due to its defective endosomal processing. Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) enhanced the gene transduction of AAV in permissive cells. However, there are no data concerning UTMD enhancement in less-permissive cells, and the exact mechanism of UTMD enhancement in cellular uptake is unclear. Greater knowledge concerning the rate-limiting steps in NIH/3T3 cells would aid in the elucidation of the mechanism of UTMD enhancement in the gene transduction of AAV. In the present study, UTMD enhanced the gene transduction of AAV in NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting that UTMD-enhanced AAV-mediated gene transduction may be beneficial for gene therapy in iPS cells. The dose dependence of UTMD enhancement indicated that mechanisms other than sonoporation were involved in the cellular uptake of AAV. However, UTMD did not greatly increase the gene transduction of AAV in NIH/3T3 cells. Additionally, the similar degree of enhancement in the two cell types resulted in no correlation between UTMD and endosomal processing. Future studies on UTMD-mediated AAV transduction in other non- or less-permissive cell types may aid in elucidating the exact mechanism of UTMD enhancement in cellular uptake.

Methods: Balloon injury was performed in aorta to induce neointima formation in 48 rabbits. The rabbit models were randomly divided into 6 groups (each n=8) 3 days after operation: Group A, control group; group B, ultrasound+microbubble; group C, rapamycin; group D, ultrasound+rapamycin; group E, UTMD+high dose rapamycin; group F, UTMD+low dose rapamycin. Ultrasonography was performed to detect the intima-media thickness (IMT) before the surgery and on the 28th day after the surgery. On the 28th day after surgery, the aortas were taken to detect the intima thickness/media thickness (I/M), and the expression of p27 and VEGF were detected using pathological means. Results: On the 28th day, ultrasonography showed that the IMT was higher in group A, B, C and D than that in group E and F (all P<0.01). Filling defect was observed in group A, B, C and D. Pathological results displayed that I/M was lower in group E and F. The level of p27 expression in group E and F were higher than that of group A, B, C and D (all P<0.01). The level of VEGF expression in group E and F were lower than that of group A, B, C and D (all P<0.01). Conclusion: UTMD mediated rapamycin therapy can inhibit the neointima formation in rabbits aorta after balloon injury. Copyright © 2013 by the Press of Chinese Journal of Medical Imaging Technology.

84879639323	Enhancing HSP70-ShRNA transfection in 22RV1 prostate cancer cells by combination of sonoporation, liposomes and HTERT/CMV chimeric promoter	Gene therapy is a potentially viable approach for treating hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC), it requires efficient delivery systems and a target gene. Inducing carcinoma cell apoptosis by inhibition of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) overexpression has been emerging as an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. In our study, the high tumor-specificity of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (HTERT) expression prompted the use of an HTERT/cytomegalovirus (CMV) chimeric promoter to drive HSP70-ShRNA expression to induce HRPC 22RV1 cell apoptosis. At the same time, sonoporation induced by ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) was utilized for delivery of plasmid loaded with HTERT/CMV promoter. Our results indicated the combination of sonoporation, low-dose liposomes and HTERT/CMV chimeric promoter as a delivery system has the potential to promote efficient gene transfer with lower cytotoxicity.

84893564835	Combined value of Virtual Touch tissue quantification and conventional sonographic features for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm	Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the value of sonographic features including Virtual Touch tissue quantification (VTQ; Siemens Medical Solutions, Mountain View, CA) for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm. Methods: Seventy-one thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm with pathologic diagnoses were included in this study. The conventional sonographic features and quantitative elasticity features (VTQ) were observed and compared between benign and malignant nodules. Results: There were 39 benign and 32 malignant nodules according to histopathologic examination. When compared with benign nodules, malignant nodules were more frequently taller than wide, poorly defined, and markedly hypoechoic (P <.05). Color Doppler sonographic features were not significantly different between benign and malignant nodules. The VTQ value for malignant nodules (mean ± SD 3.260 ± 0.725 m/s) was significantly higher than that of benign ones (2.108 ± 0.455 m/s; P <.001). The cutoff point for the differential diagnosis was 2.910 m/s, with sensitivity, specificity, a positive predictive value, a negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of 71.9%, 100%, 100%, 81.2%, and 87.3% respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that a taller-than-wide shape, a poorly defined boundary, marked hypoechogenicity, and a VTQ value greater than 2.910 m/s were independent risk factors for malignancy, with odds ratios of 69.366, 41.864, 5.945, and 64.991. The combination of VTQ with a tallerthan-wide shape had the highest sensitivity and specificity of 90.6% and 97.4%. Conclusions: The shape, margin, echogenicity, and VTQ value are useful sonographic criteria for differentiating benign and malignant thyroid nodules smaller than 10 mm. When VTQ was combined with B-mode sonographic features, the sensitivity was improved significantly.

84893715841	SiRNA delivery mediated by copolymer nanoparticles, phospholipid stabilized sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles and ultrasound	The combination of ultrasound (US) and microbubbles (MB) is a promising physical method for improving the nanoparticles (NPs) delivery efficiency. However, few concerns over comparable delivery effect of the passive or active targeting property's NPs mediated by US and MB have limited their translation towards further application. For this, we prepared small interfering RNA (siRNA)-loaded mPEG-PLGA-PLL (siRNA/mPPP) NPs with passive targeting property and siRNAloaded mPEG-PLGA-PLL-cRGD (siRNA/mPPPR) NPs with active targeting property, and evaluated the effect of US and MB for their delivery efficiency. The experimental results demonstrated that US and MB effectively enhance the siRNA delivery efficiency of the mPPP NPs compared with the mPPP NPs alone. In contrast, an improved delivery efficiency of siRNA was not observed in PC-3 cells treated with the mPPPR NPs mediated by US and MB, suggesting that the delivery efficiency of NPs mediated US and MB also depend on its targeting properties.

84894467338	The dual effect of ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction in mediating recombinant adeno-associated virus delivery in renal cell carcinoma: Transfection enhancement and tumor inhibition	Background: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is recognized as a promising vector for cancer gene therapy, although its low transfer efficiency in less permissive cells limits extensive application. Our previous studies reported that ultrasound-targeted microbubble (MB) destruction (UTMD) enhanced rAAV transfer in its permissive retinal cells. In the present study, we investigated whether UTMD increased rAAV transfer in less permissive human renal cell carcinoma (hRCC) cells and tumors. Methods: hRCC cells were treated with rAAV2 under different conditions of UTMD, and the viral transfer efficiency and cell viability were analyzed. Fifty-two male nude mice (BALB/c) implanted with hRCC cells were randomly assigned to four groups consisting of rAAV, rAAV+ultrasound and rAAV+UTMD (20μl and 40μl of MBs). UTMD was initiated immediately after intratumoral viral injection, and viral transfer efficiency and tumor volumes were analyzed at 12weeks after infection. Results: The efficiency of non-augmented transfer of rAAV2 into hRCC cells was low (17.28±2.44%). The use of UTMD enhanced viral transfer efficiency by two- to three-fold, and enhanced viral genomic DNA by more than nine-fold, without decreasing cell viability. In vivo studies also showed that UTMD increased rAAV2 transfer in tumor. The enhancements were maintained for a period of 12weeks. Tumor growth in mice was inhibited by UTMD treatment, and UTMD treatment augmented by MBs (40μl) produced an even stronger effect. Conclusions: UTMD enhanced rAAV2 transfer into less permissive RCC cells and tumors, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth, which suggests that UTMD may be a useful delivery tool for cancer gene therapy. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84896831355	Ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction for novel dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 in prostate cancer	The aim was to determine whether ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) promotes dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 for therapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), to improve the specific and efficient delivery of siRNA, to induce tumor cell specifific apoptosis, and to find new therapeutic targets specific of CRPC.VCaP cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides. HSP70, HSP90 and cleaved caspase-3 expression were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Apoptosis and transfection efficiency were assessed by flow cytometry. Cell viability assays were used to evaluate safety. We found HSP72, HSC70 and HSP90 expression to be absent or weak in normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), but uniformly strong in prostate cancerous cells (VCaP). UTMD combined with dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 siRNA improve the efficiency of transfection, cell uptake of siRNA, downregulation of HSP70 and HSP90 expression in VCaP cells at the mRNA and protein level, and induction of extensive tumor-specifific apoptosis. Cell counting kit-8 assays showed decreased cellular viability in the HSP72/HSC70-siRNA silenced group. These results suggest that the combination of UTMD with dual targeting HSP70 therapy for PCa may be most efficacious, providng a novel, reliable, non-invasive, safe targeted approach to improve the specific and efficient delivery of siRNA, and achieve maximal effects.

84897471895	Sonoporation-induced depolarization of plasma membrane potential: Analysis of heterogeneous impact	Disrupting plasma membrane integrity would inevitably promote anomalous ion fluxes across the membrane and thereby upset the trans-membranous potential. In this article, we report new findings on how sonoporation as a physical membrane perforation strategy would lead to different forms of plasma membrane potential disruption. Our investigation was conducted with a customized fluorescence imaging platform that enabled live monitoring of plasma membrane potential in relation to individual sonoporation events triggered on HeLa cervical cancer cells. Sonovue microbubbles were used as sonoporation agents (added at a 4:3 cell-to-bubble ratio), and they were activated by 1-MHz pulsed ultrasound with 0.35-MPa peak negative pressure, 20-cycle pulse duration, 20-Hz pulse repetition frequency and 1-s total exposure duration. Results indicate that the plasma membrane potential response was heterogeneous among sonoporated cells: (i) membrane potential of irreversibly sonoporated cells was permanently depolarized; (ii) reversibly sonoporated cells exhibited either transient or sustained membrane depolarization; (iii) intact cells adjacent to sonoporated ones underwent transitory membrane depolarization. These findings effectively serve to substantiate the causal relationship between sonoporation and plasma membrane potential. © 2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84902588671	Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction combined with dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 inhibits HSP90 function and induces extensive tumor-specific apoptosis	The specific and efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into cancer cells in vivo remains a major obstacle. In this study, we investigated whether ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) combined with dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 in prostate cancer cell lines improve the specific and efficient cell uptake of siRNA, inhibit HSP90 function and induce extensive tumor-specific apoptosis. VCaP cells were transfected with siRNA oligo-nucleotides. Cell viability assays were used to evaluate the safety of UTMD. The expression of HSP70, HSP90, caspase-8, caspase-3, PARP-1 and cleaved caspase-3 were determined by quantitative PCR and western blotting. Apoptosis and transfection efficiency were detected by flow cytometry. We found that HSP72, HSC70 and HSP90 expression was absent or weak in normal prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), and became uniformly and strongly expressed in prostate cancer cells (VCaP). VCaP and RWPE-1 cells expressed very low levels of caspase-8, caspase-3, PARP-1 and cleaved caspase-3. UTMD combined with dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 siRNA impoved the efficiency of transfection, cell uptake of siRNA, downregulated HSP70 and HSP90 expression in VCaP cells on the mRNA and protein levels, and upregulated major apoptotic markers (PARP-1, caspase-8, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3), thus, inducing extensive tumor-specific apoptosis. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed decreased cellular viability in the HSP72/HSC70-siRNA silenced group. These results suggest that the combination of UTMD with dual targeting of HSP72 and HSC70 may improve the specific and efficient cell uptake of siRNA, inhibit HSP90 function and induce extensive tumor-specific apoptosis, indicating a novel, potential means for targeting therapeutic strategy to prostate cancer cells.

84902003700	Quantification of enhancement of renal parenchymal masses with contrast-enhanced ultrasound	The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of quantitative assessment of enhancement in diagnosing renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). A total of 73 solid renal parenchymal masses underwent both conventional ultrasound and CEUS. We compared the difference in maximum diameters on conventional ultrasound and CEUS between the benign and malignant groups. Enhancement features derived from a time-intensity curve were also analyzed. The diameters of renal cancer were found to be larger on CEUS than on conventional ultrasound (p<0.05). When cutoff values of 4.74s for washout time and 8.52% for enhancement intensity at 60s for diagnosing RCCs were applied, the sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 67.3%, 95.2%, 86.5% and 65.4%, 81.0%, 68.4%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity for these two enhancement characteristics combined as a criterion for differentiating RCCs from benign lesions were 44.0% and 99.1%, respectively. Early washout in the area of maximal intensity in the interior of the lesion and prolonged washout in the whole area of the lesion are specific CEUS manifestations suggestive of RCC. © 2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.
