0030754533	Congenital factor VII deficiency presenting as delayed bleeding following dental extraction. A review of the role of factor VII in coagulation	Recent updated models of the coagulation mechanism suggest that factor VII/thromboplastin complex is the main initiator or trigger of coagulation. Factor VII activation of factor IX is likely to be an important activation pathway. Inhibition of factor VII by tissue factor pathway inhibitor may have a regulatory role in the initiation of coagulation. Defining factor VII's interactions in coagulation physiology may lead to answers for some clinical problems in both hemostasis and thrombosis. We describe a 15-year-old Chinese boy with factor VII deficiency and a factor VII level of 0.08 U/ml. His symptoms were recurrent epistaxis and moderate delayed bleeding post-dental extraction. Such specific symptoms have been reported previously in a study of 40 European patients. It is one diagnosis to consider if a patients main symptom is significant post-dental bleeding. It is possible that there is requirement for higher levels of factor VII at these anatomical sites making them the common sites for symptoms in patients with moderate deficiency. Case reports of rare clotting factor deficiencies will illustrate what may be important in vitro functions of clotting proteins. Therefore reporting should be encouraged, especially during review and reconsideration of models of the coagulation mechanism.

25144447797	Histologic and ultrastructural study on statin graft in rabbit skulls	Purpose: To study the early healing pattern of statin-induced osteogenesis, we examined the early histologic and ultrastructural pictures of bone defect healing with and without statin. Materials and Methods: Twenty-eight bone defects were created in the parietal bone of 14 New Zealand White rabbits. In the Statin Group of 7 rabbits, the defects were grafted with collagen matrix carriers mixed with statin solution. In the Collagen Matrix Group of 7 rabbits, the defects were grafted with collagen matrix carriers mixed with water for injection. The Statin Group and the Collagen Matrix Group were killed on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 14 after surgery. Bone defects with surrounding tissues were prepared for histologic assessment. Bone defects of day 14 were also prepared for ultrastructural assessment. Results: New bone was formed on day 5 in the defects grafted with statin. No cartilage intermediate stage was detected. This occurred 1 day earlier than for those grafted with the carrier alone. The bone defects of day 14 showed that an abundance of bone was formed in the Statin Group and osteocytes were identified ultrastructurally. Conclusions: This study supported statin-induced and accelerated bone formation locally. © 2005 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

28744452058	Effect of naringin collagen graft on bone formation	Naringin is a flavonoid available commonly in citrus fruits and is also a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Our laboratory compared the amount of new bone produced by naringin in collagen matrix to that produced by bone grafts and collagen matrix. Twenty bone defects, 5 mm×10 mm were created in the parietal bone of 14 New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, 5 defects were grafted with naringin solution mixed with collagen matrix, 5 defects were grafted with autogenous endochondral bone. In the control groups, 5 defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (active control) and 5 were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across each defect. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 150 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 284% and 490% more new bone was present in defects grafted with naringin in collagen matrix than those grafted with bone and collagen, respectively. No bone was formed in the passive control group. In conclusion, naringin in collagen matrix have the effect of increasing new bone formation locally and can be used as a bone graft material. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

32844455272	Factors regulating condylar cartilage growth under repeated load application	Mechanical loading can influence the biological behavior of the bone-associated cells leading to adaptive changes in skeletal mass and architecture. SOX9 and PTHrP genes are known to regulate chondrocyte differentiation and delay maturation, ultimately control the endochondral bone formation. To investigate the effects of repeated mechanical loading on bone, 280 Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this experiment. The animals were randomly allocated into experimental and control groups. Repeated mechanical loading was applied through a bite-jumping device in the experimental group. The experimental animals were sacrificed on 10 different time points together with the matched control. Total RNA was extracted from the mandibular condylar cartilage for PTHrP and SOX9 genes quantification using real-time RT-PCR. Results showed that PTHrP expression was increased and reached a peak level on the seventh day after mechanical loading was given. Repeated mechanical loading triggered a significant increase of PTHrP expression leading to another peak increment. The expression of SOX9 was highly correlated with the PTHrP expression, and its pattern of expression was similar to that of PTHrP after repeated mechanical loading. In conclusions, repeated mechanical loading on the condyle triggers the expression of PTHrP and SOX9, which in turn promotes condylar cartilage growth.

32844460618	Expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase during early stages of bone graft healing	The aim of this study was to investigate the temporal expression of TIMP-1 within endochondral and intramembranous bone grafts during the early stages of healing in thirty six adult New Zealand white rabbits. Total RNA was isolated from bone grafts extracted on days 0-11 and day 14 post-grafting, for RT-PCR analysis. In situ hybridization was carried out on days 1-9 and day 14. Results showed TIMP-1 expression coincides with osteogenesis, which indicates a role for TIMP in preserving the newly formed bone during the initial stages of graft healing. Bone grafts play an important role in influencing the healing process mediated by the host tissues. The temporal expression of TIMP-1 differs in endochondral and intramembranous bone grafts. The earlier expression of TIMP-1 by endochondral bone grafts, could be the reason for the delayed vascularization while the expression of TIMP-1 by the intramembranous bone grafts, at a later stage could allow for earlier vascularization.

33645945867	Systemic effect of crude extract from rhizome of Drynaria fortunei on bone formation in mice	The structure of the bones of mice with and without consumption of Gusuibu extracts were compared. Twenty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into two groups. In the control group ten mice were daily fed a normal diet and distilled water for drinking. In the Gusuibu group ten mice were daily fed a normal diet and distilled water mixed with Gusuibu extract for drinking. The mice were kept for 5 weeks and were then killed. Using micro-computed tomography, 20 micro-tomographic slices with an increment of 0.25 mm were acquired to cover the proximal end of the left tibia of each mouse. Quantitative morphometry of the bone structure was performed. The results showed that consumption of Gusuibu extract increased the bone volume/tissue volume ratio by 6.45%. The bone trabeculae were increased by 10.00% in number so that the bone density was increased. To conclude, Gusuibu extract taken orally increased bone density.

33745999770	Tanaka-Johnston mixed dentition analysis for southern Chinese in Hong Kong	Objective: To compare the prediction of unerupted permanent canine and premolar size of a comparable sample size of southern Chinese population with that of the study of Tanaka and Johnston. Materials and Methods: Teeth on study casts of an unselected sample from a 12-year-old Hong Kong Oral Health Survey of 12-year-old children (n = 459; 295 males and 164 females) were measured in the mesiodistal dimension. A Chinese mixed dentition analysis based on the Tanaka and Johnston method was constructed with linear regression equations for prediction of the mesiodistal widths of unerupted canines and premolars. Results: Sexual dimorphism was evident between southern Chinese males and females in incisors, canines, and premolars in the mesiodistal dimension. Conclusions: To predict the space (in mm) required for alignment of unerupted canine and premolars in southern Chinese children, halve the sum of the mesiodistal dimensions of the four mandibular incisors and add the respective constants for males (upper, 11.5; lower, 10.5) or females (upper, 11.0; lower, 10.0). © 2006 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

33750603593	Dentofacial characteristics of Chinese obstructive sleep apnea patients in relation to obesity and severity	Objective: To evaluate dentofacial characteristics in relation to obesity and degree of severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in male Chinese patients and to elucidate the relationship between demographic parameters (age, body weight, height, and body mass index [BMI]) cephalometric parameters and OSA in these subjects. Materials and Methods: Lateral cephalograms of 121 Chinese male patients in natural head posture were obtained. Based on BMI value, the patients were divided into three groups. Based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) value, the patients were divided into a mild-to-moderate and a severe group. Results: The hyoid position and soft palate length were significantly different among the three obesity groups. Soft palate length was significantly longer (P < .01) in the severe OSA group than in the mild-to-moderate OSA group. Tongue base was significantly more inferiorly placed (P < .05) in the severe OSA group than in the mild-to-moderate OSA group. Craniocervical extension was significantly increased (P < .05) in the severe OSA group. Statistically significant differences were found among the three obesity groups in mandibular length, mandibular body length, maxillary length, anterior cranial base length, and overbite. The multiple stepwise linear regression analysis identified body weight, lower posterior facial height, mandibular body length, craniocervical extension, and sella-hyoid distance as the significant predictive variables for AHI. Conclusions: This study revealed the existence of craniofacial and upper airway soft tissue differences in relation to obesity and severity of OSA among male Chinese OSA patients. Body weight and certain cephalometric parameters were significant predictors of OSA in Chinese male subjects. © 2006 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

33750872026	Effect of naringin on bone cells	Statin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was shown to increase BMIP-2 gene expression for bone formation, by blocking the mevalonate pathway in cholesterol production. We investigated the effect of naringin, a flavonoid available commonly in citrus fruits, which was also a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in UMR 106 osteoblastic cell line in vitro. The control group consisted of cells cultured without any intervention for different time intervals (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), whereas the experimental (naringin) group consisted of cells cultured with naringin of different concentrations (0.001 μmol/L, 0.01 μmol/L, and 0.1 μmol/L) for the same time intervals of the control. Colorimetric Tetrazolium. (MTT) assay, total protein content assay, and alkaline phosphatase activity were used to measure the cellular activities. Results for the naringin group showed an increase in MTT assay compared with the control and the effect was dose dependent. At high concentration (0. 1 μmol), the increases ranged from 60% to 80%. In the total protein content assay, naringin also showed an increase compared with control and the effect was also dose dependent. At high concentration (0.1 μmol), the increases ranged from 9% to 20%. In the alkaline phosphatase activity assay, naringin at high concentration (0.1 μmol) significantly increased the activity up to 20%. In conclusion, naringin significantly increased bone cell activities in vitro. This is the first study specifically attempted to investigate the effect of naringin on bone cell activities. Besides statin, this provided another example of mevalonate pathway blockage in the cholesterol production pathway by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition will increase the bone cell activities. © 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

33847108446	Tooth dimensions of Southern Chinese	Teeth in casts of a random sample from the Hong Kong Oral Health Survey of 12-year-old children (n=459; 295 boys and 164 girls) were measured in the mesiodistal, buccolingual, and clinical crown height dimensions. Sexual dimorphism was evident in all tooth types in nearly all tooth dimensions, with the exception of the mesiodistal dimension of mandibular central incisors. The Chinese male tooth dimensions were larger than in females in nearly all characters. The measurements were compared with other human groups. Results showed that the Southern Chinese had larger tooth dimensions than the Japanese and than the White Americans. Hence it is important to have data concerning a relevant human group for purposes of clinical diagnosis and planning of treatment. These data may also be useful in forensic dentistry. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

34547697916	Effect of puerarin on bone formation	Objective: Puerarin is one of the major phytoestrogens isolated from Pueraria lobata, a Chinese medicine known as Gegen. Our laboratory compared the amount of new bone produced by puerarin in collagen matrix (carrier) to that produced by the collagen matrix alone. Method: Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 10 mm were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, six defects were grafted with puerarin solution mixed with collagen matrix. In the control groups, six defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (active control) and six were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across each defect. No new bone was formed in the passive control group. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 100 sections (10 sections in each defect, in five defects randomly selected in each of the experimental group and active control group) using image analysis. Results: A total of 554% more new bone was present in defects grafted with puerarin in collagen matrix than those grafted with the collagen matrix alone. Conclusion: Puerarin in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally and can be used for bone grafting or for bone induction often required in surgery. © 2007 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

0033109835	A quantitative assessment of the healing of intramembranous and endochondral autogenous bone grafts	The aim of the study was to assess quantitatively the amount of new bone formed in the early stages of healing of intramembranous and endochondral autogenous bone grafts so as to gain further insight into their integration with host bone. Eighteen critical size defects were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group (five rabbits), each rabbit was grafted with intramembranous bone in one defect and with endochondral bone in the other. In the control group (four rabbits), one defect was left empty (passive control) and the other was grafted with rabbit skin collagen (active control). After 14 days, the rabbits were killed and the defects were prepared for histological analysis. Serial sections were made across the whole defect. Each defect was divided into five regions spaced 1500 μm apart. Two sections were randomly drawn from each region. Quantitative analysis was performed on 100 sections using an image analyser computer software system to assess the amount of new bone formed in each defect. No bone was detected across the defect in either the active or passive controls. One-hundred-and-sixty-six per cent more new bone was formed in defects grafted with intramembranous bone than those grafted with endochondral bone. This represented an extremely significant difference (P < 0.0001, unpaired t-test) between the two groups. The results show that intramembranous autogenous bone produced more bone than the endochondral bone when grafted in the skull. Clinically, it is recommended that intramembranous bone is used to replace lost membranous bone in the oral cavity, as well as in skull defects, whenever possible.

Thirty-five bone defects were created in the parietal bone of 20 New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental groups, 5 defects were grafted with endochondral bone, 5 with endochondral bone mixed with DBM(IM)) (EC-DBM(IM)), 5 with intramembranous bone mixed with DBM(IM) (IM-DBM(IM)) and 6 with endochondral bone mixed with DBM(EC) (EC-DBM(EC)). In the control groups, 10 defects were left alone (passive control) and 4 were grafted with rabbit skin collagen (active control). They were all killed on day 14 and the defects were prepared for histological study. Serial sections were cut across the whole defect. Quantitative analyses were made on 202 sections of the experimental groups by image analysis. A total of 414%, 708%, and 85% more new bone was formed in defects grafted with composite EC-DBM(IM), IM-DBM(IM) and EC-DBM(EC), respectively, than those grafted with endochondral bone alone (P<0.001). No bone was formed in either passive or active controls. In conclusion, demineralized bone matrices, particularly those derived from intramembranous bone, have extremely high osteoinductive properties and greatly improve the integration of autogenous bone grafts in the skull.

38749151250	Orthodontic treatment of anterior open bite	Objective. To review the currently available treatment options of anterior open bite. Methods. Search all major dental journals and literature on treatment and management of anterior open bite. Medline search (1960-2006). Literature and data on treatment and management of anterior open bite with keywords 'open bite', 'anterior open bite', 'orthodontic treatment', 'long face', 'vertical dentoalveolar problem' and 'vertical skeletal problem'. Results. Over 50 articles were found and relevant information and data were reviewed by the authors. It was found that the multifactorial nature of anterior open bite makes its management difficult and various treatment modalities are being used. Clinicians must be able to diagnose the problem and choose the best treatment. Conclusion. Successful treatment of anterior open bite greatly relies on both diagnosis and therapeutics. Although there are many different treatment modalities available, stability after treatment is still a critical issue as evidence on long term stability of various treatment options is lacking. Thus, clinicians should pay more attention during retention phase and long-term studies on post-treatment changes and stability should be encouraged. © 2007 BSPD, IAPD and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

38349042337	Temporal expression of SOX9 and type II collagen in spheno-occipital synchondrosis of mice after mechanical tension Stimuli	Objective: To associate the expressions of SOX9 and type II collagen during growth in the synchondrosis with and without tensile stress in order to understand the role of these factors in the growth of cartilage in spheno-occipital synchondrosis. Materials and Methods: Sixty 1-day-old male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Each group was subdivided again into five different time points which were 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours. Each subgroup consisted of five mice. Each mouse was sacrificed using an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium. The synchondroses were aseptically removed and incubated in a 24-well plate with or without tensile stress in tissue culture. Tissue sections were stained immunohistochemically to quantitatively analyze the expression of SOX9 and type II collagen. Results: There was a statistically significant increase of 57% (P < .001) in the expression of SOX9 between the experimental and control groups at 24 hours, followed by a significant increase of 44.4% (P < .001) in the expression of type II collagen at 72 hours. Conclusions: SOX9 may play an important role for early differentiation of chondrocytes and increase the expression of type II collagen, a major component of the extracellular matrix, during the growth of cartilage in the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. © 2007 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

38349142827	The effects of rhizoma curculiginis and rhizoma drynariae extracts on bones	Background: Rhizoma Curculiginis (Xianmao) and Rhizoma Drynariae (Gusuibu) are 'Yang-tonifying' traditional Chinese herbal medicines used to strengthen bones. This investigation aims to assess the systemic effect of extracts of Rhizoma Curculiginis and Rhizoma Drynariae on bone histomorphology and formation, and their local effect on bone healing. Methods: For the investigation of the systemic effect, thirty 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into three groups: (1) control group, ten mice fed daily with distilled water; (2) Rhizoma Curculiginis group, ten mice fed daily with distilled water mixed with Rhizoma Curculiginis extract; (3) Rhizoma Drynarie group, ten mice fed daily with distilled water mixed with Rhizoma Drynarie extract. The mice were fed for five weeks before sacrifice. Twenty micro-tomographic slices with an increment of 0.25 mm were prepared to cover the proximal end of the left tibia of each mouse. Quantitative morphometry of the bone structure was performed. For the investigation of the local effect on bone healing, two bone defects (5 × 10 mm) were created in the parietal bone of each of the three New Zealand white rabbits. Two defects in the first animal were grafted with collagen matrix with Rhizoma Curculiginis extract; two defects in the second animal were grafted with collagen matrix with Rhizoma Drynarie extract; two defects in the third (control) animal were grafted with collagen matrix alone. The animals were sacrificed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological and ultrastructural assessment. Results: Rhizoma Curculiginis and Rhizoma Drynariae extracts altered the bone histomorphology, both increasing the trabecular number by 10% (P = 0.002). Rhizoma Curculiginis extract increased bone density by 3.13% (P = 0.122) and Rhizoma Drynariae extract increased bone density by 6.45% (P = 0.005). Both Rhizoma Curculiginis and Rhizoma Drynariae extracts induced new bone formation on the margins of the defects. Conclusion: Two 'Yang-tonifying' herbs, Rhizoma Curculiginis and Rhizoma Drynariae, were demonstrated to have systemic effects on bone histomorphology and formation as well as local bone healing. © 2007 Wong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

38549179967	Elimination of hand-wrist radiographs for maturity assessment in children needing orthodontic therapy	Our aim was to evaluate the validity of the cervical vertebra maturation (CVM) method as an indicator of skeletal age during the circumpubertal period by correlating the CVM method with the hand-wrist maturation (HWM) method in an attempt to eliminate the need for hand-wrist radiographs for maturity assessment. Hand-wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs of 400 Chinese were randomly selected. The age for girls was between 10 years and 15 years and for boys it was between 12 years and 17 years, so that they were within the circumpubertal period. The CVM was assessed by a method developed by Baccetti and co-workers, whereas hand-wrist maturation was assessed by Fishman's method. The CVM was significantly correlated with HWM skeletal age. (Spearman's r boys=0.9206, girls=0.9363). All the patients in cervical vertebra stage 3 (CVS3) of CVM corresponded to skeletal maturation indicator 2 (SMI2) or SMI3 stages of HWM (around the peak of the growth spurt). The method error was insignificant. CVM is a valid indicator of skeletal growth during the circumpubertal period.

40749108459	Factors regulating endochondral ossification in the sphenooccipital synchondrosis	Objectives: To identify the temporal pattern of core-binding factor a1 (Cbfa1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expressions in the spheno-occipital synchondrosis in vitro with and without tensile stress. Materials and Methods: Sixty male BALB/c mice were randomly divided into an experimental group (with tensile stress) and a control group (without tensile stress) at each of five time points. Animals were sacrificed and the cranial base synchondroses were aseptically removed. In the experimental groups, mechanical stress was applied on the surgical explants with helical springs and incubated as organ culture for 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours. In the control group, the springs were kept at zero stress. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for quantitative analysis of Cbfa1 and VEGF expression. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed that Cbfa1 and VEGF expressions reached a peak increase at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Compared with the control groups, both Cbfa1 and VEGF were expressed consistently higher in the experimental groups at all time points. Conclusion: Mechanical stress applied to the spheno-occipital synchondrosis elicits Cbfa1 expression and subsequently up-regulates the expression of VEGF. Increased levels of expression of both factors could play a role in the growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. © 2007 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

40749118457	Patients' perceptions regarding microimplant as anchorage in orthodontics	Objective: To determine patients' expectations, acceptance, and experience of pain with microimplant surgery compared to other orthodontic procedures. Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight microimplants were placed in 37 patients as an anchorage unit for orthodontic treatment. Patients were asked to rate anticipated pain and pain experienced with various orthodontic procedures (tooth extraction, insertion of separators, initial tooth alignment, and microimplant surgery) on a visual analog scale (VAS) over a 7-day period. One month after insertion of microimplants, patients were asked to rate their acceptance of the procedure using a structured questionnaire. Results: Unlike other orthodontic procedures, patients expected to experience a significantly higher level of pain with microimplant surgery than they experienced (P < .001). The postoperative pain experienced decreased continuously from day 1 to day 7 for all orthodontic procedures (P < .05). The total area under the curve (AUC) of pain experienced over the 7-day period was significantly larger for initial tooth alignment than for microimplant surgery (P < .05). Most patients were satisfied with the microimplant surgery (76%) and would recommend it to a friend or family member (78%). Conclusions: Patients tended to overestimate the pain anticipated with microimplant surgery. Patients were accepting of the surgery and would recommend it to others. © 2008 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

40849086297	The inhibitory effects of naringin on the growth of periodontal pathogens in vitro	Naringin is a flavonoid that is commonly found in grapefruits. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of naringin on the growth of periodontal pathogens such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis in vitro. For comparison, the effects of naringin on several oral microbes were also studied. Different concentrations of naringin solution were added to calibrated suspensions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis. All the suspensions were incubated for 3, 6 and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37°C. At each time point, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar plates. Colonies recovered on blood agar were visually counted on days 3 and 5, respectively. A. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 3 h when naringin was added at baseline. P. gingivalis also showed a marked growth reduction in the presence of naringin, and no colony forming units could be observed after 24 h. Naringin also had an inhibitory effect against all bacteria and yeasts tested. The results suggest that naringin possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro. It also has an inhibitory effect on some common oral microorganisms in low concentrations. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A total of 18 bone defects (5 mm by 10 mm) were created in the parietal bone of 9 New Zealand White rabbits. Six defects were grafted with genistin mixed with collagen matrix, while 6 were grafted with collagen matrix alone (positive control) and 6 were left empty (negative control). Animals were killed on day 14 and defects were prepared histologically. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation and bone cells was carried out on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 520% more new bone was present in defects grafted with genistin in collagen matrix than in defects grafted with collagen matrix alone (p<0.0001), while no bone was formed in the negative control group. The amount of bone forming osteoblasts was also significantly greater in the genistin group than the positive control group. Therefore, genistin in collagen matrix can increase new bone formation locally in vivo.

77954375263	Genes, genetics, and Class III malocclusion	To present current views that are pertinent to the investigation of the genetic etiology of Class III malocclusion. Class III malocclusion is thought to be a polygenic disorder that results from an interaction between susceptibility genes and environmental factors. However, research on family pedigrees has indicated that Class III malocclusion might also be a monogenic dominant phenotype. Recent studies have reported that genes that encode specific growth factors or other signaling molecules are involved in condylar growth under mechanical strain. These genes, which include Indian hedgehog homolog (IHH), parathyroid-hormone like hormone (PTHLH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and variations in their levels of expression play an important role in the etiology of Class III malocclusion. In addition, genome-wide scans have revealed chromosomal loci that are associated with Class III malocclusion. It is likely that chromosomal loci 1p36, 12q23, and 12q13 harbor genes that confer susceptibility to Class III malocclusion. In a case-control association study, we identified erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 (EPB41) to be a new positional candidate gene that might be involved in susceptibility to mandibular prognathism. Most of the earlier studies on the genetic etiology of Class III malocclusion have focused on the patterns of inheritance of this phenotype. Recent investigations have focused on understanding the genetic variables that affect Class III malocclusion and might provide new approaches to uncovering the genetic etiology of this phenotype. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

79952279639	Evaluation of bone thickness around the mental foramen for potential fixation of a bone-borne functional appliance: A computer tomography scan study	Aim: A mandible bone-borne Herbst appliance (MBBHA) would avoid the proclination of the lower incisors that occurs with any teeth-borne functional appliance. But mapping of the bone characteristics at potential fixation areas around the mental foramen has not been carried out so far. The aim of this computer tomographic (CT) study was to evaluate bone thickness at specific positions around the mental foramen. Material and methods: CT scans of 60 randomly chosen adult Hong Kong Chinese subjects (mean age 28±6.3 years) were used to measure the bi-cortical bone thickness in the mandible in the mental foramen area. The thickness of buccal and lingual cortical and cancellous bone was assessed at the following locations: 10mm (A10mm) and 5mm (A5mm) anterior, 10mm (P10mm) and 5mm (P5mm) posterior, and 5mm (Inf5mm) below the mental foramen. Results: The amount of buccal cortical bone thickness ranged between 1.89mm, 10mm anterior of the mental foramen, and 2.16mm, 10mm posterior to its location. At the A10mm level, cortical thickness showed a marginal statistically significant difference between A5 and A10mm. The total amount of bone thickness ranged from 10.19 to 12.06mm. Conclusion: At the locations studied around the mental foramen, a mean bicortical bone thickness of 10-12mm was measured. No large variation in the thickness was found between bicortical bone thicknesses in the measured locations around the mental foramen. Thorough evaluation on a case-by-case basis is advisable. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

43049159677	Effect of tensile force on expression of PTHrP and thickness of hypertrophic zone in organ-cultured mouse spheno-occipital synchondroses	Objective: Responses of spheno-occipital synchondroses to direct tensile stress have not been identified before. This study was, therefore designed to evaluate expression of PTHrP, and thickness of hypertrophic zone in spheno-occipital synchondroses in response to such stress, using mouse in vitro model. Methods: Spheno-occipital synchondroses together with adjacent structures were excised from fifty-five 2-day-old mice that were randomly assigned to 6 control and 5 experimental groups for 5 experimental periods (n = 5). In the experimental groups, tensile force of 0.2 g was applied across the synchondroses, using helical springs. In 5 control groups, the springs were made inactive. Both groups were then cultured for 6, 24, 48, 72 h and 7 days. Another control group was cultured without any springs for 7 days to compare with natural growth of the synchondroses from a group of five 9-day-old mice. Alcian blue-PAS staining was used to study growth of the synchondroses; immunohistochemical staining to identify PTHrP and type X collagen expression. The area of PTHrP expression and thickness of hypertrophic zone, demarcated by type X collagen expression, were measured. Results: Quantitative analysis showed that PTHrP expression increased significantly at hour 24 of the force application in the experimental group (p < 0.05), then reduced from hour 24 to 72 with a significant drop from hour 24 to 48 (p < 0.01); and the thickness of hypertrophic zone significantly increased at hour 48 (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that the growth of spheno-occipital synchondroses could be modified by tensile stress; and a light continuous force could enhance its growth, as evidenced by an increase in PTHrP expression and thickness of hypertrophic zone. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

42049119633	An immunolocalization study of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 of bone graft healing on parietal bone	This immunolocalization study was performed to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP) 1 within endochondral and intramembranous bone grafts during the early stages of healing, in the hope of gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms of bone graft healing, which could influence the choice of bone graft used. Twenty-seven adult New Zealand White rabbits were used as the experimental model. Autogenous bone grafts taken from the cranial bone (intramembranous in origin) and the femur (endochondral in origin) were grafted into skull defects created on either side of the parietal suture. Rabbits were killed on days 1 to 9 postgrafting, and the bone graft alone was harvested for immunolocalization of TIMP-1. In endochondral bone grafts, TIMP-1 was expressed on days 1 to 3, followed by a period of absence until days 8 and 9. Intramembranous bone grafts did not express TIMP-1 until days 6 to 9. The timing and location of TIMP-1 expression coincided with osteogenesis, which indicates a role for TIMP-1 in preserving newly formed bone during the initial stages of graft healing. The differential temporal expression of TIMP-1 in endochondral and intramembranous bone grafts suggests that bone graft type plays an important role in influencing the healing process mediated by the host tissues. The earlier expression of TIMP-1 in endochondral bone grafts could be the reason for delayed vascularization of defects containing these grafts, whereas the delayed expression of TIMP-1 in intramembranous bone grafts could allow earlier vascularization of the intramembranous bone grafts. ©2008Muntaz B.

42149183172	Effect of Salvia miltiorrhiza extract on bone formation	Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) is a Chinese medicine used for treatment of cardiac diseases through improving blood circulation. Our laboratory compared the amount of new bone formed in collagen matrix with SM extract to that formed in the collagen matrix alone. Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm x 10 mm were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, six defects were grafted with collagen matrix with SM extract. In the control groups, six defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (positive control) and six were left empty (negative control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across each defect. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group of SM and positive control) using image analysis. A total of 478% more new bone was present in defects grafted with SM extract in collagen matrix than those grafted with the collagen matrix alone. Very little new bone was formed in the passive control group. In conclusion, SM extract in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally and can be used for bone grafting especially in cases with compromised vascular responses. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

42349110540	Chinese red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus-fermented rice) promotes bone formation	Background: Statin can induce the gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2. Red yeast rice (RYR, Hongqu), i.e. rice fermented with Monascus purpureus, contains a natural form of statin. This study demonstrates the effects of RYR extract on bone formation. Methods: Bone defects were created in the parietal bones of two New Zealand white rabbits. In the test animal, two defects were grafted with collagen matrix mixed with RYR extract. In the control animal, two defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone. UMR 106 cell line was used to test RYR extract in vitro. In the control group, cells were cultured for three durations (24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours) without any intervention. In the RYR group, cells were cultured for the same durations with various concentrations of RYR extract (0.001 g/ml, 0.005 g/ml and 0.01 g/ml). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay were performed to measure total protein, mitochondrial activity and bone cell formation respectively. Results: The test animal showed more formation of new bone in the defects than the control animal. RYR significantly increased the optical density in the MTT assay and ALP activity in vitro. Conclusion: RYR extract stimulated new bone formation in bone defects in vivo and increased bone cell formation in vitro. © 2008 Wong and Rabie; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

44949201615	Use of Miniscrews and Miniplates in Orthodontics	Paradigms have started to shift in the orthodontic world since the introduction of mini-implants in the anchorage armamentarium. For example, miniscrews have allowed the management of wider discrepancies than those treatable by conventional biomechanics because force can be applied directly from the bone-borne anchor unit. Therefore, miniscrews not only free orthodontists from anchorage-demanding cases, but they also enable clinicians to have good control over tooth movement in 3 dimensions. This review will illustrate the versatility of skeletal anchorage provided by mini-implants in the correction of malocclusion, focusing on orthodontic or orthopedic movements in the 3 spatial planes. Adjunctive orthodontic treatments in adult periodontal conditions and treatment for impacted teeth with the aid of miniscrews will also be discussed. © 2008 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

45849118280	Correlation between chronological age, cervical vertebral maturation and fishman's skeletal maturity indicators in southern Chinese	Objective: To investigate the correlation between chronological age, cervical vertebral maturation (CVM), and Fishman's hand-wrist skeletal maturity indicators in southern Chinese. Materials and Methods: Four hundred contemporary hand-wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs of southern Chinese subjects were randomly selected and analyzed. The female subjects were between 10 and 15 years of age, and the male subjects were between 12 and 17 years of age; all subjects were within the circumpubertal period. The CVM was assessed using the method developed by Baccetti and coworkers, but the hand-wrist maturation was assessed using the method developed by Fishman. These two methods and the chronological age were correlated using the Spearman rank correlation analysis. Results: The CVM was significantly correlated with the hand-wrist skeletal age (Spearman r male = 0.9206, female = 0.9363). All patients in the cervical maturation stage (CS3) of CVM were discovered to be in the skeletal maturational indicator (SMI2 or SMI3) stages of hand-wrist maturation (HWM), which was around the peak of the growth spurt. Low correlations were found between the CVM and chronological age (male r = 0.7577; female r = 0.7877) and between the HWM and chronological age (male r = 0.7492; female r = 0.7758). Conclusions: CVM is a valid indicator of skeletal growth during the circumpubertal and has a high correlation with the HWM for the southern Chinese population. However, the low correlations found between the chronological age and both CVM and HWM showed that the chronological age was not suitable to measure skeletal maturity. © 2008 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

49149126753	Effect of quercetin on bone formation	Quercetin is a flavonol, also a phytoestrogen, available commonly in onions and apples. Our laboratory compared the amount of new bone produced by quercetin in a collagen matrix to that produced by bone grafts and a collagen matrix. Eighteen bone defects, 5 × 10 mm were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, six defects were grafted with quercetin solution mixed with a collagen matrix. In the control groups, six defects were grafted with a collagen matrix alone (active control) and six were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across each defect. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 556% more new bone was present in defects grafted with quercetin in a collagen matrix than those grafted with a collagen matrix alone. No bone was formed in the passive control group. In conclusion, quercetin in a collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally, and can be used as a bone graft material. © 2008 Orthopaedic Research Society.

53049101770	Condylar growth and mandibular positioning with stepwise vs maximum advancement	Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of several Class II malocclusion treatments on condylar growth and positioning of the mandible. Methods: The material comprised series of lateral cephalograms obtained at the start, after about 6 months, and after about 12 months of treatment from 3 groups of consecutively treated patients who used a headgear-activator with stepwise mandibular advancement (HGA-S), a headgear-activator with maximum jumping of the mandible (HGA-M), and a headgear-Herbst appliance with stepwise advancement (HGH-S), respectively. Six-month growth data from matched controls were used to calculate the net treatment effects. Results: Mandibular prognathism was enhanced after stepwise advancement but not after maximum jumping, and only during the initial phase of therapy; the effect was significantly greater for the fixed functional appliance than for the removable functional appliance. Lower-facial height was increased by the HGA-S, unchanged by the HGA-M, and restrained by the HGH-S. The low construction bite of the HGH-S meant that the extent of bone apposition on the posterior and superior parts of the condyle was similar, whereas the high construction bite of the HGA-S and the HGA-M meant that the effect on the superior part was greater, but only significantly so after stepwise advancement. Conclusions: The mode of jumping, the vertical opening, and whether the functional appliance is fixed or removable affect the amount and pattern of condylar growth, and the position of the mandible. © 2008 American Association of Orthodontists.

54249159289	Stability of connected mini-implants and miniplates for skeletal anchorage in orthodontics	The aim of this study was to examine the primary stability of connected mini-implants and miniplates. Three different skeletal anchorage systems were investigated: (1) two 1.5 mm diameter cylindrical mini-implants connected with a 0.021 × 0.025 inch stainless steel (SS) wire, (2) two 1.6 mm diameter tapered mini-implants connected with a 0.021 × 0.025 inch SS wire, and (3) two 2.0 mm diameter cylindrical mini-implants connected by a titanium locking miniplate. Fifteen standardized bovine bone specimens were prepared, five specimens for each experimental group. The connected mini-implants were fixed on the bone specimens. The systems underwent uniaxial pull-out tests at the midpoint of the connecting wire or miniplate using a mechanical testing machine. One-way analysis of variance was used to determine the difference of the pull-out test results between the groups.Both the titanium miniplate and SS wire connection systems showed severe deformation at the screw head, which broke before the mini-implants failed. The 2.0 mm miniplate system showed the highest pull-out force (529 N) compared with the other two wire connection systems (P < 0.001). The 2.0 mm system was also stiffer than the 1.6 and 1.5 mm systems (P < 0.001). The yield force of the 2.0 mm miniplate (153 N) was significantly higher than the 1.5 mm (88 N) and 1.6 mm (76 N) systems (P < 0.001).This in vitro study demonstrated that the connection of two mini-implants with a miniplate resulted in higher pull-out force, stiffness, and yield force to resist pulling force and deformation. Such a set-up could thus provide a stable system for orthodontic skeletal anchorage. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Orthodontic Society.

63549113278	The assessment of cell cycle genes in the rat mandibular condyle	Objectives: We aimed to investigate the expression profile of cell cycle genes in the mandibular condyle on mechanical strain and natural growth, and quantify their expression intensity. Methods: Three hundred and fifty 35 days old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into experimental groups fitted with bite-jumping appliances and control groups. Groups were sacrificed at days 1, 3, 7, 9, 14, 30, and 33. Then, condyles were dissected and total RNA was extracted for microarray analysis. Results: Thirty-nine known cell cycle genes were present in the condyle, where Cyclin D1, PCNA, and Wnt5a were differentially expressed. Reverse transcriptase-PCR confirmed that Wnt5a showed a 2-fold increase on experimental day 1, Cyclin D1 showed a 2-fold increase on experimental day 1 and a 3-fold increase on experimental day 14, while PCNA shows 2.2-fold increase both on experimental days 9 and 30. PCNA, Cyclin D1, and Wnt5a were all expressed by cells in both the proliferative layer and erosive zone. Conclusion: Mandibular advancement leads to the expression of Cyclin D1 that accelerates entry to the S phase. The increased level of PCNA indicates increased DNA replication of MSC. Then, elevated level of Wnt5a indicates the commitment of MSC to the chondrogenic lineage. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

65049091606	The molecular markers for condylar growth: Experimental and clinical implications	The outpour of new research has led to the identification of several factors that play an important role in condylar growth. The objectives of this review are to present the molecular markers that regulate the growth of different cells in the mandibular condyle and their impact on clinical use of functional appliance. The proliferative layer in the mandibular condyle houses a great number of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells that provide the pool of chondrogenic cells. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors that regulate the cell cycle of these replicating mesenchymal cells as well as the factors that control their differentiation to chondroblasts. These chondroblasts in turn are engaged in cartilage matrix synthesis. Therefore, it is critical to present the factors that regulate matrix formation. The process of maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes directly impacts the number of cell replication cycles and indirectly affects growth. Therefore, it is of great importance to review the factors that regulate chondrocytes maturation. Hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete hypertrophic matrix with its type X collagen that marks the onset of endochondral ossification. Angiogenesis is regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the new blood vessels are rich depository of mesenchymal cells. Factors that regulate the differentiation of these cells into osteogenic cells are critical to growth of the condyle. Understanding of these markers and their levels of expression provides the basis for application of different treatment modalities in the area of growth modification. Furthermore, the identification of factors critical to condylar growth provides us with candidate genes for future gene therapy. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd and the Japanese Orthodontic Society.

67349227158	The role of salivary factors in persistent oral carriage of Candida in humans	Background: Candida albicans is a commensal oral yeast in approximately one-third to one-half of the healthy population. To date, there are no studies investigating the multiple anti-candidal salivary constituents of healthy individuals with either nil or, consistent oral yeast carriage. Objective: To compare the composition and anti-candidal activity in stimulated whole saliva of healthy 'consistent' oral Candida carriers with Candida-free individuals. Methods: A sub-sample of 22 consistent, Candida-free individuals and 10 consistent Candida carriers were recruited from a 12 months screening study investigating oral Candida carriage in 97 healthy patients treated by fixed orthodontic appliances. Unstimulated and stimulated saliva samples were collected. The following salivary attributes were measured using standard methodology: the flow rate, pH, lysozyme, lactoferrin and IgA concentration and, the degree of inhibition of blastoconidial growth and blastospore germination. Results: Saliva from the Candida-free individuals showed 20.2% higher inhibition of blastoconidial growth (p < 0.05) of a reference strain of Candida albicans. No significant differences between the other salivary attributes of the two groups were found. Conclusion: The fact that saliva of Candida-free individuals significantly inhibited the blastoconidial growth more than Candida-carriers (p < 0.05) suggests that saliva may play a role in modulating oral candidal populations in health. Further studies, with a larger cohort are needed to confirm these findings and determine the factors that confer enhanced salivary anti-candidal activity. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67650527269	The effects of Rhodiola rosea extract on 5-HT level, cell proliferation and quantity of neurons at cerebral hippocampus of depressive rats	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of Rhodiola rosea extract and depression on the serotonin (5-HT) level, cell proliferation and quantity of neurons at cerebral hippocampus of depressive rats induced by Chronic Mild Stress (CMS). Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups (10 per group): normal control group, untreated depressive rat model group, negative control group, positive control group, low dosage Rhodiola rosea extract (1.5 g/kg) group, medium dosage Rhodiola rosea extract (3 g/kg) group and high dosage Rhodiola rosea extract (6 g/kg) group. After the depressive rats induced by CMS had received Rhodiola rosea extract for 3 weeks, the 5-HT levels at cerebral hippocampus were detected by high performance liquid chromatography. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected in vivo to label the proliferating cells at hippocampus, and morphometry was used to count the hippocampal neurons. The results showed that the 5-HT level of the three experimental groups had recovered to normal status. The immunohistochemistry of hippocampus BrdU positive cells had returned to the normal level in the group of depressive rats with low dosage Rhodiola rosea extract. In conclusion the results demonstrated that Rhodiola rosea extract could improve 5-HT level in hippocampus in depressive rats, and low dosage Rhodiola rosea could induce neural stem cell proliferation at hippocampus to return to normal level, repairing the injured neurons at hippocampus. © 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

68949214450	The effects of orthodontic appliances on Candida in the human mouth	Background. Candida is an opportunistic pathogen present in about 50-60% of the healthy human population, and becomes pathogenic when the host immune defence is undermined such as in HIV infection. Adhesion and colonization of the oral cavity by Candida albicans is an initial step in candidosis, and the presence of orthodontic and other oral appliances seems to alter the oral ecological environment, hence may tip the balance to favour the candidal presence. Objective. The purpose of this paper was to review the literature with specific attention to prevalence; intra-oral density of the candidal organisms; and Candida carriage status in orthodontic patients before, during, and after treatment. Conclusions. The limited amount of literature demonstrated that the density of Candida increases; the most common Candida species isolated in the orthodontic patients was C. albicans; and that there seems to be a direct relationship between the presence of a removable appliance, Candida, and low salivary pH levels. No healthy patients developed Candida infection from the orthodontic appliances. However, there seems to be a trend that some non-Candida carriers converted to Candida carriers following the insertion of the appliances by unknown mechanism. This may indicate a more cautious approach when providing orthodontic treatments to immunocompromised children concerning the possible increased risk of candidal infection. © 2009 BSPD, IAPD and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

68349123743	Stepwise advancement herbst appliance versus mandibular sagittal split osteotomy	Objective: To compare the treatment effects and long-term stability of the stepwise Herbst appliance and mandibular sagittal split osteotomy in skeletal Class II adult patients.Materials and Methods: Subjects comprised 16 patients in the Herbst group and another 16patients in the surgery (mandibular sagittal split osteotomy) group. Lateral head films were takenbefore treatment (T0), after removal of the Herbst appliance/surgery (T1), after the fixed appliancetreatment (T2), and 3 years after treatment (T3). All films were analyzed by standard cephalometricsand SO-analysis (analysis of changes in sagittal occlusion).Results: All Herbst and surgery patients were treated successfully to Class I occlusal relationships with normal overjet and overbite. Both groups showed a significant change in mandibular baseadvancement (SNB, SNPg, Pg/OLp), which resulted in a decrease in the ANB angle, the Witsappraisal, and facial convexity. However, the surgery group showed larger changes in the parametersmentioned above. In terms of long-term stability, both groups achieved stable results, and no significant difference occurred over time.Conclusion: Stepwise advancement Herbst appliance therapy can be used to treat borderlineskeletal Class II adult patients with long-term stability.

70350447308	Use of cervical vertebral maturation to determine skeletal age	Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of the cervical vertebral maturation (CVM) method as an indicator of skeletal age in the circumpubertal period by correlating it to the hand-wrist method (HWM). Methods: Hand-wrist and lateral cephalometric radiographs of 400 Chinese subjects were randomly selected. Their ages were 10 to 15 years for girls and 12 to 17 years for boys, so they were within the circumpubertal period. Skeletal ages were assessed according to the CVM method and the HWM. Results: The CVM was significantly correlated with HWM skeletal age (Spearman r = 0.9521 [boys] and 0.9408 [girls]). All patients in cervical vertebral stage 3 of the CVM corresponded to stages MP3-FG or MP3-G (around the peak of the growth spurt) in the HWM. Conclusions: The CVM is a valid indicator of skeletal growth during the circumpubertal period, providing information for timing of growth modification. © 2009 American Association of Orthodontists.

Methods: In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 55 subjects with TMJ and/or masticatory pain (Group I patients according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorder (RDC/TMD) received Ping On ointment for 4 weeks, or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analogue scale and maximal comfortable mandibular opening, at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment. Results: Ping On ointment significantly reduced the symptoms of painful TMJs and/or masticatory muscles. Maximal comfortable mandibular opening also improved in the Ping On ointment group compared with the placebo, but was not clinically significant. Conclusions: This preliminary study suggests that topical application of Ping On ointment may be considered for further investigation as a potential first-line treatment modality, before prescribing analgesics, for the management of TMDs. It is topically applied, safe, reversible, and effective in managing TMDs and masticatory muscle pain. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

77951662888	Nanocoating of montmorillonite/Mg-β-tricalcium phosphate on orthodontic titanium miniscrews	Mini-implants (1-2 mm in diameter) are miniscrews that are placed in the jaw bones to help Orthodontists move teeth in a controlled manner. The reasons behind their increasing popularity over the past decade is that mini-implants are easily placed and removed under local anaesthetic and can withstand up to 300g force. Unfortunately, their high rate of failure (10-30%) poses a problem to clinicians and their patients alike. Advances in the field of nanotechnology presented a wide range of solutions to biological problems.

77953273395	Inhibitory effect of quercetin on periodontal pathogens in vitro	Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) are bacteria strongly associated with early onset, progressive and refractory periodontal disease and associated alveolar bone loss. Quercetin is a flavonoid found in many foods including apples, onions and tea. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of quercetin on in vitro growth of periodontal pathogens Aa and Pg. For comparison, quercetin's effect on several oral microbes was also evaluated. Different concentrations of quercetin solution were added to calibrated suspensions of Aa and Pg. All suspensions were incubated for 1, 3, 6, and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37° C. At each time point, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar plates. Colonies appearing on blood agar plates were visually counted on 3 days for Aa and 5 days for Pg. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of both periodontal pathogens were also determined. Both periodontal bacteria showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 1 h. No colony forming units of Pg could be observed after 24 h. The results suggest that quercetin possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

77953285735	Antimicrobial activity of Chinese medicine herbs against common bacteria in oral biofilm. A pilot study	Twenty traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four common oral bacteria. TCMs were tested for sensitivity against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Aliquots of suspension of each bacterial species were inoculated onto a horse blood agar plate with TCMs soaked separately on 6 mm paper disks. The plates were incubated for 48 h anaerobically and the mean diameters of growth inhibition of three different areas obtained. 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine was used as a positive control. Broth microdilution assay was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. Fructus armeniaca mume was effective against all four bacteria. Thirteen TCMs demonstrated antimicrobial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, including Cortex magnoliae officinalis, Cortex phellodendri, Flos caryophylli, Flos lonicerae japonicae, Fructus armeniaca mume, Fructus forsythiae suspensae, Herba cum radice violae yedoensitis, Herba menthae haplocalycis, Pericarpium granati, Radix et rhizoma rhei, Radix gentianae, Ramulus cinnamomi cassia and Rhizoma cimicifugae. Cortex phellodendri showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, while Radix et rhizoma rhei was effective against Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis. Fructus armeniaca mume had inhibitory effects against Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

77953419905	Orthodontic tooth movement enhancing bony apposition in alveolar bony defect: A case report	Introduction: Prevalence of complications from orthognathic surgery is relatively low but if it happens it is vital to manage the post complication bony defect appropriately. Case Presentation: This case report describes a 20-year-old gentleman who suffered from a complication from a bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. A bone grafting was carried out to repair the bony defect from the surgery but it was unsuccessful. A non-invasive technique employing the use of very light orthodontic force with a laceback stainless steel ligature is described and a successful space closure with an improvement in the periodontal condition and bone apposition has been shown. Conclusion: This technique can be considered if orthodontic tooth movement is needed across a deficient alveolar ridge. © 2009 Hibino and Wong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

77953895506	Effect of Buguzhi (Psoralea corylifolia fruit) extract on bone formation	The objective of the study is to compare the amount of new bone produced by Buguzhi (Psoralea corylifolia fruit) extract in collagen matrix to that produced and collagen matrix in vivo. Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 10 mm, were created in the parietal bone of 9 New Zealand white rabbits. Six defects were grafted with Buguzhi extract mixed with collagen matrix. Six defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (positive control) and 6 were left empty (negative control). Animals were sacrificed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation and bone cells was made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 275% more new bone was present in defects grafted with Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix than those grafted with collagen matrix. No bone was formed in the negative control group. The amount of bone cells was also significantly greater in the Buguzhi group than in the positive control group. To conclude, Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally in vivo. Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix can be used as a bone graft material.

77953451764	Repair of a defect following the removal of an impacted maxillary canine by orthodontic tooth movement: A case report	This case report describes a 13-year-old boy with alveolar bony defect resulted from surgical removal of impacted upper canine transposed in the anterior region. The boy had a normal occlusion with malposition of upper central and lateral incisors. The treatment objectives were to align teeth, close spaces by mesial movement of the buccal segments in the upper jaw to repair bone loss. Fixed appliance with palatal root torque was used for the mesial movements, levelling, and alignment of teeth. Orthodontic tooth movement consisted of a sequence of root movement in a direction to increase the thickness of the labial cortical plate of bone, could ensure healthier periodontium. A healthier periodontium prior to space closure ensured repair of alveolar bony defect after surgical intervention. Orthodontic tooth movement should be added to our armamentarium for the repair of alveolar bony defect.

77955642208	Assessment of maxillary position: Implant vs cephalometric methods	Objective: To compare changes in maxillary position assessed from a maxillary implant and three cephalometric methods based on linear measurements. Methods: Series of tracings of the maxilla obtained around puberty from an implant study were analyzed. The displacement of the implant was used to determine the direction and amount of "actual" maxillary growth. Displacement of point A was measured according to three cephalometric methods. The values obtained from absolute, horizontal, and vertical displacement of point A by three cephalometric methods and by the implant method were compared. Results: Results showed that estimation of displacement of the maxilla by three cephalometric methods (point A) was significantly larger than that of the implant method in all directions. The average difference in the horizontal plane was 0.7 mm, 1.2 mm, and 1.6 mm, respectively; the average difference in the vertical plane was 2.2 mm, 2.5 mm, and 3.6 mm, respectively. Conclusions: Estimations of changes in maxillary position by the implant method and by cephalometric methods were not proportional. All three cephalometric methods overestimated changes in the position of the maxilla. © 2010 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

77954966051	Does orthodontic tooth movement cause an elevation in systemic inflammatory markers?	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of orthodontic treatment on systemic levels of the inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The study group comprised 11 girls and 6 boys (mean age 13.1 years) treated with fixed appliances and distalizing headgear. Venous blood samples were taken from the cubital vein of each subject before treatment (T0) and then at three further time points during treatment (T1-T3), 2 months apart. The sera from these blood samples were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay technology for CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 concentration levels. Data were compared between baseline and subsequent sequential time points using a Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed variables.The results showed that there was no significant elevation of any of the three inflammatory markers at any of the time points. This research provides evidence that conventional orthodontic treatment is not associated with a systemic immune response in the factors investigated. © The Author 2009.

77954968559	A comparison of pain experienced by patients treated with labial and lingual orthodontic appliances	The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare pain experiences among Chinese adult patients treated with labial and lingual orthodontic appliances. Sixty patients, 30 with labial appliances (18 females and 12 males, mean age 20.33 years, SD ± 4.205) and 30 with lingual appliances (22 females and 8 males, mean age 21.63 years, SD ± 2.236), rated their overall pain experience on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) at three time points: 1 week (T1), 1 month (T2), and 3 months (T3) after bracket placement. In addition, on a separate 100 mm VAS, they rated their pain experience at the locations of the tongue, lips, cheeks, gums, face, and jaw at T1, T2, and T3. Changes in pain VAS were conducted using Friedman analysis of variance, area under the curve (AUC) analysis and the data were compared using a t-test.There was no significant difference in global ratings of pain among those treated with labial or lingual appliances (P > 0.05). Among both groups, global ratings of pain decreased over the study period (P < 0.001). Patients treated with lingual appliances reported higher ratings of tongue pain (P < 0.001), while those treated with labial appliances reported higher ratings of lip (P < 0.001) and cheek (P < 0.001) pain. The findings indicate that patients treated with labial and lingual appliances rate similarly the level of overall pain they experience during treatment. Ratings of overall pain experienced decreased for both treatment groups with time. However, ratings of pain differed at various sites with respect to the type of orthodontic appliance. These findings have implications in informing patients' treatment decision-making processes regarding labial and lingual appliances and in the management of discomfort associated with different treatment modalities. © The Author 2009.

77958111867	Effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on MC3T3-E1	Objective - To investigate whether VEGF has direct effects on bone cells activities and to better understand how VEGF promotes bone remodeling. Materials and Methods - MC3T3-E1 cell line was cultured with and without VEGF in vitro. The cells in both control and test groups were collected at different culture time points of 24, 48 and 72 h. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was carried out to quantify the mRNA expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa β ligand (RANKL). Results - The expression of VEGFR2 significantly increased by 53% at 24 h and remained increased by 8% at 72 h compared to control (p < 0.05). ALP showed an early increase by 73% at 24 h (p < 0.001), but dropped by 14 and 41% at 48 and 72 h, respectively (p < 0.05). OCN was down-regulated by 41% at 24 h but then up-regulated by 149% at 72 h (p < 0.001). The expression of OPG significantly decreased by 7% at 24 h (p < 0.001) while dramatically increased by 133% at 72 h (p < 0.001). RANKL remained unchanged at all three time points (p > 0.05). Conclusion - VEGF promotes bone remodeling by direct effects on osteoblastic cells via regulating gene expression of ALP, OCN, and OPG through VEGFR2 signaling pathway. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

77957775917	Virtual model analysis as an alternative approach to plaster model analysis: Reliability and validity	The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of virtual models as an alternative to orthodontic plaster models. Virtual dental models (obtained from OrthoCAD®) and corresponding plaster models of 80 patients in the permanent dentition were randomly selected from patients seeking orthodontic care. Inter-examiner error was assessed by measuring tooth width, overjet, overbite, intermolar width, intercanine width, and midline discrepancy. Criterion validity of virtual model analysis was determined by the agreement between the measurements from virtual and plaster models. Test-retest reliability was determined by remeasuring 10 virtual models 1 week later. Comparison analysis was assessed by calculating the mean directional differences and standardized directional differences. Correlation analysis was determined by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).Both intra- and inter-examiner reliability and test-retest reliability of virtual model analysis were acceptable in measuring intercanine, intermolar, overjet, overbite, midline discrepancy, space analysis, and tooth width (ICC > 0.7). Good criterion validity was indicated by agreement between the results from the plaster and virtual models (ICC > 0.8). There were substantial agreements for canine and molar relationship classifications (κ > 0.70). The results suggest that analysis performed on virtual models is as valid as traditional plaster models for intra- and inter-arch relationship. © The Author 2010.

77957866267	Identification of SNP markers on 1p36 and association analysis of EPB41 with mandibular prognathism in a Chinese population	Objective: The results of a genome-wide scan suggested that chromosome locus 1p36 might be linked to the etiology of mandibular prognathism (MP) amongst Asian ethnicities. In this study, we performed a two-stage case-control association study to determine whether one or more genes that confer susceptibility to MP are located within this genomic region. Design: In the first stage of the study, we examined 103 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 1p36 across an 8.6 Mb critical region and within four candidate genes in 158 cases and 147 controls to identify genes associated with MP. In the second stage of the study, we examined an additional 23 SNPs within the erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1 (EPB41) gene in 211 cases and 224 controls. Results: Four SNPs located in the EPB41 gene showed possible allelic and genotypic associations with MP (P < 0.03 and P < 0.05, respectively) in the first stage. In the analysis of single SNPs in the second stage, the allele of rs4654388 showed the strongest significant association with MP (P = 0.008) and the rs4654388 G-allele was associated with a significantly increased risk of MP (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.16-2.74). Haplotype analysis revealed that MP was associated significantly with haplotype GTTCAGGT (P

78649393470	Systemic effect of Fructus Psoraleae extract on bone in mice	Fructus Psoraleae extract is used in China for the treatment of bone diseases. The objective of the study was to investigate the systemic effect of Fructus Psoraleae extract consumption on bone histomorphology. Sixteen 8-week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into control and experimental groups. In the control group, eight mice were fed daily with distilled water. In the experimental group, eight mice were fed daily with distilled water mixed with Fructus Psoraleae extract. The mice were kept for 5 weeks and then killed. Using micro-computed tomography, 20 micro-tomographic slices with a separation of 0.25 mm were acquired to cover the proximal end of the left tibia of each mouse. Quantitative morphometry of the bone structure was performed. The results showed that consumption of Fructus Psoraleae extract significantly increased the bone volume/tissue volume ratio by 11.8%. The bone trabeculae increased by 7.1% in thickness so that the bone density was increased. To conclude, Fructus Psoraleae extract taken orally increases bone density and alters bone histomorphology. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

78649803052	Diagnosis and management of root resorption by erupting canines using cone-beam computed tomography and fixed palatal appliance: A case report	Introduction. Resorption of the root of the maxillary incisors during ectopic eruption of the maxillary canines is not an uncommon phenomenon, and must be considered in all patients with seriously diverging eruption of the maxillary canines. Case presentation. We report on the diagnosis and treatment of a 10-year-old Chinese boy with severe crowding and risk of root resorptions caused by impacted canines in the upper arch and reverse overjet. With the aid of cone-beam computed tomography, the upper right canine crown of our patient was positioned in close proximity to the right lateral incisor while the left canine crown was hitting the root apex of the left lateral incisor. To avoid any progress of root resorption, use of an upper fixed palatal appliance with torquing spring to move the root of lateral incisors away from the canines, plus extraction of upper primary first molars, was selected as an interceptive treatment. Conclusions. Careful planning is crucial to avoid any complication through orthodontic treatment and to reduce the treatment time and cost. © 2010 Albaker and Wong; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78650964953	Effect of psoralen on bone formation	To compare the amount of new bone and bone cells produced by psoralen in collagen matrix to that produced by collagen matrix in vivo. Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 10 were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. Six defects were grafted with psoralen mixed with collagen matrix. Six defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (negative control-collagen) and six were left empty (negative controla-empty). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation and bone cells were made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 454% more new bone was present in defects grafted with psoralen in collagen matrix than those grafted with collagen matrix. No bone was formed in the negative control-empty group. The amount of bone forming osteoblasts was also significantly greater in the psoralen group than the negative control-collagen group. Psoralen in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally in vivo.

79955895930	Effects of medicinal herb salvia miltiorrhiza on osteoblastic cells in vitro	Sufficient osteoinduction is essential for the success and effectiveness of bone grafting. It was previously found that Salvia Miltiorrhiza (SM), a commonly used Chinese herb increased osteogenesis in vivo. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of SM on bone cells in vitro, in an attempt to get a better understanding on how SM can promote bone remodeling. MC3T3-E1, an osteoblastic cell line, was cultured with SM for different time intervals (24, 48, and 72 h), whereas the control group consisted of cells cultured without any intervention. The mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin (OCN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The expression of ALP showed an early increase at 24 h by 50% (p < 0.001) and at 48 h by 13% (p < 0.001). OCN was decreased by 22% at 24 h (p < 0.001) but increased by 50% and 88% at 48 and 72 h, respectively (p < 0.001). RANKL showed an early increase at the first two time points of 24 and 48 h by 45% (p < 0.001) and 36% (p < 0.01), respectively, while OPG was up-regulated at the latter two time points by 10% at 48 h (p < 0.01) and 68% at 72 h (p < 0.001). Thus, OPG/RANKL was down-regulated first, and then up-regulated. SM enhances bone remodeling by regulating the gene expression of ALP, OCN, OPG, and RANKL. It is a potential medicinal herb to be utilized in the application that requires stimulation in bone cell activities. © 2011 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

79956270840	In vivo production of mineralised tissue pieces for clinical use: A qualitative pilot study using human dental pulp cell	Numerous previous studies have investigated the production of mineralised tissues by transplanting human dental pulp cells with calcium based scaffolds. The potential of alternative setups remains largely uninvestigated, therefore in this study, human dental pulp cells were encapsulated into non-calcium based biomaterial - self-assembling peptide nano-fibre hydrogel. The cell-gel constructs were cultured in full medium for 2 weeks. Then they were cultured in full medium supplemented with β-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone and l-ascorbic acid for 2 more weeks. These cell-gel constructs and plain-gel constructs (with no cells) were transplanted subcutaneously into five nude mice. The gel constructs were retrieved 4 weeks after surgery. The plain-gel constructs were all completely resorbed with no new tissue formation. The cell-gel constructs were transformed into tissue pieces that were mineralised and contained blood capillaries. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the expression of multiple bone markers (osteopontin, osteocalcin, osteonectin and parathyroid hormone receptor) in these tissue pieces. Computerised analysis of the contact radiographs gave the mean radio-opaque area percentage as 78% (N = 5, P < 0.001 compared with the 0% of the control). The results demonstrate good prospects for using human dental pulp cell plus self-assembling peptide nano-fibre hydrogel to produce mineralised tissue pieces for clinical use.

79957919050	Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria	Objectives. Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. Study design. A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. Result. In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. Conclusion. Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria. © 2011 The Authors.

79958051317	Comparison of oral impacts experienced by patients treated with labial or customized lingual fixed orthodontic appliances	Introduction: Our objective was to compare the oral impacts experienced by patients treated with labial or customized lingual fixed orthodontic appliances. Methods: This was an age- and sex-matched prospective longitudinal study of 60 adult patients treated with either labial or customized lingual fixed orthodontic appliances over a 3-month period. Ratings of oral impacts experienced and satisfaction were made on visual analog scales at 3 time points after appliance fixation. Variations in oral impacts and satisfaction over the trajectory of treatment were assessed. Area-under-the-curve analyses were conducted to assess variations in oral impacts and satisfaction between the groups. Results: All patients experienced oral impact disturbances, although these disturbances decreased over time (P <0.001). Patients treated with customized lingual appliances reported more oral discomfort (P <0.001), dietary changes (P <0.001), swallowing difficulty (P <0.001), speech disturbances (P <0.001), and social problems (P <0.001) than did those in the other group. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding ratings of oral self-care, mastication, and satisfaction level of treatment (P >0.05). Conclusions: The findings indicate that oral impacts are commonly experienced during both labial and customized lingual fixed orthodontic therapies. However, the oral impacts decreased over the observational period. Patients treated with customized lingual appliances experienced more oral impacts. Both groups had similar levels of treatment satisfaction. © 2011 by the American Association of Orthodontists.

Methods: The case subjects consisted of healthy Chinese people living in Hong Kong with skeletal Class I relationships and at least 5 mm of crowding in either arch. The control subjects met the same requirements but lacked crowding or spacing. SNP genotyping was performed on the MassARRAY platform. The chi-square test was used to compare genotype and allele type distributions between the case and the control groups. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and the effects of age and sex for each SNP. Analyses of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype associations between SNPs were performed with software. Results: Five SNPs were found to be significantly different in genotype or allele type distributions. SNP rs372024 was significantly associated with crowding (P = 0.004). Two SNPs, rs3764746 and rs3795170, on the EDA gene were found to be associated marginally. SNPs rs1005464 and rs15705 also exhibited marginal association with crowding. The effects of associated SNPs remained significant after adjustments for age and sex factors. Conclusions: This study suggests an association for the genes EDA and XEDAR in dental crowding in the Hong Kong Chinese population. Copyright © 2011 by the American Association of Orthodontists.

80052205713	3D CBCT McNamara's cephalometric analysis in an adult southern Chinese population	Preliminary results were determined for a database on 3-dimensional (3D) cephalometrics using McNamara's analysis in an adult southern Chinese population based on cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT). 3D dentoskeletal morphology was assessed from CBCTs from 80 (39 males; 41 females; 21-30 years) consecutive adult southern Chinese without gross craniofacial deformity or asymmetry, adopting 16 variables from McNamara's cephalometric method. For variables in relation to maxilla to cranial base, mandible to cranial base and dentition, there were no significant differences between males and females. For variables in relation to mandible to maxilla, 8 of 11 showed significant differences between males and females: Cd(L)-Gn (♂: 127.65 mm; ♀: 119.56 mm, P < 0.01), Cd(R)-Gn (♂: 127.85 mm; ♀: 119.94 mm, P < 0.01), Cd(L)-A (♂: 99.38 mm; ♀: 94.18 mm, P < 0.01), Cd(R)-A (♂: 93.93 mm; ♀: 94.99 mm, P < 0.01), MxMD-DF(L) (♂: 28.26 mm; ♀: 25.40 mm, P < 0.05), MxMD-DF(R) (♂: 27.74 mm; ♀: 24.02 mm, P < 0.05), ANS-Me (♂: 71.09 mm; ♀: 65.84 mm, P < 0.01), and MD-P(L) (♂: 22.85°; ♀: 25.25°, P < 0.05). The method errors did not exceed 0.5 mm for any variables. A preliminary CBCT cephalometric database of the population was created. The significant sexual differences in the 3D McNamara's analysis indicate that gender specific data should be made available. The sample size should be increased to create a more representative database. © 2011 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

80053550371	Comparison of the antimicrobial activity of Listerine and Corsodyl on orthodontic brackets in vitro	Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of 2 commercially available mouth rinses on a monospecies-biofilm model on orthodontic brackets in vitro. Methods: The antimicrobial effects of the 2 mouth rinses, Listerine (tartar control; IDS Manufacturing, Bangkok, Thailand) and Corsodyl (SmithKline Beecham, Maidenhead, United Kingdom), on the planktonic Streptococcus mutans were tested by maximum inhibitory dilution assay. The cell viability of S mutans biofilm on Damon3 MX brackets (Ormco, Glendora, Calif) after exposure to the 2 mouth rinses was quantified by 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay. Visualization of the biofilm samples was performed by fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: The maximum inhibitory dilution assays of S mutans were 1:5 for Listerine and 1:320 for Corsodyl. The optical density values, which were measured by XTT reduction assay from S mutans biofilms after 1 minute of exposure to the different test agents, demonstrated that the cell viability of S mutans biofilms exposed to Listerine was less than that for Corsodyl, which was less than that for brain-heart infusion (P <0.001). Listerine caused more dead cells on the surface of the brackets than did Corsodyl when examined with the 2 microscope systems. Conclusions: Both mouth rinses showed marked antimicrobial effects on the monospecies biofilm in vitro. Listerine showed a stronger bactericidal effect but had less bacterial inhibitory effect than did Corsodyl.

80054902967	Resveratrol inhibits periodontal pathogens in vitro	The gram-negative anaerobic bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) and P. gingivalis (Pg) are key components in the aetiology of periodontal disease, and associated hard-tissue destruction. Resveratrol is a phytoalexin, produced naturally by several plants when under attack by bacterial or fungal pathogens. It is found in many foods including mulberries, peanuts and the skin of labrusca and muscadine grapes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on the in vitro growth of periodontal pathogens Aa and Pg. For comparison, resveratrol's effect on a variety of other oral microorganisms was also evaluated. Resveratrol demonstrates a poor solubility in water, thus different concentrations of resveratrol in the solvent dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were added to calibrated suspensions of Aa and Pg. As a control, a parallel series of dilutions containing the vehicle DMSO alone was made to measure the effect of the solvent. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of the periodontal pathogens were calculated. All suspensions were incubated for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h in an anaerobic chamber at 37 °C. At each time interval, selected dilutions from each culture broth were plated on blood agar plates. Colonies appearing on blood agar plates were visually counted at 3 days for Aa, and at 5 days for Pg. The periodontal bacteria showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in viable counts after 1 h, whilst no colony forming units could be observed after 24 h. The results suggest that resveratrol possesses significant antimicrobial properties on periodontal pathogens in vitro. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84858629895	The effect of quercetin on expression of SOX9 and subsequent release of type II collagen in spheno-occipital synchondroses of organ-cultured mice	Objective: To identify the expressions of SOX9 and type II collagen in spheno-occipital synchondrosis in response to quercetin, using a mouse in vitro model. Materials and Methods: A total of 50 one-day-old male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. Each group was subdivided into five different time points, which were 6, 24, 48, 72, and 168 hours, and each subgroup contained 5 mice (n = 5). In the experimental group, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis was immersed in the BGJb medium + quercetin dihydrate 1 μM. In the control group, the spheno-occipital synchondrosis was immersed in the BGJb medium. Tissue sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for SOX9 and type II collagen expressions. Results: Quantitative analysis revealed there was a statistically significant increase of 32.31% (P <.001) in the expression of SOX9 between experimental groups and control groups at 24 hours. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant increase of 22.99% (P <.001) in the expression of type II collagen between experimental groups and control groups at 72 hours. Conclusion: The expressions of SOX9 and type II collagen in the spheno-occipital synchondrosis can be increased by quercetin. © 2012 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

84864260041	The role of vascular endothelial growth factor in ossification	Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are two closely correlated processes during bone growth, development, remodelling and repair. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an essential mediator during the process of angiogenesis. Based on an extensive literature search, which was carried out using the PubMed database and the keywords of osteogenesis, VEGF, endochondral ossification and intramembranous ossification, this manuscript reviews the role of VEGF in ossification, with emphasis on its effect in endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Osteogenesis and angiogenesis are closely correlated processes. VEGF acts as an essential mediator during these processes. It not only functions in bone angiogenesis but also in various aspects of bone development. © 2012 WCSS. All rights reserved.

84867702952	Neuroprotective effect of preadministration with Ganoderma lucidum spore on rat hippocampus	The aim of this study was to investigate if preadministration with Ganoderma lucidum spore (GLS) could (1) alleviate oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in rat hippocampus of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of streptozotocin (STZ), (2) protect neurons from apoptosis, and (3) improve cognitive dysfunction. Three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were preadministrated with GLS at doses of 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0. g/kg, respectively, for 3 weeks before the ICV STZ injury. Thereafter the rats were operated with ICV STZ (1.5. mg/kg) bilaterally on days 1 and 3. The behavioral alterations, oxidative stress indexes, ATP, cytochrome oxidase (CytOx), and histopathology of hippocampal neurons were studied. The results showed that ICV STZ model rats exhibited a significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), a significant decrease of glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH), ATP and CytOx, accompanied with marked impairments in spatial learning and memory, and severe damage of hippocampal neuron. In conclusion, preadministration with GLS at dose of 8.0. g/kg in ICV STZ rats significantly reversed these abnormalities. In conclusion, preadministration with GLS might protect hippocampus from oxidative impairment and energy metabolism disturbance of ICV STZ. This may also provide useful information for future research on the pathogenesis and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). © 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

84872035046	The adjunct effectiveness of diode laser gingivectomy in maintaining periodontal health during orthodontic treatment: A randomized controlled clinical trial	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of diode laser gingivectomy as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment in the management of periodontal health among patients receiving fixed orthodontic appliance therapy (FOAT). Materials and Methods: Thirty patients undergoing FOAT with gingival enlargement were block randomized into two treatment groups. The test group received diode laser gingivectomy (940-nm diode laser, ezlase, Biolase Technology Inc) as an adjunct to nonsurgical periodontal treatment. The control group received nonsurgical periodontal treatment only. For both groups, five periodontal parameters were assessed at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months: Plaque Index, Gingival Index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and Gingival Overgrowth Index. Intra- and intergroup variations in the periodontal parameters were determined over time. Results: Both groups showed statistically significant improvements in periodontal health over the study period (P < .05). However, significant improvements in periodontal health were evident earlier among the test group subjects (P < .05). The magnitude of improvement in periodontal health compared to baseline was greater in the test group than in the control group for Gingival Overgrowth Index at 1 month (P < .001) and 3 months (P < .05), Gingival Index at 3 months (P < .05) and 6 months (P < .05), and probing pocket depth at 1 month (P < .05). Conclusions: Nonsurgical periodontal management with or without the adjunct use of lasers can be effective in the management of gingival health problems among patients receiving FOAT. The adjunctive use of lasers can produce an earlier and greater improvement in gingival health. © 2013 by The EH Angle Education and Research Foundation, Inc.

84872397665	Effect of different advancement positions on the maximum retrusive force of the mandible	Introduction- Functional appliances lead, in different degrees, to loss of anchorage in the lower arch. By anchoring them to the mandibular bone, any dental side effects may be avoided and the skeletal effect enhanced. Stability of bone-borne fixation would be affected by forces created by the pull of the masticatory muscles. We aimed to identify mean maximum forces produced by mandibular retrusive muscles, at different degrees of advancement. Subjects and methods- Eighteen healthy adult volunteers participated in the study. Maximum retrusive force was measured using a splint/load cell system. Readings of the maximum forces of retrusion were taken from five mandibular positions: unstrained retruded position, and 4, 5, 6, and 7mm anterior to the unstrained position. Data were presented as means±SD and anova was performed to examine statistical significant differences between means of the maximum retrusion force. Results- Mean maximum retrusion force ranged between 63.3 and 198.2 newtons at the unstrained and 7mm positions, respectively. It increased as the distance of advancement increased, being statistically significantly (p<0.05) less at unstrained position compared with all advancement distances, 4mm of advancement than 6 and 7mm advancement, 5mm of advancement than at 7mm advancement. Conclusion- Magnitude of the forces exerted by muscles during voluntary maximum retrusion movement from different advancement positions increased proportionately as the retrusion distance increased up to 7mm. Such range of high forces might be important to consider when designing a bone-borne functional appliance. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84875693994	Altered serum levels of the osteoclast-specific TRACP 5b isoform in Chinese children undergoing orthodontic treatment	Orthodontic tooth movement is dependent upon the ability of mechanical forces to induce remodelling activity within the tooth-supporting alveolar bone. In view of the importance of bone resorption in mediating tooth movement, the aim of this study was to establish if alterations in the osteoclast-specific bone marker tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRACP) 5b could be detected in the sera of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. The sample consisted of 14 subjects (10 girls and 4 boys) aged 10.5-16.5 years (mean 12.6 years) being treated with fixed appliances and a distalizing headgear. Venous blood samples (3 ml) were collected from the cubital vein pre-treatment (T0) and 2, 4, and 6 months into treatment (T1-T3); serum TRACP 5b levels were quantified using a solid-phase immunofixed enzyme activity assay. When the data were pooled and treated cross-sectionally, a significant increase in immunoreactive TRACP 5b was detected at 2 months (T1) indicating increased bone resorptive activity. However, when the serum profiles of individual patients were recorded longitudinally, a very different pattern emerged, not all patients following the same trend. This is not surprising given normal anatomical variation and differences between the patients in age, gender, and mechanotherapy. Designed as a pilot to demonstrate 'proof of principle', this study is the first to show that the TRACP 5b isoform can be detected in the sera of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. It further suggests that serum bone marker measurements offer a simple and minimally invasive method for correlating the findings of laboratory and animal experimentation with clinical data. © 2011 The Author.

84885422538	The effects of natural compounds-containing mouthrinses on patients with fixed orthodontic appliance treatment: Clinical and microbiological outcomes	Aim: To investigate the effects of two natural compounds-containing mouthrinses (NCCMs) (a fructus mume (FM) extract-containing mouthrinse and an essential oil (EO)-containing mouthrinse) on gingival health and microbial profiles in young orthodontic patients. Design: This 6-month randomized, single-blinded, parallel-controlled clinical trial consists of 90 patients with fixed appliance treatment. The subjects were allocated to (1) negative control group: oral hygiene instruction (OHI) alone; (2) test group 1: OHI plus EO mouthrinse; and (3) test group 2: OHI plus FM mouthrinse. Clinical examinations included plaque index (PI), bleeding index (BI) and modified gingival index (MGI). Salivary microbial quantifications included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, Streptococci and Lactobacilli counts. Clinical and microbiological examinations were conducted at baseline, 3rd and 6th months (T1, T2, and T3). Results: BI was significantly reduced in both the FM mouthrinse and EO mouthrinse groups compared with the negative control group at T3 (P < 0.05). There were no significant intergroup differences in salivary bacteria counts in all groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Both NCCMs effectively reduced gingival bleeding without causing significant alterations of microbial profile in young orthodontic patients. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd, BSPD and IAPD.

0141725406	Statin collagen grafts used to repair defects in the parietal bone of rabbits	We compared the amount of new bone produced by statin collagen grafts with that produced by collagen grafts. Fifteen bone defects were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, five defects were grafted with simvastatin dissolved in water for injection mixed with absorbable collagen sponge. In the control groups, five defects were grafted with water for injection mixed with absorbable collagen sponge alone (active control) and five were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across the whole defect. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 100 sections using image analysis. A total of 308% more new bone was present in defects grafted with statin collagen grafts than those grafted with collagen grafts alone (P < 0.0001). No bone was formed in the passive control group. In conclusion, statin collagen grafts were osteoinductive and can be used as a material for bone grafts. © 2003 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84890476476	The effect of naringin on early growth and development of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis as measured by the expression of PTHrP and Sox9-an in vitro model	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the flavonoid naringin on the growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis by quantifying the levels of expression of Sox9 and PTHrP in an in vitro mouse model. Fifty 1-day-old BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to experimental or control groups, and each group equally divided into five time frames (6, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours). The mice were sacrificed with phenobarbitone sodium, and the spheno-occipital synchondroses dissected and cultured in control or experimental medium, with the experimental medium supplemented with 0.1 m naringin. Sections of the specimens underwent immunohistochemical staining for Sox9 and PTHrP, and the amount of expression was quantified using true-colour RGB (red-green-blue) computer-assisted image-analysing system with digital imaging. Data analysis showed there was a significant increase of expression of Sox9 at 6 and 24 hours (P < 0.001) between experimental and control groups, however, there was no significant difference between the levels of expression of PTHrP between experimental and control groups at any of the time frames. There was a very weak correlation found in this study between the expression of PTHrP and Sox9. In conclusion, naringin enhances the growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis through over expression of Sox9. This is a successful in vitro model to study factors regulating the growth of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis. © 2012 The Author.

84891561140	Natural compounds containing mouthrinses in the management of dental plaque and gingivitis: A systematic review	Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of natural compounds containing mouthrinse (NCCM) as an adjunct to unsupervised oral hygiene in the management of dental plaque and gingivitis. Materials and methods: An electronic search for clinical studies of NCCMs was conducted in Medline-PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE for a period spanning from the earliest available date in each database up to February 2013. Plaque index, gingival index, and gingival bleeding index were selected as primary outcomes. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed according to the "Levels of Evidence" outlined by the Center of Evidence-Based Medicine, and to the Jadad scale. Results: The screen yielded 2,236 titles and abstracts that met the inclusion criteria. These identified 11 clinical trials testing 13 different NCCMs, and were used for data extraction. Heterogeneity and the limited number of studies on any individual NCCM precluded a formal meta-analysis. Of the 13 NCCMs tested, eight demonstrated positive results, and few reported any adverse effects or events. Conclusions: Evidence proving the effectiveness of NCCM as an adjunct to unsupervised oral hygiene for plaque and gingivitis control is still insufficient. However, some natural products (compounds) may have oral health benefits, so further high-quality study is warranted. Clinical relevance: This review provides an overview of the strength of clinical evidence regarding the effectiveness of natural compounds containing mouthrinses in promoting gingival health. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84892437483	The role of traditional chinese medicines in osteogenesis and angiogenesis	The article aims to review various Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) with both osteogenic and angiogenic effects, alone and in combination, and to consider whether these TCMs promote osteogenesis via angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Each of the TCMs involving in osteogenesis was searched through PubMed and CBMdisc using its Latin name and English name, and keywords such as 'osteogenesis', 'bone', 'osteoblast', 'angiogenesis', 'VEGF' were used. A total of 241 articles were screened from PubMed and CBMdisc. The articles were only chosen if they discussed the relationship of the TCMs with bone formation and/or angiogenesis. Twenty-seven articles were chosen, of which 16 were in English and 11 were in Chinese with English abstract. As a result, the TCMs (Danshen or Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, Danggui or Angelica sinensis, Astragalus membranaceus Bunge or Huangqi, and Ge Gan or Puerarin radix) that have a relationship with both osteogenesis and angiogenesis were screened out. It is found that the aforementioned TCMs enhance angiogenesis and osteogenesis. They show a positive effect on bone formation, and the possible mechanisms may be related to their ability to promote angiogenesis via an effect on substances such as VEGF.

84899477175	Salvia Miltiorrhiza Induces VEGF expression and regulates expression of VEGF receptors in osteoblastic cells	This study investigated in vitro whether Salvia Miltiorrhiza Bunge (SM) induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and regulates expression of VEGF receptors 1 (VEGFR-1) and 2 (VEGFR-2) on osteoblasts. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured with SM and VEGF at points 24, 48 and 72 h. A blank control was included. The mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. VEGF protein expression was examined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. SM increased VEGF mRNA expression by 21% at 24 h (p < 0.05), 5% (p < 0.05) at 48 h and 74% (p < 0.001) at 72 h, while external VEGF intervention decreased the internal VEGF expression by 51% at 24 h (p < 0.001) and increased it by 126% at 72 h (p < 0.001). SM increased VEGF protein at 72 h (p < 0.05). VEGFR-1 mRNA expression, in response to SM, decreased by 8% (p < 0.05) at 72 h and decreased following VEGF at 24 and 72 h by 20% (p < 0.001) and 15%, respectively, (p < 0.001). VEGFR-2 mRNA expression increased following SM at 24 and 48 h by 25% (p < 0.05) and 73% (p < 0.05), respectively, and decreased at 72 h by 13% (p < 0.05). It was concluded that SM modulated expression of VEGF and its receptors in MC3T3-E1 cells. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

11844306556	Early healing pattern of statin-induced osteogenesis	We examined the early histological expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and core binding factor (Cbfa1) in healing bones with and without a statin (simvastatin). Thirty bone defects were created in the parietal bones of 15 New Zealand white rabbits. In the statin group (n = 9), the defects were grafted with carriers of collagen matrix mixed with simvastatin solution, and the animals were killed on days 1 (n = 1), 2 (n = 1), 3 (n = 2), 4 (n = 2), 5 (n = 2) and 6 (n = 1) after operation. In the collagen matrix group, the defects were grafted with carriers of collagen matrix mixed with water for injection, and killed on days 1-6 postoperatively. Immunolocalisation studies of the defects grafted with statin showed that VEGF was expressed on day 3 postoperatively, BMP-2 on day 4, Cbfa1 on day 5 and that new bone was formed by day 5. These events occurred one day earlier than in the group grafted with the carrier alone. The statin induced and accelerated formation of bone locally, and triggered the early expression of growth factors that regulate angiogenesis, differentiation of bone cells, and osteogenesis. © 2004 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.
