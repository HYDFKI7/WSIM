33645956572	Method of view range evaluation based on image processing technology	View range is one of the main integrated performance indexes for night view systems, and is also the important performance index needed to give when night view systems leave factory. Finally the performance of night view systems express as view range. So the size of view range directly determines integrated performance of night view systems. Therefore, how to evaluate view range of systems objectively and effectively is the main problem that both producers and users concern. Based on low night level view detection function and image threshold contrast, a new objective view range evaluation method of night view system is proposed in this article with image processing technology, least-square polynomial fitting, vision sense formula under glimmer light circumstance and other knowledge. For validating the method, six groups experimentation with field situation of six kinds night view system have been finished respectively. The results of experiment indicates that the new method has effectively improved the speed of view range measurement of night view system with good precision and practicability. Therefore, the method has scientific guidance meanings to analyze low night level night view system performance, make technique index sure, improve and develop the night view system performance.

33747471062	Theoretical calculation of the modulation transfer function in a femto-second electron diffraction system	This article has introduces the basic components and characteristics of a femto-second electron diffraction system, i.e. the photo-cathode, magnetic lens, deflector and detector with doubled MCP etc., and demonstrated our design method and results. The photo-cathode is an Ag film deposition on a sapphire disk and the femtosecond electron pulses are accelerated to 50 keV through an extraction electric field of 10 kV/mm between the photocathode and the extraction mesh. After extraction, the electron pulses are reshaped in size by a 100 μm pinhole, which screens out electrons with larger elevation angle and makes the passed electrons flying almost parallel to the axis, which results in a reduced electron beam spot. The beam is collimated with a magnetic lens and positioned to the sample by a pair of deflection plates for diffraction measurements. The electron diffraction images are recorded with a two-dimensional imaging system composed of a Chevron-type microchannel plate and a P20 phosphor screen on an optical-fiber faceplate. The initial position, kinetic energy and angle distribution of the photoelectrons are sampled with Monte Carlo method. The electric field is calculated with finite difference formula, and the magnetic flux of the focus region is calculated with finite elements methods, and the electron trajectory is traced with Runge-Kutta method. We analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution of 3000 electrons when they reached the prime plane and gave out the temporal and spatial modulation transfer function of the femto-second electron diffraction system.

The structures of Ge thin films deposited on ceramic and quartz glass substrates and influences of technical parameters on resistance were studied. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of thin films deposited on the two substrates shows that the thin films deposiited on two kinds of substrates both have cubic amorphous Ge structure. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images indicate that the film deposited on quartz glass is more compact and smooth than that deposited on the ceramic substrate. If the film on the ceramic substrate is too thin, the film is discontinuous, which induces the high resistance. The resistance can be controlled by annealing, depositing rate, or thickness of film. The performance of the system, which adopted Ge layers with different resistance, was studied. These results suggest that resistance of the charge induced layer influences spatial resolution less than the counting rate.

A special circuit was developed and a low-level x-ray pulse profile measurement experiment system was setup. The arrival times of x-ray photon sequence can be consecutively recorded with a time resolution of 500 ps and the profile of x-ray pulse was constructed. The data also can be used for analysis by many other methods, such as statistical distribution of photon events per time interval, statistical distribution of time interval between two photon events, photon counting histogram, autocorrelation and higher order autocorrelation. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

79959899455	X-ray photon-counting detector based on a micro-channel plate for pulsar navigation	The pulse time of arrival (TOA) is a determining parameter for accurate timing and positioning in X-ray pulsar navigation. The pulse TOA can be calculated by comparing the measured arrival time with the predicted arrival time of the X-ray pulse for pulsar. In this study, in order to research the measurement of pulse arrival time, an experimental system is set up. The experimental system comprises a simulator of the X-ray pulsar, an X-ray detector, a time-measurement system, and a data-processing system. An X-ray detector base is proposed on the basis of the micro-channel plate (MCP), which is sensitive to soft X-ray in the 1-10 keV band. The MCP-based detector, the structure and principle of the experimental system, and results of the pulse profile are described in detail. In addition, a discussion of the effects of different X-ray pulse periods and the quantum efficiency of the detector on pulse-profile signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is presented. Experimental results reveal that the SNR of the measured pulse profile becomes enhanced as the quantum efficiency of the detector increases. The SNR of the pulse profile is higher when the period of the pulse is smaller at the same integral. © 2011 Chinese Optics Letters.

84859417675	Optical quantum random number generator based on the time randomness of single-photon pulse	An optical quantum random number generator based on the time randomness of single-photon pulse is proposed. A constant-intensity light source attenuating into single-photon state and a single photon detector are used to generate single-photon random pulses. The random bits are extracted by continuously comparing the time intervals between two adjacent pulses in the single-photon random pulses sequence. A random number generation rate of more than 10 M bit/s is obtained by designing high-speed single-photon detector based on micro-channel plate and field programmable gate arry (FPGA) based random bit extraction circuit. In order to reduce the correlation coefficient of random bit sequence, measurement accuracy of the time interval is improved by using a constant fraction discriminator and a frequency-multiplied counting clock. Correlation coefficient of the random bit sequence is less than 0.001, when the random bit generation rate is less than 10 k bit/s. The random bit sequences are tested by random number test program ENT and DIEHARD. The test results show that random bit sequences have good randomness, do not require post-processing and fully meet the standards of true random numbers.

84859469432	Decoding algorithms for improving the imaging performance of Vernier anode readout	The Long Slit Spectrograph is one of instruments onboard The World Space Observatory-Ultraviolet. Both the FUV (102-1700nm) and NUV (160-320nm) channels of LSS choose micro-channel plates (MCP) detector with anode readout in the focal plane. The MCP detectors with anode readout are typically used to provide photon counting imaging. According to the desired performance of LSS, the Vernier anode may be the optimum readout scheme. The Vernier anode is famous for its high spatial resolution, however, the original decode algorithms of the Vernier anode is susceptible to wrongly decode, when the charge acquisition is not precise enough and the footprint size of charge cloud collected by Vernier anode is not small enough and eventually results in the deterioration of photon counting image. In this paper, the causes leading to image deterioration is analyzed. The least-squares method was used to calculate the phase value to correct imaging distortions caused by charge measurement accuracy. The area ratio of each electrode covered by charge cloud is accurately calculated to improving the imaging results. The corrected algorithms are verified by experimental results and the results show that the correction methods can obviously improve the quality of the original photon counting image. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84860534829	A new time-domain estimation method for period of pulsars	The estimation of pulsar period is important for pulsar searching, observation and timing. In this paper, the frequency-domain method which is popular in periodicity searches is analyzed, and further more, a novel method in time-domain is proposed to estimate the cyclo-period of pulsars based on the second-order cyclo-stationary model of the radiation signal. Firstly, the discrete-time observing signal is blocked by assumed period which is alterable. Then, the correlation estimations and their sample variances are computed each as a function of blocking operator index, where the largest peaks display a periodic pattern, from which the cyclo-period can be obtained. Using this method, the period of PSR J0437-4715 with single pulse is estimated well based on original signal, and the period of PSR B1821-24 with double pulses is also estimated based on the simulated signal. The same work is done for the observed data from ATNF EPN pulsar database. The simulation results and the experimental results for many pulsars show that compared with the classical Fourier-transform method, this algorithm is non-sensitive to the noise, and it is effective even though in the case of low signalto-noise ratio. And it is of low computation complexity compared with the bispectrum coherence method. This method possesses higher popularization value in real-time observation and processing for weak pulsar signal, though it does not work well in dealing with noncontinuous observing data. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84868526629	Research of the navigation accuracy for the X-ray pulsar navigation system	In order to improve the navigation accuracy of the X-ray pulsar navigation system, in this paper we propose a constant fraction timing method based on the low-pass filter to measure the arrival time of the X-ray pulse in X-ray pulsar navigation. According to the technical scheme, the timing accuracies and dead times of original peaking timing and the improved constant fraction timing are measured. Experimental results indicate that the timing accuracy and the dead time of the peaking timing system are 18 ns and 4750 ns, the timing accuracy and the dead time of the constant fraction timing system are 0.78 ns and 105 ns. The timing accuracy and the dead time of constant fraction timing system are significantly improved compared with those of the peaking timing system. In the X-ray pulsar navigation system, the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse is constructed in the two different timing systems through measuring the arrival time of the X-ray photon. Experimental results indicate that compared with using the peaking timing system, the cumulative pulse profile of the X-ray pulse using the improved constant fraction timing system is improved obviously, therefore, the navigation accuracy could be improved by using the constant fraction timing system. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

84873247021	Theoretical research on time-space conversion method for measuring ultra-short electron pulse width	The transmission characteristics of ultra-short electron beams of the ultra-fast electron guns in scanning state were analysed, and the deflection distance of the ultra-short electron beams passing the deflection-scan system was calculated. The results indicate that the initial voltage must be within the range of 700-1400 V to counterbalance the effect of the negative scan slope voltage, ensuring that the electron beams will pass the deflection-scan system and finally hit the phosphor screen of 30 mm in diameter, and the cooperative function of the initial voltage and the negative scan slope voltage is one of the two premises of the scan experiment. The other premise is the synchronization of the electrical and the optical signals. Following the discussion of the great difficulty caused by the first promise, an experimental system that can adjust the optical delay more effectively in the scan experiment was designed, which can facilitate the synchronization of the negative scan slope voltage and the ultra-fast electron pulse.

84879860174	An analog modulated simulation source for X-ray pulsar-based navigation	In this paper a high resolution X-ray simulation source is proposed and designed to verify the navigation based on X-ray pulsar in the simulation experience system. The simulation source consists of an arbitrary signal generator and a grid controlled X-ray tube. According to the grid tube's characteristic curve, the data of the pulsar standard pulse template are converted. Then using the method of direct digital frequency synthesis, the converted data are synthesized to waveforms, called the analog modulated grid voltage. In the grid controlled X-ray tube, the grid voltage changes the number of electrons hitting on the target and controls the X-ray intensity. With an analog modulated pulse profile applied on the tube grid electrode, the tube will emit X-rays which will match photons' statistical distribution and simulate the X-ray pulsar profile extremely well. The properties of Crab pulsar simulation source are tested in X-ray pulsar navigation simulation experience system. The results of the test are as follows: Comparing the tested pulse profile with the standard pulsar profile, we have time correlation coefficient is 0.9774, and frequency correlation coefficient is 0.9853.

84880084110	Research of X-ray pulsar navigation simulation source	As an autonomous navigation method, X-ray pulsar navigation can provide position, timing and attitude information for various spacecrafts. Since the X-rays (1-20 keV) from the pulsar can not penetrate the earth atmosphere, an X-ray source in laboratory needs to be set up to test and calibrate the detector. In this paper an arbitrary X-ray pulse source to simulate the neutron pulsar signal is proposed. The main components of the simulation source are a grid controlled X-ray tube and arbitrary pulse generation electronics.

84881579012	Next generation of space wireless communication technology based on X-ray	In the field of space wireless communication, laser and microwave technology have become mature, but bottleneck problems such as the limited transmission distance, the limited communication rate and so on already exist, which restrict the future applications in deep space. As a result of its short wavelength and great penetrability, X-ray has no attenuation for transmission in space when its photon energy is more than 10 keV (λ<0.1 nm). Thus, via X-ray, a communication technology of long distance signal transmission in space can be achieved with smaller volume, lower weight and lower power. However, studies on X-ray communication and its applications still remain blank in China presently. X-ray communication was proposed and defined as a "revolutionary concept" by National Aeronautics and Space Administration of USA just a short time ago. Thus, the study on this novel space communication method with a new conception by using X-ray as information carrier will have a great scientific significance and applicable prospect. X-ray communication technology will not only be a good complement to laser and microwave communications, but will also have a unique performance on those occasions where laser and microwave could have been shielded. Study on space wireless communication technology based on X-ray will include: the theoretical research on X-ray space transmission; the research on a high power and wide bandwidth(GHz) modulated X-ray source for pulse signal; the research on high speed, week signal of X-ray detection technology; the research on acquisition, tracking and pointing technology of X-ray space communication; the research on high efficient coding theory and technology.

84907246918	Research on shared anode used for the large area array MCP detector	The development of signal acquisition system used for the large area array of microchannel plate detector is very difficult. Multi-channel shared anode was put forward to solve this technical issue. Dual-channel shared anode and four-channel shared anode were designed. According to the basic standard that multi-channel Shared anode instead of single channel anode, signal transmission characteristics and collection efficiency were tested. Simulation experiment results show that signal transmission in multi-channel shared anode without attenuation and distortion, and the experimental results and simulation results are identical with each other; dual-channel shared anode's total count rate and four-channel shared anode's count rate are approximately equal to the sum of single channel anode count rate, the relative error of the count rate are 5.2%, 7.4% respectively. Four-channel shared anode can replace single channel anode and dual-channel shared anode, and the number of channels about electronics acquisition system is reduced to 1/4 of the original.

84923052767	Novel space communication technology based on modulated x-ray source	A novel space communication method is presented in this paper based on X-ray photons. As a result of its short wavelength and great penetrability, X-ray has no attenuation for transmission in space when its photon energy is more than 10keV (λ<0.1nm). Thus a communication technology of long distance signal transmission in space can be achieved with smaller volume, lower weight and lower power. Therefore, X-ray communication (XCOM) is especially valuable to the deep space missions, which will be able to realize higher data rates, smaller SWAP than with RF and laser communications. Using X-ray photons as information carrier will not only be a good complement to laser and RF communications, but will also have unique applications when RF and laser signals are not available like the spacecraft's re-entering to the earth. High-speed modulation and high-sensitivity detection of X-rays are two major technical issues which should be addressed in order for the X-ray communication to take place. A Grid-controlled Modulated X-ray tube (GMXT) is proposed and developed as X-ray transmitter. One or more specially designed grid electrodes are added to the traditional X-ray tube to modulate the electrons. The communication signal is coded and applied to the modulated grid electrode, and then the corresponding X-ray signals are generated and sent out. X-ray detector based on micro-channel plate(MCP) is used as communication receiver because of its high temporal resolution. An audio communication experiment system based on XCOM is setup in laboratory including the X-ray transmitter and the receiver. X-ray communication is successfully demonstrated and the communication speed reaches 64 kilobits per second in a vacuum tube of 6 meters long. As a new concept of space communication, X-ray communication will have more important scientific significance and application prospects when technologies for X-ray modulation and detection are further developed.
