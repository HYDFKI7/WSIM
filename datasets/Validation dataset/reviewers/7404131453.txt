23444446758	Effects of inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis D-PDMP on proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells	Aim: To explore the effects of inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis D-PDMP on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Methods: Neural stem cells cultured in vitro were treated with different concentration of D-PDMP. The effects of D-PDMP on proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells' were evaluated by counting of neurospheres size and cellular number, MTT assaying and the experiment of inducing differentiation. Results: Neurospheres were smaller in size after treated with D-PDMP. The data of cellular counting and MTT assay suggested that D-PDMP could inhibit proliferation of neural stem cells and lead cells' death in higher concentration, D-PDMP also reduced the differentiation ability of neural stem cells. Although differentiated cells were fewer, they could be induced into neurons and astrocytes. Conclusion: The inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis D-PDMP could inhibit the proliferation of neural stem cells, even lead cells death. It also reduced the differentiation ability of neural stem cells.

33749059723	Associated risk factors of knee osteoarthritis: A population survey in Taiyuan, China	Background: Since knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the common diseases, identification of its associated risk factors is of preventive significance. This investigation was designed to investigate the prevalence of KOA in Taiyuan, and identify the associated risk factors of KOA. Methods: A population sample was surveyed of 2188 adults aged from 35 to 64 years, living in 6-story buildings without elevators. The protocol of Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology (APLAR) Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) core questionnaire was implemented. The data on knee pain and KOA were collected and analyzed. Variables such as sex, age, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), education level, and smoking history, were included in binary logistic regression model for further analysis. Results: The prevalence rates of knee pain and KOA were 13.6% and 10.9%, respectively, significantly higher than those in Shantou of south China and similar to those in Beijing of north China. The prevalence of KOA was significantly higher in women than in men (18.3% versus 8.7% and 15.1% versus 6.3%), with a tendency of increase with age. The prevalence was increased more obviously in women after 40 years old and in men after 45 years old. BMI in KOA group was significantly higher than that in non-KOA group. Binary Logistic regression revealed that age, sex, and BMI were significantly associated with KOA, whereas no significant correlation was seen between KOA and other factors such as climbing stairs, WC, time length of occupation service, education level, smoking history and religious belief. Conclusion: Geography, age, sex, and BMI might be the risk factors of KOA, but climbing stairs, WC, time length of occupation service, education level, smoking history and religious belief are not correlated with KOA. Prevention of KOA should be initiated before the middle-age, especially in female adults, and weight control is necessary. Other factors might also contribute to the development of KOA, but further study is needed to elucidate the role of these factors.

34249695441	The association of HLA-DRB1 alleles with rheumatoid arthritis in the Chinese Shantou population: A follow-up study	We investigated the distribution of HLA-DRB1 alleles in a sample of the Chinese Shantou population, and explored the relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles and the susceptibility and clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We studied 117 consecutive patients with RA and control groups, including 38 cases of systemic lupus erythematosus and 100 healthy individuals. HLA-DRB1 genotyping was performed using PCR with sequence-specific primers. HLA-DRB1*04 subtypes were detected using spot hybridization of PCR products with sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. We compared the frequency of HLA-DRB1 alleles in healthy control patients with that in patients with RA. Patients with RA were evaluated for sex, age at disease onset, disease duration, extra-articular involvement, presence of autoantibodies, global functional status, and radiographic damage. The frequency of HLA-DRB1*04 was found to be significantly higher in RA patients than in healthy individuals (49.6% vs 18.0%, odds ratio = 4.478, P < 0.001). HLA-DRB1*0405 was the most prominently associated subtype in RA patients (62.1% vs 27.8%, odds ratio = 4.255, P = 0.011). Compared with the HLA-DRB1*04-negative RA group, the mean duration of RA in the HLA-DRB1*04-positive RA group was longer, and the mean age at disease onset was lower. A 2-9 year follow-up study was performed, and the risk factors associated with the radiographic progression of RA were determined. Logistic regression analysis revealed that only HLA-DRB1*04 alleles were significantly associated with the radiographic progression of RA (B = 2.652, P = 0.018, Exp(B) = 14.182). Our observations indicated that the HLA-DRB1*04 alleles, especially the subtype HLA-DRB1*0405, were significantly associated with RA susceptibility in the Chinese Shantou population. The HLA-DRB1*04 alleles may be associated with the severity of RA. © 2007 NRC.

34548061783	Enhanced antitumor effect of combined triptolide and ionizing radiation	Purpose: The lack of effective treatment for pancreatic cancer results in a very low survival rate. This study explores the enhancement of the therapeutic effect on human pancreatic cancer via the combination of triptolide and ionizing radiation (IR). Experimental Design: In vitro AsPC-1 human pancreatic cancer cells were treated with triptolide alone, IR alone, or triptolide plus IR. Cell proliferation was analyzed with sulforhodamine B (SRB) method and clonogenic survival; comparison of apoptosis induced by the above treatment was analyzed by annexin V - propidium iodide (PI) staining. Furthermore, the expression of apoptotic pathway intermediates was measured by the assay of caspase activity and Western blot. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential was determined by JC-1 assay. In vivo, AsPC-1 xenografts were treated with 0.25 mg/kg triptolide, 10 Gy IR, or triptolide plus IR. The tumors were measured for volume and weight at the end of the experiment. Tumor tissues were tested for terminal nucleotidyl transferase - mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemistry. Results: The combination of triptolide plus IR reduced cell survival to 21% and enhanced apoptosis, compared with single treatment. In vivo, tumor growth of AsPC-1 xenografts was reduced further in the group treated with triptolide plus IR compared with single treatment. TUNEL and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3 cleavage in tumor tissues indicated that the combination of triptolide plus IR resulted in significantly enhanced apoptosis compared with single treatments. Conclusions: Triptolide in combination with ionizing radiation produced synergistic antitumor effects on pancreatic cancer both in vitro and in vivo and seems promising in the combined modality therapy of pancreatic cancer. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

77954313896	Biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles by foliar broths: Roles of biocompounds and other attributes of the extracts	Biosynthesis of nanoparticles has arisen as a promising alternative to conventional synthetic methodologies owing to its eco-friendly advantages, and the involved bioprotocol still needs further clarification. This research, for the first time from the standpoint of statistics, confirmed an electrostatic force or ionic bond-based interaction between the chloroauric ions and the involved bioconstituents and manifested that reducing sugars and flavonoids were both important reductants responsible for conversion of Au(III) to Au(0). The result also demonstrated that the proteins were not the reducing agents, yet they might be protection agents in biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). Besides, a significant linear relationship was found between the anti-oxidant ability of the foliar broths and their capability to reduce Au(III) into Au(0). Furthermore, the preliminary investigation based on the boxplot on the size/shape distribution of the biosynthesized GNPs revealed that gold nanospheres with higher degree of homogeneity in size tended to be promoted by foliar broths containing higher content of reducing sugars/flavonoids and proteins. Otherwise, i.e., for those broths with lower content of the above biocompounds, sphere GNPs of wider size distribution or even gold nanotriangles tended to be fabricated. © 2010 The Author(s).

84866600513	HLA-DQ association and allele competition in Chinese narcolepsy	In Japanese, Koreans and Caucasians, narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency is tightly associated with the DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:02 haplotype. Studies in African-Americans suggest a primary effect of DQB1*06:02, but this observation has been difficult to confirm in other populations because of high linkage disequilibrium between DRB1*15:01/3 and DQB1*06:02 in most populations. In this study, we studied human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II in 202 Chinese narcolepsy patients (11% from South China) and found all patients to be DQB1*06:02 positive. Comparing cases with 103 unselected controls, and 110 and 79 controls selected for the presence of DQB1*06:02 and DRB1*15:01, we found that the presence of DQB1*06:02 and not DRB1*15:01 was associated with narcolepsy. In particular, Southern Chinese haplotypes such as the DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*06:01 and DRB1*15:01-DQA1*01:02-DQB1*05 were not associated with narcolepsy. As reported in Japanese, Koreans, African-Americans and Caucasians, additional protective effects of DQA1*01 (non-DQA1*01:02) and susceptibility effects of DQB1*03:01 were observed. These results illustrate the extraordinary conservation of HLA class II effects in narcolepsy across populations and show that DRB1*15:01 has no effect on narcolepsy susceptibility in the absence of DQB1*06:02. The results are also in line with a previously proposed 'HLA-DQ allelic competition model' that involves competition between non-DQA1*01:02, non-DQB1*06:02 'competent' (able to dimerize together) DQ1 alleles and the major DQα*01:02/ DQβ*06:02 narcolepsy heterodimer to reduce susceptibility. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

43749089720	Effects of gamma-secretase inhibitor N-(3,5-difiuorophenacetyi-L-alanyl)- S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester on proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells	Objective: To investigate the role of N-[ N-(3, 5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl) -S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), a gamma-secretases inhibitor, on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Methods: NSCs were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat brain, cultured, and treated with DAPT for 6 weeks. Cell counting was conducted every 24 h. CCK8 assay was used to draw the growth curve. Immunofluoresence staining was performed to observe the proportions of β-tubulin III positive cells (neurons), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells (astrocytes), and 2′, 3′-cyclic nucleotide3′ phosphohydrolase (CNPase) positive cells (oligodentrocytes). RT-PCR was employed to assay the mRNA expression of RBP-Jk and Hes1 genes, downstream genes of the Notch pathway. Results: Cell counting and CCK-8 assay showed that DAPT reduced the rate of NSC proliferation. Addition of DAPT altered NSC differentiation in vitro, percentage of The proportions neurons of the DAPT group was (13.84 ± 1.22)%, significantly higher than that of the control group [(3.7 ± 1.04)%, P < 0.01],the proportion of the oligodendrocytes of the DAPT group was (14.75 ± 1.58)%, significantly higher than that pf the control group [(4.8 ± 1.22)%, P < 0.01]. However, the proportion of astrocytes of the DAPT group was (63.41 ± 1.20)%, significantly lower than that of the control group [(82.84 ± 3.68)%, P < 0.01]. The expression levels of RBP-Jk and Hes1 mRNA (RBP-Jk/GAPDH and Hes1/GAPDH) in the NSC treated with DAPT were 0.52 ± 0.13 and 0.66 ± 0.18 respectively, both significantly lower than those of the control group (0.28 ± 0.06 and 0.16 ± 0.08 respectively, both P < 0.05). Conclusion: DAPT inhibits the NSC proliferation and alters the NSC committed differentiation. These effects are mediated via Notch signaling down regulation as a result of the inhibition of gamma-secretase.

46449123936	Synthesis of low polymerization degree paraformaldehyde under microwave irradiation	Synthesis of low polymerization degree paraformaldehyde (PF) under microwave irradiation was studied. Effects of microwave irradiation power, time and promoter on yield of PF were investigated. Microwave irradiation remarkably accelerates reaction and shortens reaction time. Formaldehyde content in PF and yield of PF reach 95.71% and 74.67% respectively. The average polymerization degree of PF is below 20 under microwave power 300 W, material superficial temperature 52°C, reaction time 25 min and mass fraction of dimethylamine as promoter 0.04%. A mathematical model of relationship of formaldehyde content in PF, yield of PF and microwave irradiation technological parameters were established by means of binary regression. Calculated values are well fitted with observed and average relative deviations of formaldehyde content and PF yield can reach 1.38% and 4.01%.

A mathematical model of the relation between mass fraction of formaldehyde, yield of formaldehyde and the technological parameters was established by means of the quadratic regression combination design process. The estimated value is well fitted with the observed value, and the average relative deviations are all less than 3.44%. The results show that the contribution of three factors to formaldehyde mass fraction of PF is air linear velocity, reaction temperature and reaction time in turn, and the contribution of three factors to yield of formaldehyde of PF is reaction temperature, reaction time and air linear velocity in turn. With these optimal conditions, the mass fraction and yield of formaldehyde of PF are 95% and 60%-70%, respectively.

52649144884	TGF-α induces upregulation and nuclear translocation of Hes1 in glioma cell	Both the Notch-signaling pathway and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) cascade are involved in a wide variety of biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, survival, and tumorigenesis. Their dysregulation in recent studies have been shown to be associated with glioma formation. Here, we show that transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) stimulated glioma cell line U251 growth and can partly compensate for the inhibitory effect of Notch-signaling inhibitor DAPT. The effect of TGF-α on ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prompt and transient and could be inhibited by mitogen-activated/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) specific inhibitor PD98059. Moreover, TGF-α was capable of up-regulating Hairy-enhancer of split1 (Hes1) expression which was independent of Notch1 activation, and of introducing Hes1 nuclear import in the presence of ERK1/2 activation. Collectively, our data suggest a potential linkage between ERK activation and the Notch-signaling pathway. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

66149115909	Hypoxia during pregnancy in rats leads to early morphological changes of atherosclerosis in adult offspring	Exposure to an adverse intrauterine environment increases the risk of cardiovascular disease later in adult life. However, the time course relationship between prenatal hypoxia and the onset of atherosclerosis in offspring remains unknown. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of reduced fetal oxygen supply on early development of atherogenesis in the adult offspring and further assess its susceptibility to sex-, hyperlipidemia-, and postnatal hypoxemia-related differences. Based on a 4 X 2 full factorial design consisting of four factors of maternal hypoxia, sex, hyperlipidemia, and postnatal hypoxemia, characteristics of growth were determined, and histopathological observation and morphometric analysis of the thoracic aortas were performed in Sprague-Dawley rat offspring. Intrauterine growth restriction, altered body shape at birth, and accelerated postnatal weight gain occurred in the maternal hypoxia group but did not occur in the control group. In 16-mo-old maternal hypoxia offspring, the thoracic aortas exhibited lesions similar to early events in atherosclerosis that involved impaired endothelial cells, thickening and fibration of intimas, infiltration of inflammatory cells to the subendothelial space, and migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells to the intima. In contrast, no detectable pathological changes were observed in the offspring without maternal hypoxia exposure. Morphometric analysis further demonstrated that prenatal hypoxia caused a significant thickening of intima (P < 0.001) with a main effect of 5.5 μm, an approximately twofold increase compared with controls. In addition, there was a positive additive relationship between prenatal hypoxia and hyperlipidemia on the intimal thickness (P < 0.05). There were no other main effects or interaction among these four factors. In summary, our results indicate that maternal hypoxia during pregnancy leads to early pathological appearances of atherogenesis in adult offspring. This effect was enhanced with hyperlipemia but was unaffected by postnatal hypoxia or sex. Copyright © 2009 the American Physiological Society.

69749107383	Effects of electro-acupuncture on Noxa and caspase-3 expression in hippocampal CA1 region of a vascular dementia rat model	Background: Noxa, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, has been shown to induce the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and to mediate hypoxic cell death in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. This suggests that Noxa could participate in apoptosis during vascular dementia (VD). Objective: To detect Noxa and caspase-3 expression after electro-acupuncture in VD rats to further validate the mechanism of electro-acupuncture-induced effects in the treatment of VD. Design, time and setting: A randomized, controlled study was performed at the Center for the Neurobiology of Fujian Medical University between January 2006 and Match 2007. Materials: A total of forty adult, male, Sprague Dawley rats were included in this study. The following equipment was used: confocal laser scanning microscope (Sp5, Leica, Germany), water maze (Bejing Suntendy Science and Technology Co., Ltd., China), and SDZ-II electronic acupuncture treatment instruments (Suzhou Medical Appliance Factory, China). Methods: Thirty-eight rats with sufficient learning and memory abilities were selected by Morris water maze criteria. Twelve rats received sham-surgery; the remaining 26 rats were used to establish a VD model by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries. The rats that survived the occlusion procedure were randomly assigned into an electro-acupuncture group (n = 11) and a VD model group (n = 12). Main outcome measures: Neuropathological changes were observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining of the hippocampus and expression of Noxa and caspase-3 in the hippocampal CA1 region was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope following immunofluorescence staining. Results: Expressions of Noxa and caspase-3 in the electro-acupuncture group and sham-operated group were less than in the VD model group (P < 0.01). Electro-acupuncture reduced the amount of apoptotic neurons in hippocampal CA1 area of rats with VD. The average latency in the Morris water maze test was significantly shorter, and escape strategies improved from edge and random searches to more linear swim pathways in the electro-acupuncture group compared with the VD model group (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Electro-acupuncture can improve learning and memory ability and inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis by blocking expression of Noxa and caspase-3 in the hippocampal CA1 region of VD rats.

Firstly, polyethyleneimine(PEI) was grafted covalently on PCMS surface in dimethyl formamide solvent to synthesize PEI/PCMS resin. Subsequently, polyquaternary amine resin (QPEI/PCMS) was prepared through quaternization of PEI/PCMS resin with 1-bromododecane and 1-butyl bromide in isopropanol solvent, on whose surface there was quaternary ammonium salt with high concentration. Morphology and chemical composition of the QPEI/PCMS resin surface were characterized by means of SEM and XPS. Bactericidal effect of the QPEI/PCMS resin on heterotrophic bacteria was demonstrated by packed column method. Count of viable cell in heterotrophic bacteria was carried out by plate count method. QPEI/PCMS resin was good in bactericidal activity. Renewable bactericidal activity of QPEI/PCMS resin was also demonstrated through reusing the resin without any significant loss of the bactericidal activity.

77950797954	Akt-mTOR signaling is involved in Notch-1-mediated glioma cell survival and proliferation	Both Notch signaling and Akt-mTOR signaling pathway are involved in glioma cell proliferation and survival. Previous studies have shown that Notch-1 is overexpressed in many glioma cell lines and primary human gliomas. Blocking of Notch signaling pathway can induces glioma cell apoptosis and growth suppression. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear. We report that activation of the Notch pathway by intracellular domain of human Notch-1 (NIC-1) strongly activates Akt and promotes U251 glioma cell proliferation. Knockdown of Notch-1 by RNA interference suppresses Akt activation, reduces glioma cell growth rate and induce cell apoptosis. Following Notch-1 suppression, phosphorylated Akt and its downstream effector mTOR were reduced. Knockdown of Notch-1 also involves down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, in parallel with activation of apoptotic associate proteins PARP, caspase-9 and caspase-3. Our data demonstrate that Notch-1 can positively regulate Akt-mTOR pathways, which is associated with glioma cell proliferation and apoptosis. This also suggests a molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effect of Notch-1 RNA interference on glioma cell proliferation through Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

77952543297	Immunoregulation of autocrine prolactin: Suppressing the expression of costimulatory molecules and cytokines in T lymphocytes by prolactin receptor knockdown	Ample evidence indicates that prolactin (PRL) secreted from the pituitary gland plays an important role in a variety of human immune responses. However, the immunoregulation of autocrine PRL in T lymphocytes is not fully understood. To evaluate the role of autocrine PRL in T lymphocyte activation, PRL receptor (PRLR) in Jurkat cells was silenced by lentivirus-mediated stable expression of PRLR shRNAi. Knockdown of PRLR resulted in a considerable reduction of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced T cell proliferation. Moreover, the synthesis and secretion of CD137, CD154, IL-2 and IL-4 were significantly decreased, while the production of CD28, IFN-γ and IL-10 was not affected in PHA-primed PRLR-deficient cells. These results demonstrate the importance of autocrine regulation of the PRL signaling in T lymphocyte growth and activation, and support a mechanism by which autocrine PRL participates in the immunoregulation through selectively influencing the expression of certain critical costimulatory molecules and cytokines. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77953316929	Thermal-responsive hydrogel surface: Tunable wettability and adhesion to oil at the water/solid interface	We present a thermal-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel, which can responsively and reversibly control the wettability and adhesion to oil at water/solid interface. The hydrogel surface can switch from a superoleophobic and low adhesive state below the PNIPAM lower critical solution temperature (LCST, ∼32 °C) to an oleophobic and high adhesive state above its LCST. Moreover, the thermal-responsive wettability and adhesion to oil at the water/solid interface can be tailored by designing and constructing ordered micro-structures on the surface. We demonstrated the thermal-responsive changing of the topography on PNIPAM hydrogel surface by atomic force microscopy and proposed a mechanism of inter-molecular to intra-molecular hydrogen binding transitions. We believe the reported material has promising utilizations in micro fluidics, control of bio-relevant adhesion and under-water antifouling materials. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

77956118283	Epidemiologic study of soft tissue rheumatism in Shantou and Taiyuan, China	Background: Soft tissue rheumatism is a group of common rheumatic disorders reported in many countries. For investigating the prevalence rate of soft tissue rheumatism in different population in China, we carried out a population study in Shantou rural and Taiyuan urban area. Methods: Samples of 3915 adults in an urban area of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, and 2350 in a rural area of Shantou, Guangdong Province were surveyed. Modified International League of Association for Rheumatology (ILAR)-Asia Pacific League of Association for Rheumatology (APLAR) Community Oriented Program for Control of Rheumatic Diseases (COPCORD) core questionnaire was implemented as screening tool. The positive responders were then all examined by rheumatologists. Results: Prevalence rate of soft tissue rheumatism was 2.0% in Taiyuan, and 5.3% in Shantou. Rotator cuff (shoulder) tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow), and digital flexor tenosynovitis (trigger finger) were the commonly seen soft tissue rheumatism in both areas. Tatarsalgia, plantar fasciitis, and De Quervain's tenosynovitis were more commonly seen in Shantou than that in Taiyuan. Only 1 case of fibromyalgia was found in Taiyuan and 2 cases in Shantou. The prevalence of soft tissue rheumatism varied with age, sex and occupation. Conclusions: Soft tissue rheumatism is common in Taiyuan and Shantou, China. The prevalence of soft tissue rheumatism was quite different with different geographic, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions; and varying with age, sex, and occupation. The prevalence of fibromyalgia is low in the present survey.

78651380826	Intracellular iodinated compounds affect sodium iodide symporter expression through TSH-mediated signaling pathways	The mechanisms by which thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) regulates the expression and activity of sodium iodide symporter (NIS) through cAMP-PKA have been partially elucidated by many studies. However, the effects of the TSH-mediated PLC-IP3 signaling pathway on the expression of NIS and how intracellular iodinated compounds interfere with these signaling pathways are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of the TSH-mediated cAMP-PKA and PLC-IP3 pathways on the expression of NIS in the presence of various intracellular iodinated compounds. The intracellular iodinated compounds were formed by treating cells with different concentrations of iodine with or without methimazole (MMI), an inhibitor of iodine organification, in a pig monolayer thyrocyte in vitro. A high concentration of iodine increased NIS expression at the mRNA and protein levels; however, this phenomenon was not observed in the presence of MMI. Both the cAMP-PKA and PLC-IP3 signaling pathways inhibited the expression of NIS at low iodine concentrations; however, in thyrocytes treated with high concentrations of iodine, the effect of cAMP-PKA on the expression of NIS changed from inhibition to promotion, while the PLC-IP3 pathway continued to inhibit NIS expression. These findings indicate that intracellular iodinated compounds affect NIS expression through the TSH-mediated cAMP-PKA and PLC-IP3 pathways.

78650932738	Improving the diagnostic method for the SLC25A13 gene 851del4 mutation and analysis of the common mutation frequencies in Quanzhou area	Objective: To ascertain whether the carrier rate is high in Quanzhou which is next to Taiwan in South of the Yangtze River. Methods Population analysis of three SLC25A13 mutations, i. e. 851del4, 1638-1660dup, and IVS6 + 5G>A was carried out in 450 healthy individuals. DNA diagnostic method of 851del4 was improved by using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) with restriction enzyme HpyCH4IV, and the results were confirmed by GeneScan method. Results: Six carriers with 851del4, 3 with 1638-1660dup and 3 with IVS6+5G>A was found. Conclusion: The high carrier rate (0.027,12/450) obtained from testing of only three mutations indicated that there must be a certain number of patients with citrin deficiency in Quanzhou, even in Fujian. Therefore, it is important for physicians in Quanzhou, Fujian Province to learn about citrin deficiency, and to diagnose and treat the patients correctly.

78651245467	Common variants in P2RY11 are associated with narcolepsy	Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that narcolepsy with cataplexy is an autoimmune disease. We here report genome-wide association analyses for narcolepsy with replication and fine mapping across three ethnic groups (3,406 individuals of European ancestry, 2,414 Asians and 302 African Americans). We identify a SNP in the 3ĝ€2 untranslated region of P2RY11, the purinergic receptor subtype P2Y 11 gene, which is associated with narcolepsy (rs2305795, combined P = 6.1 - 10 '10, odds ratio = 1.28, 95% CI 1.19ĝ€"1.39, n = 5689). The disease-associated allele is correlated with reduced expression of P2RY11 in CD8 + T lymphocytes (339% reduced, P = 0.003) and natural killer (NK) cells (P = 0.031), but not in other peripheral blood mononuclear cell types. The low expression variant is also associated with reduced P2RY11-mediated resistance to ATP-induced cell death in T lymphocytes (P = 0.0007) and natural killer cells (P = 0.001). These results identify P2RY11 as an important regulator of immune-cell survival, with possible implications in narcolepsy and other autoimmune diseases. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

79951784323	Inhibition of thyroid-restricted genes by follicular thyroglobulin involves iodinated degree	Follicular thyroglobulin (TG) reflects the storage of both iodine and thyroid hormone. This is because it is a macromolecular precursor of thyroid hormone and organic iodinated compound in follicular lumen. Thus, it may have an important feedback role in thyroid function. In this study, monolayer cells were cultured and follicles were reconstituted with primary pig thyroid cells in vitro. Reconstituted follicles were treated with iodine and methimazole (MMI), a drug that blocks iodine organification and reduces the degree of TG iodination in follicular lumen. The high degree of iodinated TG in follicular lumen was observed to inhibit thyroid-restricted gene expression. To confirm this finding, monolayer thyroid cells were treated with a different degree of TG iodination at the same concentration. These iodinated TG were extracted from reconstituted follicles of different groups. In this manner, this study provides firsthand evidence suggesting that follicular TG inhibits the expressions of thyroid-restricted genes NIS, TPO, TG, and TSHr. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79953747613	CCL18 from Tumor-Associated Macrophages Promotes Breast Cancer Metastasis via PITPNM3	Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can influence cancer progression and metastasis, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that breast TAMs abundantly produce CCL18, and its expression in blood or cancer stroma is associated with metastasis and reduced patient survival. CCL18 released by breast TAMs promotes the invasiveness of cancer cells by triggering integrin clustering and enhancing their adherence to extracellular matrix. Furthermore, we identify PITPNM3 as a functional receptor for CCL18 that mediates CCL18 effect and activates intracellular calcium signaling. CCL18 promotes the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer xenografts, whereas suppressing PITPNM3 abrogates these effects. These findings indicate that CCL18 derived from TAMs plays a critical role in promoting breast cancer metastasis via its receptor, PITPNM3. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79955540746	Upregulation of thyroid transcription factor-1 and human leukocyte antigen class I in Hashimoto's disease providing a clinical evidence for possible triggering autoimmune reaction	Objective: An increase in the expression of autoantigens and their presenting molecules human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I has been demonstrated to be responsible for autoimmune diseases. Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1 or NKX2-1) synchronously upregulates both HLA class I and thyroid-specific autoantigen, which may be involved in the pathological process of autoimmune thyroiditis. In this study, the expressions and potential role of TTF-1 and HLA class I in Hashimoto's disease (HT) were examined. Patients: In this study, 22 resection specimens clinically and histopathologically confirmed to have Hashimoto's disease and 30 normal thyroid specimens from adjacent tissues of thyroid adenoma were used. Measurement: Western blot, real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to assay TTF-1 and HLA class I in the thyrocytes of Hashimoto's disease as well as in the normal thyroid from adjacent tissues of thyroid adenoma. Results: The TTF-1 and HLA class I in Hashimoto's disease were significantly higher than those in the controls. Conclusion: Upregulation of TTF-1 and HLA class I in Hashimoto's disease provide a clinical evidence for possible triggering of autoimmune reaction. © 2011 European Society of Endocrinology.

79960227178	Rapid screening for 61 central nervous system drugs in plasma using weak cation exchange solid-phase extraction and high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection	Rapid and accurate screening for toxicants/chemicals in a broad range is an important element in systematic toxicological analysis (STA). Herein, we report a novel method for the rapid screening of 61 central nervous system (CNS) drugs in plasma, using a solid-phase extraction (SPE) column termed, weak cation exchange (WCX) and high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The SPE column was preconditioned sequentially with 3 ml of acetonitrile, 1 ml of water and, 2 ml of buffer solution. The pretreated plasma was loaded onto the column, which was then washed with 2 ml of water, followed by 2 ml of acetonitrile, and the acetonitrile elution was collected as the neutral/acid fraction. Subsequently, 3 ml of trifluoroacetic acid-acetonitrile (2+98) was then used to elute the column and the elution was collected as basic fraction. The collected fractions were evaporated at 60°C under a nitrogen stream until about 100 μl of solvent remained. The final volume was then adjusted to 1 ml with 5% of acetonitrile. The HPLC separation was accomplished on an Agilent TC-C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer solution as mobile phase, by gradient elution at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The detection wavelength was 210 nm, and the full spectra were recorded from 200 to 364 nm. The absolute recoveries of 55 drugs tested, exceeded 50%; 42 of them exceeded 80%. In conclusion, the WCX SPE preparation combined with HPLC-DAD, is suitable for a broad drug screening for CNS drugs. © 2011 Academic Journals.

84855399564	HGF-induced PKCζ activation increases functional CXCR4 expression in human breast cancer cells	The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 have been shown to mediate the metastasis of many malignant tumors including breast carcinoma. Interaction between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the Met receptor tyrosine kinase mediates development and progression of cancers. HGF is able to induce CXCR4 expression and contributes to tumor cell invasiveness in breast carcinoma. However, the mechanism of the CXCR4 expression modulated by c-Met-HGF axis to enhance the metastatic behavior of breast cancer cells is still unclear. In this study, we found that HGF induced functional CXCR4 receptor expression in breast cancer cells. The effect of HGF was specifically mediated by PKCζ activity. After transfection with PKCζ-siRNA, the phosphorylation of PKCζ and CXCR4 was abrogated in breast cancer cells. Interference with the activation of Rac1, a downstream target of HGF, prevented the HGF-induced increase in PKCζ activity and CXCR4 levels. The HGF-induced, LY294002-sensitive translocation of PKCζ from cytosol to plasma membrane indicated that HGF was capable of activating PKCζ, probably via phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinases. HGF treatment also increased MT1-MMP secretion. Inhibition of PKCζ, Rac-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may attenuate MT1-MMP expression in cells exposed to HGF. Functional manifestation of the effects of HGF revealed an increased ability for migration, chemotaxis and metastasis in MDA-MB-436 cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings thus provided evidence that the process of HGF-induced functional CXCR4 expression may involve PI 3-kinase and atypical PKCζ. Moreover, HGF may promote the invasiveness and metastasis of breast tumor xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice via the PKCζ-mediated pathway, while suppression of PKCζ by RNA interference may abrogate cancer cell spreading. © 2012 Huang et al.

84857236031	TCRA, P2RY11, and CPT1B/CHKB associations in Chinese narcolepsy	Objectives: Polymorphisms in the TCRA and P2RY11, two immune related genes, are associated with narcolepsy in Caucasians and Asians. In contrast, CPT1B/. CHKB polymorphisms have only been shown to be associated with narcolepsy in Japanese, with replication in a small group of Koreans. Our aim was to study whether these polymorphisms are associated with narcolepsy and its clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with narcolepsy. Methods: We collected clinical data on 510 Chinese patients presenting with narcolepsy/hypocretin deficiency. Patients were included either when hypocretin deficiency was documented (CSF hypocretin-1 ≤ 110 pg/ml, n= 91) or on the basis of the presence of clear cataplexy and HLA-DQB1*0602 positivity (n= 419). Genetic data was compared to typing obtained in 452 controls matched for geographic origin within China. Clinical evaluations included demographics, the Stanford Sleep Inventory (presence and age of onset of each symptom), and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) data. Results: Chinese narcolepsy was strongly and dose dependently associated with TCRA (rs1154155C) and P2RY11 (rs2305795A) but not CPT1B/. CHKB (rs5770917C) polymorphisms. CPT1B/. CHKB polymorphisms were not associated with any specific clinical characteristics. TCRA rs1154155A homozygotes (58 subjects) had a later disease onset, but this was not significant when corrected for multiple comparisons, thus replication is needed. CPT1B/. CHKB or P2RY11 polymorphisms were not associated with any specific clinical characteristics. Conclusions: The study extends on the observation of a strong multiethnic association of polymorphisms in the TCRA and P2RY11 with narcolepsy, but does not confirm the association of CPT1B/. CHKB (rs5770917) in the Chinese population. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84856222156	MiR-200b and miR-15b regulate chemotherapy-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human tongue cancer cells by targeting BMI1	Chemotherapy has been reported to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells, which is a critical step in the process of metastasis leading to cancer spreading and treatment failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced EMT remain unclear, and the involvement of microRNAs (miRNA) in this process is poorly understood. To address these questions, we established stable chemotherapy-resistant tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) cell lines CAL27-res and SCC25-res by exposing the parental CAL27 and SCC25 lines to escalating concentrations of cisplatin for 6 months. CAL27-res and SCC25-res cells displayed mesenchymal features with enhanced invasiveness and motility. MiRNA microarray illustrated that miR-200b and miR-15b were the most significantly downregulated microRNAs in CAL27-res cells. Ectopic expression of miR-200b and miR-15b with miRNA mimics effectively reversed the phenotype of EMT in CAL27-res and SCC25-res cells, and sensitized them to chemotherapy, but inhibition of miR-200b and miR-15b in the sensitive lines with anti-sense oligonucleotides induced EMT and conferred chemoresistance. Retrieving the expression of B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1), a target for miR-200b and miR-15b, in the presence of the miRNA mimics by transfecting CAL27-res cells with pcDNA3.1-BMI1-carrying mutated seed sequences of miR-200b or miR-15b at its 3′-UTR recapitulated chemotherapy-induced EMT. In vivo, enforced miR-200b or miR-15b expression suppressed metastasis of TSCC xenografts established by CAL27-res cells. Clinically, reduced miR-200b or miR-15b expression was associated with chemotherapeutic resistance in TSCCs and poor patient survival. Our data suggest that reduced expression of miR-200b and miR-15b underscores the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced EMT in TSCC, and may serve as therapeutic targets to reverse chemotherapy resistance in tongue cancers. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84860390294	Narcolepsy onset is seasonal and increased following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in china	Objective: Narcolepsy is caused by the loss of hypocretin/orexin neurons in the hypothalamus, which is likely the result of an autoimmune process. Recently, concern has been raised over reports of narcolepsy in northern Europe following H1N1 vaccination. Methods: The study is a retrospective analysis of narcolepsy onset in subjects diagnosed in Beijing, China (1998-2010). Self-reported month and year of onset were collected from 629 patients (86% children). Graphical presentation, autocorrelations, chi-square, and Fourier analysis were used to assess monthly variation in onset. Finally, 182 patients having developed narcolepsy after October 2009 were asked for vaccination history. Results: The occurrence of narcolepsy onset was seasonal, significantly influenced by month and calendar year. Onset was least frequent in November and most frequent in April, with a 6.7-fold increase from trough to peak. Studying year-to-year variation, we found a 3-fold increase in narcolepsy onset following the 2009 H1N1 winter influenza pandemic. The increase is unlikely to be explained by increased vaccination, as only 8 of 142 (5.6%) patients recalled receiving an H1N1 vaccination. Cross-correlation indicated a significant 5- to 7-month delay between the seasonal peak in influenza/cold or H1N1 infections and peak in narcolepsy onset occurrences. Interpretation: In China, narcolepsy onset is highly correlated with seasonal and annual patterns of upper airway infections, including H1N1 influenza. In 2010, the peak seasonal onset of narcolepsy was phase delayed by 6 months relative to winter H1N1 infections, and the correlation was independent of H1N1 vaccination in the majority of the sample. © 2011 American Neurological Association.

84862657908	Multiscale bio-inspired honeycomb structure material with high mechanical strength and low density	We report a kind of polymer ordered porous honeycomb structure film with enhanced mechanical strength and low density. The film is fabricated with polyimide as a basic structure and nano-clay as the enhanced layer in the honeycomb walls, which mimics the multi-scale structure of natural honeycombs. After examining the mechanical properties of the bio-inspired honeycomb structures with different contents of clay, we find that the hardness of the honeycomb films increases with increasing clay content, and reaches a maximum value of 0.037GPa on average, which is about 5 times that for the honeycomb film without clay. Because of the existence of the porous structure, the bulk density of the multiscale bio-inspired honeycomb structure films fabricated with the solution containing 0.9 wt% clay content is 35.7% of the honeycomb structure films fabricated with the solution without clay, and the apparent density of the honeycomb structure films fabricated with the solution containing 0.9 wt% clay content is 67.5% of the honeycomb structure films fabricated with the solution without clay, and the porosity increases by 45.6%. In addition, the study of the thermal properties indicates that the porous structure does not decrease the thermal stability of the original materials. Meanwhile, the introduction of the clay into the film can increase the thermal stability of the materials slightly. So this kind of multiscale bio-inspired honeycomb structure, with high mechanical strength, low density and excellent thermal stability, is considered to have wide applications in the areas of tissue engineering, aeronautical materials, separation films in lithium-ion batteries, and so on. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

84862835849	Bioinspired oil strider floating at the oil/water interface supported by huge superoleophobic force	Oil pollution to aquatic devices, especially to those oil-cleaning devices and equipment-repairing robots during oil spill accidents, has drawn great attention and remains an urgent problem to be resolved. Developing devices that can move freely in an oil/water system without contamination from oil has both scientific and practical importance. In nature, the insect water strider can float on water by utilizing the superhydrophobic supporting force received by its legs. Inspired by this unique floating phenomenon, in this article, we designed a model device named "oil strider" that could float stably at the oil/water interface without contamination by oil. The floating capability of the oil strider originated from the huge underwater superoleophobic supporting force its "legs" received. We prepared the micro/nanohierarchical structured copper-oxide-coated copper wires, acting as the artificial legs of oil strider, by a simple base-corrosion process. The surface structures and hydrophilic chemical components of the coatings on copper wires induced the huge superoleophobic force at the oil/water interface, to support the oil strider from sinking into the oil. Experimental results and theoretical analysis demonstrate that this supporting force is mainly composed of three parts: the buoyancy force, the curvature force, and the deformation force. We anticipate that this artificial oil strider will provide a guide for the design of smart aquatic devices that can move freely in an oil/water system with excellent oil repellent capability, and be helpful in practical situations such as oil handling and oil spill cleanup. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84862865903	Contralateral retinal dopamine decrease and melatonin increase in progression of hemiparkinsonium rat	Both dopamine (DA) and melatonin (MLT) are abundant neuromodulators located in vertebrate retina. The retinal DA deficiency and variations in MLT levels have been linked to Parkinson's disease (PD). No studies have investigated the ipsilateral and contralateral DA and MLT in retina and their relationships in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced hemiparkinsonian rats. We established PD rat model by unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the right substantia nigra and the right medial forebrain bundle. Eye tissue was collected and the levels of MLT and DA were measured twice daily at 10:00 and 22:00. The concentrations of DA and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), as well as MLT were determined by HPLC. The results show that DA levels in the eye contralateral to the side of a unilateral intracerebral 6-OHDA lesion significantly decreased (P<0.001). Both the ratios of DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA were increased in comparison with the vehicle groups after 3 weeks post-lesion. The concentrations of MLT at 10:00 and 22:00 in both eyes were distinctly increased compared with the vehicle groups (P<0.05). The change of DA and its metabolites, as well as MLT appeared to correlate well with the rotation behavior of rats. These findings suggest that rats receive a unilateral intracerebral injection of 6-OHDA that mainly causes the contralateral eye destruction of DA-containing neurons. Increased retinal MLT level probably is associated with the progression of PD. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84873729161	Increased melatonin may play dual roles in the striata of a 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease	Aims To investigate dynamic changes and roles of melatonin (MLT) in the striata of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-treated rats. Main methods A Parkinson's disease (PD) rat was established by a unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the right substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the right medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to achieve a complete lesion of the ipsilateral nigrostriatal DA system. Dialysates were collected in the lesioned striatum at different time intervals by in vivo microdialysis. In addition, both contralateral and ipsilateral striatum tissues were collected at two time intervals (10:00 and 22:00 h) at 3 and 6 weeks after lesioning. The levels of DA, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the dialysates, as well as MLT in the dialysates and tissues were determined using HPLC. Key findings The dialysate contents of DA, DOPAC and HVA in the lesioned striatum were significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in comparison with those in the controls or in the unlesioned side 3 weeks after lesioning while the extracellular level of MLT in the lesioned striatum in these corresponding time intervals distinctly increased when compared with those in the controls (P < 0.05). The tissue MLT contents increased in the bilateral striata in different degrees at 6 weeks post-lesion (P < 0.05). Moreover, increased MLT levels correlate well with rotations or DA changes in the lesioned striatum. Significance These data suggest that 6-OHDA lesion manipulates the MLT secretion pattern. Increased striatal MLT level by a unilateral intracerebral injection of 6-OHDA may play dual roles in the progression of PD in rats. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84879860696	Understanding the relationship of performance with nanofiller content in the biomimetic layered nanocomposites	Montmorillonite/poly(vinyl alcohol) (MMT/PVA) nanocomposites spanning the complete range of MMT content (0-100 wt%) are prepared by simple evaporation-induced assembly. Effects of MMT content on the structure and mechanical properties of nanocomposites are systematically investigated and exhibit two important transitions at MMT contents of 30 wt% and 70 wt%. In the range of 0-30 wt%, the nanocomposites show a random structure. With the content of PVA increasing, the mechanical properties of the resultant nanocomposites were dramatically enhanced and were higher than that by prediction according to the conventional composite model. In the range of 30-70 wt%, the nanocomposites show a nacre-like layered structure with alternating MMT platelets and PVA layers, and all PVA is completely restricted by MMT platelets. The mechanical properties of nanocomposites were further improved by increasing the content of MMT, and reached the maximum value at the MMT content of 70 wt%. The 70 wt% MMT/PVA nanocomposite has a tensile strength of 219 ± 19 MPa, which is 5.5 times higher than that of a pure PVA film and surpasses nacre and reported biomimetic layered clay/PVA composites. When the MMT content is higher than 70 wt%, the layered structure is transformed to tactoids, which deteriorate mechanical properties.

84884336581	Highly dispersed platinum nanoparticles generated in viologen micelles with high catalytic activity and stability	Metal particles dispersed on supports are important to improve the catalytic activity of metals. Herein, ultrasmall platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) immobilized in viologen micelles have been prepared by reducing chloroplatinic acid with DMF in the presence of a viologen-based surfactant, which not only acts as the nucleation site of metal particle formation, but also is responsible for protecting the Pt NPs from further growth or aggregation. The viologen-templated Pt NPs remain stable for several months without any noticeable aggregation. The obtained Pt NPs-viologen micelles show higher catalytic activity and stability in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol by NaBH

84886432544	Reduction of Decoy Receptor 3 Enhances TRAIL-Mediated Apoptosis in Pancreatic Cancer	Most human pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells utilize their extracellular molecules to counteract the proapoptotic signaling mediated by the TNF family are largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that DcR3, a secreted decoy receptor that malignant pancreatic cancer cells express at a high level, acts as an extracellular antiapoptotic molecule by binding to TRAIL and counteracting its death-promoting function. The reduction of DcR3 with siRNA unmasked TRAIL and greatly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Gemcitabine, a first-line drug for pancreatic cancer, also reduced the level of DcR3. The addition of DcR3 siRNA further enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Notably, our in vivo study demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of gemcitabine could be enhanced via further reduction of DcR3, suggesting that downregulation of DcR3 in tumor cells could tip the balance of pancreatic cells towards apoptosis and potentially serve as a new strategy for pancreatic cancer therapy. © 2013 Wang et al.

84892732718	The utilization of drug-polymer interactions for improving the chemical stability of hot-melt extruded solid dispersions	Objective Interactions between drugs and polymers were utilized to lower the processing temperature of hot-melt extrusion (HME), and thus minimize the thermal degradation of heat-sensitive drugs during preparation of amorphous solid dispersions. Methods Diflunisal (DIF), which would degrade upon melting, was selected as a model drug. Hydrogen bonds between DIF and polymeric carriers (PVP K30, PVP VA64, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and Soluplus) were revealed by differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The hot-melt extruded solid dispersion was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Key findings The results of hot-stage polar microscopy indicated that DIF was dissolved in molten polymers at 160°C, much lower than the melting point of DIF (215°C). At this temperature, amorphous solid dispersions were successfully produced by HME, as confirmed by XRD and SEM. The related impurities in amorphous solid dispersions detected by HPLC were lower than 0.3%, indicating that thermal degradation was effectively minimized. The dissolution of DIF from amorphous solid dispersions was significantly enhanced as compared with the pure crystalline drug. Conclusion This technique based on drug-polymer interactions to prepare chemically stable amorphous solid dispersions by HME provides an attractive opportunity for development of heat-sensitive drugs. © 2013 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

84892749363	Interactions between drugs and polymers influencing hot melt extrusion	Objectives Hot melt extrusion (HME) as a technique for producing amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) has been widely used in pharmaceutical research. The biggest challenge for the application of HME is the thermal degradation of drug, poor physical stability of ASD and precipitation of drug during dissolution. Interactions between drugs and polymers may play an important role in overcoming these barriers. In this review, influence of drug-polymer interactions on HME and the methods for characterizing the drug-polymer interactions were reviewed. Key findings Strong drug-polymer interactions, especially ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds, are helpful to improving the thermal stability of drug during HME, enhancing the physical stability of ASD during storage and maintaining supersaturated solution after dissolution in gastrointestinal tract. The interactions can be quantitatively and qualitatively characterized by many analysing methods. Conclusions As many factors collectively determine the properties of HME products, drug-polymer interactions play an extremely important role. However, the action mechanisms of drug-polymer interactions need intensive investigation to provide more useful information for optimizing the formulation and the process parameters of HME. © 2013 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.

84892930043	Serum melatonin is an alternative index of Parkinson's disease severity	The protective potential of melatonin (MLT) in Parkinson's disease (PD) is the subject of considerable controversy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate serum MLT levels in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion rats and patients with PD. Blood samples were collected from rats at 10:00 am and from patients with PD and healthy subjects between 8:00 and 10:00 am. Serum MLT levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our results revealed that the morning serum MLT levels either in 6-OHDA-induced hemi-parkinsonian rats or patients with PD were significantly higher than that of control group. Our results also demonstrate that serum MLT levels are correlated with severity of PD according to H & Y scale. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84893848082	Filefish-inspired surface design for anisotropic underwater oleophobicity	Surfaces with anisotropic wettability, widely found in nature, have inspired the development of one-dimensional water control on surfaces relying on the well-arranged surface features. Controlling the wetting behavior of organic liquids, especially the motion of oil fluid on surfaces, is of great importance for a broad range of applications including oil transportation, oil-repellent coatings, and water/oil separation. However, anisotropic oil-wetting surfaces remain unexplored. Here, the unique skin of a filefish Navodon septentrionalis shows anisotropic oleophobicity under water. On the rough skin of N. septentrionalis, oil droplets tend to roll off in a head-to-tail direction, but pin in the opposite direction. This pronounced wetting anisotropy results from the oriented hook-like spines arrayed on the fish skin. It inspires further exploration of the artificial anisotropic underwater oleophobic surfaces: By mimicking the oriented hook-like microstructure on a polydimethylsiloxane layer via soft lithography and subsequent oxygen-plasma treatment to make the PDMS hydrophilic, artificial fish skin is fabricated which has similar anisotropic underwater oleophobicity. Drawn from the processing of artificial fish skin, a simple principle is proposed to achieve anisotropic underwater oleophobicity by adjusting the hydrophilicity of surface composition and the anisotropic microtextures. This principle can guide the simple mass manufacturing of various inexpensive high surface-energy materials, and the principle is demonstrated on commercial cloth corduroy. This study will profit broad applications involving low-energy, low-expense oil transportation, underwater oil collection, and oil-repellant coatings on ship hulls and oil pipelines. Unique anisotropic underwater oleophobicity of the skin of filefish Navodon septentrionalis is revealed, which results from its oriented hook-like spines. Inspired by this, an anisotropic underwater oleophobic surface is fabricated on an oxygen plasma-treated PDMS layer. Anisotropic microfeatures on the surfaces and hydrophilicity are proposed as two main factors in achieving anisotropic underwater oleophobicity. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84894041872	Application of hot melt extrusion for poorly water-soluble drugs: Limitations, advances and future prospects	Hot melt extrusion (HME) is a powerful technology to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by producing amorphous solid dispersions. Although the number of articles and patents about HME increased dramatically in the past twenty years, there are very few commercial products by far. The three main obstacles limiting the commercial application of HME are summarized as thermal degradation of heat-sensitive drugs at high process temperature, recrystallization of amorphous drugs during storage and dissolving process, and difficulty to obtain products with reproducible physicochemical properties. Many efforts have been taken in recent years to understand the basic mechanism underlying these obstacles and then to overcome them. This article reviewed and summarized the limitations, recent advances, and future prospects of HME. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

84895786625	Decreased activated protein C levels are inversely associated with the urinary albumin excretion rate in patients with type 2 diabetes	Activated protein C (APC) plays a vital renoprotective role against diabetic nephropathy in STZ-induced diabetic mice by inhibiting endothelial cell and podocyte apoptosis. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the degree of albuminuria and APC levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: Ninety-four patients with type 2 diabetes and 38 healthy subjects were recruited into this study. The urinary albumin concentrations of urine collected over 24 hours were measured by ELISA to evaluate the mean urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER). The HbA1c levels were determined using an HPLC assay. Results: There was no significant difference in the APC levels between diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria and controls, although APC levels were significantly lower in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (23.06 ± 19.82 vs. 54.58 ± 53.63 pg/mL, p < 0.05) or macroalbuminuria (8.06 ± 10.09 vs. 54.58 ± 53.63 pg/mL, p < 0.05) as compared to control subjects. In addition, in comparison to diabetic patients with normoalbuminuria, APC levels were lower in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (23.06 ± 19.82 vs. 55.69 ± 31.98 pg/mL, p < 0.05) and they were the lowest in diabetic patients with macroalbuminuria (8.06 ± 10.09 vs. 55.69 ± 31.98 pg/mL, p < 0.05). Multivariate regression and ROC analysis found that the levels of APC and HbAlc were independent risk factors for UAER levels (R

84900335537	A Positive feedback loop between mesenchymal-like cancer cells and macrophages is essential to breast cancer metastasis	The close vicinity of cancer cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) at the invasive front of tumors suggests that these two cell type may mutually interact. We show that mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells activate macrophages to a TAM-like phenotype by GM-CSF. Reciprocally, CCL18 from TAMs induces cancer cell EMT, forming a positive feedback loop, in coculture systems and humanized mice. Inhibition of GM-CSF or CCL18 breaks this loop and reduces cancer metastasis. High GM-CSF expression in breast cancer samples is associated with more CCL18

84901229165	MiR-27a regulates endothelial differentiation of breast cancer stem like cells	Recent studies suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells and tumor endothelium may be derived from CSCs. But the mechanism remains unclear. We showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced the expression of endothelial markers in breast cancer stem like cells (BCSLCs). In addition, the VEGF-treated BCSLCs formed capillary structure in matrigel and released vWF upon histamine treatment. The miR-27a expression was significantly increased in VEGF-treated BCSLCs. Antagonizing miR-27a by miR-27a anti-sense oligos (ASOs) in VEGF-treated BCSLCs led to decreased endothelial markers and function, while increasing miR-27a in BCSLCs resulted in enhanced endothelial properties. VEGF enhanced the transcription of miR-27a by increasing RUNX1 binding to miR-27a promoter. Increased miR-27a paralleled the reduced expression of ZBTB10, a known miR-27a target. Both expression of miR-27a and knockdown of ZBTB10 in BCSLCs promoted in vivo angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Further, we demonstrated that VEGF-treated BCSLCs secreted more endogenous VEGF compared with undifferentiated BCSLCs. Thus, miR-27a promotes angiogenesis by mediating endothelial differentiation of BCSLCs and it may be a new target for anti-angiogenesis cancer therapy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84902549542	Hippocampal NR2B-containing NMDA receptors enhance long-term potentiation in rats with chronic visceral pain	Pain and learning memory have striking similarities in synaptic plasticity. Activation of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors 2B subunits (NR2B-NMDAs) is responsible for the hippocampal LTP in memory formation. In our previous studies, we found the significant enhancement of CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in rats with chronic visceral pain. However, it is unclear whether the NR2B-NMDAs are required for the LTP in chronic visceral pain. In this study, a rat model with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was established by colorectal distention (CRD). The sensitivity of visceral pain and HFS-induced LTP at SC-CA1 synapses were significantly enhanced in IBS-like rats (p<0.05). In addition, hippocampal NR2B protein levels significantly increased in IBS-like rats (p<0.05). To test whether NR2B-NMDAs are responsible for the LTP, effects of Ro 25-6981, a selective antagonist of NR2B-NMDAs, on field potential in CA1 region were investigated in vitro. Our results demonstrated that Ro 25-6981 dose-dependently inhibited the facilitation of CA1 LTP in IBS-like rats. The plausible activation mechanism of hippocampal NR2B-NMDAs in the LTP enhancement was further explored. Western blot data indicated that expression of tyrosine phosphorylated NR2B protein in hippocampus significantly enhanced in IBS-like rats. Accordingly, genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, dose-dependently blocked the facilitation of hippocampal LTP in IBS-like rats. Furthermore, EMG data revealed that intra-hippocampal injection of Ro 25-6981 dose-dependently attenuated the visceral hypersensitivity. In conclusion, hippocampal NR2B-NMDAs are responsible for the facilitation of CA1 LTP via tyrosine phosphorylation, which leads to visceral hypersensitivity. © 2014 The Authors.

84905575709	Apelin-13 decreases lipid storage in hypertrophic adipocytes in vitro through the upregulation of AQP7 expression by the PI3K signaling pathway	Background: Adipocyte-secreted apelin contributes to decreased adiposity and to improved insulin resistance, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The present study aimed to assess if apelin-13 is an upstream signal regulation factor of aquaporin 7 (AQP7), a water-glycerol transporter present in the plasma membrane of adipocytes that plays a key role in the regulation of lipid accumulation. Material/Methods: 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were induced to fully differentiated adipocytes; hypertrophic adipocytes were then induced using palmitate. The effects of apelin-13 on AQP7 expression in hypertrophic adipocytes were investigated before and after treatment with LY249002, a PI3K inhibitor. Accumulation of cytoplasmic triglycerides (TG) in hypertrophic adipocytes was also determined. Results: We found that 0.1 mM of palmitate induced a model of hypertrophic adipocytes with a lower AQP7 expression (0.26±0.07 vs.0.46±0.04, P<0.05). Apelin-13 100 nM or 1000 nM upregulated AQP7 mRNA expression (100 nM: 0.54±0.06 and 1000 nM: 0.58±0.09 vs.control: 0.33±0.04, both P<0.05), and decreased accumulation of cytoplasmic triglycerides in hypertrophic adipocytes. Pretreatment using 10 μM LY294002 prevented the increase in AQP7 expression observed when using apelin-13 alone (apelin-13 + LY49002: 0.38±0.03 vs.apelin-13: 0.54±0.06, P<0.05), as well as the decreased cytoplasmic TG accumulation (apelin-13 + LY294002: 3.79±0.04 μM per μg/ml vs.apelin-13: 3.32±0.08 μM per μg/ml, P<0.05). Conclusions: Apelin-13 decreases lipid storage in hypertrophic adipocytes in vitro, possibly through the upregulation of AQP7 expression by the PI3K signaling pathway. Treatment using apelin-13 and AQP modulators might represent novel treatment strategies against obesity and its related complications. © Med Sci Monit, 2014.

84905694039	Noble-metal-free Fe-N/C catalyst for highly efficient oxygen reduction reaction under both alkaline and acidic conditions	In this work, we report the synthesis and assessment of a new non-precious-metal oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst from pyrolysis of an iron-coordinated complex which manifests superior activity in both alkaline and acidic media. 11,11′-bis(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazinyl) (bidppz) was selected as a ligand for the formation of a nitrogen-rich iron-coordinated coordination polymer (Fe-bidppz) which forms a self-supporting catalyst containing high densities of nitrogen and iron doping by pyrolysis. The catalyst pyrolyzed at 800 °C (Fe-N/C-800) shows the highest ORR activity with onset and half-wave potentials of 923 and 809 mV in 0.1 M KOH, respectively, which are comparable to those of Pt/C (half-wave potential 818 mV vs RHE) at the same catalyst loading. Besides, the Fe-N/C-800 catalyst has an excellent ORR activity with onset and half-wave potentials only 38 and 59 mV less than those of the Pt/C catalyst in 0.1 M HClO

84923379466	Effects of pristane alone or combined with chloroquine on macrophage activation, oxidative stress, and Th1/Th2 skewness	We investigated the protective role of chloroquine against pristane-induced macrophage activation, oxidative stress, and Th1/Th2 skewness in C57BL/6J mice. Those mice were treated with pristane alone or combined with chloroquine. Hematological and biochemical parameters, macrophage phagocytic function, the oxidant/antioxidant index, cytokine for IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-6, and the isotypes of IgG2a and IgG1 were determined. And the expression of T-bet/GATA-3 and IL-12/IL-10 mRNA in spleen were analyzed by real-time PCR. We found that pristane treatment for a period of 12 or 24 weeks triggered macrophage activation syndrome, characterized by hemophagocytosis in spleen and peripheral blood, enhanced lipid phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages in vitro, erythropenia and leucopenia, increased anti-Smith, lactic dehydrogenase, triglyceride, and ferritin, as well as hypercytokinemia of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, and IL-6. In parallel, a significant increase in lipid peroxidation and a decrease in superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase activity, as well as a skewed Th1/Th2 balance in spleen, were observed. However, chloroquine supplementation showed a remarkable amelioration of these abnormalities. Our data indicate that pristane administration induces macrophage activation, oxidative stress, and Th1/Th2 skewness, which can be attenuated by chloroquine.
