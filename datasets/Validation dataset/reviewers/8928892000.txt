15944410990	Lumped-mass approach for the calculation of band structure of two-dimensional phononic crystals with high contrast of elastic constant	With each unit cell replaced by a system of finite freedoms of motion, two-dimensional phononic crystals can be simplified to an infinite discrete periodic system. Therefore, the elastic wave band structures of the two-dimensional phononic crystals can be calculated with a straightforward lumped-mass approach, whose computational cost is much lower than the well-known plane wave expansion (PWE) method. The numerical results of the two methods are in reasonable agreements. As the well-known Gibbs oscillations in the PWE can be eliminated with the lumped-mass method, this new approach is insensitive to the sharp variation of elastic constants on the interfaces inside the phononic crystals. Furthermore, the lumped-mass method can also be used to calculate the band structures of two-dimensional phononic crystals with arbitrary unit shapes easily.

Then the formation mechanism of the first complete gap in the corresponding tri- or bi-component phononic crystal is investigated by the multiple-scattering method. It is shown that the heavy density of the scatterer plays an essential role in the Mie resonance and the formation of the gaps for both types of the phononic crystals. For the tri-component phononic crystal, the gap is mainly induced by the Mie resonance of the single scatterer. For the bi-component phononic crystal, the transverse wave (by mode-conversion during the Mie scattering under a longitudinal wave incidence) is modulated by the periodicity and governed by the Bloch theory, which induces the gap cooperatively. © 2008 Chin.

54549124529	Optimal design of phononic crystal beams for attenuating vibration propagation	Phononic crystals (PC) are periodic structures or composites exhibiting elastic band gaps within which sound and vibration are all forbidden. For a PC sample with finite periods and finite size, vibration with certain frequency following into the gaps will be significantly attenuated when it propagates along the specimen. Such a property of PCs offers a new approach to control vibrations in engineering structures. However, PC beams with certain frequency gap will bring additional resonances with lower frequency, which are harmful and must be taken into account. Here in, A PC beam with periodically attached local resonators (LR beams) is used to attenuate vibration propagation from its one end to the other. The transfer matrix (TM) of LR beams is formulated and the vibration transmissibility is calculated with TM method. The insertion loss of those attached resonators is used as an indicator for comparison of different designs. The parameters of lo-cal resonators are optimized with genetic algorithm to minimize vibration transmission in specified frequency range covering both stopping band (gap) and passing band. In addition, constraint such as add-on mass and displacement limits are also taken into account during the optimization. The optimized results are analyzed for validation. The influences of resonators' parameters on the vibration transmissibility of LR beams are also investigated and summarized. The proposed optimizing approach and the summarized rules are referable for controlling vibration propagation in beams with PC gaps.

Based on the four-pole parameters method, a simple model for analyzing the axial vibration of submarines was proposed, which takes account of the elasticity of the hull, thrust bearing and shafts. The axial transmission of powerflow from shafting to the hull was investigated. It is found that the fluctuating thrust will induce resonances of the shafting and its elastic coupling with hull will result in powerflow peaks. Such resonances are more significant while their frequencies are around the axial modes of the shafting. Dynamic vibration absorbers were designed to depress such powerflow peaks. It is found that absorbers can reduce the powerflow more effectively when they are tuned to resonances around the axial modes of shafting than tuned to others.

A transfer matrix methodology is used to calculate the frequency range and attenuation properties of the LR band gap. Two main differences are found between the LR band gaps induced by shunting circuits and traditional oscillators. Antoniou's circuits are used to produce large ideal inductances necessary for low eigenfrequencies. The theoretical results are experimentally validated by measuring the harmonic response of the beam. Significant attenuation in the low-frequency LR band gap is observed.

79957647843	Vibration bandgaps of a phononic rod with piezoelectric shunting circuits	The electromagnetic oscillations of piezoelectric shunting circuits can lead to local resonant gap in a phononic rod. Here, the formation mechanisms of the local resonant gap were analyzed. The band gaps of the rod were calculated with the transfer matrix method. Furthermore, the influences of the inductance, capacitance and resistance of the shunting circuits on the local resonant gap were studied. The electromagnetic oscillations of piezoelectric shunting circuits could make the equivalent elastic modulus of a piezoelectric patch become negative and reduce the elastic modulus of a beam with the piezoelectric patch. When the real part of the elastic modulus was equal to zero, vibration could not propagate in the rod, so the local resonant gap formed. The location of the local resonant gap could be adjusted through changing the inductance and capacitance of the shunting circuits. The results provided a new way to actively control band gaps of phononic crystals.

Each piezo-patch is connected to a single resistance-inductance-capacitance shunting circuit. Therefore, the resonances of the shunting circuits will produce locally resonant gaps in the phononic beam. However, the existence of locally resonant gaps induced by resonant shunts has not been clearly proved by experiment so far. In this work, the locally resonant gap in a piezo-shunted phononic beam is investigated theoretically and verified by experiment.

The isolator is called periodic arch structure, which is composed of a number of identical reordered arch structures connected together along the vertical direction. The propagation characteristics of flexural waves in periodic arch structure are investigated by combining Bloch theorem with the finite element method, and the effect of dimension and material to band gaps are discussed. The discussions find that the height of the arch structure has no influence to the band gap, and the short height insulated low frequency vibration can be realized, which can solve the problem of dimension limit in practical application. The discussions also find that the range of band gap can be reduced by increasing the length of the structure, decreasing the thickness, modulus and density of the material. The predictions are validated by computation and experimental analysis of the harmonic responses of a finite structure with five unit cells.

A methodology based on a combination of the spectral element (SE) method and the Bloch theorem is developed, yielding an explicit formulation for the complex band structure calculation. The effects of resonator parameters on the band gap behavior are investigated by employing the attenuation constant surface plots, which display information on the location, the width and the attenuation performance of all band gaps. It is found that Bragg-type and resonance-type gaps co-exist in these systems. In some special situations, exact coupling between Bragg and resonance gaps occurs, giving rise to super-wide coupled gaps. The advantage of multi-degree-of-freedom resonators in achieving multiband and/or broadband gaps in metamaterial-based rods is demonstrated.

84860335054	Flexural wave band gaps in locally resonant thin plates with periodically attached springmass resonators	The authors study the propagation of flexural waves in a locally resonant (LR) thin plate made of a two-dimensional periodic array of springmass resonators attached on a thin homogeneous plate. The well-known plane wave expansion method is extended to deal with such a plate system with a periodic array of lumped resonant elements. Explicit matrix formulations are developed for the calculation of complex band structures, in which the imaginary parts of Bloch wave vectors are displayed to quantify the wave attenuation performance of band gaps. It is found that resonance-type and Bragg-type band gaps coexist in the LR plate, and the bandwidth of these gaps can be dramatically affected by the resonant frequency of local resonators. In particular, a super-wide pseudo-directional gap can be formed by a combination of the resonance gap and Bragg gap; inside such a pseudo-gap, only a very narrow pass band exists. An explicit formula is further developed to facilitate the design of such a pseudo-gap. Finally, vibration transmission in finite LR plates is calculated using the finite element method. Vibration transmission gaps are observed, and the results are in good agreement with the band gap properties predicted by the complex band structures. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84862878079	Optimization of locally resonant acoustic metamaterials on underwater sound absorption characteristics	The study of acoustic metamaterials, also known as locally resonant sonic materials, has recently focused on the topic of underwater sound absorption. The high absorption occurs only within a narrow frequency band around the locally resonant frequency. Nevertheless, this problem can be addressed through a combination of several acoustic metamaterial layers that have different resonant frequencies. In this paper, an optimization scheme, a genetic and a general nonlinear constrained algorithm, is utilized to enhance the low-frequency underwater sound absorption of an acoustic metamaterial slab with several layers. Both the physical and structural parameters of the acoustic metamaterial slab are optimized to enlarge the absorption band. In addition, the sound absorption mechanism of the acoustic metamaterial slab is also analyzed. The result shows that each layer is found to oscillate as a nearly independent unit at its corresponding resonant frequency. The theoretical and experimental results both demonstrate that the optimized metamaterial slab can achieve a broadband (800-2500 Hz) absorption of underwater sound, which is a helpful guidance on the design of anechoic coatings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863528656	Acoustic cloak/anti-cloak device with realizable passive/active metamaterials	Utilizing the coordinate transformation method, together with exchange of variables between Maxwell's equations and the acoustic equations with axial-invariance in cylindrical coordinates, the acoustic parameters (anisotropic density and scalar bulk modulus) for an ideal cloak and an ideal anti-cloak are obtained. An anti-cloak allows the inside object to see outside, but to be invisible from outside; whereas a cloak is invisible from outside, but blind from inside. Utilizing a scattering algorithm developed in this paper, the pressure field calculation of the cloak/anti-cloak is performed and the concepts and characteristics of the acoustic cloak/anti-cloak are revisited. To be more easily achievable experimentally, a multilayered cloak/anti-cloak model with homogeneous isotropic materials is introduced, and its corresponding pressure distributions are calculated. Also, the total scattering cross-section curves for the multilayered cloak and anti-cloak over a certain frequency range are presented and compared. Finally, an active acoustic metamaterial made up of piezo-diaphragm cavity arrays is designed for the cloak/anti-cloak. Taking into account the coupling between adjacent cavity cells, a multi-control strategy for piezo-diaphragm cavity arrays is exploited, rendering possible wide ranges of effective densities and effective bulk moduli (or acoustic speeds), or even double-negative transformation medium (i.e. both density and bulk modulus parameters are negative). With such sets of active acoustic metamaterials, the cloak and anti-cloak may become both theoretically and experimentally realizable. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84863653188	Analysis of absorption performances of anechoic layers with steel plate backing	Rubber layers with air-filled cavities or local resonance scatters can be used as anechoic coatings. A lot of researches have focused on the absorption mechanism of the anechoic coatings. As the anechoic coatings are bonded to the hull of submarine, the vibration of the hull should not be neglected when the analysis of the absorption characters is carried out. Therefore, it is more reasonable to treat the anechoic coating and the backing as a whole when the acoustic performance is analyzed. Considering the effects of the steel plate backing, the sound absorption performances on different models of anechoic coatings are investigated in this paper. The Finite Element Method is used to illustrate the vibrational behaviors of the anechoic coatings under the steel backings by which the displacement contours is obtained for analysis. The theoretical results show that an absorption peak is induced by the resonance of the steel slab and rubber layer. At the frequency of this absorption peak, the steel plate and the coating vibrates longitudinally like a mass-spring system in which the steel slab serves for mass and the coating layer is the spring. To illuminate the effects of the steel slab backing on the acoustic absorption, the thicknesses of the steel slab and the anechoic layer are discussed. Finally, an experiment is performed and the results show a good agreement with the theoretical analysis. © 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

84864386827	Research on a cylindrical cloak with active acoustic metamaterial layers	Enlightened by the tunable properties of effective density of the active acoustic metamaterial, we design an active infinite cylinder acoustic cloak according to the idea of the multilayer structured acoustic cloak with homogeneous isotropic materials. Utilizing the electrical analog, the dynamical equation of the acoustic cavity with Piezo-Diaphragm is presented. By analyzing the circuit diagram, the control strategy of achieving various effective densities which are used for constructing the acoustic cloak is given. Based on the necessary parameters such as the wide range values of the relative densities gained by active control, and the acoustic speed of each composite layer, the acoustic pressure field of the plane wave incident on the cloak is calculated, via the FEM model. Also the pressure map of a rigid cylinder scatterer with surrounded fluid is performed for comparison. Results show that outside the cloaking shell, the plane wave field is almost undisturbed. However inside the shell, the plane wavefronts are gradually deflected, and guided around the cloaked domain, returning to the original plane shape with small perturbation. This phenomenon making the cloak acoustically invisible in some frequency ranges has useful values in engineering applications. Finally, the total scattering cross section of the cloak is calculated to investigate the invisible effect according to the frequency domain. The total number of the composite active metamaterial layers is 15, which is much easier to realize in experiment. © Chinese Physical Society.

The modeling method abandons the previous incorrect assumptions and leads to a more precise result. A numerical investigation is based on an epoxy host rod with a periodic array of resistive-inductive shunted piezoelectric patches. The bandgaps are predicted by the application of Bloch theorem and transfer-matrix method.

Two analytical wave approaches are developed for the calculation of diffuse field sound transmission loss of such metamaterial-based thin plates. Numerical results show that a metamaterial-based plate can result in much higher sound transmission loss than a bare plate (with the same surface mass density) at frequencies within the mass-law region and the coincidence region.

It was shown that the elastic foundation can dampen the propagation of flexural waves under some particular frequency, but this does not cause a band gap; both the elastic foundation and axial forces can affect the band gap frequency of the pipe, but the elastic foundation can enhance the stability of the pipe with axial forces obviously.

To further reveal the sound absorption mechanism and optimize the low-frequency underwater sound absorption characteristic, the viscoelastic coating embedded with various shapes of scatterer is investigated. In this paper, to shorten the computing time of the original finite element program and save the core memory, the conventional finite element method is simplified due to the symmetry of the lattice and the scatterers, then the simplified finite element method is validated by comparing the results of the simplified finite element method with those of the conventional finite element method. The relationship between the resonance mode described with the displacement contours of one unit cell at specified frequencies and the corresponding absorption spectrum is discussed in detail, which reveals briefly the sound absorption mechanism of the viscoelastic coating embedded with cylindrical scatterer. Finally, the shape effect of the scatterer on the sound absorption characteristics is investigated, spherical scatterers and the three cylindrical scatterers with different shapes but the same volume are considered. Further, the influence of the density of the core on acoustic absorption characteristic under an air backing is discussed. The results show that lower sound absorption properties can be deduced by adopting the cylindrical scatterers and reducing the radius of the base of circular cylindrical scatterer, and the absorption bandwidth can be improved by choosing the optimal scatterer material. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

Such periodic systems feature unique wave filtering characteristics that can find applications in the control of wave propagation in flexural beam structures. The study is performed by using an exact analytical approach based on a combination of the spectral element method and periodic structure theory. Both infinite and finite periodic structures are considered. An explicit expression is provided for the calculation of propagation constants and thus the complex band structures, and it is further developed to examine the effects of various system parameters on the band-gap behavior, including the position, width and wave attenuation performance of all the band gaps. The band formation mechanisms of such periodic systems are explained via both derivations and physical models, yielding explicit equations to enable the prediction of all the band edge frequencies in an exact manner without the need to calculate propagation constants. Based on these equations, explicit formulas are further derived to determine the conditions for the transition and near-coupling between local resonance and Bragg scattering, each being a unique band-gap opening mechanism. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This article proposes an effective approach to gain the dispersion properties of the periodically shunted plate in any directions from the solutions of transcendental eigenvalue problems. The results show that resistive shunts can tune the location and attenuation constants of the Bragg gap, while the internal resonances of resonant shunting system split the dispersion curves and form a locally resonant band gap. Moreover, the Bragg gap is directional, whose width varies enormously with directions. However, the locally resonant gap almost keeps the same in different directions, i.e., the gap is complete. Also, the influences of different shunting parameters to the band gaps are investigated in detail. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the study of effective sound speeds of LRSMs, we find that the starting frequency of Bragg scattering can be shifted to sub-wavelength region by softening coats of resonators when the matrix is a low shear-velocity medium. A similar result can be achieved by compressing the lattice constant. By using a layer-multiple- scattering method, we investigate the complex band structure and the transmission spectrum of an LRSM whose Bragg gap is already close to the resonance gap in frequency. The wave fields of the composite simulated by COMSOL are further analysed at several typical frequencies. The result shows that the approaching of two kinds of gaps not only broadens the bandwidth of the resonance gap, but also increases the depth of the Bragg gap since the interaction between resonant modes and scattering waves are enhanced. By varying the shear velocity of coats, we obtain a coupled gap, which exhibits a broad transmission gap in the sub-wavelength region. When the loss of coats is considered, the coupled gap can not only maintain a good sound blocking performance, but also perform an efficient absorption in the low frequency region. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A finite element method (FEM) is utilised to conduct the investigation. In the passive periodic shell, two pivotal frequencies (i.e., the cut-off frequency of the periodic shell, and the resonant frequency of flexural vibration of shell ring), which are existed in an arbitrarily high circumferential mode, are found; the frequency range is divided into three regions by these two frequencies. Various band formation mechanisms and the dynamic properties within the three frequency regions are illustrated, with the aid of a series of vibration deformations. Furthermore, an active periodic shell is constructed. Several control methods, such as inverted displacement-, velocity- and acceleration-feedback control strategies, are explored for the active shell. Under these control strategies, the effects of negative stiffness, damping coefficient and mass modulation, can be produced, thus enabling the band gap generable and its characteristics, such as their bandwidth, location and attenuation coefficient, adjustable. The pressure level of the structure-borne sound is also suppressed along the shell within the band gaps. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84880529990	Tunable band gaps in acoustic metamaterials with periodic arrays of resonant shunted piezos	Periodic arrays of resonant shunted piezoelectric patches are employed to control the wave propagation in a two-dimensional (2D) acoustic metamaterial. The performance is characterized by the finite element method. More importantly, we propose an approach to solving the conventional issue of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and give a convenient solution to the dispersion properties of 2D metamaterials with periodic arrays of resonant shunts in this article. Based on this modeling method, the dispersion relations of a 2D metamaterial with periodic arrays of resonant shunted piezos are calculated. The results show that the internal resonances of the shunting system split the dispersion curves, thereby forming a locally resonant band gap. However, unlike the conventional locally resonant gap, the vibrations in this locally resonant gap are unable to be completely localized in oscillators consisting of shunting inductors and piezo-patches. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84880531038	Oblique incidence properties of locally resonant sonic materials with resonance and Bragg scattering effects	A locally resonant sonic material (LRSM) is an elastic matrix containing a periodic arrangement of identical local resonators (LRs), which can reflect strongly near their natural frequencies, where the wavelength in the matrix is still much larger than the structural periodicity. Due to the periodic arrangement, an LRSM can also display a Bragg scattering effect, which is a characteristic of phononic crystals. A specific LRSM which possesses both local resonance and Bragg scattering effects is presented. Via the layered-multiple-scattering theory, the complex band structure and the transmittance of such LRSM are discussed in detail. Through the analysis of the refraction behavior at the boundary of the composite, we find that the transmittance performance of an LRSM for oblique incidence depends on the refraction of its boundary and the transmission behaviors of different wave modes inside the composite. As a result, it is better to use some low-speed materials (compared with the speed of waves in surrounding medium) as the LRSM matrix for designing sound blocking materials in underwater applications, since their acoustic properties are more robust to the incident angle. Finally, a gap-coupled LRSM with a broad sub-wavelength transmission gap is studied, whose acoustic performance is insensitive to the angle of incidence. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84880281478	Exploration of amphoteric and negative refraction imaging of acoustic sources via active metamaterials	The present work describes the design of three flat superlens structures for acoustic source imaging and explores an active acoustic metamaterial (AAM) to realise such a design. The first two lenses are constructed via the coordinate transform method (CTM), and their constituent materials are anisotropic. The third lens consists of a material that has both a negative density and a negative bulk modulus. In these lenses, the quality of the images is "clear" and sharp; thus, the diffraction limit of classical lenses is overcome. Finally, a multi-control strategy is developed to achieve the desired parameters and to eliminate coupling effects in the AAM. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84881572804	Flexural wave band gaps in thin rectangular plate with periodic structure	The idea of the phononic crystals is introduced in the design of thin rectangular plates with two-dimensional periodic structure. Flexural wave band structures of such a plate with infinite structure are calculated with the plane-wave expansion method, and the ΓX directional band gaps are found. The acceleration frequency response in the ΓX direction of such a plate with six periods is simulated with the finite element method and verified with a vibration experiment. The frequency ranges of sharp drops in the calculated and measured acceleration frequency response curves are in basic agreement with the gaps in the band structures. Thin plate is a widely used component in engineering. The existence of band gaps in such periodic structures gives a new idea for vibration control of thin plates.

Flexural elastic wave band gaps of this locally resonant beam are found with its band structure calculated with the transfer-matrix method. The corresponding frequency response function of a finite sample composed of organic glass beam and rubber-copper oscillators is calculated with the finite element method. Those theoretical results are verified with the vibration experiment. The calculated and measured results show a good agreement. The existence of low-frequency band gaps in the locally resonant structure provides a new way in the flexural vibration control of beams.

84881234546	Theoretical and experimental study of locally resonant and bragg band gaps in flexural beams carrying periodic arrays of beam-like resonators	In this paper, we present a design of locally resonant (LR) beams using periodic arrays of beam-like resonators (or beam-like vibration absorbers) attached to a thin homogeneous beam. The main purpose of this work is twofold: (i) providing a theoretical characterization of the proposed LR beams, including the band gap behavior of infinite systems and the vibration transmittance of finite structures, and (ii) providing experimental evidence of the associated band gap properties, especially the coexistence of LR and Bragg band gaps, and their evolution with tuned local resonance. For the first purpose, an analytical method based on the spectral element formulations is presented, and then an in-depth numerical study is performed to examine the band gap effects. In particular, explicit formulas are provided to enable an exact calculation of band gaps and an approximate prediction of band gap edges. For the second purpose, we fabricate several LR beam specimens by mounting 16 equally spaced resonators onto a free-free host beam. These specimens use the same host beam, but the resonance frequencies of the resonators on each beam are different. We further measure the vibration transmittances of these specimens, which give evidence of three interesting band gap phenomena: (i) transition between LR and Bragg band gaps; (ii) near-coupling effect of the local resonance and Bragg scattering; and (iii) resonance frequency of local resonators outside of the LR band gap.

The directions and regions of wave propagation in the periodic grid-like structure for certain frequencies during pass bands are predicted with the iso-frequency contour lines of the phase constant surface, which are then validated with the harmonic responses of a finite two-dimensional such periodic structure with 15×15 unit cells. These results are useful for controlling the wave propagation in the pass bands of periodic structure.

84882998408	Low-frequency acoustic absorption mechanism of a viscoelastic layer with resonant cylindrical scatterers	This paper investigates low-frequency acoustic absorption mechanism of a viscoelastic layer with resonant cylindrical scatterers. The viscoelastic layer is 20 mm-thick, and the cylindrical scatterer is a cylindrical cavity coated with a soft rubber layer, with axis in the lateral layer direction. The absorption properties of the viscoelastic layer under the steel-backing condition are studied using the layer-multiple scattering method. Results show excellent absorption performance in the frequency region of 1000-3000 Hz. The absorption mechanism is investigated by analyzing the absorption cross-section of a single scatterer and the multiple scattering of a periodic array of scatterers, together with the displacement field and power dissipation density. Effects of the resonant absorption of a single scatterer and the coupling resonance between the absorption layer and the steel-backing are revealed. © Chinese Physical Society.

84883326344	Closer estimating of lowest band gap in ternary locally resonant phononic crystals	Based on better understanding of the lattice vibration modes, two simple spring-mass models are constructed in order to estimate the frequencies on both the lower and upper edges of the lowest locally resonant band gaps of both the two- and three-dimensional ternary locally resonant phononic crystals. The parameters of the models are given in a reasonable way based on the physical insight of the band gap mechanism. Both the lumped-mass methods and our models are used in the study of the influences of structural and the material parameters on frequencies on both edges of the lowest gaps of in the ternary locally resonant phononic crystals. The analytical estimations using our models and the theoretical predictions with the lumped-mass method are in good agreement. The heuristic models are helpful for better understanding of the locally resonant band gap mechanism, as well as better estimation of the band edge frequencies.

84883359305	Design of low frequency sound shield based on rigid body resonance	In this paper, we present numerical investigations on the Mie scattering, and show the rigid body resonance of single sphere. It is shown that the bottom of the lowest complete gap and the low frequency transmission dip of one-layer slab correspond with the rigid body resonance. The attenuation efficiency of the finite phononic crystal slab depends on the interaction between the rigid body resonance and matrix. By varying the size and geometry of the structural unit, we can tune the resonant frequency, i.e., the dip frequency of the slab. Base on this idea, a stacked four-layer slab, each layer containing different scatterer, is introduced as an effective broadband sound barrier. The improvement of the sound insulation in comparison with the periodic layered plate is also verified. Copyright© (2006) by the International Institute of Acoustics & Vibration.

84883390054	Comparison of the dynamics and wave propagation in composite polymers containing various particles	In the present paper, a medium having a periodic particle distribution is used to model the propagation of a plane longitudinal wave through an equivalent composite having a random microsphere distribution. It is proved that this technique is valid at low frequency range far below the Mie resonance and Bragg resonance, where the microscopic length scales (e.g., the microsphere diameter and the distance between microspheres) are small compared to the incident wavelength. The periodicity simplifies the computation by using the Bloch theory. Then the acoustic propagation through viscoelastic polymers containing various particles are investigated with a multiple scattering method, which are developed and applied in recent years to studies of band gaps for phononic crystals. For a basic understanding of the sound attenuation, the dynamics of the partials is investigated by reference to the elements of the scattering matrixes. Then the effects of the partial dynamics in sound attenuation of the composite polymers are also investigated.

84883136766	Backing effects on the underwater acoustic absorption of a viscoelastic slab with locally resonant scatterers	Backing effects on the underwater acoustic absorption of a viscoelastic polymer slab embedded with locally resonant scatterers are reported. The polymer slab is embedded with two layers of locally resonant scatterers, i.e. Al spheres coated by soft silicon rubber. Theoretical absorption coefficients of the polymer slab under different backings using a layer multiple scattering method show good agreement with the experimental results, which supports unambiguously the experimental observation. Then relations between the resonance modes and the low-frequency absorption peaks of the composite slab are clarified to address the absorption mechanisms. It shows that the mass of the steel backing affects evidently the low-frequency absorption, the absorption peak shifts to lower frequency range while increasing the backing mass. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the reverse vibration of adjacent cells, Transmission loss (TL) peaks appear, and the magnitudes of the TL peaks exceed the predicted results of the composite wall. Compared with commonly used configuration, i.e., all cells carrying with identical mass, the nonuniformity of attaching masses causes another much low TL peak. Finite element analysis was employed to validate and provide insights into the TL behavior of the structure. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

84892419363	Analysis and experimental realization of locally resonant phononic plates carrying a periodic array of beam-like resonators	We present theoretical examination and experimental demonstration of locally resonant (LR) phononic plates consisting of a periodic array of beam-like resonators attached to a thin homogeneous plate. Such phononic plates feature unique wave physics due to the coexistence of localized resonance and structural periodicity. We demonstrate that a low-frequency complete band gap for flexural plate waves can be created in the proposed structure owing to the interaction between the localized resonant modes of the beam-like resonators and the flexural wave modes of the host plate. We show that the location and width of the complete band gap can be dramatically tuned by changing the properties of the beam-like resonators. To understand the opening mechanism and evolution behaviour of the complete band gap, some approximate but explicit models are provided and discussed. We further perform experimental measurements of a specimen fabricated by an array of double-stacked aluminum beam-like resonators attached to a thin aluminum plate with 5 cm structure periodicity. The experimental results evidence a complete band gap extending from 465 to 860 Hz, matching well with our theoretical prediction. The LR phononic plates proposed in this work can find potential applications in attenuation of low-frequency mechanical vibrations and insulation of low-frequency audible sound. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84894036874	The beam-mode stability of periodic functionally-graded-material shells conveying fluid	The characteristics of beam-mode stability of fluid-conveying shell systems are investigated in this paper for shells with clamped-free (cantilevered) boundary conditions. An FEM algorithm is developed to conduct the investigation. A periodic shell structure of functionally graded material (FGM), termed as PFGM shell here, is designed so as to enhance the stability for the shell system, and to eliminate the stress concentration problems that exist in periodic structures. Results show that by the introduction of periodic design the critical velocities can be raised over several desired ranges of the dimensionless fluid density β, and the stress concentration is effectively reduced in the PFGM shell. Finally, the effects of the geometric shape, material parameters and spring supports on the dynamical stability are probed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84897746800	Stability of fluid-conveying periodic shells on an elastic foundation with external loads	This paper presents the beam-mode stability of a fluid-conveying periodic shell on an elastic foundation subjected to external loading. A transfer matrix (TM) method was developed to investigate the characteristics of steady-state waves in the system and the dynamic response of the periodic shell system. When subjected to external perturbations, including either a moving load or a stationary one, the shell may be subjected to instability for flow velocities exceeding a certain critical velocity. The system can also become unstable when a travelling load exceeds a certain critical value. The coupled effects of the speed of a moving load and the flow velocity of a fluid on the stability of the shell system were also investigated. A periodic structure was designed for such a shell system to enhance its dynamic stability. The periodic shell system produces innumerable velocity band gaps (VBGs), which could raise the critical velocity and extend the stable range for both the moving load and the flowing fluid. Finally, the formation mechanism of the VBGs was studied, as well as the effects of the thickness, length of the shell cells, Young[U+05F3]s modulus and stiffness of the elastic foundation on modulating the VBGs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84903764651	Reduction of vibration and noise radiation of an underwater vehicle due to propeller forces using periodically layered isolators	Using periodic structure theory, the suppression of vibration and noise radiation from an underwater vehicle due to excitation from propeller forces is investigated. The underwater vehicle is modelled in two parts (the hull and the propeller/shafting system). A model of the propeller/shafting system is constructed using a modular approach and considers the propeller, shaft, thrust bearing, isolation structure and foundation. Different forms of isolator are considered - a simple spring-damper system, a continuous rod and a periodically layered structure. The dynamic properties of the underwater vehicle and the isolation performances of various isolators are compared and analysed. The stop band properties of the periodic isolator are used to enhance the passive control performance. Furthermore, an integrated isolation device is proposed that consists of the periodic isolator and a dynamic absorber, and its isolation performance is investigated. The effects of the absorber parameters on the performance of the integrated device are also analysed. Finally, the radiated sound pressure is calculated to verify the attenuation. The numerical results show that the vibration and noise radiation are greatly attenuated in the stop bands. By optimising the design of the periodic isolators and its integrated structures, the suppression of the vibration and noise radiation can be improved effectively.

It has a lower frequency absorption peak than that with spherical cavity in the same size, which is determined by the monopole resonance of cavities. Analysis of partial wave scattering verifies that the absorption peak is induced by the monopole resonance. Power dissipation density and displacement pattern of one unit cell is used to clarify intuitively the absorption mechanism of the cavity. Then the effect of damping of transverse modulus on the absorption is investigated under the condition of a steel backing.

84905216307	Dynamical mechanical property of viscoelastic materials and its effect on acoustic absorption of coating	Viscoelastic macromolecular materials are widely used in underwater acoustic fields because of their favorable acoustic performance. Dynamical mechanical properties of viscoelastic materials, such as Young's modulus, shear modulus, and relevant loss factors, are important in the forecast of acoustic properties, which connect acoustical design of underwater coating with materials prescription design. Dynamic Young's modulus of some macromolecular materials is measured with dynamic mechanical apparatus (DMA), and then the basic acoustic parameters are expanded from a narrow band to a broad band by using principles of time-temperature superposition (TTS). When applying the basic parameters to calculating characteristics of the uniform layer sample by using the finite element method, a reasonable agreement of sound absorption coefficients is obtained between the calculations and measurements in the acoustic pipe. Furthermore, the underwater acoustic absorption properties of the coating with a local resonant structure are discussed. Finally, some suggestions are given about how to improve the underwater absorption performance at low frequencies. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

Its natural frequencies, sound radiation power and the mean square vibration velocity calculated agreed well with those using Comsol software. The layerwise theory was then used to analyze the influence of single/multi-layer viscoelastic material on the vibro-acoustic properties of the thin plate. The influences of fluid mass density and flow velocity on the characters of fluid were investigated as well. The results showed that the sound radiation is sensitive to the stacking sequence of damping layers; it is better to stack the layer with higher young's modulus on the out board, it can increase the structural acoustic radiation loss factor and reduce the sound radiation power; in addition, the vibro-acoustic characteristics of the thin plate in a fluid have a nonlinear change when fluid flows, they vary obviously when flow velocity is slow and they tend to be stable with increase in flow velocity.

84907624162	Acoustic anechoic layers with singly periodic array of scatterers: Computational methods, absorption mechanisms, and optimal design	The acoustic properties of anechoic layers with a singly periodic array of cylindrical scatterers are investigated. A method combined plane wave expansion and finite element analysis is extended for out-of-plane incidence. The reflection characteristics of the anechoic layers with cavities and locally resonant scatterers are discussed. The backing is a steel plate followed by an air half space. Under this approximate zero transmission backing condition, the reflection reduction is induced by the absorption enhancement. The absorption mechanism is explained by the scattering/absorption cross section of the isolated scatterer. Three types of resonant modes which can induce efficient absorption are revealed. Due to the fact that the frequencies of the resonant modes are related to the size of the scatterers, anechoic layers with scatterers of mixed size can broaden the absorption band. A genetic optimization algorithm is adopted to design the anechoic layer with scatterers of mixed size at a desired frequency band from 2 kHz to 10 kHz for normal incidence, and the influence of the incident angle is also discussed.

A classical LRAS is normally composed of a heavy core coated with soft silicon rubber and the LRASs are then adapted and embedded within the viscoelastic matrix materials to fabricate absorption materials. The resonance of LRAS at low frequency can lead to a substantial attenuation of the elastic wave. In this paper, the finite element method is used to investigate the absorption characteristics for a viscoelastic panel, containing a type of infinite long cylindrical LRASs (with axis in a lateral direction). The effect of different core positions in the coating layer on the sound absorption property has been investigated and the possible effect mechanism has been discussed.

84922666588	Acoustic band gap characteristics of one-dimensional pipe periodically installing double Helmholtz resonators	The study of acoustic and elastic wave propagation in artificial periodic structures has received increasing attention in the last few decades. The presence of band gaps in phononic crystals, which forbids elastic/acoustic wave propagation within the band-gap frequency range, supplies a new way to control noise and vibration. Koo and Sorokin study the acoustic and elastic wave propagation in artificial periodic pipe, focus attention into the vibration of the wall, and find the band gaps. The acoustic band gaps in artificial periodic pipe also get some researchers' attention recently. Acoustic characteristics in the cavity of the pipe periodically installing double Helmholtz resonators are investigated theoretically and numerically in this paper. The results are compared to double Helmholtz resonators with variable parameters including the length and radius of the necks and resonators. The resonance frequency, transmission loss and acoustic band gaps of the pipe system can be further modulated by the parameters of the double Helmholtz resonators based on our study. These numerical results show a good agreement with those of the simulation by FEM software, while showing that one double Helmholtz resonator has some positive acoustic band-gap characteristics. This provides us a possible way to achieve a wider acoustic band gap via using the double Helmholtz resonator with appropriate parameters.
