84949117057	Effects of deformation rate on ductility of Ti-6Al-4V material	To determine the velocity field in which the Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy sheet was sensitive to the strain rate, the formability at different strain rates were tested using a ring sample in the electromagnetic ring expansion experiment. For the test of titanium alloy, an aluminum alloy loop was used as a driver ring due to improve energy efficiency. The expansion velocity and strain rate of titanium ring were predicted by a numerical simulation method which had been verified by experimental data obtained with a high speed camera. The uniform strain was defined as the ratio of the change and the one after expansion of the cross sectional area in this study. Since the fracture strain of a material was related to the aspect ratio (ratio of length to diameter) of samples, the uniform strain was chosen to characterize the ductility of the material. The results indicate that when the tensile speed of Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy sample is 2 mm/min (quasi-static), the strain rate of deformation is 6.67×10

84949121067	Deep drawing of cylindrical cup using incremental electromagnetic assisted stamping with radial magnetic pressure	A new forming method named incremental electromagnetic assisted stamping with radial magnetic pressure is proposed to draw a deep cylindrical cup. The method combines with traditional stamping, electromagnetic sheet forming and electromagnetic launch technology. Three types of discharge coils are imbedded in die and blank holder, respectively. The 3D finite element model is set up to predict the complex deformation process. The forming process and principle of the new method are discussed. The values of material flow, stress and thickness in different forming processes are compared. In comparison with traditional stamping, incremental electromagnetic assisted stamping with radial magnetic pressure can significantly increase the value of material at sheet end flow inward, decrease the tensile stress and thickness reduction at the easily broken position, and obtain uniform stress distribution. Therefore, deeper cylindrical cup could be manufactured by incremental electromagnetic assisted stamping with radial magnetic pressure.

9444268104	NC incremental sheet metal forming process and vertical wall square box forming	The forming principle and deformation analysis of NC (numerical control) incremental sheet metal forming process as well as the process planning, experiment and key process parameters of vertical wall square box forming are presented. Because the deformation of sheet metal only occurs around the tool head and the deformed region is subjected to stretch deformation, the deformed region of sheet metal thins, and surface area increases. Sheet metal forming stepwise is to lead to the whole sheet metal deformation. The forming half-apex angle θ and corner radius R are the main process parameters in NC incremental forming of vertical wall square box. According to sine law, a vertical wall square box can't be formed by NC incremental sheet metal forming process in a single process, however, it must be formed in multi processes. Thus, the parallel line type tool path process method is presented to form the vertical wall square box, and the experiment and analysis are made to verify it.

33744523328	Study on instability of the point bolster sheet metal dieless forming	The point bolster dieless forming, which adopts point rod as bolster instead of the conventional model bolster, eliminates the constraint of the mould in order to realize the real dieless forming. Even though the feasibility of this new forming method is verified by plenty of practical experiments and FEM simulation on the axisymmetric part, there are still several kinds of forming instability flaws. These flaws include collapse, radial ridge and circumferential ridge. The generation of radial ridge and circumferential ridge lies on the dimension of the transient plastic region. Furthermore, the dimension of the transient plastic region lies on the following three factors: the material's mechanical properties, thickness of the sheet metal and shape of the forming tool. The collapse comes from the initial instability under the propagation of stress wave if the following three factors are neglected: orientation error, blank holder's oscillation and material's slip around the bolster. The collapse is essentially one kind of shell dynamic buckling. To overcome these flaws, this paper provides corresponding solutions after the instabilities are analyzed and summarized. Meanwhile, these solutions are experimentally validated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through the stress and stain distribution at the different stages of the process, the deformation principle of incremental forming is researched. The research shows that the area of deformation can be divided into four parts with different deformation patterns in the forming process; on the action of compression stresses, the higher forming limit could be reached.

40949135804	Deformation analysis of sheet metal single-point incremental forming by finite element method simulation	Single-point incremental forming (SPIF) is an innovational sheet metal forming method without dedicated dies, which belongs to rapid prototyping technology. In generalizing the SPIF of sheet metal, the deformation analysis on forming process becomes an important and useful method for the planning of shell products, the choice of material, the design of the forming process and the planning of the forming tool. Using solid brick elements, the finite element method (FEM) model of truncated pyramid was established. Based on the theory of anisotropy and assumed strain formulation, the SPIF processes with different parameters were simulated. The resulted comparison between the simulations and the experiments shows that the FEM model is feasible and effective. Then, according to the simulated forming process, the deformation pattern of SPIF can be summarized as the combination of plane-stretching deformation and bending deformation. And the study about the process parameters' impact on deformation shows that the process parameter of interlayer spacing is a dominant factor on the deformation. Decreasing interlayer spacing, the strain of one step decreases and the formability of blank will be improved. With bigger interlayer spacing, the plastic deformation zone increases and the forming force will be bigger.

77954350932	Springback model for air-bending of sheet metal based on dimensional analysis method	Springback is a very important factor to influence forming accuracy of sheet metal. Accurate controlling of springback is the key to precision forming and tool design. In view of the shortcoming of traditional trial-and-error method used to correct springback, a technique based on dimensional analysis and orthogonal test is proposed to establish springback radius model for air-bending of sheet metal. And the scope of application of mathematical model for springback is discussed. With this model, the non-linear relation between springback radius of sheet metal and punch radius, sheet thickness, yield strength, Young's modulus can be quantitatively solved, and it is used to design and make air-bending punch. Then, a semiellipse-shape workpiece, whose average errors are +0.63/-0.65mm, is made with the punch. The manufacturing results show that springback radius model, established with dimensional analysis and orthogonal test, is reasonable and effective. The modeling method is helpful to speeding up the progress of tool design and reducing production cost.

84867348803	A unified method for invalid 2D loop removal in tool-path generation	In tool-path generation, the cutter contact (CC) contours and cutter location (CL) contours are basic elements. Invalid loops in these contours should be removed before planning the tool-path. According to the characteristic of intersection, all invalid loops can be divided into two cases: the general case and the degenerate case. A unified method for invalid two-dimensional (2D) loop removal is presented in this paper for both these cases. This method consists of four major steps: (1) finding all intersections in given polygons, (2) building the topology for each intersection point and grouping given polygons into complex polygons, (3) decomposing each complex polygon into simple polygons, and (4) extracting valid polygons from the simple polygons. The complex polygon decomposition operation is the decisive step of this method, and it is carried out as follows. First, the concept of virtual self-intersecting polygon and the criterion of priority exit-point direction determination are proposed to make sure that all general and degenerate cases can be solved in a uniform way. And then a set of simple polygons is obtained by traversing all the vertices in the complex polygon once and performing a series of tracing-direction-changing operations at each intersection point. This decomposition operation has a near-O(n) time-complexity, where n denotes the number of vertices in the complex polygon. In the extraction step, the concept of valid orientation is proposed; based on this concept, this method can be applied to both CC contours and CL contours, and then valid polygons are extracted by the criterion of invalid loop removal. The proposed algorithm has been implemented, tested with some general and degenerate cases, and applied in tool-path generation for the sheet metal incremental forming process. Performance tests show that this unified method for invalid loop removal is also robust and efficient. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

45949101511	Three-dimensional finite element method simulation of sheet metal single-point incremental forming and the deformation pattern analysis	Further research of the sheet metal single-point incremental forming (SPIF), which is a flexible sheet metal numerical forming method without dedicated dies, has used finite element method (FEM) simulation to analyse the forming principle and the effect of process parameters on the forming. In SPIF, the located region of the blank in contact with the forming tool is formed incrementally along the trajectory. There is no symmetric load and geometry condition, so the FEM model could not be simplified to a symmetrical model and the efficiency of simulation is bad. In this paper, brick elements are used to establish the whole three-dimensional FEM model and a simplified three-dimensional FEM model of a truncated cone and truncated pyramid. Comparison of the simulation results from the two models indicates that both models fit the simulation of SPIF but the simplified model is more efficient. Therefore, based on the simplified FEM model of a truncated pyramid, the SPIF process with different parameters was simulated to study the incremental forming principle. It was found that the deformed blank could be divided into three regions with different deformation patterns and the main character of the deformation could be conceded as a combination of bending and stretching. © IMechE 2008.

58449102418	Numerical simulation and experimental investigation of incremental sheet forming process	In order to investigate the process of incremental sheet forming (ISF) through both experimental and numerical approaches, a three-dimensional elasto-plastic finite element model (FEM) was developed to simulate the process and the simulated results were compared with those of experiment. The results of numerical simulations, such as the strain history and distribution, the stress state and distribution, sheet thickness distribution, etc, were discussed in details, and the influences of process parameters on these results were also analyzed. The simulated results of the radial strain and the thickness distribution are in good agreement with experimental results. The simulations reveal that the deformation is localized around the tool and constantly remains close to a plane strain state. With decreasing depth step, increasing tool diameter and wall inclination angle, the axial stress reduces, leading to less thinning and more homogeneous plastic strain and thickness distribution. During ISF, the plastic strain increases stepwise under the action of the tool. Each increase in plastic strain is accompanied by hydrostatic pressure, which explains why obtainable deformation using ISF exceeds the forming limits of conventional sheet forming. © 2008 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

A three-layer back propagation neural network (BPNN) is developed to best fit this discrete engineering problem involving many parameters of air-bending forming. A genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the weights of neural network for minimizing the error between the predictive punch radius and the experimental one. Then, with the predicted punch radius and other geometrical parameters of a tool, 2D and 3D ABAQUS finite-element models (FEM) are established, respectively. The original forming process of multiple-step incremental air-bending of sheet metal, obtained from geometric planning for semiellipse-shaped workpiece, is simulated using the FEM. This process is further adjusted with simulation-optimization results, because of existing large errors in the workpiece simulated with the original forming process. Finally, a semiellipse-shaped workpiece, with average errors of +0.61/-0.62 mm, is manufactured with the optimized adjustment process. The experimental results show that the punch design method is feasible with the prediction model of GA-BPNN, and the means of optimizing process with FEM simulation is effective.

Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the algorithm can match the corresponding reference points more precisely and efficiently and therefore meet the real-time requirement of the hand-held sensor applications compared with previous algorithms. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

70349466513	Mould correction for sheet-metal multi-step incremental air-bending forming based on close-loop control and FEM simulation	There exist errors between the manufactured workpieces and the CAD models due to the springback of sheet-metal incremental air-bending forming. To reduce these errors, an off-line closed-loop control iterative algorithm, combined by fast Fourier and wavelet transform, is developed from the displacement adjustment method (DAM), smooth displacement adjustment method (SDAM) and deformation transfer function method (DTFM) for die surface. With this algorithm, the mould surface of sheet-metal incremental air-bending forming could be properly corrected, and the springback errors of the formed workpieces could be effectively reduced. In order to reduce mould cost and labor cost, the springback tests of workpieces forming, needed in the iterative process of closed-loop control system, are substituted by finite element model (FEM) simulation. The above correction algorithm was used in a semiellipse-shape workpiece incremental air-bending forming. Its average errors are +0.74/-0.39 mm. The results show that the mould correction algorithm with Fourier and wavelet transform is reasonable and the means of FEM simulation are effective. It can be taken as a new approach for sheet-metal multi-step incremental air-bending forming and mould design. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is suitable for sheet parts with complex, curved faces. Most research on incremental air-bending forming are mainly based on experiments and explain the process through macroscopic metal deformation. Based on Hill's yielding criterion and exponential strain hardening law as well as plane strain conditions, an analytical model and ABAQUS finite element model (FEM) are proposed in this article for investigating the incremental air-bending forming process. Firstly, the multiple-step incremental air-bending forming processes on different bending tool parameters are simulated with the FEM to analyze the influences of the tool parameters on formed shape, air-bending forming force, and warpage deformation of the workpiece. Then, the multiple-step incremental air-bending forming process of a semi-ellipse-shaped workpiece with 11, 535 mm × 574 mm × 453 mm is simulated with FEM established by the optimum tool parameters as well as the optimal process parameters.

However, the existing simulations are lmostly limited to 2D model or simplified as independent physics fields. In order to propose a new coupling method suitable for complex 3D models, a three-dimensional finite element model and a loose coupling method are used to analyze electromagnetic sheet free bulging. The Lagrangian algorithm is used for sheet meshes to analyze the sheet deformation process, and the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian algorithm is used for air meshes, so that the air 3D meshes can follow the deformation of the sheet without distortion, thus realizing the iteration coupling analysis of magnetic field and structure field. The dynamic and distortion-free hexahedron meshes can ensure the accuracy of date transfer between the magnetic field analysis module and the plastic forming module. Thereby not only the operational speed is improved, but also accurate calculation results can be obtained. The comparison between the simulation results and the experimental ones indicates the deformation laws in simulation results agree with the experimental ones. © 2011 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

The adaptive remeshing technique is used in air meshes to make it change regularly according to the deformation result of the sheet. The deformed sheet is imported into electromagnetic model to calculate the magnetic force in next time step. Therefore, the method solves the problem of electromagnetic-structure coupling analysis.

But the forming processes and problems aimed to this kind of parts remain to be investigated further now. In this paper, based on single point incremental forming process, the TC4 titanium alloy aircraft parts with a complex double curvature was studied. In order to reduce the springback during the forming process an appropriate addendum surface was added to the part surface, and then ABAQUS software was applied to carry out numerical simulation of the forming and springback process. The results show that springback of complex titanium part with double curvature is small at both ends of part while large in the middle and the distribution of springback orientation depends on the curvature. For that the part is difficult to form by single point incremental forming process without springback compensation, so the tool path needs to be improved firstly. The simulation results can play a role for guiding the parameters selection and the compensated surface design of single point incremental forming process which can achieve the cold forming of parts with complex structure for poor formability materials. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

Thus, a new tool-path generation method is presented by adopting the thought of generating cutter-location (CL) data directly from corresponding cutter-contact (CC) data. By analyzing the interference characteristics between fillet-end tool and model surface and considering tangential case and intersection case comprehensively, a discrete computational model is proposed to calculate single-layer interference-free CL contour, instead of computing a precise CL point by checking potential interferences from candidate facet, vertices, and edges, respectively. So this method is more efficient and easier for program implementation. Additionally, a fast recursive search algorithm is developed to identify and extract flat area features, and an efficient 2D invalid loops removal algorithm based on decomposition thought is presented to obtain valid CC contours and CL contours with a near linear time-complexity. Implementation tests prove that the new method is effective and robust for STL model with defects, and tool-path achieved is highly precise. It is also applicable to various tool shapes and suitable for planning various types of tool-paths to meet different SMIF process requirements. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2012.

84874338922	3D Numerical simulation method of electromagnetic forming for low conductive metals with a driver	Electromagnetic forming (EMF) process is a high-speed forming process which can inhibit warping, reduce springback, and improve the formability of material at room temperature. In general, the electromagnetic forming process is applied to high-conductive metals such as copper, aluminum, and their alloys. In order to solve the problem of the low formability of titanium alloy, the electromagnetic forming process can be applied to form titanium alloy. The effects on the forming properties of titanium and other low-conductive metals must be studied before the EMF process is used. To that end, this paper presents a tool: a 3D numerical simulation method of electromagnetic forming with a driver. First, the electromagnetic field distribution and electromagnetic forces are calculated using the ANSYS/EMAG software. The resulting data are then imported to ABAQUS/Explicit software to carry out mechanical analysis. Although the electromagnetic field calculation does not take the deformation of the blank into account, the results accurately reflect the law of the deformation. This method is especially suitable for cases involving small deformations, such as tube compression and embossing. The calculation can also be used to simulate the impact forming process between the driver and the blank. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

In electromagnetic free bulging, the forming limit of Ti-6Al-4V increases by 24.37%, which is more optimistic than AA5052-O. Fractography analysis using SEM determines that the Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy sheet fails in a combination of ductile fracture and shear fracture when subjected to the electromagnetic bulging process while only ductile fracture develops in quasi-static condition. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879971193	Study on the homogeneity of deformation under electromagnetic expansion of metal tube	In this paper, a 3D numerical simulation method was put forward by coupling magnetic-structural fields, and its reliability was verified through comparing with the experimental data offered by Suzuki. According to the characteristics of electromagnetic expansion of metal tube, this simulation method was used to analyze the uniformity of tube expansion when the length of tube was less than that of the coil. Meanwhile, a curve of homogeneity of electromagnetic tube expansion with different aspect ratios (ratio of length to diameter) of tube was given based on the criterion of uniformity on deformation at the condition of specific parameters presented in this paper. By analyzing the mechanical characteristics of tube expansion, a length range of tube was found where the tube deformed uniformly. The results derived from this paper provided a good guidance for optimization design of electromagnetic ring expansion experiments which will be conducted on and this could ultimately promote the application of electromagnetic forming. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors.

84885726761	3D simulation of electromagnetic forming for tube bulging based on FEM	A loose coupling method and a 3D model are used to simulate the electromagnetic tube bulging process. ANSYS/EMAG is used to obtain the nodes force, then, the nodes force is used as the loading condition to model the high-rate deformation of the tube with ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The two models are updated at 17.5μs intervals. The maximum axial force is not in the location 40mm away from the center, but 37mm.Because some edge effects in real geometries could not be taken into consideration due to the nature of 2D simulations. Radial force is much larger than the axial force, so the tube is deformed by radial force. The simulation result of displacement at the center of tube with the time and the final tube shape in this paper is very close to the experiment.

84886521093	Electromagnetic incremental forming (EMIF): A novel aluminum alloy sheet and tube forming technology	Large parts cannot be shaped by conventional electromagnetic forming method due to the limitation of the strength of working coil and the capacity of capacitor bank. In this paper, based on the principle of single point incremental forming, a new method named electromagnetic incremental forming (EMIF) has been proposed. The method makes use of a small coil and small discharge energy to cause workpiece local deformation in a high speed. Finally, all local deformations accumulate into large parts. For the electromagnetic incremental sheet forming, the effect factors of processing parameters namely discharge voltage, vent hole, discharging times in a fixed position and the number of discharge region, on final sheet shape are investigated by using AA3003 aluminum alloy parts. In addition, two different simulation strategies are proposed to predict electromagnetic incremental sheet and tube forming process. For method 1: the technology like "birth-death element" is used to indirectly describe the movement of the coil and the morphing technology is used to make the air change with the workpiece deformation. For method 2: the coil can directly move to a special position and the remesh technology is used to consider the effect of the workpiece deformation and the movement of coil on magnetic analysis. It is found that method 1 cannot be used for electromagnetic incremental sheet forming process if overlap region exists in two adjacent discharge regions. However, method 1 can successfully predict electromagnetic incremental tube forming. And method 2 can be used for electromagnetic incremental sheet or tube forming. Both of the experimental and simulation results demonstrate that this new technology is feasible to produce large part. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84888369862	Effect of second current pulse and different algorithms on simulation accuracy for electromagnetic sheet forming	In the past, many simulation methods for electromagnetic forming (EMF) just consider the effect of the first half current pulse on electromagnetic forming process. And it is deemed that the sequence coupling method has a higher accuracy than loose coupling method because the effect of workpiece deformation on magnetic analysis is considered. In this work, the loose coupling method and sequence coupling method are both used to investigate how the second half current wave affects the simulation result. If the first current pulse is only considered in the simulation process, higher accuracy can be obtained by loose coupling method at 4,366 Hz of discharge current or sequence coupling method at 2,183 Hz of discharge current. If the second current pulse is also considered, the sequential coupling method can obtain more precise results than loose coupling method in the two different current frequencies. With the increase of displacement, the loose coupling method could cause a bigger overestimation than sequential coupling method. Then, the total resistance in EMF system is adjusted to obtain different damping exponent. It is found that the effect of the second current pulse on sheet deformation increases with the increasing of the discharge frequency. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.

12744262014	Algorithm of pillar support generation for stereolithography	The algorithm of pillar support generation was introduced to realize pillar support automatically generated in STL format. The thought of the algorithm was introduced as follows: First define the rule of stationing pillar-growing points in the cube of a part; then calculate each triangle intersections of the part and its correlated stationing rays; and finally generate the centerlines of pillar support by these intersections in 3D space. It was shown that the algorithm was fast in generating pillar support and realized the real-time simulation of pillar support generation. The algorithm has been applied to the system of stereolithography.

13444311768	Synthesis of photosensitive diluent of butyl glycidylether acrylate	The technique for the photosensitive reactive diluent of butyl glycidylether acrylate with low smell and low irritant was prepared by using butyl glycidylether and acrylic acid as two main materials and taking triethylamine as the catalyst and p-hydroxyanisole as the inhibitor. The effects of temperature, dosages of the catalyst and the inhibitor on the reaction were studied. It was shown that the preferable synthesizing conditions are as follows: the temperature is 100-110°C, the catalyst mass fraction is 0.60%-0.80% and the inhibitor mass fraction is 0.20%-0.40%. The experiment indicated that the synthesized reactive diluent could effectively dilute the epoxy acrylate with high viscosity.

12344320462	Study on the green laser with 532 nm wave length induced photocuring of photosensitive resin	The photocuring of a kind of photocurable resin consisting fluorinated diphenyltitanocene employed as photoinitiator (PPI) induced by 532 nm laser beam was studied in this paper. The influences of some factors, such as the PPI content, the scan velocity of laser beam, and oxygen on the gel content of photosensitive resin were investigated. It shows that increasing content of PPI, reducing scan velocity of the laser beam, and overlaying oxygen barrier layer are in favor of the informing of the gel content. The result indicates that this photosensitive may be used in stereolithography for its low volumetric shrinkage (6.03%) and linear shrinkage (0.583%).
