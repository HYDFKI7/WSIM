84940215961	Identification and expression analysis of salt-responsive genes using a comparative microarray approach in Salix matsudana	Salt stress exerts negative effects on plant growth, development and yields, with roots being the primary site of both perception and damage. Salix matsudana (Chinese willow) is tolerant of high salinity. However, genes associated with this trait were rarely characterized. Therefore, we first performed salt-stress treatment on S. matsudana plants, then identified differentially expressed genes by comparison of salt-treated roots and untreated controls using microarray analysis. A total of 403 salt-responsive genes were identified, of which 239 were repressed and 164 were up-regulated. Functional classification analysis revealed that these genes belonged to families encoding proteins involved in metabolism, regulation of transcription, signal transduction, hormone responses, abiotic stress responses, and other processes related to growth and development. This suggested that when S. matsudana was confronted with salt stress, coordinated adjustments are made to physiological and biochemical processes, which would then allow more resources to be allocated to protective mechanisms to avoid salt injury. The expression patterns of representative genes were further validated and the diversity of the temporal profiles indicated that a combination of several genes and the initiation of diverse pathways performed functions in S. matsudana salt tolerance. This work represents the first study employing microarrays to investigate salt tolerance in S. matsudana. The data presented herein enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of S. matsudana responses to salinity stress and lay the groundwork for genetic engineering strategies to improve stress tolerance of agronomically important species.

19344378688	RNA interference library and its application in functional genomics	With the completion of human genome sequencing, the next challenge is to understand the function of each gene. RNA interference (RNAi) library can be used in large scale loss-of-function and phenotype screening. Although RNAi libraries have been proved to be a powerful tool of functional genetic screening in model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, their use in mammalian cells has been hampered by toxic effect induced by long dsRNA. However, since 2003, several RNAi libraries that can be used in mammalian cells have been established and used for functional genetic screening. As a simple, effective, large scale and high-throughput screening technique in functional genomics, RNAi library can be used in functional genetic screening, drug target discovery and validation, disease gene discovery and many other areas.

33645892006	A simple strategy for generation of gene knockdown constructs with convergent H1 and U6 promoters	RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful tool for functional genetic studies in model organisms and mammalian cells. To facilitate rapid construction of gene knockdown constructs and RNAi libraries for known genes of mammalian cells, a new and simple strategy to produce small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors with two opposing polymerase III promoters was developed. The design involved a one-step PCR amplification and single cloning procedure to construct a dual promoter siRNA expression vector. The forward primer is identical for all PCR reactions, only a single reverse primer that contains the siRNA targeting sequence has to be synthesized in the construction of each individual vector. This single primer design is cost-effective and it reduces the risk of sequence errors during synthesis of long oligos. Sense and antisense strands of siRNA duplexes were transcribed from the same template and this eliminated the need to synthesize long hairpin-forming oligonucleotides. Our study demonstrated that this vector design could mediate potent inhibition of expression of both exogenous and endogenous genes in mammalian cells. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

33646394038	The transformation of betA gene into the pollen plantlets of Populus simoniixP. nigra	In this study, betA gene was introduced into the pollen plantlets of Populus simoniixP. nigra using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The four kanamycine-resistant plants obtained were identified as transgenic plants by PCR detection and the results were all positive (Fig.2). The result of quantitative real-time PCR detection showed that the betA gene was transcribed and expressed in all the transformed plants, but the transcript levels are different (Table 2). Test of salt-tolerance of the transgenic plants showed that 80%-100% of transgenic plants were rooted while 0 of non-transgenic plants were rooted at 0.55% NaCl stress, and O of transgenic plants were rooted at 0.70%-0.80% NaCl stress (Table 3). The betaine content analysis showed the betain content of the transgenic plants are obviously higher than that in non-transgenic plants (Fig.4), so transformation betA gene raised the salt tolerance to the transgenic plants.

33749606718	A novel LEA gene from Tamarix androssowii confers drought tolerance in transgenic tobacco	A novel LEA gene (DQ663481) was cloned from Tamarix androssowii. The cDNA sequence of this LEA gene is 676 bp in length, including 157 bp of the 5′ untranslated region and 207 bp of the 3′ untranslated region. The open reading frame (ORF) is 312 bp in length, encoding a deduced amino acid sequence of 103 residues with a molecular weight of 11.257 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.93. BLASTP analysis showed that the cloned LEA gene shares the highest identity in amino acid sequence (47%) with LEA5 from Nicotiana tabacum. The cloned LEA gene was transformed into tobacco, after which 10 transgenic lines were selected for drought tolerance testing. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrical conductivity, percentage of wilted leaves and relative rate of height growth were compared between transgenic and nontransgenic tobacco. The results showed that both the MDA content and relative electrical conductivity are lower significantly in transgenic plants under drought stress, implying that the LEA gene may enhance drought tolerance by protecting cell membranes from damage. The comparison of the percentage of wilted leaves and relative rate of height growth between transgenic and nontransgenic tobacco showed that, under drought stress, the presence of the LEA gene can induce an increase in height growth rate and a reduction in the number of wilted leaves. These results indicate that the T. androssowii LEA gene is an excellent drought tolerance gene and may have potential usage in the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in plants. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33845882483	Identification of expressed sequence tags in an alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora) cDNA library	Alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora), a monocotyledonous halophyte, can serve as a model of salt tolerance in monocotyledon crops. To elucidate the molecular events associated with salt tolerance in alkali grass, we generated a directional cDNA library from leaves treated with the alkali salt, NaHCO<inf>3</inf>. Large-scale sequencing of the cDNA library identified 2942 ESTs representing 2366 non-redundant transcripts. These have been deposited in the dbEST division of GenBank. BLASTX evaluation indicated that 1274 of the ESTs were homologous to various known genes/proteins in a broad range of organisms, especially gramineae species. The other 1092 ESTs, which showed little if any homology to known sequences, were considered novel. Based on the encoded proteins, the 1274 identified ESTs fell into 12 functional categories, of which four were abundant, namely metabolism (18.84%), transcription (12.48%), unclassified (11.22%) and cell rescue/defense (9.66%). The 162 unique transcripts corresponding to possible salt-related genes were also identified. This study provides an overview of gene expression in NaHCO<inf>3</inf>-stressed alkali grass, as well as useful information for further investigation of salt resistance in plants. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

34547199438	Efficient tissue culture and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of haploid poplar derived from anthers	Calli were induced from anthers of Populus simonii × P. nigra. Haploid plants were then regenerated from the callus and multiplied efficiently by culturing leaf explants. The presence of both haploid and diploid cells in the same plant revealed spontaneous chromosome doubling in haploid cells. The haploid plants were transformed with the nptII gene by Agrobacterium-mediated method using leaf explants, and five independent kanamycin-resistant lines were obtained, with a transformation frequency more than 6%. Further PCR test indicated that the exogenous betA gene was transferred into these kanamycin-resistant lines, which were still haploid. Thus, the efficient tissue culture system and transformation of haploid poplar plants were achieved. Our study will contribute to forest improvement via the haploid culture and transgenic technology. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

34547893850	A cDNA-based random RNA interference library for functional genetic screens in embryonic stem cells	To facilitate high-throughput functional genetic screens in embryonic stem cells, a simple and efficient system to construct cDNA-based random RNA interference (RNAi) library was developed in the study. Previous studies have demonstrated that sequence-specific gene silencing could be induced by long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in mouse embryos, mouse oocytes, embryonic stem cells, and other mammalian cells. Based on these findings, a dsRNA-expressing RNAi vector system was designed. This study provided evidence that the vector design could induce efficient knockdown of expression of both exogenous egfp gene and endogenous MTM1 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells. A random RNAi library was established by cloning enzyme-digested cDNA of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into the BamHI site of the convergent dual promoter RNAi vector. Sequencing of 20 randomly selected clones from the library showed that 17 contained inserts and that all of them were unique sequences. A functional genetic screen of genes involving in self-renewal and differentiation with the random RNAi library identified ubiquitin. The ubiquitin knockdown ES cell line generated 20%-30% of undifferentiated colonies in the absence of leukemia inhibitor factor, whereas parental ES cells and control vector pDCont transfectants produced less than 5% of colonies of undifferentiated cells, suggesting that ubiquitin plays a role in ES cell differentiation. The random RNAi library provides a useful tool for investigation of molecular mechanisms of cellular development and differentiation. ©AlphaMed Press.

59649086635	Identification of genes responsive to salt stress on Tamarix hispida roots	Plant roots are the primary site of perception and injury for salinity stress. In order to characterize the complexity of adaptation to salty environments in roots of Tamarix hispida, a woody halophyte, expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis was performed. Three cDNA libraries were generated from root tissues of T. hispida that were exposed to 0.4 M NaCl for 0 (control), 24 and 48 h. A total of 7726 ESTs were generated from the three libraries, and were assembled into 1142 contigs and 3026 singletons. EST analysis was performed to compare gene expression in the three cDNA libraries. Ninety redundant unique transcripts responsive to NaCl treatment were identified. Of them, 21 genes were novel or of unknown function while others were involved in the functional activities, such as ROS scavenging, lipid metabolism, osmolyte biosynthesis, signal transduction, transport, lignin synthesis and homeostasis. The genes, including those for metallothionein-like protein, polyubiquitin, hypothetical protein, and glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, were abundant in the libraries and showed obvious up-regulation after NaCl treatments, suggesting important roles in NaCl tolerance. The results of this study may contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of salt tolerance in the roots of plants. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79951549932	Genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferase genes and susceptibility to colorectal cancer: A case-control study in an Indian population	Background: Susceptibility to sporadic colorectal cancer is multifactorial and arises from interactive combinations of allelic variants in low-penetrance genes and relevant environmental risk factors. Genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes as gene susceptibility factors may modify colorectal cancer risk. We evaluated the risk of colorectal cancer associated with respective or combined glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms and assessed the interactions between genes and environmental factors in a case-control study in an Indian population. Methods: The study included 59 colon and 243 rectal cancer cases, and 291 cancer-free healthy controls. GST genotypes were detected by multiplex PCR-based and PCR-RFLP methods. The risk of cancer associated with GST polymorphisms was estimated by calculation of odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (95% CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. Results: The GSTM1 null genotype was found to be associated with a significantly increased rectal cancer risk (OR. = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.05-2.30), while the GSTT1 null genotype with a greater risk of colon cancer (OR. = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.04-4.32). A substantial increase of both colon (OR. = 10.81; 95% CI, 1.11-107.22) and rectal (OR. = 4.80; 95% CI, 0.94-35.91) cancer risk was shown for the combination of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and GSTP1 105Val allele. The combined GSTM1 null and GSTP1 114Val allele also revealed an increased risk for either colon cancer (OR. = 4.69; 95% CI, 0.84-23.87) or rectal cancer (OR. = 5.68; 95% CI, 1.79-22.16). Furthermore, the combination of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and GSTP1 114Val allele was found in 2 rectal cancer cases. Conclusion: Our results suggest that co-exist of GSTM1 null, GSTT1 null and the variant GSTP1 105Val or 114Val allele may be predisposing risk factors for colorectal cancer in Indian population. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

80052514479	A systemic proteomic analysis of Populus chloroplast by using shotgun method	The chloroplast is one of the most important organelles in plants. Proteomic investigations of chloroplasts have been undertaken for many herb plant species, but to date no such investigation has been reported for woody plant chloroplasts. In the present study we initiated a systematic proteomic study of Populus chloroplasts using a shotgun proteomic method. After isolation of chloroplasts and tryptic digestion of the proteins, the protein fragments were separated via HPLC using an SCX column, and the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS; 119 proteins were successfully identified. Based on annotation information in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, these proteins were identified as being localized in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, chloroplast stroma, chloroplast thylakoid lumen, and plastoglobules. Over 50% of all identified proteins were confirmed as chloroplast thylakoid proteins, and 85 are encoded by the chloroplast genome with the remaining proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. Based on functional annotation, these proteins were classified into four functional categories, including photosynthesis, redox regulation and stress, primary and secondary metabolism, transport and signaling. These data provide a valuable basis for further studies on photosynthesis in poplar species.

84861785288	Selection of the optimum fertilizer formula and the effects of nutrient elements on growth and flowering performance of Betula platyphylla	Three fertilizer formulae (T1, T2 and T3) of various nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels were applied to 1-, 2- and 3-year-old Betula platyphylla seedlings of a half-sib family, respectively, with the objectives of comparing their effects on seedling flowering and fruiting and selecting the optimum one. Then, we investigated the effects of each element (N, P and K) of the optimum formula on growth and development of B. platyphylla seedlings. Results showed that: 1) all formulae significantly increased flowering, compared with no fertilizer (control), with the great response occurring at T3. 2) In T3, nitrogen was most effective in improving vegetative growth, making the 3-year-old trees reach 3.08 m in height and 25.76 mm in ground diameter, increased by 19.38% and 39.17% respectively than control. 3) Nitrogen fertilizer promoted flowering more effectively than phosphorus or potassium fertilizer. Applying nitrogen improved the flowering rate of 3-year-old trees to 49%, compared with only 4%, 1%, and 0 by applying only phosphorus, potassium or without fertilizer. However, applying T3 produced significantly more flowers than applying nitrogen alone, increasing the flowering rate to 90%; 4) During the development from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, some nutrition was allocated for reproductive growth, which reduced the height growth but not diameter growth of the current year.

84867036879	Transcriptome Sequencing and De Novo Analysis for Ma Bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro) Using the Illumina Platform	Background: Bamboo occupies an important phylogenetic node in the grass family with remarkable sizes, woodiness and a striking life history. However, limited genetic research has focused on bamboo partially because of the lack of genomic resources. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies enables generation of genomic resources in a short time and at a minimal cost, and therefore provides a turning point for bamboo research. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing for the first time to produce a comprehensive dataset for the Ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro). Results: The Ma bamboo transcriptome was sequenced using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We produced 15,138,726 reads and assembled them into 103,354 scaffolds. A total of 68,229 unigenes were identified, among which 46,087 were annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database and 28,165 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. Of these annotated unigenes, 11,921 and 10,147 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology categories and clusters of orthologous groups, respectively. We could map 45,649 unigenes onto 292 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. The annotated unigenes were compared against Moso bamboo, rice and millet. Unigenes that did not match any of those three sequence datasets are considered to be Ma bamboo unique. We predicted 105 unigenes encoding eight key enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis. In addition, 621 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected. Conclusion: Our data provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for D. latiflorus Munro. Candidate genes potentially involved in growth and development were identified, and those predicted to be unique to Ma bamboo are expected to give a better insight on Ma bamboo gene diversity. Numerous SSRs characterized contributed to marker development. These data constitute a new valuable resource for genomic studies on D. latiflorus Munro and, more generally, bamboo. © 2012 Liu et al.

84867333764	Diagnostic performance of multiplex cytokine and chemokine assay for tuberculosis	Simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers might lead to improved diagnostic performance for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In this study, we screened soluble biomarkers that had significant differences in patients with active tuberculosis and healthy controls and evaluated the diagnostic performance of the multiplex cytokine/chemokine assay. Overall, 178 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 156 healthy individuals and 35 patients with bacterial pneumonia or lung cancer were evaluated. Among the 16 soluble biomarkers screened by the microbead-based multiplex assay, five cytokines/chemokines including IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG, TNF-α and IL-2 that showed most significant differences between active pulmonary tuberculosis patients and healthy controls were selected for further analysis. When analyzed individually, both IP-10 and MIG had sensitivity and specificity comparable to IFN-γ in detection of active TB. Combined detection of IFN-γ, IP-10 and MIG had significantly improved sensitivity and specificity as compared with individual cytokine and chemokine detection. The responsive levels of IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG, TNF-α and IL-2 were significantly lower in re-treatment pulmonary tuberculosis patients than in new tuberculosis patients. It is concluded that combined IFN-γ, IP-10, MIG multiplex detection had better diagnostic performance for tuberculosis than the individual cytokine/chemokine assays. The re-treatment pulmonary tuberculosis patients had poor responses to ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides stimulation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84866648937	Polymorphisms of the DNA Methyltransferase 1 Associated with Reduced Risks of Helicobacter pylori Infection and Increased Risks of Gastric Atrophy	Introduction: DNA methyltransferase-1(DNMT1) is an important enzyme in determining genomic methylation patterns in mammalian cells. We investigated the associations between SNPs in the DNMT1 gene and risks of developing H. pylori seropositivity, gastric atrophy and gastric cancer in the Chinese population. Methods: The study consisted of 447 patients with gastric cancer; 111 patients with gastric atrophy; and 961 healthy controls. Five SNPs, rs10420321, rs16999593, rs8101866, rs8111085 and rs2288349 of the DNMT1 gene were genotyped. Anti-H.pylori IgG was detected by ELISA. Gastric atrophy was screened by the level of serum pepsinogen Ιand II and then confirmed by endoscopy and histopatholgical examinations. Results: The age- and sex-adjusted OR of H. pylori seropositivity was 0.67 (95%CI: 0.51-0.87) for rs8111085 TC/CC genotypes, significantly lower than the TT genotype in healthy controls. The adjusted OR of H.pylori seropositivity was 0.68 (95%CI: 0.52-0.89) for rs10420321 AG/GG genotypes. In addition, patients carrying rs2228349 AA genotype have a significantly increased risk for H.pylori seropositivity (OR = 1.67; 95%CI: 1.02-2.75). Further haplotype analyses also showed that the ATTTG and ATCTA are significantly associated with increased risks in H.pylori infection compared to the GTCCG haplotype (OR = 1.38, 95%CI: 1.08-1.77; OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.09-1.80). The adjusted ORs of gastric atrophy were 1.66 (95%CI: 1.06-2.61) for rs10420321 GG genotype, and 1.67 (95%CI 1.06-2.63, P = 0.03) for rs8111085 CC genotype, but no association was found between SNPs in the DNMT1 gene and risk of developing gastric cancer. Conclusions: Individuals with rs10420321 GG and rs8111085 CC genotype of the DNMT1 gene were associated with reduced risks for H.pylori infection. On the other hand, higher risks of gastric atrophy were found in the carriers with these two genotypes compared to other genotypes. Our results suggested that SNPs of DNMT1 could be used as genotypic markers for predicting genetic susceptibilities to H.pylori infection and risks in gastric atrophy. © 2012 Jiang et al.

84866675221	Test of IL28B Polymorphisms in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Treated with PegIFN and Ribavirin Depends on HCV Genotypes: Results from a Meta-Analysis	Background: Many studies have been published on the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) near the IL28B gene and response to the combined treatments of pegylated-interferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) in chronic HCV-infected patients, but without identical conclusions. The aim of this study was to assess impact of the IL28B polymorphisms on the effect of HCV standard treatment using meta-analysis based method. Methods: Association studies between polymorphisms of rs12979860 or rs8099917 and response to PegIFN/RBV treatment in chronic HCV patients were retrieved from PubMed. Data of qualified studies on sustained virological response (SVR) in different genotypes were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis method in Stata 10 software. Results: Thirty-four papers, containing 46 independent studies, were included in the analysis. In the HCV G1/4 patients without treatment history, individuals carrying rs12979860 CC genotype were more likely to achieve SVR (OR 3.97, 95%CI 3.29-4.80) compared to those carrying CT/TT genotypes. Similar results were observed in the HCV G1/4 patients with unsuccessful or unknown treatment history (OR 3.76, 95%CI 2.67-5.28) or in the patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (OR 5.20, 95%CI 3.04-8.90). However, associations could not be observed in HCV G2/3 patients. For rs8099917, similar results were obtained for genotype TT compared to genotypes TG/GG, indicating that TT genotype was significantly associated with better treatment response in patients infected with genotype 1 or 4 HCV, but not genotype 2 or 3 HCV. Conclusion: Polymorphisms of rs12979860 and rs8099917 near IL28B only associate with the treatment response to PegIFN/RBV in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4 but not with genotype 2 or 3, irrespective of the previous treatment history or HIV co-infected status. Therefore, identification of IL28B genotypes is necessary only in patients infected with relatively difficult-to-treat genotype 1 or 4 HCV. © 2012 Jia et al.

84876804937	Effects of insulin and IGF-I on growth hormone- induced STAT5 activation in 3T3-F442A adipocytes	Background: Growth hormone (GH) and insulin signaling pathways are known important regulators of adipose homeostasis. The cross-talk between GH and insulin signaling pathways in mature adipocytes is poorly understood. Methods. In the present study, the impact of insulin on GH-mediated signaling in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes and primary mice adipocytes was examined. Results: Insulin alone did not induce STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, but enhanced GH-induced STAT5 activation. This effect was more pronounced when insulin was added 20 min prior to GH treatment. The above results were further confirmed by in vivo study, showing that insulin pretreatment potentiated GH- induced STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation in visceral adipose tissues of C57/BL6 mice. In addition, our in vitro results showed that IGF-I had similar potentiating effect as insulin on GH-induced STAT5 activation. In vitro, insulin and IGF-I had an additive effect on GH- induced MAPK activation. Conclusion: These results indicate that both insulin and IGF-I specifically potentiated GH mediated STAT5 activation in mature adipose cells. These findings suggest that insulin and GH, usually with antagonistic functions, might act synergistically to regulate some specific functions in mature adipocytes. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84887608917	The presence of hepatitis B core antibody is associated with more advanced liver disease in alcoholic patients with cirrhosis	Background: Liver disease is more severe in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections and alcohol-induced liver injury. Whether the same is true for alcoholic patients with cirrhosis who have recovered from previous HBV infections remains to be determined. Objectives: To document the extent of liver disease in alcoholic patients with cirrhosis who test negativefor hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and test positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Methods: Two hundred fifty-four alcoholic patients with cirrhosis were divided into anti-HBc-positive (N=171) and anti-HBc-negative (N=83) cohorts. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical features were retrospectively analyzed. Prognostic scores and the prevalence of patients at high risk for short-term mortality were calculated. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with an increased risk for short-term mortality. Results: Jaundice was more common in the anti-HBc-positive cohort (32.2% vs. 18.1%, p=0.02). This cohort also had higher serum bilirubin (70.9 vs. 50.4μ m/L, p=0.03), prothrombin times (15.6 vs. 14.4s, p=0.01), MELD scores (8.5 vs. 4.6, p=0.01), i-MELD scores (28.6 vs. 24.7, p=0.03), MDF scores (14.2 vs. 6.8, p=0.02) and ABIC scores (7.2 vs. 6.6, p=0.01). In addition, anti-HBC-positive patients were more often at high risk for short-term mortality (40.4% vs. 26.5%, p=0.03). Multivariate analysis identified anti-HBc-positive status (OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.10-3.36) and alcohol intake ≥150g/day (OR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.10-3.66) as independent risk factors for high risk of mortality. Conclusion: The anti-HBc-positive state is associated with more advanced liver disease in alcoholic patients with cirrhosis. A prospective study including HBV-DNA testing and liver biopsies should be considered to validate and further elucidate these findings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84897540546	Advance in mass spectrometry-based analysis of intact glycopeptides	Glycosylation is a common form of protein post-translational modification and plays key roles in biological processes, which is closely related to the occurrence, development, diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Although the rapid development of biological mass spectrometry-based technology offers great conveniences to identification of glycosylation sites, peptides sequences and glycan structures of glycoproteins respectively, the illumination of the linkage between proteins and glycans and the analysis of the structure of intact glycopeptides still face a lot of difficulties and challenges. Based on literature researches, the major directions of the field were determined. This review will focus on MS analysis of the site-specific intact glycopeptides and describes the development and prospects of biological mass spectrometry-based technology for the analysis of intact glycopeptides on many aspects, from ion source and mass analyzers to dissociation modes and the analysis of mass spectrometric data.

84897974529	Family selection of birch tetraploid half-sibling based on seed vigor and seedling growth traits	In this experiment, we compared tetraploid-and diploid-families of birch in seed and seedling quality. Seeds of 23 half-sib families (18 tetraploid-and 5 diploid-families) were collected from a seed orchard and their seedlings were grown in a nursery. The measured traits included thousand-seed weight, germination potential, germination rate, vigor index, seedling height and ground diameter. The results showed that: there were significant (P < 0.01) family effects for all studied traits. On average, the thousand-seed weight of triploid-families was 22.42% higher than that of diploid-families. While the tetraploid Q53 half-sibling family showed the highest germination potential (56.67%) and vigor index (37.62), all other tetraploid-families displayed lower values than diploid ones. For seedling height, the diploid-families were taller than the tetraploid ones; the top three families were all diploid-families and the tallest one, the diploid-family CK1, was 31.04% higher than other families. The ground diameter growth, however, showed a reversal pattern, with most of the top-ranking families being tetraploid-families. Based on the results of principal component analysis, tetraploid-families Q53, Q65, Q13 and Q27 were identified as the superior families. We recommend the seed trees of these families as preferred seed trees in the future establishment of triploid seed production gardens.

84908457923	Identifying progression related disease risk modules based on the human subcellular signaling networks	Many studies have shown that the structure and dynamics of the human signaling network are disturbed in complex diseases such as coronary artery disease, and gene expression profiles can distinguish variations in diseases since they can accurately reflect the status of cells. Integration of subcellular localization and the human signaling network holds promise for providing insight into human diseases. In this study, we performed a novel algorithm to identify progression-related-disease-risk modules (PRDRMs) among patients of different disease states within eleven subcellular sub-networks from a human signaling network. The functional annotation and literature retrieval showed that the PRDRMs were strongly associated with disease pathogenesis. The results indicated that the PRDRM expression values as classification features had a good classification performance to distinguish patients of different disease states. Our approach compared with the method PageRank had a better classification performance. The identification of the PRDRMs in response to the dynamic gene expression change could facilitate our understanding of the pathological basis of complex diseases. Our strategy could provide new insights into the potential use of prognostic biomarkers and the effective guidance of clinical therapy from the human subcellular signaling network perspective.

84908266173	Interaction of six candidate genes in essential hypertension	We explored the interaction of 6 candidate genetic mutations in essential hypertension (EH). The mutations AGT M235T, ACE I/D, eNOS Glu298Asp, ET-2 A985G, ANP T2238C, and NPRC A-55C were detected using a genechip microarray in 100 patients with EH and 97 controls from the Han population living in the Yunnan Province of China. Risks of EH were evaluated with respect to a combination of these genotypes. Interactions were analyzed using multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR). P values were corrected using Bonferroni’s adjustment. Results showed that CC genotype frequencies for NPRC A-55C (0.540) in EH were significantly higher than those in controls (0.237, P<inf>c</inf> < 0.01; odds ratio (OR) = 3.777; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.050-6.960). The OR for NPRC A-55C CC combined with ET-2 A985G GG increased to 4.673 and to 5.529 when the MT genotype of AGT M235T, the EE genotype of eNOS Glu298Asp, the GG genotype of ET-2 A985G, and the CC genotype of NPRC A-55C were combined. MDR showed that ET-2/NPRC is the best model (OR = 4.002; 95%CI = 2.1597-7.4159). The CC genotype for NPRC A-55C and the G allele for ET-2 A985G were associated with susceptibility to EH. Although the contributions of the candidate genes differ, they may have cooperative effects on conferring risk for EH. Moreover, potential gene-gene interactions were found between ET-2 A985G and NPRC A-55C in EH.

44649168952	Endotoxin-induced proteolytic reduction in hepatic growth hormone (GH) receptor: A novel mechanism for GH insensitivity	GH is an important anabolic hormone. We previously demonstrated in cell culture that the cell surface GH receptor (GHR) is susceptible to inducible metalloproteolytic cleavage that yields the shed receptor extracellular domain (called GH binding protein) and renders the cells desensitized to subsequent GH stimulation. Sepsis and inflammatory states are associated with hepatic desensitization to GH, although disparate mechanisms have been postulated in various animal models. Using C3H/HeJ mice, we now demonstrate that administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes marked hepatic desensitization to GH, assessed by monitoring signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation and with a novel noninvasive bioluminescence imaging system to track in vivo hepatic GH signaling serially in individual mice. This endotoxin-induced desensitization was accompanied by marked loss of hepatic GHR, which was not explained by changes in GHR mRNA abundance. Furthermore, we observe that LPS causes GH-binding protein shedding of a hepatically expressed wild-type GHR but not a GHR with a mutation in the metalloprotease cleavage site. These data suggest that in this model system, LPS-induced desensitization to GH is associated with proteolytic GHR cleavage. These data are the first to demonstrate inducible in vivo GHR proteolysis and suggest this is a mechanism to regulate GH sensitivity and its anabolic effects during sepsis or inflammation.

52549095339	The expression patterns of β1,4 galactosyltransferase I and V mRNAs, and Galβ1-4GlcNAc group in rat gastrocnemius muscles post sciatic nerve injury	Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications. It is clear that the single step of β1,4-galactosylation is performed by a family of β1,4-galactosyltransferases (β1,4-GalTs), and that each member of this family may play a distinct role in different tissues and cells. β1,4-GalT I and V are involved in the biosynthesis of N-linked oligosaccharides and play roles in sciatic nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve injury. In the present study, the expression of β1,4- galactosyltransferase (β1,4-GalT) I, V mRNAs and Galβ1-4GlcNAc group were examined in rat gastrocnemius muscles after sciatic nerve crush and transection. Real time PCR revealed that β1,4-GalT I and V mRNAs expressed at a high level in normal gastrocnemius muscles and decreased gradually from 6 h, reached the lowest level at 2 weeks, then restored gradually to relatively normal level at 4 weeks after sciatic nerve crush. In contrast, in sciatic nerve transection model, β1,4-GalT I and V mRNAs decreased gradually from 6 h, and remained on a low level at 4 weeks in gastrocnemius muscles after sciatic nerve transection. In situ hybridization indicated that β1,4-GalT I and V mRNAs localized in numerous myocytes and muscle satellite cells under normal conditions and at 4 weeks after sciatic nerve crush, and in a few muscle satellite cells at 4 weeks after sciatic nerve transection. Furthermore, lectin blotting showed that the expression level of the Galβ1-4GlcNAc group decreased from 6 h, reached the lowest level at 2 weeks, and restored to relatively normal level at 4 weeks after sciatic nerve crush. RCA-I lectin histochemistry demonstrated that Galβ1-4GlcNAc group localized in numerous membranes of myocytes and muscle satellite cells in normal and at 4 weeks after sciatic nerve crush, and in a few muscle satellite cells at 2 and 4 weeks after sciatic nerve transection. These results indicated that the expressions of β1,4-GalT I, V mRNAs and Galβ1-4GlcNAc group were involved in the process of denervation and reinnervation, which suggests that β1,4-GalT I, V mRNAs and Galβ1-4GlcNAc group may play an important role in the muscle regeneration. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

64749092097	Interruption of growth hormone signaling via SHC and ERK in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes upon knockdown of insulin receptor substrate-1	Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a docking protein tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin, IGF-1, GH, and other cytokines. IRS-1 has an N-terminal plekstrin homology domain (which facilitates membrane localization), a phosphotyrosine-binding domain [which associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor or IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)], and tyrosine residues that, when phosphorylated, bind signaling molecules. The role of IRS-1 in GH signaling is uncertain. We previously reported that IRS-1 and Janus kinase 2 associate independently of tyrosine phosphorylation via IRS-1's N terminus and that IRS-1 reconstitution greatly enhances GH-induced ERK, but not STAT5, activation. We now use GH-responsive 3T3-F442A preadipocytes to study the influence of IRS-1 on GH action. We stably transfected cells with vector only (Control) or a vector encoding IRS-1 short hairpin RNA [knockdown (KD)] and compared representative clones. Immunoblotting confirmed more than 80% knockdown of IRS-1 in KD cells. GH caused characteristic Janus kinase 2 and STAT5 activation in both Control and KD cells, but ERK activation was dramatically reduced in KD cells in GH time course and dose-response experiments. Notably, GH-induced Src homology collagen (SHC) activation and SHC-Grb2 association in KD cells were also markedly diminished compared with Control cells. Subcellular fractionation revealed that IRS-1 in Control cells was largely cytosolic, but the component isolated with plasma membranes was highly enriched in lipid raft membranes (LR). In KD cells, GH-induced ERK activation in the LR fraction was particularly diminished compared with Control cells. These data suggest that LR-enriched IRS-1 contributes substantiallyto GH-induced ERK activation in LRin3T3-F442A fibroblasts. Furthermore, our results are consistent with IRS-1 residing upstream of SHC in the GH-induced ERK-signaling pathway.

67649239015	A ThCAP gene from Tamarix hispida confers cold tolerance in transgenic Populus (P. davidiana × P. bolleana)	The ThCAP gene, which encodes a cold acclimation protein, was isolated from a Tamarix hispida NaCl-stress root cDNA library; its expression patterns were then assayed by qRT-PCR in different T. hispida tissues treated with low temperature (4°C), salt (400 mM NaCl), drought (20% PEG6000) and exogenous abscisic acid (100 μM). Induction of ThCAP gene was not only responsive to different stress conditions but was also organ specific. When transgenic Populus (P. davidiana × P. bolleana) plants were generated, expressing ThCAP under regulation of the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV 35S promoter, they had a greater resistance to low temperature than non-transgenic seedlings, suggesting that ThCAP might play an important role in cold tolerance. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

67349192223	Essential role of Src suppressed C kinase substrates in schwann cells adhesion, spreading and migration	Integrin-mediated substrate adhesion of endothelial cells leads to dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates reorganization of microfilaments and adhesion, while the responses of Schwann cells during adhesion and migration are unknown, so we examined the expression changes of SSeCKS and F-actin in Schwann cells after exposure to fibronectin. Src (sarcoma) suppressed C kinase substrate (SSeCKS) is a PKC substrate that may play an important role in regulating actin cytoskeleton. We found that SSeCKS was localized to focal adhesion sites soon after Schwann cells adhesion and that SSeCKS increased during the process of cell spreading. Using small interfering RNAs specific to SSeCKS, we showed that Schwann cells in which SSeCKS expression was inhibited reduced cellular adhesion, spreading and promoted cellular migration on fibronectin through reorganization of actin stress fibers and blocking formation of focal adhesions. These results demonstrated SSeCKS modulate Schwann cells adhesion, spreading and migration by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

69249115274	Expression of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase I in rat Schwann cells	Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications. It is clear that the single step of β-1,4-galactosylation is performed by a family of β-1,4-galactosyltransferases (β-1,4-GalTs), and that each member of this family may play a distinct role in different tissues and cells. In the present study, real-time PCR revealed that the β-1,4-GalT I mRNA reached peaks at 2 weeks after sciatic nerve crush and 3 days after sciatic nerve transection. Combined in situ hybridization for β-1,4-GalT I mRNA and immunohistochemistry for S100 showed that β-1,4-GalT I mRNAs were mainly located in Schwann cells after sciatic nerve injury. In conclusion, β-1,4-GalT I might play important roles in Schwann cells during the regeneration and degeneration of the injured sciatic nerve. In other pathology, such as inflammation, we found that LPS administration affected β-1,4-GalT I mRNA expression in sciatic nerve in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and β-1,4-GalT I mRNA is expressed mainly in Schwann cells. These results indicated that β-1,4-GalT I plays an important role in the inflammation reaction induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Similarly, we found that β-1,4-GalT I in Schwann cells in vitro was affected in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in response to LPS stimulation. All these results suggest that β-1,4-GalT I play an important role in Schwann cells in vivo and vitro during pathology. In addition, β-1,4-GalT I production was drastically suppressed by U0126 (ERK inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), or SP600125 (SAPK/JNK inhibitor), which indicated that Schwann cells which regulated β-1,4-GalT I expression after LPS stimulation were via ERK, SAPK/JNK, and P38 MAP kinase signal pathways. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

72449175177	Cloning of ten peroxidase (POD) genes from Tamarix Hispida and characterization of their responses to abiotic stress	Plant peroxidases (PODs) have been ascribed a variety of biological functions, including hydrogen peroxide detoxification, lignin biosynthesis, hormonal signaling, and stress response. In the present study, ten POD genes, including three ascorbate peroxidases (class I PODs) and seven secretory peroxidases (class III PODs), were cloned from Tamarix hispida. The roles of the ten POD genes were addressed under different abiotic stress conditions, and gene expression profiles in roots, stems, and leaves were evaluated using real-time quantitative reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction. Our results showed that the relative abundance of the PODs was markedly different in roots, stems, and leaves, indicating that POD activity differs in these three organs. ThPOD1 and ThPOD8 were the most and least abundant, respectively, in all organs. The expression profiles in response to abiotic stresses were organ specific. All of the genes were highly induced by drought, salt, salt-alkaline, CdCl

73949150404	ROCK pathway participates in the processes that 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) mediated the pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by hypoxia in rat	15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a product of arachidonic acid (AA) catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), plays an essential role in hypoxic pulmonary arterial hypertension. We have previously shown that 15-HETE inhibits apoptosis in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To test the hypothesis that such an effect is attributable to the hypoxia-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling (PVR), we performed these studies. We found subtle thickening of proximal media/adventitia of the pulmonary arteries (PA) in rats that had been exposed to hypoxia. This was associated with an up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and down-regulation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 and Bax expression in PA homogenates. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), which inhibits the generation of endogenous 15-HETE, reversed all the alterations following hypoxia. In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry showed that the 15-LO-1 mRNA and protein were localized in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), while the 15-LO-2 mRNA and protein were localized in both PAECs and PASMCs. Furthermore, the Rho-kinase (ROCK) pathway was activated by both endogenous and exogenous 15-HETE, alleviating the serum deprivation (SD)-induced PASMC apoptosis. Thus, these findings indicate that 15-HETE protects PASMC from apoptosis, contributing to pulmonary vascular medial thickening, and the effect is, at least in part, mediated via the ROCK pathway. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

74849085099	15-HETE protects rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells from apoptosis via the PI3K/Akt pathway	15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a metabolic product of arachidonic acid (AA), plays an important role in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle remodeling. Although its effects on the apoptotic responses are known, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. Since Akt is a critical regulator of cell survival and vascular remodeling, there may be a crosstalk between 15-HETE anti-apoptotic process and PI3K/Akt survival effect in rat pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of 15-HETE on cell survival and apoptosis using Western blot, cell viability measurement, nuclear morphology determination, TUNEL assay and mitochondrial potential analysis. We found that activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling system was necessary for the 15-HETE to suppress PASMC apoptosis and improve cell survival. Our results indicated that 15-HETE inhibited the apoptotic responses of PASMCs, including morphological alterations, mitochondrial depolarization and the expression apoptosis-specific proteins. These effects were likely to be mediated through the activation of PI3K/Akt. Two downstream signal molecules of PI3K/Akt were identified. Both FasL and Bad were down-regulated by 15-HETE and 15-HETE phosphorylated Bad. These changes depended on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in PASMCs. Thus a signal transduction pathway was demonstrated which is necessary for the effects of 15-HETE in protection PASMCs from apoptosis. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77249145335	Inhibition of nitric oxide-induced nuclear localization of CAPON by NMDA receptor antagonist in cultured rat primary astrocytes	Astrocytes play a key role in regulating aspects of inflammation in the central nervous system. It was observed that nNOS had located in the nucleus of cultured cerebral cortical astrocytes of 7 days. In the present study, we found that carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) mainly located in the nucleus of astrocytes stimulated with NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or GSNO or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist-NMDA. However, originally, it was localized mostly in the cytoplasm of normal astrocytes. Immunocytochemistry showed that nNOS was co-localized with CAPON in the nucleus of astrocytes stimulated with SNP. In addition to the nuclear localization, treatment with SNP increased the mRNA and protein expression of CAPON. When SNP was removed from media, CAPON accumulated in nucleus transported back to cytoplasm. MK801, an inhibitor of NMDA receptor, was able to reverse the nuclear localization of CAPON resulted from SNP, suggesting that there is a functional relationship of NO with NMDA receptor in the regulation of the nuclear localization of CAPON. These findings provide a new insight in the understanding of the physical and pathological significances of CAPON/nNOS/NMDA receptor. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77951933563	ThPOD3, a truncated polypeptide from Tamarix hispida, conferred drought tolerance in Escherichia coli	The ThPOD1 gene encodes a peroxidase and was isolated from a Tamarix hispida NaCl-stress root cDNA library. We found that ThPOD1 expression could be induced by abiotic stresses such as cold, salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid. These findings suggested that ThPOD1 might be involved in the plant response to environmental stresses and ABA treatment. To elucidate the function of this gene, recombinant plasmids expressing full-length ThPOD1 as well as ThPOD2 (aa 41-337), and ThPOD3 (aa 73-337) truncated polypeptides were constructed. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of the fusion proteins revealed that the molecular weights of ThPOD1, ThPOD2 and ThPOD3 were ̃57, ̃50 and ̃47 kDa, respectively. Stress assays of E. coli treated with the recombinant plasmids indicated that ThPOD3 could improve resistance to drought stress. This finding could potentially be used to improve plant tolerance to drought stress via gene transfer. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

77952093518	Isolation and characterization of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from cambium tissue of birch (Betula platyphylla Suk)	Cloning and identification of genes from the cambium of woody plants are important steps in the investigation of wood formation. In order to clone and identify the genes involved in wood formation, a cDNA library was constructed from the cambial tissue of Betula platyphylla Suk (birch). From the cDNA library, 2,878 high-quality ESTs were generated, representing 1,540 tentative unique genes (TUGs). Approximately 70% of the ESTs were matched to proteins in the NR database in GenBank and were grouped into 12 functional categories according to their functional annotation. Fifty TUGs potentially involved in wood formation, including the process of lignin biosynthesis, cell wall structure, cell wall polysaccharides synthesis or development regulation, were identified from the EST collection. The time course expression analysis of 13 wood formation related genes was further studied using RNA gel blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results showed that these genes were primarily expressed in tissue that was collected during two time periods, spring (26 April to 11 June) and later summer (30 July to 18 Sept). The bimodal expression curve of the genes indicates that both of these time periods are critical in wood formation in birch, and may be associated with cell wall expansion earlier in the year, and cell wall strengthening later in the year. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

77953517115	Involvement of Src-suppressed C kinase substrate in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis: A link between release of astrocyte proinflammatory factor and oligodendrocyte apoptosis	Src-suppressed C kinase substrate (SSeCKS) is involved in inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), and plays a role in control of cell signaling and cytoskeletal arrangement. However, the expression and function of SSeCKS and its function in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its common animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) remained to be elucidated. In the present study, we first reported that SSeCKS was remarkably increased in astrocytes of EAE rats in vivo. TNF-α and NO were significantly induced in astrocytes stimulated with LPS/IFN-γ in vitro, which was blocked in astrocytes transfected with SSeCKS siRNA. These results indicated that SSeCKS played a role in the production of TNF-α and NO in astrocytes with inflammatory stimulation. As excessive release of TNF-α and NO were major mediators in autoimmune diseases and correlated with oligodendrocyte cell death, we further investigated whether SSeCKS participated in oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Conditioned media (CM) from astrocytes treated with LPS/IFN-γ decreased oligodendrocyte cell viability, while siRNA targeted to SSeCKS in astrocytes inhibited oligodendrocyte cell death. The results from antibody neutralization and NO inhibition suggested that the oligodendrocyte apoptosis may be due to the production of astrocyte-derived proinflammatory factors (TNF-α and NO). These findings revealed that there was a pathogenic interaction between SSeCKS expression in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. Understanding the mechanism of SSeCKS in the pathogenesis of EAE may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies against EAE and MS. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Two single nucleotide polymorphisms of AKT1, IVS3+18C> T and +726G>A were genotyped in Chinese patients with pulmonary TB by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patients with pulmonary TB had significantly lower IVS3+18 C/C genotype and higher C/T genotype compared with age-, gender- and ethnically matched controls (P < 0.05). The T-A haplotype frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls ( P < 0.05).

77953742040	The expression and role of hybrid insulin/insulin-like growth factor receptor type 1 in endometrial carcinoma cells	Insulin receptor (IR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) can assemble heteromerically as a hybrid insulin/IGF-I receptor (hybrid-R) in tissues that express both molecules. There is little information about hybrid-R in endometrial carcinoma, in which both IR and IGF-IR are frequently overexpressed. We used immunoprecipitation to detect hybrid-R expression in two endometrial carcinoma cell lines: HEC-1a, which has low estrogen receptor (ER) expression, and Ishikawa, which is positive for ER expression. To explore the role of hybrid-R in endometrial carcinoma cells, we examined phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which is a key molecule in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The effect of inhibiting IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin on cell cycle progression and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Both cell lines expressed hybrid-R, and HEC-1a cells had higher expression levels than did Ishikawa cells. IGF-I induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEC-1a cells mainly through hybrid-R; in Ishikawa cells, this effect was mediated only in part by hybrid-R. Insulin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation partly through hybrid-R in HEC-1a cells, but not in Ishikawa cells. Both IGFs and insulin increased cellular DNA content in the S phase of the cell cycle in HEC-1a through hybrid-R. In contrast, in Ishikawa cells, only insulin enhanced DNA content in S phase through hybrid-R. Both IGFs and insulin significantly decreased apoptosis in HEC-1a cells through hybrid-R, and a similar but moderate effect was observed in Ishikawa cells. Hybrid-R, which is present in endometrial carcinoma cells, may have an important role in mediating IGF- and insulin-induced cell growth and in preventing apoptosis. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77954028496	Transformation of Liquidambar formosana L. via Agrobacterium tumefaciens using a mannose selection system and recovery of salt tolerant lines	A mannose selection system was adapted for use in the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Liquidambar formosana L. This system makes use of the pmi gene, which encodes phosphomannose isomerase. This protein converts mannose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. Leaf explants from an axenic plant of L. formosana L. were infected with Agrobacterium. The gene AtNHXI was transformed into L. formosana L. using the transformation procedure developed in this study. We found that supplementing the media with 1.5% (w/v) mannose and 1% sucrose provided the necessary conditions for the selection of transformed plants from non-transformed plants. In this study, 134 positive transgenic plants were obtained. Genetic transformation was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis, while RT-PCR confirmed expression of the foreign gene (AtNHX1) in the regenerated plants. Chlorophenol red assays confirmed the activity of transgenes in regenerated plants. In order to ascertain the tolerance of transformants for salt, further experimentation was done. Results showed that the soluble protein content in three transgenic lines (T-12, T-22, T-43) was higher than that in the control plant, while the MDA content was lower. Our results show that transgenic L. formosana L. plants can be obtained using either antibiotic resistance genes that are not expressed in the microorganisms or an antibiotic-free positive selection system. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The effects [odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)] of genetic polymorphisms on colorectal cancer were estimated using unconditional logistic regression. Results: The XRCC1 399Gln allele was found to be associated with a significantly increased rectal cancer risk among men (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.04-2.64). Whereas the XRCC3 241Met allele showed a protective tendency against rectal cancer (OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.02) for both men and women. Furthermore, a combination of the XRCC1 399Gln allele with XRCC3 Thr/Thr genotype and the XPD 751Gln allele demonstrated the highest rectal cancer risk (OR = 3.52, 95% CI 1.43-9.44). Conclusions: The combined effects of putative risk alleles/genotypes for different DNA repair pathways may strengthen the susceptibility to rectal cancer. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77956425477	Pollen development of dendrocalamus latiflorus and its stages	By using the techniques of aceto-carmine squash, iodine potassium iodide squash and paraffin section, an extensive and cytological observation was conducted on the pollen development of Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro. The results showed that the whole developmental process could be primarily divided into eight stages, i. e. microspore mother cell formation stage, microspore mother cell meiosis stage, early microspore stage, middle microspore stage, late microspore stage, early bicellular pollen stage, late bicellular pollen stage and mature pollen stage. The major characteristics of every stage are reported. It was showed that the cytokinesis of the microspore mother cells in meiosis was successive and the microspore tetrads were isobilateral or tetrahedral. The mature pollen grains were three-celled and mono-aperturate.

77957977162	The nuclear localization of CAPON in hippocampus and cerebral cortex neurons after lipopolysaccharide stimulation	Objective: In the brain, nitric oxide (NO) is a retrograde signalling molecule that transfers information from post- to pre-synaptic nerve endings. NO has been shown to be an important inflammatory mediator responding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It has been stated that the constitutive NO synthase isoforms (nNOS and eNOS) may also contribute to the inflammation. CAPON, a nNOS regulator, helps regulate nNOS stability, localization and possibly expression during synapse formation as well as muscle re-innervation. Recently, it has been reported that CAPON is associated with psychiatric illness. So we speculated that the CAPON expression-induced physiological changes may be mediated by modifications of NOS-NO signalling pathways. But little is known about the role of CAPON during the inflammation in the central nervous system, so we investigated the expression of CAPON in the brain treated with LPS. Methods and Results: Real-time PCR and Western blot showed that the expression of CAPON increased at mRNA and protein levels in the brain after LPS stimulation. Immunocytochemistry staining revealed that CAPON localized in the nuclei of neurons in the brain after peritoneal injection with LPS in vivo. The same phenomenon was also shown in primary cultured neurons in vitro incubated with LPS for 36 h. In addition, we found that CAPON had a colocalization with phosphorylated nNOS Ser847 but not with nNOS in hippocampus and cerebral cortex by double immunofluorescence. Conclusion: CAPON localized in the nuclei of neurons in hippocampus and cerebral cortex after LPS treatment. Because CAPON competed with PSD-95 for binding nNOS in neurons and nNOS was activated to produce NO through the NMDA-NMDAR pathway, we hypothesized that CAPON might play a proactive role in the process of inflammation by transferring from cytoplasm to the nucleus and through the NMDA-nNOS signal pathway. Further studies are required to clarify the mechanism of the nuclear localization of CAPON and the possible relationship with nNOS/NO signalling. Copyright © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

78049407607	Detection of TERC amplification in cervical epithelial cells for the diagnosis of high-grade cervical lesions and invasive cancer: A multicenter study in China	Because the activation of telomerase is a relatively early event in the progression of cervical carcinogenesis, the expression of the human telomerase RNA gene, TERC, has the potential to serve as a biomarker for both the diagnosis and prognosis of cervical neoplasias. In total, 83 research centers participated in the study, and 7786 patients were enrolled. TERC amplification was detected using a dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set, and these results were compared with cytological and histological results, testing for high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA (n = 2316 for the HPV DNA test), as well as patient age. TERC amplification was found to be increased in more advanced cases of cervical carcinogenesis. Moreover, a Youden's index value and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were also calculated for samples with TERC amplification and found to be higher than the same values calculated for both cytology and high-risk HPV analyses of the same samples. With regard to cytological ASCUS and LSIL findings, the combination of HPV + TERC testing showed the potential to provide effective triaging to detect CIN2

78149466918	B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein1 up-regulates the expression of B-cell maturation antigen in mouse plasma cells	B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein1(Blimp-1) and B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) are essential factors in the development and survival of plasma cells. However, whether Blimp-1 could regulate the expression of BCMA is unknown. We found that the BCMA promoter region did not have typical "TATA" and "CAAT" box, but contained several potential binding sites of transcription factors, including the consensus sequences for Blimp-1, located in the "-31 to -21" and "-46 to -36" from the potential transcription initiation site of the mouse BCMA gene, respectively. Furthermore, induction of Blimp-1 over-expression significantly up-regulated the expression of BCMA and increased the BCMA promoter activity in mouse J558L plasma cells. In parallel, knockdown of Blimp-1 expression by the Blimp-1-specific shRNA significantly reduced the BCMA mRNA transcription and protein expression in J558L cells in vitro. Substitution mutation of the "-38 to -42" sequence, but not the "-23 to -27", in the BCMA promoter abolished the regulatory effect of Blimp-1 on the expression of BCMA. Importantly, Blimp-1 bound to the "GAAAC", but not its mutant "GATTC", contained BCMA promoter, as determined by competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Therefore, our data clearly suggest that Blimp-s a positive regulator of the expression of BCMA gene in mouse plasma cells. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

78650766586	The role of ERK1/2 in 15-HETE-inhibited apoptosis in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells	15-Hydroxyeicosatetrenoic acid (15-HETE) is an important product of arachidonic acid catalyzed by 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) in the wall of pulmonary vessels, which plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension. The previous studies showed that 15-HETE inhibits apoptosis. It is still unknown, however, whether 15-HETE acts on the apoptotic responses through the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that ERK1/2 pathway participates in the protective effects of 15-HETE on the cell survival. This hypothesis was validated by cell viability measurement, nuclear morphology determination, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay, mitochondrial potentials assay and Western blot. We found that 15-HETE enhanced cell survival, suppressed the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten, upregulated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and Bcl-2 and attenuated mitochondrial depolarization in pulmonary artery muscle smooth cells (PASMCs) under serum-deprived conditions. These effects were reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059. Taken together, our data indicated that the ERK1/2 kinase is a regulator of PASMC apoptosis, and potential therapeutical strategy for pulmonary hypertension may be developed by targeting at intracellular signaling systems centered by the kinase. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

79251611109	Identification and Characterization of Novel MicroRNAs from Populus cathayana Rehd	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, endogenous, non-coding small RNAs of about 18-24 nucleotides in length. As negative regulators, miRNAs inhibit gene expressions at the post-transcriptional level by guiding cleavage or attenuating the translation of target genes, which affects organismal morphogenesis, development, and adaptability to changes occurring in the environment. Although miRNAs have been found in Populus species and have been shown to have diverse biological functions, few have been described in Populus cathayana Rehd. In this study, we have identified novel miRNAs from P. cathayana by constructing a library of small (18-24 nucleotides) RNA. After sequencing 691 small RNAs from P. cathayana, alignment to the Populus sequence database and secondary structure prediction were performed. These bioinformatic analyses identified five candidate miRNAs that were designated ptc-miR801, ptc-miR74, ptc-miR102, ptc-miR367, and ptc-miR213. Expression of these miRNAs was validated using real-time quantitative PCR analysis, and four of them displayed distinct expression patterns in leaves, stems, and roots. Our results show that four of the miRNAs are likely specific to leaves. Putative targets for these miRNAs play important roles in development and response to abiotic stress. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953050383	Elevated expression of Tim-3 on CD8 T cells correlates with disease severity of pulmonary tuberculosis	Objectives: T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) plays an important role in regulating T cell responses and induction of peripheral tolerance. In this study, the association of Tim-3 with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) was investigated. Methods: Tim-3 expression on CD8 T cells and its influence on production of effector molecules and proliferation of CD8 T cells were examined. Results: Pulmonary TB patients had significantly elevated Tim-3 expression on total CD8 T cells (P < 0.0001) and on antigen-specific CD8 T cells (P = 0.0028) compared with tuberculin-positive healthy controls. The expression of Tim-3 on CD8 T cells was significantly higher in smear/culture-positive TB patients than smear/culture-negative TB patients (P < 0.0001). Tim-3 expressing CD8 T cells had reduced production of IFN-γ, decreased degranulation and lower proliferation in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen stimulation. Blocking of Tim-3 signaling led to significantly increased production of IFN-γ. Conclusions: The elevated expression of Tim-3 on CD8 T cells correlates with functional defects of CD8 T cells and disease severity of pulmonary TB. © 2011 The British Infection Association.

79954461556	Modulation of T cell cytokine production by miR-144* with elevated expression in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis	microRNAs have a critical role in regulating innate and adaptive immunity. To understand whether microRNAs play roles in regulating immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in humans, microRNA expression profiling was performed in PBMCs from pulmonary tuberculosis patients and healthy controls. Analysis of expression profiles showed that expression of 30 microRNAs was significantly altered during active TB as compared with healthy controls, 28 microRNAs were up-regulated and 2 microRNAs down-regulated. miR-144* was one of the microRNAs that were overexpressed in active TB patients. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that miR-144* was mainly expressed in T cells. Transfection of T cells with miR-144* precursor demonstrated that miR-144* could inhibit TNF-α and IFN-γ production and T cell proliferation. It is concluded that miR-144* might involve in regulation of anti-TB immunity through modification of cytokine production and cell proliferation of T cells. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79955783120	γ-Secretase-mediated growth hormone receptor proteolysis: Mapping of the intramembranous cleavage site	GH receptor (GHR) undergoes regulated proteolysis by both metalloprotease (α-secretase) and γ-secretase activities. α-Secretase activity regulates GHR availability and sensitivity and generates circulating GH binding protein. The function of γ-secretase cleavage is yet uncertain. We investigated GHR determinants that affect inducible sequential α- and γ-secretase cleavage and thus remnant and stub generation, respectively. Purification and N-terminal sequencing of the stub revealed that γ-secretase cleavage occurs at an ε-site in GHR's transmembrane domain four residues from the intracellular domain. Mutagenesis revealed that deletion of the proximal two transmembrane residues prevented both α- and γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis and deletion of four residues around the ε-site precluded surface GHR expression and proteolysis. However, point mutations in and around the ε-site affected neither α- or γ-secretase cleavage. We conclude that both cleavages likely occur at the cell surface and sequentially (α-secretase followed by γ-secretase) and that ε-site cleavage by γ-secretase does not require a consensus sequence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79960305420	Analysis of genetic effects on growth traits in a 5×5 diallel cross of Betula platyphylla	Tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH) and volume of full-sib progenies were measured using a 5×5 diallel cross of four local strains of Betula platyphylla (B1, B2, B3 and B4) and one European strain of B. pendula. The results indicated that height, DBH and volume among crossing progenies differed significantly. General and specific combining ability (GCA and SCA), and reciprocal effects (REC) of the growth traits also differed significantly. Based on the estimation of growth amount, GCA, SCA and REC of crossing progenies, we selected B1, B4 and B3 as the best parent strain, female parent strain and male parent strain, respectively. For B1, its GCA for height, DBH and volume were 0.1263, 1.1367 and 0.0091, respectively. The height, DBH and volume of B1 hybrid progeny were 3.37%, 5.05% and 12.18% higher, respectively, than the average progeny performance. B1×B3, OB×B1 and B4×B3 were superior crosses in a preliminary selection. The SCA for height, DBH and volume of B1×B3 was 0.0910, 0.8080 and 0.0070, respectively. The height, DBH and volume of B1×B3 progeny were 13.11%, 21.21% and 55.76% higher, respectively, than the average progeny performance. The study provides a theoretical basis for the parent selection and the establishment of a second generation seed orchard for birch.

79961210855	Expression and gene polymorphisms of interleukin 28B and hepatitis B virus infection in a Chinese Han population	Background: Recent genome-wide association studies found that genetic polymorphisms near the IL28B gene is strongly associated with sustained viral response and spontaneous viral clearance in chronically infected hepatitis C patients. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the effects of IL28B variations on hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in a Chinese Han population and to explore the association between IL28B polymorphisms and susceptibility to infection, viral clearance, disease progression, viral load and liver inflammation. Methods: We determined three IL28B single gene polymorphisms (rs12979860, rs12980275 and rs8099917) in 203 individuals with chronic HBV infection, 203 individuals with self-limited HBV infection and 203 individuals negative for all HBV seromarkers. Interleukin (IL)28B serum levels were evaluated in all subjects. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 42 chronically HBV-infected individuals were subjected to whole-genome expression studies. Results: The association among genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies of IL28B with alanine aminotransferase levels and HBV DNA was established. However, no significant differences were observed in genotype or allele frequencies among chronically HBV-infected, self-limited and healthy subjects. The serum IL28B level was lower in patients with chronic HBV infection than in the self-limited HBV-infected or healthy subjects. The serum IL28B level was correlated with the subject's genotype. Gene expression micro-array analysis showed enhanced IL28B expression in patients with low HBV viral load. Conclusions: Variability at the IL28B locus is associated with HBV viral load and hepatic inflammation. Genetic variation of IL28B may prevent HBV progression by reducing viral load and liver inflammation, providing a valuable gene therapy tool. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

80053259914	Protein signatures for classification and prognosis of gastric cancer: A signaling pathway-based approach	Current methods have limited accuracy in predicting survival and stratifying patients with gastric cancer for appropriate treatment. We sought to identify protein signatures of gastric cancer for classification and prognostication. The Protein Pathway Array (initial study) and Western blot (confirmation) were used to assess the protein expression in a total of 199 fresh frozen gastric samples. There were 56 paired samples divided into a training set (n = 37) and a validation set (n = 19) for the identification of differentially expressed proteins between tumor and normal tissues. There were 56 tumor samples used to identify proteins correlating with tumor and nodal staging. All 93 tumor samples were used to identify candidate proteins for predicting survival. We confirmed the survival prediction of the candidate proteins by using an additional cohort of gastric cancer samples (n = 50). There were 22 proteins differentially expressed between normal and tumor tissues. Nine proteins were selected to build the predictor to classify normal and tumor samples. Ten proteins were differentially expressed among different T stages and four of these were associated with invasive behavior. An additional four proteins were associated with lymph node metastasis. Two proteins were identified as independent risk factors for overall survival. This study indicated that some dysregulated signaling proteins could be selected as useful biomarkers for tumor classification and predicting outcome in gastric cancer patients. © 2011 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

80053980050	Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava: Curative resection and synchronous reconstruction of bilateral renal veins	Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin. Surgical treatment should include complete resection of the malignant lesion with preservation of venous return. A 53-year-old woman, was referred to our hospital for recurrent upper abdominal discomfort. Computed tomography scan revealed a poorly-margined mass located between the pancreatic head and the right kidney, invading into inferior vena cava and bilateral renal veins. During surgical resection of the tumor, IVC and bilateral renal veins were clamped and the tumor was subsequently removed. The distal end of IVC was resected and venous prosthetic grafts were inserted into the proximal end and bilateral renal veins were reconstructed. Histological findings revealed leiomyosarcoma, originating from the IVC and infiltrating into bilateral renal veins. The patient has remained disease free after treatment. Though chemoradiotherapy may serve as adjuvant to surgical resection, complete surgical resection should also be recommended. © 2011 IEEE.

80255138868	Influence of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium Fertilization on Flowering and Expression of Flowering-Associated Genes in White Birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.)	Fertilization treatments can promote the growth and development of tree plants. In the present study, we evaluated the combined effects of different doses of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium on the blossoming and the expression of five flowering-associated genes, including BpMADS1, BpMADS3, BpMADS5, BpSPL1, and BpSPL2. The results showed that balanced NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) fertilization cannot only promote the transition from juvenility to maturity but also can increase the inflorescence production of white birch. Furthermore, some fertilizing treatments not only increase the expression levels of all the five flowering-associated genes, but also change their expression patterns during the growth season. These results indicated that NPK fertilization have remarkable effects on flowering of white birch. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84856702669	Hypomethylated CpG around the transcription start site enables TERT expression and HPV16 E6 regulates TERT methylation in cervical cancer cells	Objective: The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein, E6, activates telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression and causes cellular immortalization. It remains unclear whether E6 affects TERT transcription by altering DNA methylation profiles. In this study, we explored the methylation status of the TERT promoter in cervical cancer cell lines and its variations after E6 was silenced by RNAi. Methods: Three kinds of cervical cell lines (HPV16 positive: CaSki and SiHa; HPV18 positive: HeLa), were taken to analyze the methylation status of the TERT promoter by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing (BS). Stealth RNAi was transiently transfected to these cell lines to silence the expression of HPV16/18 E6, and the subsequent changes of TERT mRNA levels and TERT promoter DNA methylation were examined. Results: Hypomethylation of the DNA around the TERT transcription start site (- 156 to + 162 bp) was functionally related to its transcription. After transfection with Stealth RNAi, the levels of HPV16/18 E6 and TERT mRNA were greatly decreased. The methylated CpG around the transcription start sites in CaSki and SiHa cells were statistically increased (respectively P = 0.016, P = 0.000). However, there was no significant difference in HeLa cells (P = 0.128). Conclusion: Hypomethylated CpG around the transcription start site enables the expression of TERT in cervical cancer cells. Our results show for the first time that HPV16 E6 can promote TERT transcription through demethylating the DNA sequence around the TERT transcription start site in cervical squamous cancer cells. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84858993890	Genome-wide analysis of a TaLEA-introduced transgenic populus simonii × populus nigra dwarf mutant	A dwarf mutant (dwf1) was obtained among 15 transgenic lines, when TaLEA (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant gene) was introduced into Populus simonii × Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. Because only one transgenic line (dwf1) displayed the dwarf phenotype, we considered that T-DNA insertion sites may play a role in the mutant formation. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated using TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) and microarrays methods. According to the TAIL-PCR results, two flanking sequences located on chromosome IV and VIII respectively, were cloned. The results indicated the integration of two independent T-DNA copies. We searched for the potential genes near to the T-DNA insertions. The nearest gene was a putative poplar AP2 transcription factor (GI: 224073210). Expression analysis showed that AP2 was up-regulated in dwf1 compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. According to the microarrays results, a total of 537 genes involved in hydrolase, kinase and transcription factor activities, as well as protein and nucleotide binding, showed significant alterations in gene expression. These genes were expressed in more than 60 metabolic pathways, including starch, sucrose, galactose and glycerolipid metabolism and phenylpropanoids and flavonoid biosyntheses. Our transcriptome and T-DNA insertion sites analyses might provide some useful insights into the dwarf mutant formation. © 2012 by the authors.

84859964242	A multiple user sharing behaviors based approach for fake file detection in P2P environments	File pollution is a problem that is threatening security and availability in peer-to-peer environments, and could eventually be fatal to the survival of these systems. Current methods of fake file detection, which are based on trust mechanisms or file characteristics, do not consider the problems such as interference of multiple user sharing behaviors, the difficulty in obtaining large amounts of raw data, and malicious fraud immediately after version publication. This is the first time that differences in the sharing habits of users and particularly long retention time for individual files have been detected, which impact fake file detection. This paper proposes a pollution prevention model based on multiple user sharing behaviors, which reduces interference in multiple user sharing behaviors and malicious fraud immediately after version publication. It designs a low-cost implementation mechanism for use in structured peer-to-peer networks, which automatically collects a large amount of user file-sharing information and alleviates difficulties in obtaining large quantities of raw data. A parameter configuration is also given in this paper. Simulation experiments use realistic system logs and prove that this approach detects fake files accurately and quickly, thus decreasing download times of fake files, effectively guaranteeing almost 100% real file downloads and resisting file pollution. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

84860997024	An Isopentyl Transferase Gene Driven by the Stress-Inducible rd29A Promoter Improves Salinity Stress Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco	Soil salinity is a serious worldwide problem. To improve the salt tolerance of plants, an increasing number of genes related to abiotic stress have been recently expressed by genetic engineers. In the present study, the successful introduction into tobacco of isopentenyl transferase (IPT) from Agrobacterium tumefaciens via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is reported. A stress-inducible genetic construct was cloned using IPT under the control of the stress-inducible promoter rd29A from Arabidopsis thaliana. A total of 40 putative transgenic plant lines were obtained from independent Kan-resistant shoots. IPT integration into the tobacco genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blot analyses. Four positive transgenic lines each with a single T-DNA insertion were obtained. Real-time PCR confirmed a marked increase in IPT expression in young tobacco plants harboring rd29A-IPT after short-term exposure to salt. Ectopic IPT overexpression IPT under the control of the stress-inducible rd29A promoter resulted in significantly enhanced tolerance to salt stress. No obvious adverse effect on growth and development was observed in transgenic plants. Two IPT transgenic lines, T10 and T25, were chosen for further physiological analyses.

84861370971	IL28B genetic variation is associated with spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus, treatment response, serum IL-28B levels in Chinese population	Background: The interleukin-28B gene (IL28B) locus has been associated with host resistance to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and response to PEG-IFN/RBV treatment in western populations. This study was to determine whether this gene variant is also associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection, treatment response and IL-28B protein production in Chinese patients. Methods: We genotyped IL28B genetic variations (rs12980275, rs8103142, rs8099917 and rs12979860) by pyrosequencing DNA samples from cohorts consisting of 529 subjects with persistent HCV infection, 196 subjects who cleared the infection, 171 healthy individuals and 235 chronic HCV patients underwent IFN/RBV treatment. The expression of IL-28B were measured by ELISA and RT-PCR. Results: We found that the four IL28B variants were in complete linkage disequilibrium (r2 = 0.97-0.98). The rs12979860 CC genotype was strongly associated with spontaneously HCV clearance and successful IFN/RBV treatment compared to the CT/TT. IL-28B levels in persistent HCV patients were significantly lower than subjects who spontaneously resolved HCV and healthy controls and were also associated with high levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). IL-28B levels were also significantly lower in individuals carrying T alleles than CC homozygous. Conclusions: Thus, the rs12979860-CC variant upstream of IL28B gene is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV, susceptible to IFN/RBV treatment and increased IL-28B levels in this Chinese population. © 2012 Shi et al.

A total of 5453, 2372, and 1770 genes were shown to be differentially expressed after exposure to NaCl for 3. days, 6. days and 9. days, respectively. Differential expression patterns throughout salt stress were identified for 572 genes. Gene ontology classification analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed that numerous genes mapped to "transporter activity" and "response to stress". The dynamic transcriptome expression profiles of poplar under salt stress obtained in this study may provide useful insights for further analysis of the mechanism of high salinity tolerance in plants. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes under salt stress may allow identification of potential genes as suitable targets for biotechnological manipulation with the aim of improving poplar salt tolerance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84862754542	Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava level II involvement: curative resection and reconstruction of renal veins	Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava (IVCL) is a rare retroperitoneal tumor. We report two cases of level II (middle level, renal veins to hepatic veins) IVCL, who underwent en bloc resection with reconstruction of bilateral or left renal venous return using prosthetic grafts. In our cases, IVCL is documented to be occluded preoperatively, therefore, radical resection of tumor and/or right kidney was performed and the distal end of inferior vena cava was resected and without caval reconstruction. None of the patients developed edema or acute renal failure postoperatively. After surgical resection, adjuvant radiation therapy was administrated. The patients have been free of recurrence 2 years and 3 months, 9 months after surgery, respectively, indicating the complete surgical resection and radiotherapy contribute to the better survival. The reconstruction of inferior vena cava was not considered mandatory in level II IVCL, if the retroperitoneal venous collateral pathways have been established. In addition to the curative resection of IVCL, the renal vascular reconstruction minimized the risks of procedure-related acute renal failure, and was more physiologically preferable. This concept was reflected in the treatment of the two patients reported on. © 2012 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central.

The cDNA was subcloned in bacterial expression vector pET28a and expressed as N-terminal histidine tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli (Rosetta gami). After induction with IPTG, a molecular weight of 42 kDa fusion protein was obtained and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. New Zealand white rabbit was immunized with the purified ThPOD1 protein and the antiserum was obtained. Western blot analyses showed that, the antibody reacted specifically to recombinant ThPOD1 protein. Therefore, the antibody was applied to detect expression of ThPOD1 protein in T. hispida, which was treated with 20% PEG and 100 μM ABA, respectively. All treatments induced an increase in protein level of the ThPOD1 gene, especially the expression levels of ThPOD1 in roots were obviously higher than in leaves. This work established a good foundation for further study on the specific function of ThPOD1 under the condition of abiotic stress. © 2012 Academic Journals.

84863253579	Different expression patterns of heart and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein gene during porcine skeletal muscle development	The pig FABP3 (heart Fatty Acid-Binding Protein) and FABP4 (adipocyte Fatty Acid-Binding Protein) genes play an important role in intracellular fatty acid transport and considered to be candidate genes for Intramuscular Fat content (IMF) trait in pigs. In this study, the expression profiling of FABP3 and FABP4 genes was investigated in two pig breeds differing in muscularity (Yorkshire and Meishan) at four stages (fetal 65 days and postnatal 3, 60 and 120 days). The expression of FABP3 and FABP4 was significantly different in porcine skeletal muscle among different developmental stages and between the two breeds. This result suggests that the pig FABP3 and FABP4 may be important genes for meat quality and provides useful information for further studies on their roles in skeletal muscle intramuscular fat deposit. © Medwell Journals, 2012.

84863661971	Association of polymorphism of PTPN 11 encoding SHP-2 with gastric atrophy but not gastric cancer in Helicobacter pylori seropositive Chinese population	Background: The interaction between Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) of gastric epithelial cells and cagA from H. pylori plays a crucial role in developments of gastric atrophy and gastric cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association of haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the PTPN11 gene encoding SHP-2 with gastric atrophy and gastric cancer in Chinese population.Methods: The subjects comprised 414 patients with gastric cancer, 109 individuals with gastric atrophy and 923 healthy controls. Blood was collected from October 2008 to October 2010. Five htSNPs rs2301756, rs12423190, rs12229892, rs7958372 and rs4767860 from the PTPN11 gene were selected and genotyped by Taqman assay. Serum Ig G antibodies to H. pylori were detected by ELISA. Gastric atrophy was screened by the levels of serum pepsinogenIandII, and confirmed by endoscopy and histopatholgical examinations. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by a multivariate logistic regression.Results: Among H. pylori seropositive subjects, age and gender-adjusted OR of gastric atrophy was 2.47 (95%CI 1.13-4.55, P = 0.02) for CC genotype compared with CT/TT genotypes, suggesting a recessive model of genetic risk for rs12423190. The prevalence of H. pylori seropositivity were significantly higher in groups of gastric cancer and gastric atrophy compared to the control group (70.3% vs. 75.2% vs. 49.7%, P <0.001). However, the distributions of genotypes and haplotypes in patients with gastric cancer were not significantly different from healthy controls.Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence that rs12423190 polymorphism of the PTPN11 gene is significantly associated with an increased risk of gastric atrophy in H. pylori infected Chinese Han population, suggesting that rs12423190 polymorphism could be used as a useful marker of genetic susceptibility to gastric atrophy among H. pylori infected subjects. The biological roles of this polymorphism require a further investigation. © 2012 Jiang et al. licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84864088023	Oak stand description factors and risk assessment of harm extent of Massicus raddei (coleoptera: cerambycidae)	Thirteen stand description factors affecting the harm extent of Massicus raddei was studied, and by stepwise regression analysis, three key factors, slope position, DBH and crown density, were selected. The results showed that there was a significant negative correlation between the crown density and the ratio of infected oaks, and a significant positive correlation existed between the other two key factors and the ratio of infected oaks. Using these three key factors, a multiple regression model was established for risk analysis of the harm extent of Massicus raddei. The average difference degree was 0.1742, so the model is suitable for risk assessment of the harm extent of the pest.

84864281039	A label-free differential quantitative proteomics analysis of a TaLEA-introduced transgenic Populus simonii × Populus nigra dwarf mutant	TaLEA (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant gene, DQ663481) gene was introduced into Populus simonii × Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tum-efaciens-mediated transformation with the aim of improving salt-tolerance. Among the 15 transgenic lines, one showed a dwarf phenotype (dwf1). Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type and the other transgenic lines. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated in mutant and wild-type plants using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Among proteins that identified, 99 were significantly altered. With the exception of proteins with unidentified or unclassified functions, these proteins were classified into eight groups based on gene product subcellular localization and biological process (metabolism, stress, protein synthesis and degradation, transcrip-tional regulation, cell fate, transportation, cell wall, and cytoskeleton). Differential expression patterns were identified for key enzymes involved in major metabolic pathways such as the Calvin cycle and glycolysis, thus indicating the interplay of complex molecular events in generation of the dwf1 mutant. Overall, the differentially expressed proteins in dwf1 might provide some useful insights into the dwarf formation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84865124891	Expression profile of miRNAs in Populus cathayana L. and Salix matsudana Koidz under salt stress	Soil salinization can lead to environmental and ecological problems worldwide. Abiotic stressors, including salinity, are suspected to regulate microRNA (miRNA) expression. Plants exposed to such abiotic stressors express specific miRNAs, which are genes encoding small non-coding RNAs of 20-24 nucleotides. miRNAs are known to exist widely in plant genomes, and are endogenous. A previous study used miRNA microarray technology and poly(A) polymerase-mediated qRT-PCR technology to analyze the expression profile of miRNAs in two types of plants, Populus cathayana L. (salt-sensitive plants) and Salix matsudana Koidz (highly salinity-tolerant plants), both belonging to the Salicaceae family. miRNA microarray hybridization revealed changes in expression of 161 miRNAs P. cathayana and 32 miRNAs in S. matsudana under salt stress. Differences in expression indicate that the same miRNA has different expression patterns in salt-sensitive plants and salt-tolerant plants under salt stress. These indicate that changes in expression of miRNAs might function as a response to varying salt concentrations. To examine this, we used qRT-PCR to select five miRNA family target genes involved in plant responses to salt stress. Upon saline treatment, the expressions of both ptc-miR474c and ptc-miR398b in P. cathayana were down-regulated, but were up-regulated in S. matsudana. Expression of the miR396 family in both types of plants was suppressed. Furthermore, we have analyzed the different expression patterns between P. cathayana and S. matsudana. Findings of this study can be utilized in future investigations of post-transcriptional gene regulation in P. cathayana and S. matsudana under saline stress. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84864354816	Effectiveness of fast-track rehabilitation vs conventional care in laparoscopic colorectal resection for elderly patients: A randomized trial	Aim The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fast-track rehabilitation in elderly patients over 65years of age, following laparoscopic surgery to remove colorectal cancer. Method A total of 78 elderly patients with colorectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic colorectal resection were randomly assigned to receive either the fast-track care programme (n=40) or the conventional perioperative care protocol (control group, n=38). Medical personnel conducting the study were blinded to patients' clinical outcomes prior to statistical analysis. The fast-track protocol included no preoperative mechanical bowel irrigation, immediate oral alimentation and earlier postoperative ambulation exercise. The length of postoperative hospital stay, the length of time to regain bowel function and the rate of postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. Results The length of time to regain bowel function, including the passage of flatus[31(26-40)h vs 38(32-51)h, P=0.001], to the first bowel movement [55(48-63)h vs 64(48-71)h, P=0.009] and to start a liquid diet (12[11-16]h vs 47[35-50]h, P=0.000) were significantly shorter in patients receiving the fast-track care protocol compared with those receiving the conventional care protocol. A shorter duration of postoperative hospital stay was recorded in patients receiving the fast-track program than in those receiving conventional care (P=0.0001). A reduced percentage of patients who developed general complications was also observed in the fast-track group (5.0%vs 21.1%, P=0.045). Conclusion This randomized controlled trial has shown that in the elderly undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery, the fast-track recovery programme resulted in a more rapid postoperative recovery, earlier discharge from hospital and fewer general complications compared with a conventional postoperative protocol. © 2011 The Authors.

84865267997	Seed vigor, photosynthesis and early growth of saplings of different triploid Betula families	Breeding scientists have given extensive attention to triploids in trees because of their importance to forestry. Consequently, creating and breeding triploids of good quality has become one of purposes of tree breeding. We chose two autotetraploids (Betula platyphylla, namedQ10 andQ65) as female parents andeight hybrid diploids (B. platyphylla × B. pendula, namedF1 - F8) as male parents to obtain progenies through controllable pollination, resulting in triploidprogenies. Germination rate andgermination energy of triploid seeds of Q65 were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in triploidseed s of Q10. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent hada large quantity of saplings, whereas triploidfamilies with Q10 as female parent hada small quantity of saplings. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent were generally superior in base diameter and height to base diameter ratio when compared to a diploid family. Q65×F3 was preliminarily recognized as the superior family. These results demonstrate that the female parent has a major influence on triploid progenies, although the male parent also has a small influence. The results provided a reference to build seed orchards of triploid birch trees, choose tetraploids as female parents and forecast triploid families of good quality.

0037743885	Association of GSTM1, CYP1A1 and CYP2E1 genetic polymorphism with susceptibility to lung adenocarcinoma: A case-control study in Chinese population	A case-control study of 164 lung adenocarcinoma (AC) patients with 181 age- and gender-matched healthy controls was conducted in order to assess any associations between glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1), cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) and cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) polymorphisms and susceptibility to lung AC in Chinese. The presence of CYP2E1 variant allele was significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while the distribution of GSTM1 null genotype and variant CYP1A1 Msp1 al- lele did not vary between cases and controls. After adjustment for age, gender, smoking and all other genotypes, the CYP2E1 Rsa1 variant allele was significantly associated with decreased risk of lung AC [odds ratio 0.534 (95% confidence interval, 0.340-0.837)]. Furthermore, 3.0-fold increased risk was found in individuals with combined GSTM1 null genotype and CYP2E1 Rsa1 wild type versus those with combined GSTM1 non-null type and CYP2E1 variant allele. Our results suggest that CYP2E1 Rsa1 variant allele is associated with a decreased risk of lung AC, and combined GSTM1 null genotype and CYP2E1 Rsa1 wild type has a promoting effect on susceptibility to lung AC.

84867950087	Growth traits of triploid progenies in one year old from different crosses of Betula platyphylla Suk	Triploid progenies of 20 crosses were obtained by controlled-pollination using four autotetraploid Betula platyphylla (Q14, Q19, Q33 and Q34) as female and five diploid hybrid B. platyphylla × B. pendula (Ml, M2, M3, M4 and M5) as male and tested in a nursery. This paper presents early growth measurements and the results indicat that cross had a significant effect on height and base diameter growth. Variances of general combining ability and specific combining ability for both height and base diameter were significantly different from zero. Based on the results of growth, general combining ability and specific combining ability, two autotetraploids (Q19 and Q34) were identified as good female parents, two diploid hybrids (M1 and M2) as male parents, and Q34 × M2 and Q34 × M1 as the best crosses.

84867783535	Transcriptomic analysis of phenotypic changes in birch (Betula platyphylla) autotetraploids	Plant breeders have focused much attention on polyploid trees because of their importance to forestry. To evaluate the impact of intraspecies genome duplication on the transcriptome, a series of Betula platyphylla autotetraploids and diploids were generated from four full-sib families. The phenotypes and transcriptomes of these autotetraploid individuals were compared with those of diploid trees. Autotetraploids were generally superior in breast-height diameter, volume, leaf, fruit and stoma and were generally inferior in height compared to diploids. Transcriptome data revealed numerous changes in gene expression attributable to autotetraploidization, which resulted in the upregulation of 7052 unigenes and the downregulation of 3658 unigenes. Pathway analysis revealed that the biosynthesis and signal transduction of indoleacetate (IAA) and ethylene were altered after genome duplication, which may have contributed to phenotypic changes. These results shed light on variations in birch autotetraploidization and help identify important genes for the genetic engineering of birch trees. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84872154265	Characteristics of the staminate flower and pollen from autotetraploid Betula platyphylla	Comparison of the staminate flower and pollen of Betula platyphylla between autotetraploid and diploid individuals may reveal the reason for cross sterility when an autotetraploid male parent is crossed with a diploid female parent. Staminate flowers and pollen from seven autotetraploid individual trees were examined. The morphologies of the staminate flower and pollen and pollen germination of these autotetraploid individuals were compared with diploid trees. The structure of the staminate flower did not differ between autotetraploids and diploids, whereas the size of the staminate flower was larger in the autotetraploids compared with the diploids. The mean diameter and pore depth of the pollen were significantly larger in autotetraploid individuals compared with diploids, and several abnormalities in pollen morphology were found commonly amongst pollen from the autotetraploid trees. The germination rate of pollen from autotetraploids was significantly inferior to that of diploids and there was a significant negative correlation between germination rate and the percentage of abnormal pollen. These results demonstrate that the autotetraploid should not be chosen as the male parent to obtain hybrid triploid progenies because the pollen is abnormal and results in low fertility despite its large size. The results provide important information for selecting and distributing parent strains with the aim of building seed orchards of triploid birch trees.

84872234696	Association of HLA-DRB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms with left ventricular remodelling in elderly patients with essential hypertension	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between human leucocyte antigen DRβ1 (HLA-DRB1) gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular remodelling (left ventricular dilatation [LVD]) in Han Chinese patients ≥ 60 years old, with essential hypertension. METHODS: LVD was diagnosed via echocardiographic measurements. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction-ligase detection reaction was used to determine the genotypes of three HLA-DRB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2308765, rs9269186 and rs3135388). RESULTS: HLADRB1 rs2308765 wild-type (G) allele and genotype (GG) were associated with decreased risk of LVD. HLA-DRB1 rs9269186 and rs3135388 were not associated with LVD risk. Mean waist and abdominal circumferences were significantly larger in patients with, compared with those without, LVD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses found that rs2308765 was associated with LVD (GT + TT versus GG; odds ratio 7.958; 95% confidence interval 1.935, 32.723). CONCLUSIONS: Mutation in HLA-DRB1 rs2308765 was associated with increased risk of LVD in elderly patients with hypertension. Genotype analysis may allow identification of patients at high risk of cardiovascular events such LVD. © SAGE Publications Ltd 2012.

84872260766	Population-keeping mechanism of the parasitoid dastarcus helophoroides (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) of massicus raddei (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in oak forest	Dastarcus helophoroides (Fairmaire) (Coleoptera: Bothrideridae) is an important parasitoid of the oak longhorn beetle Massicus raddei (Blessig) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in China. It had a long developmental period needing three years to finish a generation and its generation showed uniformity. The biological character generally was unfavored for its insect natural enemies to maintain relative stable high populations. In order to understand whether the population of the parasitoid D. helophoroides could keep its high level in forests of oak trees (Quercus liaotungenesis Koidz and Q. mongolica Fischer) or not after its releasing in forests, we investigated its potential alternative hosts in northeastern China oak forests. It was found that there were eight species of longhorn beetle species living in the east-Liaoning oak forests besides M. raddei attacking the oak trees. The numbers of four species of the longhorn beetles were predominant in oak forests, i. e. M. raddei, Moechotypa diphysis (Pascoe), Masosa myops Dalman, Stenygrinum quadrinotatum Bates. However, the vertical distributions of M. raddei, M. diphysis and M. myops on the oak trunk appeared as overlapping with the parasitoid D. helophoroides. The inoculating tests indoor indicated that the relative high parasitism rates occured in both hosts of M. myops and M. diphysis, in the former with parasitism rate 26. 67% on the last instar larval stage and 43. 33% on the pupal stage, and in the latter with 20. 00% on last instar larval stage and 6. 67% on the pupal stage. The biological observations of M. myops and M. diphysis in forests indicated that the mature larvae of the two cerambycid species existed always in a year during the unfavorable parasitism periods of D. helophoroides on M. raddei, i. e. egg and young larval stages of M. raddei (prior 3rd instar), for the parasitoid to parasitize and to maintain its high population, as well as that the two cerambycid species were the principal alternative hosts of D. helophoroides in north eastern China oak forests. The results of the present study showed evidence of that the biological control program to apply the parasitoid D. helophoroides could reach effective and sustainable control efficiency for the severe damaged wood borer M. raddei after the parasitoid was released. By parasitizing mature larvae of M. diphysis, M. myops and other six species of cerembycids attacking oaks as alternative hosts D. helophoroides could keep its relative high population, and when the proper larval stage of M. raddei (i. e. over third instar larval stage and pupal stage) for its parasitizing occurred, it then could move to the main host, M. raddei, for parasitizing. Thus, the parasitoid has a high potential as an excellent natural enemy to be used in biocontrol program to make the cerambycid under control.

84872665626	Transgenic poplar "NL895" expressing CpFATB gene shows enhanced tolerance to drought stress	Acyl-ACP thioesterases are responsible for the export of fatty acids produced by the de novo fatty acid synthesis system from the plastid. A fatty acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterase (CpFATB) was isolated from a Chimonanthuspraecox (linn.) Link. (wintersweet) cDNA library. This gene was subsequently transferred into Populusdeltoides CL × P. euramericanaCL "NL895" through Agrobacteriumtumefaciens-mediated leaf disc transformation. The transgenic plants were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Southern hybridization. Three positive transgenic lines each with a single T-DNA insertion were obtained. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) confirmed CpFATB expression in transformed plants after short-term exposure to drought. When exposed to drought stress, transgenic plants showed higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, peroxidase (POD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, chlorophyll a content, chlorophyll b content and total chlorophyll content compared with untransformed plants. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, electric conductivity and net photosynthetic rate of the transgenic plants were lower than untransgenic plants. The results of physiological indices showed that the overexpression of CpFATB in plants exhibited higher drought stress tolerance under drought stress condition compared to the untransformed control plants. Our data further confirmed and highlighted the functions of CpFATB in enhancing plants drought tolerance and may provide a plausible approach to breed plants combating drought stress and enlarging living scope. © 2012 Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.

Quantitative analysis of relative expression of the AP2/PthRAV lines in dwf1 was significantly higher than other transgenic lines, at 7.78 times of the average. A preliminary view of dwf1 lines in the change of growth and anatomical structure of leaf traits may be related to the up-regulation of AP2/PthRAV genes.

84873682821	Increased expression of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in Helicobacter pylori -infected gastric cancer	AIM: To explore the alteration of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 protein expression in gastric cancer and to assess its prognostic values. METHODS: Three hundred and five consecutive cases of gastric cancer were enrolled into this study. SHP-2 expression was carried out in 305 gastric cancer specimens, of which 83 were paired adjacent normal gastric mucus samples, using a tissue microarray immunohistochemical method. Correlations were analyzed between expression levels of SHP-2 protein and tumor parameters parameters or clinical outcomes. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G was detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate prognostic values by compassion of the expression levels of SHP-2 and disease-specific survivals in patients. RESULTS: SHP-2 staining was found diffuse mainly in the cytoplasm and the weak staining was also observed in the nucleus in gastric mucosa cells. Thirty-two point five percent of normal epithelial specimen and 62.6% of gastric cancer specimen were identified to stain with SHP-2 antibody positively (P < 0.001). Though SHP-2 staining intensities were stronger in the H. pylori (+) group than in the H. pylori (-) group, no statistically significant difference was found in the expression levels of SHP-2 between H. pylori (+) and H. pylori (-) gastric cancer (P = 0.40). The SHP-2 expression in gastric cancer was not significantly associated with cancer stages, lymph node metastases, and distant metastasis of the tumors (P = 0.34, P = 0.17, P = 0.52). Multivariate analysis demonstrated no correlation between SHP-2 expression and disease-free survival (P = 0.86). CONCLUSION: Increased expression of SHP-2 protein in gastric cancer specimen suggesting the aberrant upregulation of SHP-2 protein might play an important role in the gastric carcinogenesis. © 2013 Baishideng.

84873995296	Protein predictive signatures for lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer	Lymph node status remains one of most crucial indicators of gastric cancer prognosis and treatment planning. Current imaging methods have limited accuracy in predicting lymph node metastasis. We sought to identify protein markers in primary gastric cancer and to define a risk model to predict lymph node metastasis. The Protein Pathway Array (PPA) (initial selection) and Western blot (confirmation) were used to assess the protein expression in a total of 190 freshly frozen gastric cancer samples. The protein expression levels were compared between samples with lymph node metastasis (n = 73) and those without lymph node metastasis (n = 57) using PPA. There were 27 proteins differentially expressed between lymph node positive samples and lymph node negative samples. Five proteins (Factor XIII B, TFIIH p89, ADAM8, COX-2 and CUL-1) were identified as independent predictors of lymph node metastasis. Together with vascular/lymphatic invasion status, a risk score model was established to determine the risk of lymph node metastasis for each individual gastric cancer patient. The ability of this model to predict lymph node metastasis was further confirmed in a second cohort of gastric cancer patients (33 with and 27 without lymph node metastasis) using Western blot. This study indicated that some proteins differentially expressed in gastric cancer can be selected as clinically useful biomarkers. The risk score model is useful for determining patients' risk of lymph node metastasis and prognosis. What's new? While lymph node status remains one of the most crucial indicators of gastric cancer prognosis and treatment planning, current imaging methods have limited accuracy in predicting lymph node metastasis. Here the authors identified dysregulated signaling proteins allowing the classification and prognosis of lymph node metastasis in gastric cancers, supporting the hypothesis that dysregulation of signaling proteins is unique in each cancer and can be used as a signature. The incorporation of these proteins into the clinicopathologic assessment of gastric cancers has the potential to improve the assessment of lymph node metastasis and personalized management of patients.

84874026295	Qualitative and quantitative expression status of the human chromosome 20 genes in cancer tissues and the representative cell lines	Under the guidance of the Chromosome-centric Human Proteome Project (C-HPP),1,2 we conducted a systematic survey of the expression status of genes located at human chromosome 20 (Chr.20) in three cancer tissues, gastric, colon, and liver carcinoma, and their representative cell lines. We have globally profiled proteomes in these samples with combined technology of LC-MS/MS and acquired the corresponding mRNA information upon RNA-seq and RNAchip. In total, 323 unique proteins were identified, covering 60% of the coding genes (323/547) in Chr.20. With regards to qualitative information of proteomics, we overall evaluated the correlation of the identified Chr.20 proteins with target genes of transcription factors or of microRNA, conserved genes and cancer-related genes. As for quantitative information, the expression abundances of Chr.20 genes were found to be almost consistent in both tissues and cell lines of mRNA in all individual chromosome regions, whereas those of Chr.20 proteins in cells are different from tissues, especially in the region of 20q13.33. Furthermore, the abundances of Chr.20 proteins were hierarchically evaluated according to tissue-or cancer-related distribution. The analysis revealed several cancer-related proteins in Chr.20 are tissue-or cell-type dependent. With integration of all the acquired data, for the first time we established a solid database of the Chr.20 proteome. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84874083098	First proteomic exploration of protein-encoding genes on chromosome 1 in human liver, stomach, and colon	The launch of the Chromosome-Centric Human Proteome Project provides an opportunity to gain insight into the human proteome. The Chinese Human Chromosome Proteome Consortium has initiated proteomic exploration of protein-encoding genes on human chromosomes 1, 8, and 20. Collaboration within the consortium has generated a comprehensive proteome data set using normal and carcinomatous tissues from human liver, stomach, and colon and 13 cell lines originating in these organs. We identified 12,101 proteins (59.8% coverage against Swiss-Prot human entries) with a protein false discovery rate of less than 1%. On chromosome 1, 1,252 proteins mapping to 1,227 genes, representing 60.9% of Swiss-Prot entries, were identified; however, 805 proteins remain unidentified, suggesting that analysis of more diverse samples using more advanced proteomic technologies is required. Genes encoding the unidentified proteins were concentrated in seven blocks, located at p36, q12-21, and q42-44, partly consistent with correlation of these blocks with cancers of the liver, stomach, and colon. Combined transcriptome, proteome, and cofunctionality analyses confirmed 23 coexpression clusters containing 165 genes. Biological information, including chromosome structure, GC content, and protein coexpression pattern was analyzed using multilayered, circular visualization and tabular visualization.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of canolol on the proliferation and apoptosis of SGC-7901 human gastric cancer cells and its relevant molecular mechanisms. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to observe the effect of canolol on the proliferation of SGC-7901 human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. The results showed that SGC-7901 cells exhibited a marked dose-dependent reduction in the proliferation rate. The survival rate of the cells was 88.86±1.58% at 50 μmol/l, decreasing to 53.73±1.51% at 800 μmol/l (P<0.05). By contrast, canolol had no significant toxicity on the human gastric mucosal epithelial cell line GES-1. The vivid images of cell morphology using an inverted microscope provided confirmation of the MTT assay. Treatment of SGC-7901 cells with canolol resulted in apoptosis demonstrated by flow cytometry. Furthermore, canolol downregulated the mRNA levels of COX-2, but had no significant effect on the mRNA expession of the Bax and Bcl-2 genes. These findings suggest that canolol has potential to be developed as a new natural anti-gastric carcinoma agent.

84875471105	Variation and growth adaptability analysis of transgenic Populus simonii × P. nigra lines carrying TaLEA gene	A totlal of 12 Populus simonii × P. nigra lines (11 transgenic Populus lines and one control line) in 2 years old were used to study the phenotypic variation of tree height(H) and basic diameter(BD) in 6 different sites. The analysis of variance showed that there was a remarkable difference in H and BD among sites (P < 0.01), lines (P < 0.01), and sites × lines (P < 0.05). The average H and BD of transgenic poplar lines ranged in 128-235 cm and 13-24 mm in different sites respectively. The coefficients of H and BD of transgenic poplar lines changed in 19.84%-33.38% and 24.21%-49.16% and repeatabilities ranged in 0.497-0.952, indicating that the variation of poplar transgenic lines was strongly controlled by genetic factors, which were in favor of line selection. Tai model was introduced to analyse the genetic adaptability of poplar lines in different sites. The results showed that except line XL11, other lines grew steady in different sites. Based on the genetic adaptability parameter and the domino effect values of interaction between H and environment, the most adapted site of each line was predicted. Lines XL9, XL1 and XL14 are high biomass and strong stability, which are suitable generalized in 6 different sites.

84877624447	Polymorphisms of PTPN11 gene could influence serum lipid levels in a sex-specific pattern	Background: Previous studies have reported that different genotypes of PTPN11 gene (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor 11) were associated with different levels of serum lipids. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PTPN11 and serum lipids in Northeast Chinese. Methods. A total of 1003 subjects, 584 males and 419 females, were included in the study and their serum lipids were determined. Five htSNPs (rs2301756, rs12423190, rs12229892, rs7958372 and rs4767860) of PTPN11 gene were genotyped using TaqMan assay method. Results: All of the five SNPs were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The male subjects had higher triglyceride (TG), higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level than females. In males, rs4767860 was found to be associated with serum TG and total cholesterol (TC) levels and rs12229892 was associated with TC level. However, these significant associations could not be observed in females. In females, rs2301756 was found to be associated with TG and rs7958372 was associated with LDL-C level. Haplotype analysis showed that the GCGTG haplotype was associated with slightly higher TG level and ATGCG with higher TC level. Conclusions: SNPs of PTPN11 may play a role in serum lipids in a sex-specific pattern. However, more studies are needed to confirm the conclusion and explore the underlying mechanism. © 2013 Jia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878073013	Inducing tetraploid of Betula platyphylla with different generations of seeds by colchicine	The effects of colchicine treatments on relative-germination rate and potential of seeds for four Betula platyphylla families were studied. The treatment combinations included the colchicine concentration of 0.1% and 0.2% and the treatment time of 1 day, 2, 3 and 4 days. Based on the results of first experiment, the second one was further to investigate the inducing rate of tetraploid after applying the treatment combination of 0.2% and 3 days on 7 families of two species, B. platyphylla × B. pendula and B. pendula. Results of the first experiment showed that the colchicine concentration had a significant influence on seed relative-germination rate and potential; the germinate rate was lower and potential was weaker at the concentration of 0.2% than at 0.1%. Under the same concentration, the relative-germination rate and potential reduced first then enhanced along with the increase of treating time. The treating time of 3 days had the lowest germinate rate and potential. Results of the second experiment showed that the tetraploid inducing rate was significantly different between the species and among the families within species. The average inducing rate was 3.76% for the four B. pendula families but was only 0.09% for the three hybrid families. The highest rate was 8.86% for YB3.

84879795571	Comparison and optimization of strategies for a more profound profiling of the sialylated N-glycoproteomics in human plasma using metal oxide enrichment	Glycosylation is an important posttranslational modification of proteins and plays a crucial role in both cellular functions and secretory pathways. Sialic acids (SAs), a family of nine-carbon-containing acidic monosaccharides, often terminate the glycan structures of cell surface molecules and secreted glycoproteins and perform an important role in many biological processes. Hence, a more profound profiling of the sialylated glycoproteomics may improve our knowledge of this modification and its effects on protein functions. Here, we systematically investigated different strategies to enrich the SA proteins in human plasma using a newly developed technology that utilizes titanium dioxide for sialylated N-glycoproteomics profiling by mass spectrometry. Our results showed that using a combination of a filter-aided sample preparation method, TiO

In this study, B. pendula 'Purple Rain' was found to have a higher anthocyanidin level compared with B. pendula, Transcriptome analysis revealed numerous changes in gene expression that could be attributed to color change, including the upregulation of 2467 unigenes and the downregulation of 2299 unigenes in 'Purple Rain'. Furthermore, anthocyanidin synthesis and transcriptional regulation were altered in 'Purple Rain', which may have contributed to phenotypic changes.

84882625898	Serum pepsinogen II is a better diagnostic marker in gastric cancer	AIM: To investigate screening makers for gastric cancer, we assessed the association between gastric cancer and serum pepsinogens (PGs). METHODS: The subjects comprised 450 patients with gastric cancer, 111 individuals with gastric atrophy, and 961 healthy controls. Serum anti-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) immunoglobulin G (IgG), PGIand PG IIwere detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Gastric atrophy and gastric cancer were diagnosed by endoscopy and histopathological examinations. Odds ratios and 95%CIs were calculated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Rates of H. pylori infection remained high in Northeastern China. Rates of H. pylori IgG positivity were greater in the gastric cancer and gastric atrophy groups compared to the control group (69.1% and 75.7% vs 49.7%, P < 0.001). Higher levels of PG II(15.9 μg/L and 13.9 μg/L vs 11.5 μg/L, P < 0.001) and lower PGI/ PG IIratio (5.4 and 4.6 vs 8.4, P < 0.001) were found in patients with gastric cancer or gastric atrophy compared to healthy controls, whereas no correlation was found between the plasma PGIconcentration and risk of gastric cancer (P = 0.537). In addition, multivariate logistic analysis indicated that H. pylori infection and atrophic gastritis were independent risk factors for gastric cancer. Lower plasma PGI/PG IIratio was associated with higher risks of atrophy and gastric cancer. Furthermore, plasma PG IIlevel significantly correlated with H. pylori-infected gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: Serum PG IIconcentration and PG I/PG IIratio are potential biomarkers for H. pylori-infected gastric disease. PG IIis independently associated with risk of gastric cancer. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84881512269	Multi-slice CT angiography in acute suspected mesenteric ischemia: Role in diagnosis and differential diagnosis	Aim of this study is to assess the role of multi-slice CT angiography (MSCTA) in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI). MSCTA was performed on 27 patients who presented with the clinical suspicion of AMI (16M; 11F, age range: 35-70 years). Reconstructed images using minimum intensity projection, volume rendering and multiplanar volume reconstruction were found to perform better for the detection of vascular abnormalities and improved the diagnostic confidence of both radiologists in the evaluation of bowel and mesenteric abnormalities. Axial and 3D reconstructed images of patients were evaluated independently by two radiologists. AMI was correctly diagnosed in 26/27 patients on MSCTA (97.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity) of whom nine patients underwent surgical exploration.

84881093655	A fast workflow for identification and quantification of proteomes	The current in-depth proteomics makes use of long chromatography gradient to get access to more peptides for protein identification, resulting in covering of as many as 8000 mammalian gene products in 3 days of mass spectrometer running time. Here we report a fast sequencing (Fast-seq) workflow of the use of dual reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) with a short gradient to achieve the same proteome coverage in 0.5 day. We adapted this workflow to a quantitative version (Fast quantification, Fast-quan) that was compatible to large-scale protein quantification. We subjected two identical samples to the Fast-quan workflow, which allowed us to systematically evaluate different parameters that impact the sensitivity and accuracy of the workflow. Using the statistics of significant test, we unraveled the existence of substantial falsely quantified differential proteins and estimated correlation of false quantification rate and parameters that are applied in label-free quantification. We optimized the setting of parameters that may substantially minimize the rate of falsely quantified differential proteins, and further applied them on a real biological process. With improved efficiency and throughput, we expect that the Fast-seq/Fast-quan workflow, allowing pair wise comparison of two proteomes in 1 day may make MS available to the masses and impact biomedical research in a positive way. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84883054662	Expression patterns of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 versus gamma 2, and their association with intramuscular fat in goat tissues	Intramuscular fat (IMF) shortage causes the lack of juiciness and tenderness of goat meat, while peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 ( PPARγ1) and gamma 2 ( PPARγ2) play key roles in lipid metabolism. Nevertheless, their expression patterns and the relationship with IMF have been poorly exposed. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), classical Soxhlet extraction, and in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that among 13 goat tissues, expression of PPARγ1 was dramatically higher than that of PPARγ2 except for lung. We further demonstrated the expression patterns of PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 and their negative association with intramuscular fat content in three goat muscles with kids growing. Meanwhile, PPARγ expression was located in the connective tissues. These results suggest that PPARγ1 is rather active for most tissues of goat, and closely related with the muscular fat metabolism during early postnatal life, but a more direct proof remains to be provided. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885419870	Transcriptomic analysis of incised leaf-shape determination in birch	Plant researchers have focused much attention on leaf shape because of its importance in the identification. To evaluate the impact of intraspecies leaf-shape variation on the transcriptome, a series of Betula pendula 'Dalecarlica' and B. pendula saplings were generated through tissue culture. The leaf shapes and transcriptomes of B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' clones were compared with those of B. pendula clones. The leaf shape of B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' was incised and that of B. pendula was ovate. Transcriptome data revealed numerous changes in gene expression between B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' and B. pendula, including upregulation of 8767 unigenes and downregulation of 8379 unigenes in B. pendula 'Dalecarlica'. A pathway analysis revealed that the transport and signal transduction of auxin were altered in 'Dalecarlica', which may have contributed to its altered leaf shape. These results shed light on variation in birch leaf shape and help identify important genes for the genetic engineering of birch trees. © 2013.

84886301150	miR-582-5p Is Upregulated in Patients with Active Tuberculosis and Inhibits Apoptosis of Monocytes by Targeting FOXO1	Macrophage apoptosis is a host innate defense mechanism against tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we found that percentage of apoptotic cells in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with active TB was lower than that from healthy controls (p<0.001). To understand whether microRNAs can modulate apoptosis of monocytes, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs in patients with active TB. miR-582-5p was mainly expressed in monocytes and was upregulated in patients with active TB. The apoptotic percentage of THP-1 cells transfected with miR-582-5p mimics was significantly lower than those transfected with negative control of microRNA mimics (p<0.001), suggesting that miR-582-5p could inhibit apoptosis of monocytes. To our knowledge, the role of miR-582-5p in regulating apoptosis of monocytes has not been reported so far. Systematic bioinformatics analysis indicated that FOXO1 might be a target gene for miR-582-5p and its 3′UTR contains potential binding sites for miR-582-5p. To determine whether miR-582-5p could influence FOXO1 expression, miR-582-5p mimics or negative control of microRNA mimics were transfected into THP-1 cells. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the miR-582-5p could suppress both FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression. Co-transfection of miR-582-5p and FOXO1 3′UTR-luciferase reporter vector into cells demonstrated that significant decrease in luciferase activity was only found in reporter vector that contained a wild type sequence of FOXO1 3′UTR, suggesting that miR-582-5p could directly target FOXO1. In conclusion, miR-582-5p inhibited apoptosis of monocytes by down-regulating FOXO1 expression and might play an important role in regulating anti-M. tuberculosis directed immune responses. © 2013 Liu et al.

84889814405	Unraveling the characteristics of microRNA regulation in the developmental and aging process of the human brain	Background: Structure and function of the human brain are subjected to dramatic changes during its development and aging. Studies have demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of brain development and have a significant impact on brain aging and neurodegeneration. However, the underling molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In general, development and aging are conventionally studied separately, which may not completely address the physiological mechanism over the entire lifespan. Thus, we study the regulatory effect between miRNAs and mRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain by integrating miRNA and mRNA expression profiles throughout the lifetime. Methods. In this study, we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in the human brain across lifespan from the network perspective. First, we chose the age-related miRNAs by polynomial regression models. Second, we constructed the bipartite miRNA-mRNA regulatory network by pair-wise correlation coefficient analysis between miRNA and mRNA expression profiles. At last, we constructed the miRNA-miRNA synergistic network from the miRNA-mRNA network, considering not only the enrichment of target genes but also GO function enrichment of co-regulated target genes. Results: We found that the average degree of age-related miRNAs was significantly higher than that of non age-related miRNAs in the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network. The topological features between age-related and non age-related miRNAs were significantly different, and 34 reliable age-related miRNA synergistic modules were identified using Cfinder in the miRNA-miRNA synergistic network. The synergistic regulations of module genes were verified by reviewing miRNA target databases and previous studies. Conclusions: Age-related miRNAs play a more important role than non age-related mrRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain. The age-related miRNAs have synergism, which tend to work together as small modules. These results may provide a new insight into the regulation of miRNAs in the developmental and aging process of the human brain. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84890508675	DNMT3a rs1550117 polymorphism association with increased risk of Helicobacter pylori infection	Background: DNA methyltransferase-3a (DNMT3a) plays significant roles in embryogenesis and the generation of aberrant methylation in carcinogenesis. This study aimed to investigate associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3a gene and risk of Helicobacter pylori infection, gastric atrophy and gastric cancer. Methods: The subjects comprised 447 patients with gastric cancer; 111 individuals with gastric atrophy and 961 healthy controls. Two SNPs (rs1550117 and rs13420827) of the DNMT3a gene were genotyped by Taqman assay. DNMT3a expression was analyzed in cancer tissues from 89 patients by tissue microarray technique. Odds ratio (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among healthy controls, risk of H. pylori infection was significantly higher in subjects with the rs1550117 AA genotype, compared to those with GG/AG genotypes of DNMT3a [OR=2.08, (95%CI: 1.02-4.32)]. However, no significant correlation was found between the two SNPs and risk of developing gastric atrophy or gastric cancer. In addition, no increase in DNMT3a expression was observed in the gastric cancer with H.pylori infection. Conclusions: This study revealed that DNMT3a rs1550117 polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of H. pylori infection, but did not support any evidence for contributions of DNMT3a rs1550117 and rs13420827 to either gastric atrophy or gastric cancer. The biological roles of DNMT3a polymorphisms require further investigation.

84891897367	N-glycoproteome analysis of the secretome of human metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines combining hydrazide chemistry, HILIC enrichment and mass spectrometry	Cancer cell metastasis is a major cause of cancer death. Unfortunately, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown, which results in the lack of efficient diagnosis, therapy and prevention approaches. Nevertheless, the dysregulation of the cancer cell secretome is known to play key roles in tumor transformation and progression. The majority of proteins in the secretome are secretory proteins and membrane-released proteins, and, mostly, the glycosylated proteins. Until recently, few studies have explored protein N-glycosylation changes in the secretome, although protein glycosylation has received increasing attention in the study of tumor development processes. Here, the N-glycoproteins in the secretome of two human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines with low (MHCC97L) or high (HCCLM3) metastatic potential were investigated with a in-depth characterization of the N-glycosites by combining two general glycopeptide enrichment approaches, hydrazide chemistry and zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction chromatography (zic-HILIC), with mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 1,213 unique N-glycosites from 611 N-glycoproteins were confidently identified. These N-glycoproteins were primarily localized to the extracellular space and plasma membrane, supporting the important role of N-glycosylation in the secretory pathway. Coupling label-free quantification with a hierarchical clustering strategy, we determined the differential regulation of several N-glycoproteins that are related to metastasis, among which AFP, DKK1, FN1, CD151 and TGFβ2 were up-regulated in HCCLM3 cells. The inclusion of the well-known metastasis-related proteins AFP and DKK1 in this list provides solid supports for our study. Further western blotting experiments detecting FN1 and FAT1 confirmed our discovery. The glycoproteome strategy in this study provides an effective means to explore potential cancer biomarkers. © 2013 Li et al.

84892395519	Selection and validation of reference genes for real-time quantitative PCR in hyperaccumulating ecotype of Sedum alfredii under different heavy metals stresses	Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) has become an effective method for accurate analysis of gene expression in several biological systems as well as under different experimental conditions. Although with high sensitivity, specificity and broad dynamic range, this method requires suitable reference genes for transcript normalization in order to guarantee reproducible and meaningful results. In the present study, we evaluated five traditional housekeeping genes and five novel reference genes in Hyperaccumulating ecotype of Sedum alfredii, a well known hyperaccumulator for heavy metals phytoremediation, under Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu stresses of seven different durations. The expression stability of these ten candidates were determined with three programs - geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The results showed that all the selected reference genes except for SAND could be used for RT-qPCR normalization. Among them UBC9 and TUB were ranked as the most stable candidates across all samples by three programs together. For the least stable reference genes, however, BestKeeper produced different results compared with geNorm and NormFinder. Meanwhile, the expression profiles of PCS under Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu stresses were assessed using UBC9 and TUB respectively, and similar trends were obtained from the results of the two groups. The distinct expression patterns of PCS indicated that various strategies could be taken by plants in adaption to different heavy metals stresses. This study will provide appropriate reference genes for further gene expression quantification using RT-qPCR in Hyperaccumulator S. alfredii. © 2013 Sang et al.

84891765115	Systematic analysis of missing proteins provides clues to help define all of the protein-coding genes on human chromosome 1	Our first proteomic exploration of human chromosome 1 began in 2012 (CCPD 1.0), and the genome-wide characterization of the human proteome through public resources revealed that 32-39% of proteins on chromosome 1 remain unidentified. To characterize all of the missing proteins, we applied an OMICS-integrated analysis of three human liver cell lines (Hep3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3) using mRNA and ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNA deep sequencing and proteome profiling, contributing mass spectrometric evidence of 60 additional chromosome 1 gene products. Integration of the annotation information from public databases revealed that 84.6% of genes on chromosome 1 had high-confidence protein evidence. Hierarchical analysis demonstrated that the remaining 320 missing genes were either experimentally or biologically explainable; 128 genes were found to be tissue-specific or rarely expressed in some tissues, whereas 91 proteins were uncharacterized mainly due to database annotation diversity, 89 were genes with low mRNA abundance or unsuitable protein properties, and 12 genes were identifiable theoretically because of a high abundance of mRNAs/RNC-mRNAs and the existence of proteotypic peptides. The relatively large contribution made by the identification of enriched transcription factors suggested specific enrichment of low-abundance protein classes, and SRM/MRM could capture high-priority missing proteins. Detailed analyses of the differentially expressed genes indicated that several gene families located on chromosome 1 may play critical roles in mediating hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and metastasis. All mass spectrometry proteomics data corresponding to our study were deposited in the ProteomeXchange under the identifiers PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84892411125	Decreased Galectin-9 and increased Tim-3 expression are related to poor prognosis in gastric cancer	Introduction: Galectin-9 (Gal-9) induces adhesion and aggregation of certain cell types and inhibits the metastasis of tumor cells. T-cell immunoglobulin-and mucin domain-3-containing molecule 3 (TIM-3) plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. The aim of this study is to investigate Gal-9 and TIM-3 alterations in gastric cancer and their prognostic values. Methods: Gal-9 and Tim-3 expression was evaluated using a tissue microarray immunohistochemistry method in 305 gastric cancers, of which 84 had paired adjacent normal samples. Cell lines SGC-7901, BGC-823, MGC-803, MKN45 and GES-1 were also stained. Correlations were analyzed between expression levels of Gal-9 and Tim-3 protein and tumor parameters or clinical outcomes. Results: Gal-9 and Tim-3 stained positive on tumor cells in 86.2% (263/305), and 60.0% (183/305) patients with gastric cancer, respectively. Gal-9 expression was significantly higher in cancer than in normal mucosa (P<0.001). Reduced Gal-9 expression was associated with lymph-vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and worse TNM staging (P = 0.034, P = 0.009, P = 0.002 and P = 0.043, respectively). In contrast, Tim-3 expression was significantly lower in cancer than in control mucosa (P,0.001). Patients with lymph-vascular invasion had higher expression levels of Tim-3 (P<0.001). Moreover, multivariate analysis shows that both high Gal-9 expression and low Tim-3 expression were significantly associated with long overall survival (P = 0.002, P = 0.010, respectively); the combination of Gal-9 and Tim-3 expression was an independent prognostic predictor for patients with gastric cancer (RR: 0.43; 95%CI: 0.20-0.93). H.pylori infection status was not associated with Gal-9 and Tim-3 expression (P = 0.102, P = 0.565). Conclusion: The results suggest that expression of Gal-9 and Tim-3 in tumor cells may be a potential, independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. Gal-9 and TIM-3 may play an important part in the gastric carcinogenesis. © 2013 Jiang et al.

84891801560	Chromosome-8-coded proteome of Chinese Chromosome Proteome Data Set (CCPD) 2.0 with partial immunohistochemical verifications	We upgraded the preliminary CCPD 1.0 to CCPD 2.0 using the latest deep-profiling proteome (CCPD 2013) of three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, namely, Hep3B, MHCC97H, and HCCLM3 (ProteomeXchange identifiers: PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535). CCPD 2.0 totally covered 63.6% (438/689) of Chr. 8-coded proteins and 62.6% (439/701) of Chr. 8-coded protein-coding genes. Interestingly, we found that the missing proteins exhibited a tendency to form a cluster region in chromosomes, such as two β-defensins clusters in Chr. 8, caused perhaps by their inflammation-related features. For the 41 Chr. 8-coded proteins being weakly or barely identified previously, we have performed an immunohistochemical (IHC) verification in 30 pairs of carcinoma/para- carcinoma HCC and 20 noncancerous liver tissues and confirmed their expressional evidence and occurrence proportions in tissue samples. We also verified 13 Chr. 8-coded HCC tumorigenesis-associated depleting or deficient proteins reported in CCPD 1.0 using IHC and screened 16 positive and 24 negative HCC metastatic potential-correlated proteins from large-scale label-free proteome quantitation data of CCPD 2013. Our results suggest that the selection of proper samples and the methodology to look for targeted missing proteins should be carefully considered in further verifications for the remaining Chr. 8-coded proteins. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84892450005	The rooting of poplar cuttings: A review	Poplar (Populus spp.) is one of the most important economical tree species in temperate regions of the world. Easy propagation by cutting has made most of the selected genotypes of poplar available for intensive plantation with large genetic gains. Critical point for successful propagation of cutting is the development of roots. Thus, rooting context of the cutting appeared to be a pivotal scenario in poplar vegetative propagations. In this overview, we focus on the progress in defining the genetic, physical, chemical and environmental factors that influences the poplar cuttings to develop adventitious roots. These factors include genotype effect, physiological conditions of the stock plants, plant growth regulators, temperature, rooting substrates/media as major variables for the development of rooting events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84891816492	Systematic analyses of the transcriptome, translatome, and proteome provide a global view and potential strategy for the C-HPP	To estimate the potential of the state-of-the-art proteomics technologies on full coverage of the encoding gene products, the Chinese Human Chromosome Proteome Consortium (CCPC) applied a multiomics strategy to systematically analyze the transciptome, translatome, and proteome of the same cultured hepatoma cells with varied metastatic potential qualitatively and quantitatively. The results provide a global view of gene expression profiles. The 9064 identified high confident proteins covered 50.2% of all gene products in the translatome. Those proteins with function of adhesion, development, reproduction, and so on are low abundant in transcriptome and translatome but absent in proteome. Taking the translatome as the background of protein expression, we found that the protein abundance plays a decisive role and hydrophobicity has a greater influence than molecular weight and isoelectric point on protein detectability. Thus, the enrichment strategy used for low-abundant transcription factors helped to identify missing proteins. In addition, those peptides with single amino acid polymorphisms played a significant role for the disease research, although they might negligibly contribute to new protein identification. The proteome raw and metadata of proteome were collected using the iProX submission system and submitted to ProteomeXchange (PXD000529, PXD000533, and PXD000535).

84895161991	Enhanced cold stress tolerance of transgenic Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro (Ma bamboo) plants expressing a bacterial CodA gene	Ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro) is a widespread culm and shoot-producing species in southern China. However, low temperatures reduce Ma bamboo shoot production and delay its development. In an attempt to enhance its cold-tolerance, a bacterial CodA gene encoding choline oxidase was introduced into Ma bamboo by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, an approach that had not been previously utilized in bamboo. PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed that CodA had integrated into the Ma bamboo genome. RT-PCR results showed that expression of CodA driven by the Arabidopsis Rd29A promoter was induced by cold stress in the transgenic bamboo lines. Following treatment at 4°C for 24 h, the content of glycine betaine (GB) increased to 83% and 140% in control plants (wild type (WT)) and CodA transgenic Ma bamboo plants, respectively. Superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase activities increased in both transgenic and WT plants. However, increases in these enzymes activities were much greater in the transgenic lines than in the WT plants under cold stress. The accumulation of malondialdehyde and electrolyte leakage (REL) in CodA transgenic Ma bamboo plants was less than that in control plants. Collectively, these results suggest that increased cold-tolerance induced by accumulation of GB in vivo was associated with the enhancement of antioxidant enzyme activities, which led to reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and stabilization of membrane integrity against extreme temperatures in transgenic plants. © 2014 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

84896859436	Validation of reference genes aiming accurate normalization of qRT-PCR data in Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro	Background: Dendrocalamus latiflorus Munro distributes widely in subtropical areas and plays vital roles as valuable natural resources. The transcriptome sequencing for D. latiflorus Munro has been performed and numerous genes especially those predicted to be unique to D. latiflorus Munro were revealed. qRT-PCR has become a feasible approach to uncover gene expression profiling, and the accuracy and reliability of the results obtained depends upon the proper selection of stable reference genes for accurate normalization. Therefore, a set of suitable internal controls should be validated for D. latiflorus Munro. Results: In this report, twelve candidate reference genes were selected and the assessment of gene expression stability was performed in ten tissue samples and four leaf samples from seedlings and anther-regenerated plants of different ploidy. The PCR amplification efficiency was estimated, and the candidate genes were ranked according to their expression stability using three software packages: geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper. GAPDH and EF1α were characterized to be the most stable genes among different tissues or in all the sample pools, while CYP showed low expression stability. RPL3 had the optimal performance among four leaf samples. The application of verified reference genes was illustrated by analyzing ferritin and laccase expression profiles among different experimental sets. The analysis revealed the biological variation in ferritin and laccase transcript expression among the tissues studied and the individual plants. Conclusions: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper analyses recommended different suitable reference gene(s) for normalization according to the experimental sets. GAPDH and EF1α had the highest expression stability across different tissues and RPL3 for the other sample set. This study emphasizes the importance of validating superior reference genes for qRT-PCR analysis to accurately normalize gene expression of D. latiflorus Munro. © 2014 Liu et al.

84904209403	Comparative Proteomic Analysis of Responses to Salt Stress in Chinese Willow (Salix matsudana Koidz)	Salinity in soils is among the major constraints of agricultural and forestry productivity worldwide. To investigate the basis of salt tolerance in Salix matsudana Koidz (Chinese willow), comparative proteomes of 1.5-month-old cuttings were analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). Proteins were extracted from roots of plants grown under 100 mM NaCl stress for 6, 24, or 48 h; whereas proteins from stems and leaves were extracted from plants grown under 100 mM NaCl stress for a period of 48 h. In total, 42, 17 and 19 differential protein spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF in roots, stems and leaves, respectively. The majority of these salt stress-responsive proteins were organ specific. The identified proteins were involved in 12 metabolic pathways and processes, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that some of the proteins, such as USP-like, PR-10 and quinone reductase, were regulated by salt stress at the level of transcription. Pathogenesis-related proteins, in particular, were found to be abundant and up-regulated by salt stress. This suggests that PRs may be closely related to S. matsudana defense against salt stress, possibly by enhancing the resistance to opportunistic fungal attack. Based on the predicted functions of the identified proteins, we propose a salt stress response model describing a possible management strategy for cellular activities in S. matsudana under short-term salinity stress. Furthermore, some of the identified proteins might be potential candidates to improve salt tolerance in woody plants. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84905028276	Overexpression of BpAP1 induces early flowering and produces dwarfism in Betula platyphylla × Betula pendula	The involvement of APETALA1 (AP1) in the flowering transition has been the focus of much research. Here, we produced Betula platyphylla × Betula pendula (birch) lines that overexpressed BpAP1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation; we obtained five independent 35S::BpAP1 transgenic lines. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern, northern and western analyses were used to identify the transformants. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), BpAP1 expression in roots, shoots, leaves and terminal buds of 35S::BpAP1 transgenic lines was significantly higher than that in the wild type (WT, P < 0.01). The average height of 2-year-old 35S::BpAP1 plants was significantly lower (41.17%) than that of non-transgenic plants. In the 35S::BpAP1 lines, inflorescences emerged successively beginning 2 months after transplanting. In addition, the length-diameter ratio of fully developed male and female inflorescences were both significantly less than those of the WT (P < 0.05), i.e. the morphological characteristic was stubby. The male inflorescences emerged early, with empty, draped anthers, and pollen was rarely produced, whereas the female floret structure was not different from WT. The pistils developed normally and could accept pollen, leading to the production of hybrid progeny (F

84907287298	Mucosal-associated invariant T-cell function is modulated by programmed death-1 signaling in patients with active tuberculosis	Rationale: Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells have been proven to play an important role in host defense against mycobacterial infection in animal infection models; however, the functional role ofMAIT cells in patients with active tuberculosis (TB) is still largely unknown. Objectives: To understand the clinical features and functions of MAIT cells in patients with active TB. Methods: MAIT cells were analyzed in patients with pulmonary TB, tuberculous pleurisy, and tuberculous peritonitis by flow cytometry. The functions of MAIT cells were compared between patients with active TB and healthy control subjects. Measurements and Main Results: The frequency of MAIT cells was significantly reduced both in peripheral blood from patients with active pulmonary TB (P , 0.0001) and in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with healthy control subjects but not in ascitic fluids from patients with tuberculous peritonitis. A comparison of bacillus Calmette-Gu'erin (BCG)-stimulated cytokine production showed that patients with active TB had significantly higher production of IFN-g (P = 0.0034) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a (P = 0.0399) compared with healthy control subjects. In contrast, when MAIT cells were stimulated with Escherichia coli, patients with active TB had significantly lower production of IFN-g (P = 0.0007) and TNF-a (P = 0.0032). MAIT cells in patients with active TB exhibited elevated expression of programmed death-1 (PD-1) (P = 0.0015), and blockade of PD-1 signaling resulted in a significantly higher frequency of BCG-stimulated IFN-g production in MAIT cells (P = 0.0178). Conclusions: MAIT-cell immune response to antigen stimulation in patients with active TB is regulated by PD-1, which could be a potential target for TB immunotherapy.

84908325481	Comparative genomic analysis of transgenic poplar dwarf mutant reveals numerous differentially expressed genes involved in energy flow	In our previous research, the Tamarix androssowii LEA gene (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant protein Mrna, GenBank ID: DQ663481) was transferred into Populus simonii × Populus nigra. Among the eleven transgenic lines, one exhibited a dwarf phenotype compared to the wild type and other transgenic lines, named dwf1. To uncover the mechanisms underlying this phenotype, digital gene expression libraries were produced from dwf1, wild-type, and other normal transgenic lines, XL-5 and XL-6. Gene expression profile analysis indicated that dwf1 had a unique gene expression pattern in comparison to the other two transgenic lines. Finally, a total of 1246 dwf1-unique differentially expressed genes were identified. These genes were further subjected to gene ontology and pathway analysis. Results indicated that photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism related genes were significantly affected. In addition, many transcription factors genes were also differentially expressed in dwf1. These various differentially expressed genes may be critical for dwarf mutant formation; thus, the findings presented here might provide insight for our understanding of the mechanisms of tree growth and development.

84908350507	Isolation of salt stress-related genes from aspergillus glaucus CCHA by random overexpression in escherichia coli	The halotolerant fungus Aspergillus glaucus CCHA was isolated from the surface of wild vegetation around a saltern with the salinity range being 0-31%. Here, a full-length cDNA library of A. glaucus under salt stress was constructed to identify genes related to salt tolerance, and one hundred clones were randomly selected for sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Among these, 82 putative sequences were functionally annotated as being involved in signal transduction, osmolyte synthesis and transport, or regulation of transcription. Subsequently, the cDNA library was transformed into E. coli cells to screen for putative salt stress-related clones. Five putative positive clones were obtained from E. coli cells grown on LB agar containing 1 M NaCl, on which they showed rapid growth compared to the empty vector control line. Analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines overexpressing CCHA-2142 demonstrated that the gene conferred increased salt tolerance to plants as well by protecting the cellular membranes, suppressing the inhibition of chlorophyll biosynthesis. These results highlight the utility of this A. glaucus cDNA library as a tool for isolating and characterizing genes related to salt tolerance. Furthermore, the identified genes can be used for the study of the underlying biology of halotolerance.

84911164428	Expression of Ang-2/Tie-2 and PI3K/AKT in colorectal cancer	Purpose: To study the expression of angiogenin-2 (Ang-2) and its receptor Tie-2 in colorectal cancer and discuss the possible mechanisms behind this process. Materials and Methods: Using the streptavidin-peroxidase (SP) immunohistochemical method, paraffin sections from 100 colorectal cancer samples and 10 samples from tumor-adjacent normal tissue (> 2cm from the edge of the gross tumor) were tested for protein expression of Ang-2, Tie-2, PI3K, and AKT. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blots were further used to measure expression of the 4 genes and proteins in 20 freshly-resected colorectal cancer samples and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Results: In colorectal cancer tissues, the expression of the Ang-2, Tie-2, PI3K, and AKT genes and their proteins was significantly higher than in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. Protein expression in poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma was higher than that in well and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. According to Duke's classification, the protein expression in Stages C and D was significantly higher than that in Stages A and B. In the group with lymphatic metastasis, the protein expression was higher than that without lymphatic metastasis. Conclusions: In colorectal cancer, the expression of the Ang-2, Tie-2, PI3K, and AKT genes and their proteins is markedly higher than those in tumor-adjacent normal tissues. No correlation was observed between protein expression and gender, location, or histologic type. Correlations did exist between protein expression and differentiation level, stage of Duke's classification, and lymphatic metastasis; in colorectal cancer tissues with lower differentiation levels, higher stages of Duke's classification, and lymphatic metastasis, the expression of all 4 proteins was higher. The study of their expression patterns and relationships with aggression and metastasis will provide a valuable experimental foundation for assessing prognosis and targeted therapy of colorectal cancer.
