84940311346	Paeoniflorin accelerates annulus fibrosus cells proliferation	BACKGROUND: Chinese herbaceous peony has been usually used in the treatment of cervical spondylosis in a frequency of over 30%. Paeoniflorin, known as one of the main monomers, has cell-protective abilities against inflammation and apoptosis. Despite these compelling observations, whether paeoniflorin protects annulus fibrosus cells is not reported. OBJECTIVE: To explore the proliferative and protective effects of paeoniflorin on intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus cells. METHODS: Annulus fibrosus cells derived from the intervertebral disc were digested with trypsin and collagenase type for the further culture in vitro. The third-passage annulus fibrosus cells were selected to establish an apoptosis model in response to Fas ligand (20 μg/L) and were interfered with paeoniflorin. The appropriate concentration of paeoniflorin was detected by the method of MTT. Apoptotic rate was evaluated with Annexin V/FITC double staining. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 20. 8 and 2. 08 μmol/L paeoniflorin significantly promoted the proliferation of annulus fibrosus cells. The apoptotic rate of annulus fibrosus cells in vitro was significantly increased after induction with the 20 μg/L Fas ligand. 20. 8 μmol/L paeoniflorin could protect annulus fibrosus cells against Fas ligand-induced apoptosis.

On this basis, the temperature field tests of tread braking were fulfilled with the domestic wheels of rolled steel material, which focused on the heat transferring relations from the friction pair to the rotation wheel tread surface in the braking process. Through simulating the law of alternating variation about the friction heat convection and the heat transmission in one wheel rotating cycle, a three-dimensional finite element model of the transient temperature field in the tread braking process was developed to revise the calculation defects of the thermal stress based on the traditional theory which simplified the heat-flow presumption from overall input to heat convection and transfer, and was confirmed through the tread braking temperature verification tests in the friction brake power-test-bed. The temperature field simulation can fully reflect the actual status from the whole to details and can be further used to determine the limit of the wheel tread braking mode, provide more reliable parameters and theoretical analysis for the development of braking mode and braking specification.

84877225849	Whole field bonded steel tensile test using digital image correlation system	Adhesive bonding has many applications in the automotive industry. The single-lapped bonded joint is the most typically used among various bonding types. This paper presents experimental research for determining the strain field of the single-lapped joint under tensile loading. The materials for the joint are epoxy-based structural adhesive and low-carbon electrolytic zinc steel plate. In the study, a DIC (digital image correlation) system was adopted to measure the strain distribution of the bonded joint during a tensile test. The bonded steel coupons in the tensile test were prepared according to the ASTM standard. During the measurement, images of the coupon joint were taken before and after the deformation process. Then the DIC system measured the strain of bonded joint by comparing two consecutive images. The measured data from the DIC was compared to data taken simultaneously from a traditional extensometer. The comparison showed that the DIC data is accurate and DIC measurement is reliable for obtaining full-range strain of bonded steels. It gives the true strain at each point while the traditional method can only give average strain. The strain measurement results showed the non-uniform deformation of the joint in the tensile test. Coupon strain concentrates near the upper and lower lap area extremities while lower strain is observed in the lap area. The adhesive corner points possess the highest strain among the whole adhesive layer. Copyright © 2010 SAE International.

84877896721	Necking of Q&P steel during uniaxial tensile test with the aid of DIC technique	A lot of research has been focused on the necking process during the plastic deformation of sheet metals, but the localized necking is rarely distinguished form diffused necking by experiments, due to the limit of measurement equipment and method. Quenching and Partitioning (Q&P) steel is a 3rd generation advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Its good combination of high strength and ductility ensures potential application in automobile industry. Uniaxial tensile tests of QP980 steel sheet at five strain rates are performed to investigate the necking process and the effect of strain rate on necking behavior of Q&P steel. Digital image correlation (DIC) method is applied during tensile tests, and evolutions of major strain, minor strain and normal strain distributions along gauge section of the tensile specimens are obtained. The diffused and localized necking strains are determined according to SWIFT necking theory and HILL necking theory respectively. The test results indicate that with the increasing of strain rate in the investigated range, the diffused necking strain decreases from 0.152 to 0.120 and localized necking strain decreases from 0.245 to 0.137. Meanwhile, the difference of the two strains decreases form 0.096 to 0.017. Thus it can be concluded that strain rate has an influence on both necking strains during the deformation of QP980 steel sheet. Diffused and localized necking strains are determined by uniaxial tensile tests with the aid of DIC technique and the effect of strain rate on necking strains is evaluated. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

Mechanical properties of these joint are the key parameters to evaluate the formability of similar tailor welded blanks and establish the finite element models. To determine the mechanical properties of laser welds, true stress-strain curve of laser weld was analyzed base on rule of mixture in addition to the utilization of microstructure approach and Digital Image Correlation (DIC). DIC was utilized to determine full-field strain during uniaxial tensile tests and local strains were derived from the strain field and were used to calculate the stress-strain curve. It is shown that the analysis curve is agreed well with the experimental curve of small specimen within the stable deformation stage. However, there are very great differences in the necking behavior, which is probably due to the constraint effect of base material adjacent to the joint. As a result, necking behavior of laser weld is hindered. The strain ratio of laser weld was approximately -0.63, which was deviate from the status of uniaxial tension in which the strain ratio is -0.5. Analytic curve is the true stress-strain curve of laser welds.

The temperature of inner wall and outer wall of the hollow sucker rod was simulated, and the factors affecting the temperature distribution were analyzed. There exits a functional relationship among the temperature distribution, the current frequency, and the heating time. The higher the frequency, the higher the temperature. The longer the heating time, the higher the temperature. By changing the alternating current frequency and the heating time, the temperature of hollow sucker rod could be controlled to suit the exploitation of different kinds of heavy oil. An example was given to show that the application of the hollow sucker rod's temperature analysis could estimate the preheating time during heavy oil recovery, which provides a reasonable reference for selecting the current frequency and the heating time. © 2008 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration & Development, PetroChina.

To improve the cosmetic surface qualities, it is important to optimize the process parameters to avoid dent defects in forming parts and to minimize production cost. The relationships between defects magnitude and forming parameters like die radius, punch radius, fuel filler radius, blank holder force (BHF) and friction coefficient can be established through finite element analysis (FEA). A reduced set of finite element simulations are carried out as per the orthogonal design array. Take the depth Δz and the width L of the surface dent as optimization objectives, an optimization methodology based on the use of orthogonal design method and the response surface technique based on Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) is proposed to obtain the optimum values of above forming parameters, which can reduce the dent without cracking and damage of product, and Δz and L is gained depending on the optimized parameters by FEA. The optimization results of parameters are compared with the ones achieved by Trial and Error approach in industry.

The available reports about this steel mainly focus on hot uniaxial tensile, martensitic transformation and forming process, but there are few investigations on instability behavior and forming limits. Based on Inoue Kachiro's flow stress constitutive model at elevated temperature, combined with Swift's diffuse instability rule and Hill's localized instability rule, the relation is theoretically deduced between the diffuse necking rate along with the localized necking rate and the exponent of strain rate sensitivity together with the strain rate in the case of the USIBOR1500 steel sheets at elevated temperature. According to the time-temperature characteristics of the hot stamping process, tensile tests of the steel sheets were carried out on Gleeble3800, and the stress-strain curves were obtained at different temperatures and different strain rates. Then the values of the exponent of strain rate sensitivity and the hardening exponent were obtained through fitting the curves by least squares.

In this paper, the influences of integrated strength on cracking trend and cracking type are investigated through bulging simulation and experiments. It is proposed that the integrated strength should be considered as a crucial factor during the TWB designing. Reasonable integrated strengths matching of base metals can improve the formability of the tailor welded blanks and reduce the trend of cracking. In the case that the integrated strengths of base metals are significantly different, the cracking occurs in the weaker side and is parallel to the welded seam; while the cracking appears in the welded seam and is vertical to it under the condition that the integrated strengths match well. The corresponding technological measures can be adopted as the guidance for materials selection and reasonable matching in the designing. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

According to the FEM results, the prediction based on Chaboche nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening rule is consistent with the experimental data, while isotropic hardening rule makes imprecise prediction. This is because internal stress and moment of the part after forming are over-estimated when neglecting the Bauschinger effect. ©2010 IEEE.

77958085617	Effect of welding orientation on tensile properties of tailor welded blanks	To improve the formability of tailor welded blanks (TWBs), the effect of welding orientation on a TWB was studied in uniaxial tensile tests. Analytical, experimental and simulating methods were employed to study the effect of welding orientation on entire elongations and failure patterns of TWBs. The results show that failure occurs across the weld line when the angle is small. As the angle increases, the entire elongation decreases nonlinearly and the rate also decreases. When the angle is over a certain degree, failure occurs in the thinner sheet and the entire elongation increases with the increasing angle, but the rate decreases gradually. In failure patterns transforming, there exists a critical value of welding orientation which determines the failure pattern, and it depends on the properties of weld line and thinner sheet of TWBs. Proper welding orientation contributes to the formability improvement of a TWB and the failure pattern control.

77958097700	Experimental and finite element analysis on the curing process of single-lapped adhesive joint in a closed condition	The enclosure conditions have great influence on the curing of adhesive-bonded joints. Experiments were conducted to learn the curing of adhesive joint in a closed condition, the influence of curing time on the temperature of joint and curing degree of adhesive layer was obtained. In order to predict the curing degree of joint in a closed condition, 3-D finite element model based on heat transferring model and cure kinetics were developed to model the curing of joint, simulation was validated by experiment results. The results indicate that the temperature distributions of the joints are not even at the beginning of the curing, temperature on the single-lap area is lower than the left and right side. With the curing time increase, temperature distribution becomes more uniform in the joint. With the increase of curing time, the degree of curing of joints increases slowly at first then increases greatly.

The finite element method was employed to analyze the influence laws of the weld properties and initial width ratio on the tensile strength and mean elongation with constant base material properties. The results demonstrate that the strength coefficient K of the weld has more influence on the tensile strength and less effect on the mean elongation; the hardening coefficient n is just contrary; initial width ratio has significant effect on them in its sensitive area (0~20) and when initial width ratio exceeds 20, the effect becomes subtle.

In this paper, the TWB with same thicknesses base metals is taken as research object. Finite Element (FE) simulation and analytical calculation are applied to analyze the strain relationship between welded seam and neighboring base metal under specific strain state and the corresponding strain state of the neighboring base metal under different forming limit states. The strain relationship between them is projective corresponding to each other, and is affected by the material properties. The formability decrease of TWB when cracking occurs in welded seam can be explained in terms of the variation laws of strain state and strain values of welded seam and neighboring base metal. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Experiments and FE simulations were performed to study the effect of material parameters of TWB's parent sheets such as t (thickness ratio), k (strength factor of materials), n (strain hardening index), r (anisotropy index) on LDH and weld-line movement of TWB. Orthogonal experiments and range analysis were used to analyze the sensitivity on effect of different parameter on LDH and weld-line movement. The results show that LDH of TWB decreases with increasing ration of stronger sheets parameters to weaker ones, and the rate decreases gradually; in contrary, weld-line movement increases and the increasing rate decreases gradually. Furthermore, different parameters make various contributions to LDH and weld-line movement of TWBs and the effect degree of each parameter changes with different thickness ratios. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

The dynamic FEM model of uniaxial tensile adhesive joint was established, in which strain fracture criteria is adopted. It can be observed from the FEM results that: lapped area of the joint bears shear stress primarily, the adherend areas located away from the lapped area bear steady tensile stress mainly and the adherend areas adjacent to lapped area endure tensile and shear stress simultaneously. Based on stress distribution characters, the joint was divided into three areas (lapped area, stress transfer area and uniform stress area) and an analytical model predicting the length of stress transfer areas was developed. DIC technology was applied to measure the whole field strain of the joint. It can be seen from the DIC results that the joints area division and the model of predicting the length of stress transfer length are feasible. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications.

79952491823	Effect of the thickness ratio on the failure modes of tailor welded blanks	Tailor welded blanks (TWBs) offer several notable benefits including decreased part weight, reduced manufacturing costs, increased environmental friendliness, and improved dimensional consistency. To take full advantage of these benefits, however, one needs to overcome the reduced formability of TWBs and be able to accurately predict the failure modes depending on the thickness ratio between the thicker and thinner sheets of a tailor welded blank with similar base materials early in the design process. In this paper, we studied the effect of the thickness ratio on the limit dome height of TWBs by using finite element method and experiments, analyzed the effect of TR on the failure mode of TWBs. A concept of the critical thickness ratio was presented to predict the failure modes of TWBs. The results show that the rapture originates on the weld of TWBs when the thickness ratio is less than the critical thickness ratio and on the thinner side when the thickness ratio exceeds the critical thickness ratio. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Prior to adhesive curing, the adhesive and galvanized steel coupons were pre-exposed to 96% relative humidity at 40 °C (i.e., open-faced exposure). It was found that the exposure of adhesive and steel sheets in hot humid environment decreases the quasi-static strength of adhesive-bonded galvanized DP600 steel joints by as much as 96% after 1008 h of exposure. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy of quasi-static tensile tested specimens and moisture absorption testing of bulk adhesive revealed that static strength degradation is mainly due to the plasticization and micro-cracking of adhesive and zinc oxidation by the water vapor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization of the modes for body-in-white has significant meanings for improving the reliability and NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) performance of the whole vehicle.

The heat transferring process of the adhesive joint in an exposed environment has also been executed for comparison purpose. The FE temperature results of both joints are validated by experiments. It has been found that the joint temperature in a closed enclosure rises much more slowly compared with the joint in an exposed environment within the curing process. Due to the thickness variation along the adhesive joint, it can be observed on both joints the lap area always obtains the lowest temperature while the joint ends obtain the highest ones. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

It is one of the most effective approaches for vehicle light weighting. Dynamic recovery is the major softening mechanism of the boron steel under austenite state at elevated temperatures. Deformation mechanism of the boron steel can be revealed by investigation on the behavior of dynamic recovery, which could also improve the accuracy of forming simulations for hot stamping. Uniaxial tensile experiments of the boron steel are carried out on the thermo-mechanical simulator Gleeble3800 at elevated temperatures. The true stress-strain curves and the relations between the work hardening rate and flow stress are obtained in different deformation conditions. The work hardening rate decreases linearly with increasing the flow stress. A flow stress model is derived based on Kocks model, and the derivative of the dislocation density with respect to the true strain, which is expressed by the peak stress and initial yield stress, is also deduced considering the dynamic recovery effect. A dynamic recovery efficiency factor h is defined as the ratio of the dynamic recovery effect and the dislocation accumulation effect. The effects of the deformation conditions on the h are analyzed. © 2011 SAE International.

79959961073	A design of experiments assessment of moisture content in uncured adhesive on static strength of adhesive-bonded galvanized SAE1006 steel	As part of a cooperative research program to develop and implement crash-resistant toughened adhesives targeted for future vehicles, this paper summarizes a study of the influence of pre-exposure of uncured adhesive and steel sheets in a humid and elevated temperature environment on quasi-static strength of bonded hot dipped galvanized SAE1006 steel joints. In this study, we use a DOE (design-of-experiment) program called DEXPERT to design the experiment and to analyze the effects of exposure temperature, exposure time, curing temperature and curing time on joint strength of adhesive-bonded galvanized SAE1006 steel. Prior to adhesive curing, the adhesive and galvanized steel coupons were pre-exposed to various relative humidity levels and temperatures. The experimental results were then analyzed by DEXPERT and the relative contributions of each factor on variance in joint strength were calculated. It was found that curing temperature is the most influential factor affecting the strength of adhesive-bonded galvanized SAE1006 steel joints. The curing of a joint at 180 °C can increase the robustness of the process and provides the greatest strength regardless of the variation of other factors. The joint strength curing at 150 °C shows a strong sensitivity to the curing time, while the adhesive cannot cure at 130 °C at all under all conditions. It has also been found that the pre-exposure of adhesive and steel for an hour can slightly decrease the joint strength at high temperature and humidity. Therefore, the effect of long time exposure of the uncured adhesive and steel still needs to be further investigated. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79959667145	Effect of deformation temperature on the microstructure of boron steel 22MnB5	In order to investigate the effect of deformation temperature on the microstructure of boron steel 22MnB5, uniaxial tensile tests and quenching tests of the steel were performed on the thermo-mechanical simulator Gleeble3800. The deformation temperatures range from 500 °C to 900 °C. The deformation rate of all the specimens with a deformation amount of 4 mm is 5 mm/s, while the cooling rates before and after deformation are 30 °C/s. Samples taken from the middle of the specimens, where the deformation was relatively homogenous, were grinded, polished, corroded. Then the Vickers hardness of the samples was measured and the metallographic observations were also conducted. The test results show that the deformation temperature has a significant influence on the microstructure and the Vickers hardness of the steel. When the deformation temperature is higher than 700 °C, the volume fraction of martensite and the Vickers hardness decrease as the deformation temperature decreases, but the amount of ferrite increases due to that the specimens deformed in the ferrite zone on the CCT diagram and the deformation induced and accelerated the transformation from austenite to ferrite. The martensite dominates the microstructure again and a small amount of retained austenite also appears when the specimen deformed at the temperature of 600 °C which is lower than the finishing temperature of the ferrite transformation. It results in a higher Vickers hardness. While the deformation took place at a lower temperature (500 °C), the volume fraction of martensite decreases again and the Vickers hardness of the specimen decreases. Since a decrease of deformation temperature results an increasing of yield strength of the specimen which inhibits the martensitic nucleation, the specimen deformed at 500 °C shows less martensite. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.

The simulation work was conducted with the aim to study the change law of the bugle forming limit of TWB with the matching relation between the material properties and its thickness of base metals with the verified numerical model, and the non-uniform deformation was analyzed under different matching conditions. The results indicate that rational matching of initial blank thickness and material properties can reduce the integrated strength ratio of TWB, decrease the deformation non-uniformity during the forming process, and thus improve its stamping formability. This could provide certain theoretical basis for the part design and also provide advantage for the quality improvement of TWB parts.

According to the joint energy balance, the temperature variation of the joint has been studied, following which the analytic curing degree prediction model of joint is established, and then verified through experiments. Finally, the effects of curing parameters and substrate thickness on the curing degree were discussed. It has been found that increasing cuing temperature can significantly improve the curing rate of the joint while increasing the preheat temperature or decreasing the adherend thickness can not improve the curing rate of the joint, but make the curing of adhesive start earlier. It has also been found that the effect of preheat temperature can be more pronounced at a great adherend thickness.

The effects of pre-deformation and cooling rate on the phase transformation should be understood before conducting indirect hot stamping experiments of vehicle components. Uniaxial tensile tests of boron steel at RT were carried out to obtain specimens with different pre-strain levels. Then they were heated to 900°C according to the indirect hot stamping process and quenching tests were performed on them at different cooling rates. Metallographic observations were performed on the quenched specimens and their hardness was measured. The results show that the pre-strain at RT has little influence on the phase transformation of boron steel. This is due to the dislocation structure introduced by deformation at RT recovered during the heating process and it is good for the indirect hot stamping. Upper B-pillar parts were first cold pre-formed, and then were heated and hot stamped. The microstructure and hardness results at different locations on the indirect hot stamped components are demonstrated qualified. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

Based on the proposed analytical model, the major influencing factors of the entire elongation and the weld line movement as well as their effects on tensile properties of TWBs can be revealed.

According to the whole field strain distribution of the specimen, the normal anisotropy coefficient r is calculated, which increases with increasing strain level. The material locating at the centre of the necking band was not in uniaxial tensile state any more during localized instability period, and its strain state leaned to plane strain state. According to forming limit theory, it reached the forming limits first. Therefore, the centre of the localized necking band is perpendicular to the major strain direction, and there is an angle 32° between the normal direction of two sides of the necking band and the major strain direction. This is almost according to Hill's zero-extension hypothesis. © 2011 IBF (RWTH Aachen) & IUL (TU Dortmund).

84864512923	Mold-flow equilibrium coefficient correction of polymer extrusion	The reasonable design of the extrusion die is essential for the required shape and precise dimensioning of extrusion products. Uneven geometrical deformation as occurring in extrusion swelling, which is caused by the unbalance of mold flow, is one of the difficult points in the design of extrusion die. The traditional mold-flow equilibrium coefficient needs to sub-divide the cross section of flow, which have high uncertainty for complex plastic profiles. Mold-flow equilibrium coefficient for traditional polymer extrusion is modified, and a modified mold-flow equilibrium coefficient which is efficient for numerical calculation and theoretical investigation is proposed, which is validated by numerical simulation. The modified mold-flow equilibrium coefficient has eliminated the influence of the extrusion speed and outlet cross-sectional area in the numerical analysis process. It is only correlated to material constitutive if the shape of the product is certain, therefore can more accurately reflect mold flow balance out of the outlet. The modified mold-flow equilibrium coefficient is mainly used in the reverse extrusion and design optimization for solving the shape of the die. © 2012 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

In this paper, we contrasted energy absorption, section force, and maximum displacement of the two different front bumper systems in low-speed collision. The analysis shows the front bumper inner plate using hot forming AHSS can improve the crashworthiness of automobiles and make it more balanced and reasonable to transfer collision energy and force. As a result, the maximum displacement of the front bumper system decreases and other parts such as front side rails can be safer.

84869888262	Anelastic behavior and phenomenological modeling of Mg ZEK100-O alloy sheet under cyclic tensile loading-unloading	Cyclic tensile loading-unloading tests were carried out with a cyclically incremental strain of 0.03% in a strain range of 0-2% and with cyclically incremental strain of 1% till fracture to investigate the anelastic behavior of annealed Mg ZEK100 alloy sheet. Large hysteresis stress-strain loops were observed in all cyclic loading-unloading tests, which indicate that the annealed Mg ZEK100 alloy sheet exhibits obvious anelastic effect. Due to the fact that twins are easier to produce in transverse direction (TD) than in rolling direction (RD), the alloy shows larger hysteresis loops in TD when applying cyclic loading-unloading. Both true stress and true plastic strain have an effect on the anelastic effect. At a stress, ~15. MPa higher than the yield strength, the anelastic effect reaches the maximum and the hysteresis loops add an anelastic strain of 0.0018 in RD and 0.003 in TD to the total elastic strain, and consequently lead to a decrease of 30% and 54% in the apparent elastic modulus in RD and TD, respectively. This phenomenon is discussed in terms of the roles of partially reversible twinning and dislocation slip upon unloading and reloading. A novel phenomenological model is developed to describe the anelastic behavior in the Mg alloy, and the calculated hysteresis loops agree well with the experimental ones. Cyclic hardening in the alloy is observed after a certain number of cycles. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84873402578	Experimental study on the forming limit diagram of QP980 under variable pressing velocities	QP steel has great application potential for automotive industry for its ultrahigh strength and good plasticity. In this paper, the forming limit diagram (FLD) of QP steel was experimentally studied using spherical punch test. The forming limit curves (FLC) of QP steel in room temperature under two pressing velocities (20mm/s, 2mm/s) were obtained. It has been found that the deformation velocity affects the FLC obviously; the FLC declines with the increase of pressing velocity. Compared with other AHSS under the same strength grade, QP steel keeps high strength without a significant loss of plasticity. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84873980654	Effect of thermo-mechanical process on the microstructure and secondary-deformation behavior of 22MnB5 steels	22MnB5 steel specimens were deformed at 923 K and 693 K to three strain levels to study the effect of applied strain level on the microstructure and secondary-deformation behavior. As the steel was deformed at 923 K, deformation induced ferrite transformation (DIFT) occurred even when a small strain of 0.044 was applied, and the volume fraction of deformation induced ferrite (DIF) increases with increasing applied strain level. When deformed at 693 K, deformation induced bainite transformation (DIBT) was observed when the applied strain was larger than 0.109. The incubation period for DIFT is shorter than that for DIBT, but the DIBT proceeds much faster than DIFT. Sub-size tensile specimens were cut from the hot deformed 22MnB5 steel specimens, and digital image correlation technique was employed to investigate the secondary- deformation behavior of the sub-size tensile specimens at room temperature. It is found that the appearance of DIF or DIB (deformation induced bainite) decreases the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) but increases the elongation and strength-ductility product of the hot deformed 22MnB5 steel specimens compared with the as-quenched 22MnB5 steel specimen with full martensite. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874717655	Effect of thermal exposure on the strength of adhesive-bonded low carbon steel	Recent trends toward economically fabricating lightweight vehicle structures while ensuring structural performance have led to the implementation of crash-toughened adhesive bonding in automotive industry. Adhesive bonding has been shown to offer better fatigue performance and greater flexibility in joining dissimilar materials when compared with resistance spot welding. While a great deal of effort has been focused on studying the performance of adhesive, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of curing conditions encountered in paint baking environment on the mechanical properties of adhesive-bonded workpieces. This study was carried out to determine the effects of curing temperature, curing time and enclosure conditions in the paint oven on the strength of adhesive-bonded structural steels. The enclosure conditions, simulating the exposure of the vehicle interior and exterior parts in paint baking environment, were classified into three types: fully-enclosed, semi-exposed and fully-exposed. Tests were designed and implemented to examine how the adhesive-bonded interior parts would cure in an electro deposition (ELPO) environment. The results showed that enclosure conditions influenced significantly the strength of the bonded steel because of variations in heat convection. The optimum curing temperature and time significantly depend upon the enclosure conditions of the joints. The increase of the curing time or curing temperature is beneficial for improving the strengths of the adhesive-bonded steel joints. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84878885215	Effects of salt spray on the mechanical properties of aluminum-epoxy adhesive joints	The aluminum bonding joints were aged in salt spray fog for various aging time from 0 to 1200 h. Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted for the joints to obtain the residual strength of the joints. The test results showed that the residual strength of the joints increases firstly and then decreases with the aging time in salt spray environment. The mechanism of the spray fog environment effect on the joint residual strength is analyzed by infrared spectral analysis and energy dispersive spectroscopy experiments. It is suggested the effect of aging time in the salt spray fog on the joint residual strength is the competing result of two mechanisms. One positive mechanism is that the adhesive expands after absorbing water in the early aging and reaches its saturation after a certain time, which leads to releasing of the internal stress in joints and consequently increases the joint residual strength. Another negative mechanism is that the water molecules permeating into the adhesive when aged in salt spray fog leads to the plasticization of the adhesive, which results in decreasing the joint residual strength as the aging time increases. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84880015173	Prediction of failure modes and finite element verification of laser tailor welded blanks for vehicle	Tailor welded blanks (TWB's) consist of steel sheets with different materials, thickness, and coating welded into a single flat blank prior to forming in order to meet the different needs for various positions of parts. TWB's provide various advantages, namely, reduction of weight, fuel consumption and air pollution, lower manufacturing costs, and improved structural integrity over conventional sheet metal forming methods. However, the degradation of TWB's formability causes current applications to be limited. In order to take advantage of these benefits, we need to understand the characteristics related to TWB's forming, and especially be able to predict the failure modes during the press forming. Some important factors which influence the failure modes of the TWB's are: the thickness ratio, the base materials combination and the weld properties. To simplify calculation, in the current investigation, the TWB's with similar materials and different thicknesses were considered to study the effect of the thickness ratio on the failure modes. We created a biaxial stretching model consisting of the weld region, the thicker and thinner sides, and further assumed that the strain was equal along the weld direction. The North American Deep Drawing Research Group (NADDRG) model was used to evaluate the formability of the base materials and the weld. The deformation coordinate relationship among the weld element and the adjacent thinner side element at the dangerous point was modeled analytically based on the statistical mechanical theory. The Ludwick-Hollomon power law was employed to characterize the strain-hardening behavior of the base material and the weld. During calculations, thickness average of thinner and thicker sheets was assumed as weld zone thickness. Then a so-called model of critical thickness ratio (CTR) was presented by the analytical method to predict the failure mode of tailor welded blanks (TWB's) during forming. The model demonstrates that the rupture occurs simultaneously at the weld and the thinner side when the weld properties, the base material properties, and the initial thickness ratio meet CTR model. Other parameters keep constant in the CTR model, only the effect of the thickness ratio on the failure modes was considered in this study. If the thickness ratio exceeds CTR, the rupture occurs at the thinner side; otherwise, the rupture occurs at the weld. To verify the effectiveness of the developed CTR model, we carried out the limit bulging height tests for the TWB' s with dissimilar thickness combinations by finite element and experimental methods. The laser TWB's with the base material of DC56D+Z used in experiments were provided by Baosteel Co., Ltd. Tensile tests according to GB/T 228-2002 standards were used to determine the mechanical properties of the base sheets, while miniature samples were used to acquire the mechanical properties of the weld, of which the width was identified by executing the hardness tests. It can also be seen from the hardness analysis results, micro-hardness is not uniformly distributed along the cross-section of TWB' s, which reflects the difference in material hardening behavior across the weld lines. The hardness of the weld metal is higher than that of the HAZ and the base metal. The weld width was approximately estimated at 1.5 mm. According to the analytical model of the CTR, it is necessary to give the strain state of TWB's before the CTR is calculated. The biaxial tension with equal displacements was considered in the investigation. The deformation of the weld was much less than the base material of TWB's in the direction perpendicular to the weld line. We can exclude the effect of the deformation of the weld on the global deformation. The deformation compatibility relationships between the base sheets were only considered in the direction perpendicular to the weld line. The deformations in the two directions parallel and perpendicular to the weld line were equal based on the hypothesis of the biaxial tension with equal displacements. Then, the strain state of the biaxial tension with equal displacements can be determined. Two approaches, excluding and including the weld properties, was used to model the weld of TWB's in the finite element analysis. The failure always occurs at the thinner side of TWB's when modeling the weld using the former method. It occurs at the thinner side when the thickness ratio is large or at the weld when the thickness ratio is small if modeling the weld using the latter method. Comparing the results from the two methods, we can capture the CTR of TWB's. Given the equiaxial strain state, in the case of two TWB's recommended in the published literatures, the critical thickness ratio was achieved through the analytical and FE method. From the comparison of the two results, there were errors between the analytical and FE results, 7.76% and 6.15% respectively, which attributes to the deviation of the strain state in FE analysis from the equiaxial strain state. The results show the presented CTR analytical model is effective and can predict the failure mode of TWB's in the forming process.

84880813089	Research on the initial failure site of weld-bonded automobile aluminum joint under tensile loading	Weld-bonding, as an advanced joining technology, has its unique advantages for connecting automobile aluminum plates. The present work aimed at predicting the initial failure site of weld-bonding aluminum through studying its stress distribution under tensile loading. Firstly, the mechanical properties of adhesive, aluminum substrate and nugget were experimentally determined. Three-dimensional finite element model was then established for analyzing the stress distribution of the weld-bonded aluminum joint; the material risk coefficient, defined based on the maximum stress material endured under tensile loading and its basic mechanical properties, was used for evaluating the initial failure site of weld-bonded aluminum under tensile loading. It has been found the failure in weld-bonded aluminum is more likely to initiate from the adhesive layer. For comparison purpose, material risk coefficients in adhesive-bonded and spot-welded joints have also been studied. It has been found that compared to spot-welded joint, the presence of the adhesive layer in weld-bonded joint can greatly reduce the risk coefficients of both parent aluminum metals and nugget, thereby enhancing the bearing capacity of spot-welded joints. In contrast to the adhesive-bonded joint, the presence of the nugget also slightly reduces the risk coefficients of both base aluminum and adhesive. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

84882999144	Forming limits of Mg alloy ZEK100 sheet in preform annealing process	Preform annealing (PFA) is a new two-stage forming technology with an intermediate annealing step, which extends the formability of light-weight (Al and Mg) alloys that comparable to deep drawing steels. ZEK100 is the only rare-earth containing magnesium sheet alloy that available commercially. The objective of this research is to understand the effect of preform and anneal on the forming limits of ZEK100. Various pre-strain paths and levels were introduced in the preform step followed by an optimum annealing treatment. The total strain-based forming limits of the PFA material are strongly dependent on the pre-strain level and annealing conditions. Based on the strain energy principle, an equivalent strain is employed to evaluate the effects of the pre-strain and anneal on the total limit equivalent strain of the PFA material, which is fitted as a function of the equivalent pre-strain and strain ratio of major strain to minor strain; and there is a critical equivalent pre-strain that leads to the lowest total limit equivalent strain at all strain ratios. Based on this concept, a new forming limit diagram (FLD) is constructed with the equivalent strain and the strain ratio as the horizontal and vertical axes, respectively, to evaluate the formability of Mg sheet in this two-stage forming process with intermediate annealing. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84883003254	Multiphase constitutive model of ultra-high strength steel QP980 coupling with TRIP effect	Q&P steel is a 3rd generation advanced high strength steel with high strength level and excellent plasticity. Balanced mechanical properties attributes to the reasonable microstructure constitution and TRIP effect during deformation. First the microstructure of QP980 was observed by scanned electron microscope, which is the combination of lath martensite, polygonal ferrite and retained austenite. The variation of volume fraction of retained austenite with equivalent strain under uniaxial tensile state was obtained by X-ray diffraction measurement. It turns out the volume fraction of retained austenite decreased nonlinearly with the increasing of equivalent strain. The phase transformation kinetics equation of QP980 was deduced according to O-C theory. At last the multiphase constitutive model of QP980 coupling with TRIP effect was established according to energy conservation and mixed hardening law. It is validated by the comparison with strain stress curve by uniaxial tensile result.

84884496920	A novel method for measuring the weld property of tailor welded blanks based on DIC	A novel method, weld division method, was proposed to measure the mechanical properties of the weld zone in tailor welded blanks (TWBs). The weld zone was divided into the weld and heat affected zone according to the different minor strains in the direction perpendicular to the weld. The digital image correlation technology was employed to capture the strain filed in the TWBs surface when the weld failure occurred. A theoretical model was established to calculate the strength coefficient K and strain-hardening exponent n based on the previously achieved minor strain. To verify the proposed method, the curves of load vs. displacement were produced using finite element method by implementing the parameters from the division method, during uniaxial test of longitudinal weld in laser TWBs. Compared with the results from the rule of mixtures, those from the division method were closer to the experimental results, which indicates that the division method was more accurate.

84885109068	Effect of strain rate on spatio-temporal behavior of Portevin-Le Châtelier bands in a twinning induced plasticity steel	Uniaxial tensile tests at three strain rates are performed with the aid of the digital image correlation (DIC) technique to experimentally investigate the spatio-temporal behavior of PLC bands in a twinning induced plasticity (TWIP) steel. The whole strain fields of tensile specimens are acquired throughout the tests. Significant serration crests corresponding to band nucleation are observed on the true stress vs. true strain curves derived from DIC results beyond a critical true strain. The work hardening exponent (n-value) increases from ∼0.08 to ∼0.5 when true strain increases to the critical true strain, and beyond that, the n-value exhibits serrations with increasing true strain. Two typical nucleation modes of Type-A Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC) bands are observed in all tests. Nucleation and propagation of PLC bands are described in details based on these two nucleation modes of Type-A PLC bands. The PLC band orientation, which indicates the angle between the normal direction of a PLC band and tensile direction, fluctuates during propagation, and the fluctuation amplitude increases during the development of a localized necking band from a PLC band before fracture. In particular, the effect of strain rate on the kinematics of Type-A PLC bands (band strain, band width and band propagating speed etc.) in the TWIP steel is quantitatively analyzed, and a new algorithm based on the DIC results is presented which includes the elongating effect of tensile specimens during deformation to show the actual kinematics of Type-A PLC bands. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84888883354	Analytical method for forming limit diagram prediction with application to a magnesium ZEK100-O alloy	A significant barrier to broader implementation of magnesium alloys is their poor room temperature formability, a consequence of the anisotropic response of the Mg hexagonal closed-packed (hcp) crystal structure. Additions of rare earth (RE) elements, such as in the ZEK100 alloys, weaken the texture and improve formability. Room temperature forming limit analyses of RE-containing Mg alloys, particularly Mg ZEK100, have not been explored to any significant extent in the literature. In this paper, strain-based forming limit diagrams (FLDs) are derived for an Mg ZEK100-O alloy (Zn1.34Zr0.23Nd0.182, wt.%) using an analytical method that combines the vertex theory of Storen and Rice (J Mech Phys Solids, 23:421-441, 1979), the anisotropic yield criterion of Barlat and Lian (Int J Plast, 5:51-66, 1989), and a hardening law. The method does not rely on assumptions about pre-existing defects, is broadly applicable to sheet alloys exhibiting in-plane anisotropy requiring a higher-order yield criterion, and requires only minimal experimental inputs. Results from the analytical method are compared with experimentally derived FLDs based upon the well-known Nakajima test and tensile deformation, and with predictions from an existing analytical method for FLDs. Close agreement between the experimentally derived FLDs and the present theoretical method was obtained. Sheet materials where the theoretical method does not apply are also discussed. © 2013 ASM International.

84896914408	Spatio-temporal characteristics of propagative plastic instabilities in a rare earth containing magnesium alloy	An experimental investigation of the spatio-temporal characteristics of propagative plastic instabilities in quasi-static, room-temperature tensile tests of fully annealed Mg ZEK100, a rare earth containing Mg alloy (0.2 wt.% Nd), is presented with the aid of stereo digital image correlation. Results from specimens aligned with the sheet transverse direction revealed the nucleation of a Lüders band at the fixed specimen end, followed by continuous propagation to, and ultimate termination at, the moving end during yield point elongation (YPE). Serrations in tensile flow curves, observed both during and after YPE, were attributed to propagating deformation bands, similar to the Type A Portevin-Le Châtelier (PLC) bands. Both strain and strain-rate contours enabled exploration of band nucleation and quantification of band kinematics. We also used TEM, EBSD, and electron diffraction to examine microstructural evolution during tensile deformation. Results were used to determine which, if any of the commonly cited microstructural mechanisms, such as diffusing solute pinning of mobile dislocations, precipitate shearing of dislocations, or solute locking of dislocations by a rare earth addition, is responsible for the observed Lüdering and PLC behavior. We found evidence that Lüdering is due to twinning. Although we could not definitively demonstrate a microstructural mechanism that is responsible for PLC effect, pinning and depinning of dislocations via diffusing Zn solute clouds could not be ruled out as the underlying cause. Implications of the experimental results for theoretical model development are discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84898061885	Strain Rate Effect on Forming Limit Diagram for Advanced High Strength Steels	The Forming limit diagram (FLD) is a powerful tool for describing the formability of sheet materials in the automobile industry, which provides fundamental data for die design and Finite Element (FE) simulation. However, traditional FLD testing is typically conducted at quasi-static strain rates from 0.001/s to 0.01/s, which are much lower than the industrial stamping process with strain rates about 1-10/s. In this research, FLDs at various punch speeds (from 1mm/s to 100mm/s or 120mm/s) were obtained for three kinds of AHSS, Quenched and Partitioned steel, Dual Phase 980 and Dual Phase 590 and three kinds of conventional steels, Low Alloy High Strength steel, Bake Hardening steel and IF steel. The results show that FLDs at a typical industrial stamping speed (100mm/s or 120mm/s) are considerably lower than the quasi-static test speed for the Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS). It is suggested that standard Nakazima test or other formability test should be performed at 1-10/s strain rates in order to obtain the experimental data more close to industrial stamping state, especially for AHSS. © 2014 SAE International.

84898478055	Digital image correlation investigation of strain localization of advanced high strength steel	When necking initiated in the sheet metal during forming operations, the quality control of the product is lost and further overall formability of the sheet is limited before ultimate fracture occurs. Two types of necking, diffuse necking and localized necking, are very important indicators to character the formability of sheet metal. In this study, necking behaviour of DP780 high strength steel sheet is investigated. Standard tensile tests are carried out on the MTS testing machine, strain distribution is measured by a full-field digital image correlation (DIC) system. Based on the field measurements, strain evolution at different areas of the specimen are compared, diffuse necking strain and localized necking strain are determined. Strain of diffuse necking is observed through strain bifurcation, strain of localized necking is determined by evaluate the strain acceleration. Post-necking stress strain relationships are identified by introduce a new procedure based on DIC results. Fundamental data for material identification and sheet metal forming analysis are obtained from the tests, and the results provide great potential to identify and improve finite element modeling studies. © 2012 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84921813836	Puerarin protects rat cervical intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus cells: An optimal concentration study	Background: Puerarin restrains the apoptosis of disc annulus fibrosus cells and delays the degenerationof the intervertebral disc. Objective: To explore the protective role of puerarin in rat cervical intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus cells. Methods: Cervical intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus cells were induced by different concentrations of Fas ligand (5, 20, 50 μg/L). The appropriate concentration of puerarin was detected using Annexin V-FITC-PI double staining to establish an in vitro apoptotic model of annulus fibrosus cells. Changes of annulus fibrosus cells in response to different concentrations of puerarin (0.01, 0.1, 1 g/L) were observed by flow cytometry and MTT method. Results and Conclusion: 5 μg/L Fas ligand had no significant influence on the survival rate and early-apoptotic rate of annulus fibrosus cells (P > 0.05). 20 and 50 μg/L Fas ligand significantly promoted annulus fibrosus cells apoptosis (P < 0.01) in a dose-dependent manner. The 0.01, 0.1 and 1 g/L puerarin could improve the survival rate of Fas ligand-induced annulus fibrosus cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). These findings indicate that (1) Fas ligand can induce the disc annulus fibrosus to be in apoptosis status. (2) Puerarin (0.01, 0.1, 1 g/L) can promote the proliferation of disc annulus fibrosus cells in a dose-dependent manner. (3) The apoptosis rate of disc annulus fibrosus cells induced by Fas ligand in vitro can be restrained by puerarin interference.
