1642298927	Performance analysis of optical packet switching employing partially shared buffering and shared wavelength converter	The performance of optical packet switching employing partially shared buffering (PSB) and shared wavelength converter (SWC) for self-similar traffics are studied. The effects of output buffers, the PSBs and SWC on the packet loss probability and delay are analyzed with consideration on the issues, such as dimension of switching matrix, buffering size, etc. The simulation results show that optical packet switching nodes with PSB and SWC are of good performance. The scheme of SWC can obviously reduce the number of wavelength converters in comparison with the scheme employing wavelength converters at each input wavelength path. For fixed depth, grouping PSB into several subgroups can improve the performance of optical packet switching nodes.

14744285810	Studies on tunable F-P cavity based on doped unsaturated polyester	In this work a new method to prepare Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity for optical switch was proposed by filled with unsaturated polyester (UP) resins doped with disperse red 1 (DR 1), and thermal cured in polarization process thereafter. Effects of temperature, initiator and DR 1 content on gel and curing time of UP resins were studied. With increasing content of DR1, the gel time is reduced and the curing time was increased. When the content of DR1 was greater than 5%, the resin is no longer suitable for polarization because of long curing time. However, the gel and curing time of the resin can also be reduced by increasing initiator concentration and improving the temperature. After polarization, the optic loss of total F-P cavity was 5 dB, and electro-optic coefficient γ

The first two levels consist of active interrogation and RNs, respectively. The third level called sensor subnet (SSN) consists of passive FBGs and a few switches. As AOFSN is mainly multiplexed by wired and passive FBGs, the routing algorithm for scanning sensors is determined by the virtual topology of SSN due to the passivity. Therefore, the research concentrates on the construction of SSN and aims at proposing regular and unicursal virtual topology to realize reliable and scalable routing schemes. Two regular types of SSNs are proposed. Each type consists of several sensor cells (SC), square-based SC (SSC) or pentagon-based SC (PSC) and is scaled several times from the SCs. The virtual topologies maintain the self-similar square- or pentagon-like architecture so as to gain simple routing. Finally, the switch architecture of RN is proposed for the reliability of the first two levels; and then, the reliability and scalability of SSN are discussed in view of how much link failures can be tolerant, and how each SC is scaled to maintain the self-similarity, respectively. © 2008 SPIE.

Multiple tokens with the help of control information table (CIT) have been applied to avoid the source and wavelength collision. However, the receiver collision cannot be completely avoided as tokens are processed in a distributed manner. In Round-Robin (RR) queue selection protocol, several bursts destined to the same node may be selected by different tokens simultaneously, resulting in receiver collision. Two novel medium access control (MAC) protocols, called Queue-Grouping based RR (QGRR) and Prior queue-Grouping based RR (PGRR), by scheduling RR manner within special queue groups are proposed to reduce the receiver collision. By further grouping the RR queues according to each wavelength, the probability for different bursts destined to the same node on different wavelengths overlapping in time is significantly reduced.

A cross-correlation method is proposed to analyze the rising and falling speed and width of the image tube gain. Femtosecond pulses generated by a fiber laser are used as the light source of ultrahigh temporal resolution and trapezoid electrical signals are applied to a photocathode electrode as gating pulses. By adjusting the time delay between the laser pulse and the electrical gating pulse, various acceleration procedures for the photoelectrons generated at the photocathode can be observed. The photoelectrons arriving at the multichannel plate (MCP) with different kinetic energies receive different gain according to Eberhardt's MCP gain model. The gain profile is obtained by measuring the output light power of the fluorescent screen at the output port of the tube.

The parameters from the resource layer are abstracted and provided to a cross-layer optimizer to maximize user's utility function. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated through simulations. ©2009 IEEE.

77951763748	Investigation on reliability and scalability of an FBG-based hierarchical AOFSN	The reliability and scalability of large-scale based optical fiber sensor networks (AOFSN) are considered in this paper. The AOFSN network consists of three-level hierarchical sensor network architectures. The first two levels consist of active interrogation and remote nodes (RNs) and the third level, called the sensor subnet (SSN), consists of passive Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBGs) and a few switches. The switch architectures in the RN and various SSNs to improve the reliability and scalability of AOFSN are studied. Two SSNs with a regular topology are proposed to support simple routing and scalability in AOFSN: square-based sensor cells (SSC) and pentagon-based sensor cells (PSC). The reliability and scalability are evaluated in terms of the available sensing coverage in the case of one or multiple link failures. © 2010 by the authors.

79251591078	Efficient sensor node deployment schemes for AOFSN	In this paper, the sensor node deployment schemes are studied for the all optical fiber sensor networks (AOFSN). Sensor node deployment strategy is very crucial to the sensing efficiency in terms of the high sensing accuracy and low sensing cost, etc. High sensing accuracy requires high coverage ratio and low blind ratio, while low sensing cost requires fewer amounts of sensor nodes/switches and low overlapping ratio. Given the above requirements, we apply the concept of close packing and propose two-dimensional Close-Packing based Sensor node Deployment (2-D CPSD) scheme, and the two-dimensional Closest-Packing Sensor node Deployment (2-D CestPSD) scheme. Then the CestPSD scheme is extended to a three-dimensional application and is named as 3-D CestPSD. The AOFSN applying the 2-D/3-D CestPSD schemes can obtain the maximum coverage, minimum blind ratio under the premise of maintaining no overlapping ratio between any two nodes' sensing range. The network performances are numerically analyzed and compared with some other node distribution schemes in terms of coverage ratio, overlapping ratio, blind ratio, and node density. ©2010 IEEE.

78751649433	A cost-effective WDM-PON architecture simultaneously supporting wired, wireless and optical VPN services	It is believed that next-generation passive optical networks (PONs) are required to provide flexible and various services to users in a cost-effective way. To address this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes and demonstrates a novel wavelength-division-multiplexed PON (WDM-PON) architecture to simultaneously support three types of services: 1) wireless access traffic, 2) optical virtual passive network (VPN) communications, and 3) conventional wired services. In the optical line terminal (OLT), we use two cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) on each wavelength channel to generate an optical carrier, and produce he wireless and the downstream traffic using the orthogonal modulation technique. In each optical network unit (ONU), the obtained optical carrier is modulated by a single MZM to provide the VPN and upstream communications. Consequently, the light sources in the ONUs are saved and the system cost is reduced. The feasibility of our proposal is experimentally and numerically verified. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79952163919	Coupling characteristics between two conical micro/nano fibers: Simulation and experiment	The coupling characteristics of conical micro/nano fibers (CMNFs) are investigated using numerical simulations and experiments. Distinct from uniform micro/nano fibers (UMNFs), the coupling efficiency not only depends on the overlapping length between two CMNFs but also the tapering angle of the CMNFs. With the increase of overlapping length, the coupling efficiency gradually converges to a stable value, with its convergence speed determined by the angle of the CMNFs. Experimental result shows the convergent coupling efficiency can be >90%. The spectral response of the coupler shows a "box-shape" profile with a 3-dB bandwidth of 2 nm, resembling a flat-top bandpass filter. And experimental results also show the coupling characteristics of CMNFs are overlapping length and taper angle dependent, which verify the simulation conclusions. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

79953148720	Dynamic correction of the steering-characteristic curve and application to an EPS control system	The steering torque of an electric-power steering (EPS) motor is interrelated with the performance of the EPS control system, therefore calculating an exact steering torque is critical in this application. This study presents a dynamic correction method that greatly decreases the calculated error in the steering torque; the PID controller demonstrated here is therefore suitable for the demands of this system. Based on an analysis of the detection process of the steering torque sensor, we first deduced that the variation of the system resistance torque equals the difference between the measured value of the steering torque and the ideal one in the previous cycle. Based on this result, we then proposed a dynamic correction method. Finally, a comparison of the simulated and experimental results for several vehicles evidenced the effectiveness of this dynamic correction method. © 2011 The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79960752023	Miniature microring resonator sensor based on a hybrid plasmonic waveguide	We propose a compact 1-nm-radius microring resonator sensor based on a hybrid plasmonic waveguide on a silicon-on-insulator substrate. The hybrid waveguide is composed of a metal-gap-silicon structure, where the optical energy is greatly enhanced in the narrow gap. We use the finite element method to numerically analyze the device optical characteristics as a biochemical sensor. As the optical field in the hybrid micoring resonator has a large overlap with the upper-cladding sensing medium, the sensitivity is very high compared to other dielectric microring resonator sensors. The compactness of the hybrid microring resonator is resulted from the balance between bending radiation loss and metal absorption loss. The proposed hybrid microring resonator sensors have the main advantages of small footprint and high sensitivity and can be potentially integrated in an array form on a chip for highly-efficient lab-on-chip biochemical sensing applications. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84863182335	Close-packing-based sensor node deployment schemes for AOFSN	The sensor node deployment schemes are considered for a hierarchical all-optical fibre sensor network (AOFSN), as it mainly affects the sensing accuracy. High sensing accuracy requires high coverage ratio and low blind ratio, while low sensing cost requires less number of sensor nodes/switches and low overlapping ratio. Considering the above requirements, we propose the close-packing based sensor node deployment (CPSD) scheme for two dimensions. Then the CestPSD scheme is extended to three dimensions and is named as 3-D CestPSD. AOFSN applying the 2-D/3-D CestPSD schemes can obtain maximum coverage and minimum blind ratio while maintaining no overlapping ratio. The reliability of AOFSN using 2-D/3-D CestPSD deployment is then discussed and improved by proposing efficient switch architectures and switch deployment schemes. The network performances of sensing accuracy and the reliability of AFOSN are numerically analysed and compared in terms of coverage ratio, overlapping ratio, blind ratio and node density. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

The channel utilization defined in Max-CU-VF is the total length of scheduled BDPs (Burst Data Packet) on a data channel in a limited observing time window. The scheduling time can be decreased due to the elimination of time consumed in searching procedure in comparison with the traditional schedulers based on LAUC-VF (Latest Available Unused Channel with Void Filling). The hardware processing scheme and the corresponding hardware architecture for Max-CU-VF are designed in detail. A 16-channel Max-CU-VF based scheduler is demonstrated on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). A scheduling time of 12.5 ns per BCP (Burst Control Packet) is achieved on the real-time running Max-CU-VF based scheduler. The performance of the Max-CU-VF is also compared with LAUC-VF through NS2 simulation. The results show that the burst loss ratio and the average throughput of Max-CU-VF are close to those of LAUC-VF when the load is light, and the faster Max-CU-VF outperforms the slower LAUC-VF very much when the arrival rate of bursts is over the processing speed of LAUC-VF. Therefore, Max-CU-VF is more suitable for future high speed OBS networks. © 1983-2012 IEEE.
