20344391668	Diagnosis and differentiation of rejection after liver transplantation: Report of 5 cases	Background: The most common complications after liver transplantation are acute and chronic rejection. Although special changes can be found clinically and pathologically in both of them, sometimes other complications such as preservation injury, recurrent disease (HBV) and hepatic artery thrombosis should be differentiated from them. Methods: Five patients with various complications after liver transplantation were synthetically analyzed according to their clinical information, laboratory tests and liver biopsy findings so as to find out the clinical rules and the histological features. Results: Special changes and diagnostic standards were found clinically and pathologically in both acute and chronic rejection. Other complications such as fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis and hepatic artery thrombosis also had their own pathological features. Evaluation of donor liver should be done before liver transplantation. Conclusion: It is very important to understand and master the diagnostic standards of rejection and the major points for its differentiation. © 2005, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

20444445099	Effect of intermittent injection of recombinant human parathyroid hormone on bone mineral density of ovariectomized rats	Aim: To probe into the effect of intermittent injection of recombinant human parathyroid hormone on bone mineral density (BMD) of ovariectomized rats. Methods: The 6-month-old female SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: ovariectomized for placebo injection (OVXE, n = 6), ovariectomized for PTH treatment (OVXEP, n = 6), sham-operated for placebo injection (ShamE, n = 6). During 3-4.5 months after operation, OVXEP rats received daily subcutaneous injection of rhPTH1-84(20 μg/100 g), six times a week for six weeks, while the other 2 groups received PTH solvent injection (PBS of 0.01 acetic acid). The rates of the three groups were measured the BMD of lumbar vertebrae and right proximal femur with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry during 3-4.5 months after operation. Results: The BMD of lumbar vertebrae of OVXE rats at 3 and 4.5 months after ovariectomy changed little (P > 0.05). After 6-week intermittent injection of rhPTH1-84, the BMD of lumbar vertebrae of OVXEP rats had increased by (15.7 ± 9.5) mg/cm

23944474286	Altered expression of myostatin gene in the progressive muscular dystrophy patients	Progressive muscular dystrophy is a group of inherited disorders characterized by progressive skeletal muscle wasting and weakness, which is not of neurogenic origin. Myostatin, a new member of the TGF-β super-family, is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth. To investigate the possible involvement of myostatin in the development of progressive muscular dystrophy, we cloned and sequenced myostatin cDNAs from the progressive muscular dystrophy patients by RT-PCR. Levels of myostatin mRNA and protein in the patients were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. We did not find any mutations in the myostatin cDNA sequences from the progressive muscular dystrophy patients in this study. However, we found that the levels of myostatin transcripts were reduced in some patients and the processing and maturation of myostatin protein were inhibited in some patients. Our data demonstrated that the pathogenesis of some types or subtypes of progressive muscular dystrophy is probably associated with the altered myostatin expression and the processing inhibition of myostatin protein.

2442589516	Insulin like growth factor-1 gene expression abnormality and pathologic changes of nervous electrophysiology and peripheral nerves in experimental diabetic rats	Aim: To explore the relation between insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene expression abnormality of liver tissue and pathologic changes of peripheral nerves in diabetes. Methods: Diabetes was induced in Sprague Dawley(SD) rats by alloxan. Diabetic rats were then subdivided into three groups of 16 rats according to glucose level after control by insulin: insulin-controlled diabetes-1, 2, 3 group. Sisteen normal rats were used as the normal control group. Their sciatic nerves were isolated. The latency, amplitude of evoked potentials (AEP) and the sensory/motor nerve conduction velocity (SNCY/MNCV) were measured with Viking IV evoked electromyography. One gram of liver tissue was removed, the total RNA was extracted The IGF 1 mRNA was determined semi-quantitatively by using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the content of IGF-1 peptide inats according to glucose level after control by insulin: insulin-controlled diabetes-1, 2, 3 group. Sisteen normal rats were used as the normal control group. Their sciatic nerves were isolated. The latency, amplitude of evoked potentials(AEP) and the sensory/motor nerve conduction velocity (SNCY/MNCV) were measured with Viking IV evoked electromyography. One gram of liver tissue was removed. The total RNA was extracted The IGF 1 mRNA was determined semi-quantitatively by using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The content of IGF-1 peptide in liver tissue and that in the serum were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The morphology of sciatic nerves was observed. Results: In the 2nd week of disease course IGF-1 mRNA content in liver tissue was (1.15 ± 0.090) in the control group and (0.79 ± 0.048) in the ID-2 group (P < 0.001); in the 2nd month of disease course, IGF-1 mRNA content was (1.17 ± 0.069) in the control group and (0.53 ± 0.023) in the ID-2 group (P < 0.001). In the 2nd week of disease course the IGF-1 peptide content was (196.66 ± 14.9) μg/g in the control group and (128.2 ± 11.25) μg/g in the ID-2 group (P < 0.001); in the 2nd month of disease course, the IGF-1 peptide content was (196.66 ± 14.9) μg/g in the control group and (74.43 ± 5.33) μg/g in the ID-2 group (P < 0.001). The decrease of IGF-1 m RNA IGF-1 mRNA in diabetic rats with hyperglycemia occurred before the occurrence of electrophysiological abnormality of sciatic nerve. Further developing with the severity of diabetic state, in the 3rd month of disease course, the IGF-1 mRNA was (0.71 ± 0.024) in the ID-2 group and (0.47 ± 0.021) in the ID-3 group; and the IGF-1 peptide was (114.35 ± 8.09) μg/g in the ID-2 group and (64.58 ± 3.89) μg/g in the ID-3 group (P < 0.001). The serum IGF-1 peptide changed was parallelled to that in liver tissue ( r = 0.99, P < 0.001). The changes of IGF-1 mRNA and peptide were closely correlated with the changes of nerve function (for sensory nerve conduction velocity: r = 0.54, P < 0.05, for motor nerve conduction velocity: r = 0.49, P < 0.05) and the structural abnormality of sciatic nerve (for the fiber density: r = 0.68, P < 0.05). No difference was found in the above parameters between the diabetic rats and non-diabetic control rats. Conclusion: IGF-1 gene expression in liver tissue is down-regulated from early diabetic stage, and varies with the severity and duration of diabetic state. Accordingly serum IGF-1 level decreases, indicating that liver tissue is one of the major sources of circulating IGF-1. The decrement in IGF-1 level may contribute to the initiation and development of diabetic pathologic changes of peripheral nerves at least due to impaired endocrinological supply.

2442631659	Linkage analysis of the genetic markers of the candidate genes with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in Chinese families	Objective To explore the relationship between the genetic markers of the candidate genes (insulin receptor, glucose transporter 2 and glucokinase) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in Chinese pedigrees. Methods Genomic DNA of 87 members in 12 Chinese NIDDM pedigrees was amplified using PCR technique. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was applied to detect short tandem repeat polymorphisms. The linkage program was used under the models of autosomal dominant and recessive. The individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) of age ≤45 and age > 45 were counted as affected and unknown status respectively. Results Linkage of insulin receptor gene and NIDDM was strongly and significantly rejected with total LOD score of - ∞ (θ = 0.000). Linkage analysis of glucose transporter 2 gave the result with total LOD score of 2.646 (θ = 0.000) in 4 pedigrees. Linkage of glucokinase and NIDDM was of significance with total LOD score reaching 3. 150 in the integration of 6 pedigrees. Conclusions Mutations in or near the insulin receptor gene are unlikely to be the major cause of inherited predisposition to NIDDM in Chinese pedigrees that are related in this study, not excluding the principal role in the other Chinese or populations, while the mutations/variations near or at the glucose transporter 2 gene locus might be something of the cause, which needs more data to be ascertained, of familial NIDDM in Chinese pedigrees. However, the variations in or near the glucokinase gene might play a dominant role in the development of NIDDM in some Chinese and represent a subgroup of common NIDDM.

2442435814	Effects of hyperglycemia on c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity and p38 phosphorylation in rat myocardial and skeletal muscle	Aim: To explore the effects of C-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 stress activated protein kinases in rats myocardial and skeletal muscles under hyperglycemia for comprehending the nosogenesis in order to and provide frames of reference for clinical diabetic rehabilitation. Methods: In terms of whether Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected or not, twelve of Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighting 200-230g with 12 weeks of age were randomly divided into the following two groups: euglycemia group (n=6) and hyperglycemia group (n=6). Hyperglycemia group as blood glucose over 16 mmol/L in animals was modeled by injection with STZ (65 mg/kg). The rats of euglycemia were managed by neither drug injection nor exercise. Activation of JNK and p38 kinases in myocardial and skeletal muscle was measured by chemiluminescence method. Results: JNK activity in hyperglycemia group increased significantly to 1.8 times in skeletal muscle and 1.4 times in myocardium comparing to euglycemia group. Activity of p38 in hyperglycemia group increased significantly in skeletal muscle (2 times) and myocardium(1.6 times) comparing to euglycemia group. Conclusion: Hyperglycemia activates multiple intracellular signaling pathways of JNK and p38 in myocardial and skeletal muscle, suggesting that intracellular signaling pathways participate in pathological mechanism of diabetes mellitus.

2942530652	Effective expression of human insulin like growth factor-2 in Bombyx mori larvae	AIM: The purpose is to study the efficient expression and production of biologically active recombinant human insulin-like growth factor 2 (rhIGF-2) in the silkworm system by the vector of Bombyx mori Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus (BmNPV). METHODS: A full length IGF-2 cDNA with the start codon was inserted into the BmNPV genome under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. Silkworm larvae (JY1) were used as hosts for the infection with recombinant BmNPV /IGF-2. rhIGF-2 concentration were detected by ELISA, and Western blot was used to find the size of IGF-2, while MTT pathway was involved to study the bioactivity of rhIGF-2 by stimulation the growth of NIH3T3 cell line. RESULTS: It was found that after 48 h after infection, the concentration of IGF-2 in silkworm hemolymph could be detected (1 μg/ml), while at 72 h after infection, the level of rhIGF-2 was tested for 14.00 μg/ml). Mature rhIGF-2 with a size of 7.0 kD was identified by Western blot analysis. It was also showed that rhIGF-2 has excellent bioactivity by stimulated NIH3T3 cell growth. CONCLUSION: Human IGF-2 was highly expressed by the BmNPV expression vector, and this production showed satisfied results both in bioactivity and immunol activity thus providing a very efficient way to produce soluble and biologically active mature rhIGF-2.

Method: A full length IGF-1 cDNA was inserted into BmNPV genome under the control of polyhedrin promoter. Silkworm larvae (JY1) were used as hosts for infection with recombinant BmNPV/IGF-1. rhIGF-1 concentration was tested by ELISA. Immunoaffinity chromatography was used to purify rhIGF-1 expressed in hemolymph. The molecular size was identified by Western blot, and MTT pathway was involved in the study of its bioactivity assay via stimulating the growth of MCF-7 cell line which is a specific useful target cell for testing biological function of IGF-1. Result: It was found that the concentration of rhIGF-1 in silkworm hemolymph was gradually increased (19.09 ∼ 23.74 μg/ml) from 72 h to 120 h post infection, its purity is about 40%. The molecular weight of purified rhIGF-1 was confirmed as 7.5 kD by Western blot analysis and its bioactivity was demonstrated by stimulation of MCF-7 cell growth. Conclusion: Human IGF-1 was highly expressed in BmNPV system. It provided a very efficient way to produce soluble and biologically active mature rhIGF-1.

29744436621	Effect of lovastatin on the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 in the cultured human mesangial cells	AIM: To observe the effect of lovastatin(statin) on the expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the cultured human mesangial cells and the secretion of fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen proteins from them. METHODS: The human mesangial cells was respectively cultured in the medium with low glucose(5.6 mmol/L) and high glucose(30 mmol/L). The expression of IGF-1 mRNA in mesangial cells were observed by RT-PCR method and the concentrations of fibronectin, laminin and type IV collagen in the supernatant were determined by ELISA and radioimmunoassay methods. The extracelluar matrix(ECM) proteins in the supernatant were detected again after addition of lovastatin, cilazapril and both of them on different stimulation time and dosage. The IGF-1 mRNA expression of mesangial cells were also detected on 48 h after stimulation of lovastatin(10 μmol/L) and cilazapril(10 μmol/L). RESULTS: High glucose induced over proliferation of mesangial cells, excessive IGF-1 mRNA expression and the increased secretion of fibronection, laminin and type IV collagen of mesangial cells. Both lovastatin and cilazapril decreased the cell proliferation, the IGF-1 mRNA expression and the level of above extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Lovastatin has more suppressive effect on the expression of IGF-1 mRNA than cilazapril. But combination of them has no more suppressive effect than that single of them. CONCLUSIONS: High glucose stimulates the cultured human mesangial cells to excessively express the IGF-1 and ECM proteins. The high glucose-induced changes can be suppressed by lovastatin and cilazapril. The results suggest that statin has a direct cellular impact on the expression of IGF-1 of mesangial cells. They also indicate that statin have potential preventive action for diabetic nephropathy.

33746700195	Inhibition of atherogenesis in LDLR knockout mice by systemic delivery of adeno-associated virus type 2-hIL-10	Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the arteries. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is known to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine which might be useful for counteracting the development of atherosclerosis. As long-term systemic cytokine delivery is prohibitively expensive, gene therapy might be a suitable approach. To test this idea, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) knockout mice were injected with recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV)/interleukin-10 virus or AAV/granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) virus and then put on a high-cholesterol diet. Upon harvesting the animals at 18 weeks, elevated blood lipids could be documented and AAV/IL-10 and AAV/GM-CSF DNA and mRNA could be found in various mouse organs. The mice receiving the AAV/IL-10 virus had significantly lower levels of atherogenesis (Sudan IV-staining and histology) than the untreated or the AAV/GM-CSF-treated animals, dropping from 53% to 17% (p < 0.05). The aortas of the AAV/IL-10-treated animals displayed higher IL-10 expression and lower CD68 and nitrotyrosine expression. These data are similar to those of Yoshioka et al. [Yoshioka, T, Okada, T, Maeda, Y, et al. Adeno-associatedvirus vector-mediated interleukin-10 gene transfer inhibits atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Gene Ther 2004;11:1772-9] in which AAV/IL-10 was delivered into the tibial muscle of ApoE-deficient mice, instead of tail vein injection used here. These data indicate that systemic AAV/IL-10 gene delivery, with resulting inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress, was able to limit atherogenesis, and suggest that this approach is worthy of further study. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

36649020178	LOX-1 deletion alters signals of myocardial remodeling immediately after ischemia-reperfusion	Objective: Chronic ischemia is associated with alterations in genes that result in myocardial remodeling. An important biochemical basis of cardiac remodeling is generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A few studies have suggested that acute ischemia triggers signals for remodeling. We examined the hypothesis that targeted deletion of lectin-like oxidized-LDL receptor (LOX-1) may inhibit signals related to cardiac remodeling. Methods and results: We generated LOX-1 knockout (KO) mice on C57BL/6 (wild-type mice) background, and subjected wild-type and KO mice to ischemia-reperfusion (I-R). The wild-type mice developed a marked reduction in left ventricular systolic pressure and ± dp/dt

37549029151	Over-expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (agtr2) decreases collagen accumulation in atherosclerotic plaque	Angiotensin (Ang) II, via type 1 receptor activation, exerts a significant role in atherogenesis and collagen synthesis. To test the hypothesis that Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) upregulation delivered with adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV/AT2R) would inhibit collagen synthesis in atherosclerotic arteries, LDLR knockout mice were injected with AAV/AT2R and fed 4% cholesterol diet for 18 weeks. LDLR knockout mice treated with saline or AAV/Neo exhibited extensive vessel wall collagen accumulation, which was reduced by about 50% with AT2R over-expression. AT2R upregulation completely blocked the alterations in the expression of procollagen-I, osteopontin, fibronectin, CD68, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), as well as phosphorylation of p38 and p44/42 MAPKs. Activity of superoxide dismutase was reduced in the LDLR KO mice and it increased with AT2R upregulation. This study demonstrates that AT2R over-expression reduces enhanced collagen accumulation, MMP expression and activity in atherosclerotic regions via inhibition of pro-oxidant signals. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

37549046852	LOX-1 abrogation reduces myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice	LOX-1 is a newly described lectin-like receptor for oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL), which is over-expressed in the ischemic myocardium. To examine the pathogenic role of LOX-1 in the determination of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury to the heart, we developed LOX-1 knockout (KO) mice, and subjected these mice to 60 min of left coronary artery occlusion followed by 60 min of reperfusion. I-R in the LOX-1 KO mice resulted in a significant reduction in myocardial injury as well as in accumulation of inflammatory cells in the I-R myocardium and lipid peroxidation (P < 0.01 vs. wild-type mice). Concomitantly, there was significant preservation of cardiac function in the LOX-1 KO mice despite I-R (P < 0.01 vs. the wild-type mice). The phosphorylation of oxidative stress-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) and protein kinase B/Akt-1, expression of nitrotyrosine and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and superoxide dismutase activity were enhanced during I-R in the wild-type mice. These alterations in p38MAPK, Akt-1 and iNOS were much less pronounced in the LOX-1 KO mice. The superoxide dismutase activity increased further in the LOX-1 KO mice. These observations provide compelling evidence that LOX-1 may be a key modulator of myocardial I-R injury, and its effect is mediated by pro-oxidant signals. LOX-1 may be a potential target for therapy of myocardial ischemic injury. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0034142774	Mitochondrial gene variation in type 2 diabetes mellitus: Detection of a novel mutation associated with maternally inherited diabetes in a Chinese family	Objective To explore the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the mutation(s) in mitochondrial DNA. Methods According to the previous literature, the fragment of mitochondrial DNA from nucleotide 3153 to 3551, which had shown high frequency of point mutation, was scanned with the technique of polymerase chain reaction - single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) in Chinese normal control, type 2 diabetic population, and 12 families suffered from maternally inherited type 2 diabetes mellitus. Direct sequencing was applied to detect the fragments with abnormal conformation. Results No special band was found in SSCP electrophoreses in Chinese normal control, and only one subject (No. 81) of diabetic population indicated the abnormality in SSCP study, which was affirmed to be a silent point mutation of T to C at nucleotide 3336 inducing no change in amino acid (ATT→ATC, lle ) . Pedigree 25 001 was the only family that exhibited strongly different SSCP characteristic from the other 11 ones, which was confirmed to be caused by a single point mutation mt3285T→C/T in the coding region of tRNA

31744439732	Effect of methalcobalamin on down regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 gene expression and prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy	Background: Diabetes causes abnormal insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene expression, which contributes to initiation and development of peripheral neuropathy. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of a single dose of methylcobalamin on prevention of experimental diabetic neuropathy and the possible molecular mechanism of its involvement in IGF-1 gene expression. Design: Completely randomized and controlled experiment. Setting: Endocrinology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Materials: The study was carried out in an Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University. Totally 80 male Sprague Dawley rats (sanitary degree) were randomly selected. Methods: 1 Totally 64 rats were chosen to be induced diabetic. They were injected intravenously with alloxan dissolved in saline solutions, at the dose of 240 mg /kg. 2 Of 16 rats were chosen as normal control group who were injected intravenously with equivalent volume of saline solution. 3 Of 64 established diabetic rats were treated with daily subcutaneous injection of pork regular insulin in combination of protamine zinc insulin (2:1) then further divided into 2 groups as insulin-treatment diabetic control groups based on different blood glucose levels: group 1 with relatively better control of diabetes, group 2 with relatively worse control of diabetes, with 32 rats in each group. Totally 16 rats of each group were treated with methylcobalamin injection intramuscularly with 500 μg/kg body weight, thus correspondingly divided into insulin +methylcobalamin group 1 and insulin+methylcobalamin group 2. The remaining 16 rats of each group as respective insulin-treatment diabetic control groups were treated with equivalent volume of saline. 4 Initiate weight and end weight were measured at beginning of the experiment and after diabetic model was established. Glucose oxidase was used to detect glucose level. 1-deoxy-1-malin was used to detect fructose level. 5 Parameters were measured as follows: Sensory/motor nerve conduction velocity (SNCV, MNCV) and evoked potential amplitude (EPA) of sciatic nerves detected by evoked electromyogram; IGF-I mRNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); IGF-1 peptide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 6 One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the Significance of differences among groups. Main outcome measures: 1 Tissue IGF-1 mRNA/ IGF-1 peptide, electrophysiological data of individual groups at different points of the experiment. 2 Comparison between individual groups in glucose metabolic parameters and body weights at different points of the experiment. Results: Three rats died for diabetic infection or other acute complications and only 77 rats were included in the final statistical analysis. 1 Body weight and glucose metabolic parameter changes: After diabetic model, glucose, fructose level and body weight change between methylcobalamin +insulin treated groups and insulin treated groups were not significant. 2 IGF-1 mRNA/peptide changes: Tissue IGF-1 mRNA increased significantly in methylcobalamin + insulin treated groups than that in insulin treated groups, respectively (P < 0.05-0.01). Two weeks after diabetic model was established, the sciatic tissue IGF-1 mRNA contents were obviously higher in methylcobalamin + insulin treated group 1 than that in insulin treated group 1 (P < 0.05), but not significantly different from that in NC group; Similarly, tissue IGF-1 mRNA contents were obviously higher in methylcobalamin + insulin treated group 2 than that in insulin treated group 2 (P < 0.05), but lower than that in NC group (P < 0.01); Month 2, tissue IGF-1 contents in methylcobalamin+ insulin treated groups were lower significantly than NC groups, but higher than insulin treated groups (P < 0.05-0.01). By month 3, IGF-1 mRNA level in methylcobalamin+ insulin treated group 2 was not significantly different from that in insulin treated group 2. The IGF-1 peptide levels in nerve tissue changed approximately parallel to IGF-1 mRNA level over time course. 3 Nerve electrophysiological data changes: Month 2 and 3, SNCV, MNCV and EPA were significantly higher in methylcobalamin+ insulin treated group 1 than in insulin treated group 1 (P < 0.05); Month 2, SNCV and EPA were higher in methylcobalamin+ insulin treated group 2 than in insulin treated group 2 (P < 0.05); Month 3, SNCV, MNCV and EPA were significantly lower in methylcobalamin + insulin treated group 2 than in control group (P < 0.05-0.01), whereas no difference was observed between methylcobalamin+ insulin treated group 2 and insulin treated group 2. Conclusion: 1 Methylcobal has not effect on blood glucose. 2 Methylcobal could prevent occurrence of experimental neuropathy through its effect on nerve IGF-1 gene expression of diabetic rats. 3 A better efficacy could be achieved by Methylcobal with a good control of blood glucose level in prevention of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

41349108023	Correlation between NDRG1 and PTEN expression in endometrial carcinoma	N-myc Downstream-Regulated Gene 1 (NDRG1) is known as a differentiation-related gene that plays important roles in cell differentiation, organ formation, and embryonic development. NDRG1 has recently been shown to be associated with carcinogenesis and tumor progression in a wide variety of tumors. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome (PTEN), a phosphatase and tensin homolog located on chromosome 10, is shown to be a tumor suppressor and is often mutated or deleted in various tumor cells, particularly in endometrial carcinoma. Using an immunohistochemical approach, we investigated the expression of NDRG1 and PTEN in normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma. All tumor tissues harvested in this study were derived from endometrioid carcinoma Type I, that were estrogen-related. Our results demonstrate that the expression of NDRG1 was up-regulated in 5/40 (12.5%), 18/34 (52.94%), and 86/103 (83.5%) normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma cases, respectively (P<0.01), while in 6/40 (15%), 20/34 (58.82%), and 89/103 (86.41%) normal endometrium, atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial carcinoma cases, respectively. PTEN expression was significantly decreased (P<0.01). Statistical analyzes demonstrated a positive correlation between NDRG1 up-regulation and PTEN down-regulation (P<0.01). The expression of NDRG1 had no correlation with the differentiation degree of the tumor cells, lymph-node metastasis, and/or abdominal cavity implantation (P>0.05). Our results indicated that development of endometrial carcinoma is associated with an overexpression of NDRG1 and the loss of PTEN expression. Identification of changes in the NDRG1 and PTEN expression may be a significant diagnostic tool for the early detection of endometrial carcinoma. © 2008 Japanese Cancer Association.

0034308625	The effects of glucose, insulin and oxidized low density lipoprotein on apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells	Objective To study the effects of high concentrations of glucose, insulin and oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) on apoptosis in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs). Methods For qualitative determination of EC apoptosis, acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) staining and DNA agarose gels electrophoresis were used. Cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA measured apoptosis by quantitating the fragmentation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeled DNA. Results High concentrations of glucose (20 mmol/L, 40 mmol/L), insulin (3000 μU/ml) and ox-LDL (50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml) induced concentration- and time-dependent apoptosis in ECs. They had a synergetic effect on EC apoptosis. The combined effect of high concentration of glucose, insulin and ox-LDL was greater than any two of them; the effect of two was greater than one alone. Low concentration of insulin (30 μU/ml) decreased apoptosis in ECs induced by high concentrations of glucose (40 mmol/L), but no similar effect occurred with ox-LDL (100 μg/ml). Conclusion High ambient glucose, insulin and ox-LDL can induce excessive apoptosis in cultured ECs, and low ambient insulin can prevent EC apoptosis. Excessive EC apoptosis induced by the separate or synergetic effect of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia may be one of the reasons for loss of endothelial integrity, dysfunction of the vascular endothelium and increased plasma membrane permeability, which are all involved in the development of diabetic macrovascular complications.

84861505556	Relation of homocysteine to early nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes	Aim: To explore the relationship between plasma total homocysteine concentration and diabetic nephropathy in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Methods: Chinese patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 183) were enrolled in a cross-sectional hospital based study. Early diabetic nephropathy status was documented by presence of microalbuminuria. Plasma total homocysteine concentration was measured using fluorescence polarization immunoassay. Traditional risk factors for diabetic nephropathy were obtained from fasting blood samples and interviewer-questionnaire. Results: Plasma total homocysteine levels were higher in subjects with early diabetic nephropathy than without (13.3 ± 2.9) μmol/l vs. (8.5 ± 1.4) μmol/l, p < 0.01). The association of homocysteine with the diabetic nephropathy was independent of major traditional risk factors for diabetic nephropathy (duration of diabetes, HbA1c, and blood pressure) and determinants of higher homocysteine concentration (age, gender, serum folate and vitamin B12, serum cystatin and creatinine levels, and Biguanide use) (OR: 1.37 (0.89 - 2.24), p < 0.05). Furthermore, per increase of 4.0 μmol/l plasma homocysteine was related to nephropathy, after controlling for per unit increase of other factors (OR: 1.15 (0.94 - 1.29), p < 0.05). Conclusion: Plasma total homocysteine concentration was independently associated with occurrence of early diabetic nephropathy in Chinese patients. Future prospective studies are warranted to clarify the relationship. © 2012 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

Activation of LOX-1, a lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1, exerts a significant role in collagen formation. We examine the hypothesis that LOX-1 deletion may inhibit collagen accumulation in atherosclerotic arteries in LDL receptor (LDLR) knockout (KO) mice. Methods and results: We generated LOX-1 KO and LOX-1/LDLR double KO mice on a C57BL/6 (wild-type mice) background and fed a 4% cholesterol/10% cocoa butter diet for 18 weeks. Vessel wall collagen accumulation was increased in association with atherogenesis in the LDLR KO mice (P < 0.01 vs. wild-type mice), but much less so in the double KO mice (P < 0.01 vs. LDLR KO mice). Collagen accumulation data were corroborated with pro-collagen I measurements. Expression/activity of osteopontin, fibronectin, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) was also increased in the LDLR KO mice (P < 0.01 vs. wild-type mice), but not in the mice with LOX-1 deletion (P < 0.01 vs. LDLR KO mice). The expression of NADPH oxidase (p47

47649128227	Over-expression of angiotensin II type 2 receptor (agtr2) reduces atherogenesis and modulates LOX-1, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heme-oxygenase-1 expression	Atherogenesis is associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Activation of renin-angiotensin system with generation of angiotensin II and type 1 receptor (AT1R) stimulation has been amply reported in atherosclerosis. Since angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) activity is purported to oppose the effects of AT1R, we hypothesized that AT2R (agtr2) over-expression would inhibit atherogenesis. We prepared recombinant adeno-associated virus type-2 (AAV) carrying AT2R cDNA (AAV/AT2R), and homozygous LDLR-deficient (KO) mice were given AAV/AT2R, AAV/Neo or saline. All mice were placed on a high cholesterol diet. After 18 weeks, AT2R was found to be over-expressed systemically in AAV/AT2R-treated mice. Atherogenesis in aorta was reduced in the AAV/AT2R group by ≈50% compared to other LDLR KO mice groups. Expression of NADPH oxidase, nitrotyrosine and NF-κB was increased in aortic tissues of the LDLR KO mice given saline or AAV/Neo, but not in mice with AT2R upregulation. Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was decreased and that of the lectin-like oxidized-LDL receptor (LOX-1) increased in the LDLR KO mice, but not in the mice with AT2R over-expression. Further, Akt-1 phosphorylation was reduced in the LDLR KO mice, but not in the mice with AT2R over-expression. Thus, AT2R upregulation can reduce atherogenesis, possibly by modulating oxidative stress and the pro-inflammatory cascade, mediated via Akt-1. Over-expression of AT2R may be an important therapeutic approach in atherosclerosis. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

51349097817	N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 as a downregulated target gene of PTEN in the controlling of tumourigenesis in endometrioid carcinoma	Background & objectives: Mutation/deletion of PTEN has been known to be involved in the development of many cancers including endometrial carcinoma. NDRGI (N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1) is reported to be associated with tumourigenesis. PTEN expression has been shown to be correlated with NDRG1 in both prostate and breast cancer. In this study, we explored the possibility that PTEN alteration may cause carcinogenesis of endometrioid carcinoma by regulating the expression of the NDRG1 gene. Methods: Tissue blocks of 103 patients with pathologically confirmed endometrioid carcinoma were included. All the carcinoma tissues were accompanied with varied degree of necrosis. Using two-step method and avidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemistry method, the correlation of the two genes expression in ischaemic area and the relationship of NDRG1 expression between ischaemic and non-ischaemic area in endometrioid carcinomas was evaluated. Results: PTEN alteration and NDRG1 expressions were significantly increased in the ischaemic area of endametrioid carcinoma compared with their expressions in the normal endometrium respectively (P<0.001, P<0.001). A positive correlation was found between PTEN alteration and NDRG1 expression in the ischaemic area of endometrioid carcinoma. Interpretation & conclusions: We suggest that NDRG1 may be an important candidate gene in facilitating endometrium carcinogenesis in the adaptation of hypoxia for survival. Alteration of PTEN may upregulate NDRG1 expression, which plays an important role in the process leading to endometrial carcinogenesis.

Methods: The expression of Skp2 protein and HPV16/18 DNA was determined using immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization in 30 cases of normal cervical squamous epithelium, 29 cases of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 31 cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and 31 cases of cervical SCC. Results: Skp2 expression was not detected in normal cervical squamous epithelium and no significant difference was obtained statistically on Skp2 expression between normal cervical squamous epithelium and low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (P > 0.05). However, the expression of Skp2 gradually increased with elevation of epithelial lesion grading in an order from low to high grade and to cervical SCC (P < 0.01). The positive rate of HPV16/18 DNA in cases of normal cervical squamous epithelium, low-grade, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical SCC was significantly different (P < 0.01), although both high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical SCC had a similar high HPV infection rate up to 96.8%. There was no correlation obtained between Skp2 expression and HPV16/18 infection in low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. In contrast, expression of Skp2 and HPV infection were significantly correlated in both high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical SCC (γ

70449631049	Islet neogenesis-associated protein-related pentadecapeptide enhances the differentiation of islet-like clusters from human pancreatic duct cells	The differentiation of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells into β-cells has been considered as an alternative method for increasing the number of islets for transplantation. Critical factors have been introduced into the in vitro differentiation protocol for pancreatic duct cells in order to enhance the production of β-cells. Islet neogenesis-associated protein (INGAP) is an initiator of islet neogenesis and the peptide sequence 104-118 of INGAP has been shown to stimulate an increase in β-cell mass in animals and also found in human pathological states involving islet neogenesis. To establish a novel method for the differentiation of β-cells from human pancreatic duct cells with INGAP-related pentadecapeptide (INGAP-PP), the pancreatic duct cells were isolated, purified and expanded in vitro and differentiated using a four-step protocol that included nicotinamide, exendin-4, transforming growth factor β

However, limited information is available on the effects of ropivacaine (a new local anesthetic) on neutrophil function. The aim of this study was to investigate anti-inflammatory properties of ropivacaine with regard to its effects on the expression and function of CD11b in human neutrophils. CD11b expression was examined by flow cytometry and its function was determined by measuring adhesion of neutrophils to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Ropivacaine inhibited CD11b expression in formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-activated neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner, but not in a time-dependent manner. The inhibitory potency of ropivacaine was similar to that of bupivacaine and levobupivacaine, but was more potent than that of lidocaine. The up-regulation of CD11b induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) priming was also inhibited by ropivacaine. fMLP increased adhesion of neutrophils to HUVECs, which was inhibited by ropivacaine. In addition, ropivacaine more potently inhibited the fMLP-induced CD11b expression in the presence of ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N ́,N ́-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), a chelator of extracellular Ca

77953469165	The relationship between NDRG-1 gene expression and the progression and metastasis of uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma	Objective:To investigate the relationship between N-myc downstream-regulated gene-1 (NDRG-1) gene expression and the progression and metastasis of uterine cervical squamous cell carcinoma (UCSCC). Methods: NDRG-1 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 42 cases of UCSCC, 30 cases of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), 28 cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and 20 cases of normal squamous epithelium. NDRG-1 mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 10 cases of UCSCC and 10 cases of normal squamous epithelium. Results: The expressions of NDRG-1 mRNA and protein in UCSCC were significantly lower than normal squamous epithelium tissues (P < 0.01). From normal squamous epithelium to LSIL, HSIL and UCSCC, NDRG1 protein was gradually decreased during tumor carcinogenesis. The difference was significant (P < 0.01). NDRG-1 mRNA and protein in metastatic UCSCC were obviously lower than non metastatic UCSCC (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Down-regulation of NDRG1 mRNA and protein in UCSCC indicate that NDRG1 gene might correlate with carcinogenesis, progression, and metastasis of cervical squamous carcinoma.

79851493070	Aspirin and pravastatin reduce lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1 expression, adhesion molecules and oxidative stress in human coronary artery endothelial cells	Background Oxidative stress and inflammation are important steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We postulated that therapeutic concentrations of aspirin and pravastatin, especially in combination, may suppress oxidative stress and inflammation in endothelial cells, and this concept was examined in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). Methods Human coronary artery endothelial cells were cultured and treated with oxidized-low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 60 μg/ml for 24 hours) alone, or pre-treated with aspirin (1, 2 or 5 mmol/L), pravastatin (1, 5 or 10 μmol/L) or their combination (1 mmol/L aspirin and 5 μmol/L pravastatin), followed by ox-LDL treatment. After respective treatment, superoxide anion production, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and transcription factor NF-κB activation, protein expression of lectin-like ox-LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) and adhesion molecules, and monocyte adhesion were measured. Results Ox-LDL treatment greatly elicited its receptor LOX-1 expression, superoxide anion production and inflammatory response, which were minimally affected by low concentration of aspirin (1 mmol/L) or pravastatin (5 μmol/L), but were markedly decreased by their combination. Activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and NF-κB, the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, which were only mildly affected by aspirin or pravastatin alone, were significantly attenuated by their combination. As a consequence, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells was markedly attenuated by the combination of the two agents. Well-known anti-oxidants α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol had similar inhibitory effects on ox-LDL-mediated oxidative stress and LOX-1 expression as well as monocyte adhesion as did the combination of aspirin and pravastatin. Conclusions These studies point to a positive interaction between aspirin and pravastatin with regard to endothelial biology. Anti-oxidant and subsequent anti-inflammatory effect may be one of the potential underling mechanisms.

79953186124	Expression of PTEN, HIF-lα and NDRG1 in endometrioid carcinoma and their correlations	Objective To investigate the role of aberrant expression of PTEN, HIF-la and NDRG1 protein in the pathogenesis and progression of endometrioid carcinoma. Methods Tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were employed to detect the expression of PTEN, HIF-la and NDRG1 in tissues of type I endometrial carcinoma (n = 124) and atypical hyperplasia (n =28) and normal endometrial tissues (n = 35). The relationship among the markers, as well as their correlations with clinic op at ho logical features were evaluated. Results The expression of PTEN, HIF-lα and NDRG1 in tissues of endometrioid carcinoma was 29.8%, 61.3% and 52.4%, respectively, and was significantly different from that in tissues of atypical hyperplasia and normal endometrial tissues (P <0. 01). The downregulation of expression of PTEN and overexpression of NDRG1 were significantly related to the tumor differentiation (P < 0. 05), and the expression of HIF-1 a protein was significantly related to the tumor differentiation, myometrial invasion and lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05). The expression of PTEN was negatively related to that of HIF-lα and NDRG1 in tissues of endometrioid carcinoma (r= -0.314, P<0.01, r= -0.296, P = 0. 001), and the expression of HIF-lα protein was positively related to that of NDRG1 (r = 0.237, P=0.008). Conclusion The absence of PTEN may upregulate the expression of HIF-lα and NDRG1 protein, which may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of endometrioid carcinoma, and the combined detection of these markers is of great value in the prediction of tumor behavior and prognosis.

79955405216	Identification of NDRG1-regulated genes associated with invasive potential in cervical and ovarian cancer cells	N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is an important gene regulating tumor invasion. In this study, shRNA technology was used to suppress NDRG1 expression in CaSki (a cervical cancer cell line) and HO-8910PM (an ovarian cancer cell line). In vitro assays showed that NDRG1 knockdown enhanced tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion activities without affecting cell proliferation. cDNA microarray analysis revealed 96 deregulated genes with more than 2-fold changes in both cell lines after NDRG1 knockdown. Ten common upregulated genes (LPXN, DDR2, COL6A1, IL6, IL8, FYN, PTP4A3, PAPPA, ETV5 and CYGB) and one common downregulated gene (CLCA2) were considered to enhance tumor cell invasive activity. BisoGenet network analysis indicated that NDRG1 regulated these invasion effector genes/proteins in an indirect manner. Moreover, NDRG1 knockdown also reduced pro-invasion genes expression such as MMP7, TMPRSS4 and CTSK. These results suggest that regulation of invasion and metastasis by NDRG1 is a highly complicated process. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79955755448	Involvement of EphB1 receptor/ephrinB1 ligand in bone cancer pain	In prior studies, Eph/ephrin system was demonstrated to be involved in inflammatory and neuropathic pain modulation. The present study was to investigate whether the spinal Eph/ephrin signaling was involved in modulation of spinal inflammatory cytokines in bone cancer pain (BCP) of rats. BCP was induced by intra-tibial inoculation of Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma cells. The expressions of EphB1/ephrinB1 in spinal cord (SC) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were determined. At 16 days post inoculation, the pain relieving effect and the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected after intrathecal administration of EphB1-Fc (blocker of EphB1 receptor, 10 μg). The results showed that the EphB1/ephrinB1 expression was significantly increased in SC, but ephrinB1 was decreased in DRG after Walker 256 inoculation. The mechanical allodynia induced by bone cancer was significantly alleviated by intrathecal administration of EphB1-Fc. Furthermore, the RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly increased at 16 days post Walker 256 inoculation and were significantly suppressed by intrathecal administration of EphB1-Fc in SC. We concluded that Eph/ephrin might be involved in the maintenance of mechanical allodynia, via modulating the expression of spinal inflammatory cytokines, in the present rat model of BCP. This study suggested that Eph/ephrin signaling would be a potential target for the treatment of BCP. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79955839664	Functional polymorphisms in cell death pathway genes FAS and FAS ligand and risk of prostate cancer in a Chinese population	Background Apoptosis is the physiological mechanism of programmed cell death and abnormal regulation of this pathway can lead to carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that the FAS -1377G>A, -670A>G, and FASL -844T>C polymorphisms are associated with risk of prostate cancer (PCa). MATERIALS and Methods We genotyped polymorphisms in a hospital-based case-control study of 602 patients diagnosed with PCa and 703 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Results We found a significantly decreased risk associated with FAS -1377GA [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.56-0.90] genotype compared with the -1377GG genotype and decreased risk associated with FAS -670AG and -670GG genotypes (OR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.95; OR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.96) compared with the -670AA genotype. Consistently, we found that individuals carrying haplotype genotype with 0 or 1 risk allele (-1377G and -670A) had a lower risk of PCa than those with two risk alleles (OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.28-0.80; OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.41-0.87; OR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.97 for the AA, GG, and AG haplotype, respectively). In addition, when we evaluated these two FAS polymorphisms together, we found that the combined genotype with 4 risk alleles was associated with a significantly increased risk of PCa compared with those with 0-3 variants (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19-1.91), and this increased risk was more pronounced among subgroups of Gleason score <7 and >7, and PSA>20ng/ml (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.08-2.04; OR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.25-2.44; OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.23-2.13, respectively).

80054763444	Genetic polymorphisms in APE1 are associated with renal cell carcinoma risk in a Chinese population	Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a DNA repair protein, which plays important roles in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Genetic variations of APE1 have been shown to influence an individual's susceptibility to carcinogenesis. We hypothesized the genetic polymorphisms of APE1 are associated with the risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In a case-control study of 612 RCC patients and 632 age and sex matched healthy controls, we genotyped two APE1 functional polymorphisms (-656 T>G, rs1760944 and 1349 T>G, rs1130409) and assessed their associations with risk of RCC.

80054766722	GPx-1 polymorphism (rs1050450) contributes to tumor susceptibility: Evidence from meta-analysis	Purpose: Accumulating evidences implicate the selenium-containing cytosolic glutathione peroxidase, GPx-1, as a determinant of cancer risk and a mediator of the chemopreventive properties of selenium. Since the identification of a well-characterized functional polymorphism named Pro198Leu (rs1050450 C>T) in GPx-1, abundant studies have evaluated the association between Pro198Leu polymorphism and tumor risk in diverse population. But, the available results are conflicting. Methods: To derive a more precise estimation, we performed a meta-analysis based on 14,372 cases with different tumor types and 18,081 controls from 31 published case-control studies. Published literature from PubMed was retrieved. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. Results: Overall, the results indicated that individuals who carried variant Leu allele (Pro/Leu and Leu/Leu) were associated with an increased cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.23] in a dominant genetic model. In further subgroup analyses, the increased risk of cancer was observed in subgroup of Asians and sample size more than 500 subjects. Conclusion: These results suggest that the GPx-1 Pro198Leo polymorphism contributes to cancer susceptibility through a disturbed antioxidant balance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

82555193679	Modulation of cardiac fibroblast function by thiazolidinediones with a focus on the role of LOX-1	Cardiac fibroblasts play a pivotal role in cardiac remodeling. In response to various pro-fibrotic stimuli, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, anoxia-reoxygenation and pressure overload as well as aging, cardiac fibroblasts undergo proliferation, migration and activation, leading to the accumulation of extracellular matrix components and increased thickness and stiffness of heart. The ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, especially thiazolidinediones, modulate the function of cardiac fibroblasts and the progression of cardiac remodeling, especially under pathological conditions. Unfortunately these agents have not been found to be consistently beneficial in heart failure. Although the precise intracellular signaling pathways are not fully understood, existing evidence strongly supports the involvement of oxidative stress and related signaling pathways. Further, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 together play critical roles in thiazolidinediones- modulated cardiac fibroblast dysfunction.

84856226956	Propofol protects against high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	BACKGROUND: Hyperglycemia, via peroxynitrite-mediated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) enzymatic uncoupling, induced endothelial dysfunction. Propofol has been reported to improve high glucose-induced endothelial dysfunction. However, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. We hypothesized that propofol could improve hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction by decreasing the peroxynitrite level and thus restoring eNOS coupling. METHODS: At the end of 3 days of incubation in medium with 30 mM glucose, human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with different concentrations (0.2, 1, 5, and 25 μM) of propofol for different times (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours).

84856245229	Functional promoter -31G>C variant in survivin gene is associated with risk and progression of renal cell cancer in a Chinese population	Background: Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein and is involved in the occurrence and progression of human malignancies. Recently, a functional polymorphism (-31G>C, rs9904341) in the promoter of survivin has been shown to influence its expression and confer susceptibility to different types of cancer. The present study was aimed to investigate whether the polymorphism also influences susceptibility and progression of renal cell cancer (RCC) in a Chinese population. Methods: We genotyped this polymorphism using the TaqMan assay in a case-control study comprised of 710 RCC patients and 760 controls. The logistic regression was used to assess the genetic association with occurrence and progression of RCC.

This study was aimed to clarify the influence of VHL and HIF1A polymorphisms on renal cell cancer (RCC) susceptibility and survival. Subjects and methods: We genotyped four potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs779805 in VHL and rs11549465, rs11549467, and rs2057482 in HIF1A) and assessed their associations with RCC risk, clinicopathologic parameters in a case-control study of 620 patients and 623 controls, and the prognosis of RCC in a cohort of 311 patients.

In our study, we assessed whether these polymorphisms are also associated with RCC risk in a Chinese population. We genotyped these polymorphisms using TaqMan method and assessed their associations with RCC risk in a case-control study of 710 patients with histologically confirmed RCC and 760 cancer-free controls. Normal renal tissues adjacent to tumors were used to evaluate the functional consequences of these polymorphisms. We found that rs7105934 was significantly associated with reduced RCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.67, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.47-0.95, GA+AA versus GG], particularly among subgroups of normal-weight individuals (OR = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.29-0.88), never-smokers (OR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.33-0.85) and non-drinkers (OR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.370.87). Furthermore, the rs7105934 GA genotype was associated with lower levels of CCND1 mRNA compared with GG genotype, although this association was only marginally significant (P = 0.055). No significant association between rs7579899 or rs7105934 and RCC risk was observed. Our results suggest that rs7105934 on 11q13.3 may confer susceptibility to RCC in our population. Large population-based prospective and functional studies are required to validate the associations between these loci and RCC risk. © The Author 2011.

84860167713	The interleukin-10-1082 promoter polymorphism and cancer risk: A meta-analysis	Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a multifunctional cytokine with both immunosuppressive and anti-angiogenic properties and play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer. IL-10-1082A>G polymorphism is the most extensively studied polymorphism in the IL-10 gene in cancer susceptibility. To date, a number of case-control studies were conducted to investigate the association between IL-10-1082A>G polymorphism and cancer risk in humans. However, the association between the IL-10-1082A>G polymorphism and cancer risk is still ambiguous. In an effort to solve this controversy, we performed a meta-analysis based on 61 case-control studies, including 14499 cancer cases and 16967 controls. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association. In the stratified analyses by specific cancer type, increased risk was found in lung cancer (OR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.16-8.63 for GA versus AA; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.16-3.70 for GG versus AA; OR = 3.17, 95% CI = 1.31-7.68 for GA/GG versus AA) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.02-1.36 for GA versus AA; OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.02-1.35 for GA/GG versus AA). The meta-analysis also indicated that the variant genotypes were associated with a moderately increased risk in Asians in all genetic models (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.17-2.76 for GA versus AA; OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.62-6.82 for GG versus AA; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.07-2.60 for GA/GG versus AA; OR= 2.93, 95% CI = 1.43-6.03 for GG versus AA/GA). The meta-analysis suggested that the IL-10-1082A>G polymorphism was associated with increased risk of cancer in Asians and lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To draw comprehensive and true conclusions, more researches with larger numbers of worldwide participants are needed to examine associations between IL-10-1082A>G polymorphism and cancer risk. © The Author 2011.

84861403891	Association between VHL single nucleotide polymorphism (rs779805) and the susceptibility to prostate cancer in Chinese	The Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is a crucial regulator of the hypoxia response pathway and plays an important role in tumorigenesis, particularly in tumor growth and vascularization. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in the functional region of VHL may influence susceptibility to prostate cancer (PCa). We genotyped a potentially functional polymorphism (rs779805) in 5′ UTR region of VHL in a case-control study of 665 PCa patients and 715 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population using the Taqman assay. The genetic associations between the incidence and progression of PCa were assessed by logistic regression. We observed that the rs779805 A>G polymorphism was significantly associated with risk for PCa. Compared with the AA genotype, the AG and AG/GG genotypes were associated with decreased risk of PCa (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.62-0.99, and adjusted OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.61-0.95, respectively). Further, this decreased risk was more pronounced in the subgroups of nonsmokers (OR=0.73, 95% CI=0.54-0.98), nondrinkers (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.54-0.91) and patients without family history of cancer (OR=0.72, 95% CI=0.57-0.92). In addition, the decreased risk associated with rs779805 variant genotypes (AG/GG) was more pronounced among the prostate specific antigen (PSA)>20 ng/mL subgroup (OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.49-0.95). Our findings suggest that the rs779805 A>G polymorphism in VHL may confer susceptibility to PCa in the Chinese population. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.

84862833322	Association of Chinese medicine constitution susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy and transforming growth factor-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphism	Objective: To explore the association of Chinese medicine constitution susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy (DN) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphism. Methods: TGF-β1 gene polymorphism detected with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) was screened for 180 DN cases and 180 type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) cases without combined DN. Patients with DN were surveyed epidemiologically with constitution in the Chinese medicine questionnaire (CCMQ). Binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to study the correlation between nine types of Chinese medicine constitution and TGF-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphisms. Results: The DN group has a higher frequency of TGF-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphism than the T2DM group, and CC/CT genotypes than the T2DM group [CC, CT, TT (DN group): 88, 87, 5 (cases) versus (T2DM group) 71, 73, 36 (cases), P<0.05]. The phlegm-dampness constitution, damp-heat constitution, and blood stasis constitution have correlations with TGF-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphism. Conclusion: Chinese medicine constitutions were associated with TGF-β1 (T869C) gene polymorphism, a potential predictor of susceptibility to DN in T2DM patients. © 2011 The Chinese Journal of Integrated Traditional and Western Medicine Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84863725816	Association between survivin 31GC promoter polymorphism and cancer risk: A meta-analysis	Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein and has a crucial role in the development of cancer. The survivin 31>GC (rs9904341) promoter polymorphism influences survivin expression and has been implicated in cancer risk. However, conflicting results have been published from studies on the association between survivin 31>GC polymorphism and the risk of cancer. To clarify the role of this polymorphism in cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of all available and relevant published studies, involving a total of 3485 cancer patients and 3964 control subjects. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of the associations. The overall results indicated that the variant genotypes were associated with a significantly increased cancer risk (CC vs GG: OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.20-2.10; CC/GC vs GG: OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.00-1.51; CC vs GG/GC: OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.23-1.85). In the stratified analyses, significantly increased risk was associated with the Asian populations (CC vs GG: OR=1.67, 95% CI=1.16-2.40; CC vs GG/GC: OR=1.50, 95% CI=1.17-1.91). We also performed the analyses by cancer type, and no statistical association was observed. The results suggest that the survivin 31GC promoter polymorphism might be associated with an increased risk of cancer, especially in the Asian populations. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84864021921	Genetic variations in a PTEN/AKT/mTOR axis and prostate cancer risk in a Chinese population	Backgroud: Genetic variations in a PTEN/AKT/mTOR signaling axis may influence cellular functions including cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis, and then increase the individual's risk of cancer. Accordingly, we explore the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of these genes and prostate cancer (PCa) in our Chinese population. Methods: Subjects were recruited from 666 PCa patients and 708 cancer-free controls, and eight SNPs in the PTEN/AKT/mTOR axis were determined by the TaqMan assay. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were evaluated by logistic regression. Results: We observed significant associations between PCa risk and mTOR rs2295080 [P = 0.027, OR = 0.85, 95%CI = 0.74-0.98], and AKT2 rs7254617 (P = 0.003, OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.11-1.64). When estimated these two SNPs together, the combined genotypes with 2-4 risk alleles (rs2295080 T and rs7254617 A alleles) were associated with an increased risk of PCa compared with 0-1 risk alleles, which was more pronounced among subgroups of age >71 years, smokers, drinkers and no family history of cancer. Results of stratified analyses by cliniopathological parameters revealed that the frequencies of the combined genotypes with 2-4 risk alleles in advanced stage were significantly higher than in localized stage(P = 0.022), but there was no significant association in Gleason score and PSA level. Conclusion: Our results indicate, for the first time that the two variants in AKT2 and mTOR, particularly the joint genotypes with 2-4 risk alleles may influence PCa susceptibility and progression in Chinese, and the association appeared to be more strong in the subgroup of smokers and drinkers. © 2012 Chen et al.

84864067451	Expression of PTTG1 and PTEN in endometrial carcinoma: Correlation with tumorigenesis and progression	Human pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 (PTTG1) is a newly identified proto-oncogene, and its overexpression occurs in a wide variety of human cancers. The tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) is frequently mutated or deleted in numerous tumors, especially in endometrial carcinoma. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the aberrant expression of PTTG1 and PTEN is associated with tumorigenesis and progression of endometrial carcinoma. Tissue microarray and immunohistochemical staining were undertaken in 124 endometrial carcinoma, 28 atypical hyperplasia and 35 normal endometrium samples. Then, the correlation of PTTG1 and PTEN expression with the clinicopathological features and with the levels of estrogen and progesterone receptor was analyzed. The presence of PTTG1 and PTEN protein was significantly increased and decreased, respectively, as lesions progressed from normal endometrium to atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma. PTTG1 protein showed a significantly positive correlation with TNM stage, but not with other characteristics. In addition, PTEN protein did not correlate with any parameters except for histological grade, to which it was found to be inversely related. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant relationship between an increase in PTTG1 and a decrease in PTEN. These results indicate that high expression of PTTG1 and low expression of PTEN may be involved in pathogenesis and development of endometrial carcinoma. The findings also provide evidence that combined evaluation of the two markers may be useful in predicting tumor behavior and thus prognosis. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

0038544629	Unique pattern of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis after liver transplantation	Objective: To explore the pathological features and the differential diagnosis of recurrent HBV after liver transplantation. Methods: One case of liver transplantation for HBV cirrhosis was subjected to liver biopsises on time postoperatively. Results: 25 days after liver transplantation, serologic HBsAg, HBeAg and HBV-DNA of the patient became negative, but HBsAg was positive again on day 58 after liver transplantation. Histopathological examination showed balloon-like changes of hepatocytes with fragmental necrosis, fibrosis in the portal areas and around the portal veins, cholestasis in some hepatocytes and canaliculi, and positive HBsAg and HBcAg with immunohistochemical staining. Clinically hepatic enzyme levels progressively increased, maintained for some time, and decreased rapidly at last. Stubborn hypoproteinemia was associated with the aggregation of general condition of the patient. Conclusions: Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH) is a special type in recurrent infection of HBV after liver transplantation. It has a serious clinical process and specific pathological changes different from those of the usual HBV.

84866740950	N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1/Cap43 may function as tumor suppressor in endometrial cancer	Purpose: N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) reportedly regulates tumor progression in various cancers. Our previous studies showed that NDRG1 was aberrantly overexpressed in human endometrial cancer tissues. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of NDRG1 in endometrial carcinogenesis. Methods: A short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated gene silencing strategy was employed to stably suppress the expression of NDRG1 in endometrial cancer Ishikawa cells. The influence of NDRG1 silencing on cancer cell biological behaviors was examined through observing in vitro tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration and invasion. Moreover, the mammalian NDRG1 expression vector pcDNA3.1(+)/NDRG1 was constructed to determine the effects of NDRG1 overex-pression on cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, gene expression microarray analysis was conducted to identify NDRG1 downstream target genes after NDRG1 knockdown. Results: It was demonstrated that NDRG1 knockdown significantly enhanced Ishikawa cell proliferation and dramatically promoted cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, overexpression of NDRG1 in Ishikawa cells greatly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Through microarray analysis and data mining, a large cohort of NDRG1-repressed target genes were identified. Additionally, through comparing the current microarray results with those obtained previously in studies of cervical and ovarian cancer cells conducted by us, 19 more specific common downstream target genes were identified. Conclusions: It was demonstrated that NDRG1 might carry out a tumor suppressor function during endometrial carcinogenesis. The identification of downstream target genes should afford meaningful hints for prospective investigations. The tumor suppressor function of NDRG1 may open a new window for the target therapy of endo-metrial cancer. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84869015040	Genetic polymorphisms in HIF1A are associated with prostate cancer risk in a Chinese population	The hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays an important role in regulating angiogenesis, which is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. Genetic variations of HIF1A (coding HIF-1α) have been shown to influence an individual's susceptibility to many human tumors; however, evidence on associations between HIF1A single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and prostate cancer (PCa) risk is conflicting. We genotyped three potentially functional polymorphisms in HIF1A (rs11549465, rs11549467 and rs2057482) using the TaqMan method and assessed their associations with PCa risk in a casecontrol study of 662PCa patients and 716 controls in a Chinese Han population. Compared with rs11549467 GG genotype, the variant genotypes GAAA had a significantly increased PCa risk (adjusted odds ratio (OR)1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI)1.062.72), particularly among older patients (OR2.01; 95%CI1.053.86), smokers (OR2.06; 95%CI1.073.99), never drinkers (OR2.16; 95%CI1.203.86) and patients without a family history of cancer (OR1.71; 95%CI1.022.89). Furthermore, patients with rs11549467 variant genotypes were associated with a higher Gleason score (OR2.14; 95%CI1.223.75). No altered PCa risk was associated with the rs11549465 and rs2057482 polymorphism. However, the combined variant genotypes of rs2057482 and rs11549467 were associated with increased PCa risk (OR2.10; 95%CI1.233.57 among subjects carrying three or more risk alleles). These results suggest that HIF1A polymorphisms may impact PCa susceptibility and progression in the Chinese Han population. © 2012 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.

84872144325	Propofol protects against high glucose-induced endothelial adhesion molecules expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Background: Hyperglycemia could induce oxidative stress, activate transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), up-regulate expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, and lead to endothelial injury. Studies have indicated that propofol could attenuate oxidative stress and suppress NF-κB activation in some situations. In the present study, we examined whether and how propofol improved high glucose-induced up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).Methods: Protein expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, NF-κB, inhibitory subunit of NF-κBα (IκBα), protein kinase Cβ2 (PKCβ2), and phosphorylation of PKCβ2 (Ser

84873728943	A functional polymorphism in the CYR61 (IGFBP10) gene is associated with prostate cancer risk	BACKGROUND:CYR61 (cysteine-rich protein 61, also named IGFBP10) is a secreted signaling molecule that promotes angiogenesis and tumor growth. The goal of this study is to determine whether a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the CYR61 gene (rs3753793) is associated with prostate cancer (PCa) risk and gene expression in Chinese patients.METHODS:A total of 665 patients diagnosed with PCa and 703 cancer-free controls were genotyped in this hospital-based case-control study, and 26 PCa tissue samples were evaluated for mRNA expression of CYR61 by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR.RESULTS:Men carrying the G allele of rs3753793 (TG+GG) had significantly lower risk of PCa when compared with the TT genotype (odds ratio (OR)=0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.61-0.95). The association was generally more pronounced among subgroups of PCa patients with advanced stage (OR=0.70, 95% CI=0.53-0.94), Gleason score >7 (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.46-0.86) and PSA>20 ng ml -1 (OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.53-0.88). Prostate tumors derived from cases with the GT/GG genotypes had significantly lower levels of CYR61 mRNA when compared with cases with the TT genotypes (P=0.02).CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that the genetic variation of rs3753793 in the CYR61 promoter may contribute to genetic predisposition to PCa and intra-tumor expression gene expression. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84874374345	Expression of IQGAP1 in mammary ductal carcinoma and its effect on cancer cell migration	Objective: To investigate the expression of IQ domain GTPase-activating protein (IQGAP1) in mammary ductal carcinoma, and explore the effect of IQGAP1 silencing on cancer cell migration. Methods: The expression of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma tissues, adjacent tissues of mammary ductal carcinoma and benign mammary lesion tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The relationship between expression of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma tissues and clinicopathological parameters was analysed. The lentivirus vector carrying shRNA-IQGAP1 was constructed, and the human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB- 435 cells with high metastasis potential were stably transfected. MDA-MB- 435 cells with stable silencing of the expression of IQGAP1 (IQGAP1-shRNA group), blank vector cells (Vector group) and blank control cells (Blank group) were obtained. The influence of IQGAP1 silencing on cancer cell migration was examined through in vitro cell migration test with Transwell system. Results: There were significant differences between the positive expression rate of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma tissues (83.44%, 136/163) and that in benign mammary lesion tissues (32.14%, 9/28) (P<0.01), while there was no significant difference between the positive expression rate of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma tissues and that in adjacent tissues of mammary ductal carcinoma (77.78%, 63/81)(P>0.05). In 163 cases of mammary ductal carcinoma, the numbers of cases with negative expression of IQGAP1 protein, positive expression of IQGAP1 protein in cytoplasm and positive expression of IQGAP1 protein in membrane were 1, 3 and 22 respectively in those with grade 3 mammary ductal carcinoma; the numbers of cases were 21, 40 and 61 respectively in those with grade 2 mammary ductal carcinoma; the numbers of cases were 5, 9 and 1 respectively in those with grade 1 mammary ductal carcinoma; and there were significant differences among them (P<0.01). The expression of IQGAP1 protein was related to the size of tumor (P<0.01), but was no related to the lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). The mean numbers of cells penetrating Transwell chamber in Blank group, Vector group and IQGAP1-shRNA group were 294.3±16.3, 287.7±16.9 and 93.5±7.6 respectively, and the number in IQGAP1-shRNA group was significantly lower than those in the other two groups (P<0.01). Conclusion: The expression of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma tissues is significantly higher than that in benign mammary lesion tissues, the location of IQGAP1 protein in mammary ductal carcinoma is associated with tumor differentiation, and IQGAP1 protein participates in tumor metastasis cascade.

84875783861	Aberrant expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, TWIST and E-cadherin is associated with aggressive tumor phenotypes in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma	Objective: Intratumoral hypoxia promotes angiogenesis, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a pivotal event in tumor metastasis. TWIST is a master regulator of multiple developmental processes and has recently been shown to be the key factor responsible for cancer metastasis via the inhibition of E-cadherin expression, a hallmark of epithelial- mesenchymal transition. This study aimed to determine the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, TWIST and E-cadherin in patients with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma and to examine their clinical significance in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma progression. Methods: Using immunohistochemical and tissue microarray approaches, we evaluated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, TWIST and E-cadherin in normal endometrial (n = 35), atypical hyperplasia (n = 28) and endometrioid endometrial carcinoma samples (n = 124). Furthermore, we statistically analyzed the association between these markers, as well as their correlation with clinicopathologic variables. Results: The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and TWIST were markedly increased, whereas E-cadherin was decreased, as lesions progressed from normal endometrium to atypical hyperplasia to carcinoma (P < 0.01). Among various clinical parameters, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α and TWIST was strikingly elevated with aggressive tumor characteristics, including higher pathologic grade, deep myometrial invasion and lymph node involvement (P < 0.05). More importantly, overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α positively correlated with enhanced TWIST expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma samples (r = 0.249, P < 0.01); however, statistical analysis showed a negative re-lationship between TWIST upregulation and E-cadherin downregulation (r = -0.183, P = 0.042). Conclusions: These results demonstrated for the first time that the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α/TWIST/E-cadherin pathway may play a critical role in invasion and metastasis of endome-trioid endometrial carcinoma. The combined evaluation of these markers may be useful in predicting aggressive phenotypes and thus prognosis in patients with endometrioid endo-metrial carcinoma. © The Author 2013.

84881159451	LOX-1 in atherosclerosis: Biological functions and pharmacological modifiers	Lectin-like oxidized LDL (oxLDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1, also known as OLR-1), is a class E scavenger receptor that mediates the uptake of oxLDL by vascular cells. LOX-1 is involved in endothelial dysfunction, monocyte adhesion, the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of smooth muscle cells, foam cell formation, platelet activation, as well as plaque instability; all of these events are critical in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These LOX-1-dependent biological processes contribute to plaque instability and the ultimate clinical sequelae of plaque rupture and life-threatening tissue ischemia. Administration of anti-LOX-1 antibodies inhibits atherosclerosis by decreasing these cellular events. Over the past decade, multiple drugs including naturally occurring antioxidants, statins, antiinflammatory agents, antihypertensive and antihyperglycemic drugs have been demonstrated to inhibit vascular LOX-1 expression and activity. Therefore, LOX-1 represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of human atherosclerotic diseases. This review aims to integrate the current understanding of LOX-1 signaling, regulation of LOX-1 by vasculoprotective drugs, and the importance of LOX-1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. © 2012 Springer Basel.

84883272351	Study on the relationship between chinese medicine constitutive susceptibility and diversity of syndrome in diabetic nephropathy	Objective: To explore the relationship between Chinese medicine (CM) constitutive susceptibility and syndrome diversity in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Methods: Epidemiologic investigation on constitution adopting the "Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire" (CCMQ), and survey on syndrome type by CM syndrome scale (preliminary) were carried out in 180 DN patients. Cluster analysis on symptom items was used to determine the syndrome type, and canonical correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between patients' constitution and syndrome. Results: Baseline levels in all enrolled patients were not different statistically. Cluster analysis showed 8 syndromes existed in DN patients, namely: I, qi-yin deficiency with qistagnancy type; II, yin-yang deficiency with heat-water-blood stasis type; III, qi-yin deficiency with dampnessheat type; IV, yin-yang deficiency with blood-stasis and heat type; V, qi-yin deficiency with stagnant heat type; VI, yin-yang deficiency with inner dampness-heat stagnancy type; VII, yin deficiency with heat stagnancy type; and VIII, Kidney (Shen)-Spleen (Pi) deficiency with stagnant heat type. Correlation analysis on the 8 syndromes and the 9 constitutions showed statistical significant correlations between syndrome III and dampness-heat constitution (P=0.0001); syndrome IV and blood-stasis constitution (P=0.0001); and syndrome VII and yin-deficiency constitution (P=0.0180). Conclusion: Certain relationship revealed between CM constitutions and syndrome types; constitution decides the disease genesis, its syndrome type and prognosis, as well as the change of syndromes. © 2013 Chinese Association of the Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84883551192	Functional promoter -31G/C variant of Survivin gene predict prostate cancer susceptibility among Chinese: A case control study	Background: Abnormal expression of Baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5, also called as survivin), a novel member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, has implications in many types of cancer and is considered as a new therapeutic target. We suppose that genetic variant rs9904341 in the 5′ UTR region of survivin gene may be associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) in Chinese population. Methods: TaqMan assay method was used to genotype the polymorphism in the hospital-based case-control analysis of 665 patients with PCa and 710 age-matched cancer-free controls. The genetic associations with the occurrence and progression of PCa were calculated by logistic regression. Results: Our results indicated that compared with GG genotypes, there was a statistically significant increased risk of PCa associated with those with CC genotypes [odds ratios (ORs) = 1.57, 95%confidence intervals (CIs) = 1.17-2.13, P = 0.004]. Moreover, stratification analysis revealed that the association was more pronounced in subgroups of nondrinkers, nonsmokers and those without a family history of cancer (all P < 0.05). In addition, we observed that PSA ≥ 20 was more frequent in patients carrying GC/CC genotypes than in those with a wild type genotype. Conclusion: The functional survivin rs9904341 genetic variant may have a substantial influence on the PCa susceptibility and evolution. © 2013 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0742306361	The expression of insulin-like growth factor- I mRNA and polypeptide in rat osteoblasts with exposure to parathyroid hormone	Objective. To investigate the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) gene and polypeptide expression in cultured rat osteoblast (ROB) and the role of IGF-I in mediating the cell-to-cell communication by mimicking the pharmacokinetics of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Methods. The ROB was cultured with three kinds of treatment: (1) Control (Ctr), the cells were cultured without PTH during the first 6 hours and the subsequent 42 hours in a 48-hour cycle; (2) Intermittent exposure to PTH (Itm), the cells were cultured with PTH during the first 6 hours, but without PTH in the subsequent 42 hours; and (3) Continuous exposure to PTH (Ctu), the cells were cultured with PTH during the first 6 hours and the subsequent 42 hours. Results. The bone-forming activities of ROB were increased in Itm and inhibited in Ctu. The IGF-I mRNA content in Itm cells was elevated only during the first 6 hours and that in Ctu cells was elevated at any time during an incubation cycle. The free IGF-I concentration in the medium of Itm cells was generally higher and that of the Ctu cells was generally lower compared with those of the Ctr cells. The IGF-I antibody significantly reduced the alkaline phosphatase activity within the cells of Ctr and Itm. Conclusions. PTH rapidly and constantly stimulates the IGF-I gene transcription of osteoblast. There was an obvious discrepancy between the IGF-I mRNA content within the osteoblast and the free IGF-I level around the osteoblast in either mode of PTH action. The IGF-I might be important for osteoblast-osteoblast communication and bone-forming activity, not only in intermittent PTH administration, but also in the physiological functioning of osteoblasts.

1342329748	Asymptomatic process of hepatic artery thrombosis in a patient after orthotopic liver transplantation	Background: Hepatic artery thrombosis is one of the serious complications after liver transplantation. It will mostly cause a failure of the transplantation. This case of hepatic artery thrombosis showed a stable clinical course and minimal histological change, And now has been surviving for 4 years with normal liver function. We investigated the possible causes for asymptomatic hepatic artery thrombosis in one patient after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) and discussed the diagnosis of ischemia of OLT pathologically and clinically. Methods: Liver function test, color Doppler ultrasonography, and hepatic arteriography were performed during the development of hepatic arteriothrombosis. Possible factors for the asymptomatic process of the thrombosis were analyzed. Results: On the 4th postoperative day, thrombosis formed at the anastomotic stoma of the hepatic artery, and on the 11th postoperative day, the artery was completely occluded. Serial liver biopsies revealed intrahepatic cholestasis, hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes, atrophy of the biliary epithelium, and fibrosis in the portal area. Monitoring of liver function showed nothing abnormal except elevation of γ-GT and ALP levels. On the 71st day after OLT, arteriography demonstrated that the hepatic artery remained completely occluded in addition to the establishment of collateral circulation and compensation of the portal vein. The patient didn't show any symptoms of arterial thrombosis. Conclusion: Collateral circulation and compensation of the portal vein are beneficial to allograft survival and avoidence of retransplantation after thrombosis of the hepatic artery. Color Doppler ultrasonography within 2 weeks after OLT is helpful to the early diagnosis of hepatic arteriothrombosis. © 2004, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.
