Confidence intervals can give an estimate of the range within which the true value of the statistic lies. And a narrow confidence interval indicates the low variability of the statistic, which can give a strong support for the conclusion made from the statistical analysis. In base station test, we can barely construct an accurate parameter model, because the measured value varies with many factors. Without theoretical formulas, we can not get accurate assessment of the measured value. The Efron bootstrap statistical analysis can just solve this problem. In this article, we introduce several nonparametric bootstrap methods in assessing the accuracy of sample statistic, and the validations of these methods are performed with both Measured data and simulation data.

84874341882	Learning to attack from electromagnetic emanation	Sensitive information processed by the circuitry in electronic security devices can be leaked via physical characteristics of the device, such as power consumption, electromagnetic (EM) emanation, timing, etc. These techniques are known as Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). To date, a significant amount of research has been carried out into side channel attacks, which uses statistical processing techniques to analyse the information leaked from the device. This work formalized the problem of studying the relation between EM emanation and encryption key as a supervised learning task. The considered technique is Support Vector Machine (SVM). The chosen side channel is the EM emanation and the target is a software implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES).

84886414333	A new method for identifying electromagnetic radiation sources using backpropagation neural network	Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely applied for their intelligence in pattern recognition and microwave components. For an electromagnetic (EM) radiated noise source involving EM compatibility issues, however, only Missouri-Rolla University utilized the ANN to identify EM radiated noise source types based on their different frequencies. In this study, a new method was proposed to identify EM radiated noise sources by using their spatial characteristics as unique parameters for the ANN, which is available even though radiated noise source frequencies overlap. A 3-D receiver array is used to collect the spatial characteristics of radiated noise sources. By training with 60 000 datasets, the network can identify the radiated noise source type within a few minutes with an accuracy as high as 99.98%. The influences on identification accuracy from different parameters, such as ambient noise, interval between neighboring receivers, distance between receiver array and radiated noise sources, moving steps of receiver array, training data number are discussed in detail. This method can be used in EM interference diagnostics and radio monitoring with high speed and accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.

84898686155	Research on performance improvement of source stirring reverberation chamber introduced by stationary diffusers	In order to improve the performance of source stirring reverberation chamber (SSRC), we studied the field uniformity of SSRC with stationary diffusers. First, we theoretically analyzed effects of stationary diffusers based on resonance and mode stirring theory, then, from actual measured results, we verified the validity of simulation results obtained by a simulation tool named FEldberechnung bei Korpern mit beliebiger Oberflache (FEKO). Finally, we calculated out the field uniformities of three different kinds of reverberation chamber (RC), i.e. mechanical stirring RC (MSRC), SSRC and SSRC with stationary diffusers. Results show that performance of SSRC is worse than that of MSRC except for a few frequencies, and three sets of stationary diffusers leading to SSRC achieve better uniformity which is close to that of MSRC. It is concluded that stationary diffusers can be used as a valid tool to improve the field uniformity of SSRC, and the combination of mechanical stirring and source stirring is possible to produce a composite stirring RC with better performance.

Because two dual-antenna systems can construct a quad-antenna system, the dual-antenna systems in the open literature are utilized. The mutual coupling between the two dual-antenna systems is analyzed and reduced. To validate the design of a quad-antenna system, the quad-antenna system, consisting of two dual-antenna systems proposed in the open literature and a decoupling element, is fabricated and tested.

84912564148	Channel model validation in MIMO-OTA chamber	Multi-probe anechoic chamber approach is the most prevalent test methodology for multi-antenna device receiving performance. To guarantee the validity of the measurement results, it is critical to perform channel model validation for the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channel environment emulated inside the multi-probe chamber. Typical spatial channel model covers four domains, namely temporal, frequency, spatial and polarization domains. We studied the validation measurement method of four corresponding key parameters in the four domains, i. e., power delay profile, Doppler spectrum, spatial correlation, and cross-polarization ratio. Based on the analysis, validation measurement was performed for spatial-channel-model-extended (SCME) urban micro channel model in a real multi-probe system with 8 probes. It shows that the differences between the measured and theoretical results are tiny on the four key parameters.
