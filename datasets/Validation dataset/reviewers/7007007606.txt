84929223422	A dual mode thermoelectric energy harvesting circuit using transformer-based boost converter, charge pump and time-domain digital control	Boost converter designed using miniaturized high turn-ratios transformer is an excellent circuit to achieve fully electrical autonomous start up at low input voltage. Nevertheless, at regulated output voltage, its power conversion loss at high input voltage is significant. A 2× cross-coupled charge pump is added to assist energy harvesting at high input voltage. The charge pump is turned on whenever the input voltage exceeds programmed threshold. Digital-only technique which guarantees minimal quiescent current is used to realize the shunt regulator implementation and power monitoring circuit, where the input voltage (power) is determined by measuring the transformer self-oscillation period. Time-based digital control eliminates the need of conventionally power hungry components i.e. amplifiers and voltage domain ADC. Simulation results using a standard CMOS 0.13-μm technology and thermoelectric generator equivalent circuit model validated the proposed architecture, which can generate output voltage levels at 1 V and 2 V, respectively. Additional voltage headroom provided by the charge pump is instrumental for sensor, analog and RF circuits. The system requires a minimum input voltage of 34 mV and input power of 110 μW to start up.

18444416788	Switching noise and shoot-through current reduction techniques for switched-capacitor voltage doubler	Switching noise and shoot-through current reduction techniques for switched-capacitor voltage doublers based on cross-coupled structure are presented. The intuitive analysis of the shoot-through current and switching noise generation processes in the doubler is first reported. Break-before-make mechanism is adopted to minimize the shoot-through current, thereby greatly reducing the no-load supply current dissipation and improving the light-load power efficiency of the voltage doubler. In addition, by employing gate-slope reduction technique at the serial power transistor during turn-on, the switching noise of the voltage doubler is significantly lowered. Two voltage doublers with and without the proposed circuit techniques have been fabricated in a 0.6-μm CMOS process. Experimental results verify that the total supply current at no-load condition of the proposed voltage doubler is reduced by twofold and its switching noise is decreased by 2.5 times. © 2005 IEEE.

2542451919	Process-independent analogue data driver for polysilicon TFT AMLCD	Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin film transistor (TFT) technology is very suitable for driving an active matrix LCD (AMLCD) panel as the driver circuit, and the panel can be integrated on the same substrate. This allows the entire display system to be thin and makes the concepts of 'TV on wall' and 'sheet computer' possible. However, the large variation of threshold voltage of poly-Si TFT across the wafer makes it difficult to obtain analogue amplifiers with constant gain and phase margin. In this paper, an analogue data driver for the poly-Si TFT AMLCD is proposed. An operational amplifier with a gate bias-voltage generation circuit for this analogue data driver, with characteristics independent of variations in threshold voltage, will be presented. In Hspice simulation, with threshold voltage varying from 2.5V to 4.5V, gain variations of the proposed amplifier were reduced from ±10 dB to ±0.2 dB and phase margin variations were reduced from 10°to 0.37° compared with typical operational amplifier design. This enables the analogue data driver for AMLCD to be implemented in poly-Si TFT technology.

By developing a systematic way to design both the response time and optimal sizing of driving transistors in the SRE circuit, the SRE circuit can be controlled to turn on or turn off properly. In addition, the analog driver only dissipates low static power and its transient responses are significantly improved without transient overshoot when driving large capacitive loads. Implemented in a 0.6-μm CMOS process, a current-mirror amplifier with the current-detection SRE circuit has achieved over 43 times improvement in both slew rate and 1% settling time when driving a 470-pF load capacitor. When the proposed analog driver is employed in a 50-mA CMOS low-dropout regulator (LDO), the resultant load transient response of the LDO has 2-fold improvement for the maximum load-current change, while the total quiescent current is only increased by less than 3%. © 2005 IEEE.

0033169517	A new lateral trench-gate conductivity modulated power transistor	-In this paper, a new conductivity modulated power transistor called the Lateral Trench-Gate Bipolar Transistor (LTGBT) is presented. This structure incorporates a trench-gate in which the locations of the channel and source in conventional LIGBT have been interchanged. This channel and source ar- rangement results in significant improvement in latch-up current density. Experimental results indicate that the static and dynamic latch-up current densities are improved by 2.3 and 4.2 times, respectively, compared to those of the LIGBT at a n+ cathode length of 5 fim. Dependence of the latch-up current density of the LTGBT on the design of the n+ and p+ cathode regions is examined both numerically and experimentally. The maximum controllable current density is found to be increased when the space between the trench-gate and the p+ cathode is reduced. Specifically, as the space is decreased to 2 /im, no latch-up phenomenon was observed. This nonlatch-up characteristic is obtained at the expense of a slight increase (0.8 V) in threshold voltage. © 1999 IEEE.

0033892819	Ultra-thin elevated channel poly-Si TFT technology for fully-integrated AMLCD system on glass	A novel low temperature poly-Si (LTPS) TFT technology called the ultra-thin elevated channel TFT (UT-ECTFT) technology is proposed. The devices fabricated using this technology have an ultra-thin channel region (300 angstroms) and a thick drain/source region (3000 angstroms). The ultra-thin channel region is connected to the heavily doped thick drain/source region through a lightly doped overlapped region. The ultra-thin channel region is used to obtain a low grain-boundary trap density in the channel, and the overlapped lightly doped region provides an effective way for electric field spreading at the drain, thereby reduces the electric field there significantly. With the low grain-boundary trap density and low drain electric field, excellent current saturation characteristics and high drain breakdown voltage are obtained in the UT-ECTFT. Moreover, this technology provides complementary LTPS TFT's with more than two times increase in on-current, 3.5 times reduction in off-current compared to conventional thick channel LTPS TFT's.

34249821961	An SC voltage doubler with pseudo-continuous output regulation using a three-stage switchable opamp	This paper presents a switched-capacitor voltage doubler using pseudo-continuous control (PCC). The proposed PCC does not require extra power transistor to continuously regulate the output of the doubler, thereby saving chip area. The PCC also allows the doubler to operate at lower switching frequencies without sacrificing transient response. The light-load efficiency of the regulated doubler can thus be enhanced by reducing the switching power loss. In addition, a three-stage switchable opamp with time-multiplexed enhanced active-feedback frequency compensation is developed to implement the controller. The proposed implementation enhances the speed of the loop response and then improves the load transient response of the regulated doubler. The SC voltage doubler with the proposed PCC controller has been fabricated in a 0.6-μin CMOS process. The regulated doubler achieves >87% power efficiency even for the load current of 5 mA. By operating the doubler at switching frequency of 200 kHz and using a output capacitor of 2.2 μF, a maximum output ripple of 20 mV is maintained for the load current changing from 50 mA to 150 mA. The output transient recovery time of the regulated doubler is ∼25 μs with load-current step changes of 100 mA/1 μs. © 2007 IEEE.

84866604188	On-chip digital inductor current sensor for monolithic digitally controlled DC-DC Converters	Inductor current information can be used by digitally controlled DC-DC converters as control signal or over-current protection. In most of the existing approaches, the digital inductor current-sensing and quantization are always designed and implemented as two separated functional blocks, e.g. an analog current sensor and an ADC. This is actually a redundant approach and designing a high-gain amplifier in deep sub-micron process is power consuming. Therefore, this paper proposed an on-chip digital inductor current sensor which combines both the sensing and quantization into a single functional block. In this way, chip area and power consumption can be saved. An 8-bit digital inductor current sensor for 4MHz buck converter is designed and implemented.

A few research works have investigated other ways of obtaining the inductor current information in the digital domain. This paper proposes an on-chip digital inductor current sensor that combines both the inductor current-sensing and quantization into a single functional block. In this way, the redundancies found in the conventional approach can be reduced and optimizations can be made to save chip area and power consumption. An 8-bit digital inductor current sensor has been designed and fabricated with a UMC 0.13μ m CMOS process.

They are even more beneficial to nowadays high-frequency fully integrated converters with output capacitor integrated on-chip. As one of the dominant chip area consumers, reducing the size of the on-chip decoupling capacitors directly leads to cost down. It is reported that a 5× capacitor area reduction can be achieved with a four-phase converter compared to a single-phase one [1]. However, the penalty is obvious.

84907888776	Through silicon underfill dispensing for 3D die/interposer stacking	This study describes a through-silicon-underfill dispensing that the encapsulant is dispensed through through-silicon-vias (TSVs). The TSVs function as entrances for encapsulant dispensing or paths for fluid flow. Typically, the inflow for TSV dispensing may be flow with a constant speed or free droplets. A model was developed to investigate the filling time and the pressure distribution for the quasi-steady, radial and laminar flow between parallel plates. Compared with free droplets, a constant inflow has shorter filling time at the expense of increasing the fluid pressure. 3D stacking with the same-size interposers forms several planar sidewalls. Encapsulant may flow out from the edges of the sidewalls and form an edge flood failure if the edge flow of an underfill can overcome the surface force. An optimized pattern of TSVs was designed for the underfill of a 3D package to identify the trade-off between the filling efficiency and the lower risk of the edge flood. In each interposer, the TSVs are classified into two groups: the central group is dispensed by a constant inflow whereas the outer group is dispensed by free droplets; the inflow of free droplets eliminates the risk of an edge flood. A four-stack 3D package with the optimized TSV pattern was developed for validation. Edge dispensing was used to fill the gaps at the bottom levels as much as possible. Subsequently, the remaining gaps were encapsulated by TSV dispensing (with both a constant inflow and an inflow of free droplets). Inspections by scanning acoustic microscopy and cross-sectioning verified that the combined underfill could result in a void-free encapsulation and suitable fillets.

Nevertheless, conventional transformer-based boost converters commonly used to achieve autonomous low voltage startup encounter low efficiency and potential startup problems with these novel power sources due to their high internal resistance. In this paper, an improved design of transformer-based boost converter addressing these issues is demonstrated with prototype chip fabricated using a standard 0.13 μm CMOS process. The self-start oscillation does not rely on the conventional LC resonant principle, but instead is dependent on the MOS transistor's active-over-leakage current ratio and the mutual coupling between the two identical transformer coils. Circuit design techniques to regulate output voltage and to track system's maximum power point (MPP) of this boost converter are presented. Measurement results confirmed that the proposed circuit works with either low threshold voltage or native MOS transistors.

A novel low-voltage pulse-width modulator is proposed. The modulator can be directly powered from the 0.9-V input instead of using the 2.5-V output as in general modulator designs. Sophisticated low-voltage analog blocks, which normally consume a large amount of power and chip area, are not required in the modulator. The impact of output-voltage ripple and transient-induced output-voltage perturbation on the operation of analog blocks inside the modulator is eliminated. Boost converter start-up sequence is also greatly simplified. A CMOS-control rectifier (CCR) is also proposed to improve converter power efficiency. The CCR is used to replace the conventional rectifying switch to provide adaptive dead-time, which helps to minimize charge-sharing loss and body-diode conduction loss. Corresponding thermal stress on the rectifying switch is hence minimized. The CCR also enables the use of small off-chip inductor and capacitor at sub-MHz switching frequency to improve light-load efficiency. This converter has been implemented in a 0.35-/Km CMOS process. It is designed to operate at ∼667 kHz with a 1 μH inductor and 4.7 μF output capacitor to reduce both switching loss and form factor.

The open-loop DC gain is boosted up by a low frequency dominant pole, which increases the regulator accuracy. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme, a LDR utilizing the new frequency compensation scheme is designed and fabricated using TSMC 0.35μm digital CMOS process. Simulation results show that with output current from 0 μA to 100 mA the bandwidth variation is only 2.3 times and the minimum DC gain is 72 dB. Measurement of the dynamic response matches well with simulation.

79960984135	Design and implementation of fully integrated digitally controlled current-mode buck converter	Digital current-mode control is a dual-loop control which potentially results in a better transient response and thus is more favorable than voltage-mode control. There are only a few publications on how to design and implement a fully integrated digital controller as the on-chip implementation is very challenging, especially for current-mode control. This paper addresses those design challenges and considerations. One of the main challenges is to efficiently sample and quantize both the output voltage and inductor current of the buck converter for control purposes. A time-multiplex scheme is used for the control-loop which enables the converter to work with a single ADC. A modified delay-lock-loop DPWM has been developed for minimizing the mismatch of the delay-cells. This enhances the accuracy at high frequency to prevent limit-cycle. A new algorithm has also been proposed for implementing look-up-table digital compensators with 20% less chip area. A converter with the fully integrated digitally controlled loop, including the single ADC, digital compensators and DPWM, has been fabricated in a CMOS 0.35 μm process with a chip area of 1049 μm × 1533 μm. Measurement results show that the buck converter has a load transient response of 20 μs, which is one of the fastest compared to other state-of-the-art digitally controlled buck converter. © 2011 IEEE.

This control can handle large loads or unbalanced loads with minimized cross interference between channels. A constant-charge-auto-hopping CCAH control is also presented to further extend the power handling capacity of the regulator with a predictable system switching noise spectrum. The switching frequency of the converter can be automatically hopped between 1 MHz and 1 MHz/N where N= to 7 according to the total loads and during load transient. To minimize cross-regulation during frequency hopping, the inductor peak current is set to a predefined value according to the switching frequency information from the frequency detection unit to deliver a constant charge per switching period to the unchanged outputs. The response of the transient output is also enhanced with this inductor peak current prediction method. A prototype has been fabricated with a 0.35 mμ CMOS process to verify the effectiveness of the CCAH control. With 1.8 V-2.4 V input voltage, two regulated output voltages between 3.0 V and 3.6 V, with maximum 400 mA to 600 mA driving capability and maximum power efficiency of 91.6% is achieved at total output power of 1.15 W. Load transient measurements show that the worst-case cross-regulation is 0.033 mV/mA with a 300 mA load current change at output A and 0.0714 mV/mA with a 280 mA load current change at output B.

0037344378	Active-feedback frequency-compensation technique for low-power multistage amplifiers	An active-feedback frequency-compensation (AFFC) technique for low-power operational amplifiers is presented in this paper. With an active-feedback mechanism, a high-speed block separates the low-frequency high-gain path and high-frequency signal path such that high gain and wide bandwidth can be achieved simultaneously in the AFFC amplifier. The gain stage in the active-feedback network also reduces the size of the compensation capacitors such that the overall chip area of the amplifier becomes smaller and the slew rate is improved. Furthermore, the presence of a left-half-plane zero in the proposed AFFC topology improves the stability and settling behavior of the amplifier. Three-stage amplifiers based on AFFC and nested-Miller compensation (NMC) techniques have been implemented by a commercial 0.8-μm CMOS process. When driving a 120-pF capacitive load, the AFFC amplifier achieves over 100-dB dc gain, 4.5-MHz gain-bandwidth product (GBW), 65° phase margin, and 1.5-V/μs average slew rate, while only dissipating 400-μW power at a 2-V supply. Compared to a three-stage NMC amplifier, the proposed AFFC amplifier provides improvement in both the GBW and slew rate by 11 times and reduces the chip area by 2.3 times without significant increase in the power consumption.

Since the amount of energy that can be harvested from the surrounding environment is limited, the available output voltage of a harvester is low. Therefore, the design of a low-input-voltage (low-V<inf>IN</inf>) up-converter is critical to self-powered systems [1-3]. Moreover, the form factor is very constrained in applications such as wearable electronic devices and sensor networks. Recently, low-V <inf>IN</inf> charge pumps (CPs) for energy harvesting has been compared with DC-DC converters using a large inductor [1-3]. CPs introduced in [1] and [2] use the advanced process technology to push V<inf>IN</inf> down to the subthreshold region.
