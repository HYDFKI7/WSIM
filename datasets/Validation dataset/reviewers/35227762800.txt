We determine the mass to be M<inf>X(3872)</inf>=(3871.85±0.27(stat)±0.19(syst))MeV, a 90% confidence level upper limit on the natural width of Γ <inf>X(3872)</inf><1.2MeV, the product branching fraction B(B <sup>+</sup>→K<sup>+</sup>X(3872))×B(X(3872)→π <sup>+</sup>π<sup>-</sup>J/ψ)=(8.63±0.82(stat)±0.52(syst)) ×10<sup>-</sup>6, and a ratio of branching fractions B(B0→K0X(3872))/ B(B<sup>+</sup>→K<sup>+</sup>X(3872))=0.50±0.14(stat)±0. 04(syst).

A search for a charged partner of the X(3872) in the decays B <sup>̄</sup>0→K<sup>-</sup>X<sup>+</sup> or B<sup>+</sup>→ K0X<sup>+</sup>, X<sup>+</sup>→π<sup>+</sup>π0J/ψ resulted in upper limits on the product branching fractions for these processes that are well below expectations for the case that the X(3872) is the neutral member of an isospin triplet. In addition, we examine possible JPC quantum number assignments for the X(3872) based on comparisons of angular correlations between final state particles in X(3872)→π<sup>+</sup>π<sup>-</sup>J/ψ decays with simulated data for JPC values of 1<sup>++</sup> and 2 <sup>-+</sup>.

We observe the decay B+→ηπ+ and find evidence of B+→ηK+; the measured branching fractions are B(B+→ηπ+)=(4.8-0.7+0.8(stat)±0.3(sys))×10-6 and B(B+→ηK+)=(2.1±0.6(stat)±0.2(sys))×10-6.

33645799703	Improved constraints on D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- Decays from the Belle detector	We report the results of a search for D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- decays based on 400fb-1 of data accumulated by the Belle detector at KEKB. Both assuming CP conservation and allowing for CP violation, we fit the decay-time distribution for the mixing parameters x′ and y′, as well as for the parameter RD, the ratio of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays to Cabibbo-favored decays. The 95% confidence level region in the (x′2,y′) plane is obtained using a frequentist method. Assuming CP conservation, we find x′2<0.72×10-3 and -9.9×10-3<y′<6.8×10-3 at the 95% confidence level; these are the most stringent constraints on the mixing parameters to date. The no-mixing point (0,0) has a confidence level of 3.9%. Assuming no mixing, we measure RD=(0.377±0.008±0.005)%. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Using fully reconstructed D(*)π events and partially reconstructed D*π events from a data sample that contains 386×106 BB̄ pairs that was collected near the Υ(4S) resonance, with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider, we obtain the CP violation parameters S+(D(*)π) and S-(D(*)π). We obtain S+(D*π)=0.049±0.020(stat)±0.011(sys), S-(D*π)=0.031±0.019(stat)±0.011(sys), and S+(Dπ)=0.031±0.030(stat)±0.012(sys), S-(Dπ)=0.068±0. 029(stat)±0.012(sys). These results are an indication of CP violation in B0→D*-π+ and B0→D-π+ decays at the 2.5σ and 2.2σ levels, respectively. If we use the values of RD(*)π that are derived using assumptions of factorization and SU(3) symmetry, branching fraction measurements for the B→Ds(*)π modes, and lattice QCD calculations, we can restrict the allowed region of |sin (2 1+ 3)| to be above 0.44 and 0.52 at 68% confidence level from the D*π and Dπ modes, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The method exploits the interference between D0 and D̄0 to extract the angle 3, strong phase δ and the ratio r of suppressed and allowed amplitudes. We apply this method to a 357fb-1 data sample collected by the Belle experiment. The analysis uses three modes: B+→DK+, B+→D*K+ with D*→Dπ0, and B+→DK*+ with K*+→KS0π+, as well as the corresponding charge-conjugate modes. From a combined maximum likelihood fit to the three modes, we obtain 3=53°+15°-18°(stat)±3°(syst) ±9°(model).

34547287233	Evidence for D0-D̄0 mixing	We observe evidence for D0-D̄0 mixing by measuring the difference in the apparent lifetime when a D0 meson decays to the CP eigenstates K+K- and π+π- and when it decays to the final state K-π+. We find the relative difference of the lifetimes yCP to be [1.31±0.32(stat)±0.25(syst)] %, 3.2 standard deviations from zero. We also search for a CP asymmetry between D0 and D̄0 decays; no evidence for CP violation is found.

34547292556	Experimental constraints on the spin and parity of the Λc(2880)+	We report the results of several studies of the Λc+π+π-X final state in continuum e+e- annihilation data collected by the Belle detector. An analysis of angular distributions in Λc(2880)+→Σc(2455)0, ++π+,- decays strongly favors a Λc(2880)+ spin assignment of 52 over 32 or 12. We find evidence for Λc(2880)+→Σc(2520)0,++π+,- decay and measure the ratio of Λc(2880)+ partial widths Γ(Σc(2520)π)/Γ(Σc(2455)π)=0.225±0. 062±0.025. This value favors the Λc(2880)+ spin-parity assignment of 52+ over 52-.

34547296570	Evidence for CP violation in B0→D+D- Decays	We report measurements of the branching fraction and CP violation parameters in B0→D+D- decays. The results are based on a data sample that contains 535×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance, with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We obtain [1.97±0.20(stat)±0.20(syst)]×10-4 for the branching fraction of B0→D+D-. The measured values of the CP violation parameters are S=-1.13±0.37±0.09, A=0.91±0.23±0.06, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. We find evidence of CP violation in B0→D+D- at the 4.1σ confidence level. While the value of S is consistent with expectations from other measurements, the value of the parameter A favors large direct CP violation at the 3.2σ confidence level, in contradiction to standard model expectations. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The data was collected on the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric energy e+e- collider.

35348856980	Measurement of branching fraction and time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters in B0→D*+D*-KS0 decays	We present a measurement of the branching fraction and time-dependent CP violation parameters for B0→D*+D*-KS0 decays. These results are obtained from a 414fb-1 data sample that contains 449×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We obtain the branching fraction, B(B0→D*+D*-KS0)=[3.4±0.4(stat)±0.7(syst)] ×10-3, which is in agreement with the current world average. We also obtain an upper limit on the product branching fraction for a possible two-body decay, B(B0→Ds1+(2536)D*-)B(Ds1+(2536)→D*+KS0)<7. 1×10-4 (90% CL). In the traditional 2-parameter time-dependent CP analysis, we measure the CP violation parameters, ACP=-0.01-0.28+0.28(stat) ±0.09(syst), Dsin 2 1=0.06-0.44+0.45(stat)±0.06(syst). No evidence for either mixing-induced or direct CP violation is found. In a 3-parameter fit sensitive to cos 2 1 performed in the half-Dalitz spaces, s-≤s+ and s->s+, where s± m2(D*±KS0), we extract the CP violation parameters, Jc/J0=0.60-0.28+0.25(stat)±0.08(syst), 2Js1/J0sin 2 1=-0.17-0.42+0.42(stat)±0.09(syst), 2Js2/J0cos 2 1=-0.23-0.41+0.43(stat) ±0.13(syst). A large value of Jc/J0 would indicate a significant resonant contribution from a broad unknown Ds**+ state. Although the sign of the factor, 2Js2/J0, can be deduced from theory, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the sign of cos 2 1 given the errors. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We consider fragmentation into the main charmed hadron ground states, namely D0,D+,Ds+ and Λc+, as well as the excited states D*0 and D*+. The fragmentation functions are important to measure as they describe processes at a low energy scale, where calculations in perturbation theory lead to large uncertainties. Fragmentation functions can also be used as input distributions for Monte Carlo generators. Additionally, we determine the average number of these charmed hadrons produced per B decay at the Υ(4S) resonance and measure the distribution of their production angle in e+e- annihilation events and in B decays. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Events are tagged by fully reconstructing one of the B mesons, produced in pairs from Υ(4S).

The result is significantly below a naive extrapolation from B(B-→Ξc0Λ̄c-) assuming a simple Cabibbo-suppression factor of |Vcd/Vcs|2.

Differential cross sections are fitted to obtain information on S, D0, D2, G0, and G2 waves. The G waves are important above W1.6GeV. The general behavior of partial waves is studied by fitting differential cross sections in a simple parametrization where amplitudes contain resonant contributions and smooth background. The D2 wave is dominated by the f2(1270) meson whose parameters are consistent with the current world averages. The D0 wave contains a f2(1270) component, whose fraction is fitted. For the S wave, the f0(980) parameters are found to be consistent with the values determined from our recent π+π- data. In addition to the f0(980), the S wave prefers to have another resonance-like contribution whose parameters are obtained. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We do not find significant evidence for the mode B-→DK-, D→K+π-, and set an upper limit of rB<0.19, where rB is the magnitude of the ratio of amplitudes |A(B-→D̄0K-)/A(B-→D0K-)|. The decay B-→Dπ-, D→K+π- is also analyzed as a reference, for which we observe a signal with 6.6σ significance, and measure the charge asymmetry ADπ to be -0.02-0.16+0.15(stat)±0.04(syst).

These results are obtained from a data sample containing 657×106 BB̄ pairs collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We set an upper limit on B(B0→ρ0ρ0) of 1.0×10-6 at the 90% confidence level (C.L.). From our B0→ρ0ρ0 measurement and an isospin analysis, we determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase 2 to be 91.7±14.9 degrees. We find excesses in B0→ρ0π+π- and nonresonant B0→4π± with 1.3σ and 2.5σ significance, respectively. The corresponding branching fractions are less than 12.0×10-6 and 19.3×10-6 at the 90% C.L. In addition, we set 90% C.L. upper limits as follows: B(B0→ρ0f0(980))<0.3×10-6, B(B0→f0(980)f0(980))<0.1×10-6, and B(B0→f0(980)π+π-) <3.8×10-6. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The method employs the interference between D<sup>0</sup> and D̄<sup>0</sup> to extract both the weak and strong phases.

We observe B0→ΛΛ̄K0 and B0→ΛΛ̄K*0 with branching fractions of (4.76-0.68+0.84(stat)±0.61(syst))×10-6 and (2.46-0.72+0. 87±0.34)×10-6, respectively. The significances of these signals in the threshold-mass enhanced mass region, MΛΛ̄<2.85GeV/c2, are 12.4σ and 9.3σ, respectively. We also update the branching fraction B(B+→ΛΛ̄K+)=(3.38-0.36+0.41±0.41) ×10-6 with better accuracy, and report the following measurement or 90% confidence level upper limit in the threshold-mass-enhanced region: B(B+→ΛΛ̄K*+)=(2.19-0.88+1.13±0.33) ×10-6 with 3.7σ significance; B(B+→ΛΛ̄π+) <0.94×10-6. A related search for B0→ΛΛ̄D̄0 yields a branching fraction B(B0→ΛΛ̄D̄0)=(1.05-0. 44+0.57±0.14)×10-5. This may be compared with the large, ∼10-4, branching fraction observed for B0→pp̄D̄0.

64849109412	High-statistics study of neutral-pion pair production in two-photon collisions	The differential cross sections for the process γγ→π 0π0 have been measured in the kinematic range 0.6GeV<W<4.1GeV, |cos θ*|<0.8 in energy and pion scattering angle, respectively, in the γγ center-of-mass system. The results are based on a 223fb-1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. The differential cross sections are fitted in the energy region 1.7GeV<W<2. 5GeV to confirm the two-photon production of two pions in the G wave. In the higher-energy region, we observe production of the χc0 charmonium state and obtain the product of its two-photon decay width and branching fraction to π0π0. We also compare the observed angular dependence and ratios of cross sections for neutral-pion and charged-pion pair production to QCD models. The energy and angular dependence above 3.1 GeV are compatible with those measured in the π+π- channel, and in addition we find that the cross section ratio, σ(π0π0)/σ(π+π-), is 0.32±0.03±0.05 on average in the 3.1-4.1 GeV region. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

In the former case the J/ψ and a charmed hadron are reconstructed, while the latter process is measured using the recoil mass technique, which allows the identification of two-body final states without reconstruction of one of the charmonia. The measured e+e-→J/ψcc̄ cross section is (0.74±0.08+0.09-0.08)pb, and the e+e-→J/ψXnon- cc̄ cross section is (0.43±0.09±0.09)pb. We note that the measured cross sections are obtained from a data sample with the multiplicity of charged tracks in the event larger than 4; corrections for the effect of this requirement are not performed as this cannot be done in a model-independent way. The analysis is based on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 673fb-1 recorded near the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- asymmetric-energy collider. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

These results are obtained from a large data sample that contains 657×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. For the CP violation parameters, we obtain two consistent solutions that describe the data well. The first of these solutions may be preferred by external information from other measurements. There is no evidence for direct CP violation in B0→ρ0(770)KS0, B0→f0(980)KS0 and B0→K*+(892)π-, while measurements of mixing-induced CP violation in B0→ρ0(770)KS0 and B0→f0(980)KS0 decays are consistent with that of b→cc̄s decays.

The results are based on a 223fb-1 data sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. Clear peaks due to the a0(980) and a2(1320) are visible. The differential cross sections are fitted in the energy region 0.9GeV<W<1.46GeV to obtain the parameters of the a0(980). Its mass, width and ΓγγB(ηπ0) are measured to be 982.3-0.7-4.7+0.6+3. 1MeV/c2, 75.6±1.6-10.0+17.4MeV and 128-2-43+3+502eV, respectively. The energy and angular dependences above 3.1 GeV are compared with those measured in the π0π0 channel. The integrated cross section over θ*|<0. 8 has a W-n dependence with n=10.5±1.2±0.5, which is slightly larger than that for π0π0. The differential cross sections show a sin-4θ* dependence similar to γγ→π0π0. The measured cross section ratio, σ(ηπ0)/σ(π0π0)=0. 48±0.05±0.04, is consistent with a QCD-based prediction. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

0542440981	Jet pseudorapidity distribution in direct photon events in pp̄ collisions at √s=1.8 TeV	We present the first measurement of the jet pseudorapidity distribution in direct photon events from a sample of pp̄ collisions at √s= 1.8 TeV, recorded with the Collider Detector at Fermilab. Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that these events are primarily from hard quark-gluon Compton scattering, qg→qγ, with the final state quark producing the jet of hadrons. The jet pseudorapidity distribution in this model is sensitive to parton momentum fractions between 0.015 and 0.15. We find that the shape of the measured pseudorapidity distribution agrees well with next-to-leading order QCD calculations.

84924411993	Measurement of branching fractions for B → J/ψηK decays and search for a narrow resonance in the J/ψη final state	We report an observation of the B<sup>±</sup>→ J/ψηK<sup>±</sup> and B<sup>0</sup> → J/ψηK<sup>0</sup>S decays using 772 × 10<sup>6</sup>BB¯ pairs collected at the γ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> collider. We obtain the branching fractions B(B?→ J/ψηK<sup>±</sup>) = (1.27 ±0.11(stat.) ±0.11(syst.)) ×10<sup>-4</sup> and B(B<sup>0</sup> → J/ψηK<sup>0</sup> S ) = (5.22 ±0.78(stat.) ± 0.49(syst.)) ×10<sup>-5</sup>. We search for a new narrow charmonium(-like) state X in the J/ψη mass spectrum and find no significant excess. We set upper limits on the product of branching fractions, B(B±→ X K± )B(X → J/ψη), at 3872MeVc<sup>-2</sup> where aC-odd partner of X(3872) may exist, at ψ(4040) and ψ(4160) assuming their known mass and width, and over a range from 3.8 to 4.8 GeV c<sup>-2</sup>. The obtained upper limits at 90% confidence level for X<sup>C-odd</sup>(3872), ψ(4040), and ψ(4160) are 3.8 ×10<sup>-6</sup>, 15.5 ×10<sup>-6</sup>, and 7.4 ×10<sup>-6</sup>, respectively.
