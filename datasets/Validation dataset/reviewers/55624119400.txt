9244242523	Methylation profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes that may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis	Aim: To establish the methylation profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes that might play etiological roles in colon carcinogenesis. Methods: The methylation specific PCR in conjunction of sequencing verification was used to establish the methylation-profile of the promoter CpG islands of 31 genes in colorectal cancer (n = 65), the neighboring non-cancerous tissues (n = 5), colorectal adenoma (n = 8), and normal mucosa (n = 1). Immunohistochemically, expression of 10 genes was assessed on the home-made tissue microarrays of tissues from 58 patients. The correlation of tumor specific changes with each of clinical-pathologic features was scrutinized with relevant statistic tools. Results: In comparison with the normal mucosa of the non-cancer patients, the following 14 genes displayed no tumor associated changes: breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (epithelial) (CDH1), death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), melanoma antigen, family A, 1 (directs expression of antigen MZ2-E) (MAGEA1), tumor suppressor candidate 3 (N33), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1) (p21

20344388558	X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging of uterine leiomyomas	Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the microstructures of a uterine leiomyoma using a synchrotron-based imaging technique. Material/Methods: The tissues of different regions of a uterine leiomyoma were imaged using X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging. Results: Compared with optical microscopy and conventional X-ray, X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging can show not only the surface, but also the internal structure of organs or soft tissues with better contrast. Internal hyaline degeneration and the cavum of liquefied uterine leiomyomas are shown very clearly. Some microstructures, such as the myomatous burble, rupture and conglomeration of muscle fiber, and the cavum resulting from red degeneration, can be displayed in X-ray diffraction-enhanced images. These microstructures can show the developmental progress of necrosis in uterine leiomyomas and indicate their potential canceration. Conclusions: X-ray diffraction-enhanced imaging can clearly show internal microstructures of uterine leiomyomas, making the complex procedure of doing this with a large number of pathology slices avoidable. © Med Sci Monit, 2005.

19944431185	To design and actualize the information coding solution to the clinical pathological diagnosis classification system	Purpose: To design a standardization system to define diseases precisely. Methods: Multiple classifying contents are employed to define diseases or morphological changes. SQL SERVER 2000 database is applied to design database. Results: The coding solution to the clinical pathological diagnosis classification is established on a 9-digit core code plus a 2-digit add-on code system. The core code stands for the classification code of the disease's nature which includes "property classification", "biological behavior", "histological origin", "morphological classification" and "diagnostic nomenclature number". The add-on code consists of "sample source" and "pathological sort". Conclusions: Pathological diagnosis code database can be corresponding to the SNOMED-International (Systematized Nomenclature of Human and Veterinary Medicine) and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code. It will facilitate the communication of medical information among internation peers and exert positive influences on the popularization of standard code of hospital information system and the standardization of pathological diagnosis.

20244388995	Clinicopathological and molecular genetic analysis of HNPCC in China	Aim: To explore the clinicopathological and molecular genetic features of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) in Chinese population. Methods: We collected 16 Chinese HNPCC families from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Tumor tissues and peripheral white blood cells were studied using microdissection, microsatellite analysis, immunostaining of hMSH2 and hMLH1 proteins and direct DNA sequencing of hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes. Results: (1) A total of 50 patients had CRC. Average age at diagnosis of the first CRC was 45.7 years; 40.9% and 28.7% of the CRCs were located proximal to the splenic flexure and in the rectum, respectively. Thirty-eight percent of the colorectal cancer patients had synchronous and metachronous CRC. 34.4% and 25% of the CRCs were poor differentiation cancer and mucinous adenocarcinoma, respectively. Fourteen extracoloni tumors were found, and the hepatic cancer was the most common tumor type. Twenty-one patients whose median survival time was 5.7 years died during 1-23 years. Twenty-nine patients have survived for 1-28 years, 58.6%, 41.4% and 24.1% patients have survived for more than 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively; (2) All nine tumor-tissues showed microsatellite instability (MSI) at more than two loci. Four tumor-tissues lost hMSH2 protein expression and one lost hMLH1 protein expression. Three pathological germline mutations were identified from five genetically analyzed families; two of three mutations had not been reported previously as they were a transition from C to A in exon 14 (codon 743) of hMSH2 and a TTC deletion in exon 14 (codon 530) of hMLH1. Conclusion: Chinese HNPCC have specific clinicopathological features, such as early onset, propensity to involve the proximal colon, and high frequency of multiple CRCs, liver cancer more frequent than endometrial cancer. Chinese HNPCC showed relatively frequent germline mutation of mismatch repair (MMR) genes that correlated closely with high-level MSI and loss of expression of MMR genes protein. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 14 members from 12 different families fulfilling Amsterdam criteria II. mRNA of hMLH1 and hMSH2 was reversed with special primers and heat resistant reverse transcriptase. cDNA was amplified with expand long template PCR and cDNA sequencing analysis was followed. Results: Seven germline mutations were found in 6 families (6/12, 50%), in 4 hMLH1 and 3 hMSH2 mutations (4/12, 33.3%); (3/12, 25%). The mutation types involved 4 missense, 1 silent and 1 frame shift mutations as well as 1 mutation in the non-coding area. Four out of the seven mutations have not been reported previously. The 4 hMLH1 mutations were distributed in exons 8, 12, 16, and 19. The 3 hMSH2 mutations were distributed in exons 1 and 2. Six out of the 7 mutations were pathological, which were distributed in 5 HNPCC families. Conclusion: Germline mutations of hMLH1 and hMSH2 can be found based on cDNA sequencing so as to identify HNPCC family, which is highly sensitive and has the advantages of cost and time saving. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

30044447660	Diffraction enhanced imaging of breast tissue	For evaluating the X-ray diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI) technology in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, the massive samples of normal breast tissue and cancerous one were imaged by DEI method using hard X-rays from 4W1A beamline at the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). DEI images of both normal and cancerous breast tissues have been comparatively analyzed. The results show that diffraction images obtained at the top position of the rocking curve is clear enough and approximately display the structures of the soft tissue. The apparent absorption image is basically similar to the conventional mammography, and there are definite difficulties in distinguishing variant soft-tissues and its ability of finding cancerous soft-tissues is lower than the diffraction image. The inner structures of samples and the differences in shape, size, distribution and structure of the gland for normal and cancerous breast tissues can be clearly shown in refraction images. So, the DEI technology has high value in diagnosing breast cancer and may be an important complementary to early diagnostic method.

3242741141	Construction of a model used for the mismatch repair functional analysis in vitro and being used in the human colorectal cancer cell line and tumor tissue	Purpose: A model for the analysis of mismatch repair (MMR) function has been constructed to measure the mismatch repair function of human colorectal cancer cell and tumor tissue. The results have been compared with the results of microsatellite stability (MSS) assay. Evaluate the values of these two measurements in the basic research and clinical diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Methods: With the bacteriophage M13mp2 and its three derivates two heteroduplex DNA molecular has been constructed one with a single base mismatch, the other with two bases deletion. The heteroduplex DNA used as the template and TK6-a lymphoblastoid B-cell line with MMR competent ability make up of the model to analyze the MMR ability of all kinds of samples in vitro. Extract from Lovo-a human colorectal cancer cell line with hMSH2 homologous deletions in the exons 3 to 8 and tumor tissues of 1 case of HNPOC (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) and 1 cases of SRC (sporadic rectal cancer), which has been measurd by large T antigen dependent SV-40 DNA replication assay, has been incubated with the heteroduplex DNA. From the change of the percentage of the mixture plaques the functional status of MMR system has been evaluated. Five sites recommended by the international co-operation group of HNPCC have been measured to analyze the microsatellites in all the cell lines, tumor tissues and normal tissues of the patients. Results: The repair efficiency of TK6 to del(2) was more than 60%, to G·G was more than 50%. Ther Lovo efficiency was to del(2) less than 10%, G·G is less than 20%. The tumor tissue of a case of NHPCC was lack of MMR ability and a case of spordic rectal cancer (SRC) still maintained MMR proficiency. Both tumor and normal tissue of the HNPCC patients and SRC patient had been measured by the microsatellits assay. The HNPCC was MSI-H and the SRC was MSS. Conclusions: The whole MMR functional status of cell line and tissue can be measured by the model used for MMR functional analysis in vitro, which is sensitive and dependable. It's very useful to be used in the patients whose family history is not clear. But its operation is oomplex and need longer time to complete. The results of the functional analysis and microsatellite assay are concordance, which indicates the recommended sites used in the HNPCC are sensitive too. The microsatellite assay is stable and quick, which is suitable in the clinical diagnosis and treatment. It's meaningful to use these two measurements together in the mechanism research and classification of the colorectal cancer and in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of it.

33645157288	Infrared absorption of human breast tissues in vitro	The spectral characteristics of human breast tissues in normal status and during different cancerous stages have been investigated by synchrotron radiation based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) absorption spectroscopy. Thanks to the excellent synchrotron radiation infrared (IR) source, higher resolving power is achieved in SR-FTIR absorption spectra than in conventional IR absorption measurements. Obvious variations in IR absorption spectrum of breast tissues were found as they change from healthy to diseased, or say in progression to cancer. On the other hand, some specific absorption peaks were found in breast cancer tissues by SR-FTIR spectroscopic methods. These spectral characteristics of breast tissue may help us in early diagnosis of breast cancer. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33646041001	Micrometastases detected by cytokeratin 19 expression in sentinel lymph nodes of patients with early-stage cervical cancer	The purpose of this study was to detect micrometastases in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses for cytokeratin 19 (CK19) expression in early-stage cervical cancer. One hundred twenty-five SLNs were collected from 46 patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Conventional histopathologic techniques revealed 14 metastatic SLNs from 11 out of 46 patients. CK19 expression was detected by RT-PCR and IHC in all the 125 SLNs. Cervical cancer tissues from nine patients and five pelvic lymph nodes from the patients without tumor were utilized as positive and negative controls, respectively. All the metastastic SLNs on conventional histopathologic techniques were positive by either RT-PCR or IHC analyses, while all the positive controls were positive and all the negative controls were negative as expected. Of 35 patients without metastatic SLNs on conventional histopathologic techniques, the detection rate of micrometastases was 42.85% by RT-PCR and 20% by IHC analyses. RT-PCR and IHC were more sensitive to identify micrometastases in SLNs of patients with early-stage cervical cancer than routine pathology. These findings demonstrated that micrometastasis could be identified by molecular technique such as RT-PCR and IHC analyses for CK19 expression. RT-PCR was more sensitive to detect micrometastases in SLNs than IHC in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Therefore, molecular assessment of the SLNs may be a valuable tool to complement routine histologic examination of cervical cancer. The importance of micrometastases in SLNs is under close clinical observation to determine whether it can be used as a predicting factor to help us make decision whether to proceed with whole-pelvic lymph node dissection or as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome. © 2006, IGCS.

33750079295	Study of mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor -(A, C, D) genes and its effect on prognosis of breast cancer	Objective: To study mRNA expression of VEGF-(A, C, D) genes in breast carcinoma and its effect on prognosis. Methods: The mRNA expression of VEGF-(A, C, D) genes in 61 cases of primary breast carcinoma and 29 cases of benign mammary lesions was detected by TaqMan real-time reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) technology. The correlation between mRNA expression and various clinicopathologic parameters and survival data was analyzed. Results: The level of mRNA expression of VEGF-(A, C) genes was significantly higher in primary breast carcinomas (2.79 ± 1.31 and 3.33 ± 0.88 respectively) than in benign mammary lesions (1.59 ± 1.35 and 2.76 ± 0.55 respectively, P = 0.000 and 0.002 respectively). The percentage of VEGF-D mRNA expression was 73.77% in breast carcinomas, as compared to 51.72% in benign mammary lesions (P = 0.038). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the mRNA expression levels of VEGF-D gene between primary breast carcinomas and benign mammary lesions (P = 0.683). On the other hand, the ratio of VEGF-D mRNA expression to VEGF-C mRNA expression was lower in lymph node-positive than in lymph node-negative cases. This also correlated with the occurrence of nodal metastasis by uni- and multivariate analysis (P

33750864711	Real-time PCR analysis of β-catenin mRNA in sporadic colorectal cancers	Objective: To detect β-catenin mRNA levels in sporadic colorectal cancers (SCRC) and adjacent normal colorectal mucosa, and to investigate the association between the β-catenin mRNA level and its aberrant expression and clinicopathological parameters. Methods: The concentration of β-catenin mRNA in 81 SCRCs and 28 adjacent normal colorectal mucosa specimens was determined by TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The ratio of β-catenin cDNA copies/GAPDH cDNA copies was used to represent the mRNA expression level in different tissues. The β-catenin protein expression was determined by the EnVision two-step immunohistochemical method. Results: β-catenin mRNA levels in SCRCs (2.527 ± 2.284) were lower than those in the adjacent normal colorectal mucosa (5.003 ± 3.326), P < 0.05. In addition, β-catenin mRNA levels in lymph node-positive cases and tumors with ulcerative and infiltrating growth types were significantly lower (1.827 ± 1.288, 2.202 ± 2.035) than those in lymph node-negative cases and polypoid growth type tumors (3.359 ± 2.881, 3.108 ± 2.610), P < 0.05. No significant difference of β-catenin mRNA level was found between cases with aberrant β-catenin cytoplasm or nuclear expression and those without. Conclusions: SCRCs express lower levels of β-catenin mRNA than normal colorectal mucosa. Such lower level expression is associated with lymph node metastasis and tumors with ulcerative and infiltrative growth pattern. Aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of β-catenin appears unrelated to the lower mRNA levels. Quantitative detection of β-catenin mRNA may be a useful approach to monitor the biological behavior of SCRCs.

33947189543	Study of the correlation between HER-2 gene and lymphangiogenesis and their prognostic significance in human breast cancer	Objective: To demonstrate the molecular mechanism of poor prognosis in HER-2 overexpressing breast carcinoma, to study the correlation between angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and HER-2, and the effect of them in the progression and prognosis, so as to provide novel molecular markers for lymph node metastasis and prognosis in breast carcinoma. Methods: (1) By using TaqMan real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time qRT-PCR) technique and immunohistochemistry (IHC), the mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-C were detected in SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines before and after the interference with Herceptin. (2) Real-time qRT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of VEGF-C and -D genes in 67 cases of primary breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma. (3) 160 formmalin-fixed paraffin-embedded infiltrating ductal carcinomas were selected. The protein expression of HER-2, VEGF-C, lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) were detected by IHC. Result: (1) After interference with Herceptin, the VEGF-C mRNA and protein expression of sKBR-3 the cells decreased significantly. In primary breast cancer, the protein expression of HER-2 was positively correlated with VEGF-C protein expression (r = 0.215, P < 0.05). There was a significantly positive correlation between VEGF-C protein expression and LVD (r = 0.248, P < 0.01). (2) VEGF-C mRNA expression in the patients with lymph node metastasis was higher than that in the patients without lymph node metastasis (1.6 ± 0.5 vs 1.1 ± 0.5) (t = 2.196, P < 0.05). Logistic regression model showed HER-2, LVD and LVI were important factors influencing lymph node metastasis (all P < 0.05).

34147220791	Analysis of trace elements in breast tumor tissues	The variation of relative contents of some typical trace elements in normal breast tissues, benign breast tumor tissues and breast cancer tissues is studied by the synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) technique. According to the results of SR-XRF, there exist the same kinds of trace elements in various breast tissues, but their relative contents are different. The differences for Ca, Fe and Zn are obvious between normal and breast tumor tissues. Comparing the contents of elements in breast tumor tissues with normal ones, S, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu and Se are found to be of positive correlation, i.e. their contents in tumor tissues are increased; but K and Ca are of negative correlation. The contents of P in normal breast tissues are the same as in benign tissues, but a little decreasing in malignant ones. However, such correlation is positive for Fe and Zn in cancerous tissues, and negative in benign tissues. The above differences might be used to characterize changes that take place as breast tissues become diseased.

Methods: Germline mutations of MSH6 gene were detected by PCR-based DNA sequencing in 39 unrelated HNPCC probands fulfilling different clinical criteria in which MSH2 and MLH1 mutations were excluded. To further investigate the pathological effects of detected missense mutations, we analyzed the above related MSH6 exons using PCR-based sequencing in 137 healthy persons with no family history. The clinicopathological features were collected from the Archive Library of Cancer Hospital, Fudan University and analyzed. Results: Four germline missense mutations distributed in the 4th, 6th and 9th exons were observed. Of them, three were not found in international HNPCC databases and did not occur in 137 healthy controls, indicating that they were novel missense mutations. The remaining mutation which is consistent with the case H14 at c.3488A>T of exon 6 of MSH6 gene was also found in the controls, the rate was approximately 3.65% (5/137) and the type of mutation was not found in the international HNPCC mutational and SNP databases, suggesting that this missense mutation was a new SNP unreported up to date. Conclusion: Three novel missense mutations and a new SNP observed in the probands of Chinese HNPCC families, may play an important role in the development of HNPCC. © 2007 WJG. All rights reserved.

Methods: The germline mutations of MSH6 gene were detected by PCR based DNA sequencing in 39 unrelated HNPCC probands fulfilling different clinical criteria in which MSH2 and MLH1 mutations were excluded. The exons with missense mutations were analyzed using PCR sequencing in the germline genomic DNA of 137 healthy persons. The expression of MSH6 protein was detected by Envision immunohistochemistry staining in the tumor tissues of the mutational probands. Results: Six germline mutations of MSH6 gene were detected in 39 probands of Chinese HNPCC kindreds, and the mutations distributed in the exon 4, 6, 9 and 10. Four out of six mutations were missense mutation, one was nonsense mutation and the remaining one was insertion mutation in splice site. The results of sequecing for the exons with above four missense mutations in 137 healthy persons genomic DNA showed that 5 of 137 persons had the missense mutation of c.3488 A > T at codon 1163 of the 6th exon. The mutational rate was approximately 3.65%(5/137), so the mutation could be a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The remaining missense mutations were not found in any germline genomic DNA of 137 healthy persons. Positive expression of MSH6 protein had been identified in the tumor of the SNP proband while the tumors had negative MSH6 protein expression in the rest probands of germline mutation MSH6 gene. The types of mutations and their potential significance were determined by comparing the following databases: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, http://www.ensembl.org/homo-sapies, and http://www.insight-group.org. Five out of the six mutations had not been reported previously and they were new pathological mutations, the rest one was a new SNP. Conclusion: Germline mutations of MSH6 gene may play an important role in Chinese HNPCC kindreds fulfilling different clinical criteria. It is necessary to analyze the germline mutations of MSH6 gene using sequencing to identify HNPCC families in the probands in which MSH2 and MLH1 mutation were excluded.

37849038706	Two novel germline mutations of MLH1 and investigation of their pathobiology in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer families in China	Aim: To detect germline mutations of MLH1, and investigate microsatellite instability and expression of MLH1 in tumor tissues of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) with two novel germline mutations, and further investigate the pathobiology of the two novel mutations of MLH1. Methods: RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 12 patients from 12 different families that fulfilled the Amsterdam II Criteria for HNPCC. Germline mutations of MLH1 were determined by RT-PCR, followed by cDNA sequencing analysis. PCR-GeneScan analysis was used to investigate microsatellite instability with a panel of five microsatellite markers (BAT26, BAT25, D5S346, D2S123 and mfd15), along with immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of MLH1 protein in two patients'tumor tissues with novel mutations. Results: Three germline mutations were found in four patients, one of the mutations has previously been reported, but the other two, CGC-TGC at codon 217 of exon 8 and CCG←CTG at codon 581 of exon 16, have not been reported. The two patients' tumor tissues with novel mutations had high-frequency microsatellite instability that showed more than two unstable loci, and both tumors lost their MLH1 protein expression. Conclusion: The two novel germline mutations of MLH1 in HNPCC families i.e. CGC-TGC at codon 217 of exon 8 and CCG←CTG at codon 581 of exon 16, are very likely to have pathological significance. © 2007 WJG.

0033015810	Study of prognostic predictors for non-small cell lung cancer	Background: The outcome of treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poor. One of the reasons is that in many patients its biological behavior does not follow a definite pattern, and can not be accurately predicted prior to treatment. In the present study we have examined the significant prognostic predictors. Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight patients with NSCLC entered this study. They received surgery alone (95 cases) or combined therapy with postoperative irradiation (63 cases). Three types of data have been collected: (1) clinical characteristics: age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, weight loss, T stage, and N stage; (2) histopathology studies: histological types, tumor differentiation, status of vascular and lymphatic vessel invasions; (3) laboratory measurements by immunohistochemistry assay: oncoprotein overexpression, including pan-ras, c-myc, neu, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p53, and tumor cell proliferation by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Results: For the entire group, 5-year actuarial survival, local control and distant metastasis rates were 44, 63 and 40%, respectively. In the univariate analyses, T stage, N stage and lymphatic vessel invasion correlated to survival; T stage and N stage to local control; N stage, lymphatic vessel invasion and pan-ras protein positive stain to distant metastasis. When the index of oncoprotein positive stains was used, the higher index was associated with a higher distant metastasis rate. In the multivariate analyses, T stage, N stage and lymphatic vessel invasion could be independent predictors for survival; T stage for local control; N stage, lymphatic vessel invasion and index of positive oncoprotein stains for distant metastasis. Conclusions: Late T and N stages, lymphatic vessel invasion and multi-oncoprotein positive stains would predict poor prognoses for NSCLC. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

0033784038	Invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma in relation to urokinase-type plasminogen activator, its receptor and inhibitor	This study was designed to investigate the relationship of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPA receptor (uPAR), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) to invasion and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 in HCC was determined by immunohistochemistry, Northern blot, and an LCI-D20 nude mouse metastatic model of HCC. The overexpression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 was found in HCC, especially in the patients with portal cancer embolus, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Immunohistochemistry results showed that the rate of positive staining of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 were higher in HCC than those in the control groups consisting of cancer-adjacent tissue and normal liver tissue. In the case of HCC invasion, positive uPA and uPAR were seen in 16 and 19 out of 22 patients, respectively (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively, as compared with the patients without invasion). In those with portal cancer embolus and tumor metastasis, positive uPAR was eight out of eight and six out of six patients. In those with tumor recurrence, positive uPAR was 15 out of 17 patients (P < 0.01 vs no recurrence). In patients who died within 2 years after surgery, positive uPAR was 12 out of 12 patients (P < 0.01 vs survival), and positive PAI-1 was nine out of 12 patients (P < 0.05 vs survival). In those in which uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 were all positive staining, stronger cancer invasiveness and higher mortality were found (P < 0.05 vs patients with all negative staining). In 30 patients tested with Northern blot analysis, the results were similar to those tested with immunohistochemistry. Higher expression of uPA mRNA and PAI-1 mRNA were detected in tumor tissues and embolus. In the patients with positive signals of uPA mRNA and PAI-1 mRNA, invasive cases were found in seven out of 19 and eight out of 18 patients, respectively, which were significantly higher than those showing negative signals (P < 0.05). In the LCI-D20 nude mouse metastatic model of HCC (MMHCC), PAI-1 activity in plasma and tumor tissue increased with tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. At an advanced stage of MMHCC, PAI-1 activity rose to 15.4 ± 0.7 Au/ml in plasma and 0.8 ± 0.3 Au/mg in tumor extracts, which was significantly higher than 6.2 ± 1.8 Au/ml in plasma and 0.4 ± 0.1 Au/mg in extracts at an early stage (P ± 0.05). PAI-1 activity related to the changes of serum AFP and tumor progress were r = 0.9544 and r = 0.9648, respectively (P < 0.05). The data suggest that the expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 is increased in HCC, and related to the invasiveness, metastasis, and prognosis of HCC.

0033788411	Histological grading in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast	Objective: To study the significance of histological grading as a prognostic factor in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast. Methods: According to the Van Nuy's classification, 32 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast were divided into three groups. Results: Low grade (well differentiated, low grade DCIS) 12 patients (37.5%); Intermediate grade, 9 patients (28.1%); High grade (poorly differentiated DCIS) 11 patients (34.4%). Among the high grade DCIS, the histologic subtypes were comedo (9 patients), micropapillary (1 patient) and solid (1 patient). The positive expression of c-erbB-2, p53 and MIB-1 in high grade DCIS was higher than that in intermediate and low grade DCIS. The difference between high grade and low grade DCIS was significant (P<0.05). The expression of ER in high grade DCIS was lower than that in intermediate and low grade DCIS. Conclusions: Histological grading of breast ductal carcinoma in situ may be a good prognostic factor.

38849102332	Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma: A clinical, histopathological and phenotypic study of 15 cases	Objective: To analyse the clinical histopathological and immunophenotypic characteristics of primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL) in Chinese patients. Methods: Fifteen PCMZL patients were collected to evaluate the clinical histological features. The expression of CD20, CD79a, CD21, CD5, CD10, BCL2 and BCL10 were examined by immunohistological methods. Results: Within these 15 patients, 6 were male and 9 were female (mean age 61.2 years, median age 58 years). Eleven patients presented with lesions on the head and face, 3 patients on the back, and one patient in disseminated pattern. All cases presented with erythematous nodular lesions. Histologically, diffuse infiltration of lymphoid cells was seen in the dermis. In 10 of 15 cases, the infiltrated lymphoid cells formed reactive follicles or nodules. Neoplastic cells were CD20(+), CD79(+), BCL2(+), BCL10(+), CD5(-) and CD10(-). In 5 cases, the expression of CD43 was observed. CD21 staining could display the follicular patern. Conclusions: PCMZL usually involves the head and face, and more often affect the aged women. The combination of morphological features and immunostaining for BCL2 and BCL10 was useful for the diagnosis and differentiation.

38849170539	Abnormal expression of bcl-10 protein in extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa- associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma type	Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic role of nuclear expression of bcl-10 protein in extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type. Methods: One hundred and forty cases of MALT lymphoma were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University (including 38 cases from stomach, 35 cases from ocular adnexa, 16 cases from intestine, 15 cases from skin, 15 cases from salivary gland, 14 cases from lung, 3 cases from thyroid and 4 cases from other sites). Ten cases of reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit and 143 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma other than MALT lymphoma (including 20 cases of NK/T cell lymphoma, 20 cases of follicular lymphomas, 20 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphomas, 20 cases of nodal diffuse large cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 10 cases of gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 13 cases of nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 12 cases of mantle cell lymphoma, 11 cases of splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, 6 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, 3 cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma, 1 case of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and 1 case of plasmacytoma were used as controls. Immunohistochemical study for bcl-10, as well as dual staining with CD20, was performed by EnVision method in paraffin sections. Results: In reactive follicular hyperplasia of tonsil, bcl-10 was moderately or strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells, while the mantle cells were negative and the marginal zone cells and paracortical T cells showed weak staining. In the 5 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia of orbit, 2 were bcl-10-negative and the remaining 3 expressed bcl-10 in the cytoplasm of germinal center B cells. As for non-MALT lymphomas, 3 gastric DLBCL showed nuclear expression. The remaining cases showed variable cytoplasmic staining. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 was expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells. On the other hand, 92.1% (129/140) of MALT lymphoma were bcl-10 positive. Among those cases, 54.3% (76/140) showed cytoplasmic positivity and 37.9% (53/140) showed nuclear positivity. The nuclear positivity rate of bcl-10 in different anatomic sites was different. The staining was most intense in MALT lymphoma of ocular adnexa. Dual staining with CD20 showed that the bcl-10-positive cells were also CD20-positive, though the number of bcl-10-positive cells were less than that of CD20-positive cells. Conclusions: Bcl-10 expression in lymphoid hyperplasia is a universal phenomenon. Cytoplasmic expression of bcl-10 is seen in many different kinds of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and reactive lymphoid conditions. In some cases of lymphoma, bcl-10 is expressed in tumor cells but not in reactive lymphoid cells, suggesting a possible role of abnormal bcl-10 expression in tumorgenesis. Nuclear expression of bcl-10 is seen mainly in MALT lymphoma, especially when occurring in ocular adnexa and lung. This is in contrast to loss of bcl-10 expression in residual germinal center cells.

33344472203	Two novel germline mutations of MLH1 in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer family	Objective: To explore germline mutations of MLH1 in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and to investigate the pathobiology of novel detectable mutations of MLH1. Method: RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of 12 patients from 12 different families fulfilling the Amsterdam II Criteria of HNPCC. Germline mutations of MLH1 were determined by RT-PCR with gene specific primers, heat-resistance reverse transcriptase and long-template PCR polymerase, followed by cDNA sequencing analysis. PCR-Genescan analysis was used to further investigate microsatellite instability with a panel of 5 microsatellite markers (BAT26, BAT25, D5S346, D2S123 and Mfd1S), along with immunohistochemistry staining to detect the expression of MLH1 protein in the tumor tissues. Results: Four germline mutations were found in 4 patients, 2 of which were previously reported GTT→GAT mutation at codon 384 of exon 12, and the other two were novel mutations: CGC→TGC at codon 217 of exon 8 and CCG →CTG at codon 581 of exon 16. Two tumors with the novel mutations had high frequency microsatellite instability showing more than 2 instable loci (RER + phenotype), and both tumors lost their MLH1 protein expression. Conclusion: The two novel germline mutations of MLH1 identified in this study, i. e. CGC→ TGC at codon 217 of exon 8 and CCG→CTG at codon 581 of exon 16, are very likely to have pathological significance.

34247634776	Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease: A clinical and histopathologic study of 25 cases in China	Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease (CRDD) is a rare proliferative disorder of histiocytes with unknown etiology, broadly different from systemic Rosai-Dorfman disease. We present the largest series of CRDD, describing the clinical manifestation, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and follow-up course of 25 cases in China. Clinically, 39 skin lesions in 25 patients were divided into 3 main types: papulonodular type (79.5%), indurated plaque type (12.8%), and tumor type (7.7%). Extremities were the most frequently involved, followed by trunk and face. None of the patients was found to have visceral organ involvement or lymphadenopathy. Microscopically, CRDD was characterized by scattering, clusters or sheets of large polygonal histiocytes intermingled with a florid, mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The most important feature was emperipolesis, which can be highlighted by S-100 protein stain. Patch and bandlike infiltrate of numerous mature plasma cells around glands and vessels was a constant finding in all lesions. Neutrophils existed in all cases to a variable degree with 2 cases forming microabscess. Four cases were remarkable for fibrosis, and xanthomatous change was observed in 2 cases. Coexistence of localized Langerhans cell histiocytosis and CRDD was interestingly found in case 7, which was evidenced by CD1a stain. Clinical follow-up in 22 patients, ranging from 2 to 55 months, indicated that surgical excision was the exclusive effective treatment for CRDD. Partial or complete spontaneous remission was achieved in 7 patients within 6 to 55 months. Owing to its favorable outcome, CRDD should be differentiated from a variety of benign and malignant lesions. Recognition of its wide clinical spectrum and histologic features combined with S-100 protein stain can help to establish the correct diagnosis. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

40549101066	Identification of new mutated genes in microsatellite instable colon cancer with GINI method	Objective To identify new mutated gene in microsatellite instable colorectal carcinoma through GINI. Methods Microsatellite instable-high(MSI-H) colon cancer cell line HCT116, microsatellite stable(MSS) colon cancer cell line HT29, as well as control MSS breast cancer cell lines were treated by NMD inhibition drug emetine and actinomycin D. The changes of mRNA expression of drug treated and untreated cell lines were detected with whole genomic cDNA microarray. Candidate genes with specifically increased mRNA expression in HCT116 were screened for mutation with direct DNA sequencing, and their mutations were identified in 22 colon cancer cell lines and 30 fresh colon cancer tissues. Results Two new mutated genes ARV1 and ZNF294 were screened out in MSI-H colon cancer cell line HCT116, and further validated in 37. 5% and 87. 5% of 8 MSI-H colon cancer cell lines respectively, as well as in 35% of 20 MSI-H primary tumors. Conclusions GINI-the new gene screening method which based on NMD inhibition, can be used to identify new mutated genes more rapidly and efficiently relatively.

59049091930	Activation and clinicopathologic significance of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	Objective (1) To investigate the activation of AKT/mTOR signaling transduction pathway in DLBCL and its association with the expression of bcl-6 and some other clinical pathologic factors. (2) To estimation of the signaling pathway function in diverse subtypes of DLBCL and its potential value in the targeted treatment of DLBCL. Methods Immunohistochemical (IHC) EnVision staining was used to detect the expressions of pAKT and pmTOR in 100 DLBCL and 10 reactive hyperplasia fresh lymph node samples; TaqMan real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) technique was used to explore the expression of bcl-6 mRNA in the DLBCL samples. IHC staining was used to detect the expressions of bcl-6, CD10 and MUM1 in 75 of the 100 corresponding paraffin-embedded samples and these 75 DLBCL samples were subdivided into GCB and non-GCB subgroups. Results (1) The expression of pAKT and pmTOR was 76% (76/100) and 75% (75/100), respectively, and the expression of the two proteins correlated with each other. (2) The expression of bcl-6 protein and mRNA significantly correlated with each other. The expression of bcl-6 protein and mRNA in pAKT and pmTOR high-expression group was significandy lower than that in low-expression group (both P < 0.01). (3) The expression of pAKT and pmTOR in non-GCB group was 82. 5% (47/57) and 84.2% (48/57), respectively, which were significandy higher than that in GCB group, which showed an expression rate of 44.4% (8/18) and 44.4% (8/18), respectively (both P < 0.01). (4) The expression of pAKT and pmTOR in male was higher than that in female, and the percentage of patients with abnormal LDH in pAKT and pmTOR positive groups was higher than that in negative groups, although there were no statistical significance (both P > 0.05). There was no relationship between the expression of pAKT and pmTOR and age, sex, stage, KPS and B symptoms (P > 0.05). Conclusions Activation of AKT/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in the development of DLBCL, and it is closely related to the low or non-expression of bcl-6 and non-GCB subgroup. Molecules in this pathway might serve as the new targets in the treatment of certain group of DLBCL.

Methods: Forty-six patients with ulcerative colitis were randomly divided into the moxibustion with herbal medicine underneath group and the western medicine group. Thirty patients were treated with the above moxibustion and 16 patients with Salicylaye fapyridine (SASP). The colonic mucosa of 13 patients in the moxibustion group was observed by colonoscopy before and after the treatment. Mucin was also analyzed by H. E and AB-PAS staining. Results: Seventeen patients were clinically cured, 12 were improved and 1 unchanged in the moxibustion group. In the control group, 5 patients were clinically cured, 7 improved and 4 unchanged. Thirteen patients with active UC were taken as the subjects for histopathologic analysis in this study. The colonic mucosal lesions were remarkably improved and the characteristic of the mucin also changed. In most sections, the chronic inflammation of mucosa was geatly ameliorated (P<0.01). The inflammatory cell infiltratation much decreased and neutrophilis, disapeared in most sections (P<0.001). The goblet cells significantly increased (P<0.001); crypt paracrypt abscess or mucosal ulceration was seen (P<0.001). Conclusion: The rate of cure of ulcerative colitis by moxibustion with herbal medicine beneath is superior to that by SASP. This sort of moxibustion can effectively improve the colonic mucosal lesions and restore the proportion of mucoprotein to near normal.

0034943855	Nitric oxide synthase and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and the correlation with angiogenesis	Objective: To analyze the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its relation to angiogenesis. Methods: Tissue sections from 71 HCC patients were examined immunohistochemically for protein expression of iNOS, eNOS, and VEGF. Microvessal density (MVD) was counted by endothelial cells immunostained by anti-CD34 antibody. Results: Positive immunostaining for iNOS, eNOS was detected in 83.1% and 85.9% of HCC respectively. INOS and eNOS were not detected in normal hepatic tissue. MVD was 34.3±1.5/HP and 38.6±1.6/HP in HCC with positive staining for iNOS and VEGF while it was 31.2± 2.8/HP, and 22.4± 2.0/HP in HCC with negative staining for iNOS and VEGF (P<0.01). A correlation between NOS expression and VEGF in HCC was not observed. Conclusion: iNOS and eNOS may play a role in malignant transformation f post-hepatic cirrhosis. The expression of iNOS and VEGF favors angiogenesis of HCC.

0034948560	APC and K-ras gene mutation in aberrant crypt foci of human colon	Aim: To study the genetic alteration in ACF and to define the possibility that ACF may be a very early morphological lesion with molecular changes, and to explore the relationship between ACF and colorectal adenoma even carcinoma. Methods: DNA from 35 CRC, 15 adenomas, 34 ACF and 10 normal mucus was isolated by means of microdissection. Direct gene sequencing of K-ras gene including codon 12, 13 and 61 as well as the mutation cluster region (MCR) of APC gene was performed. Results: K-ras gene mutation frequency in ACF, adenoma and carcinoma was 17.6% (6/34), 13.3% (2/15), and 14.3% (5/35) respectively, showing no difference (P > 0.05) in K-ras gene mutation among three pathologic procedures. The K-ras gene mutation in adenoma, carcinoma and 4 ACF restricted in codon 12 (GGT→GAT), but the other 2 mutations from ACF located in codon 13 (GGC→GAC). K-ras gene mutation was found more frequently in older patients and patients with polypoid cancer. No mutation in codon 61 was found in the three tissue types. Mutation rate of APC gene in adenoma and carcinoma was 22.9% (8/35) and 26.7% (4/15), which was higher than ACF (2.9%) (P < 0.05). APC gene mutation in carcinoma was not correlated with age of patients, location, size and differentiation of tumor. Conclusion: ACF might be a very early morphological lesion in the tumorgenesis of colorectal tumor. The morphological feature and gene mutation status was different in ACF and adenoma. ACF is possibly putative "microadenoma" that might be the precursor of adenoma. In addition, the development of a subgroup of colorectal carcinomas might undergo a way of "normal epithelium → ACF → carcinomas".

43049136639	Regulatory mechanism of electroacupuncture in irritable bowel syndrome: Preventing MC activation and decreasing SP VIP secretion	The efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) for treating patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS has been confirmed in the authors' former research, but the regulatory mechanism of EA in IBS is still unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between the effect of EA on treating IBS rats and the activation and proliferation of mast cell (MC), the secretion of substance P(SP), and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The IBS rat model was set up with stress of binding limbs and colorectal distention. All rats were randomly assigned to four groups (Normal, Model, Tegaserod and EA). Hematoxylin and eosin staining has been used to observe the pathological change in the rats' colonic mucosa and an AWR scoring system has been applied to evaluate improvement of visceral hypersensitivity in various methods of the different groups. Toluidine blue improved method (TBI) and immunohistochemistry have also been involved in observations of mucous mast cells in the colon, change of c-fos positive cells, and secretion of SP, SPR, VIP, VIPR in the local colon. Firstly, the threshold of visceral sensitivity in the rats model with IBS was remarkably reduced (P < 0.01). The MC count in colonic mucosa and c-fos positive cells count increased significantly (P < 0.01) with positive correlation within each. Secondly, EA on ST-25 and Tegaserod pouring into the stomach can inhibit the proliferation and activation of MC in the colon and regulate secretion of SP, SPR, VIP, VIPR (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), while the effect of EA is obviously superior to Tegaserod. We concluded, firstly, that the abnormal proliferation and activation of mucous mast cells in the colon, and oversecretion of neuropeptides such as SP, VIP and their receptors could be one of key mechanisms of etiology of IBS. Secondly, the inhibition of activation and proliferation and the secretion of SP, VIP could be major effects of EA when treating rats with IBS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

44249092320	Assessment of a HER2 scoring system for gastric cancer: Results from a validation study	Aims: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression/ amplification is implicated in the development of various solid tumour types. Validated methods and scoring systems for evaluating HER2 status exist in breast cancer, but not in gastric cancer. The aim was to establish a HER2 scoring system for gastric cancer to identify suitable patients for enrolment in a trial of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in advanced metastatic gastric cancer. Methods and results: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples were tested for HER2 status using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) pharmDx™ kit (Dako Denmark A/S). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using the HercepTest™ (Dako). Concordance between FISH and IHC was 93.5% in 168 evaluable samples. Eleven samples were scored as FISH+ but IHC- or equivocal. Conclusions: IHC/FISH discrepancies were attributed to basolateral membranous immunoreactivity of glandular cells resulting in incomplete membranous reactivity and/or a higher rate of tumour heterogeneity in gastric cancer compared with breast cancer. With modifications to the IHC scoring system, the HercepTest™ is considered valid for the identification of HER2+ gastric tumours for this clinical trial. Correlation of HER2 scores with clinical outcomes will be needed to determine which patients might benefit from trastuzumab therapy. © 2008 TARGOS Molecular Pathology GmbH.

53449096633	Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma: A clinicopathologic, lmmunophenotypic, and molecular study of 22 Asian cases according to WHO-EORTC classification	Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTL) is defined as a rare cytotoxic α/β T-cell lymphoma characterized by primary involvement of subcutaneous tissue mimicking panniculitis and a predominant CD3/CD4/CD8 phenotype in 2005 World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (WHO-EORTC) classification for cutaneous lymphomas. We presented a detailed study of SPTL, describing clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features of 22 cases in China. Strict diagnostic criteria according to the WHO-EORTC definition were applied to the diagnosis of all SPTL cases. Besides the common features described before, unusual CD4/CD8 and CD4/CD8 T-cell phenotypes were noted in 2 of our cases, respectively. CD30 was negative in all cases and CD56 was focally positive in 2 cases. Mortality in cases with angioinvasion (75%) was significantly higher than that in cases without angioinvasion (14.3%). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection was detected in 1 immunocompetent patient by in situ hybridization. The frequency of rearranged TCRB, TCRG, and TCRD genes detected by BIOMED-2 multiplex polymerase chain reaction tubes was 80%, 67%, and 13%, respectively, with a total clonality detection rate of 100%. Clinical follow-up was available in 18 patients, ranging from 6 to 80 months. Most patients obtained complete or partial remission after therapy including one accompanied with EBV infection; 5 patients died: 3 of disease progression, 1 of severe infection, and 1 of complications caused by diabetes and hypertension. We conclude that SPTL as a cytotoxic lymphoma derived from α/β T cell has a predominant CD4/CD8 phenotype, but unusual CD4/CD8 and CD4/CD8 phenotypes do exist. Owing to its indolent clinical course and relatively high survival rate, SPTL should be differentiated from cutaneous γ/δ T-cell lymphoma. EBV is generally absent in SPTL but can rarely be detected especially in Asian population. Angioinvasion is a poor prognostic factor in SPTL. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

54049145155	Mutations of the PIK3CA gene in diffuse large B cell lymphoma	The PI3K/AKT pathway might be involved in the development of some certain diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by as-yet unclear mechanisms. PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 were investigated in 76 primary human DLBCLs, 3 DLBCL cell lines (LY1, LY8, and LY10), and 9 related samples using polymerase chain reaction-based sequence analysis to assess the possible relevance of PIK3CA mutations in DLBCL to the PI3K/AKT pathway activation. AKT phosphorylation (pAKT) of 3 DLBCL cell lines and 76 primary DLBCL samples was also detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. All 3 cell lines showed high levels of pAKT, and 72.4% (55/76) of the DLBCLs expressed pAKT at various levels, indicating the activation of AKT. However, no mutation was found in exons 9 or 20 in PIK3CA in any of the 3 cell lines. Only 1 out of 76 primary DLBCLs (1.32%) harbored an exon 9 mutation, and no exon 20 mutation was detected. The case with mutations contained 3 mutation points. One was C.1634A > C resulting in E545A, which was in a previously reported hotspot. The other 2 were novel C.1658G > C and c.1659delT frameshift mutations. We conclude that the PI3K/AKT pathway is activated in DLBCL and that PIK3CA is rarely mutated in DLBCL, indicating there could be some other PI3K-pathway activation mechanisms operative in DLBCL.

57649140513	Abnormal BCL10 nuclear expression and chromosomal translocation in ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas	Objective: To detect the BCL10 expression and several types of chromosomal translocations [including t (11;18)/AP12-MALTI; t (1;14)/ IgH-BCL10 and t (14;18)/MALT1-IgH] in ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (OA-MALT lymphomas). Methods: Sixty OA-MALT lymphomas were collected from Cancer Hospital of Fudan University. BCL10 was detected by immunohistochemical studies, and API2-MALT1 fusion gene, BCL10, MALT1 and IgH chromosomal abnormalities were detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the relation between nuclear BCL10 expression and chromosomal translocation. Results: BCLIO expressed in 85.0% (51/60) OA-MALT lymphomas. Among these positive cases, 25 cases (41.7%) were expressed in the cytoplasm, and 26 cases (43.3%) were expressed in the nucleus. FISH results showed that no chromosomal abnormalities related with BCL10 and IgH genes, except 2 cases with API2-MALT1 fusion gene. Under statistic of Fisher exact test, nuclear BCL10 expression and API2-MALT1 fusion gene were two independent factors (P > 0.05). Conclusions: BCL10 nuclear expression is common in OA-MALT lymphomas and may be used as a potential marker for the diagnosis of MALT lymphomas arising from ocular adnexa. Aberrant chromosomal translocations reported in the other sites MALT lymphomas are rare in OA-MALT lymphomas.

6044223545	Activation of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin/4E-BP1 pathway by ErbB2 overexpression predicts tumor progression in breast cancers	The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/4E-BP1 pathway is considered to be a central regulator of protein synthesis, involving the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The inhibitors of mTOR as anticancer reagents are undergoing active evaluation in various malignancies including breast cancer. However, the activation status of the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway and its potential roles in breast cancers remain unknown. Thus, we examined 165 invasive breast cancers with specific antibodies for the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 by immunohistochemistry and compared them with normal breast epithelium, fibroadenoma, intraductal hyperplasia, and ductal carcinoma in situ. We discovered that the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 increased progressively from normal breast epithelium to hyperplasia and abnormal hyperplasia to tumor invasion. Phosphorylated Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 were positively associated with ErbB2 overexpression. Survival analysis showed that phosphorylation of each of these three markers was associated with poor disease-free survival independently. In vitro, we further confirmed the causal relationship between ErbB2 overexpression and mTOR activation, which was associated with enhanced invasive ability and sensitivity to a mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Our results, for the first time, demonstrate the following: (a) high levels of phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and 4E-BP1 in breast cancers, indicating activation of the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in breast cancer development and progression; (b) a link between ErbB2 and the Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway in breast cancers in vitro and in vivo, indicating the possible role of Akt/mTOR activation in ErbB2-mediated breast cancer progression; and (c) a potential role for this pathway in predicting the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, especially those treated with mTOR inhibitors.

63449141241	MLH1 promoter germline-methylation in selected probands of Chinese hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer families	Aim: To detect the MLH1 gene promoter germline-methylation in probands of Chinese hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and to evaluate the role of methylation in MLH1 gene promoter and molecular genetics in screening for HNPCC. Methods: The promoter germline methylation of MLH1 gene was detected by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in 18 probands from unrelated HNPCC families with high microsatellite-instability (MSI-H) phenotype but without germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 genes. At the same time, 6 kindreds were collected with microsatellite-stability (MSS) phenotype but without germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 genes as controls. The results of MSP were confirmed by clone sequencing. To ensure the reliability of the results, family H65 with nonsense germline mutation at c.2228C > A in MSH2 gene was used as the negative control and the cell line sw48 was used as the known positive control along with water as the blank control. Immunochemical staining of MLH1 protein was performed with Envision two-step method in those patients with aberrant methylation to judge whether the status of MLH1 gene methylation affects the expression of MLH1 protein. Results: Five probands with MLH1 gene promoter methylation were detected in 18 Chinese HNPCC families with MSI-H phenotype but without germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 genes. Two of the five probands from families H10 and H29 displayed exhaustive-methylation, fulfilling the Japanese criteria (JC) and the Amsterdam criteria (AC), respectively. The other 3 probands presented part-methylation fulfilling the AC. Of the 13 probands with unmethylation phenotype, 8 fulfilled the JC and the Bethesda guidelines (BG), 5 fulfilled the AC. The rate of aberrant methylation in MLH1 gene in the AC group (22.2%, 4/18) was higher than that in the JC/BG groups (5.6%, 1/18) in all HNPCC families with MSI-H phenotype but without germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 genes. However, no proband with methylation in MLH1 gene was found in the families with MSS phenotype and without germline mutations in MSH2, MLH1 and MSH6 genes. No expression of MLH1 protein was found in tumor tissues from two patients with exhaustive-methylation phenotype, whereas positive expression of MLH1 protein was observed in tumor tissues from patients with partial methylation phenotype (excluding family H42 without tumor tissue), indicating that exhaustive-methylation of MLH1 gene can cause defective expression of MLH1 protein. Conclusion: Methylation phenotype of MLH1 gene is correlated with microsatellite phenotype of MMR genes, especially with MSI-H. Exhaustive-methylation of MLH1 gene can silence the expression of MLH1 protein. MLH1 promoter methylation analysis is a promising tool for molecular genetics screening for HNPCC. © 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

65549126299	Clinicohistopathologic features of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease: A study of 14 cases	Objective: To improve the diagnosis of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease (CRDD) by investigating the clinical, pathological and immunophenotypic features of this disease. Methods: The data of 14 cases of CRDD were collected. The clinical category was classified according the features of clinical manifestations of these patients. The histopathologic and immunchistochemical studies were performed in all cases. Results: The skin lesions of 14 patients were divided into 3 main types: papulonodular type (64.7%), infiltrating plaque type (5.9%) and tumor type (29.4%). No other systemic disease such as lymphadenopathy was found. Mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in the dermis and subcutis, mainly lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a variable number of S-100 positive histiocytes, was shown by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The presence of lymphocytes engulfed within the histiocytic cytoplasm, namely emperipolesis, was seen. Few histiocytes between vascular spaces were found in one case. Lymph follicle, fibrosis, panniculitis-like change and vasculitis-like change were seen in a few cases. Conclusions: The classification of the skin lesions into three types, combined with histopathologic and immunophenotypic features, are helpful for the diagnosis of CRDD, especially for the differentiation of it from various other cutaneous neoplastic and non-neoplastic skin diseases.

67650681871	Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with cutaneous manifestations: A clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic and molecular study of three cases	Background Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is an extremely rare type of malignant lymphoma characterized by exclusive or predominant growth of neoplastic cells within the lumen of blood vessels. Cases in the literature predominantly involve the skin and central nervous system, with special emphasis on the 'cutaneous variant'. Methods Three cases of IVLBCL with cutaneous manifestations, including two systemic IVLBCL and one cutaneous variant, were described in this study. In all cases, clinical presentation and follow-up data were meticulously evaluated and immunophenotypic and molecular studies were performed. Results All three cases displayed the B-cell phenotype and showed monoclonality with immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. Bcl2 was expressed in the two systemic IVLBCL cases with fatal outcomes. The third patient with the 'cutaneous variant' achieved complete remission and a longer survival time of 15 months after chemotherapy. Conclusions Skin manifestations and neurological findings, although to different degrees, are important clues to the diagnosis of IVLBCL. As most IVLBCL are grouped into the post-germinal center B-cell subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Bcl2 expression may be correlated with a worse prognosis in IVLBCL. The cutaneous variant of IVLBCL has a significantly better outcome than that of systemic IVLBCL. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

67650092976	Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase pin1 is critical for the regulation of pkb/akt stability and activation phosphorylation	The serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) plays a pivotal role in diverse cellular functions. Elevated expression of activated Akt has been detected in a wide variety of human cancers; however, the mechanism of Akt protein stability regulation remains unclear. In this study, we showed a strong correlation between the expression levels of an oncogenic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 and levels of Akt phosphorylation at S473 in multiple cancer types (P0.0001). Akt-pS473 status combined with Pin1 expression levels predicted a poorer prognosis than did either one alone in patients with breast cancer (P0.0052). We further showed that Pin1 regulated Akt stability and phosphorylation on S473 through the phosphorylated Thr-Pro motifs of Akt. These motifs are conserved evolutionary and are required for the maintenance of Akt stability and its interaction with Pin1. In addition, repressing Pin1 expression through either homologue Pin1 knockout or small interfering RNA-mediated knockingdown compromised its ability to protect Akt from degradation. Our results show how Akt protein stability is regulated by the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 and highlight the importance of this oncogenic network in human disease pathogenesis. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

68749099992	Neutrophil/eosinophil-rich type of primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma: A clinicopathological, immunophenotypic and molecular study of nine cases	Aims: To elucidate the clinicopathological, immunophenotypic and molecular features of neutrophil/eosinophil-rich primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (CALCL), and to emphasize the cutaneous manifestations, differential diagnosis and prognosis of this peculiar entity. Methods and results: We described the clinical presentations, histopathology, immunophenotype, molecular features and follow-up courses of nine neutrophil/eosinophil-rich CALCL cases. Various clinical lesions including multiple nodules, plaques and solitary exophytic masses with or without ulceration or crusting were noted in nine patients. Two patients died of disease progression, with one developing multiple lymph node involvement. Histologically, cohesive sheets or small clusters of neoplastic cells were admixed with large numbers of neutrophils and/or eosinophils, representing 10-40% of cells per high-power field. All nine cases showed T-cell phenotypes. The frequency of rearranged TCRB, TCRG and TCRD genes in six cases with available paraffin-embedded tissue was 100%, 83% and 33%, respectively. Conclusions: Neutrophil/eosinophil-rich CALCL should be differentiated from various infectious and non-infectious diseases, especially from non-neoplastic cutaneous CD30+ infiltrates rich in neutrophils and eosinophils. Precise correlation of clinical presentation, morphological features, phenotypic and molecular analysis can help to establish the correct diagnosis. Whether this rare variant has a significantly different prognosis from classical CALCL needs further investigation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Limited.

70149101539	Down-regulation of protein and mRNA expression of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in colon tissue of ulcerative colitis patients by partition-herb moxibustion	Our previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of partition-herb moxibustion on ulcerative colitis (UC) rats. However, the mechanism of actions of partition-herb moxibustion is still unclear. Most Chinese acupuncturists believe that partition-herb improves the effect of moxibustion therapy. However, this argument lacks confirming experimental and clinical evidence. So, whether partition-herb does play a role in the mechanism of actions of partition-herb moxibustion was reported in this paper. A total of 123 patients were randomly divided into the partition-herb moxibustion group and the control group (partition-bran moxibustion group). Fourteen patients dropped out of the study. Finally, 109 patients finished the intervention. Sixty-one patients with UC received partition-herb moxibustion and 48 patients with UC received partition-bran moxibustion for 72 treatments, one treatment per day, every 12 treatments with an interval of 3 days. The expressions of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the colonic mucosa tissue in mild patients with UC were assayed by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Histology of the colon also was observed at entry and after 72 treatments. Clinical therapeutic effect in partition-herb moxibustion was significantly better than those in partition-bran moxibustion (P < 0.05). Protein and mRNA expression of IL-8, ICAM-1 in the patients was inhibited by both partition-herb moxibustion and partition-bran moxibustion, of those the inhibition in the partition-herb moxibustion group was more obvious (P < 0.01). Partition-herb moxibustion was shown to significantly improve the histology of the colon, and partition-herb was shown to improve the therapeutic effect of moxibustion on treatment of UC patients. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

72249119430	Prevalence of API2-MALT1 fusion gene in gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas and diffuse large B cell lymphomas	Objective: To investigate the difference of the prevalence of t(11;18) (q21;q21)/API2-MALT1 fusion gene between gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Methods: A total of 57 cases gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas (38 gastric and 19 intestinal lymphomas), 32 DLBCL (28 gastric and 4 intestinal lymphomas) and 7 cases gastric DLBCL accompanied MALT lymphoma were collected from the Cancer Hospital of Fudan University. API2-MALT1 fusion gene was detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using both dual fusion translocation and break apart probes. Results: Among gastrointestinal MALT lymphomas, API2-MALT1 fusion gene was found in 12 of 57 cases (21.1%, 10 gastric and 2 intestinal lymphomas). In contrast, the fusion gene was not found in all 32 DLBCL and 7 gastric DLBCL with MALT lymphoma component. There was statistical significant difference between two groups (χ

75149119355	Aberrant expression and mutation of β-catenin in sporadic colorectal cancer	AIM: To observe the aberrant expression and mutation of β-catenin in sporadic colorectal cancer (SCRC) and explore their correlation with clinicopathological features. METHODS: Ninety SCRC samples and 22 sporadic colorectal adenoma samples were used in this study. The aberrant expression of β-catenin was detected by immunohistochemistry. PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing were used to identify β-catenin gene mutations. RESULTS: In normal colorectal mucosa, β-catenin was distributed on the plasma membrane, without aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation. The aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear expression rates of β-catenin in SCRC were higher than those in sporadic colorectal adenomas (88.9% vs 59.1% and 41.1% vs 18.2%, respectively, P < 0.05), respectively. The aberrant cytoplasmic expression of β-catenin was significantly correlated with tumor growth pattern and differentiation (P < 0.05). The aberrant nuclear expression rate of β-catenin in ulcerative lesions was higher than that in protruding lesions (50.0% vs 26.5%, P < 0.05). Aberrant nuclear expression of β-catenin was frequently observed in the invasive front of SCRC. β-catenin gene mutation was identified in one out of 90 SCRC samples, but was not identified in all sporadic colectoral adenoma samples. CONCLUSION: Aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of β-catenin may play an important role in the development and progression of SCRC. β-catenin mutation may not be the primary cause of aberrant β-catenin expression in SCRC.

77449151833	Mutations of NFKBIA in biopsy specimens from Hodgkin lymphoma	To determine the possible alteration of the inhibitor κBα (HUGO-approved symbol, NFKBIA) gene in Chinese Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients, NFKBIA mRNA and protein expression in 22 primary HL patients were examined. Individual tumor cells were used for amplification to obtain the NFKBIA gene, and the polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced. Compared with reactive surrounding lymphocytes, inhibitor κBα protein (IκBα) expression was weaker in the cytoplasm of H-RS (Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg) cells. NFKBIA mRNA was strongly expressed in H-RS cells from HL sections, and little was detected in the reactive surrounding lymphocytes. A total of 37.5% of the patients with HL had mutations in the NFKBIA gene. Some mutations possibly resulted in C-terminally truncated form of the IκBα. These data suggest that the impairment of the IκBα functions was produced during the pathogenesis of the tumor cell clone in Chinese HL patients. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemical study by Envision method were carried out in 44 archival cases of CALCL. The clinical information and follow-up data were analyzed. Results: The patients presented with skin nodules, masses or plaques, sometimes associated with ulceration. The commonest sites of involvement were the extremities. Follow-up data were available in 39 patients. The overall survival rate was 87. 2% (34/39). Disease relapses were detected in 46. 2% (18/39) of the patients. Statistical analysis indicated that patients older than 50 years of age or with no less than two involved anatomic sites were more likely to have disease relapses (P < 0.05). Histologically, 31 cases were classified as common variant, 6 cases as small cell variant and 7 cases as neutrophil/eosinophil-rich variant Immunohistochemical study showed that the rates of expression of CD30, CD45, CD45RO, CD43, CD3, cytotoxic protein and epithelial membrane antigen were 100% (44/44), 91.2% (31/34), 82.6% (19/23), 94.7% (18/19), 70.0% (28/40), 73.3% (22/30) and 31. 8% (7/22), respectively.

77955719550	Germline mutation analysis of hPMS2 gene in Chinese families with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer	AIM: To study the germline mutation of hPMS2 gene in 26 unrelated Chinese hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) probands and to fulfill the screening strategy for HNPCC in Chinese. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood. To avoid the interference of pseudogene in detection of the remaining 11 exons (exon 1-5, 9, 11-15), long-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to amplify the complete coding region of hPMS2 gene firstly. Then 1/8 of the PCR products were used as template to amplify the individual exon respectively and DNA sequencing was done. Direct DNA sequencing of the conventional PCR products of exon 6, 7, 8 and 10 of hPMS2 gene was performed. The same analysis was made in 130 healthy persons without family histories of HNPCC to further investigate the pathological effects of the detected missense mutation. RESULTS: One HNPCC proband fulfilled Bethesda guidelines and was found to carry the germline mutation of hPMS2 gene, which has not been reported in Chinese HNPCC families. It was a missense mutation at c.1532C>T of exon 11. It was detected in three controls as well with an occurrence rate of 2.3% (3/130). Since it could not be found in the PMS2-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database, this missense mutation is a new SNP unreported up to date. Meanwhile, 260 reported SNPs of hPMS2 gene were detected in the 26 HNPCC probands. The 2nd and 5th exons were probably the hot SNP regions of hPMS2 gene in Chinese HNPCC families involving 53.1% of all reported SNP. CONCLUSION: The germline mutation of hPMS2 gene may be rare in Chinese HNPCC families. The 2nd and 5th exons are hot SNP regions of hPMS2 gene. © 2010 Baishideng.

77955818999	Centrally necrotizing carcinoma of the breast: Clinicopathological analysis of 33 cases indicating its basal-like phenotype and poor prognosis	Aims: To investigate the clinicopathological features and immunophenotype of centrally necrotizing carcinoma (CNC) of the breast to ascertain its relationship to basal-like phenotype and its prognosis. Methods and results: The clinical and pathological characteristics of 33 CNCs were reviewed. Immunohis-tochemical study of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, cytokeratin (CK) 818, high-molecular-weight CK (34E12), CK56, CK14, CK17, smooth muscle antigen, p63, vimentin and epidermal growth factor receptor was performed. The striking feature of CNC was a central, necrotic or acellular zone surrounded by a ring-like area of viable tumour cells. The central zone showed three morphological types: predominance of coagulative necrosis (21 cases), predominance of fibrosis and scar tissue (nine cases) and infarction (three cases). Tumour cells displayed invasive ductal carcinoma of high grade. The expression rate of basal-like markers was higher than that of myoepithelial markers (87.9% versus 46.2%). Basal-like subtype was shown by 63.6% of cases. The expression rate of CK56 (90.5%) was highest among basal-like markers. Follow-up data of 19 patients were available. Median progression-free survival was 15.5 months. In 12 patients (63.2%), local recurrence andor distant metastasis developed (median time to recurrence andor metastasis, 14.0 months). Conclusions: CNC has distinctive morphological features, which mostly exhibit a basal-like immunophenotype and poor prognosis. CNC is a typical representative of basal-like breast cancer. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Limited.

Methods More than 2000 cases of renal tumors were retrospectively reviewed. Three cases of melanotic epithelioid clear cell tumor were identified. Immunohistochemical study was carried out using the paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Electron microscopy was also performed in 1 case. Results Amongst the 3 cases studied, the male-to-female ratio is 1:2. Histologically, 2 cases showed a clear cell carcinoma-like pattern. Papillary structures covered by clear cells and eosinophilic cells were observed in 1 case. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells in all cases expressed HMB 45. Two of them were also positive for Melan A. The staining for epithelial markers and S-100 protein was negative. Melanosomes were not identified by ultrastructural examination. Conclusions Melanotic epithelioid clear cell tumor is a rarely seen neoplasm of kidney. There are some histologic overlaps with renal cell carcinoma, epithelioid angiomyolipoma and melanoma. Immunohistochemical study is useful in confirming the diagnosis. The tumor represents a morphologic variant of epithelioid angiomyolipoma.

79955578470	Establishment and characterization of a nude mice model of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	Objective To establish a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)-mice model using human DLBCL cell line LY8, to investigate its characteristics of growth and to provide a model for in vivo study of DLBCL pathogenesis and treatment. Methods LY8 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice. Harvested tumor tissues were cut into small pieces of 1. 5 mm × 1. 5 mm × 1. 5 mm and implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor growth was visualized and the histologic characteristics were documented. Expression of LCA, CD20, CD79α, Ki-67, CD3, CD45RO, bcl-6, MUM-1, CD10 and bcl-2 were examined by using immunohistochemistry. IgH clonal rearrangement and status of three microsatellite loci (D14S68, D18S69, D20S199) in the xenografted tumor samples and the parental cell line LY8 were detected using PCR amplification followed by PAGE. Results The subcutaneous xenograft DLBCL model was successfully established by using cell line LY8, and a stable growth was achieved up to the 9th generation. The tumor in each generation showed similar growth characteristics and the rate of subcutaneous tumor formation was 91. 9% (114/124). The tumor growth was observed from the 2nd week after implantation, reaching 1. 3 cm in major diameter at the 3rd week and 2. 0 cm at the 4th week. The tumor had identical morphological characteristics with those of human DLBCL, and expressed LCA, CD20, CD79α, bcl-6, MUM-1 , CD10 and bcl-2. The tumor of xenograft mice and cell line LY8 showed identical IgH rearrangement and microsatellite length. Conclusions A humanDLBCL bearing mouse model was successfully established. The mice model is similar to human counterpart with high stability and repeatability. Therefore, it provides an ideal animal model for in vivo studies of the biological characteristics and treatment of DLBCL.

79956146337	FOXP1 expression and its clinicopathologic significance in nodal and extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	The aims of this study were to investigate FOXP1 expression in nodal and extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and its association with the subclassification and other clinicopathologic parameters of DLBCL. Expression of FOXP1, CD10, Bcl6, MUM1, and Bcl2 was detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray sections. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the overall survival of patients, and the log-rank test was used to compare survival differences between groups with different FOXP1 protein expressions. Expression of FOXP1 was detected in 67.4% (95/141) of DLBCLs. FOXP1 expression in non-GCB (67/90, 74.4%) was significantly higher than that in GCB (28/51, 54.9%) (p<0.05). FOXP1 expression in MUM1-positive cases (62/81, 76.5%) was significantly higher than that in MUM1-negative cases (33/60, 55%) (p<0.01). FOXP1 expression was positively correlated with Bcl2 (p<0.05) in non-GCB among nodal DLBCL cases. Among the extranodal group, patients with FOXP1 expression had a significantly inferior OS compared to those with negative FOXP1 expression (p<0.05), which was not seen in nodal group. In conclusion, FOXP1 expression might be involved in the tumorigenesis of both nodal and extranodal DLBCL. The most striking finding of this study was that FOXP1 expression had an adverse effect on survival of patients with extranodal DLBCL, which indicated that FOXP1 function might be mediated by different mechanisms in nodal and extranodal DLBCLs. FOXP1 might play a role in the pathogenesis of nodal non-GCB DLBCL through the pathways in which Bcl2 was involved, and it might be a second important biomarker for non-GCB. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

0035683559	Clinicopathological and molecular genetic analysis of 4 typical Chinese HNPCC families	Aim: To study the clinicopathological and molecular genetic characteristics of typical Chinese hereditary nonpolyposis cotorectal cancer (HNPCC) families. Methods: Four typical Chinese HNPCC families were analyzed using microdissection, microsatellite instability analysis, immunostaining of hMSH2 and hMLH1 proteins and direct DNA sequencing of hMSH2 and hMLH1 genes. Results: All five tumor tissues of 4 probands from the 4 typical Chinese HNPCC families showed microsatellite instability at more than two loci (MSI-H or RER + phenotype). Three out of the 4 cases lost hMSH2 protein expression and the other case showed no hMLH1 protein expression. Three pathological germline mutations (2 in hMSH2 and 1 in hMLH1), which had not been reported previously, were identified. The same mutations were also found in other affected members of two HNPCC families, respectively. Conclusion: Typical Chinese HNPCC families showed relatively frequent germline mutation of mismatch repair genes. High-level microsatellite instability and loss of expression of mismatch repair genes correlated closely with germline mutation of mismatch repair genes. Microsatellite instability analysis and immunostaining of mismatch repair gene might serve as effective screening methods before direct DNA sequencing. It is necessary to establish clinical criteria and molecular diagnostic strategies more suitable for Chinese HNPCC families.

0036319338	Detection of SYT-SSX fusion transcripts in paraffin-embedded tissues of synovial sarcoma by revers transcription-polymerase chain reaction	Objective. To assess the feasibility of detecting SYT-SSX fusion transcripts in paraffin-embedded tissues of synovial sarcoma by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods. RT-PCR was used to amplify the SYT-SSX fusion transcripts using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from a series of 37 synovial sarcoma cases. To investigate the specificity of the SYT-SSX fusion transcripts, a variety of non-synovial sarcoma tumors were included in the study as negative controls. The detected messages derived from fusion genes were confirmed by subsequent sequence analysis. Results. SYT-SSX fusion transcripts were detected in 33 of 37 (89.2%) synovial sarcomas. None of the 34 cases of non-synovial sarcoma tumors showed amplified products of SYT-SSX fusion transcripts, although PBGD mRNA was detected in all specimens. Among 33 SYT-SSX-positive synovial sarcomas, 22 tumors had an SYT-SSX1 fusion transcript, whereas 6 tumors had an SYT-SSX2 fusion transcript. Fusion types can not be distinguished in the remaining 5 cases. There was a significant relationship between SYT-SSX fusion type and histologic subtype. All 10 biphasic synovial sarcomas had the SYT-SSX1 fusion, whereas all tumors with SYT-SSX2 were of monophasic morphology (P < 0.05). Conclusions. RT-PCR can be applied to archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues as a sensitive and reliable technique for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of synovial sarcoma. There is an association between SYT-SSX fusion type and histological subtype. SYT-SSX2 fusion transcripts can only be found in monophasic synovial sarcoma.

0036604183	ErbB2 overexpression correlates with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factors A, C, and D in human breast carcinoma	BACKGROUND. The angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A plays an important role in breast cancer progression. However, the involvement of VEGF-C and VEGF-D, two newer members of the VEGF family, in breast carcinoma and their relationship with clinicopathologic parameters have not been clearly demonstrated. METHODS. In this study, the expression levels of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D protein in 107 breast carcinoma cases and 22 nonmalignant breast tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitated by image analysis. RESULTS. Higher expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D was found in breast carcinomas than in nonmalignant breast tissue samples. Moreover, expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D was significantly and positively correlated with ErbB2 expression. High levels of VEGF-A expression were associated with shorter diseasefree survival (DFS). Patients with tumors expressing high levels of VEGF-C or VEGF-D showed a notable trend for worse DFS, however, it was not statistically significant. The combination of VEGF-A and VEGF-C status predicted survival better than either marker alone. CONCLUSIONS. Our study suggests that expression of the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors (i.e., VEGFs) might be regulated at least in part by ErbB2. In addition, the combination of VEGF-A and VEGF-C status may better predict prognosis of patients with breast carcinoma than VEGF-A alone. © 2002 American Cancer Society.

84855176062	Separation of normal and premalignant cervical epithelial cells using confocal light absorption and scattering spectroscopic microscopy Ex Vivo	Confocal light absorption and scattering spectroscopic (CLASS) microscopy can detect changes in biochemicals and the morphology of cells. It is therefore used to detect high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cells in the diagnosis of premalignant cervical lesions. Forty cervical samples from women with abnormal Pap smear test results were collected, and twenty cases were diagnosed as HSIL; the rest were normal or low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL). The enlarged and condensed nuclei of HSIL cells as viewed under CLASS microscopy were much brighter and bigger than those of non-HSIL cells. Cytological elastic scattered light data was then collected at wavelengths between 400 and 1000nm. Between 600nm to 800nm, the relative elastic scattered light intensity of HSIL cells was higher than that of the non-HSIL. Relative intensity peaks occurred at 700nm and 800nm. CLASS sensitivity and specificity results for HSIL and non-HSIL compared to cytology diagnoses were 80 and 90, respectively. This study demonstrated that CLASS microscopy could effectively detect cervical precancerous lesions. Further study will verify this conclusion before the method is used in clinic for early detection of cervical cancer. © 2011 Ling Yang et al.

8444253006	Cancer-specific activation of the survivin promoter and its potential use in gene therapy	Survivin is expressed in many cancers but not in normal adult tissues and is transcriptionally regulated. To test the feasibility of using the survivin promoter to induce cancer-specific transgene expression in lung cancer gene therapy, a vector expressing a luciferase gene driven by the survivin promoter was constructed and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. We found that the survivin promoter was generally more highly activated in cancer cell lines than in normal and immortalized normal cell lines. When delivered intravenously by DNA:liposome complexes, the survivin promoter was more than 200 times more cancer specific than the cytomegalovirus promoter in vivo. To identify lung cancer patients who may benefit from gene therapy with the survivin promoter, we measured survivin protein expression in surgical specimens of 75 non-small-cell lung cancers and 10 normal lung tissues by immunohistochemical staining and found that survivin is expressed in most of the non-small-cell lung cancers tested (81%, 61 of 75) but none of the normal lung tissues. The survivin promoter also induced transgene expression of a mutant Bik in cancer cells, which suppressed the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results indicate that the survivin promoter is a cancer-specific promoter for various cancers and that it may be useful in cancer gene therapy.

84859432225	Secretory breast carcinoma: A clinicopathological and immunophenotypic study of 15 cases with a review of the literature	Secretory breast carcinoma is a rare breast cancer with indolent clinical behavior. Recent research showed that secretory breast carcinoma belongs to the phenotypic spectrum of basal-like breast carcinomas. In this study, a clinicopathological and immunophenotypic analysis of secretory breast carcinomas from 15 Chinese patients was conducted. This patient group consisted of 2 males and 13 females, with ages ranging from 10 to 67 years old (median, 36 years old). All patients presented with a painless and firm mass. Tumor size ranged from 10 to 55 mm. Most tumors were located in the outer upper quadrant of the breast. Two patients (2 of 13, 15%) displayed positive axillary lymph nodes. At the microscopic level, the presence of intracellular and extracellular secretory material was the most remarkable feature. Most cases showed mild dysplasia cytologically. All cases were negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. The expression rate of the basal-like marker (CK5/6 or epidermal growth factor receptor) was 87% (13 of 15). The basal-like phenotype was identified in 13 cases (87%). Follow-up time ranged from 10 to 55 months (median, 19 months). None of the cases had evidence of recurrence and metastasis. Our study reveals that secretory breast carcinoma is a distinct subset of invasive breast carcinoma, with expression of basal-like markers. It should be noted that secretory breast carcinoma is different from conventional basal-like breast carcinomas. Future studies are required to further understand the prognostic significance of the basal-like markers expression in secretory breast carcinomas. © 2012 USCAP, Inc. All rights reserved.

84863136437	ALK-postive large B-cell lymphoma: Report of two cases and review of the literature	Anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive large B-cell lymphoma (ALK+ LBCL) is a rare variant of large B-cell lymphoma, but it rarely expresses B-lineage antigens (e.g CD20, CD79a) while showing an abnormal immunophenotype, such as positive for ALK, EMA, CD38, CD138. Only 55 cases of ALK+ LBCL have been reported so far in the published literature [1]. We present two additional cases of ALK+ LBCL, which were sent to our department for consultation from other hospitals. One was initially diagnosed as metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma and the other was not able to be diagnosed. The two cases were finally diagnosed as "ALK+ LBCL" at our department of pathology (see below). The chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) was given, respectively. Case 1 was given radiation therapy after chemotherapy, and case 2 wasn't. Case 1, followed up for 16 months, was free of disease. Case 2 died at 8 months after the diagnosis. Due to the abnormal immunophenotype and rareness, the diagnosis of ALK+ LBCL is often difficult, even being misdiagnosed as carcinoma or plasma cell neoplasm. However, the treatment for these diseases is quite different from each another. Avoiding misdiagnosis of ALK+ LBCL is of great clinic importance. In this report, we describe the clinical, morphological, immunohistiochemical and cytogenetic features of the two ALK+ LBCL cases, reviewed 55 published cases, and compared the features with those of literature-reported cases. We came to the conclusions: 1 ALK+ LBCL could affect non-adult and adult with a bimodal age distribution, with an average age of 12.5 years in the non-adult, and 43.5 years in the adult. 2 ALK+ LBCL is a potential diagnostic pitfall for pathologists. Its diagnosis clues are that neoplastic cells are immunoblastic or/and plasmacytoid with prominent central nucleoli, positive for ALK, EMA and some markers of late (plasma cell-like) B-cell differentiation, like CD138, VS38 and immunoglobulins, negative for B-cell markers like CD20 and CD79a. 3 The investigation of involved genetic abnormality (CLTC-ALK fusion, or NPM-ALK rearrangement) contributes to confirm ALK+ LBCL. 4 ALK+ LBCL has highly aggressive biobehavior and poor response to standard therapies. More patient case collection and prospective studies are needed. © 2011 Yu H, et al.

0037442154	Clinical characteristics and diagnosis of patients with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer	Aim: To study the clinical characteristics of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) in the Chinese population and discuss the identification and management of the patients with HNPCC. Methods: A series of 140 patients with colorectal cancers (CRC) and HNPCC associated tumors from 30 families fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria were analyzed. Results: A total of 118 patients had CRC. Average age at diagnosis of the first CRC was 45.7 years, 56.8 % and 23.4 % of the first CRC were located proximal to the splenic flexure and in the rectum respectively. Twenty-three (19.5 %) had synchronous and metachronous CRC. Twenty-seven patients were found to have extracolonic tumors. Gastric carcinoma was the most common tumor type in our series (44.4 %). Conclusion: The frequency of HNPCC was 2.6 % in our series of patients. The main features are an excess of early onset with a propensity to involve the proximal colon, and high frequency of multiple foci. Management and surveillance for these patients should be different from sporadic CRC. Contrary to American and European reports, gastric cancer seems more frequent than endometrial cancer in Chinese. It is necessary to formulate a new HNPCC criterion for Chinese patients.

0039303458	Clinicopathologic analysis of angiomyofibroblastoma of the female genital tract	Objective To study the clinicopathologic features and immunoprofile of angiomyofibroblastoma (AMF) with emphasis on differential diagnosis. Methods Seven vulvar, two vaginal and one perineal angiomyofibroblastomas were evaluated by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The immunohistochemical studies were performed on paraffin-embedded sections using the standard ABC method with a panel of antibodies. Results Angiomyofibroblastoma predominantly occurred in middle-aged women in the genital region, especially in the superficial area of the vulva. Clinically, most of the tumors presented as slowly growing painless masses and were often diagnosed as Bartholin's gland cysts. Histologically, the tumors were all well-circumscribed and characterized by alternating hypocellular and hypercellular areas with abundant thin-walled blood vessels. The tumor cells were bland and spindle-shaped or epithelioid and tended to concentrate around the vessels or cluster in small nests, Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells expressed vimentin and estrogen receptor protein in all 10 cases and desmin in 9 cases. Three cases showed weak or focal immunoreactivity to alpha-smooth muscle actin and muscle specific actin. All ten patients were treated by local excision. Follow-up showed a benign course with no signs of recurrence. Conclusions Angiomyofibroblastoma is a distinctive neoplasm that has a propensity to occur in the female genital tract. Recognition of this entity is important to avoid misdiagnosis with other vulvar angiomyxoid neoplasms.

84875012863	Utility of one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay in detecting breast cancer metastases of sentinel lymph nodes in a Chinese population	Background: The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay is an innovative method for the diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in breast cancer patients. The aim of the present study was to clinically validate the OSNA assay and compare its results with postoperative serial sectioning in a Chinese breast cancer population. Methods: A prospective study of 370 consecutive SLNs from 115 patients was conducted at our institution. A total of 311 SLNs underwent OSNA assay analysis. All SLNs were sectioned in approximately 2-mm pieces. OSNA assay and postoperative serial sectioning were performed on alternate divided node samples. The postoperative serial sectioning histology diagnosis was used as the standard. Results: The overall rate of agreement between OSNA assay and the postoperative serial sectioning was 95.2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 91.6-96.9 %], with a sensitivity of 83.3 % (95 % CI 66.5-93.0 %), a specificity of 96.7 % (95 % CI 93.7-98.4 %), a positive predictive value of 76.9 % (95 % CI 60.3-88.3 %), and a negative predictive value of 97.8 % (95 % CI 95.0-99.1 %) based on the number of SLNs sampled before the discordant cases analyses. Eleven out of 15 discordant cases can be explained by tissue allocation bias. Conclusions: Our study shows that the OSNA assay is more standardized, objective, and reproducible and can utilize more lymphoid tissue than the traditional pathological examination methods. OSNA can also distinguish between micrometastasis and macrometastasis, thereby enabling us to further study the significance of micrometastasis. Since there is a lack of standardization and reproducibility of pathological examination and diagnostic criteria of the SLNs, we recommend that the OSNA assay can be used in daily clinical diagnostic work. © 2013 The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.

84878499329	Identification of chromosomal copy number variations and novel candidate loci in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer with mismatch repair proficiency	The pathogenesis of microsatellite stable hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancers (MSS HNPCC) is unclear. To identify genomic regions that might be involved in MSS HNPCC pathogenesis, we selected 20 pairs of MSS HNPCC for a genome-wide study using copy number variation targeted (CNV-targeted) CytoScan HD Array. A remarkably increased frequency of 20q gain (70%) and high levels of copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (40%) were observed. The most frequent tumor-specific CNVs included amplifications (7p21.3-15.1, 8q13.3-24.3, 13q14.1-33.3 and 20q12-13.33) and deletions (8p11.23-23.1, 15q11.2-26.1, 17p13.1-13.3 and 18q11.2-21.33). In addition, 10 novel CNVs were discovered and led to identification of WDR16 and RAPGEF5 as candidate genes involved in tumorigenesis, displaying a robust correlation between expression and genomic alterations. Moreover, WDR16 and RAPGEF5 exhibited altered protein expression levels as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 41 other independent samples. Finally, high consistencies (68-84%) were observed between CNVs by Array and quantitative PCR. These findings are important for further elucidating MSS HNPCC pathogenesis. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

0041321048	Relationship between expression of CD44V6 in medullary thyroid carcinoma and its cervical lymph node metastasis	Purpose: To explore the relation between the expression of CD44V6 in medullary thyroid carcinoma and its cervical lymph node metastases. Methods: By immunohistochemical method, CD44V6 was detected in 36 MTC with LNM, 13 MTC, 21 FTC and 21 NT. Results: No expression was observed in normal thyroid tissues, positive expression was observed in MTC and FTC. But positive expression of CD44V6 in MTC with LNM was significantly higher than in MTC without LNM and FTC(P<0.05, P<0.01). Conclusions: Overexpression of CD44V6 in MTC, especially in MTC with LNM, is correlated with regional lymph node metastases, and it may promote lymph node metastases of medullary thyroid carcinoma.

0346874293	Simultaneously Examination of P53 and C-erbB-2 in Gastroscopic Stomach Tissues	Purpose: To investigate the expression of P53 and C-erbB-2 in gastroscopic Stomach Tissues for redounding to early clinical diagnosis and screening high risk population of gastric carcinomas. Methods: We examined simultaneously with immunohistochemical staining ABC in 15 normal mucosa, 16 mild, 15 moderate, 13 severe intestinal metaplasia tissues and 14 gastric carcinoma tissues. Results: Immunohistochemical positive specimens of P53 and C-erbB-2 found in gastric carcinoma tissues were 8/14(57.1%) and 7/14(50%) respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of immunohistochemical positive rate with double expression of C-erbB-2 and P53 were 28.6% and 100%, while that of Complex expression (C-erbB-2 and/or P53) were 84.6% and 88.1% respectively. Conclusions: C-erbB-2 can be used as a label in clinical diagnosis for gastric carcinoma because of the high specificity. Double expressin of C-erbB-2 and P53 can be used in early clinical diagnosis. Complex expression can be used to screen high risk population of gastric carcinomas.
