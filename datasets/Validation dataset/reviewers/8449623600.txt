1642375940	Rectal hypersensitivity reduced by acupoint TENS in patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: A pilot study	Our aim was to compare rectal perception of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C), functional constipation (FC), and healthy controls and to evaluate the therapeutic effect of acupoint transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS). Age- and sex-matched patients (24 IBS-D, 20 IBS-C, and 30 FC) were selected, and 30 volunteers served as healthy controls. Rectal sensory thresholds were evaluated by rectal balloon distension. Short- and long-term acupoint TENS was given respectively. IBS-D patients had significantly lower rectal sensory thresholds of the first sensation of stool, urgency of defecation, and pain than IBS-C or FC patients or healthy controls (P < 0.05), but there were no differences in rectal sensory thresholds among IBS-C and FC patients and healthy controls. In each group, females had significantly lower rectal sensory thresholds than males (P < 0.05), but there was no difference between younger (≤50 years old) and older (>50 years old) patients. Short-term acupoint TENS increased rectal sensory thresholds of IBS-D patients. After 2-month acupoint TENS treatment in IBS-D patients, rectal sensory thresholds were significantly increased, stool times and the intensity of abdominal pain were decreased, and psychological scores were relieved to normal. Lowered rectal perception threshold is a hallmark of IBS-D patients. Females have significantly lower rectal sensory thresholds than males. Acupoint TENS is effective to treat IBS-D.

20144376342	Comparison of three FOBT protocols for colorectal cancer screening in Chinese - A multicenter study	Objective: To evaluate three FOBT protocols of colorectal cancer screening. Methods: A multycenter study was conducted based on a consulted program. The effectiveness/cost of each protocole(CFOBT,IFOBT,SFOBT) were evaluated by the identifying patients who underwent CFOBT and IFOBT for 3 times consecutively as well as colonoscopy. Results: 323 eligible patients including 49 colorectal cancers, 60 colon adenomas, 60 chronic colitis, 15 hemorrhoids and 139 normal colon were observed. The effect/cost of CRC screening protocols was following:1). For 3 times of FOBT consecutively: There was no significant difference for their sensitivity among CFOBT,IFOBT and SFOBT(95.9%,95.9% &93.9%) but the specificity of IFOBT and SFOBT(89.21% and 94.24%) were higher significantly than CFOBT(75.54%). The specificity of SFOBT was higher than IFOBT. After adjusting their detecting number of cancer to same level the cost of SFOBT was the lowest. among these FOBTs. 2). For 2 times of FOBT consecutively: The sensitivity of CFOBT,IFOBT and SFOBT were 77.8%,87.8% and 75.5% respectively. The sensitivity of IFOBT was higher than SFOBT and CFOBT significantly. Their specificity were 88.5%, 96.4% and 98.6% respectively. The specificity of IFOBT and SFOBT were higher significantly than CFOBT. However, there was no significant difference for the specificity between IFOBT and SFOBT. After adjusting their detecting number of cancer to same level the cost of IFOBT was the lowest. among these FOBTs. 3). The detected rate of early colorectal cancer was 60% for all of 3 protocols. 4).41.6%-48.3% of adenomas was found by the 3 protocols, and 87.5% of adenomas over 2cm in diameter were detected by any one of FOBT. Conclusions: For the population with nice compliance 3 times of SFOBT will be recommended as a screening protocol of colorectal cancer. For that with poor compliance 2 times of IFOBT was recommended 3. The majority of adenomas in that advanced lesion existed might be detected by FOBT.

27644538157	Effect of Qianggu capsule on the effective range of motion of knee joint in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis	Aim: To observe the influence of Qianggu capsule on the effective range of motion of knee joint in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis, and compare the interventional effects with those of estrogen. Methods: Totally 120 postmenopausal women with primary osteoarthritis and had dysfunction at knee joint, who were treated or received physical examination in the endocrine clinic of Beijing Hospital of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 2001 to 2003, were selected in this study. Among them, 30 cases at 41 to 60 years of age, who did not accept experimental observation, were assigned into the control group, their menopausal time was 1 to 8 years, effective range of motion of knee joint was 60° to 95°; The other 90 cases, who were at 40 to 59 years at age, whose menopausal time was 1 to 7 years and effective range of motion of knee joint was 57° to 100°, were randomly divided into 3 groups: traditional Chinese medicine + estradiol group (n = 30), in which the patients were treated with traditional Chinese medicine Qianggu capsule combined with estradiol valerate; traditional Chinese medicine group (n = 30), the patients were treated only by traditional Chinese medicine Qianggu capsule; estradiol group (n = 30), the patients received only estradiol valerate, which was given by cyclic sequence. Before treatment and 12 weeks after treatment, the effective range of motion of lower limb's knee joint was measured with muscle evaluation system in each group. Results: According to intention-to-treat analysis, all the 120 cases finished the study. The effective range of motion of both lower limbs' knee joint in the traditional Chinese medicine + estradiol group, traditional Chinese medicine group and estradiol group was obviously raised significantly as compared with those before treatment by (30.13 ± 10.99)%, (18.99 ± 6.15)% and (19.31 ± 6.89)% respectively (t = -4.018, -3.165, -3.274, P < 0.01), and its increased range was obviously higher in the traditional Chinese medicine + estradiol group than in the traditional Chinese medicine group and estradiol group (t = 2.981, 2.712, P < 0.01), and it was slightly higher in the estradiol group than in the traditional Chinese medicine group (P > 0.05); The effective range of motion in the control group was obviously decreased by (9.67 ± 3.97)% as compared with that before treatment (t = 2.863, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Traditional Chinese medicine Qianggu capsule can ameliorate the effective range of motion knee joint in postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis. Its effect is similar to that of estradiol valerate, and the effect is better if they are used together.

28444457788	Portal vein thrombosis	Background: Most physicians in China may neglect portal vein thrombois (PVT) in clinical practice. In fact, portal vein thrombosis is an important cause of non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. As the diversity of its clinical manifestations, misdiagnosis is common if we don't bear PVT in mind during differential diagnosis. Therefore, we systematically reviewed PVT in terms of etiology, pathophysiology, pathology, clinical manifestations, and management. Data sources: An English-language literature search (from 1980 to 2004) was performed using Medline and Medscape, and articles closely related to PVT were selected. Results: PVT is the second cause of portal hypertension after liver cirrhosis in western countries. Liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, intra-abdominal infection, thrombophilic disorders including myeloproliferative diseases are strongly associated with the development of PVT. Liver transplantation is an emerging etiological factor of PVT with the development and wide use of this technique. Gastrointestinal bleeding resulted from esophageal varices, abdominal pain, splenomegaly and hypersplenism and ascites are common manifestations of PVT. However there are differences in etiological and clinical presentations between children and adults. Diagnosis of PVT depends on imaging-studies including Doppler ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and portography. Endoscopic therapy is recommended for variceal bleeding in PVT. Anticoagulant treatment for acute PVT is widely accepted in western countries. Conclusions: PVT may be unrecognized as the clinical manifestations are unspecific. Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment can lead to poor prognosis. Systematical collection of epidemiological and clinical data about PVT is necessary in China. © 2005, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int. All rights reserved.

33646427203	New immunochemical fecal occult blood test with two-consecutive stool sample testing is a cost-effective approach for colon cancer screening: Results of a prospective multicenter study in Chinese patients	The purpose of the study is to evaluate a new immunochemical fecal occult blood test method (Hemosure IFOBT), and compare it to the Guaiac-based chemical method (CFOBT) for colorectal cancer detection. A hypothetical sequential method (SFOBT), in which IFOBT was used only as a confirmatory test for CFOBT, was also evaluated. A total of 324 patients were recruited from 5 major hospitals in Beijing, China. For each patient, 3 consecutive stool samples were collected for simultaneous CFOBT and IFOBT tests, followed by colonoscopic examination. We compared the sensitivity and specificity of the 3 methods (CFOBT, IFOBT and SFOBT) in two settings, with the first 2 consecutive samples versus all 3 samples. Although the sensitivity for the detection of cancer and large (>20 mm) or multiple adenoma was similar for all 3 methods in the three-sample setting, in the two-sample setting IFOBT had higher sensitivity than SFOBT for detecting cancer (87.8% vs. 75.5%, respectively, p < 0.05) and large (>20 mm) or multiple adenomas (65.4% vs. 42.3%, respectively, p < 0.05). The IFOBT also had a higher specificity than the CFOBT (89.2% vs. 75.5%, respectively, p < 0.01) in "normal" individuals defined by colonoscopy in the three-sample setting. Comparing two-sample setting to the three-sample setting, both CFOBT and SFOBT showed significant loss of sensitivity for the detection of cancer as well as adenoma, whereas the sensitivity for IFOBT did not change significantly. Overall, IFOBT with two-sample testing showed compatible sensitivity and specificity to the three-sample testing, and had a lower relative cost per cancer detected than the three-sample testing. In conclusion, the new Hemosure IFOBT with two consecutive stool samples appears to be the most cost-effective approach for colon cancer screening. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33646704493	Effect of stealthy liposomal topotecan plus amlodipine on the multidrug-resistant leukaemia cells in vitro and xenograft in mice	Background: Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy as the over-expressed MDR protein acts as an efflux pump, which leads to a reduction in the uptake of the anticancer agent by tumour cells. We combined topotecan and amlodipine together into the stealthy liposomes, in which amlodipine was applied as a MDR reversing agent to overcome the resistance. Materials and methods: Cytotoxicity, apoptosis and the signalling pathway assays were performed on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562, promyelocytic leukaemia HL-60 and MDR HL-60 cells, respectively. Pharmacokinetics and antitumour activity studies were performed on normal Kunming mice and female BALB/c nude mice with MDR HL-60 xenografts, respectively. Results: Topotecan alone was effective in inhibiting the growth of non-resistant leukaemia cells, K562 and HL-60 cells but not the growth of MDR HL-60 cells. The resistance of topotecan in MDR HL-60 cells was potently reversed by the addition of amlodipine. Moreover, amlodipine enhanced the apoptosis-inducing effect of topotecan synergistically. Apoptosis was through activating caspases in a cascade: first, the initiator caspase 8 and then effectors caspase 3/7 (total activity of caspases 3 and 7) were activated. Being encapsulated into the stealthy liposmes with an acidic internal medium, topotecan existed dominantly in an active lactone species, which was reversibly changed from an inactive carboxylate form via a pH-dependent reaction. After administration of stealthy liposomes to mice, the blood exposure of the lactone form was evidently increased and extended. The antitumour effects in the MDR HL-60 xenografted tumour were stealthy liposomal topotecan (SLT) plus amlodipine > SLT > un-encapsulated topotecan > blank control. Conclusions: The enhanced antitumour activity in the MDR HL-60 cells by the SLT plus amlodipine could be owing to multiple reasons: (a) synergistic apoptosis inducing effect, (b) reversing MDR by amlodipine and (c) increasing the availability of active lactone of topotecan by the stealthy liposomes. The apoptosis induced by amlodipine is through caspase 8 and then the 3/7 signalling pathway. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

33747123919	Effect of supplementing 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid and DL-methionine in corn-soybean-cottonseed meal diets on growth performance and carcass quality of broilers	This experiment was conducted to compare the effects of feeding DL-2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMTBA) and DL-methionine (DLM) supplemented corn-soybean-cottonseed meal diets on growth performance, carcass composition, and muscle color of broilers. The trial was designed as a 2x3x2 factorial experiment, including two methionine (Met) sources (HMTBA and DLM), three equimolar graded levels of Met supplementation (i.e., 0.08, 0.16, and 0.24% in the starter diet and 0.07, 0.14, and 0.21% in the grower and finisher diets, respectively), and two sexes (male and female). Additionally, one basal diet for each sex was formulated to be limiting in Met to test the dosage response of increasing supplemental Met levels. Four hundred and twenty 10-d-old broilers were randomly allotted to 14 treatments (seven each for males and females), with five replicate pens per treatment and six chicks per pen. There was no difference (p>0.05) between the two Met sources in growth performance and muscle deposition of broilers throughout the whole experimental period (d 10 to 49). With the increasing Met supplementation levels, average daily gain was increased (quadratic; p<0.01) during the starter, grower, and overall phases, average daily feed intake was increased (quadratic; p<0.01) during the starter phase, and feed:gain ratio was decreased (quadratic; p<0.05) during the grower and overall phases. At the end of finisher phase, Met supplementation increased breast muscle content (quadratic; p<0.01) and thigh muscle content (linear; p<0.05), and decreased abdominal fat content (quadratic; p<0.02). Compared to the broiler fed DLM, broilers fed HMTBA had superior breast and thigh muscle coloration (p<0.01). Male broilers had higher weight gain and feed intake and better feed conversion than female broilers (p<0.01). The fat content of thigh muscle in female broilers was higher than that of male broilers (p<0.03). The best fit comparison of HMTBA vs. DLM was determined by Schwarz Bayesian Criteria index, which indicated that the average relative bioefficacy of HMTBA vs. DLM was 120% with 95% confidence limit 67 to 172%. These results indicated that Met supplementation improved growth performance and carcass quality of broilers fed corn-soybean-cottonseed meal diets irrespective of Met sources. Compared to DLM, HMTBA has the same molar bioefficacy on improving the growth performance and carcass quality of broilers; however, HMTBA fed birds had superior meat color to DLM fed birds.

33749863025	Effects of lactitol and tributyrin on growth performance, small intestinal morphology and enzyme activity in weaned pigs	One hundred and sixty crossbred pigs (6.62±0.36 kg) weaned at day 18±1 were used to investigate the effects of lactitol and tributyrin on performance, small intestinal morphology and enzyme activity. The pigs were assigned to one of five dietary groups (4 pens/diet with 8 pigs/pen) and were fed the negative control diet or the negative control diet supplemented with 10 g/kg glutamine (as a positive control), or 3 g/kg lactitol (β-D- galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-sorbitol), or 5 g/kg tributyrin (butanoic acid 1,2,3-propanetriyl ester), or 3 g/kg lactitol+5 g/kg tributyrin. Body weight and feed intake were measured weekly during the 4-week study. On day 7, four pigs per dietary treatment were sacrificed to examine small intestinal morphology and enzyme activity. The results showed that: (1) Compared with the negative control diet, the positive control diet improved weight gain and feed efficiency during weeks 1-2 and over the entire study (p<0.05), and also decreased duodenal and ileal crypt depth (p<0.05), but did not alter intestinal enzyme activity (p>0.05). Lactitol improved feed efficiency during weeks 3-4 and over the entire study (p<0.05), but did not improve weight gain and feed intake, intestinal morphology or enzyme activity (p>0.05). Tributyrin improved weight gain and reduced feed/gain during weeks 3-4 and over the entire study. Tributyrin significantly decreased crypt depth in the duodenum and ileum, and increased duodenal lactase and ileal maltase activity (p<0.05). Lactitol+tributyrin increased weight gain during weeks 3-4 and over the entire study, and improved feed efficiency during weeks 1-2 and 3-4 and over the entire study (p<0.05). Lactitol+tributyrin increased the jejunal villus height, and decreased the duodenal and ileal crypt depth (p<0.05). Lactitol+tributyrin also increased jejunal lactase and sucrase activity (p<0.05). (2) Compared with the positive control, tributyrin improved weight gain and reduced feed/gain during weeks 3-4 (p<0.05), decreased the ileal crypt depth, and improved the duodenal lactase and sucrase activity (p<0.05). Lactitol+ tributyrin improved weight gain during weeks 3-4, improved feed efficiency during weeks 3-4 and over the entire study, increased the ileal villus height, and increased jejunal lactase, sucrase and maltase activity (p<0.05). These results showed that tributyrin improved performance, intestinal morphology and enzyme activity, while the effect of lactitol was very limited. These results also showed that, compared with glutamine. tributyrin was more effective in improving intestinal morphology and enzyme activity, and tributyrin exerted a superior effect in improving performance as weaning progressed. These observations suggest that, as a chemical for repairing intestinal atrophy, glutamine and tributyrin should be used in the first and second periods of the starter phase, respectively.

33846826862	Continuous micro flow synthesis of ZnO nanorods with UV emissions	In this paper, a new process was presented to synthesize ZnO nanorods with diameter less than 10 nm. By using polytetrafluoroethylene capillary tube as micro flow reactor, ZnO nanorods could be controllably synthesized by changing the flow rates of pumped stock solutions. The effects of flow rates on the structures of as-synthesized ZnO were investigated. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images demonstrated that longer and thicker ZnO nanorods could be synthesized with slow flow rate. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra with UV emissions were also observed. For ZnO nanorods synthesized with slow flow rate, its corresponding UV emission would shift to low energy. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33846944293	Inhibition of PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF)/granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) decreased cell proliferation and invasion through downregulation of cyclin D and CDK 4 and inactivation of MMP-2	Background: PC cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF), also called epithelin/ granulin precursor (GEP), is an 88-kDa secreted glycoprotein with the ability to stimulate cell proliferation in an autocrine fashion. In addition, some studies indicated that PCDGF participated in invasion, metastasis and survival of cancer cells by regulating cell migration, adhesion and proliferation. Yet the effects of PCDGF on proliferation and invasion of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and the mechanisms by which PCDGF mediates biological behaviors of ovarian cancer have rarely been reported. In the present study we investigated whether and how PCDGF/GEP mediated cell proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer. Methods: PCDGF/GEP expression level in three human ovarian cancer cell lines of different invasion potential were detected by RT-PCR and western blot. Effects of inhibition of PCDGF expression on cell proliferation and invasion capability were determined by MTT assay and Boyden chamber assay. Expression levels of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and MMP-2 activity were evaluated in a pilot study. Results: PCDGF mRNA and protein were expressed at a high level in SW626 and A2780 and at a low level in SKOV3. PCDGF expression level correlated well with malignant phenotype including proliferation and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. In addition, the proliferation rate and invasion index decreased after inhibition of PCDGF expression by antisense PCDGF cDNA transfection in SW626 and A2780. Furthermore expression of CyclinD1 and CDK4 were downregulated and MMP-2 was inactivated after PCDGF inhibition in the pilot study. Conclusion: PCDGF played an important role in stimulating proliferation and promoting invasion in ovarian cancer. Inhibition of PCDGF decreased proliferation and invasion capability through downregulation of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and inactivation of MMP-2. PCDGF could serve as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. © 2007 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0033171553	cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of hepatitis G virus genome isolated from a Chinese blood donor	Objective To obtain full-length sequence of a Chinese hepatitis G virus (HGV) strain (HGVch) and investigate the genetic characteristic of HGVch and its identity to other isolates. Methods Reverse transcription (RT) and nested-PCR were used to screen HGV RNA positive serum and amplify cDNA fragments. A positive serum without known hepatitis virus markers was selected for isolating HGV RNA template. The HGV genome was divided into 12 overlapping fragments and directly cloned into pGEM-T vector. Sequences were determined by dideoxy terminus-end method of DNA sequencing and then analyzed by computer. Results The twelve fragments of HGVch cover 9213 nucleotides in length, containing a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding 2873 animo acids polyprotein that began with a methonine residue and ended at termination codon. HGVch is about 86.5% - 89.5% identical to other known HGV isolates at the nucleotide level and about 93.9% - 96.2% at the deduced animo acid level. Conclusion HGV is a non-A-E hepatitis causal agent, proved to be related with posttransfusion hepatitis in all over the world. Chinese HGV isolate has very close relationship to other isolates from Africa, Europe, Japan, without significant difference across the entire genome. It is suggested that the sequences of HGV isolates are very conservative and the evolution is very slow.

Methods BPs were labeled in tymidine (T) position under ultraviolet lamp. The method was compared with indirect RT-in situ PCR and in situ hybridization for detecting hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. Results Serum HCV PCR and southern blot showed that BP labeling psimer PCR was possible, and had a good specificity. The HCV positive rate was 53% (16/ 30) by indirect in situ PCR, 50% (15/30) positive specimens were found by BP labeling primer in situ PCR. Statistical analysis revealed P ≥ 0.05 and the two methods had no dominant differences. Meanwhile, only 23% (7/30) positive signals were seen by in situ hybridization, which was lower than two in situ PCR( P ≤0.05). HCV was mainly located in hepatic-plasmas, and positive signals were found in monocytes and cholangiolar epithelia. Conclusions Both indirect in situ PCR and BP labeling in situ PCR have good sensitivity and specificity for detecting HCV RNA of liver tissues. HCV RNA is located in hepatocytes, monocytes and cholangiolar epithelia.

38749103854	Therapeutic effects of mucosal tolerance on inflammatory bowel disease: Experiment with rats	Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of mucosal tolerance on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods: Forty-two SD rats underwent enema of 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS) so as to establish models of experimental colitis and then divided into 7 equal groups: colitis group (without treatment), oral ovalbumin (OVA) group (undergoing gastric perfusion of OVA as inducing antigen), nasal OVA group (undergoing OVA nose dropping), oral OVA plus adjuvant group [undergoing gastric perfusion OVA with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as adjuvant], nasal OVA plus adjuvant group, adjuvant control group, and blank control group (administrated with PBS orally). Another 6 rats were used as blank control group. All of the rats were executed 21 days after enema with their spleens taken out. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated and co-cultured with OVA for 96 h. MTT method was used to calculate the proliferation index so as to detect the mucosal tolerance. Macroscopical and histolopathological scores of colon were estimated so as to evaluate the therapeutic effects. Results: Typical manifestations of colitis occurred 3-4 days after enema and persisted to the day 21 after enema. The macroscopical and histolopathological scores of colon of the colitis group (mean rank were 9.5 and 9.5) were both significantly higher than those of the normal control group (mean rank were 3.5 and 3.5 both P < 0.01). The splenic lymphocyte proliferation indexes of the oral OVA plus LPS, nasal OVA, and nasal OVA plus LPS groups were 0.11 ± 0.05, 0.12 ± 0.07, and 0.06 ± 0.04 respectively, all significantly lower than that of the normal control group (0.30 ± 0.13, all P < 0.05), however, without significant differences among these 3 groups (all P > 0.05). The splenic lymphocyte proliferation indexes of the oral OVA group was 0.25 ± 0.10, not significantly different from that of the normal control group (P > 0.05). The macroscopical scores of the oral OVA plus LPS group, nasal OVA plus LPS group, and oral LPS alone group were 3.0 ± 1.3, 2.0 ± 0.6, and 4.3 ± 1.0 respectively, all significantly lower than that of the colitis group (6.3 ± 0.8, all P < 0. 05); and the histological score of the oral OVA plus LPS group, nasal OVA plus LPS group, and oral LPS alone group were 3.0 ± 1.1, 2.7 ± 1.0, and 4.6 ± 1.6 respectively, all significantly lower than that of the colitis group (7.5 ± 1.0, all P < 0.05). The colonic score of the nasal OVA plus LPS group was most significantly decreased. Conclusion: Colitis interferes with the induction of oral tolerance, but not the induction of nasal tolerance. Both oral tolerance combined with adjuvant and nasal tolerance combined with adjuvant have therapeutic effects on experimental colitis. Oral adjuvant alone also has therapeutic effect on colitis, and the therapeutic effect of nasal tolerance combined with adjuvant is the best.

39649086084	Effect of rhVEGF gene transfection on survival of grafts after autologous free granular fat transplantation in rats	Objective: To investigate the effect of recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) on autologous free granular fat grafts in rats. Methods: Forty-eight Sprague Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 190-280 g and regardless sex, were randomly divided into three groups, sixteen in each. After fat transplantation, the rats were treated with plasmid DNA encoding rhVEGF protein (the experimental group), plasmid DNA (the negative group) and normal saline (the blank control group) , respectively. At 3, 7, 15 and 30 days after transplantation, the rats were killed and the grafts were weighed, respectively. Histopathological changes were evaluated. Microvessel density and the expression of VEGF were examined by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. Results: The weights of the negative and blank control groups were significantly reduced on the 7th, 15th and 30th days compared with those of the experimental group. The expression of VEGF and the microvessel density in the experimental group were significantly higher than the other two groups during the latter periods. Conclusion: The plasmid encoding VEGF can induce expression of VEGF and angiogenesis in fat grafts and reduce the absorption of free fat grafts.

No difference was observed between the two Met sources in growth performance and muscle deposition from 10 to 49 d. With increasing Met levels, average daily gain was increased in the starter, grower and overall phases, average daily feed intake was increased in the starter phase, and feed:gain ratio was decreased in the grower and overall phases. Met supplementation increased breast muscle content and decreased abdominal fat content. Broilers given HMTBA had breast and thigh muscle coloration that was characterised as superior to those fed DLM. These results indicated that Met supplementation improved growth performance and carcase quality irrespective of the Met sources. Compared to DLM, HMTBA has the same molar bioefficacy for improving the growth performance and carcase quality; however, HMTBA-fed birds had superior meat colour to DLM-fed birds. © 2007 British Poultry Science Ltd.

40849085361	Establishment of standard positive control and PCR detection system for Bursaphelenchus xylophilus	A pair of primer sets cqubs01/cquba01 was selected from the primers which were designed based on the specific gene sequences rDNA-ITS and BxPe12 of the pine wood nematode (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). After optimization, a stable, sensitive (The detection limition was 100 pg/μL with the genome DNA of B. xylophilus as template) and specific PCR detection method was established. Using the specific primers, the 196 bp amplified fragments, which were not homologous with any nematodes but B. xylophilus, were obtained and purified. The product was then ligated with the pMD18-T vector and transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. The selected positive clones were sequenced and those validated were used as a harmless positive control. Nearly 100 samples of 12 batches collected from different areas were detected with this PCR system and the anticipated results were obtained.

77954771935	Signal transduction pathway of colonic toll-like receptor 4 in patients with irritable bowel syndrome	Objective: To study the expression of TLR4, myeloid differential protein 2 (MD-2), and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the colonic mucosa with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in patients and to explore the role of TLR4 in the pathogenesis of IBS and TLR4 signal transduction pathway. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of TLR4, MD-2, and NF-κB in the colon mucosa specimens of 30 patients with diarrhea-predominant, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) and 12 healthy volunteers obtained by colonoscopy. Results: The A value of TLR4 in the IBS specimens was (0.40 ± 0.10), significantly higher than that of the specimens from the controls [(0.30 ± 0.05), P = 0.001]. MD-2 expression was not seen in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) of 10 healthy controls and was lowly expressed in the sigmoid mucosa of 2 of the 12 healthy controls; and was lowly expressed in 4 of the IBS patients and not expressed in 26 of the 30 IBS patients. The mean number of MD-2 positive cells in the IBS patients was 2.26 (0.80-4.73)/view field, significantly higher than that of the healthy controls [0.90 (0.56-1.33) /view field, P = 0.003]. The positive rate of NF-κB of the IBS patients was 83.33%, significantly higher than that of the healthy controls (P = 0.02) and the NF-κB intensity of the IBS patients of the A value was (0.31 ± 0.04), significantly higher than that of the healthy controls [(0.25 ± 0.04), P = 0.003]. Conclusion: Up-regulation of TLR4 in IBS patients may contribute to occurrence of IBS. There exists the activation of the signal transduction pathway of NF-κB in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients, which suggested that inflammation participates in pathogenesis of IBS. The low and negative expression of MD-2 may contribute to the tolerance with the intestinal commensal bacteria.

77954802237	Diagnostic value of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in patients with ulcerative colitis: A meta-analysis	Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic value of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: Articles related to diagnosis of UC by ANCA test, published before November 2007, were retrieved in the databanks such as Chinese BioMedical Disc, Chinese Medical Current Contents, China National Knowledge Intrastructurre, and VIP databank. Related journals were searched manually. Meta-analysis was performed by summary receiver operating characteristic curve recommended by Diagnostic and Screening Group of the Cochrane Collaboration Web with the parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, predictive values and likelihood ratio. Results: Totally 10 studies including 381 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of ANCA to the diagnosis of UC were 52.2% and 99.0% respectively. The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were 98.0% and 68.7% respectively. Meanwhile, the positive and negative likelihood ratio (+ LR and - LR) were 52.2 and 0.5, respectively. Conclusions: ANCA is an immunological index related to UC. Positive ANCA helps diagnose UC, but is not sensible enough to screen UC.

84861790649	Probiotics and colorectal tumorigenesis	Gut microbiota impacts human health profoundly and it is demonstrated that a composition change in microbiota could be associated with various disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Intake of probiotic formulations is a popular approach to modulate the microbiome and its functions. In fact, there is growing evidence that probiotics supplement is a potential approach to prevent and treat colorectal neoplasms, and the antitumor effect might be attributed to multifactorial mechanisms, including modulation of intestinal mucosal immune responses and inflammation, inhibition of colonization and reproduction of pathogenic bacteria, restoration of intestinal epithelial barrier function, inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, repression of carcinogenic chemicals, increase of antioxidant potential, etc. We summarized the relationship between probiotics and colorectal tumorigenesis in this review article.

84877750156	Effect of l-arginine on intestinal mucosal immune barrier function in weaned pigs after Escherichia coli LPS challenge	The effects of l-arginine (Arg) supplementation on intestinal mucosal immune barrier function in weaned pigs after Escherichia coli LPS challenge were evaluated. Twenty-four weaned pigs were allotted to four treatments including: (i) non-challenged control; (ii) LPS-challenged control; (iii) LPS + 0.5% Arg; and (iv) LPS + 1.0% Arg. On d 16, pigs in the LPS, LPS + 0.5% Arg and LPS + 1.0% Arg groups were challenged by injection with 100 μg/kg of body mass LPS, whereas the control group were given sterile saline. At 48 h post-challenge, all pigs were sacrificed for evaluation of small intestinal morphology and mucosal immune barrier function. In the jejunum and ileum, LPS caused villous atrophy and intestinal morphology disruption, whereas 0.5% or 1.0% Arg supplementation mitigated villus atrophy and intestinal morphology impairment caused by LPS challenge. Arg (0.5%) supplementation increased the numbers of IgA-secreting cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the ileum (P < 0.05). Arg supplementation prevented the elevation of mast cell numbers induced by LPS challenge (P < 0.05). Dietary supplementation of Arg caused a decreased lymphocyte apoptosis of Peyer's patches in pigs challenged by LPS (P < 0.05). These results indicated that Arg supplementation protects and enhances intestinal mucosal immune barrier function and maintains intestinal integrity in weaned pigs after E. coli LPS challenge. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

43249129399	Rice protein concentrate partially replaces dried whey in the diet for early-weaned piglets and improves their growth performance	BACKGROUND: Recently, rice protein concentrate (RPC), a much cheaper source of dietary protein, has become commercially available for use in the feed industry. Importantly, dietary supplementation with RPC can increase feed intake by early-weaned pigs. The objective of this study was to determine whether RPC can replace milk protein in the diet for early-weaned pigs. RESULTS: Neither average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), nor the feed/gain ratio differed among the treatment groups in weeks 1 and 2. In week 3, the addition of 5 or 10% RPC to diets increased (P < 0.05) ADFI and ADG of pigs compared to those in the control group fed a 60% dried whey diet. During the entire 21-day trial, ADFI and ADG were greater (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the 5 and 10% RCP diets than in pigs fed the 60% dried whey and 15% RCP diets. There were no differences in the serum concentrations of growth hormone on days 14 and 21, serum concentrations of insulin growth factor-I (IGF-I) on day 14, or IGF-I gene expression in liver and skeletal muscle on days 14 and 21 among the dietary treatments. Serum concentrations of IGF-I in pigs fed the 5, 10 and 15% RPC diets were greater than those in pigs fed the 60% dried whey diet. CONCLUSION: Findings indicate that up to 10% RPC can be used to replace dried whey in the diet for 7- to 21-day-old weaned piglets and can improve their growth performance. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry.

42049116729	Comparison of esophageal motility between patients with endoscope-positive gastroesophageal reflux disease with normal pH and those with abnormal pH	AIM: To compare the esophageal motility between patients with normal pH endoscope-positive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and abnormal pH endoscope-positive GERD. METHODS: There were 49 patients with endoscope-positive gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Patients were divided into normal and abnormal pH groups, according to the DeMeester score. Thirty-seven patients were in the abnormal pH group (27 males, 10 females, mean age 56 ± 15 yr), and the remainder were in the normal pH group (8 males, 4 females, mean age 51 ± 11 yr). Eight patients in the abnormal group suffered from hiatus hernia at the same time. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups in age and sex rate. The mean lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) and the mean peristalsis amplitude in the middle-down esophagus body and anal lateral esophagus body in the normal pH group were higher than those in the abnormal group (P = 0.036, P = 0.048, P = 0.017). When we analyzed patients with hiatus hernia, the mean peristalsis amplitude of the anal lateral esophagus was higher in the normal pH group than that in the abnormal group (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: The mean LESP and peristalsis amplitude of middle-down esophagus body and anal lateral esophagus body in the normal pH group were higher than those in the abnormal group. Even when patients with hiatus hernia were not included, the results were close to the whole analysis. This shows why some patients with endoscope-positive gastroesophageal reflux disease appear normal pH profile. Stronger clearance ability of esophagus and barrier in the normal pH monitoring group may contribute to the phenomena.

44449119097	Concurrent inflammatory bowel disease and myelodysplastic syndrome: Report of nine new cases and a review of the literature	Nine patients with concurrent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were examined. Median age at diagnosis of these patients was similar to the usual age of patients at diagnosis of IBD only. There was a strong predominance of Crohn's disease (seven of nine cases), with an unusually high frequency of colorectal involvement (five of nine cases). Inflammatory bowel disease was diagnosed first in one patient, MDS first in five patients, and both diseases were diagnosed simultaneously in three patients. All patients had moderate or severe anemia. The prognosis of IBD was determined by MDS. These observations suggest that there is an unclear common pathogenesis of IBD and MDS and, consequently that patients with IBD and anemia of non-obvious origin should be evaluated for the presence of MDS. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

44249120525	Increased expression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in the immune system of weaned pigs after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide injection	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, has been implicated in regulation of immunity and inflammation in rodents and humans. The objective of the current study was to investigate whether the expression of PPARγ was altered in the immune system of weaned pigs after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. PPARγ expression was investigated in the thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph node and peripheral white blood cells of weaned pigs (8.54 ± 0.24 kg BW) after LPS injection (100 μg/kg BW, n = 6) and controls (sterile saline, n = 6), by using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines and hormones were also assessed. LPS triggered PPARγ mRNA and protein expression in the thymus (P < 0.05, 4.24-fold; P < 0.10, 1.46-fold), spleen (P < 0.10, 2.75-fold; P < 0.05, 1.84-fold), mesenteric lymph node (P < 0.05, 4.32-fold; P < 0.05, 1.96-fold) and peripheral white blood cells (P < 0.001, 24.44-fold; P < 0.001, 1.58-fold). The LPS-injected pigs showed an increase in PPARγ staining in splenic corpuscle and periarterial lymphatic sheath of white pulp (P < 0.05) and red pulp (P < 0.001) of spleen, and in medullas of thymus lobule of thymus (P < 0.05), and in thymus-dependent area of mesenteric lymph node (P < 0.05) compared to the control pigs. Concurrent with up-regulation of PPARγ expression, LPS induced increases in plasma interleukin-6 (P < 0.001), tumor necrosis factor-α (P < 0.001), cortisol (P < 0.001), prostaglandin E

47249090100	Chondrogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in alginate microspheres	Background: Conventionally, the stem cells are induced to differentiate into chondrocytes in vitro by means of high-density cell aggregation culture or plane culture. But the cell aggregation is prone to damage the cell activity, and plane culture is limited in the number of harvesting cells. Objective: To investigate the differentiation potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to chondrocytes in alginate microspheres, and observe the growth of chondrocytes on chitosan composite scaffolds. Design, Time and Setting: An observation study was carried out in the Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of the State Education Bureau, School of Stomatology, Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei, China) from March to October in 2007. Materials: Seven Wistar rats of SPF grade and one month old were used in this study. Chitosan composite scaffolds were provided by College of Resource and Environment in Wuhan University (China). Transforming growth factor (TGF) β 3 and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I were the products of Sigma Company (USA). Methods: Bone marrow was harvested from rat femur and tibia, and then were amplified to culture MSCs in vitro. MSCs capsulated in alginate microspheres were induced by TGF-β 3 and IGF-I, serving as the experiment group, While those cultured without TGF- β 3 and IGF-I were taken as controls. Three weeks later, the expressions of collagen type II and Aggrecan were evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. After the induced chondrocytes were seeded on the chitosan composite scaffolds, their morphology was evaluated by scanning electron microscope. Main Outcome Measures: The expressions of collagen type II and aggrecan, together with the morphology of chondrocytes were all observed. Results: The MSCs capsulated in alginate microspheres were induced to express the higher levels of collagen type II and aggrecan by TGF- β 3 and IGF-I than those without any growth factor (P < 0.05). No significant differences were found in the experiment group compared to the primarily cultured chondrocytes (P > 0.05). The chitosan composite scaffolds supported the adhesion, proliferation and migration of the induced chondrocytes, which exhibited typical growth of chondrocytes. Conclusion: Combination TGF- β 3 with IGF-I can induce the MSCs capsulated in alginate microspheres to differentiate into chondrocytes, and chitosan-based scaffold is biocompatible with the induced chondrocytes.

48249148619	Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori resistance to antibiotics and its influence on the treatment outcome in China: A multicenter clinical study	Background: The increase in resistance to antibiotics emerged as a significant clinical problem seems to result in a decrease in the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy in recent years. The information about H. pylori resistance status to antibiotics in China has not been very clear, but is important for improving the efficacy by establishing a reasonable first-line therapy. Aims: To investigate the prevalence of H. pylori resistance to metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin in China and to evaluate the effect of H. pylori resistance to antibiotics on the cure rates of anti-H. pylori 7-day triple therapies. Methods: Sixteen medical centers joined this multicenter randomized trial. Nine hundreds and ten H. pylori infected patients with upper abdominal symptoms referred for gastroendoscopy were enrolled. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: Group LCA (lansoprazole 30 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, amoxicillin 1000 mg bid, for 7days) and Group LCM (lansoprazole 30 mg bid, clarithromycin 500 mg bid, metronidazole 400 mg bid, for 7 days). H. pylori was cultured from gastric biopsy specimens and the isolated strains were tested for metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin resistance by E-test. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≥8 mg/L for metronidazole, ≥2 mg/L for clarithromycin and ≥1 mg/L for amoxicillin were considered resistant. Results: The per protocol (PP) eradication rates of H. pylori were 82.7% for LCA group and 68.6% for LCM group (P<0.001), respectively. H. pylori strains were cultured from gastric biopsy specimens obtained from 340 patients among the 910 patients. The resistance rates were 75.6% for metronidazole, 27.6% for clarithromycin and 2.7% for amoxicillin. In group LCM, the PP eradication rates in patients with strains sensitive to both metronidazole and clarithromycin, and strains resistant to both metronidazole and clarithromycin were 84.4% and 42.1% (P<0.001), respectively. The PP eradication rates in patients with strains sensitive to clarithromycin and resistant to clarithromycin in group LCA were 91.6% and 58.1% (P<0.001), respectively. Conclusions: The resistance rates of H. pylori to metronidazole and clarithromycin are high and the resistance rate to amoxicillin is relatively low in China. It suggests that resistance to metronidazole and clarithromycin is the main cause of failure of eradication therapy for H. pylori infection.

We explored the role of colonoscopy in the diagnosis of GI-GVHD and CMV enteritis following allo-HSCT to identify the endoscopic manifestations of GI-GVHD and CMV enteritis was made. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the colonoscopic manifestations of GI-GVHD, CMV enteritis and GI-GVHD with concurrent CMV enteritis (GconC) and their related clinical issues. Results: Forty-seven patients underwent 50 colonoscopies with diagnoses of 32 GI-GVHD, 7 CMV enteritis and 11 GconC. Both GI-GVHD and CMV enteritis had colonic mucosal lesions with various manifestations under colonoscopy. Tortoise shell like changes of the mucosa (12 of 32) and deep ulcers (2 of 7) were specific endoscopic manifestations for GI-GVHD and CMV enteritis, respectively, while mucosal oedema, erythema, congestion, erosion and shallow ulcers could not be used to differentiate GI-GVHD from CMV enteritis. GconC patients were prone to have oozing bleeding of the end ileal mucosa and typhlodicliditis. Of the biopsed specimens for GI-GVHD, CMV enteritis and GconC, 64%, 70% and 44% were taken from the rectum and sigmoid colon respectively. Conclusions: Following allo-HSCT, tortoise shell like changes and deep ulcers of the colonic mucosa are characteristic changes for GI-GVHD and CMV enteritis, respectively, while the other lesions are not. Most of the GI-GVHDs and CMV enteritis cases can be diagnosed by left colon examination and tissue biopsy, but total colon examination to the terminal ileum is preferred.

50549104146	Effects of vibration therapy on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis	Background: Jaw osteonecrosis possibly associated with the administration of bisphosphonates is expected to be treated with a non-pharmacologic approach. This study aimed to determine whether noninvasive, mechanically mediated vibration would inhibit the decline in bone mineral density (BMD) that follows menopause, enhance the BMD of the lumbar and femoral neck, and reduce chronic back pain in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods: A total of 116 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis participated in this study, and they were divided into groups A (66 patients) and B (50). Group A received vibration treatment (Subjects vertically stand on the vibration platform, with a vibration frequency of 30 Hz, amplitude of 5 mm; they received the treatment five times per week, ten minutes each time and totally for six months), whereas women of group B served as controls without any treatment. L2-4 BMD, bilateral femoral neck BMD, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded before the treatment or at the third and sixth months of the treatment respectively. After the ending of the treatment, the change of BMD in each group was compared and analyzed. Chronic back pain was evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS) at baseline and the third and sixth months of the treatment. Results: Of the 116 women, 94 including 51 women from group A ((61.23±8.20) years) and 43 women from group B ((63.73±5.45) years), completed the study. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics including age, BMI, menopausal years, lumbar BMD, femoral neck BMD, and VAS between the two groups. The lumbar BMD of the 51 women in group A increased by 1.3% (P=0.034) after vibration treatment for 3 months and by 4.3% at the sixth month (P=0.000). The lumbar BMD in group B was decreased at the third month, but there was not statistical significance (P>0.05). At the sixth month, it was decreased by 1.9% (P <0.05). The femoral neck BMD of the 51 women in group A was slightly increased after vibration treatment for 3 months, but without statistical significance (P >0.05). At the sixth month, the BMD was increased by 3.2% (P <0.05). In group B, the BMD was not decreased significantly (P=0.185) at the third month, but decreased significantly at the sixth month (1.7%) (P <0.05) compared with the baseline. Chronic back pain (VAS) reduced more significantly in group A at the third and the sixth months (P <0.05) after vibration therapy in comparison with the baseline. The BMI was not significantly changed in the two groups during the period of follow-up. Conclusions: Vibration therapy appears to be useful in reducing chronic back pain and increasing the femoral neck and lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

49649100463	Dietary arginine supplementation alleviates intestinal mucosal disruption induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in weaned pigs	This study evaluated whether arginine (Arg) supplementation could attenuate gut injury induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge through an anti-inflammatory role in weaned pigs. Pigs were allotted to four treatments including: (1) non-challenged control; (2) LPS-challenged control; (3) LPS+0.5% Arg; (4) LPS+1.0% Arg. On day 16, pigs were injected with LPS or sterile saline. At 6 h post-injection, pigs were killed for evaluation of small intestinal morphology and intestinal gene expression. Within 48 h of challenge, 0.5% Arg alleviated the weight loss induced by LPS challenge (P<=0.025). In all three intestinal segments, 0.5 or 1.0% Arg mitigated intestinal morphology impairment (e.g. lower villus height and higher crypt depth) induced by LPS challenge (P<0.05), and alleviated the decrease of crypt cell proliferation and the increase of villus cell apoptosis after LPS challenge (P< 0.01). The 0.5% Arg prevented the elevation of jejunal IL-6 mRNA abundance (P=0.082), and jejunal (P=0.030) and ileal (P=0.039) TNF-γ mRNA abundance induced by LPS challenge. The 1.0% Arg alleviated the elevation of jejunal IL-6 mRNA abundance (P=0.053) and jejunal TNF-γ mRNA abundance (P=0.003) induced by LPS challenge. The 0.5% Arg increased PPARγ mRNA abundance in all three intestinal segments (P< 0.10), and 1.0% Arg increased duodenal PPARγ mRNA abundance (P=0.094). These results indicate that Arg supplementation has beneficial effects in alleviating gut mucosal injury induced by LPS challenge. Additionally, it is possible that the protective effects of Arg on the intestine are associated with decreasing the expression of intestinal pro-inflammatory cytokines through activating PPARγ expression. © The Authors 2008.

52749091438	Fracture toughness of multiferroic composite materials	Fracture toughness of unidirectional ferromagnetic fiber reinforced ferroelectric matrix composite was studied based on the energy approach in a view of large scale. A half space edge crack with crack face perpendicular to the external fields was considered. The energy release rate was derived explicitly considering the magnetoelectric coupling under combined mechanical, electric and magnetic loading. Because of the magnetoelectric coupling through the interface, the fracture toughness is highly dependent on the polarization properties of the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic portions besides the volume fraction and the elastic properties of each composite. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

52149085209	A new motion detection algorithm based on snake and mean shift	Active contour model and mean shift are both motion detection algorithms. Each of them has its own merits and shortcomings. An active contour tends to be tracked by noise points and results in a false boundary. A mean shift vector always points to the edge area when the start point is around the object With initial curves given near the objects in each image automatically, we presented a new motion detection algorithm which used the internal energy of active contour to keep a curve continuous and smooth, and also used the mean shift vector to track the curve to the real object boundary step by step, with an iterative process. Experimental results showed that this algorithm can improve the segmenting results greatly in noisy videos. © 2008 IEEE.

55649104103	Thickness effect of a thin film on the stress field due to the eigenstrain of an ellipsoidal inclusion	Solutions of the stress field due to the eigenstrain of an ellipsoidal inclusion in the film/substrate half-space are obtained via the Fourier transforms and Stroh eigenrelation equations. Based on the acquired solutions, the effect of a thin film's thickness on the stress field is investigated with two types of ellipsoidal inclusions considered. The results in this paper show that if the thickness of the thin film increases, its effect on the stress field will become weaker, and can even be neglected. In the end, a guide rule is introduced to simplify the calculation of similar problems in engineering. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A total of sixty pigs were weaned at 21 d of age (BW = 5.64±0.23 kg) and allocated on the basis of BW and litter to three dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design. The dietary treatments were: control group (basal diet), antibiotics group (basal diet+0.02% colistin), and ASE group (basal diet+0.1% ASE). On d 7, 14 and 28 after consuming the experimental diets, five piglets per group were sacrificed and then the contents from the jejunum, ileum and cecum were collected to determine changes in the microbial community by using a polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique and estimating the contents of Lactobacillus and E. coli by in vitro culturing methods. The results showed that the ASE promoted the microflora diversity in the cecum. Enumeration of bacteria in the gut contents showed that the number of Lactobacillus increased (p<0.05), while that of E. coli decreased (p<0.05) when compared with the other 2 groups as the days of age progressed post-weaning. These findings suggested that the ASE, as a substitute for dietary antimicrobial products, could improve the development of the normal gut microflora and suppress bacterial pathogens, and effectively promote a healthy intestinal environment.

65349103150	Thoracoscopic enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma: A retrospective study on 40 cases	Esophageal leiomyoma is the most common benign esophageal tumor. Thoracoscopic enucleation is currently a preferred approach to most of these lesions. We present our experiences of enucleation of these tumors using thoracoscopic approach. A retrospective review of 40 patients who underwent enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma from 1997 to 2007 in our institute was conducted. Presenting symptoms, operative approach, tumor size, tumor shape, outcomes, and indication for this approach were analyzed. Forty patients were identified. Postoperative histopathology confirmed the leiomyoma in all patients. The thoracoscopic enucleation was completed in 34 cases, and the operation was converted to open procedure in six cases. Reasons for conversion included too small tumors to be visualized in two cases, thoracic cavity adhesion in one case, and the too large tumors in three cases. The median operating time was 70 min (50 to 210 min). Mean tumor size was 3.7 cm (0.5-10 cm). There were no major postoperative complications. Symptoms especially dysphasia were relieved postoperatively. Short- and long-term follow-up was satisfactory with none of the patients having tumor recurrences or other problems. Thoracoscopic enucleation of esophageal leiomyoma is technically safe and effective. It is currently the best choice for management of esophageal leiomyoma 1 to 5 cm in diameter. It can also be tried on a tumor larger than 5 cm, although the possibility of conversion to thoracotomy increases along with tumor growing and surrounding the esophagus. © 2009 International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.

65649105121	Mycoplasma pneumoniae Induced the Expression of Substance P and Its Receptor NK-1 in Human Airway Epithelial Cells	Expression of neurokinin-1 (NK-1, substance P receptor) is increased in the airway epithelium of asthmatic subjects who demonstrate the presence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in their airways by polymerase chain reaction. M. pneumoniae exposure may increase preprotachykinin-A mRNA expression (PPT-A, the precursor to substance P) and protein expression of substance P and NK-1 from human airway epithelial cells. Normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were cultured and exposed to M. pneumoniae for 48 h at concentrations of ten, 20 and 50 colony forming units/ml in the presence and absence of an anti-P1 adhesin antibody that blocks M. pneumoniae binding. Real time PCR for PPT-A was performed, the results were expressed as fold change over negative control. Protein expression of Substance P and NK-1 was detected by Western Blot. As M. pneumoniae concentrations increased, PPT-A mRNA expression increased over negative control, and this increase was blocked by anti-P1 adhesin antibody. The PCR products were verified by sequencing, and found to be the transcript variants gamma and delta, both precursors for substance P. As M. pneumoniae concentrations increased, the protein expression of substance P increased over negative control without a dose response effect, NK-1 protein expression increased with a dose response effect in the airway epithelial cells. This effect was inhibited in the presence of anti-P1 adhesin antibody. M. pneumoniae increased substance P and NK-1 expression in human bronchial epithelial cells, and this effect was attenuated by blockade of M. pneumoniae binding. These results suggested that M. pneumoniae may promote neurogenic inflammation. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

66149165911	Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ potentiates pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and adrenal and somatotropic changes of weaned pigs after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide challenge	Our previous study demonstrated mRNA and protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) in the immune system of weaned pigs. In this report, to test the hypothesis that activation of PPAR-γ in immune system modulates inflammatory response, and adrenal and somatotropic responses associated with immune challenge, we administered intraperitoneally PPAR-γ agonist and/or antagonist in weaned pigs subjected to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Unexpectedly, we found that a single injection of the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone (given at 3 mg/kg body weight 30 min before LPS injection) failed to block pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS injection. Rather, plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), mRNA abundance of TNF-α in thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph node and peripheral white blood cells, mRNA abundance of IL-6 in thymus, protein levels of TNF-α in spleen and mesenteric lymph node, and protein levels of IL-6 in spleen and mesenteric lymph node, were elevated beyond the levels in control pigs injected with LPS.

67650723693	Dietary supplementation with Astragalus polysaccharide enhances ileal digestibilities and serum concentrations of amino acids in early weaned piglets	Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on growth performance, apparent ileal digestibilities (AID) of amino acids (AA), and their serum concentrations in early weaned piglets. In Exp. 1, 60 pigs were weaned at 21 days of age (BW 7.35 ± 0.23 kg) and allocated to three treatments (20 pigs/treatment), representing supplementing 0.0% (control), 0.02% colistin (antibiotic), or 0.1% APS to a corn- and soybean meal-based diet. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed/gain ratio (F/G) were measured weekly. Blood samples were obtained from five pigs selected randomly from each treatment for the measurement of serum free AA concentrations on days 7, 14, and 28. In Exp. 2, 12 pigs were weaned at 21 day of age (BW 7.64 ± 0.71 kg), assigned to three treatment groups as in Exp. 1, and surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the terminal ileum. Ileal digesta samples were obtained for the measurement of AID of AA on days 7, 14 and 28. Dietary APS did not affect ADFI, but enhanced (P < 0.05) ADG by 11 and 4.4%, and improved F/G by 5.6 and 8.4%, respectively, compared with the control and antibiotic groups. Addition of APS to the diet increased AID and serum concentrations of most nutritionally essential and non-essential AA (including arginine, proline, glutamate, lysine, methionine, tryptophan, and threonine) on days 14 and 28. Circulating levels of total AA were affected by the age of pigs and treatment × time interaction. Collectively, these findings indicate that APS may ameliorate the digestive and absorptive function and regulate AA metabolism to beneficially increase the entry of dietary AA into the systemic circulation, which provide a mechanism to explain the growth-promoting effect of APS in early weaned piglets. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

70349586127	Dietary l-arginine supplementation alleviates immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide in weaned pigs	A study was conducted to investigate the effects of l-arginine (Arg) on performance and immune function in cyclophosphamide (CY) immunosuppressed weaned pigs. The weaned pigs were allotted randomly into one of three treatments, including: (1) non-challenged control; (2) CY-challenged group; and (3) CY + 0.5% Arg. On days 14 and 21 of the trial, pigs were injected with CY or sterile saline. Blood samples were obtained on days 21 and 28 of the trial for further analysis. On day 28, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction was evaluated. Arg alleviated the decrease of average daily gain (P < 0.05) induced by CY challenge from days 21 to 28. Arg mitigated the CY-induced decrease of total white blood cell numbers (P < 0.05) on day 28 and improved the lymphocyte percentage on day 21 (P < 0.05). Arg increased the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (P < 0.05), and attenuated the decrease of bovine serum albumin antibody level caused by CY treatment (P < 0.05) on day 28. In addition, Arg elevated the levels of serum interleukin-2 and interferon-γ (P < 0.05) on day 28, and mitigated the decrease of serum interferon-γ level on day 21 (P < 0.05). These results indicate that Arg supplementation has beneficial effects in attenuating the immunosuppressive effects of CY challenge, therefore improving growth performance of young pigs. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

77549088368	Up-regulated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of weaned pigs after Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide challenge	The expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) was investigated in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of weaned pigs after injection with 100 μg/kg bodyweight Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n = 6) and control pigs injected with sterile saline (n = 6). LPS increased PPARγ mRNA and protein expression in the hypothalamus (23.8 and 3.1-fold relative to controls, respectively), pituitary gland (9.2 and 2.0-fold, respectively) and adrenal gland (3.5 and 2.3-fold, respectively) (P < 0.05). LPS also induced an increase in PPARγ immunohistochemical staining in the hypothalamus (1.3-fold), adenohypophysis (1.3-fold), adrenal cortex (1.4-fold) and adrenal medulla (1.6-fold) (P < 0.05). Concurrent with up-regulated expression of PPARγ, LPS increased the concentrations of plasma corticotrophin-releasing hormone (2.1-fold) and adrenocorticotrophin (1.4-fold) (P < 0.05). LPS also induced elevations of interleukin 6 and tumour necrosis factor α mRNA levels in the hypothalamus (4.0 and 3.2-fold, respectively), pituitary gland (20.7 and 5.1-fold, respectively) and adrenal gland (3.9 and 3.3-fold, respectively) (P < 0.05). PPARγ may play a role in the regulation of neuroendocrine responses associated with immunological stress in pigs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77952267926	The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in chinese postmenopausal women and the optimum body composition indices to predict it	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Chinese postmenopausal women and explore the optimum body composition indices to predict MetS. METHODS: Participants were independent, community-dwelling women. Recruitment occurred through advertisements in newspapers and flyers posted in the local community. A total of 181 postmenopausal women were recruited. Their parameters were measured, including body height, weight, waist circumference (WC), hip circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, blood pressure, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and body fat (BF; %). Logistic regression analyses were applied for correlation between stated variables. Optimization of body composition indices to predict MetS in postmenopausal women was analyzed with the area under the curve of the receiver. RESULTS: The prevalence of MetS in postmenopausal women was 33.7%. The risk factors of MetS in postmenopausal women were age, family history of metabolic disorders (obesity, hypertension, hyperlipemia, and diabetes mellitus), body composition indices (body mass index [BMI], WC, waist-to-hip ratio, sagittal abdominal diameter, and BF), and metabolic indices (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and triglyceride; odds ratio > 1, P < 0.05), and the protective factor is high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (odds ratio = 0.114, P < 0.05). All body composition indices in our study had a positive correlation with number of MetS factors. The body composition indices in our study showed a positive correlation with each other (P < 0.001). BMI and WC were highly correlated with BF (r > 0.900, P < 0.001). Through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, it was determined that body composition indices (WC, 80.75 cm; BF, 36.695%; sagittal abdominal diameter, 18.35 cm; or BMI, 24.835 kg/m) could be used to predict MetS. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MetS in Chinese postmenopausal women is 33.7%. Body composition indices (WC ≥80.75 cm, BF ≥36.695%, sagittal abdominal diameter ≥18.35 cm, or BMI ≥24.835 kg/m

77956296720	Therapeutic effect of heparin on TNBS-induced colitis in rats and its mechanism	Background: Hypercoagulable state is common during the active stage of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the relationship between hypercoagulation and inflammation remains unclear. Aims: To study the relationship between coagulation and inflammation in trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis as well as the therapeutic effect and mechanism of heparin on colitis in rat model. Methods: Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group, colitis group, heparin group and heparin+ protamine group. Colitis was induced by TNBS in the latter three groups. Disease activity index (DAI), macroscopic score, histopathologic score, serum TNF-α level, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), antithrombin (AT) activity and blood platelet count were determined. Results: Compared with normal control group, DAI, macroscopic score, histopathologic score and serum TNF-α level in colitis group were significantly increased, PT, APTT and AT activity were significantly decreased (P<0.05), and blood platelet count was significantly increased (P<0.05). After treatment with heparin, all the above-mentioned indices were significantly ameliorated (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between colitis group and heparin+ protamine group. Conclusions: Abnormality of coagulation is observed in colitis induced by TNBS, and heparin is effective in controlling the coagulation abnormality activated by inflammation. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of heparin is probably related with its anticoagulation activity. Protamine can neutralize the anticoagulation activity of heparin and at the same time it ceases the anti-inflammatory effect.

77956914791	Downregulation of ABI1 expression affects the progression and prognosis of human gastric carcinoma	Abelson interactor protein-1 (ABI1) is a promising candidate tumor suppressor, and plays critical roles both in the pathogenesis of BCR-Abl-induced leukemia and in the spread of several solid tumors. The expression of ABI1 and its role in cancer progression and prognosis are largely unknown in the majority of solid tumors, including gastric cancer. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between ABI1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics, tumor progression, and prognosis of patients with gastric carcinoma. Tissue specimens were from 103 gastric cancer patients who underwent gastrectomy in our hospital between January 2000 and December 2007. Among them 59 tumor tissue samples were matched with normal tissue samples. The expression of ABI1 protein was measured using immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. Meanwhile, quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting were used to identify the expression of ABI1 in human gastric normal mucosal cell line (GES-1) and gastric cancer cell lines (N87, AGS). We performed a statistical analysis of the potential correlation between ABI1 expression and the patients' clinicopathological characteristics, 5-year survival, and median survival time. The immunohistochemical staining results of 59 patients showed that ABI1 was expressed in 28.8% (17/59) of gastric cancer tissues, compared to 91.5% (54/59) of normal samples. ABI1 expression in 103 patients was strongly correlated with tumor differentiation, clinical stage, and lymph node status (P < 0.01). The 5-year survival rate was 15.3% in the ABI1-negative group and 63.7% in the ABI1-positive group. Median survival time in the ABI1-negative and ABI1-positive groups was 25.0 months (95% CI: 19.7-30.3) and 74.0 months (95% CI: 54.6-93.3), respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (χ

78149401439	Effects of rosiglitazone, an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor γ, on intestinal damage induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in weaned pigs	Objective - To determine whether rosiglitazone, an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, could alleviate intestinal damage induced by Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in weaned pigs. Animals - 18 weaned pigs (mean ± SD age, 28 ± 3 days). Procedures - Pigs were allocated to 3 treatments (6 pigs/treatment). Control pigs were injected IP with dimethyl sulfoxide and then injected 30 minutes later with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution, LPS-treated pigs were injected IP with dimethyl sulfoxide and then injected 30 minutes later with LPS (100 μ g/kg, IP), and rosiglitazone plus LPS-treated pigs were injected with rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg, IP) and then injected 30 minutes later with LPS (100 μ g/kg, IP). Pigs were euthanized 3 hours after challenge exposure, and samples of the small intestines were collected for histologic, biochemical, and immunohistochemical examination. Results - Rosiglitazone alleviated LPS-induced intestinal damage, which was manifested as a lower crypt depth in the duodenum and a higher villus height-to-crypt depth ratio in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Rosiglitazone also mitigated inhibition of crypt cell proliferation in the jejunum and ileum induced by LPS injection. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone significantly increased the number of cells that stained for PPAR? and significantly decreased the number of cells that stained for inducible nitric oxide synthase. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Rosiglitazone alleviated intestinal damage induced by LPS injection in weaned pigs. The protective effects of rosiglitazone on the intestines may be associated with inhibition of intestinal proinflammatory mediators, such as inducible nitric oxide synthase.

This was done by testing 2395 environmental/equipment swab and mock quality control samples from 14 loci on sample collection equipment for human β-globin and HPV DNA. Human β-globin was present in 3.88% of these samples but no HPV DNA was detected. There was no evidence of HPV DNA contamination in the sample collection or processing under the rigorous quality control in our ongoing cohort study. The study results indicated that use of disposable appliances, rigorous environmental cleaning and a high standard of sterilisation of reusable instruments are important in contamination prevention. © 2010 The Hospital Infection Society.

We found that Young's modulus and resonant frequencies significantly decreased with decreasing diameter when the diameter was less than 100 nm for fixed/free boundary condition, while they slightly decreased for fixed/fixed boundary condition. When the diameter is larger than 200 nm, the surface stresses may be neglected. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

Two hundred and forty 10-day-old broilers were randomly assigned to one of the five dietary treatments including: I) control diet; ii) mold-contaminated diet; iii) moldcontaminated diet+0.05% EGM; iv) mold-contaminated diet+0.2% HSCAS; v) mold-contaminated diet+0.1% CMA. At 35-days-old, blood and liver tissue samples were collected for analysis. 0.1% CMA improved ADG and ADFI during 10-42 d compared to the moldcontaminated group (p<0.05). The mold-contaminated diet increased total white blood cell (WBC) number, haemoglobin (Hgb) concentration, hematocrit (Hct) level, serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ?-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities, and decreased red blood cell (RBC) number and serum globulin (GLB) and urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations (p<0.05). The three mycotoxin adsorbents alleviated the alteration of RBC, WBC, Hgb and AST caused by the mold-contaminated diet. Furthermore, 0.1% CMA increased GLB concentration and decreased Hct level and GGT activity (p<0.05). Liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was reduced, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was increased by the mold-contaminated diet (p<0.05). Both EGM and HSCAS prevented the increase of MPO activity (p<0.05). Liver lesion, including severe vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes, was observed in chicks fed the mold-contaminated diet. 0.05% EGM prevented these effects except for biliary hyperplasia and mild vacuolar degeneration. 0.2% HSCAS showed medium vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes. Liver of broilers fed 0.1% CMA revealed a mild vacuolar degeneration. These results indicate that a mold-contaminated diet results in adverse effects on blood parameters and liver morphology. 0.05% EGM and 0.2% HSCAS partially alleviated the adverse effects. However, 0.1% CMA almost completely ameliorated the adverse effects.

A study was conducted to investigate the effects of an esterified glucomannan (EGM), a hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) and a compound mycotoxin adsorbent (CMA) on performance, nutrient retention and meat quality in broilers fed on mould-contaminated feed. Mouldcontaminated diets were prepared by replacing half of the non-contaminated maize in the basal diets with mould-contaminated maize, which contained 450·6 mg/kg of aflatoxin B1, 68·4 mg/kg of ochratoxin A and 320·5 mg/kg of T-2 toxin. 2. The mould-contaminated diet significantly decreased body weight gain (BWG) between 10 and 21d, feed intake (FI) between 35 and 42d, the apparent retention of crude lipid and phosphorus, and the lightness (L*) value of breast and thigh muscle. It also significantly increased the redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) value in breast muscle and the b* value in thigh muscle. 3. The addition of 0 2% HSCAS significantly increased FI between 35 and 42d and the apparent retention of phosphorus. Supplementation with 0 1% CMA in the contaminated diet significantly improved BWG from 10 to 21d, and increased FI from 35 to 42d and from 10 to 42d. CMA also significantly increased the apparent retention of crude lipid, crude protein, ash and phosphorus. All three mycotoxin-adsorbent treatments significantly improved the L* values of breast and thigh muscle when compared with the mould-contaminated group. Supplementation with 0·1% CMA in the contaminated diet significantly decreased b* value and improved tenderness in thigh muscle. 0·05% EGM significantly decreased b* value of thigh muscle compared to mould-contaminated group. 4. The results indicated that mycotoxins in contaminated feed retard growth, nutrient retention and meat quality, whereas the addition of 0·05% EGM, 0·2% HSCAS or 0·1% CMA prevents the adverse effects of mycotoxins to varying extents, with 0 1% CMA being the most effective adsorbent treatment. © 2011 British Poultry Science Ltd.

0036431868	A constitutive equation for viscoelastic porous gels during drying process	In this investigation, a constitutive equation was developed for viscoelastic porous gels during drying process based on the mechanism of shrinkage. One important application for the analysis is to predict the residual stress developed during the drying of gels in the sol-gel fabrication process. The gels can be modeled as porous continuum material, where the solid phases are viscoelastic material, and the pores are filled with some kinds of liquid. During drying, the large capillary forces generated in the tiny (∼ 3-10 nm) pores serve as the main driving force for the shrinkage of gels, whereas the applied forces and hydrostatic pressure from the liquid and also contribute to the deformation process. Finally, the tensile residual stress in the thin film that developed in the drying was predicted based on the constitutive equation. It is hopeful that the developed viscoelastic constitutive equation can be adapted into a FEM code to predict the residual stress and optimum design the fabrication parameters without cracking of the specimen.

80054074946	Autoimmune phenomenon in hepatitis C: Differential diagnosis and therapeutic principle	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and interferon (IFN) treatment may induce the occurrence of a series of autoantibodies and even induce autoimmune disease. The autoimmune disease will not relieve completely even IFN treatment has been stopped. Relevant treatment including immunosuppressants may be needed. To clarify the clinical characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) induced by IFN, 1626 cases of hepatitis C treated with IFN in the Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Kurashiki Medical Center, Japan from 1992 to 2008 were analyzed. Among them, only one female patient developed AIH. The patient recovered after steroid therapy. HCV RNA infection may induce the producing of non-organ specific autoantibodies, and IFN treatment itself also can induce the appearance of autoantibodies. Such an associated autoimmune phenomenon is not an absolute contraindication to IFN therapy. However, IFN should be used cautiously when the titers of autoantibodies are very high.

80054092185	Autoimmune liver injury and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	Autoimmune liver disease (AILD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are two major types of chronic inflammatory liver diseases that lead to progressive decline of liver function. Both of them are lack of characteristic clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters. As the worldwide popularity of Western lifestyle and the global trend of obesity and NAFLD, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) would be co-existence with NAFLD, which makes the diagnosis more difficult. When the patients have definite NAFLD and unexplained liver function deterioration, the possibility of concurrent AILD should be taken into account. This article summarized the clinical and pathologic features of "NAFLD-AILD co-existence" and explored its possible mechanism.

The diagnosis of BCS depends on hepatic vein angiography and the key point of therapy is to relieve the obstruction. Hepatic veno occlusive disease (VOD) is caused by stenosis or obstruction of central vein and sublobular veins of hepatic lobules resulting in portal hypertension. Its clinical manifestation is similar to that of BCS and its diagnosis depends on liver biopsy. The treatment and prognosis of these two diseases are different from cirrhosis caused by parenchymal liver diseases. Clinically,it is important to differentiate these three diseases.

With different spin-coating speeds and concentrations of colloidal silver nanoparticles, various assembly structures could form on those substrates. On HOPG, Ag nanoparticles were absorbed and aligned along single-atom-height step edges to form a linear one-layer structure. And on silicon chip and microscopic glass, one-layer closed packing fractal structure and two-layer closed packing ring were observed respectively. © 2011 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84855903955	Compliant substrate controlling the phase diagrams of multiferroic multilayers	For a ferroelectric/ferromagnetic multilayer sandwiched between substrates, the tunability of the internal strains, ferroelectric states and phase diagrams by adjusting the substrate thickness are investigated. Based on the continuum mechanics and phenomenological theory, the thermodynamic potentials of the restraint ferroelectric/elastic and ferroelectric/ferromagnetic multilayer are constructed, respectively. Due to the interaction of different layers mediated by the mechanical coupling, the total strains in different layers are solved as functions of the misfit strains, electric polarizations of the ferroelectric slabs and magnetic polarizations of the ferromagnetic slabs. More importantly, the phase diagrams of multiferroic multilayer sandwiched between substrates are comprehensively investigated based on the modified thermodynamic potential. From our results, it can be found that the phase diagrams of the multiferroic multilayers can be effectively shifted by changing the multilayer-substrate thickness ratio, and the phase diagram configuration of the multiferroic multilayer can be dramatically changed by controlling the co-effect of the multilayer-substrate thickness ratio and other tunable quantities, such as multilayer-substrate misfit strains, in-multilayer thickness ratio and in-multilayer misfit strains. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862923545	Intestinal immune barrier integrity in rats with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis	Background Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has emerged as the major cause of chronic liver injury. Intestinal barrier plays an important role in the pathogenis of NAFLD. The aim of this article was to assess intestinal immune barrier function during the development of NAFLD. Methods Totally 60 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 2 groups: normal diet (ND) group and high-fat diet (HFD) group. NAFLD rat model was established in the HFD rat group. Portal blood endotoxin level was assessed by limulus test. The percentage of CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and lymphocytes in Peyer's patches (PP) were analysed by flow cytometry. Intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Paired Student's t test was used for the statistic analysis. Results HFD rats presented with simple steatosis at the 4th and 8th week and progressed to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis at the 12th week. Elevated lipopolysaccharides (LPS) level in HFD rats was observed at the 8th week ((1.54±0.30) times of ND group, P <0.01). CD4/CD8 ratios in PBMC and PP of HFD rats were increased at the 4th week ((1.50±0.47) and (1.63±0.34) times of ND group, P <0.05) and decreased at the 8th week ((0.50±0.16) and (0.61±0.26) times of ND group, P <0.05). At the 12th week, CD4/CD8 ratio ((1.47±0.46) times, P <0.05) in PP increased to levels observed in the 4th week. Intestinal SIgA expression of HFD rats was remarkably up-regulated at 12th week ((2.70±1.65) times, P <0.05). Conclusion Liver-gut axis in rats with NAFLD may mediate and improve intestinal immune function by increased CD4/CD8 ratio in PP and increased production of SIgA.

84863032564	MicroRNA-320a inhibits tumor invasion by targeting neuropilin 1 and is associated with liver metastasis in colorectal cancer	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in regulating diverse cellular pathways. Although there is emerging evidence that various miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in colorectal cancer (CRC), the role of miRNAs in mediating liver metastasis remains unexplored. The expression profile of miRNAs in liver metastasis and primary CRC tissues was analyzed by miRNA microarrays and verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 62 CRC patients, the expression levels of miR-320a were determined by real-time PCR, and the effects on migration and invasion of miR-320a were determined using a transwell assay. miR-320a target genes were confirmed by luciferase assay, real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. A set of miRNAs was found to be dysregulated in the liver metastasis tissues compared to matched primary CRC tissues, and the expression levels of miR-320a were significantly decreased in the liver metastasis tissues examined. miR-320a was correlated with tumor progression in CRC. miR-320a was downregulated in liver metastatic colon cancer cells and inhibited liver metastatic colon cancer cell migration and invasion. miR-320a directly binds to the 3'UTR of neuropilin 1 (NRP-1), a protein that functions as a co-receptor of vascular epithelial growth factor. miR-320a downregulated the expression of NRP-1 at both the mRNA and protein levels. These data demonstrated that miR-320a may be useful for identifying CRC patients that are at an elevated risk for developing liver metastasis. Our findings suggest that miR-320a may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

84866009942	Dietary L-arginine supplementation alleviates liver injury caused by Escherichia coli LPS in weaned pigs	This study was conducted to evaluate whether dietary supplementation with L-arginine (Arg) could attenuate Escherichia coli LPS-induced liver injury through the TLR4 signaling pathway in weaned pigs. Eighteen weaned pigs were allotted to three treatments: non-challenged control, LPS challenged control and LPS-+-0.5% Arg. On d 18, pigs were injected with LPS at 100-μg/kg of body weight (BW) or sterile saline. Blood samples were obtained at 4-h post-injection. Pigs were then sacrificed for the collection of liver samples. Arg supplementation (0.5%) alleviated liver morphological impairment, including hepatocyte caryolysis, karyopycnosis and fibroblast proliferation induced by LPS challenge; it mitigated the increase of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities induced by LPS (P-<-0.05); it prevented the increase of hepatic TNF-α, malondialdehyde contents and mast cell number induced by LPS administration (P-<-0.05); and it attenuated the elevation of hepatic NF-κB and TLR4-positive cell percentages (P-<-0.05). These results indicate that Arg supplementation has beneficial effects in attenuating hepatic morphological and functional injury induced by LPS challenge in piglets. Additionally, it is possible that the protective effects of Arg on the liver are associated with a decreased release of liver pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals through inhibiting TLR4 signaling. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

0036775089	Prevalence and pathogenicity of TT virus infection in patients with liver diseases	AIM: To investigate the prevalence of TT virus in patients with liver diseases and the association between liver diseases and TTV, especially genotype G1. METHODS: TTV DNA in serum were examined in 83 patients with non A-non E hepatitis,75 patients with chronic liver diseases and 105 general people. TTV was detected by PCR with two sets of primers, one of which was located in the 5′ UTR and the other was in the ORF1. The genotyping assay was based on RFLP. Some PCR products were sequenced. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV were 95.2%, 93.3% and 87.6% in patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis, patients with liver diseases and general people respectively. There were no significant differences among the rates (P >0.05). The positive rates of genotype G1 were 32.5%, 38.7% and 19.0% in three groups respectively. The positive rates of G1 in patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis and in patients with liver diseases were significantly higher than that in the general people (P <0.05, P <0.01). But there were no significant differences in age, gender, level of ALT and frequency of blood transfusion history between genotype G1 positive and negative patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis. The positive rate of genotype G1 was 25.0% in patients with liver cirrhosis or carcinoma associated with HBV infection and 37.1% in patients with chronic B hepatitis. There were no significant differences between them (P >0.05). The positive rate of G1 was 40% in patients with liver cirrohosis or carcinoma associated with HCV infection and 100% in patients with chronic C hepatitis. There were no significant differences between them (P >0.05). There was no significant difference in age, gender, levels of ALT between G1 positive and negative patients with chronic B hepatitis or HBsAg carrier (P >0.05). TTV-positive rate in the general people aged 21-30 (72.2%) was significantly lower than that, in the general people aged 31-40 (96.2%, P <0.01) and aged 41-50 (93.1%, P<0.05). The positive rate of G1 infection in the general people was not related to age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: There is very high prevalence of TTV infection in general population and patients with liver diseases. Genotype G1 is associated with liver disease, however, its pathogenicity may be very weak.

METHODS: Age-matched 18 DD-IBS, 14 CD-IBS and 30 FC patients were selected, and 18 volunteers as healthy controls. Rectal sensitivity was evaluated with rectal balloon distension. RESULTS: The volume threshold of the first sensation, stool sensation and pain in DD-IBS were significantly lower than that in DD-IBS, FC and healthy controls (P<0.01). There was no difference of rectal perception among DD-IBS, FC and healty controls (P>0.05). In each group, the rectal perception threshold in female was significantly lower than that in males (P<0.05), but there was no difference between younger and older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Dirrhea-dominant IBS has lower rectal perception threshold than other three groups, but there was no difference of rectal perception among DD-IBS, FC and healty controls. The rectal perception threshold in female was significantly lower than that in male. Age has no influence on the rectal perception.

0038545772	On the calculation of energy release rate for viscoelastic cracked laminates	The energy release rate (ERR) of crack growth as the energy change at the same time t between the two states of the structure is redefined, one is with crack length a under the loading σ(t), an other is the state with crack length a + Δa under the same loading condition. Thus the defined energy release rate corresponds to the released energy when a crack grows from a to a + Δa in an infinitesimal time. It is found that under a given loading history, the ERR is a function of time, and its maximum value should correspond with the critical state for delamination to propagate. Following William's work, the explicit expressions of ERR for DCB experimental configurations to measure the interfacial fracture toughness have been obtained through the classical beam assumption.

0038638908	Primary biliary cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis: A case report and review of literature	Aim: To summarize the characteristics of patients suffered from primary biliary cirrhosis associated with ulcerative colitis. Methods: To report a new case and review the literature. Results: There were 18 cases (including our case) of primary biliary cirrhosis complicated with ulcerative colitis reported in the literature. Compared with classical primary biliary cirrhosis, the patients were more often males and younger similar. The bowel lesions were usually mild with proctitis predominated. While ulcerative colitis was diagnosed before primary biliary cirrhosis in 13 cases, the presentation of primary biliary cirrhosis was earlier than that of ulcerative colitis in our new case reported here. The prevalence of primary biliary cirrhosis among patients of ulcerative colitis was almost 30 times higher than in general population. Conclusion: Association of primary biliary cirrhosis with ulcerative colitis is rare. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease in patients with ulcerative colitis, and vice versa.

The corner geometry is simplified as the semi-infinite wedge. Then the two-dimensional thermal stress distribution around the corner was obtained explicitly. Based on the stress calculation, the strain energy density factor criterion is used to evaluate the strength of the structure, which can not only give the critical condition for the stressed, but also determine the direction of fracture initiation around the corner.

84869129239	Inhibits TLR4 and NOD2 Signaling Pathways in Weaned Pigs after LPS Challenge1-3	Long-chain (n-3) PUFA exert beneficial effects on inflammatory bowel diseases in animal models and clinical trials. In addition, pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins (NOD) play a critical role in intestinal inflammation. We hypothesized that fish oil could alleviate Escherichia coli LPS-induced intestinal injury via modulation of TLR4 and NOD signaling pathways. Twenty-four weaned piglets were used in a 2 3 2 factorial design and the main factors included a dietary treatment (5% corn oil or 5% fish oil) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). After feeding fish oil or corn oil diets for 21 d, pigs were injected with LPS or saline. At 4 h postinjection, blood samples were collected and pigs were killed. EPA, DHA, and total (n-3) PUFA were enriched in intestinal mucosa through fish supplementation. Fish oil improved intestinal morphology, indicated by greater villus height and villus height:crypt depth ratio, and intestinal barrier function, indicated by decreased plasma diamine oxidase (DAO) activity and increased mucosal DAO activity as well as enhanced protein expression of intestinal tight junction proteins including occludin and claudin-1. Moreover, fish oil decreased intestinal TNFa and PGE2 concentrations and caspase-3 and heat shock protein 70 protein expression. Finally, fish oil downregulated the mRNA expression of intestinal TLR4 and its downstream signals myeloid differentiation factor 88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, TNFa receptor-associated factor 6, and NOD2, and its adaptor molecule, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2. Fish oil decreased the protein expression of intestinal NFkB p65. These results indicate that fish oil supplementation is associated with inhibition of TLR4 and NOD2 signaling pathways and concomitant improvement of intestinal integrity under an inflammatory condition. © 2012 American Society for Nutrition.

84870466116	Symptom-based relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and laryngopharyngeal reflux disease	Objective: To explore the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD) based on symptoms. Methods: A total of 1090 patients undergoing upper digestive tract motility test were invited to complete the surveys of reflux disease questionnaire and reflux symptom index from August 2007 to October 2010. And 895 responders provided valid answers. There were 474 females and 421 males. Results: Among 895 responders, 351 patients had neither, 218 suffered both conditions, 237 were diagnosed as GERD alone and 89 LPRD alone. No difference was found in age(P = 0.383) or gender ratio(P = 0.227). In 455 GERD patients, there were 218 LPRD cases (47.9%). In 307 LPRD patients, 218 (71.0%) had concurrent GERD. In GERD patients, the frequency and degree of feeling of stomach content reflux into mouth were correlated with RSI(r = 0.115, 0.141, P = 0.007, 0.001). Conclusion: GERD and LPRD may coexist or occur alone. Because of a high concurrent ratio of LPRD in GERD, the treatment strategy of GERD should be modified accordingly. In GERD patients, the feeling of stomach content reflux into mouth may suggest a possibility of LPRD. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

Methods: Firstly the ABU expression in GES-1 and AGS cells were identified by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescene, RT-PCR, real-time PCR and Western blot. Secondly human gastric cancer cell line AGS was cultured and transfected with recombinant MSCV-GFP-ABI1 plasmid or blank plasmid MSCV-GPF. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of ABU. And lastly the cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. Results ABI1 was expressed both in normal gastric mucosal cell line GES-1 and in gastric cancer cell line AGS. Compared to GES-1 cells, the ABI1 expression in AGS cells was lowered significantly. There were no significant differences in the ABll mRNA and protein expression between the AGS and AGS-MSCV-GFP groups. Compared to those of the AGS group, the ABll mRNA expression levels of the AGS-MSCV-GFP-ABI1 group increased by 1.87 times (P =0.002).

The results demonstrate that the nucleation prefers to occur around void and stress-concentration site initially; high residual stress exists around inertial inclusion; pre-existing nucleus promotes nearby martensite phase to develop on it. The effects of various defects on heterogeneous nucleation are different, and stress relaxation behavior is the dominant factor which characterizes the whole microstructure evolution process. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875605083	Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) in real-world practice: A national multicenter survey on 8065 patients	Background and Aim: Recently, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) has been developed for diagnosis of GERD. However, no study investigated its value in real-world practice. This study aimed to investigate whether GerdQ can be used for diagnosis of GERD in China. Methods: A national multicenter survey was undertaken; all patients who underwent first diagnostic upper endoscopy for upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were included. Data including the gender, age, symptoms, and endoscopic findings were prospectively recorded. The GerdQ score was measured before endoscopic procedure. Results: Totally, 8065 patients were included. One thousand four hundred and thirty-five patients (17.8%) had reflux esophagitis. Among them, 620 (43.2%) patients' GerdQ score was ≥8. For 2025 patients with GerdQ≥8, 620 (30.6%) were found to have reflux esophagitis, but the remaining 69.4% (1405/2025) were normal. Proportions of patients with reflux esophagitis increased in cut-off range from 3-18 for GerdQ. However, 22.2% of the patients with a GerdQ score≤2 also had reflux esophagitis. Twenty-eight (0.3%) patients were diagnosed to have upper GI malignancies, and 10 out of these 28 (35.7%) patients' GerdQ score was ≥8. Conclusions: The study suggests the proportions of Chinese patients with reflux esophagitis rise up with the increase of GerdQ score, and GerdQ may be used for diagnosis of GERD. However, low GerdQ score cannot exclude the possibility of reflux esophagitis. A minority of Chinese patients has high GerdQ score but is diagnosed with malignancies, even in the absence of alarm features. © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84876453352	Transplantation of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) could reduce colitis in experimental murine models	Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a group of myeloid cells expressing CD11b and Gr-1 marker in mice and comprise at least two subsets: granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs) and monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs). This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of transplantation of G-MDSC subsets from normal mice to colitis mice. Methods: Murine colitis model was induced by the intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). The mice were divided into four groups: control group, TNBS-induced colitis, TNBS-induced colitis plus normal saline injection and TNBS-induced colitis plus bone marrow-derived G-MDSCs injection (transplantation group). G-MDSCs were sorted and enriched via magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) program, the purity of the sorted cells was then identified using flow cytometry analysis. Sex cross-transplantation of dominant G-MDSCs was applied from normal mice to colitis models using i.v. injection. Changes of body weight, survival rate, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity were monitored and macroscopic and microscopic injury scores are calculated. Donor cell Y chromosomes were assessed by in situ hybridization to assess reconstitutions. Results: After the transplantation of bone marrow-derived G-MDSCs from normal mice to colitis models, recipient mice showed increased survival rate, decreased macroscopic and microscopic injury scores and MPO activity, as well as lowered concentration of serum interleukin-6. Y chromosomes staining displayed colonization of donor cells of liver, spleen and colon tissues. Conclusion: Bone marrow-derived G-MDSCs are effective in the improvement of murine colitis, but its effect in human needs further investigation. © 2012 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84880059693	Dysbiosis Signature of Fecal Microbiota in Colorectal Cancer Patients	The human gut microbiota is a complex system that is essential to the health of the host. Increasing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we used pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3 region to characterize the fecal microbiota of 19 patients with CRC and 20 healthy control subjects. The results revealed striking differences in fecal microbial population patterns between these two groups. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis showed that 17 phylotypes closely related to Bacteroides were enriched in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, whereas nine operational taxonomic units, represented by the butyrate-producing genera Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, were significantly less abundant. A positive correlation was observed between the abundance of Bacteroides species and CRC disease status (R = 0.462, P = 0.046 < 0.5). In addition, 16 genera were significantly more abundant in CRC samples than in controls, including potentially pathogenic Fusobacterium and Campylobacter species at genus level. The dysbiosis of fecal microbiota, characterized by the enrichment of potential pathogens and the decrease in butyrate-producing members, may therefore represent a specific microbial signature of CRC. A greater understanding of the dynamics of the fecal microbiota may assist in the development of novel fecal microbiome-related diagnostic tools for CRC. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84881356916	Fish oil increases muscle protein mass and modulates akt/FOXO, TLR4, and NOD signaling in weanling piglets after lipopolysaccharide challenge1-3	Proinflammatory cytokines play a key role in the pathophysiology of muscle atrophy. In addition, n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) exert an inhibitory effect on proinflammatory cytokines affecting many inflammatory diseases. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of fish oil could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced muscle atrophy.Weanling pigswere used in a 2 × 2 factorial design and themain factors included diet (5% corn oil or 5%fish oil) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). After 21 d of treatment with either fish oil or corn oil, pigs received an i.p. injection of either saline or LPS. At 4 h postinjection, blood and muscle samples were obtained. Fish oil led to enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and total n3 PUFAs in muscles. Fish oil increased muscle protein mass, indicated by a higher protein:DNA ratio in gastrocnemius and longissimus dorsi (LD) muscles. In addition, fish oil increased Akt1 mRNA abundance and decreased Forkhead Box O (FOXO) 1 and FOXO4 mRNA abundance. Fish oil also increased phosphorylation of Akt and FOXO1 in gastrocnemius and LD muscles. Fish oil decreased the mRNA abundance of muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle RING finger 1 in gastrocnemius and LD muscles. Moreover, fish oil reduced the plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF) a, muscle TNFa, and prostaglandin E2 concentrations, and muscle TNFa and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) mRNA abundance. Finally, fish oil downregulated the mRNA abundance ofmuscle toll-like receptor (TLR4) and its downstream signalingmolecules [myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), TNFa receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and NF-kB p65], and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein (NOD1), NOD2, and their adaptor molecule [receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2)]. These results indicate fish oil may suppress muscle proinflammatory cytokine production via regulation of TLR and NOD signaling pathways and therefore improve muscle protein mass, possibly through maintenance of Akt/FOXO signaling. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.

84881399674	Rheological model predicting compressive responses of carbon nanotube networks	Carbon nanotube (CNT) macrostructures like anisotropic CNT arrays and isotropic CNT networks have many unique mechanical properties. Among the various properties of CNT networks, their collective responses to compressive deformation are studied here. A rheological model is found to account for the mechanical properties of CNT networks. The computational results show that the compressive responses of CNT networks include the mechanical action of interconnected springs and dry friction elements. The availability of the model is validated by comparing the computed results to the measured data of different density CNT sponges. The good agreement between the computed and measured results suggests that the compressive responses of CNT segments and the sliding friction between CNTs are the major factors contributing to the compressive responses of CNT networks. The effectiveness of the model in describing the CNT networks also indicates that their collective responses are similar to that of the rheological model during the compression cycle. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

84884393446	Fish oil attenuates liver injury caused by LPS in weaned pigs associated with inhibition of TLR4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein signaling pathways	This study evaluated whether fish oil exerted a hepatoprotective effect in a LPS-induced liver injury model via regulation of TLR4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein (NOD) signaling pathways. Twenty-four piglets were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design, and the main factors included diet (5% corn oil or 5% fish oil) and immunological challenge (LPS or saline). Fish oil resulted in enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and total (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids in liver. Less severe liver injury was observed in pigs fed fish oil, as evidenced by improved serum biochemical parameters and less severe histological liver damage. In addition, higher expression of liver tight junction proteins, and lower hepatocyte proliferation and higher hepatocyte apoptosis were observed in pigs fed fish oil. The improved liver integrity in pigs fed fish oil was concurrent with reduced hepatic mRNA expression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 and TNF-α receptor-associated factor 6, and NOD1, NOD2 and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2, as well as reduced hepatic protein expression of NF-κB p65, leading to reduced hepatic pro-inflammatory mediators. These results indicate that fish oil improves liver integrity partially via inhibition of TLR4 and NOD signaling pathways under an inflammatory condition. © 2013 The Author(s).

The bulk total free energy consists of the chemical driving energy, the interfacial energy, the elastic energy, the inertial energy (for a dynamic case), the energy due to applied field and the effects of surface energy which need to be considered at the nanoscale. Single-variant and multi-variant martensitic phase transformations in a nano-sized NiAl plate are considered. The numerical results show the effects of each energy item on the phase transformation and the self-accommodating twinned morphologies as the result of strain energy minimization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84886813202	Fish oil alleviates activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis associated with inhibition of TLR4 and NOD signaling pathways in weaned piglets after a lipopolysaccharide challenge	Long-chain n-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids exert beneficial effects in neuroendocrine dysfunctions in animal models and clinical trials. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects remains to be elucidated. We hypothesized that dietary treatment with fish oil (FO) could mitigate LPS-induced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis through inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein signaling pathways. Twentyfour weaned pigs were used in a 2 × 2 factorial design, and the main factors consisted of diet (5% corn oil vs. 5% FO) and immunological challenge (saline vs. LPS). After 21 d of dietary treatment with 5% corn oil or FO diets, pigs were treated with saline or LPS. Blood samples were collected at 0 (preinjection), 2, and 4 h postinjection, and then pigs were humanely killed by intravenous injection of 40 mg/kg body weight sodium pentobarbital for tissue sample collection. FO led to enrichment of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and total n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, spleen, and thymus. FO decreased plasma adrenocorticotrophin and cortisol concentrations as well as mRNA expressions of hypothalamic corticotropin releasing hormone and pituitary proopiomelanocortin. FO also reduced mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-α in hypothalamus, adrenal gland, spleen, and thymus, and of cyclooxygenase 2 in hypothalamus. Moreover, FO downregulated the mRNA expressions of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its downstream molecules, including cluster differentiation factor 14,myeloid differentiation factor 2, myeloid differentiation factor 88, interleukin- 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6, and nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells p65, and also decreased the mRNA expressions of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2, and their adaptor molecule receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2. These results suggested that FOattenuates the activation of the HPA axis induced by LPS challenge. The beneficial effects of FO on the HPA axis may be associated with decreasing the production of brain or peripheral proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of TLR4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein signaling pathways. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.

0041440160	Theoretical modelling of the chain structure formation in electrorheological fluids	A model was developed to understand the aggregation process of the particles in electrorheological (ER) fluids under the action of an applied electric field. By establishing a generalized virtual work principle based on the consideration that the released electromagnetic energy accompanying the growth of the chain should equal to the dissipated energy related with friction resistance of the viscous fluid in the chain formation, the governing differential equation of the chain growth was established. Based on this energy model, the velocity of the chain forming, and the response time of ER fluid can be predicted. The present model can also predict the effect of the temperature and some microstructural parameters, such as the dielectric constants and concentration of the particles, etc., on the response of an ER system.

0042831155	Effects of transferrin on the growth and proliferation of porcine hepatocytes: A comparison with epidermal growth factor and nicotinamide	Objective. To seek an appropriate culture condition in which porcine hepatocytes can continuously proliferate and express their normal differentiation phenotypes for a longer period of time. Methods. Different types and dosages of reagents, transferrin, epidermal growth factor and nicotinamide were used to culture porcine hepatocytes in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). And the proliferative effects and functions of the cells were detected at different culture times. Results. Transferrin at 5 ng/ml, nicotinamide at 10 mmol/L and epidermal growth factor at 10 ng/ml had better effects on the viability of hepatocytes than DMEM, DMEM + 10% fetal cattle serum FCS and other dosages of these reagents (P<0.05). OD values of MTS were still high in culture at day 7 and day 10, while nearly 30%-35% cells went into the S phase. Good hepatocyte funcitons were found in these groups, and the secretion of albumin was positively correlated with OD value of MTS. The levels of aspartate transaminase and ammonia in these media were lower than those in DMEM and DMEM + FCS. Conclusion. Transferrin at 5 ng/ml, epidermal growth factor at 10 ng/ml and nicotinamide at 10 mmol/L are benefitial to the viability and proliferation of hepatocytes.

0142026831	Effects of fish oil on lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and intracellular signalling in weanling pigs	It has been widely documented that fish oil attenuates inflammatory responses partially via down-regulation of T-lymphocyte function. To determine the anti-inflammatory role of fish oil in weanling pigs, we investigated the effects of fish oil and its functional constituents on peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and subsequent intracellular signalling in inflammatory-challenged weanling pigs and in in vitro cultured lymphocytes. Fish oil (7%) or corn oil (7%) was supplemented to 72 crossbred pigs (7.6 ± 0.3 kg BW and 28 ± 3 days of age) in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment that included an Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (challenged or not challenged). On day 14 and 28 of the experiment. 200 μg/kg BW of LPS or an equivalent amount of sterile saline was administered to the pigs by intraperitoneal injection. Blood samples were collected on days 15 and 29 to determine peripheral blood lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. The results showed that inflammatory challenge decreased average daily gain (P < 0.05) and average daily feed intake (P < 0.05) during days 15-28. Fish oil supplementation had no effect on growth performance. Inflammatory challenge increased lymphocyte proliferalive response to concanavalin A (Con A) (P < 0.05) following each challenge. Fish oil tended to suppress (P < 0.1) the proliferation following the first challenge. Similarly, fish oil tended to reduce IL-1β production (P < 0.1) following the second challenge and IL-2 (P < 0.1) production following the first challenge in both challenged and unchallenged pigs compared with corn oil. In parallel in vitro experiments, peripheral blood lymphocytes of weanling pigs were incubated with various concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or linoleic acid (LA) (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 μg/ml). EPA, DHA and high levels of LA predominantly suppressed IL-1β (P < 0.05), IL-2 (P < 0.05) production and subsequent lymphocyte proliferation (P < 0.05). Low levels of LA increased (P < 0.05) IL-2 production. Compared with LA, EPA resulted in a stronger inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation (P < 0.05) and IL-2 (P < 0.01). and DHA resulted in a stronger inhibition of IL-1β (P < 0.05) and IL-2 (P < 0.01).

0344899147	Changes of CD8+CD28- T regulatory cells in rat model of colitis induced by 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene	AIM: To determine the changes of CD8+ T subsets especially CD8+CD28- T regulatory cells in rat model of experimental colitis induced by 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB). METHODS: The rat model of experimental colitis was induced by enema with DNFB. Ten days later, colonic intraepithelial and splenic lymphocytes were isolated from colitis animals (n=16) and controls (n=8). The proportion of CD8+ T cells, CD8+CD28+ T cells and CD8+CD28- T regulatory cells were determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The model of experimental colitis was successfully established by DNFB that was demonstrated by bloody diarrhea, weight loss and colonic histopathology. The proportion of CD8+ T cells in either splenic or colonic intraepithelial lymphocytes was not significantly different between colitis animals and controls (spleen: 34.6±7.24 % vs 33.5±9.41 %, colon: 14.0±8.93 % vs 18.0±4.06 %, P>0.05). ButCD8+CD28-T regulatory cells from colitis animals were significantly more than those from controls (spleen: 11.3±2.26 % vs 5.64±1.01 %, colon: 6.50±5.37 % vs 1.07±0.65 %, P<0.05). In contrast, CD8+CD28+ T cells from colitis animals were less than those from controls (spleen: 23.3±6.14 % vs 27.8±9.70 %, P=0.06; colon: 7.52±4.18 % vs l6.9±4.07 %, P<0.05). The proportion of CD8+CD28- T regulatory cells in splenic and colon intraepithelial CD8+ T cells from colitis animals was higher than that from controls (spleen: 33.3±5.49 % vs 18.4±7.26 %, colon: 46.0±14.3 % vs 6.10±3.72 %, P<0.005). CONCLUSION: Experimental colitis of rats can be induced by DNFB with simplicity and good reproducibility. The proportion of CD8+CD28- T regulatory cells in rats with experimental colitis is increased, which may be associated with the pathogenesis of colitis.

0344012477	Elevation of serum and ascites CA125 levels in liver cirrhosis	AIM: To evaluate the range of serum and ascitic cancer antigen(CA) 125 levels in patients with liver cirrhosis and to explore possible factors associated with CA 125 elevation. METHODS: A total of 70 patients were studied. Group I consisted of 30 patients with liver cirrhosis with or without ascites. Group II consisted of 30 patients with digestive malignant tumors with or without asictes. And group III consisted of 10 patents with benign (but not cirrhotic) asdtes. CA 125 levels were measured in sera of all the patients and also simultaneously in ascitic fluids of 15 patients. RESULTS: Serum CA125 levels in 87% patients from group I were elevated, especially in those with ascites (95% vs 38% in patients without ascites, P <0.01) irrespective of the etiology of cirrhosis. Serum CA 125 levels were correlated with Child-Pugh scores (r =0.38) but it was marginally significant (P =0.06). All the patients with ascites from group II and group III had elevated serum CA 125 levels. There was no difference in serum CA 125 levels among patients with ascites from group I (275±175 kU/L), group II (368±190 kU/L) and group III (396±287 kU/L), nelther did ascitic CA 125 levels (P >0.05), but serum CA 125 levels were significantly higher than those of patients without ascites from group I (72±83 kU/L) and group II (83±42 kU/L). The levels of serum CA 125 were lower than, but correlated with that of ascites CA 125 (198±108 kU/L vs 460±234 kU/L, r =0.58, P =0.026). The elevation of serum CA 125 in malignant ascites was more often accompanied with abnormalities of other tumor markers compared with that in benign ascites (90% vs 6%, P <0.01). Among the 38 patients with only serum CA125 elevation but not accompanied with a rise of other tumor markers, 36 (95%) were diagnosed as benign ascites. CONCLUSION: The elevation of serum CA 125 is common in liver cirrhosis patients. It is correlated with the amount of ascites, and possibly insufficiency of liver function. Serum CA 125 probably derives from ascites. It usually predicts benign disease if the elevation of serum or ascites CA 125 is not accompanied with a rise of other tumor markers.

84888249533	Relationship among symptoms, mucosal injury, and acid exposure in gastroesophageal reflux disease	Background Symptoms, endoscopy, and pH monitoring form the basis of diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Their relationship was meaningful for primary care physicians, but still unclear. Our research aimed to compare questionnaire, endoscopy, and pH monitoring and to analyze their correlations. Methods Three hundred patients who underwent the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ), endoscopy, and esophageal 24-hour pH monitoring from March 2007 to December 2010 in Peking University People's Hospital were enrolled. We analyzed the characteristics of different investigations and their relationships. Results Male (OR for mild reflux esophagitis (RE) = 2.433, severe RE = 8.386), body mass index (BMI) (OR for mild RE = 1.222, severe RE = 1.297), and hernia (OR for mild RE = 6.059, severe RE = 17.547), were found to be the risk factors for RE; age (OR=1.074) was correlated with severe RE. The consistency of questionnaire, endoscopy, and pH monitoring was poor: RDQ did not agree well with pH monitoring (κ=0.061), nor with endoscopy (κ=0.044); pH monitoring did not agree well with endoscopy (κ=0.316). However, the severity of mucosa injury in RE was associated with pathological acid exposure (PAE): reflux episodes of >5 minutes (P=0.035), the percentage time pH <4 (P=0.017), and the DeMeester score (P=0.016) increased significantly in patients with severe RE. Chest pain had poor relationship with RE or PAE. Conclusions Male, age, BMI, and hernia were probably risk factors for esophagitis. RDQ, endoscopy, and pH monitoring have their own focus and reinforce each other in diagnosis. Of the GERD symptoms, chest pain had negative correlation with RE or PAE.

84892571284	Spin-dependent Goos-Hänchen shift and spin beam splitter in gate-controllable ferromagnetic graphene	The transmission and Goos-Hänchen (GH) shift for charge carriers in gate-controllable ferromagnetic graphene induced by ferromagnetic insulator are investigated theoretically. Numerical results demonstrate that spin-up and spin-down electrons exhibit remarkably different transmission and GH shifts. The spin-dependent GH shifts directly demonstrate the spin beam splitting effect, which can be controlled by the voltage of gate. We attribute the spin beam splitting effect to the combination of tunneling through potential barrier and Zeeman interaction from the magnetic field and the exchange proximity interaction between the ferromagnetic insulator and graphene. In view of the spin beam splitting effect and the spin-dependent GH shifts, the gate-controllable ferromagnetic graphene might be utilized to design spin beam splitter. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84895921597	Dietary supplementation of aspartate enhances intestinal integrity and energy status in weanling piglets after lipopolysaccharide challenge	The intestine has a high requirement for ATP to support its integrity, function and health, and thus, energy deficits in the intestinal mucosa may play a critical role in intestinal injury. Aspartate (Asp) is one of the major sources of ATP in mammalian enterocytes via mitochondrial oxidation. We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of Asp could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced intestinal damage via modulation of intestinal energy status. Twenty-four weanling piglets were allotted to one of four treatments: (1) nonchallenged control, (2) LPS-challenged control, (3) LPS+0.5% Asp treatment, and (4) LPS+1.0% Asp treatment. On day 19, pigs were injected with saline or LPS. At 24 h postinjection, pigs were killed and intestinal samples were obtained. Asp attenuated LPS-induced intestinal damage indicated by greater villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio as well as higher RNA/DNA and protein/DNA ratios. Asp improved intestinal function indicated by increased intestinal mucosal disaccharidase activities. Asp also improved intestinal energy status indicated by increased ATP, ADP and total adenine nucleotide contents, adenylate energy charge and decreased AMP/ATP ratio. In addition, Asp increased the activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle key enzymes including citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Moreover, Asp down-regulated mRNA expression of intestinal AMP-activated protein kinase α1 (AMPKα1), AMPKα2, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC1α) and decreased intestinal AMPKα phosphorylation. These results indicate that Asp may alleviate LPS-induced intestinal damage and improve intestinal energy status. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84899965911	Aspartate alleviates liver injury and regulates mRNA expressions of TLR4 and NOD signaling-related genes in weaned pigs after lipopolysaccharide challenge	Pro-inflammatory cytokines play a critical role in many models of liver injury. In addition, aspartate (Asp) plays an important role in many biological and physiological processes including liver physiology. We hypothesized that Asp could alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced liver injury. Forty-eight weanling pigs were assigned to four treatments including: (1) non-challenged control; (2) LPS challenged control; (3) LPS+0.5% Asp; (4) LPS+1.0% Asp. After 20-d feeding with control (0% Asp), 0.5% or 1.0% Asp supplemented diets, pigs were injected with saline or LPS. At 4 (early phase) and 24 h (late phase) post-injection, blood and liver samples were obtained. Asp attenuated liver injury indicated by reduced serum aspartate aminotransferase activity and increased ratio of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase at 24 h, and less severe histological liver damage induced by LPS challenge at 4 or 24 h. In addition, Asp supplementation to LPS challenged pigs decreased mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and cyclooxygenase-2 linearly and quadratically at 4 h, and increased mRNA expressions of these pro-inflammatory mediators linearly and quadratically at 24 h. Finally, Asp decreased mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling related genes (TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, TNF-α receptor-associated factor (6), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein (NOD) signaling related genes (NOD1, NOD2 and receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2) and nuclear factor-κB p65 linearly or quadratically at 4 h. However, Asp increased mRNA expressions of these signaling molecules linearly or quadratically at 24 h. These results indicate that, at early and late phases of LPS challenge, Asp exerts opposite regulatory effects on mRNA expression of hepatic pro-inflammatory cytokines and TLR4 and NOD signalling related genes, and improves liver integrity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84903994972	A study to draw a normative database of laryngopharynx pH profile in Chinese	Background/Aims: To draw a normative database of laryngopharynx pH profile in Chinese subjects. Methods: Normal volunteers were recruited from "www.Ganji.com" and People's hospital between May 2008 and December 2009. The Restech pH Probes were calibrated in pH 7 and pH 4 buffer solutions according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each volunteer was asked to wear the device for a 24-hour period and was encouraged to participate in normal daily activities. Results: The healthy volunteers consisted of 20 males and 9 females with a median age of 23 years (interquartile range, 21 to 32 years). The 95th percentiles for % total times at pH < 4, pH < 4.5, pH < 5.0 and pH < 5.5 for the oropharynx pH catheter were 0.06%, 1.01%, 7.23% and 27.34%, respectively. The 95th percentile for number of reflux events within the 24-hour period at pH < 4, pH < 4.5, pH < 5.0 and pH < 5.5 were 2.0, 18.0, 107.5 and 284.5, respectively. Conclusions: This is the first study to systematically assess the degree of reflux detected by the new pH probe in healthy asymptomatic Chinese volunteers and to report normative values in Chinese people. Using an oropharyngeal pH catheter to monitor laryngopharyngeal reflux indicated that in healthy Chinese, reflux should be considered normal if the percent time at pH less than 4.5 is no more than 1%. © 2014 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility.

84905643492	Graphene spin diode: Strain-modulated spin rectification	Strain effects on spin transport in a ferromagnetic/strained/normal graphene junction are explored theoretically. It is shown that the spin-resolved Fermi energy range can be controlled by the armchair direction strain because the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field suppresses the current. The spin rectification effect for the bias reversal occurs because of a combination of ferromagnetic exchange splitting and the broken spatial symmetry of the junction. In addition, the spin rectification performance can be tuned remarkably by manipulation of the strains. In view of this strain-modulated spin rectification effect, we propose that the graphene-based ferromagnetic/ strained/normal junction can be used as a tunable spin diode. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84916876801	The opportunity and challenge for pharmacists in drug clinical trials	The globalization of clinical trials leads to an increasing number of international multi-center drug clinical trials and requires the trials to be designed more rigorous and complicated. Compared with clinical physicians, pharmacists hold specific characteristics in terms of comprehensive knowledge of drug usage, systemic framework of clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, as well as deep understanding of clinical trial regulations. For these characteristics, pharmacists could play a pivotal role during the clinical trials implementation. The participation of pharmacists who have pharmaceutical knowledge and are familiar with the policies and regulations of clinical trials can help ensure the quality and execution of clinical trials. This paper aims to analyze the role of pharmacists before, during, and after the clinical trials. Besides that, this paper would also discuss the opportunity and challenge for pharmacists in the regulation of drug clinical trials.
