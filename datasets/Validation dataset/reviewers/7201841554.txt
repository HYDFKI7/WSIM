1542290436	Paeonia saueri (Paeoniaceae), a new species from the Balkans	Paeonia saueri D. Y. Hong, X. Q. Wang et D. M. Zhang is described as a new species from Greece and Albania based on population sampling, statistics, chromosome observation, and SEM observations. It is characterized by tuberous roots, a high number of leaflets/segments, adaxially setulose along the veins on leaves, and a chromosome number of 2n = 20. It is closely related to P. peregrina. However, as shown by cluster analysis (Fig. 3) and principal coordinate analysis (Fig. 4), it differs distinctly from the latter in having mostly entire leaflets/segments that are hispidulous beneath, and red stigmas. From P. officinalis it differs in having the leaves setulose along the veins above and sparsely hispidulous below, and the stems, petioles and sepals always glabrous. Furthermore, it differs from those two species by its relatively short and wide follicles. The somatic chromosome number of the new species, 2n = 20, is reported here for the first time.

1542576289	Genetic diversity analysis by RAPD in Cathaya argyrophylla Chun et Kuang	Genetic diversity level of Cathaya argyrophylla was confirmed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Seventy five samples (individuals), collected from Hunan and Sichuan provinces of China were used in the study. 21 10-mer oligonucleotide primers detected 106 sites, and 34 (32%) of them were polymorphic . The level of genetic variation in C. argyrophylla was lower than those of other conifers, and was considered to be associated with the complexity of habitats. The percentages of polymorphic sites (PPS) in the Hunan and Sichuan populations were 18% and 25% respectively. 7.99% of genetic variation existed between the two populations; this value was higher than the mean value (6.8%) among populations in conifers displayed by allozyme. Some surpopulations of C. argyrophylla were greatly differentiated because of site mutation and genetic drift. The highest value of genetic difference between subpopulations amounted to 16.23%. In addition, a concept of diversity coefficient (DC), a value used to measure the genetic diversity level, and its calculation were proposed. The low genetic diversity level of C. argyrophylla was thought to be one of the factors causing its endangered status.

1842863541	Genetic variation in the endangered and endemic species Changium smyrnioides (Apiaceae)	Changium smyrnioides H. Wolff (Apiaceae) is an endangered plant endemic to Eastern China. Levels of genetic variation and patterns of population structure in C. smyrnioides were investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Of the 100 primers screened, 18 produced highly reproducible ISSR bands. Using these primers, 196 discernible DNA fragments were generated with 166 (84.7%) being polymorphic, indicating considerable genetic variation at the species level. In contrast, there were relatively low levels of polymorphism at the population level with the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) ranging from 29.6% to 36.2%. Genetic diversity within populations ranged from 0.10 to 0.13, averaging 0.24 at the species level. A high level of genetic differentiation among populations was detected based on Nei's genetic diversity analysis (52.9%), Shannon's index analysis (54.3%) and AMOVA analysis (52.3%). No significant statistical differences (analysis of molecular variance [AMOVA], P=0·6) in ISSR variation was found between regions. However, among populations (52.3% of the variance) and within populations (47.7% of the variance), there were significant differences (P<0.001). Restricted gene flow (Nm=0.446) among populations may result from several factors, such as low seed dispersal, isolation of populations and/or self-pollination. Limited gene flow among populations is a plausible reason for the high genetic differentiation observed for this species. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

21744436173	Notes on taxonomy of Paeonia sect. Moutan DC. (Paeoniaceae)	In this paper we argue for the specific status of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews, for the rationality of P. suffruticosa ssp. yinpingmudan D. Y. Hong, K. Y. Pan & Z. W. Xie and its wildness, and for the treatment of P. suffruticosa ssp. atava (Brühl) S. G. Haw & Lauener as a subspecies of P. rockii, P. rockii ssp. atava (Brühl) D. Y. Hong & K. Y. Pan. P. jishanensis T. Hong & W. Z. Zhao is justified as a legitimate name, while P. spontanea (Rehder) T. Hong & W. Z. Zhao is recognized as a superfluous name. Halda's four combinations and two new hybrid names in sect. Mouton DC. were treated as synonymy. As a result, one new combination is made and five new synonyms are proposed here in this paper.

21744439703	Restoration of the genus Amana Honda (Liliaceae) based on a cladistic analysis of morphological characters	Amana is a group in the Liliaceae (s.s.) confined to central and eastern China, Japan and Korean peninsula. This group is similar to Tulipa L. by having leaves 2-5 basal or cauline, flower usually solitary, erect, stamens 6, 3 longer, and anthers basifixed, but differs in having 2-3(-4) opposite or verticillate bracts at the upper part of the flowering stem and a longer style as long as ovary. It has long been in dispute if the Amana group should be included in the genus Tulipa or treated as an independent genus of its own. Based on both herbarium and field observations on the Chinese taxa of Tulipa (s.l.), particularly those in the Amana group, a cladistic analysis of 18 species (including 3 species from Turkey) of Tulipa was carried out in the present work. Twenty-eight morphological characters were used in unweighted pair-group method using the maximum parsimony (MP) tree construction executed with PAUP 4.0b4a program. The results show that Tulipa (s.l.) is not a monophyletic group but split into two clades: one is Amana group, and the other comprises Orithyia, Eriostemones, Leiostemones and Tulipanum. Our unpublished data of ITS and trnL-F sequences in 19 species representing five sections of Tulipa (s.l.) also show that sect. Tulipanum, sect. Leiostemones, sect. Eriostemones and sect. Orithyia form one clade, whereas the Amana group and Erythronium form another clade. The Amana group is thus better treated as an independent genus.

21744458632	Circumscription of Paeonia suffruticosa Andrews and identification of cultivated tree peonies	The cultivated tree peonies have long been scientifically called Paeonia suffruticosa. After "Feng Dan", a tree peony cultivated for medicinal purpose, was described as a new species, P. ostii, in 1992, the name P. suffruticosa is still used to represent all the cultivated "Mu Dan" used as ornamental purpose. As several new species or subspecies, i.e., P. rockii, P. jishanensis, P. qiui and P. suffruticosa ssp. yinpingmudan were described and recognized in the P. suffruticosa complex in the past decade, the polyphyly of the cultivated tree peonies has been proposed. Some authors even consider that "P. suffruticosa" is "a complex of several species in sect. Moutan". Based on a detailed review on the taxonomic history of the P. suffruticosa complex and extensive field investigation on both wild and cultivated tree peonies for many years, we conclude that the cultivated tree peonies are polyphyletic in origin and comprise several species. However, we must point out that P. suffruticosa is a legitimate specific name with a clear definition. It is a component of cultivated tree peonies, but surely not "a complex of several species". Because the cultivated tree peonies are polyphyletic in origin and comprise several species, we suggest that they should be identified based on morphological characters and then given correct names, but not be all referred to as P. suffruticosa in a simple way. The circumscription of P. suffruticosa is made clear in the present paper by citation of literature and specimens. In addition, P. yinpingmudan (D. Y. Hong, K. Y. Pan & Z. W. Xie) B. A. Shen is treated as a new synonym, and P. yinpingmudan (D. Y. Hong, K. Y. Pan & Z. W. Xie) B. A. Shen ssp. henanensis (D. Y. Hong, K. Y. Pan & Z. W. Xie) B. A. Shen is indicated as an illegitimate name.

0001090509	Preparation of DNA from silica gel dried mini-amount of leaves of Oryza rufipogon for RAPD study and total DNA bank construction	Gene resources of Oryza rufipogon Griff, play a crucial role in rice breeding, and hence to study their conservation is of utter importance. The authors describe a method for preparation of DNA from mini-amount of the silica-gel-dried leaves of Oryza rufipogon . The high molecular weight DNAs of 1 168 individuals representing 44 populations have been obtained with high yields, which could be used for RAPD PCR and construction of total DNA bank of this species. The template DNA from silica-gel-dried leaves stored for one year at room temperature gave the same RAPD results as that from the newly prepared silica-gel-dried leaves. The optional template DNA concentrations for amplification ranged from 3.1 ng to 50 ng. In addition, the quality and quantity of the template DNAs that affect RAPD results are also discussed.

0013425851	Genetic analysis of isozyme loci in Adenophora potaninii	Enzyme polymorphism in Adenophora potaninii Korsh. was investigated using vertical slab polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Genetic analysis of the population samples and the progeny of intraspecific crosses allowed the verification of the isozyme loci from eight enzyme systems. The system studies included aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). esterase (EST), formate dehydrogenase (FDH), glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malic enzyme (ME) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The results indicated that the eight enzyme systems are specified by at least 18 loci. 12 of which behaved as allozyme loci. Zymogram patterns showed that EST is monomeric and GDH is hexameric. AAT. FDH. IDH and SOD are apparently dimeric. The tissue and developmental variability are also discussed along with the genetic analysis of isozymes.

0001496456	Clonality in wild rice (Oryza rufipogon, Poaceae) and its implications for conservation management	Correlations were examined between habitat characters and clonal structures determined by the RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) assay in five populations of Oryza rufipogon in China. Nine of 175 decameric primers were used in the study because they reproducibly amplified polymorphisms. The extent of clonality together with the clonal and sexual reproductive strategies varied greatly among the five populations and correlated with the habitats where they occur. The populations under serious disturbance or seasonal drought tended to have small clones with relatively high clonal diversity caused by sexual reproduction, whereas the populations with little disturbance and sufficient supply of water were prone to have large clones with relatively low clonal variation and low sexual reproduction. Therefore, the dynamics of sexual vs. clonal reproduction of this species depended mainly on environmental factors, such as external disturbance and water supply, rather than latitudes indicated by previous study. These results have important implications for in situ conservation of O. rufipogon. Adequate external disturbance and water supply control are essential for maintaining high clone diversity of in situ conserved populations. According to the extent of clonality of the populations examined, we recommend that an interval of > 12 m should be required for collecting samples for ex situ conservation and for population genetic studies to capture possible genetic diversity for O. rufipogon in China.

0030322181	Comparative studies on pollination biology of Mosla hangchouensis and M. chinensis (labiatae)	Mosla hangchouensis Matsuda and M. chinensis Maxim. are sibling species. The former is endemic to the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, and the latter occupies southern China. Their morphological differences were associated with their different breeding systems indicated by pollen-ovule ratio (P/O). M. hangchouensis was predominantly outcrossing with P/O ranging from 756 to 6163 due to the variation among populations. Floral characters also showed that M. hangchouensis is an outcrosser: corolla tube 5∼10 mm long. 3∼5 mm wide, bright red; style 6∼15 mm long; stigma 1. 5∼2. 0 mm horizontally away from anthers. On the contrary. M. chinensis was predominantly a selfer with a low P/O ratio (P/O= 110). Its floral parameters contrasted sharply with M. hangchouensis: corolla tube 3. 0 mm long, 1. 0∼1. 5 mm wide, pale colored: style 2. 5 mm long, stigma close to or touching anthers. The pollinators of M. hangchouensis most frequently seen are: Bambus trifascitus Smith. , Scolia spp., Apis cerana Fabricius, Hylaeus sp. and Lasioglossum spp. These pollinators began to visit flowers at about 8 : 00 am, when flower buds were ready to open. When insects entered corolla tube for honey and (or) pollen, the stigmata touched the insects' body hairs to which pollen grains adhered, and pollen grains were transferred to the stigmata. Meanwhile the hairs collected pollen from anthers under the upper lips of corolla as the insects thrusted their bodies forward. Bumble bees and honey bees were considered more efficient pollinators because they were hair-rich and their body size fitted corolla tube fairly well. Due to the short flight distance of pollinators between two visits (average flight distances of honey bees and solitary bees were 0. 52 m and 0. 32 m respectively), pollen dispersal was probably restricted. Pollen vectors were important for the reproductive success of M. hangchouensis because 84. 3% of its seed-set depended on the pollinators' visitation. Although insects did pay visits to M. chinensis occasionally, such visitation was insignificant in seed-set due to cleistogamy. Discussions are made on the evolutionary significance of breeding system divergence between M. hangchouensis and M. chinensis, and the contribution of studies on pollination biology to conservation biology. Further studies are suggested for more thorough understanding of pollination biology of M. hangchouensis.

0031800966	Pollen morphology and its evolutionary significance in Hemerocallis (Liliaceae)	Pollen morphology of 10 species of Hemerocallis was investigated with LM and SEM. In addition to pollen with reticulate sexine, a new verrucate sexine pattern is found in three Chinese endemic species, H. plicata, H. forrestii and H. nana. Between the two typical sexine patterns, there are transitional variants. Also, a new pollen shape, boat-shaped-elliptic, is observed exclusively in H. nana, besides -oblong shape in other species. Phylogenetically, the common reticulate sexine pattern would be more primitive than the verrucate one. The typical reticulate sexine pattern would be basic, from which transitional variants would have derived and finally led to the typical verrucate pattern. Similarly, the common boat-shaped-oblong pollen would be more primitive than the -elliptic one, from which the latter would have derived during phylogenetic development.

The nutlet surface ornamentation of Mosla and Perilla is also unique. Both pollen and nutlet morphology suggest that Mosla and Perilla are the most closely related and highly specialized among these genera. The SEM examination of pollen and nutlet of Mosla provides no support to the sectional subdivision in this genus.

0031894103	Population genetic structure and conservation of an endangered conifer, Cathaya argyrophylla (Pinaceae)	Cathaya argyrophylla is an endangered conifer restricted to subtropical mountains of China, with total number of individuals less than 4,000. To assess levels and patterns of genetic diversity of C. argyrophylla, eight populations representing four widely separated regions were analyzed for allozyme variation, using 13 enzymes. In comparison with other coniferous species, C. argyrophylla possesses a low amount of variation, particularly at the population level (A = 1.38; P = 30.4; H(e) = 0.102). By contrast, the level of population differentiation is much higher (F(ST) = 0.441) compared to other conifers, and significant differentiation occurs both between regions and between populations within a region. Climate, geologic, and fossil data suggest that historical factors are mainly responsible for the unique population genetic structure in C. argyrophylla. These factors include severe bottleneck and subsequent genetic drift during Quaternary glaciations and habitat deterioration and fragmentation in postglaciation. In addition, reduced gene flow and relatively high rates of inbreeding may be factors that lead to low population variability and marked genetic differentiation among populations. Implications for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered species are discussed on the basis of these findings.

0032405494	A molecular systematic study of Cathaya, a relic genus of the Pinaceae in China	The systematic position of Cathaya, a relic genus of the Pinaceae, was discussed based on the rbcL gene sequence. The sequence data were analysed with PAUP and MEGA programs. The great genetic distance value between Cathaya and any other genus of the Pinaceae showed that Cathaya was a distinct and isolated genus. The most parsimonious Fitch tree and neighbor-joining tree showed that Cathaya was distantly related to the clade comprising Abies, Keteleeria, Pseudolarix and Tsuga, and a sister group relationship between Cathaya and Pinus was weakly supported. Pseudotsuga is closely related to Larix. In the Abies-Keteleeria-Pseudolarix-Tsuga clade, Abies has a close relationship to Keteleeria while Pseudolarix is relatively closely related to Tsuga.

Six cytotypes, AA, AB, BB, AAA, BBB, AABB were found. AAA was recorded for the first time in this complex and BBB was found for the first time on the continent. Most of the populations were composed of only one cytotype (AA, BB or AABB), while one mixed population of AA and AAA, one of AA and BB, one of BB, BBB and AABB, two of AA and AABB, and one of AA, AB and BB were recorded. AA occupies almost the entire range of this complex in China except the eastern part of Central China; BB occurs only in eastern Central China, while AABB spreads over the north of eastern Central China, the southeast in the Northeastern district and Taiwan. The distribution of cytotypes is mapped in this paper. In addition, the mean numbers of B-chromosomes per individual and percentages of individuals with B-chromosomes in each population were calculated. These measures are distinctly higher in BB cytotype than in AABB cytotypes, while it is the lowest in AA. The B-chromosome content of AA cytotype may be positively related to the latitude.

0032460944	PCR-RFLP analysis of the chloroplast gene trnK in the Pinaceae, with special reference to the systematic position of Cathaya	The molecular phylogeny of the Pinaceae represented by 13 species of 10 genera was constructed from PCR-RFLP analysis of the chloroplast gene trnK, which was approximately 2557 bp long. Ninety-two restriction sites, of which 68 were variable, were identified by 16 restriction enzymes. Thirty-five of the 68 polymorphic sites were phylogenetically informative. The restriction site data were analyzed by PAUP (version 3.1.1) with both the Wagner parsimony method and the Dollo parsimony method. As a result, Dollo and Wagner parsimonious trees have similar topologies except for the position of Cedrus. The Abies-Keteleeria-Tsuga-Pseudolarix clade was well resolved in all trees. Pseudotsuga is closely related to Larix, while Abies is relatively closely related to Keteleeria. As an isolated genus, Cathaya is distantly related to the Abies-Keteleeria-Tsuga-Pseudolarix clade, and is not very closely related to any other genus of the Pinaceae.

Method: HPLC was used. The contents of paeoniflorin and paeonol in 9 collected samples, 5 from F. ostii and 4 from P. suffruticosa, and 6 herb samples bought from different areas were analyzed. The rough contents of 3 paeonol similar compounds and 2 paeoniflorin similar compounds were investigated. Result and Conclusion : Circled digit one There is no obvious difference in the contents of paeonol and paeonoflorin and the constitution of other main compounds between P. ostii and P. suffruticosa. Since they belong to different botanic species, it is suggested that both P. ostii and P. suffruticosa should be recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia as the origin of Cortex Paeoniae. Cirlced digit two The glucosides of paeonol might change to paeonol in the course of the collecting and processing of the herb. Therefore when the contents of paeonol is used as the standard to evaluate the quality of the material and patent medicine, the attention should be paid to the transformation mentioned above.

28844494154	Genetic diversity of Mosla hangchouensis and M. chinensis (Labiatae)	Genetic diversity of Mosla hangchouensis Matsuda, a species endemic to eastern China and a closely related species M. chinensis Maxim, which is widely distributed throughout south part of China, was analysed by starch gel electrophoresis. Of seven populations of M. hangchouensis and three populations of M. chinensis examined, a low level of allozymic diversity was estimated based on 28 loci of 15 enzyme systems. The averages of A, P and He of seven populations in M. hangchouensis are 1.25, 21.43% and 0.082 respectively. The averages of genetic diversity of M. hangchouensis within and between populations are Hs = 0.0789, Ht = 0.1014, Gst = 0.2219. For M. chinensis, the estimates are A = 1.10, P = 9.52%, He = 0.021, Hs = 0.0201, Ht = 0.0450 and Gst = 0.5533. The relative richness of genetic diversity between M. hangchouensis and M. chinensis may be attributed to the difference in breeding systems, for M. chinensis is predominantly a selfer and may be of late origin due to the shift of breeding system. The allozymic diversity is roughly correlated with morphological diversity, but contradicts with the range of distribution. Of the limited diversity maitained by M. hangchouensis, component within population accounts for nearly 78% of the total. So an effort to conserve the genetic diversity not only should give the priority to the highly variable populations, but also should take the less variable populatons into consideration.

27744516277	Patterns of allozyme variation at two stages of the life history in wild rice Oryza rufipogon and conservation genetic implications	Oryza rufipogon Griff. occurs widely in aquatic ecosystem of tropics and subtropics of monsoon Asia as well as Southern China. It is a vital gene source for rice breeding programs. Many populations of the species, unfortunately, have drastically diminished because of the disappearance of aquatic habitats as a result of human disturbance. In order to determine patterns of genetic variation at two stages of the life-cycle in the wild rice species, we investigated allozyme variation of four natural populations in China. Two southern populations have significant asexual reproduction while two other northern marginal populations show a mixed reproduction in China. At 22 allozyme loci, a significantly lower genetic diversity was observed in the ratoons than in the seeds of the two southern populations, whereas a significantly higher genetic diversity was found in the ratoons than in the seeds of the two northern marginal populations. The results suggest that the variation of reproductive system is probably associated with their patterns of genetic variation in the species. Moreover, a significantly higher genetic differentiation among populations found in the ratoons than in the seeds may stem from pollen-mediated gene flow among them. Finally, we propose suggestions for conservation management of the endangered species. © Springer 2005.

31344479317	Genetic diversity in accessions of wild rice Oryza granulata from South and Southeast Asia	Oryza granulata, an upland wild rice species, represents an unique germplasm for possessing abilities of tolerance to shade and drought, immune to bacterial blight and resistance to brown planthopper. Although low degree of genetic variability has been revealed within its populations, little genetic information at the species level is available in determining rational conservation strategies. Here we used dominant DNA marker random amplified polymorphism DNA (RAPD) to assess the genetic variability among 23 accessions of O. granulata that collected from main distribution areas worldwide. Twenty decamer primers generated a total of 243 bands, with 83.5% of them (203 bands) being polymorphic. Calculation of Shannon index of diversity revealed an average value of 0.42 ± 0.25, indicating that O. granulata maintains a relatively high degree of genetic diversity on the species level. Analysis of genetic dissimilarity (GD) showed that genetic differentiation occurred among studied accessions, which supports the feasibility of current ex situ conservation strategies. We also suggested that information based on population studies, which could be achieved by international co-operation, is needed to conserve this widespread germplasm more effectively. © Springer 2006.

The peony in the Crimea of Ukraine and its allied populations have been variously taxonomically treated, as Paeonia daurica Andrews or P. mascula ssp. triternata (Pall. ex DC.) Stearn & P. H. Davis. Supported by the National Geographical Society, we have conducted extensive field observations and population sampling of this group in Turkey. In addition, relevant herbarium specimens from the herbaria B, BEO, BM, BUCA, E, G, GZU, K, P, SA, SOM, UPA, and WU were critically examined. Principal coordinate analysis was performed using MVSP-Version 3.13b analysis software. As a result, P. daurica was shown to be clearly differentiated from P. mascula in the number of leaflets/segments of the lower leaves and the shape of the terminal leaflets. P. daurica is diploid, except for three local tetraploids in the Caucasus, whereas P. mascula is consistently tetraploid. The two units were not found growing together, even in southern Turkey, where they are sympatric. P. daurica is considered to be a good species, which ranges from Croatia to Iran through Turkey and the Caucasus, and comprises six subspecies. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

Pan, a new tree peony, with revision of P. suffruticosa ssp. yinpingmudan	Molecular data and new additional morphological data suggest that the two tree peonies, based on which Paeonia suffruticosa ssp. yinpingmudan was described as new, belong to two entities, the one from Anhui (K. Y. Pan and Z. W. Xie 9701, the type) being a member of P. ostii, while the other from Song Xian, Henan Province (D. Y. Hong et al. H97010) being a new taxon. P. suffruticosa ssp. yinpingmudan is here reduced as a synonym of P. ostii, and P. cathayana D. Y. Hong & K. Y. Pan is described as new based on the specimen from Henan. The new species is closely related to P. ostii and P. jishanensis, but it differs from the former in having lower leaves with 9 leaflets and petals rose, while from the latter in having leaflets glabrous, ovate or ovate-lanceolate, less lobed, sepals all caudate at the apex and petals rose.

3743150789	ITS1 sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA in wild rices and cultivated rices of China and their phylogenetic implications	The first internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) of nuclear ribosomal DNA of three wild rice species and two subspecies of cultivated rice, which are distributed in China, was amplified using PCR technique and sequenced with automated fluorescent sequencing. The sequences of ITS1 ranged from 193 bp to 218 bp in size and G/C content varied from 69.3% to 72.7%. In pairwise comparisons among the five taxa, sequence site divergence ranged from 1.5% to 10.6%. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS1 sequences using Wagner parsimony generated a single well-resolved tree, which revealed that Oryza rufipogon was much more closely related to cultivated rice species than to the other two wild species. Oryza granulata was less closely related to either cultivated rice species or the other two wild species, and might be a unique and isolated taxon in the genus Oryza. The phylogenetic relationships of the three wild rice species and two cultivated rice subspecies inferred from ITS1 sequences is highly concordant with those based on the molecular evidence from isozyme, chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA) of the genus Oryza.

0033066466	Comparisons of genetic diversity in the endangered Adenophora lobophylla and its widespread congener, A. potaninii	Starch-gel electrophoresis was used to examine the levels and distribution of genetic diversity in two Adenophora species: the narrow endangered Adenophora lobophylla and its widespread congener, A. potaninii. Based on allozyme variation at 18 putative loci, we measured high levels of genetic variability both in the endangered and the widespread species, with 83.3% of the loci being polymorphic. The mean expected heterozygosity within populations (H(ep)) and within species (H(es)) were 0.234 and 0.244 for A. potaninii and were as high as 0.210 and 0.211 for A. lobophylla. There was higher differentiation among populations in A. potaninii (F(ST) = 0.155) than in A. lobophylla (F(ST) = 0.071). The high levels of genetic diversity in the present allozyme survey are consistent with the morphological variation observed in these species and may be attributed to high outcrossing rates in the Adenophora species. In addition, A. lobophylla was identified as a distinct species on the basis of Nei's genetic distances and thus should be given a high priority for protection. It is noteworthy that the endangered A. lobophylla maintains much higher genetic diversity than most endemic or narrowly distributed plant species in spite of its restricted distribution. We hypothesize that A. lobophylla has become endangered for ecological and stochastic reasons, including habitat destruction or environmental changes, mud slides, and human disturbance such as grazing and mowing. Consequently, habitat protection is of particular importance for conserving this endangered species.

0032725299	Allozyme variation in the diploid (A genome) populations of Scilla scilloides (Hyacinthaceae)	Allozyme variation at eleven loci encoding seven enzyme systems were examined in 20 populations of diploid (genome AA, 2n= 16) Scilla scilloides in China. In comparison with the average species of seed plants studied, populations of this species display a high amount of genetic variation (A = 2.0, P = 58.6%, H(o) = 0.172, and H(e) = 0.185). Allozyme variation pattern revealed predominant outcrossing within populations and considerable differentiation (F(ST)=0.314) among populations as well as between the subtropic and temperate regions. The wide distribution, long existence and outcrossing are presumably the main factors responsible for the high genetic diversity within populations. But the gravity dispersal of seeds and pollination by small insects set limits to the increase of genetic variation within populations and promote differentiation between populations and regions. In addition, allozyme variation does not distinguish S. scilloides var. albo-viridis and suggests that subtropic populations may be considered as a genetic entity.

0033452726	Phylogeny of rice genomes with emphasis on origins of allotetraploid species	The rice genus, Oryza, which comprises 23 species and 9 recognized genome types, represents an enormous gene pool for genetic improvement of rice cultivars. Clarification of phylogenetic relationships of rice genomes is critical for effective utilization of the wild rice germ plasm. By generating and comparing two nuclear gene (Adh1 and Adh2) trees and a chloroplast gene (matK) tree of all rice species, phylogenetic relationships among the rice genomes were inferred. Origins of the allotetraploid species, which constitute more than one-third of rice species diversity, were reconstructed based on the Adh gene phylogenies. Genome types of the maternal parents of allotetraploid species were determined based on the matK gene tree. The phylogenetic reconstruction largely supports the previous recognition of rice genomes. It further revealed that the EE genome species is most closely related to the DD genome progenitor that gave rise to the CCDD genome. Three species of the CCDD genome may have originated through a single hybridization event, and their maternal parent had the CC genome. The BBCC genome species had different origins, and their maternal parents had either a BB or CC genome. An additional genome type, HHKK, was recognized for Oryza schlechteri and Porteresia coarctata, suggesting that P. coarctata is an Oryza species. The AA genome lineage, which contains cultivated rice, is a recently diverged and rapidly radiated lineage within the rice genus.

0032882761	A revision of the Paeonia suffruticosa complex (Paeoniaceae)	The taxonomical concept of the Paeonia suffruticosa complex i.e. Sect. Moutan Subsect. Vaginatae, has changed greatly since 1990. Six species and four subspecies have been described as new and two subspecies raised to specific level. Five species and two subspecies are recognized in the present revision, viz. P. suffruticosa subsp. suffruticosa and subsp. yinpingmudan, P. jishanensis, P. qiui, P. ostii, P. rockii subsp, rockii and subsp. taibaishanica. P. yananensis, P. ridleyi, P. spontanea, P. moutan subsp, atava, P. suffruticosa subsp. atava, P. rockii subsp. linyanshanii and P. ostii var. lishizhenii are treated as synonyms. P. papaveracea and P. baokangensis are proposed to be interspecific hybrids. A key to the recognized species and subspecies is provided. Biological features of the species are described and their distributions are mapped. The relationships between species are inferred and the origins of commonly cultivated tree peonies (P. suffruticosa and P. ostii) are discussed.

0032986609	RAPD variation within and between natural populations of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon from China and Brazil	Genetic variation within and between eight natural populations of Oryza rufipogon from China and Brazil was investigated at the DNA level by analysis of RAPD fragments. Out of 60 random primers, which were initially screened against DNA from four individuals, 20 generated highly reproducible RAPD fragments which were then used for further population analysis. With these primers, 95 discernible DNA fragments were produced and 78 (82.1%) were polymorphic, which indicated that high levels of genetic variation existed in these natural populations. In addition, the Chinese populations showed greater polymorphism than those from Brazil at both the population and regional levels. This is noteworthy considering that the Chinese populations are from a relatively restricted area of China. The factors responsible for these findings include the contrasting mating systems in the Brazilian and Chinese populations, and gene flow from annual cultivated rice to perennial natural populations in China. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation between individuals within populations, between populations within regions, and between regions. Results showed that 61.8% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two continents, whereas only 14.9% and 23.3% was attributable to population differences within regions and to individual differences within a population, respectively. The great genetic differentiation between the Chinese and Brazilian populations is in agreement with recent treatment of the American form of O. rufipogon as a separate species, O. glumaepatula.

0032992107	Pollination biology of Paeonia jishanensis T. Hong and W.Z. Zhao (Paeoniaceae), with special emphasis on pollen and stigma biology	The endangered wild tree peony. Paeania jishanensis T. Hong and W.Z. Zhao (formerly P. suffruticosa Andr. ssp. spontanea (Rehd.) S.G. Haw and L.A. Lauener) is one of the most important ancestral stocks of cultivated tree peony, P. suffruticasa Andr. Study of the natural population at Jishan, Shanxi Province revealed that the seed set was very low (2.1 seeds per carpel). The low seed set should not be attributed to viable pollen limitation because the plant produces a great quantity of pollen and 36-75% of pollen is TTC-tested viable. Stigmas became receptive almost one day after the flower opened, and receptivity lasted for several days. All the stigmas were sufficiently pollinated, and pollen germinated readily on the wet crest of stigmas irrespective of whether cross pollen or self pollen was used. Hand-pollination showed that this plant was self-incompatible. No seed was harvested after self-pollination, while cross-pollination yielded 2.4 seeds per carpel. Many pollen tubes were recorded in the stigma but extremely few in the ovary chamber. This phenomenon indicated that the self-incompatible system was activated when pollen tubes reached the ovary wall.

0033759601	Allozyme diversity and population genetic structure of Pinus densata Master in Northwestern Yunnan, China	We investigated the levels and patterns of genetic diversity of Pinus densata Master in Yunnan. Horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis was performed on macrogametophytes collected from nine populations in northwestern Yunnan, China. Compared with other gymnosperm species, P. densata has higher mean values for all measures of genetic diversity. Allozyme polymorphism (0.99 criterion) was 97.0% and 71.4% at the species and population levels, respectively. The average number of alleles per locus was 3.1 and 2.0 at the species and population levels. Mean expected heterozygosity was substantially higher in P. densata than average values investigated for other gymnosperms both at the population (H(ep) = 0.174±0.031) and at the species (H(es) = 0.190) levels. Of the total genetic variation, less than 12% was partitioned among populations (G(ST) = 0.112). Our allozyme survey supports the suggestion that the observed higher diversity in P. densata may be attributed partly to its hybrid origin between two genetically distinct species, P. yunnanensis and P. tabulaeformis. In addition, we suggest that introgression would give rise to the increase in genetic diversity occurring in P. densata.

Hong from Gansu is described and illustrated. According to an analysis of the distribution and main characters of 21 taxa of Campanula indigenous to China, C. gansuensis is a distinct species in sect. Campanula. Based on the reflexed appendage in each sinus of the calyx, it is somewhat similar to C. punctata Lam. and C. sibirica L., but differs in its annual habit and small green corolla. It is very rare and only found in Mayanhe, a village in the mountains of Hui Xian, in the West Qinling mountains of Gansu province, at ca. 1,100 m elevation. A key is provided to aid in the identification of the 22 taxa of Campanula in China.

0033822851	Spatial autocorrelation of genetic variation in three stands of Ophiopogon xylorrhizus (Liliaceae s.l.)	Using spatial autocorrelation analysis, the spatial distribution of genotypes and gene frequencies at three allozyme loci, as well as the spatial distribution of family outcrossing rates were investigated in three stands of the tropical rainforest endangered perennial Ophiopogon xylorrhizus in Southwest China. Similar spatial patterns of the different allozymes were found both in individual stands and among stands, particularly at the whole distance classes. There were slightly different associations between like-homozygous and like-heterozygous plants. Most like-homozygous plant pairs exhibited a significant positive autocorrelation in shorter distance classes, and a random distribution or slightly negative autocorrelation in the following one or two distance classes. In contrast, a significant positive autocorrelation was found in the last one or two distance classes, indicating that like-homozygous plants were clustered in patches with a diameter of 5-10 m. Most like-heterozygous plant pairs exhibited a random distribution or a slightly negative autocorrelation in shorter distance classes, a significantly positive autocorrelation in the next one or two distance classes, and tended to a random distribution in the last one or two distance classes. Fifty-five per cent of unlike-homozygous plant pairs existed in different patches with similar patch sizes and these patches did not overlap. Highly consistent patterns were found in the spatial distribution of gene frequencies. Different genes existed in different patches, with a highly consistent average patch size in all three stands. Family outcrossing rates were randomly distributed in space. These results imply that it is not possible to sample the genetic variation of a population by merely conserving one part of it because the population is unlikely to be homogenous.

0033859682	Low levels of genetic diversity within populations and high differentiation among populations of a wild rice, Oryza granulata Nees et Arn. Ex Watt., From China	To characterize genetic diversity within and among populations of Oryza granulata Nees et Arn. ex Watt., allozyme variation was assayed for 17 loci in 15 natural populations from Hainan and Yunnan provinces, China, using starch gel electrophoresis. A low level of genetic variability within populations (the mean A = 1.09, p = 6.33%, H(e) = 0.016, and H(o) = 0.009), but high genetic differentiation (F(ST)) among populations was observed. The low amount of genetic variability of the species may be strongly affected by founder effect because of the marginal nature of the populations in China. The results also indicate that the restricted gene flow occuring between the two regions as well as the characteristics of O. granulata as a colonizing plant species are probably of significance in shaping the observed population genetic structure. Finally, an appropriate strategy for sampling more populations, but fewer individuals within populations, was proposed for the conservation of O. granulata in China.

0033861051	Embryology of Crawfurdia delavayi (Gentianaceae) and its systematic value	The embryological characters of Crawfurdia delavayi Frabnch. are described and the systematic relationships of Crawfurdia discussed. Anthers are tetrasporangiate. The development of anther walls conforms to the Dicotyledonous type. The tapetum is of single origin. The development of the tapetum with uninucleate cells is of the glandular type. The tapetal cells on the connective side show radial elongation or periclinal division and intrude into the anther locule. The epidermis of anther walls persists and its cells become pillar and fibrous, and the endothecium degenerates. The ovary is bicarpellary and unilocular. The placentation is typically parietal with 8 rows of anatropous ovules. The development of embryo sac is of the polygonum type. Before fertilization, two polar nuclei fuse into a secondary nucleus. Three antipodal cells persist. Flowers are protandrous. Fertilization is porogamous. The development of the endosperm is of the nuclear type. The embryogeny corresponds to the solanad type physalis II variation. The embryological data indicate that it is better to separate Crawfurdia from Gentiana as an independent genus.

0034887371	Differentiation and inter-genomic relationships among C, E and D genomes in the Oryza officinalis complex (Poaceae) as revealed by multicolor genomic in situ hybridization	The multicolor genomic in situ hybridization (McGISH) method was used to study differentiation and relationships among the C, D and E genomes in the officinalis complex of the genus Oryza. The chromosomes of Oryza alta (CCDD genomes) were hybridized with labelled probes of the C genome (from diploid Oryza eichingeri and Oryza officinalis) and the E genome (from Oryza australiensis) simultaneously. By adjusting the post-hybridization washing stringency in a gradual series, differentiation between the genomes was detected according to the homology between the target genomes and the probes. The McGISH results indicate that the C, D and E genomes share a substantial amount of similar sequences, and differentiation between the D and C genomes of O. alta is less than that between the E genome and each of the C and D genomes. The differentiation within the C genomes of the diploid species (O. officinalis and O. eichingeri) and the C genome of O. alta was clearly discerned by McGISH, suggesting strongly that neither O. officinalis nor O. eichingeri was the direct C-genome donor of O. alta. The evidence of the GISH results also indicates that the E genome was considerably differentiated from the C and D genomes. Therefore, the E genome should not be the direct donor of O. alta; on the contrary, the E genome is closer to the C than to the D genome. McGISH is an efficient method in revealing the relationships among the genomes in question, particularly under the gradual stringent-washing condition.

0034888294	Identification of genome constitution of Oryza malampuzhaensis, O. minuta, and O. punctata by multicolor genomic in situ hybridization	Multicolor genomic in situ hybridization (McGISH) was applied to identify the genomic constitution of three tetraploid species (2n = 4x = 48) in the Oryza officinalis complex of the genus Oryza, i.e. Oryza malampuzhaensis, Oryza minuta, and Oryza punctata. The genomic probes used were from three diploids, i.e. Oryza officinalis (CC), Oryza eichingeri (CC) and Oryza punctata (BB), respectively. The results indicated that all three tetraploids are allotetraploid with the genomic constitution of BBCC, and among them the genome constitution of O. malampuzhaensis was verified for the first time. Restoration of the independent taxonomic status of O. malampuzhaensis is suggested. One pair of satellite chromosomes belonging to the B genome was identified in O. malampuzhaensis, but no such satellite chromosomes were found in either O. minuta or the tetraploid O. punctata. The average chromosome length of the C genome was found to be slightly larger than that of the B-genome chromosomes of O. minuta, but not in the tetraploids O. punctata and O. malampuzhaensis. McGISH also revealed that the B genome of O. minuta and the B genome of diploid O. punctata showed clear differentiation from each other. Therefore, the suggestion was proposed that the B genome in diploid O. punctata was not the source of the B genome of O. minuta. The present results proved that multicolor GISH had high resolution in identifying the genomic constitution of polyploid Oryza species.

0034592989	A study on AFLP fingerprinting of land races of Panax ginseng L	Objective: To obtain more information on DNA fingerprintings of five land races of Chinese ginseng, namely, Damaya (DMY), Changbo (CB), Yuanbangyuanlu (YBYL) and Huangguo (HG). Moth-ods: The five land races were detected by amplified restriction fragment polymorphism (AFLP) markers with 11 combined primers (M2, M3, M16, M20, M53, M56, M57, M68, M69, M72, M84 in Mse I). Result and Conclusion: Only 4.6% polymorphic sites was found. It was further verified that only a little diversity existed amoung the land races. The polymorphic sites of CB were much more than those of the others, which suggests that there are more heterozygotes in CB populations, and it is closer to wild ginseng than the others.

0034929465	Cytogeography and taxonomy of the Paeonia obovata polyploid complex (Paeoniaceae)	The taxonomy of the Paeonia obovata polyploid complex in E-Asia has been controversial with treatments ranging from one species and two varieties to five species and numerous infraspecific taxa. Extensive observations in the field, analysis of morphological characters based on 32 populations sampled, and the examination of a large amount of herbarium specimens show that all the characters used by previous authors for distinguishing the species are variable between or even within populations: Leaf position, petal colour, stamen number (from 21 to 110 in the red-flowered and from 58 to 239 in the white-flowered form), filament and anther colour, style length as well as follicle number and position. Therefore, all these characters are of no value for species delimitation. However, an extensive chromosome survey and the analysis of morphological characters show that the ploidy level is basically correlated with the geographical distribution and with the indumentum on the lower leaf surface. Thus, the recognition of one species with two subspecies is proposed: Paeonia obovata subsp. obovata, mostly diploid, widely distributed in the north, east and south of the distribution range and glabrous to sparsely pubescent or hirsute on the lower leaf surface, and subsp. willmottiae, tetraploid, limited to the west and with leaves densely hirsute or pubescent below.

4344584543	The historical evolutionary development of Hemerocallis middendorfii (Hemerocallidaceae) revealed by non-coding regions in chloroplast DNA	A procedure in which combined molecular phylogeographical analyses among populations of Hemerocallis middendorfii (Hemerocallidaceae, Asparagales) were applied allowed comparisons to be made with the geological history. Information on geographical areas in which synapomorphic mutations occurred was used in molecular phylogeographical analyses for the first time in this study, in addition to molecular maximum-parsimonious analyses and TCS analyses. Nucleotide sequences of the intergenic region between the rbcL and atpB genes and the trnL (UAA) intron in chloroplast DNA were analyzed for 28 Japanese and three Chinese populations of H. middendorfii, 10 populations of closely related species and four outgroup species. The data of the three analyses in general agreed with one another and indicated that the separation of this species had proceeded in conjunction with the geological vicariance or orogeny. Where the synapomorphic mutations occurred, three patterns were recognized. They correlated with the geological history, namely, the age when the Japanese Archipelago and the Continent had joined, when the Sea of Japan was formed, and when there was separation from the Continent and the formation of each of the islands in the Japanese Archipelago. It was suggested that ancestors of H. middendorfii originated at latest 25 million years ago when the Japanese Archipelago and the Continent had joined; that is, before the formation of the Sea of Japan. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

Anderson complex (Paeoniaceae) and its allies	The previous taxonomic treatments of Paeonia arietina (= P. mascula subsp. arietina) and studies on relationships with its allies are reviewed. As a result of examination of a large number of herbarium specimens, extensive field observations, population sampling in the Mediterranean region, Turkey and the Balkan, and subsequent analysis, the P. arietina-P. parnassica group is found to be distinct from P. mascula in having tuberous roots, hirsute stems, petioles and sepals, and leaves that are mostly densely villose beneath. Our morphological and molecular data indicate that the P. arietina-P. parnassica group is most closely related to the P. officinalis group. These two groups are clearly separated from each other by differences in the indumentum of the sepals and stems, and in the shape, number and indumentum of the leaflets/segments. Paeonia parnassica is distinguished from P. arietina mainly by the dark purple petals (vs. pink or red) and purple anthers (vs. yellow). Paeonia officinalis subsp. banatica can not be clearly distinguished from P. officinalis subsp. officinalis. As a result, P. arietina and P. parnassica are recognized at specific rank, whilst P. officinalis subsp. banatica is retained as a subspecies.

65249095491	Further research on chemotaxonomy of paeonol and analogs, in Paeonia (Ranunculaceae)	In this paper, the paeonol, paeoniflorin and their analogs were analyzed in the roots of 14 species and 2 subspecies of Paeonia L. The existence and content of these compounds were discussed in three sections, sect. Moutan, sect. Paeonia and sect. Onaepia. Insect. Moutan, paeonol and its analogs were high in content in all species. In sect. Paeonia, low content of paeonol and its analogs were found in plants of four taxa, P. lactiflora, P. anomala ssp. veitchii, P. mairei and P. intermedia. None of these compounds was found in sect. Onaepia. Paeonol has a simple structure and is distributed widely in plant; its decrease and loss may be the result of evolution. Therefore, it is deduced that the relationship among the three sections of Paeonia might be that woody sect. Moutan is the more primitive and derived from the ancestor of Paeonia first. For the herbaceous sections, sect. Paeonia is more closely related to sect. Moutan than to sect. Onaepia. In sect. Moutan, there are less paeonol and its analogs in the species of subsect. Vaginata than in those of subsect. Delavayanae. Thus, the former may be considered more advanced. In sect. Paeonia, the taxa with minor content of paeonol and its analogs are diploid except P. mairei. Among them, P. lactiflora and P. anomala ssp. veitchii are relatively primitive by morphology. None of paeonol and its analogs was detected in the species with specialized form.

70349989693	Microsporogenesis and meiotic behavior in nine species of the genus Pinus	The meiotic behavior of 10 taxa (nine species and one variety) of the genus Pinus was investigated using pollen mother cells (PMCs) to reveal the differentiation among karyotypes. Chromosome spreads were prepared by conventional squashing. The meiotic index and the average configuration were higher, whereas the frequency of aberrance (chromosomal bridges, fragments, or micronuclei) was lower, in all 10 taxa compared with other gymnosperms. The meiotic index, average configuration, and frequency of irregularity were found to be uniform among the species. It was shown that the genomes of the Pinus species investigated were highly stable, confirming results of previous mitotic analyses in this genus. However, slight differentiation of homologous chromosomes among genomes was revealed by analysis of meiotic configurations in Pinus nigra var. poiretiana. Quadrivalents were observed in 9.31% of PMCs in this species. This is the first time that quadrivalents have been observed in gymnosperms. © 2009 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

0035092622	Genetic variation within and among populations of a wild rice Oryza granulata from China detected by RAPD and ISSR markers	Genetic variation within and between five populations of Oryza granulata from two regions of China was investigated using RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeat amplification) markers. Twenty RAPD primers used in this study amplified 199 reproducible bands with 61 (30.65%) polymorphic; and 12 ISSR primers amplified 113 bands with 52 (46.02%) polymorphic. Both RAPD and ISSR analyses revealed a low level of genetic diversity in wild populations of O. granulata. Furthermore, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was used to apportion the variation within and between populations both within and between regions. As the RAPD markers revealed, 73.85% of the total genetic diversity resided between the two regions, whereas only 19.45% and 6.70% were present between populations within regions and within a population respectively. Similarly, it was shown by ISSR markers that a great amount of variation (49.26%) occurred between the two regions, with only 38.07% and 12.66% between populations within regions and within a population respectively. Both the results of a UPGMA cluster, based on Jaccard coefficients, and pairwise distance analysis agree with that of the AMOVA partition. This is the first report of the partitioning of genetic variability within and among populations of O. granulata at the DNA level, which is in general agreement with a recent study on the same species in China using allozyme analysis. Our results also indicated that the percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) detected by ISSR is higher than that detected by RAPD. It seems that ISSR is superior to RAPD in terms of the polymorphism detected and the amplification reproducibility.

The sample collected from the nine large subpopulations in 1980 showed the highest levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.27, P = 18.20%, Ho = 0.042 and He = 0.049) and a slight deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 0.143), the sample from five moderate ones in 1985 displayed medium levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.14, P = 13.60%, Ho = 0.008 and He = 0.049) and a great deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 0.837), and the sample from two small ones in 1994 demonstrated the lowest levels of genetic diversity (A = 1.09, P = 9.10%, Ho = 0.000 and He = 0.043) and the largest deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectation (F = 1.000). The results not only documented the genetic erosion stemmed from the extinction of the subpopulations, but also revealed the drastic change of the population genetic structure due to the reduction of the population. Finally, some conservation strategies for the population are proposed.

0034850965	Further evidence for paraphyly of the Celtidaceae from the chloroplast gene matK	Based on the chloroplast matK gene sequence, a phylogenetic analysis of the Urticales in its traditional circumscription and its putative affinities produced three equally most parsimonious trees with tree length = 1527 steps, CI = 0.6863 and RI = 0.6352, indicating that the Ulmaceae s. 1. are polyphyletic while the Celtidaceae are paraphyletic, and particularly, Cannabis and Humulus in the Cannabaceae are consistently nested within the Celtidaceae. Therefore, the present data strongly suggest that the Cannabaceae should be merged with the Celtidaceae to form a monophyletic group. According to the present study, the Celtidaceae including Cannabaceae are more closely related to the Moraceae and Urticaceae than to the Ulmaceae s. str.. Gironniera and Aphananthe are both basal clades of the Celtidaceae rather than members of Ulmaceae s. str.. The Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae are the closest relatives of the traditional Urticales, which is very congruent with the newest system of flowering plants put forward by APG.

78649563817	Biosystematic studies on Adenophora potaninii korsh. complex (Campanulaceae) V. A taxonomic treatment	Adenophora is an extremely variable genus, and its taxonomy is very controversial. Of the genus, Adenophora potaninii complex, including A. potaninii, A. bockiana, A. wawreana, A. lobophylla, A. biformifolia, A. polydentata, and A. wawreana var. lanceifolia, is a typical group with different taxonomical treatments due to high level of morphological diversity.We carried out extensive biosystematic studies based on population sampling, transplantation experiments and offspring tests, cluster analysis, and a crossing experiment. The results reveal four main findings. (i) Leaf forms of the A. potaninii complex were extremely polymorphic; the leaf form of A. potaninii and A. bockiana, and that of A. wawreana and A. biformifolia could be found, respectively, on a single population or among the offsprings of a single plant. (ii) Cluster analysis and a crossing experiment indicated that A. bockiana and A. polydentata could not be separated from A. potaninii, nor A. biformifolia from A. wawreana. (iii) Adenophora potaninii and A. wawreana were gradational in morphology and their compatibility value was slightly reduced compared to that within each entity. (iv) Adenophora lobophylla was distinct from the other members of the complex in shape and size of corolla, relative length of style, and shape of capsule. This species was incompatible reproductively with the other members of the complex, but partly compatible with A. stenanthina, a species in another section. Therefore, we recognized only one species with two subspecies in the complex, A. potaninii subsp. potaninii and subsp. wawreana, moved A. lobophylla out of the complex, and reduced all the other names as new synonyms. © 2010 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

79751484210	Character analysis and taxonomic revision of the Microtoena insuavis complex (Lamiaceae)	The taxonomy of the Microtoena insuavis complex (Lamiaceae) is controversial. No agreement on the taxonomic treatments of M. esquirolii, M. insuavis, M. mollis and M. patchoulii has been reached. In addition, some species and varieties described on the basis of a single specimen or a limited number of specimens are doubtful. Based on the examination of a large number of herbarium specimens, extensive field observations, population sampling, scanning electron microscopy observation and statistical analysis of some characters, M. esquirolii is separated from the M. insuavis complex, and M. subspicata and M. subspicata var. intermedia are treated as synonyms of M. esquirolii, M. pauciflora is treated as a synonym of M. patchouli, and M. siamica is treated as a synonym of M. insuavis. Only three species (M. insuavis, M. mollis and M. patchouli) are recognized in this complex. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London.

0036017137	Maternal lineages of Pinus densata, a diploid hybrid	Previous morphological, allozyme and chloroplast DNA data have suggested that Pinus densata originated through hybridization between P. tabuliformis and P. yunnanensis. In the present study, sequence and restriction site analyses of maternally inherited mitochondrial nad1 intron were used to detect variation patterns in 19 populations of P. tabuliformis, P. yunnanensis and P. densata. A total of three mitotypes (A, B, C) were detected. All but one of the populations of P. yunnanensis possessed mitotype B while all populations of P. tabuliformis had mitotype A. Pinus densata populations, on the other hand, harboured both mitotypes A and B, which are characteristic of P. tabuliformis and P. yunnanensis, respectively. This result gives strong additional evidence supporting the hybrid origin of this diploid pine. The distribution of mitotypes indicated very different mating compositions and evolutionary history among P. densata populations. It seems that local founder populations and backcrosses may have played important roles in the early establishment of P. densata populations. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau had a significant impact on the distribution of maternal lineages of P. densata populations.

0035543150	Rapid and reliable identification of rice genomes by RFLP analysis of PCR-amplified Adh genes	The rice genus (Oryza L.) consists of 24 species with 10 recognized genome types. With the realization of many useful genes in species of wild rice, continuous efforts have been made to understand their genomic composition and relationships. However, the identification of rice genomes has often been difficult owing to complex morphological variation and formation of allotetraploids. Here we propose a rapid and reliable method for identifying rice genomes based on the restriction sites of PCR-amplified Adh genes. The experimental procedure was as follows: (i) amplify a portion of Adh1 and Adh2 genes with the locus-specific PCR primers; (ii) digest PCR products with restriction enzymes that distinguish different genomes; and (iii) run the digested products on 1.4% agarose gel, and photograph. Using various combinations of restriction digestion of the two Adh genes, all of the rice genomes can be identified.

0035732182	Distribution and conservation of an endangered wild rice Oryza granulata in China	Nearly Twenty years after the first large-scale field survey on wild rice in China during 1978-1982, we have recently made an extensive survey on Chinese Oryza granulata (Nees et Arn. Ex Watt.), including its current distribution, population characteristics and status of endagerment. Because of the change in the division of administrative areas, the number of countries or cities where the wild rice grows has reached up to 30. Oryza granulata grows normally under the coverage of 90% - 210% in the tropical forest with resistance to drought and moderate disturbance. The measurement of aggregation showed that it maintains a colony pattern in the community. Oryza granulata scatters seeds mainly by gravity and animals, causing limited scale of gene flow between local populations and attaining a typical metapopulation structure of the distributional pattern. Our survey revealed that 12.9% of the populations had been extinct, and 83.9% were endangered. The extent of disturbance varied in different areas. Up to date, the majority of the populations grow in the mountainous areas of southwestern Hainan and drainage area of Nanding river, Lancang river of Yunnan, under the threat of human activity. A total DNA bank was established that consists of 1 109 individuals from 49 populations. In the practice of conservation, difficulties such as lacking immediate utility and scattered distribution impeded the conservation efficient. However, owing to its characteristics of population genetics, sustainable and ex situ conservation strategies are appropriate in some places to salvage this important rice germplasm.

0036309304	Allozyme variation and conservation genetics of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) in Yunnan, China	In order to reveal levels and distribution of genetic variation within Oryza rufipogon Griff. of Yunnan, China, where one of the centers of genetic diversity for Asian cultivated rice O. sativa L. is located, allozyme variation encoded by 22 loci was electrophoretically analyzed in 149 individuals of all three existing populations as well as five from other regions (Guangxi, Hainan and Jiangxi provinces) of China. As compared to the level of genetic diversity (the mean A = 1.2, P = 24.1%, Ho = 0.045 and He = 0.079) for the populations from other regions, a rather low genetic diversity (the mean A = 1.1, P = 7.6%, Ho = 0.007 and He = 0.011) was found in Yunnan, which may originate from marginal nature of these populations, recent reduction of populations and consequent drift. The result suggests that the current center of genetic diversity for O. rufipogon fail to agree with that for cultivated rice in China. The genetic differentiation for all the eight populations (F

0036360580	Patterns and significance of floral development in Whytockia (Gesneriaceae)	The floral development of Whytockia W. W. Smith has been studied in order to explore the developmental basis for the arrangement and differentiation patterns of floral organs, and the evolutionary relationship between Whytockia and allies in floral development. The descending imbricate aestivations in both calyx and corolla have remarkably different ontogenetic patterns between calyx and corolla which are derivative with respect to the development of the valvate aestivations in the four-stamened Rhynchoglossum. Both corolla lobes and stamens are initiated simultaneously from the same ring meristem. However, the five stamens remarkably precede the initiation of the five corolla lobes. Also, the adaxial stamen is suppressed after initiation to become a staminode, concomitant with retardation of its adjacent organs during development. This situation, together with the non-acropetal order among whorls of floral organs in Whytockia, is possibly related to a late expression and a remarkably different expression pattern of cycloidea-like genes as compared to Antirrhinum. Furthermore, the axile placentation in the bilocular ovary of Whytockia is formed by an involute closure of carpels rather than derived from a secondary fusion of two intrusive parietal placentae.

0037271630	Chromosomal localization of 5S and 18S-5.8S-25S ribosomal DNA sites in five Asian pines using fluorescence in situ hybridization	Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was employed on mitotic metaphase chromosome preparations of five Asian Pinus species: Pinus tabuliformis, Pinus yunnanensis, Pinus densata, Pinus massoniana and Pinus merkusii, using simultaneously DNA probes of the 18S rRNA gene and the 5S rRNA gene including the non-transcribed spacer sequences. The number and location of 18S rDNA sites varied markedly (5-10 pairs of strong signals) among the five pines. A maximum of 20 major 18S rDNA sites was observed in the diploid genome (2n = 24) of P. massoniana. The 5S rDNA FISH pattern was less variable, with one major site and one minor site commonly observed in each species. The differentiation of rDNA sites on chromosomes among the five pines correlates well with their phylogenic positions in Pinus as reconstructed from other molecular data. P. densata, a species of hybrid origin, resembles its parents (P. tabuliformis and P. yunnanensis), including some components characteristic of each parent in its pattern. However, the species is unique, showing new features resulting possibly from recombination and genome reorganization.

0036955563	A phylogeny of the rice tribe Oryzeae (Poaceae) based on matK sequence data	Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast gene mark for 26 species representing 11 genera of the tribe Oryzeae and three outgroup species. The sequenced fragments varied from 1522 base pairs (bp) to 1534 bp in length with 15.4% variable and 7.9% phylogenetically informative sites when the outgroups were excluded. The aligned sequences were analyzed by maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods. Analyses of the sequence data indicated that species of Oryzeae form a strongly supported monophyletic group, concordant with previous morphological and anatomical evidence. The tribe Oryzeae can be divided into two monophyletic lineages, corresponding to the traditionally recognized subtribes Oryzinae and Zizaniinae. The first subtribe consists of Oryza and Leersia, while the subtribe Zizaniinae includes the remaining genera. The mark sequence data did not support the close affinities of the monoecious genera in Oryzeae, implying the possibility of multiple origins of the floral structures in the tribe. It is noteworthy that Porteresia coarctata is closely related to Oryza species, suggesting that it should be treated as a member in the genus Oryza rather than a separate monotypic genus.

84878327972	Phylogenetic and biogeographic analyses of the Sino-Himalayan endemic genus Cyananthus (Campanulaceae) and implications for the evolution of its sexual system	Cyananthus (Campanulaceae) is a small genus consisting of ca. 20 species endemic to the Sino-Himalayan region. Based on phylogenetic analysis using nuclear ribosomal ITS and four plastid markers (matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and trnG-S), our results strongly support the monophyly of Cyananthus and its close relationship with the Codonopsis clade of the platycodonoids. Three major clades are supported, corresponding to the three sections of the genus, with sect. Cyananthus, which mainly occurs in the Himalayas, being a sister to the clade comprising the other two sections (sect. Stenolobi and sect. Annui) distributed primarily in the Hengduan Mountain region. We also observed that Cyananthus exhibits variation in its sexual system, possessing both hermaphroditic and gynodioecious species. Character evolution analyses using Mesquite suggest that gynodioecy evolved from hermaphroditism only once in sect. Stenolobi, but that there is a reversal in C. formosus. Molecular dating and biogeographic analysis with LAGRANGE support dispersal from the Himalayas to the Hengduan Mountains during the early evolution of Cyananthus. The extensive uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the Hengduan Mountains played an important role in the subsequent diversification of the genus. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that the platycodonoid group is a monophyletic group, and that four major clades can be recognized: (1) the Platycodon clade with colporate pollen, including Platycodon, Canarina, Cyclocodon, and Echinocodon; (2) the Cyananthus clade with colpate pollen and a superior ovary, including only Cyananthus; (3) the long-colpus clade with long-colpus pollen, an inferior ovary, and a disc or glands, including Codonopsis subg. Codonopsis, Campanumoea, and Leptocodon; and (4) the short-colpus clade with short-colpus pollen, an inferior ovary, and without a disc or glands, including Codonopsis subg. Pseudocodonopsis, subg. Obconicicapsula, and C. purpurea of Codonopsis subg. Codonopsis. These four major clades are strongly supported and well correlated with pollen type and morphology. The results support the separation of Cyclocodon from Codonopsis as a genus. The results also indicate that Campanumoea and Leptocodon should be merged with Codonopsis, whereas all taxa of the short-colpus clade should be separated from Codonopsis.

0040630440	Problems in the use of RAPD to the study of genetic diversity and systematics	Rapid, simple and highly sensitive are the great advantages of RAPD random amplified polymorphic DNA) method. However, its optimum condition of amplification varies greatly among different studies and, in turn, causes much debates in terms of its reproducibility and validation of its application to the study of systemetics. For this reason the authors tried to probe into some essential factors that might affect the result of RAPD assay. The results from the authors' genetic diversity research in Cathaya argyrophylla confirmed that (a) DNA templates, whether undergoing multiple steps of purification or not, showed the same RAPD profiles, hence, most of the steps would be unnecessary; (b) RNA, no matter deprived or not from the DNA templates, had no influence on amplification; (c) DNA templates with a wide range of concentration produced the same band patterns constantly; (d) DNA templates extracted from either fresh or dry leaves produced the same RAPD results. Therefore, it was concluded that RAPD exhibited very good reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors had also discussed some problems in product analysis and data analysis of RAPD. The use of RAPD method in taxonomic study was evaluated in the study on the relationships of congeneric species of Cimicifuga, Actaea asiatica and Aconitum sungpanense, and the applicability of RAPD to systematic studies of species and closely related genera, although with some limitations, was highly appreciated.

0041031593	Studies of morphological and allozyme variation of the endangered Adenophora lobophylla and its widespread congener A. potaninii	Genetic diversity in the endangered Adenophora lobophylla and its widespread congener, A. potaninii was investigated based on 12 morphological characters and 10 allozyme loci. We measured considerably high levels of genetic variability in both the endangered and the widespread species. The endangered A. lobophylla maintains comparable high level of genetic diversity to that of A. potaninii at the morphological characters surveyed. Similarly, the allozyme variation in A lobophylla(P=0.60, A1=1.87, H=0.180) is almost the same as that found in A. potaninii (P=0.60, A=1.82, H=0.193). The present study indicates clearly that the endangered A. lobophlylla is not genetically depauperate. Combined with other lines of evidence, we hypothesize that A. lobophylla has become endangered for ecological and stochastic reasons. Consequently, habitat protection is of particular importance for conserving this endangered species.

0042634319	A study on RAPD fingerprintings of wild mountain ginseng (Panax ginseng)	AIM: To analyse the genetic characteristics of wild ginseng. METHODS: The genetic diversity level of wild ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) was confirmed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Seven wild ginsengs, collected from different sites, with one garden ginseng were used in the study. RESULTS and CONCLUSION: From the fourteen 10-mer oligonucleotide primers 111 sites were detected, of which 76 (67.6%) were polymorghic. The level of genetic variation in wild ginseng was much higher than that in garden ginseng. Therefore, wild ginseng was a very precious material in breeding. According to the pairwise distances of all samples, one conclusion could be drawn that the evironment factor plays more important role than genetic factor in morphological change of wild ginseng which offers an evidence that even garden ginseng seed can develop to wild ginseng if it is planted in the mountains. Cluster analysis showed that the genetic variations among P. ginsengs were smaller than that between P. ginsengs and P. quinquefolius.

Two variable sites and three chlorotypes (TT, TC and GC) were detected on the rbcL gene of the three pines. P. densata harboured the three chlorotypes, two of which (TT, GC) were characteristic of the parental species, respectively. The third chlorotype (TC) was distributed extensively in seven of the 10 P. densata populations analysed, and might represent a mutation type or have been derived from an extinct parent. The distribution of chlorotypes, together with that of mitotypes, indicated that significant founder effect and backcross happened during the population establishment of the hybrid pine. P. tabuliformis and P. yunnanensis had acted as both mother and father donors, i.e. bi-directional gene flow existed between the two parental species in the past. Population differentiation of P. densata is high, as detected from the cytoplasmic genomes: G

0242659818	Unexpected high divergence in nrDNA ITS and extensive parallelism in floral morphology of Pedicularis (Orobanchaceae)	Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) were used in the phylogenetic reconstruction of Pedicularis, a genus with strong adaptive radiation. Forty-two species representing 12 greges of the genus were all, except P. resupinata, sampled from the Hengduan Mountain region, China. A high level of ITS sequence variation was found among the species distributed in such a small geographical area, which had been rarely reported in other groups. The great ITS divergence in Pedicularis could be explained by a relatively ancient origin and diversification of the genus followed by migration of different floristic components into the Hengduan Mountains, or accelerated rates of molecular evolution in parasitic lineages of Orobanchaceae. In the present ITS phylogeny, almost all the main clades are not consistent with the high hierarchical taxa within Pedicularis, which implies that significant parallel evolution occurred in floral morphology of the genus, and that undue attention has been paid to corolla characters in the intragenus classifications.

0242663617	Paeonia (Paeoniaceae) in the Caucasus	The taxonomy of the genus Paeonia in the Caucasus has been controversial, with recognized species varying in number from one to 13. The taxonomic history of Paeonia in this area is reviewed (including an analysis of the characters used by previous authors) based on extensive field observations, population sampling and critical examination of a large number of herbarium specimens. The results show that Paeonia may be divided into three groups. The P. intermedia group is known from only a single population. In the P. tenuifolia group, all the characters used for distinguishing the three previously recognized species were found to be polymorphic. In the P. daurica group, petal colour, shape and size of leaflets, and indumentum of leaflets and carpels were used to distinguish nine species, but these characters were found to be polymorphic or continuous in variation, and thus can only be used for infraspecific classification. Thus, three species are recognized: P. intermedia, P. tenuifolia and P. daurica. The last species is further divided into five subspecies: sspp. coriifolia, wittmanniana, mlokosewitschii, macrophylla and tomentosa stat. nov. © 2003 The Linnean Society of London.

0344017628	Observations on abnormal meiosis of pollen mother cells in Paeonia suffruticosa subsp. spontanea	Paeonia suffruticosa subsp. spontanea presents a variety of structural heterozygosity. Some abnormalities in meiosis of pollen mother cell (PMC) were observed in one variety of the natural population from Yongji County, Shanxi Province. Abnormalities observed are as follows: (1) Univalents. They were caused by failure in pairing, asynapsis and precocious cancellation of terminal chiasma. Oriented univalent pair was distributed at two poles normally in A I , while non-oriented univalent pair only at one pole. Another factor leading to univalents was that chromosomes were paired but without substantial exchange. The number and ratio of three kinds of chromosomes and their univalents were analysed and the result disagreed with that of Haga and Ogata. (2) Heteromorphic bivalents. A few cells were observed with unequal E bivalents. Segements of the short arm of one E chromosome might be deleted or else be involved in translocation. (3) Bivalent interlocking . A few cells were found with two or three bivalents interlocked, which might cause translocation. (4) A I and A II bridges. There were three kinds of bridges in A I and A II ; they were one single chromatid bridge, two single chromatid bridges and double bridge. The ratio of these three kinds of bridges was 11.8%, 1.5% and 0.19% respectively. Bridges at A II occurred as continuity of those of A I owing to simultaneous development of microspores. Some bridges without fragments are also discussed. (5) There were 1.69% A I cells with abnormal disjunction of bivalents, which were caused by nondisjunct bivalents pulled to one pole and non-oriented univalent pair moving to one pole. (6) A few cells were found with lagged univalents and micronucli at A I , A II and T II , some fragments could be observed at A I and M II . The relationship between abnormalities in meiosis of PMC and somatic karyotype and pollen sterility are discussed. It is concluded that aborted pollen grains and ovules , space limitation in carpellum and low germination rate of seeds in natural populations are the main causes leading to endangerous status of this species - P. suffruticosa subsp. spontanea, the heterozygosity degree of Sect. Mudan is lower than that of the other two sections.

The chromosome numbers of these taxa are 2n=10, 12, 14, 24, 28, and the basic chromosome numbers for the genus are x=5, 6, 7. All species except C. inflatus Hook. f. & Thoms. and C. microphyllus Edgew. were examined for the first time and a new ploidy level (tetraploidy) is reported in the genus. Chromosome measurement data were analyzed using cluster analysis. The relationships between three sections within Cyananthus and evolutionary trends within the genus are discussed in the light of karyological data. The cytological data suggest that Cyananthus is a relatively primitive genus in Campanulaceae and there is significant division within the genus, and polyploidization may have played an important role in the chromosome evolution and speciation of Cyananthus in the Himalayan-Hengduan Mountains. © 2014 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84908666005	Multiple species of wild tree peonies gave rise to the ‘king of flowers’, Paeonia suffruticosa andrews	The origin of cultivated tree peonies, known as the ‘king of flowers’ in China for more than 1000 years, has attracted considerable interest, but remained unsolved. Here, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of explicitly sampled traditional cultivars of tree peonies and all wild species from the shrubby section Moutan of the genus Paeonia based on sequences of 14 fast-evolved chloroplast regions and 25 presumably single-copy nuclear markers identified from RNA-seq data. The phylogeny of the wild species inferred from the nuclear markers was fully resolved and largely congruent with morphology and classification. The incongruence between the nuclear and chloroplast trees suggested that there had been gene flow between the wild species. The comparison of nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies including cultivars showed that the cultivated tree peonies originated from homoploid hybridization among five wild species. Since the origin, thousands of cultivated varieties have spread worldwide, whereas four parental species are currently endangered or on the verge of extinction. The documentation of extensive homoploid hybridization involved in tree peony domestication provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the origins of garden ornamentals and the way of preserving natural genetic resources through domestication.

84908897508	Evolution of the platycodonoid group with particular references to biogeography and character evolution	The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is an important center of origin and diversification for many northern temperate plants. The hypothesis "out-of-QTP" suggests that the majority of northern temperate plants have originated and dispersed from the QTP and adjacent regions. An interesting question is whether the biogeographic history of the platycodonoids (Campanulaceae), a group mainly distributed in the QTP and adjacent regions, coincides with the hypothesis "out-of-QTP"? Furthermore, how have the diagnostic characters of the platycodonoids evolved? In the present study, all 10 genera of the platycodonoids were sampled for molecular phylogeny and dating analyses, and ancestral states of distribution and characters were reconstructed. The results do not support the platycodonoids as an "out-of-QTP" group, but instead they might have descended from Tethyan ancestors. The dispersal and diversification of the platycodonoids in Asia might have been driven by the uplift of the QTP. The present study highlights the importance of the Tethyan Tertiary flora for the origin of the Sino-Himalayan flora and the influence of the uplift of QTP on diversification of northern temperate plants. In addition, character state reconstruction reveals that the inferior ovary, capsule, long-colpate pollen, and chromosome number 2n=14 are probably ancestral states.

Recent molecular and palynological analyses suggest that the latter two subgenera and Cod. purpurea Wall. are separated from rest Codonopsis. In the present study, extensive observations were carried out in wild populations and on more than 800 specimens of subg. Pseudocodonopsis, subg. Obconicicapsula, and Cod. purpurea. Their chromosome numbers were counted for the first time. Recent palynological and molecular data were also analyzed and reevaluated. Our integrated phylogenetic analyses revealed that the three groups are distinct from the rest of Codonopsis. Furthermore, they are also distinct from each other, and cannot be circumscribed in a single genus. Therefore, three new genera are here proposed based on molecular phylogenetics, palynology, cytology, and external morphology. New combinations are made in the present article.

0347996077	Marked Intragenomic Heterogeneity and Geographical Differentiation of nrDNA ITS in Larix potaninii (Pinaceae)	Nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) of gymnosperms, especially Pinaceae, is characterized by slow concerted evolution and exhibits substantial ITS-region length variation (975-3663 bp), in sharp contrast to the narrow range (565-700 bp) in angiosperms. Here we examined intra- and intergenomic heterogeneity of the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region in four varieties of Larix potaninii, a species from the mountainous areas of western China. Two clones with more than a 100-bp deletion in ITS1 were detected in L. potaninii var. chinensis and L. potaninii var. australis, respectively. The deletion resulted in the loss of most part, including the motif sequence, of subrepeat 1 (SR1). Sequence divergence and phylogenetic analyses showed that some clones would be pseudogenes given their low GC content, high substitution rates, unique positions in the phylogenetic trees, or significant length variation. These clones might represent orphons or paralogues at minor loci resulting from large-scale gene or chromosome reorganization. Some recombinants characterized by chimeric structure and discordant phylogenetic positions in partitioned sequence analyses indicate that unequal crossing-over plays an important role in the process of nrDNA concerted evolution. In addition, some varieties of L. potaninii might have experienced an nrDNA founder effect parallel to their geographical isolation.

0347352307	Origins of polyploids: An example from peonies (Paeonia) and a model for angiosperms	The majority of tetraploid peonies are allopolyploids derived from crosses between phylogenetically distinct diploid lineages. Tetraploid Paeonia obovata was previously considered to be an autopolyploid because it is morphologically indistinguishable from the diploid of the same species. The presence of the Adh2 gene in tetraploid P. obovata but the inability to amplify the Adh2 gene from Chinese diploids of P. obovata, however, suggests that the tetraploid was not an autotetraploid derivative of the geographically adjacent diploid populations in China. The Adh gene phylogenies rather suggest that the tetraploid originated from crosses between two geographical races of diploid P. obovata distributed in China and Japan. The intermediate status of tetraploid P. obovata between auto- and allopolyploidy highlights the need for population genetic analyses of polyploid origins along the continuous range of genomic divergence. Here we present a model that describes the probabilities of polyploid formation and establishment as a function of genomic divergence between diploid progenitors. The probability of polyploid formation (P
