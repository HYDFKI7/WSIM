2542458729	Thermobaric structure of a traverse across western Dabieshan: Implications for collision tectonics between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons	As the best preserved high- and ultrahigh-pressure (HP and UHP) metamorphic terrane in the Qinling-Dabieshan-Sulu orogen, western Dabieshan is divided into six lithotectonic units along a traverse across the orogen, i.e. from north to south, the Nanwan, Balifan, Huwan, Xinxian, Hong'an and Mulanshan units. In this terrane five eclogite-bearing zones (I-V) are developed. The garnet and clinopyroxene in eclogites from these zones exhibit chemical zoning, suggesting that the rims record general peak temperature and pressure. Thermobarometric study indicates that the peak P-T conditions of eclogite are 550-570°C and 21 kbar for Zone I, 470-500°C and 14 17 kbar for Zone II, 620-670°C and 26-29 kbar for Zone III, 530-560°C and 20-22 kbar for Zone IV, and 490-510°C and 19-20 kbar for Zone V. The symmetrical thermobaric pattern, in conjunction with structural and geochronological data, demonstrates that the Huwan and Hong'an units belong to the same HP slice overlying the UHP slice. This pattern, together with the Mulanshan LT/HP blueschist-greenschist belt in the south, roughly constitutes a 'normal' metamorphic zonation. However, clear metamorphic gaps occur between different slices. It is inferred that the LT/HP, HP and UHP slices were broken up from the downgoing slab during subduction and reached different depths along different geothermal gradients. The successive subduction of underlying slices leads to a nearly concomitant uplift of overlying slices, whereas exhumation of the deepest UHP slice was effected by underthrusting of the lower crust of the Yangtze craton. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

0033792958	Discovery of granulite in the Mianxian-Lueyang suture zone, Mianxian area and its tectonic significance	Mafic granulite lithoblocks, found at many localities near Xujiaping Village of Caimahe Town in Mianxian County, occur in Mian-Lue suture zone as a lithoblock. Its metamorphic mineral assemblage is Cpx+Gt+Pl(An30)+Qz+Rut. Temperature is between 657°C and 772°C calculated by thermometer of Ellis et al. Pressure ranges from 0.82 GPa to 1.17 GPa based on barometer by Newton et al.. Corrected values are respectively 0.97 GPa and 1.32 GPa. In thin-section, retrograde reaction in the mafic granulite is observed as Gt + Cpx = Hb + Pl. This reflects clockwise P-T-t path and metamorphic process with isothermal decompression, indicating collisional history along Mian-Lue suture zone of Qinling orogen.

0034915397	Constraints of geology and geochemistry on Paleoproterozoic pre-orogenic deep processes in Jiao-Liao Massif	Systematic analyses of geology and geochemistry revealed that the Paleoproterozoic pre-orogenic deep processes in the Jiao-Liao Massif might be mainly magma underplating, which was characterized with episodic activities, asymmetric patterns and southward tectonic migration. To be controlled by this deep process occurred the mafic magma emplacement yielding an age about 2.4 Ga, the bimodal volcanism of rift-type during 2.4 Ga to 1.9 Ga, and emplacement of the large monzogranitic magma during 2.2 Ga to 1.9 Ga. The emplacement of monzogranite triggered bedding-parallel sliding deformation of the sedimentary cover during 2.2 Ga to 1.9 Ga, which was accompanied with the pegmatitic veins of lit-par-lit injection, the lower-pressure and higher-temperature metamorphism, and the vertical bedding-parallel progressive metamorphism (a special metamorphic phenomenon related to extension).

84877781078	Characteristics and mechanism of submarine landslides in the Qiongdongnan basin, Northern South China Sea	Submarine landslides has been gradually attracted attentions because of exploration and exploitation of submarine gashydrate in the past decade. Submarine landslides in the Qiongdongnan basin, Northern South China Sea generally occur in continental slope where gashydrate usually accumulates. They play an important role to their development and exploration. We analyze the detailed geometric characteristics of submarine landslides in the Qiongdongnan basin based on the preexisting 2D seismic profiles to identify three major slide planes which are caused by three landslide events. Each landslide event can be divided into several secondary landslide stages. Typical landslide topography such as slide scarps, slide plane, slide terraces, slide valleys are widely developed in the study area. Based on preliminarily estimated, the Qiongdongnan submarine landslides cover an area of about 2500 km

84897902518	Mesozoic thrust and nappe structures in the Wulungu Depression of the Northeastern Junggar Basin	Located in the east edge of the Junggar Basin, the Wulungu Depression has developed many reverse faults since Mesozoic. Based on the structural interpretation of the typical two-dimensional seismic sections, combined with the forward modeling method of balanced cross-sections, the zonation, staging, propagation mode and dynamic processes of thrusting of the Wulungu Depression were investigated. The thrust and nappe structures of the Wulungu Depression, from north to south, are divided into the Hongyan Imbricated Thrust Belt in the root, the Suosuoquan Sag in the central part, the Kalasayi Fault in the front. The balanced and restored cross-sections show that Late Triassic to Cretaceous thrust system, which suffered from the S-N directed compression in the east edge of the Junggar Basin, has the characteristics of the imbricate basement-involved thrusting. The thrust system developed forward, propagating from the north to the south. That is to say, the fault activities in the north are relatively earlier than those in the south. According to stratum shrinkage rates at different stages, the evolution of thrust system can be divided into four stages, i.e. the Late Indosinian, the Early, Middle and Late Yanshanian. Fault analysis may suggest that the thrust system started in the Indosinian, the Early Yanshanian is the major active period when thrusting covered all over the study region, while the thrusting of the Middle Yanshanian is various, whereas the fault activity is weak in the Late Yanshanian. At the early Mesozoic, the thrust system in the Wulungu Depression underwent continuous compression from the southern Altaid Orogenic Belt. Later, it is still influenced by northward indentation from the northern Tianshan Orogenic Belt, which makes the Kalasayi Fault at the south of the Wulungu Depression to be a strike-slip fault, resulting from the extrusion-escape processes of adjustment among the micro-blocks within the Junggar Basin.

84897046988	Cenozoic tectonic jumping and implications for hydrocarbon accumulation in basins in the East Asia Continental Margin	Tectonic migration is a common geological process of basin formation and evolution. However, little is known about tectonic migration in the western Pacific margins. This paper focuses on the representative Cenozoic basins of East China and its surrounding seas in the western Pacific domain to discuss the phenomenon of tectonic jumping in Cenozoic basins, based on structural data from the Bohai Bay Basin, the South Yellow Sea Basin, the East China Sea Shelf Basin, and the South China Sea Continental Shelf Basin. The western Pacific active continental margin is the eastern margin of a global convergent system involving the Eurasian Plate, the Pacific Plate, and the Indian Plate. Under the combined effects of the India-Eurasia collision and retrogressive or roll-back subduction of the Pacific Plate, the western Pacific active continental margin had a wide basin-arc-trench system which migrated or 'jumped' eastward and further oceanward. This migration and jumping is characterized by progressive eastward younging of faulting, sedimentation, and subsidence within the basins. Owing to the tectonic migration, the geological conditions associated with hydrocarbon and gashydrate accumulation in the Cenozoic basins of East China and its adjacent seas also become progressively younger from west to east, showing eastward younging in the generation time of reservoirs, seals, traps, accumulations and preservation of hydrocarbon and gashydrate. Such a spatio-temporal distribution of Cenozoic hydrocarbon and gashydrate is significant for the oil, gas and gashydrate exploration in the East Asian Continental Margin. Finally, this study discusses the mechanism of Cenozoic intrabasinal and interbasinal tectonic migration in terms of interplate, intraplate and underplating processes. The migration or jumping regimes of three separate or interrelated events: (1) tectonism-magmatism, (2) basin formation, and (3) hydrocarbon-gashydrate accumulation are the combined effects of the Late Mesozoic extrusion tectonics, the Cenozoic NW-directed crustal extension, and the regional far-field eastward flow of the western asthenosphere due to the India-Eurasia plate collision, accompanied by eastward jumping and roll-back of subduction zones of the Pacific Plate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84907923443	Characteristics of hazardous geological factors on Shenhu continental slope in the northern South China Sea	Since Shenhu continental slope in the northern South China Sea is rich in oil and gas resources as well as natural gas hydrate, and its seabed stability is important for oil and gas exploitation and engineering projects. But special study on seabed stability here is far from being enough now. Based on interpretation of 2D seismic data, shallow profiles and multi-beam echo sounder data, this paper focuses on the whole geological environment of this area and identifies 20 different kinds of hazardous geological factors. According to the dynamic source, five hazard types are concluded as follows: tectonic stress-related, gravity-related, hydrodynamics-related, gas effusion-related and soil-related hazards. Each type includes multi-hazardous factors. According to the plan-view distribution of the hazardous geological factors, this area can be divided into the following six hazard regions: intensive areas of buried delta, submarine landslides, volcanism, weak layers, shallow fracture zone and shallow bedrock. Major hazardous factors and their seismic reflection characteristics are presented to provide scientific reference for development of future engineering projects in the study area.

54149113342	Spatial pattern of unconformities in depositional basin	After multidisciplinary analysis of the sectional and planimetric characteristic of the unconformities in the Tazhong uplift,as an example,the spatial patterns and distribution characteristic are elucidated and the structural evolution in the Palaeozoic is probed. In overlapped basins, which usually undergo multiple superposition of tectonic movements, many unconformity interfaces are developed. There are some rules in the distribution and spatial pattern of the unconformities, from the uplifted area to the sunken area, the high-angle and superimposed unconformities, low- angle truncated or onlayed triangle unconformities and parallel unconfornities or conformities develop respectively. The differences between the spatial patterns of the unconformities are important to control the oil-gas migration and accumulation. Considering the oil-gas geologic conditions in the Tazhong uplift, the onlap unconformities traps in the Devonian are expected.

71649101071	A comment on "Tectonic evolution of the Hengshan-Wutai-Fuping complexes and its implication for the Trans-North China Orogen"	In a recent issue of Precambrian Research (vol. 170, pp. 73-87), Wang (2009) published a paper entitled 'Tectonic evolution of the Hengshan-Wutai-Fuping complexes and its implication for the Trans-North China Orogen, in which he proposes that (1) the formation of arc-related igneous rocks in the Hengshan and Wutai Complexes formed by northwest-directed subduction, not by (south)east-directed subduction; and (2) the Wutai granitoids were the products of an intra-oceanic island arc, not formed in a continent-derived arc. However, we consider both the structural and geochemical approaches Wang (2009) adopted to determine the polarity of the subduction and the tectonic setting of the Wutai granitoids are inappropriate or invalid. Firstly, all his structural observations used to determine the polarity of subduction are restricted to the Zhujiafang and Longquanguan ductitle shear zones, both of which developed at the late stage. It is unreliable to use kinematic indicators from these later structures to infer the polarity of the pre-collisional subduction. Secondly, Wang (2009) assumed that the initial positive ε(Nd) values (+0.5 to +4.5) of the Wutai granitoids indicate their generation directly from a mantle source, forming in an intra-oceanic arc. Such an interpretation is incorrect because the positive ε(Nd) values of the Wutai granitoids merely indicate that the igneous protoliths of these granitoids originated from a depleted mantle source, not the Wutai granitoids themselves. As the products of the earliest arc magmatism in the Wutai arc, the Wutai granitoids could not be generated directly from a mantle source but must have been derived by partial melting of juvenile crust. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77649205271	A new type of reservoir of paleozoic buried hill in Zhuanghai Area: Discovery and characteristics of silicified rock	Based on the core description, microanalysis and processing of the logging data including AC, GR and DEN, a new type of silicalite reservoirs in Paleozoic buried hill in Zhuanghai area is found whose rock-electric properties are very different from those of protogenesis silicalites. Silicalite reservoirs are called silicified rock here and their characteristics are generalized. The structure of primary rock of silicified rock is clear and the idiomorphic degree of quartz crystal is high. Paragentic hydrothermal mineral assemblage of fluorite, barite, pyrite, ferrocalcite and quartz with secondary characteristic are common in silicified rock layer and the secondary corrosion of these paragentic hydrothermal minerals is significant. The pore of silicified layer is very developed including not only large solution cavities among breccias and secondary pores by dissolution of the Paragentic hydrothermal minerals, but also the micro-pores among the idiomorphic quartz crystal druse. The P-wave velocity and the density of silicified rock are much lower than that of the carbonate and the distribution of silicified rock in buried hill is featured with the "cross-layer" characteristic. By comparing with the characteristic of the protogenesis silicalite in Paleozoic buried hill, it is believed that the silicified rock is secondary genesis which resulted from deep buried modification. The secondary silicified rock is a new type of reservoir of Paleozoic buried hill in Zhuanghai area. The discovery of this new kind of reservoirs is not only of value to the high exploration basin, but also of scientific significance to the advance of silicate research.

77953972501	Structural characteristics and evolution in Guizhou Province, west of Xuefeng mountain	The main Mesozoic deformation in the Guizhou Province is Yanshanian three-stage folding, two-stage thrusting and three-stage strike slipping. Three-stage folds of different strikes are divided based on their newest-involved strata in these folds and their superposition relationship. The earliest is nearly EW-striking folds, and the second is NE-striking folds, followed by the N-S-striking folds. The folds formed between Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous. The thrust fault system consists of the top-to-northwest or top-to-west,NS-striking thrust faults coeval to the NS-striking folds. To the west of west margin of the Xuefeng basement,the thrust belt can be divided into three sections:the root zone,the middle zone and the frontal zone from the east to the west. It underwent two-stage thrusting in root zone. However, there is only one-stage thrusting in the other two zones. Three-stage, differently-oriented strike-slip faults extend spatially parallel to axes of three folds and temporally later than the equivalent folding, respectively. EW-striking strike-slip faults are dextral and transpressional. However,NE-striking strike-slip faults are almost sinistral and transextenional. According to their intersection and confinement among these faults, it is obvious that EW-striking strike-slip faults occurred at the earliest stage, followed by NS- and NE-striking ones in sequence. At last,a possible dynamic model about deformation in Guizhou is proposed.

77955013099	Not all folds and thrusts in the Yangtze foreland thrust belt are related to the Dabie Orogen: Insights from Mesozoic deformation south of the Yangtze River	The Yangtze foreland fold-and-thrust belt is located between the Mesozoic Dabie collisional orogen and the Mesozoic Jiangnan intraplate orogen in east-central China. Three regional deformation events are recognized in the Dabie Orogen north of the Yangtze River. The earliest regional deformation (D1) corresponded to a southeastward compression that occurred during the subduction of the South China Plate below the North China Plate. Top-to-the-southeast shearing coeval with Late Permian-Early Triassic blueschist facies metamorphism, was possibly associated with the development of regional gneissosity in the Dabie complexes and flat-ramp-style thrusts within the Neoproterozoic- Palaeozoic sedimentary cover, north of the Yangtze River. The main ductile deformation (D2) is also characterized by southeast-verging overturned and recumbent folds, coeval with the early stage of exhumation of the high-pressure rocks. A top-to-the-SW thrusting and WNW- striking open folds belong to a separate, later deformation phase, D3. Previous

77955013702	Two-stage Triassic exhumation of HP-UHP terranes in the western Dabie orogen of China: Constraints from structural geology	Abundant exposures of widely-distributed HP-UHP metamorphic rocks in the western part of the Dabie orogen enable us to study the tectonic evolution of HP-UHP terranes associated with the world's largest preserved continental subduction zone. Previous tectonic models for the Dabie orogen were based largely on metamorphic studies, most of them lacking significant structural constraints. We present a comprehensive structural analysis based on detailed structural geology. The results suggest that syn-UHP (D0 at 241-231. Ma) and syn-HP (D1 at 225-215. Ma) southeast-vergent thrusting formed a series of stacked structural slices. This was followed by southeast-vergent folding under amphibolite facies conditions (D2 at 215-205. Ma); then a third generation of flexural folding occurred at shallow levels (D3 at 200-184. Ma). This leads us to proposes a two-stage Triassic exhumation model in which initially rapid vertical extrusion (D0-D1) from UHP to HP conditions to lower crustal levels is followed by slow southeastward extrusion (D3) from lower crustal levels to the Earth's surface. The tectonic model combines the early southeastward vertical extrusion with the later southeastward lateral extrusion, revealing two different stages and thus different types of Triassic extrusion for the exhumation of HP-UHP rocks in the Dabie orogen. The first stage extrusion occurred in the Middle Triassic, whereas the second stage extrusion lasted from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic. These two extrusion episodes correlate with the two stages of Triassic exhumation of the Dabie HP-UHP rocks, respectively, during continental collision. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77956931014	Triassic retrograded eclogites and Cretaceous gneissic granites in the Tongbai Complex, central China: Implications for the architecture of the HP/UHP Tongbai-Dabie-Sulu collision zone	The Permo-Triassic Qinling-Tongbai-Dabie-Sulu collision zone between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons hosts a number of terranes; some of them carry evidence for ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphism. Discovery of retrograded high-pressure (HP) eclogites in the Tongbai Complex, in the middle of the orogen, brings fresh information to correlate segments of the orogen and understand dynamics of the orogeny. The 20 km wide Tongbai Complex is underlying two HP eclogite bearing lithotectonic units (the northern and southern eclogite zones) in the Tongbaishan area. It consists of gneissic granites and subordinate metamorphic enclaves. Among them, retrograded eclogites carry garnet with a compositional profile indicating a three-stage metamorphic evolution, from epidote-amphibolite, through eclogite, to amphibolite facies conditions. A thermobarometric study yields estimates of 660-700 °C and 8.0-10.3 kbar for the amphibolite facies stage. U-Pb geochronology and trace element characterization of zircon produced two important results. First, the dominant gneissic granites are Early Cretaceous (ca. 140. Ma) and not Neoproterozoic as formerly reported. Second, metaigneous enclaves, i.e. retrograded eclogites, garnet amphibolites, and dioritic-trondhjemitic gneisses, formed between 933 and 742. Ma and were metamorphosed at 232-220. Ma. Metasedimentary enclaves contain detrital zircons yielding two age populations of 2960 and 1966. Ma. Consequently, the tectonometamorphic evolution of the Tongbai Complex is quite similar to that of the Northern Dabie Complex, but the Tongbai Complex is likely to be positioned at a higher crustal level in the orogenic edifice. Furthermore, the lower metamorphic P- T conditions in Tongbaishan relative to the Dabie-Sulu region are hypothesized to have resulted from a shallower subduction. The younger metamorphic age (232-220. Ma) for the Tongbai Complex with respect to the overlying eclogite zones (metamorphism at ca. 255. Ma and cooling at ca. 238. Ma) reflects diachronous subduction and exhumation for these two HP slices. A similar process occurred in the Dabie and Sulu terranes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Xuefengshan intracontinental tectonic system is one important part of the Yangtze block. The distribution of the unconformities between Triassic and Jurassic in the Xuefengshan tectonic system reveals four kinds of contact interfaces, including high-angle unconformity, low-angle unconformity, disconformity and conformity and becoming younger and younger to the west. Then the characteristics of Indosinian folds are also subdivided into two directions of fold axial traces in the South China, i. e. northeast-and northwest-striking folds, which were superimposed by the N-S-trending thrusts. The authors proposed that the longitudinal arcuate and northeastward structures in the Xuefengshan intracontiental tectonic system result from a control of different block borders under the same stress field as the previous one. The first-generation NEE-striking folds are rotated from the earlier NNE-striking folds due to late block rotating. The second-generation NNE-striking folds superimpose the NEE-striking folds. The intracontinental shortening between the Yangtze and Cathaysian blocks was earlier than the collision of the South China block with the Qinling - Dabie micro-continent. The Yangtze block and the Qinling - Dabie micro-continent had rotated in Early Indosinian orogeny. these resulted in a difference between those earlier structural lines formed in Early Triassic, the perpendicular relation to these structural lines was at last remained although they underwent small rotation between the Yangtze and Cathaysian blocks.

79955472489	Thermochronological constraints on two-stage extrusion of HP/UHP terranes in the Dabie-Sulu orogen, east-central China	Along the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt in China crops out the world's largest terrane composed of ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic rocks. Differences in the timing and mechanisms of oceanic and continental subductions are assumed to be responsible for different ages of high-pressure (HP) and UHP slices in different parts of the belt. The western part of the Dabie orogen (western Dabie terrane) holds a key to understanding of the transition from oceanic to continental subduction. This paper reports geochronological results to test a two-stage tectonic model for the exhumation of HP/UHP rocks in western Dabie. This model involves two different stages and types of extrusion for exhumation of the HP/UHP rocks in east-central China. Mica Ar/Ar ages, ranging from 241 to 231. Ma, indicate a general middle Triassic cooling probably driven by early upward extrusion during the collision between the North and South China Blocks. Late Triassic-Early Jurassic cooling was associated with later eastward extrusion, ranging from 200 to 184. Ma. The second event is recorded also in mica in the region that was not affected by later deformation and magmatism. The lateral movement along lithosphere-scale faults resulted in the eastward extrusion of the HP-UHP metamorphic terrane, which was followed, in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic time, by a major compressive event. These two extrusion events are correlative with the two stages of Triassic exhumation of the western Dabie HP-UHP rocks, respectively. Wintin the framework of the Qinling-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt, it is suggested for western Dabie that the subduction/exhumation of blueschist-facies unit is related to the Mianlue suture, whereas the subduction/exhumation of HP/UHP eclogite-facies units is related to the Shangdan suture. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79957815700	3D numerical modeling of strain field in Sumatra area influenced by the coupling effect of subduction zone	The effect of subduction coupling zone on the Sunda fore-arc and its surrounding area is modeled using finite element analysis. Based on the simulation results, which are compared with GPS survey, seismological data and geological analysis, we quantitatively analyze the distribution of strain intensity and direction of principal strain of the Sumatra and its surrounding area. Then, the relationship between the area of subduction coupling zone and tectonic evolution is discussed accordingly. The model consists of lithosphere and upper mantle of athenosphere with viscoplasticity properties. The lithosphere includes the continental lithospheric, the oceanic lithospheric and subducted slabs. The results are as follows; (1) by adjusting the area of subduction coupling zone, we find out that with coupling area increasing, the value of strain intensity tends to increase. Meanwhile, the distribution of strain field in the other areas can be affected by increase of strain intensity. Therefore, the Sumatra fore-arc shows an obvious segmentation of strain intensity, which corresponds to the rupture pattern of the Sumatra earthquake belt. (2) There is a difference in principal direction of strain between the north and the south of Sumatra, which results from the integrated effects of various subduction velocity, direction, configuration and coupling area in different regions along the subduction zone. (3) Although the northern Sumatra is in a weak coupling condition based on our simulation results, there still exists a vertical negative displacement influenced by the subduction. This result shows that this area is a tectonic environment of the development of tsunami after earthquake.

79960492181	Assembly, accretion, and break-up of the Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic Columbia supercontinent: Record in the North China Craton revisited	Columbia is a Palaeo-Mesoproterozoic supercontinent that was assembled during global 2.0-1.8Ga collisional events, underwent long-lived, subduction-related accretion at key continental margins in the period 1.8-1.3Ga, commenced to fragment ∼1.6Ga ago, and finally broke up at ∼1.3Ga. Similar to most other cratonic blocks (Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia, Amazonia, West African, South Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica), the North China Craton records the history of assembly, accretion, and break-up of the Columbia supercontinent. New data indicate that the Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic basement of the North China Craton was assembled by microcontinental blocks along three Palaeoproterozoic collisional belts: the Khondalite Belt, the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, and the Trans-North China Orogen. The Khondalite Belt was formed by collision between the Yinshan and Ordos blocks and was amalgamated to form the Western Block at ∼1.95Ga. The Eastern Block underwent Palaeoproterozoic rifting at 2.2-1.9Ga to break-up into the Longgang and Nangrim blocks; then the rift basin/incipient ocean closed attending subduction and collision to form the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt at ∼1.9Ga. Finally, the Western and Eastern blocks collided along the Trans-North China Orogen to form the coherent basement of the North China Craton at ∼1.85Ga. Following this final assembly, the North China Craton underwent subduction-related accretion at its southern margin during the period 1.78-1.45Ga, forming the Xiong'er volcanic belt. At 1.6-1.2Ga, the northern margin of the North China Craton underwent a rifting event that led to separation of the craton from other cratonic blocks of the supercontinent Columbia, forming the 1.6-1.2Ga Zhaertai-Bayan Obo rift zone and associated 1.35Ga mafic sills along the northern margin of the craton. These data indicate that in any configuration of Columbia, the southern margin of the North China Craton must have faced an open ocean, whereas its northern margin was connected to another continental block. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

80051608662	The tongbai HP metamorphic terrane: Constraints on the architecture and subduction/exhumation of the Tongbai-Dabie-Sulu HP/UHP metamorphic belt	The Tongbai orogen is situated at the junction between the Qinling and Dabie-Sulu orogenes: hence it may hold a key to understanding the geological relationships and tectonic evolution of different terranes in the Qinling-Tongbai-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt. The Tongbai high-pressure (HP) metamorphic terrane comprises two HP slices (I and II) and a tectonic mélange zone in the north and a blueschist-greenschist zone in the south. The HP slice I is represented by the northern and southern eclogite zones occurring on the two sides of the Tongbaishan antiform. The peak metamorphic conditions are estimated to be 530-610°C and 1. 7 ∼ 2. OGPa for the northern zone and 460 ∼ 560°C and 1.3-1. 9GPa for the southern zone. The HP slice II is represented by the metamorphic enclaves in gneissic granites in the Tongbai complex. Their peak metamorphic conditions are inferred to be within the eclogites facies field of <700°C and > 1.2GPa, and retrograde P-T conditions at 660 ∼ 700°C and 0.80 ∼ 1.03GPa. U-Pb, Lu-Hf, Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar multichronometric data indicate the peak metamorphism of the HP slice I taking place at 255Ma, whereas cooling to the closure temperature of muscovite at 238Ma. By contrast, the metamorphic ages of the HP slice II are as young as 232 ∼220Ma, whereas gneissic granites dominating the Tongbai complex were emplaced at 140Ma. This suggests that, when the HP slice II was subducted to deep levels and underwent HP metamorphism, the HP slice II overlain it might have been exhumed to mid-to upper-crustal levels. This testifies a diachronous (differential) subduction/exhumation model of different HP and ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) slices proposed for the western Dabie, eastern Dabie and Sulu regions. Furthermore, the above data demonstrate the commencement of subduction of the South China continental crust at the Late Permian, which also represents the transitional time of oceanic to continental subduction between the North and South China blocks. Based on the similarity between the Tongbai and North Dabie complexes, we consider that a lower P-T environment and the absence of UHP rocks in the Tongbai HP metamorphic terrane might be resulted from the shallower subduction of the South China block towards the west. The final west-narrowing architecture of the Tongbai-Dabie HP/UHP metamorphic belt is related to the Early Cretaceous extrusion towards the east.

80054953382	Palaeoproterozoic tectonothermal evolution and deep crustal processes in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton: A review	The Palaeoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt is located in the eastern margin of the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. In this paper, we synthesize the tectonothermal evolution and deep crustal processes in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt based on recent information. A mantle plume-related underplating from 2.53 to 2.36Ga is envisaged which led to the emplacement of the 2.47-2.33Ga alkali granite plutons and mafic dyke swarms, followed by the development of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Rift and bi-modal volcanism. The underplating resulted not only in different sedimentary environments in the upper crust, but also in a differentiation of the initial thermal structure in the rift. This controlled the metamorphism and style of P-T-t paths in the different parts of the rift. Subsequent underplating resulted in the emplacement of the A-type Liaoji granites of ca. 2.17Ga in the lower crust, and the formation of associated pegmatites of 2.2 and 2.0Ga, together with the development of a bedding-parallel extension. However, the main orogeny occurred between 1.93 and 1.88Ga with closing of the rift, compressional deformation and high-pressure granulite metamorphism in the southern part of the orogen. Subsequently, lithospheric blocks were possibly delaminated at ~1.85Ga; anorogenic magmatic rocks such as rapakivi granite, alkaline granites and syenite were intruded, and pegmatite veins and mafic dyke swarms were emplaced cross-cutting all the earlier structural traces. We identify that the underplating styles, collision processes and delamination types in the deep lithosphere controlled the tectonothermal evolution of the crust in the Jiao-Liao-Ji region. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The existence of the abundant Kwangsian gneissoid granites, which have incorrectly been assigned to the Precambrian basement, indicates that the "so-called" Precambrian stratigraphic sequence of the Cathaysia Block should be termed "Complex" rather than "Group".

80054004528	Pull-apart basins within the North China craton: Structural pattern and evolution of Huanghua depression in Bohai Bay basin	There are many pull apart basins such as Shanxi graben, Jiao-Lai basin and some sags in the Bohai Bay basin within the North China craton. The Huanghua depression is such a pull apart basin located at the center of the Bohai Bay basin. It is NNE-trending depression separating the NNE-trending Jizhong depression from the NWW-trending Jiyang depression. It developed as a pull apart basin in a large-scale strike-slipping fault system. The western margin of the depression is the Cangdong fault system, which is the Lan-Liao-Yanshan-Yangerzhuang fault system. The "Great Qikou sag" is the biggest sag with sedimentary thickness of more than 11 km and under intensive extensional region of the Bohai Bay basin area. The Huanghua depression has sharp western and eastern boundary faults controlling pull apart basin. The "Great Qikou sag" is the major component of the Huanghua depression, its inner structural pattern is controlled by E-W trending structures rather than the previously known Cangdong fault. The single sag in the Huanghua depression is characterized by graben in the lower part and the half graben in the upper part. The heaves in the Huanghua depression developed in the Shayi sedimentary stage, separating "the Great Qikou sag" into several sub-sags such as the present-day Qikou sag, Banqiao sag, Qibei sag and Qinan sag. The Huanghua depression has four major faults including NNE-trending strike-slipping boundary faults, NEE-trending regional extensional faults, E-W trending secondary extensional faults and N-S trending transfer zones such as the coastal transfer zone and the Kongdian heave. The different extensional domains are controlled by the single detachment fault system in the basement. The architecture of the "Great Qikou sag" is a result of the late destruction of the North China craton under regional NNW-oriented extension. The basin underwent four stages of evolutions including Eocene propagating rifting called Kongdian event, Early Oligocene pull-apart graben called Jiyang event, Late Oligocene half-graben called Dongying event and Miocence-Pleistocene thermal depression under dish-like bukling.

80054027340	Metamorphic patterns and SHRIMP zircon ages of medium-to-high grade rocks from the Tongbai orogen, central China: Implications for multiple accretion/collision processes prior to terminal continental collision	The Qinling-Tongbai-Dabie-Sulu orogenic belt comprises a Palaeozoic accretion-dominated system in the north and a Mesozoic collision-dominated system in the south. A combined petrological and geochronological study of the medium-to-high grade metamorphic rocks from the diverse Palaeozoic tectonic units in the Tongbai orogen was undertaken to help elucidate the origins of Triassic ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism and collision dynamics between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons. Peak metamorphic conditions are 570-610°C and 9.3-11.2kbar for the lower unit of the Kuanping Group, 630-650°C and 6.6-8.9kbar for the upper unit of the Kuanping Group, 550-600°C and 6.3-7.7kbar for the Erlangping Group, 770-830°C and 6.9-8.5kbar for the Qinling Group and 660-720°C and 9.1-11.5kbar for the Guishan complex. Reaction textures and garnet compositions indicate clockwise P-T paths for the amphibolite facies rocks of the Kuanping Group and Guishan complex, and an anticlockwise P-T path for the granulite facies rocks of the Qinling Group. Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe U-Pb zircon dating on metamorphic rocks and deformed granite/pegmatites revealed two major Palaeozoic tectonometamorphic events. (i) During the Silurian-Devonian (c. 440-400Ma), the Qinling continental arc and Erlangping intra-oceanic arc collided with the Sino-Korean craton. The emplacement of the Huanggang diorite complex resulted in an inverted thermal gradient in the underlying Kuanping Group and subsequent thermal relaxation during the exhumation. Meanwhile, the oceanic subduction beneath the Qinling continental arc produced magmatic underplating and intrusion, leading to granulite facies metamorphism followed by a near-isobaric cooling path. (ii) During the Carboniferous (c. 340-310Ma), the northward subduction of the Palaeo-Tethyan ocean generated a medium P/T Guishan complex in the hangingwall and a high P/T Xiongdian eclogite belt in the footwall. The Guishan complex and Xiongdian eclogite belt are therefore considered to be paired metamorphic belts. Subsequent separation of the paired belts is inferred to be related to the juxtaposition of the Carboniferous eclogites with the Triassic HP metamorphic complex during continental subduction and exhumation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

82555180530	Tectonic features of the Fanjing Mount and Sangzhi Area on the west of Xuefeng uplift	Our study area from the Fanjing Mountain to the Sangzhi County is a part of the propagation tectonic zone of the Xuefengshan Precambrian basement. Expounding the deformation in the area facilitates not only the understanding of the deformation in and around the Xuefengshan, but also the exploration in the marine strata in the southern China. Complex history of deformation in the area can be divided into two-stage Indosinian deformation and two-stage Yanshanian deformation. Two-stage Indosinian deformation is of NEE-EW-and NE-striking folding or faulting. Two-stage Yanshanian deformation is of NE-and NNE-NS-striking faulting or folding. Based on the structural analysis and the tectonic setting, this paper suggests that Indosinian deformation mechanism is mainly related to closing of Tethys Ocean and scissor-style collision of South China to North China plates; however, Yanshanian deformation mechanism is mainly related to northwestward subduction of Izanaqi plate and Kula-Pacific plate.

In the study area, there are intensive neotectonic movement. The main manifestations of the neotectonics include vertical movement, fracture activity and magma activity. The research indicate that the sedimentation centers shift from west to east since Miocene. NE-NNE-striking fault and EW-striking fault are the main active faults. The activity of these faults are gradually later from west to east. The magma activity are frequent and can be divided into three phases in the neotectonic period. They are mainly distribute along active faults. From west to east, the magma activity phases are gradually later. The intrusion gradually weaken and eruption gradually strengthen.

84857532515	Mesozoic basins in eastern China and their bearing on the deconstruction of the North China Craton	Mesozoic basins occur widely in the Eastern Block and the neighboring area of the North China Craton, including the Bohai Bay, the Jiaolai, the Hefei and the North Yellow Sea in the north, and the Jianghan and the Subei-South Yellow Sea basins to the south. Their spatial-temporal framework is the consequence of the Indosinian and Yanshanian tectonic regimes in eastern China and record the events related to Mesozoic deconstruction of the North China Craton. Our results demonstrate that the Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the eastern North China Craton was related to both sub-crustal delamination and intra-crustal extrusion or escape tectonics. Thus, we propose that the mechanism of uplift of the Yanshanian North China Plateau and related lithosphere thinning in the eastern North China Craton were related to sub-crustal delamination at depth. However, the different distribution patterns of the basins on both sides of the Tan-Lu Fault System as well as the co-existence of both compressional and extensional basins in the Mesozoic indicate that these were controlled by escape tectonics in different tectonic parts of the crust. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we investigate the geochemical and isotopic signature of basalts from the Guangxi and Guizhou regions in the eastern margin of the Emeishan LIP and report the occurrence of high Ti/Y basalts in Guangxi. The zircons separated from Guangxi basalts yield a U-Pb concordia age of 257Ma, which is consistent with the age of the plume-related eruption of the Emeishan LIP.

84857561407	Structural anatomy and dynamics of evolution of the Qikou Sag, Bohai Bay Basin: Implications for the destruction of North China craton	The Qikou Sag is a complex Cenozoic faulted basin at the center of the Bohai Bay Basin. The Paleogene sediments in the basin show a maximum thickness of 11,000. m in Paleogene representing intense crustal extension. The sag has a typical dish-like structure in the upper part, with the central domain represented by a deep half graben, and surrounded by different types of gentle slopes and sub-sags linked with the basin-margin uplifts. The inner structure of the sag is jointly controlled by the basin-margin extensional faults, intrabasinal extensional tectonics and transfer tectonics. The sag is divided into four different extensional tectonic domains by the basement fault along the coastline, the Haihe-Xingang Fault and the Qidong Fault. These sub-sags are in turn controlled by different detachment systems. The listric Cangdong and Hangu faults mark the major boundary faults controlling the extensional structure of the basin.The structure and tectonics of the Qikou Sag provide a direct record of the late stages of rifting and destruction of the North China Craton. The Mesozoic basement structures of the sag determine the tectonic styles in different sub-sags. The complete inversion of the structures in Mesozoic profoundly influenced the development and evolution of the basin during Paleogene. We identify three main stages in the tectonic evolution of the Qikou: the Oligocene faulting stage, the Miocene-Pliocene thermal subsidence stage and the Pleistocene-Quaternary depression stage. In the Oligocene, fault activities and the basin architecture were mainly controlled by the listric boundary fault system of the basin and the secondary fault system in the hanging wall under the detachment and extension in the upper crust. Since Miocene, the boundary fault of the basin underwent weak extension. The upwelling of the upper mantle and the formation of corresponding shallow depressions contributed to the evolution and tectonic architecture of the Qikou Sag. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857600133	Cenozoic faulting of the Bohai Bay Basin and its bearing on the destruction of the eastern North China Craton	The Cenozoic Bohai Bay Basin is located at the center of the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. The structural architecture of this basin provides important clues on the deep-seated lithosphere thinning of the North China Craton. The Cenozoic regional stress field is characterized by NW-oriented extension. However, the various Cenozoic structural patterns of normal faulting and related transverse folding in the Bohai Bay Basin are controlled not only by Cenozoic stress field, but also by strain field and Mesozoic basement fault assemblages in this area. Regionally, the Cenozoic tectonic features and the dynamic evolution of the eastern North China Craton are dominated by two lithosphere-penetrating fault systems including the sinistral Tan-Lu Fault System and the dextral Lan-Liao Fault System. To the west of the Lan-Liao Fault System, Cenozoic extensional tectonics includes NNE-trending listric normal faults that controlled half grabens. However, between these two fault systems are WNW-trending half grabens which show basement-involved faulting in the north and overlapping relations between sedimentary cover and basement in the south. To the east of the Tan-Lu fault, the North Yellow Sea Basin is a WNW-trending fault depression with faulting in the south and overlapping relations in the north. These structural features are inherited from the Mesozoic tectonic framework of this area, whose tectonic characteristics were completely controlled by two opposite strike-slipping faults, the trans-extensional or oblique rifting in the Paleogene, followed by extensional faulting and subsequent subsidence. Furthermore, the culmination of the decratonization of the North China Craton was also related to an eastward jump of Cenozoic subduction of the Pacific Plate and the far-field effect of eastward extrusion of Cenozoic subduction of the Indian Plate, and was not essentially restricted to the early Mesozoic processes. Therefore, the Cenozoic, especially ∼25. Ma marks the time of cessation of the processes that led to lithosphere thinning and destruction of the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857627684	Petrology and P-T path of the yishui mafic granulites: Implications for tectonothermal evolution of the western shandong complex in the eastern block of the North China craton	Mafic granulites from the Yishui Group of the Western Shandong Complex in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton occur as enclaves or boudins within Late Archean TTG gneisses, and are composed mainly of garnet, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, plagioclase, hornblende, and minor quartz, ilmenite, and magnetite. Petrographic examination has revealed three distinct metamorphic mineral assemblages: the pre-peak prograde assemblage (M1) of hornblende+plagioclase+quartz+ilmenite+magnetite occurring as inclusions within garnet and pyroxene grains, peak assemblage (M2) of orthopyroxene+clinopyroxene+plagioclase+garnet+hornblende+quartz+ilmenite+magnetite, and post-peak assemblage (M3) represented by garnet+quartz and garnet+ilmenite/magnetite symplectites. Pseudosection modeling using THERMOCALC in the NCFMASHTO model system for a representative sample constrains the P-T conditions of M1, M2 and M3 stages at 660-730°C/<6.6kbar, 800-820°C/8.0-8.5kbar and 686-710°C/7.6-8.6kbar, respectively. The results of petrology and quantitative P-T pseudosection modeling define an anticlockwise P-T path involving near-isobaric cooling following the peak medium-pressure granulite-facies metamorphism, suggesting that the metamorphism of the Yishui Group was most likely related to the intrusion and underplating of mantle-derived magmas. Although the underplating of voluminous mantle-derived magmas leading to granulite-facies metamorphism with an anticlockwise P-T path involving isobaric cooling may occur in continental magmatic arc regions, above hot spots driven by mantle plumes, or in continental rift environments, a mantle plume model is favored because this model can reasonably interpret many other geological features of Late Archean basement rocks from the Western Shandong Complex in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton as well as their anticlockwise P-T paths involving isobaric cooling. The relatively cooler mantle-plume head heated the crust initially, causing amphibolite-facies metamorphism (M1). Subsequently, the relatively hotter mantle-plume tail heated the crust, causing granulite-facies metamorphism (M2). Finally, a near-isobaric cooling process (M3) occurred when the mantle plume ceased to heat the crust. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84857634740	Metamorphic P-T path and implications of high-pressure pelitic granulites from the Jiaobei massif in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton	High-pressure pelitic granulites have recently been found from the Jiaobei massif in the southern segment of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB), which separates the Eastern Block of the North China Craton into the Longgang and Langrim Blocks. Petrological evidence from these high-pressure pelitic granulites indicates three distinct metamorphic stages (M1-M3). The pre-peak (M1) stage is represented by a mineral assemblage of garnet (core). +. inclusion-type minerals within the garnet (biotite. +. kyanite. +. muscovite. +. plagioclase. +. quartz. +. ilmenite). The peak (M2) stage is marked by a mineral assemblage of garnet (mantle). +. K-feldspar. +. kyanite. +. plagioclase. +. biotite. +. rutile. +. ilmenite. +. quartz. The post-peak (M3) stage is featured by a mineral assemblage of garnet (rim). +. sillimanite. +. plagioclase. +. biotite. +. ilmenite. +. quartz. Using the THERMOCALAC technique, the NCKFMASHTO system has been applied to construct pseudosections for a representative high-pressure pelitic granulite sample. P-T conditions for the M1, M2 and M3 stages are constrained at 9.3-10.7. kbar/645-670. °C, 14.8-16.2. kbar/860-890. °C, and 6.3-8.5. kbar/710-740. °C, respectively. The mineral assemblages and P-T conditions of the high-pressure pelitic granulites define a clockwise P-T path involving decompression and cooling following the peak high-pressure granulite facies metamorphism. This suggests that the high-pressure pelitic granulites experienced the initial crustal thickening (M1 and M2), followed by exhumation and cooling (M3), which implies that the southern segment of the JLJB must have been involved in subduction- or collision-related tectonic processes. Therefore, the JLJB may represent another Paleoproterozoic collisional belt along which the Longgang and Langrim Blocks amalgamated to form the Eastern Block. © 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.

84859049622	Intracontinental deformation in a frontier of super-convergence: A perspective on the tectonic milieu of the South China Block	Since Mesozoic, the South China region has been located at the center of a triangular area surrounded by westward subduction of the Pacific plate, northward subduction of the India Plate beneath the Eurasia Plate, and collision of the North and South China blocks along the Central China Orogen. This region thus marks the frontier of a super-convergent regime. Within the super-convergence domain, the compressional structures in the center of the South China Block are mainly characterized by shortening, thrusting and decollement. The block underwent inhomogeneous rejuvenation of the pre-existing crust and lithospheric structures through reactivation of late-stage activities. The surface deformation of the Xuefeng Intracontinental Tectonic System within the South China Block is possibly derived from intraplate tectonics. Particularly, the distinct magmatism between the west and east limbs of the Xuefeng Precambrian Uplift is a possible response of the rheological structure of the lithosphere. The deep structures as revealed from tomographic studies show marked difference of lithosphere architecture between the eastern and western sub-blocks of the South China Block. These data illustrate the long-term mosaic of multi-block convergence which led to present-day inhomogeneity in the continental lithosphere in South China. A comparison of the intensive contraction of the South China Block with the distinct features of rifting of the North China Block, brings out the contrasting structural and tectonic signatures developed in the same frontier of one of the largest super-convergent systems on the globe during the Mesozoic to Cenozoic. © 2011.

84859060905	Geometry and timing of Mesozoic deformation in the western part of the Xuefeng Tectonic Belt, South China: Implications for intra-continental deformation	The Xuefeng Tectonic Belt is an important intraplate structural system in the South China Block. Its west margin is up to 1300. km away the present-day continental margin, and the Mesozoic structural trends in this belt are perpendicular to and have no correlation with the Triassic Qinling-Dabie Orogenic Belt. This belt provides important clues for understanding the mechanism of intraplate deformation and the tectonic history of South China. We identified two generations of folding with different strike directions in the Xuefeng Tectonic Belt based on the youngest folding-involved strata and their overprinting relationship. The early one is NE-striking, overprinted by the N-S-striking folds both during Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous. Thrust faults in the Xuefeng Tectonic Belt mainly show top-to-west thrust movement, which is approximately coeval with the N-S-striking folding. The thrust fault system can be divided into three zones: the root zone with steep thrusts, the middle zone characterized by imbricate thrusts, and the frontal zone with a few shallow thrusts. In addition, two generations of strike-slip faults with different structural trends have been identified: E-W-striking strike-slip faults showing dextral transpression, and NE-striking strike-slip faults with sinistral offset and controlling the upper Cretaceous basins. According to regional geological relationship and structural overprinting, we interpret that the E-W trending strike-slip faults formed in the first stage, whereas the NE-striking strike-slip faults formed later during an E-W-oriented compressional event. Therefore, the principal stress direction varies from NW-SE to E-W. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This research reveals that the "foreland" is in fact one fold-thrust fold belt related to the evolution of the Jiuling Basement Uplift Zone in the Central of the Yangtze Block. Combined with magnetotelluric sounding data, wide-angle reflection, seismic refraction, P-wave tomography, seismic reflection imaging of the MOHO surface, it reveals that the crustal architecture has difference between the upper and the lower crusts, like fish-bone shape based on rock properties, velocity, MOHO offset and deformation. It is deduced that the south-directed thrusting in the deep of the north Yangtze Block is closely related to the exhumation of the HP-UHP rocks of the Dabie Orogen based on surface geology and the mentioned-above architecture. However, the shallow structures are opposite thrust style composed of the north-directed thrusts of the north Yangtze Block and the south-directed thrusts of the Dabie Orogen. At last, the tectonic evolution and setting and deformation regimes are discussed and analyzed in this paper.

84863391831	Application of stratum structure extrapolation method in the multi-stage denudation thickness estimation of the Paleozoic in Tazhong Uplift	Denudation estimation is an important and fundamental work in the research of basins. However, the common methods for estimating the denudation thickness have some limitation: they are generally used only for estimating the total denudation thickness of some interface or the denudation thickness causing by single-stage structural activity. But the stratum structure extrapolation method can be used for estimating the denudation thickness causing by multi-stage structural activities. The comprehensive study of some seismic sections shows that there are 3 main denudation interfaces in Tazhong Uplift. The denudation distribution characteristics of these interfaces on profile and on the plane indicate that the structural evolution controls the denudation distribution in Tazhong Uplift. Moreover, the differences between the denudations of different stages can reflect the palaeogeomorphological characteristics and structural evolutionary processes of the stages.

This paper selects 17 balanced cross-sections from principal Sags in the East China Sea shelf basin. The amount of extensional and compressive ratios from principal sags in Cenozoic have been obtained by means of the technique of balanced cross-sections. Extensional and compressive ratios analyzing showed that the tectonic evolution jumped from west to east in the East China Sea shelf basin. The center of rifting expansion was in the western zone from Late Cretaceous to Late Paleocene, which jumped to eastern zone in the Eocene and to the Okinawa trough basin in the Pliocene. The north of the western zone reversed in the middle and Late Paleocene, and Xihu sag of eastern zone reversed in Miocene. The difference of the east depression belt and the west depression belt in structural evolution proved that the East China Sea shelf basin is east and west sub-zone. The difference of Changjiang depression in the north of the west depression belt and Diaobei depression in the south in structural evolution and the difference of Xihu sag in the north of the east depression belt and Taibei depression in the south in structural evolution proved that the East China Sea shelf basin is north and south sub-zone.

84865662908	Metamorphic P-T path and tectonic implications of medium-pressure pelitic granulites from the Jiaobei massif in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton	Both medium- and high-pressure pelitic granulites were found in the Jiaobei massif in the southern segment of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, which is a Paleoproterozoic tectonic belt in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. Studies on mineral assemblages and metamorphic reaction textures reveal that the medium-pressure pelitic granulites from the Jiaobei massif underwent four metamorphic stages: (1) the prograde stage (M1) represented by mineral inclusions within the core of garnet grains; (2) the peak stage (M2) indicated by the formation of sillimanite. +. K-feldspar and the growth of inclusion-free garnet mantle, (3) the decompression stage (M3) characterized by the cordierite. +. sillimanite symplectite, and (4) the decompression-cooling stage (M4) forming cordierite coronas. An integrated study of mineral reaction textures, mineral chemistry and pseudosection modelling in the NCFKMASHTO system with the THERMOCALC technique constrains the P-. T conditions of 9.4-10. kbar and 870-900. °C for the M2 stage, 6.3-6.6. kbar and 840-900. °C for the M3 stage, and 4-5.2. kbar and 815-830. °C for the M4 stage. The P-. T conditions of the early prograde (M1) assemblage cannot be estimated due to reworking at later metamorphic stages (M2-M4). The mineral assemblages of the M2-M4 stages and their P-. T conditions define a clockwise P-. T path involving isothermal decompression (ITD) and subsequent decompression-cooling for the medium-pressure pelitic granulites, which are consistent with a continent-continent collision environment. This suggests that the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt was not formed simply by the closure of a Paleoproterozoic rift basin as conventionally considered, but the tectonic evolution of its southern segment must have been involved in subduction and/or continent-continent collisional processes. Based on this study and previous data, we propose that the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt represented a Paleoproterozoic rifting- and collision-belt along which the Langgang and Langrim Blocks amalgamated to form the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84869099822	Joint inversion of gravity, magnetic and seismic data of the South Yellow Sea Basin	The south Yellow Sea Basin, based on the pre-Nanhua metamorphic basement of the Lower Yangtze Platform, is a polycycle basin with a sandwich-type construction. The geologic evolution of the basin can be divided into three stages: the Nanhua-early and middle Triassic marine basin stage, the late Cretaceous-Paleogene graben fault basin stage and the Neogene-Quaternary depression basin stage. Gravity and magnetic anomalies restrained by seismic data are inverted by 2.5D gravity-magnetic-seismic inversion from newly acquired seismic, gravity, and magnetic data. The inversion results indicate that the joint inversion method is helpful to research the contact relation between the basin and mountains, and to identify fault distribution, deep targets and favorable structural traps in future oil and gas exploration.

84869883186	Petrology and metamorphic P-T path of high-pressure mafic granulites from the Jiaobei massif in the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt, North China Craton	High-pressure mafic granulites from the Jiaobei massif in the southern segment of the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt (JLJB) situating in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton (NCC) were examined based on an integrated study of petrology, mineral chemistry and pseudosection modeling. Microstructural relationships of the high-pressure mafic granulites indicate four metamorphic stages, including the pre-peak (M1) stage indicated by garnet core. +. inclusion-phase minerals of hornblende. +. clinopyroxene. +. plagioclase. +. quartz ± epidote ± rutile, the peak (M2) stage featured by garnet mantle/rim. +. matrix-phase minerals of clinopyroxene. +. plagioclase. +. quartz ± rutile, the post-peak (M3) stage characterized by the clinopyroxene. +. plagioclase. +. orthopyroxene symplectite, and the retrograde (M4) stage represented by the hornblende. +. plagioclase symplectite and symplectic clinopyroxene. +. ilmenite. +. quartz. By applying the THERMOCALC (Version 3.33) technique in the NCFMASHTO system, the P-T conditions are estimated at 9.4-9.8. kbar and 690-702 °C for the pre-peak (M1) stage, 13.1-15.1. kbar and 780-890 °C for the peak (M2) stage, 7.8-8.4. kbar and 820-880 °C for the post-peak (M3) stage and the 6.4-7.2. kbar and 690-760 °C for the retrograde (M4) stage. These mineral assemblages and their P-T conditions define a clockwise P-T path for the high-pressure mafic granulites in the Jiaobei massif, suggesting that the rocks underwent near-isothermal decompression and subsequent cooling after the peak metamorphism, which implies that the southern segment of the JLJB must have experienced subduction-/collision-related tectonic processes at ca. 1.93-1.90. Ga. Therefore, the Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt may represent another Paleoproterozoic collisional belt along which the Longgang and Langrim Blocks amalgamated to form the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870548008	Cenozoic tectonic migration and basin evolution in East Asia and its continental margins	Tectonic migration is common geological process of basin formation and development. However, little is known for tectonic migration on the Western Pacific margins. This paper focuses on the representative regions of East China and its surrounding seas in the Western Pacific domain to discuss Cenozoic tectonic migration and mechanism based on our and previous structural results of the Bohai Bay Basin, South Yellow Sea Basin, East China Sea Shelf Basin and South China Sea Basin and others. The Western Pacific active continental margin is the eastern margin of global convergent system located in the junction among the Eurasia Plate, the Pacific Plate and the India Plate. Under the effects of the India-Eurasia collision and retrogressive or roll-back subduction of the Pacific Plate, the Western Pacific active continental margin has a wide basin-arc-trench system which migrated and jumped eventually seaward and eastward. The migration and jumping are characterized by progressive eastward younging of faulting, sedimentation, depression, termination in and/or within basins, and generation, reservoir, seal, trap, migration and preservation of hydrocarbon and gashydrate. Due to the tectonic migration, the conditions related to hydrocarbon and gashydrate accumulation of East China and its adjacent lands and seas also get younger from west to east, and such a spatio-temporal distribution of Cenozoic hydrocarbon and gashydrate is significant for the oil and gas exploration in East China. Finally, this paper discusses the mechanism of Cenozoic intrabasinal and interbasinal tectonic migration in terms of interplate, intraplate and underplating processes. The migration or jumping mechanism of tectonism-magmatism-basin foramtion- hydrocarbon-gashydrate accumulation is the Late Mesozoic extrusion tectonics and the Cenozoic NW-directed crustal extension, the regional far-field eastward flow of the western asthenosphere due to the India-Eurasia plate collision accompanying with eastern jumping and back-rolling of subduction zones of the Pacific Plate.

84870584977	Yanshanian fold-thrust tectonics and dynamics in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River area, China	The Middle-Lower Yangtze River area is one of famous copper, iron and polymetallic ore metallogenic belts in China. In this paper, the Middle-Lower Yangtze River area is divided into the five tectonic units: the North China Block, the Dabie Orogenic Belt, the Yangtze Block, the Cathaysia Block, the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Foreland Belt. Furthermore, the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Foreland Belt is subdividied into three subunits: the Baokang-Wuhan- Susong-Chaohu Fold-and-thrust Belt, the Daye-Huaining-Wuhu Mesozoic Depression, the Tongshan-Ruichang-Ningguo Fold-and-thrust Belt. In the Early Yanshanian, the Wuhan-Susong-Chaohu Fold-and-thrust Belt north of the Yangtze River underwent the SE-directed thrusting: while the Ruichang-Ningguo Fold-andthrust Belt south of the Yangtze River experienced the NW-directed thrusting. South of the Yueyang-Puji-Xianning-Yangxin, the fold styles from north to south varies from chevron anticlines to chevron synclines, and the imbricate thrust faults to the south are more developed. The Jiuling-Mufushan Basement and the basements of the Cretaceous red basins developed many high-angle thrust faults and chevron synclines. The Proterozoic metamorphic rocks are involved in this thrusting, showing a typical thick-skinned structure. In the north of the Yangtze River, the closed asymmetric folds are mostly developed in the Indosinian. The Early Yanshanian thrusting modified the pre-exsiting structures. The deep and shallow structures north of the Yangtze River are coupling. However, the deep and shallow structures south of the Yangtze River are decoupling. The architecture of the upper and lower crust looks like "fish-spur" over the Middle-Lower Yangtze River. These deep structures should be the residual effect of the Indosinian subduction of the Yangtze Block to the North China Block. In the Middle-Lower Yangtze River, the south-directed thrusting should be related to the slow extrusion of the UHP metamorphic rocks in the Dabie Orogenic Belt. However, the northwest-directed thrusting may be related with the Middle Jurassic subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate to the Asian Continent.

84873601180	Seismic imaging of the Southwest Japan arc from the Nankai trough to the Japan Sea	Detailed three-dimensional P- and S-wave velocity (Vp and Vs) models of the entire Southwest Japan arc from the Nankai trough to the Japan Sea are determined for the first time using a large number of high-quality arrival-time data from local earthquakes. The suboceanic earthquakes used in the tomographic inversion were relocated precisely using sP depth phase data. Our results show that strong lateral heterogeneities exist in the interplate megathrust zone under the Nankai forearc. Large interplate earthquakes mainly occurred in or around high-velocity (high-V) patches in the megathrust zone. These high-V patches may represent asperities formed by the subducted oceanic ridges and seamounts. Low-velocity (low-V) zones in the megathrust zone may contain sediments and fluids associated with slab dehydration and so become weakly coupled areas. Our results also show that the coseismic slip distributions of some megathrust earthquakes are not limited in the high-V patches (asperities) where the ruptures initiated. Because of the weak interplate coupling in the low-V areas, the rupture of an interplate earthquake could unimpededly pass through the low-V anomalies and so result in a great megathrust earthquake. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874996685	Amalgamation of the North China Craton: Key issues and discussion	Geological and geophysical data indicate that the Precambrian basement of the North China Craton (NCC) formed by amalgamation of a number of micro-continental blocks. The number of blocks, when they existed and how they came together are controversial, and in particular the following issues are disputed: (1) the timing of collisional event(s) leading to the amalgamation of the Eastern and Western blocks along the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO); (2) the polarity of the subduction between the Eastern and Western blocks; (3) the validity of an old continental block (Fuping Block) that collided with the Eastern Block at ~2.1Ga; (4) the tectonic setting of the northern margin of the NCC in the Paleoproterozoic; (5) the tectonic nature of high-pressure (HP) and ultrahigh temperature (UHT) granulite-facies events in the Khondalite Belt of the Western Block; and (6) the tectonic setting of the Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt in the Eastern Block.Analysis and integration of available stratigraphic, structural, geochemical, metamorphic and geochronologic data enable the development of an internally consistent and coherent model for assembly and stabilization of the various Archean blocks of the NCC in the Paleoproterozoic. All metamorphic ages obtained for the TNCO are around 1.85Ga, which establishes that the final amalgamation of the Western and Eastern blocks of the craton occurred at ~1.85Ga. The TNCO is characterized by a fan-shaped pattern of structural features, with the top-to-the-NW and top-to-the-SE thrusting in the northwest and southeast, respectively. This pattern does not constrain subduction polarity for the collisional assembly of the Eastern and Western blocks. Structures in lithospheric mantle and asthenosphere in the TNCO have been significantly modified/replaced in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and hence the present-day orientation of these structures, even if they relate to Paleoproterozoic assembly of the craton cannot be used to infer associated subduction polarity. There are no unique structural data or available metamorphic data to supporting the existence of an old continental block that intervened between the Eastern and Western Blocks, which collided with the Eastern Block at ~2.1Ga. Available data are also inconsistent with the existence of the Paleoproterozoic Inner Mongolia-North Hebei Orogen along the northern margin of the NCC that formed through accretion of an exotic arc at ~2.3Ga and incorporated into the Paleoproterozoic Columbia (Nuna) Supercontinent at 1.92-1.85Ga. We interpret the north Hebei portion of this inferred orogen as part of the TNCO, and the Inner Mongolian portion as an independent continental block (Yinshan Block). This block is separated from the Ordos Block by the Paleoproterozoic Khondalite Belt. The high-/medium-pressure granulite facies metamorphic event in the Khondalite Belt is considered to have resulted from collision between the Yinshan and Ordos blocks to form the Western Block at ~1.95Ga, whereas the ~1.92Ga UHT metamorphism within the belt was related to the underplating or intrusion of mantle-derived magmas during the post-collisional extension. The Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt in the Eastern Block likely formed through Paleoproterozoic rifting to form the Longgang and Langrim blocks, and subsequent basin closure and collision in the period 2.2-1.9Ga. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

84876299703	Zircon UPb geochronology and Hf isotopes of major lithologies from the Yishui Terrane: Implications for the crustal evolution of the Eastern Block, North China Craton	As an important component of the Western Shandong Complex in the Eastern Block of the North China Craton, the Yishui Terrane consists of Neoarchean high-grade supracrustal rocks, granitoid gneisses and charnockites. LA-ICP-MS zircon UPb dating and Hf isotopic analyses on these lithologies have been carried out and the results provide new insights into the Neoarchean crustal evolution of the Eastern Block of the North China Craton. New zircon dating results reveal that the magmatic precursors of the supracrustal metapelites and granitoid gneisses were generated at 2.54-2.53Ga and 2.57-2.55Ga, respectively, and the charnockites were emplaced contemporaneously around 2.56-2.53Ga. Single metamorphic zircon grains and overgrowth rims from these rocks document consistent metamorphic ages at ~2.50Ga, suggesting that the Yishui Terrane experienced a high-grade metamorphic event at the end of the Neoarchean.

84878588816	UPb zircon age and geochemical constraints on tectonic evolution of the Paleozoic accretionary orogenic system in the Tongbai orogen, central China	The Tongbai orogen is located in a key tectonic position linking the Qinling orogen to the west and the Dabie-Sulu orogen to the east. This orogen comprises a Paleozoic accretionary orogenic system in the north and a Permo-Triassic collisional orogenic system in the south; hence it may serve as an ideal place to unravel the tectonic evolution from the initial oceanic subduction/accretion to the final continental collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons. U. Pb zircon geochronology of metasedimentary and metaigneous rocks and geochemical characterization of metabasalts indicate a close genetic relationship between the individual tectonic units of the Paleozoic accretionary orogenic system: (1) the Kuanping Group as a Neoproterozoic-Ordovician subduction-accretion complex which received sediments from the Qinling microcontinent, (2) the Erlangping Group and Huanggang diorite-granodiorite complex as an Ordovician-Silurian island arc evolving from backarc basin, (3) the Qinling Group as a Precambrian microcontinent converted into continental arc during the Ordovician, (4) the Guishan Complex as a mixture of the Qinling continental arc and Devonian forearc sediments, and (5) the Nanwan Flysch as a Devonian forearc sequence deposited on the newly accreted active margin of the Sino-Korean craton. Consequently, the northern and southern boundaries of the Paleozoic accretionary orogenic system represent two sutures of the Qinling microcontinent with the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons. The new and previously published data reveal that the tectonic evolution of the Tongbai orogen involved a series of events from Ordovician-Early Silurian (ca 490-440 Ma) oceanic subduction and arc magmatism, Silurian-Early Devonian (ca. 440-400. Ma) arc-continent collision, Carboniferous (ca 340-310 Ma) oceanic subduction and accretion, Late Permian-Triassic (ca 260-200 Ma) continental subduction and collision, to Cretaceous (ca. 140-90. Ma) extension and lateral eastward extrusion. The entire accretionary orogenic processes until the final collision between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze cratons may have lasted more than 200.

84878838713	Numerical modeling on the stress field in the Huanghua depression, Bohai Bay basin	The present-day stress field of the Huanghua Depression is anlysized using finite element modeling (FEM). The models are constructed based on 3D seismic data, which consists of bottom surfaces of seven sequences and near-real spatial occurrences of faults in the depression. Comparing with the distribution of oil-gas reserviors and fault patterns around the area of the reservoirs, we quantitatively explain the distribution characteristics of the first/third principal stresses, stress intensity and direction of principal stresses. Then, the main factors influencing the structural features of the Huanghua Depression are discussed accordingly. The faults in the model are introduced as Coulomb-type frictional zones that refer to contact analysis of FEM. The results are as followed: 1) by adjusting the boundary conditions of the models, we find out that under the left-lateral shearing, the third principal stresses and the orientations of principal stresses show certain correlation with the position of five oil-gas reserviors and fault strikes in the Huanghua Depression, respectively. 2) There are differences in the structural patterns and the directions of structural stress field of the the Huanghua Depression from north to south, which closely relate to the spatial occurrences of the Cangdong Fault, fault pattern, types and the spatial change of detachment fault.

84883469072	Active tectonics in the Central North China Block and the cause of the formation of the Fenwei Graben	The study area is located in the center of the North China Craton which was affected by two global domains: the Paleo-Pacific and the Tethys tectonic domains. In the Cenozoic, the North China Craton was under destruction, and the Bohai Bay Basin and the Fenwei Graben developed. Until now, the activity of the North China Craton is still increasing and different trending faults and basins show different activities. The NW-trending and EW-trending strike-slipping faults are sinistral. The NE-trending faults are predominantly normal. Though the NNE-trending faults display normal, the slip components are gradually obvious. Therefore the NE-trending basins show activity different from that of the NNE-trending basins in the Fenwei Graben. In the Quaternary, the sedimentation rates of the NNE-trending grabens are larger than those of the NE-trending grabens, though there was no difference of the sedimentation rates when the basins were formed. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the uplifting mountains in the North China Block happened in the same period. This paper proposes that the active tectonics in the center of the North China Block since the Miocene was mainly impacted by a far-field extrusion resulting from the collision of the Indian Plate to the Eurasian Plate. The extrusion caused the NE-trending dextral shearing and the NWW-trending sinistral shearing that played a role in the activities of the center of the North China Block. The join effect of those shearing resulted in the destruction in the north and south parts of the North China Block in the Miocene. The acceleration of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplifting caused two shearing events having different amplitudes, the resultant force also switched from the NW-trending extension to the NNW-trending extension, and transferred its impact to the east and north parts of the study area, resulting in the development of grabens, the variation of activity of faults with different strikes, and the migration of the subsidence centers and depocenter since the Pliocene.

84883469910	Neotectonic activity and its kinematics of fault system in the south of North China Block	According to field observations, measurement and analysis of active faults, especially synthesizing morphological and structural evidence for the Quaternary activity of these faults in the south of North China Block, this paper suggests that the NWW-NW-trending faults are strong active in the North China Block, and featured by left strike-slipping. The Sanmenxia-Lushan-Wuyang Fault inherited from the Pre-Cenozoic fault; the Xinxiang-Shangqiu Faults developed in neotectonic period are Cenozoic intra-crustal faults with sinistral strike-slip component. The geophysical data indicate that there are two NW-trending tectonic and earthquake belts in the deep crustal structure of the northern part of the Jiexiu-Xinxiang-Liyang and Badang-Quanzhou-Taiwan earthquake belts, which may have merged into a big one in the mantle. According to spatial distribution of these faults and the related basins, this paper presents a kinematic model of pull-apart basin to clarify the kinematic relations of the NE, the NW- and EW-trending faults in the study area. The two NW-trending tectonic and earthquake belts show sinistral strike-slipping which resulted in pull-apart basins in the south of North China Block and the pre-existing EW- and NNE-trending faults reactivated and some new NW-trending faults developed. Therefore, the complex Cenozoic faults are characterized by block faulting under the control of stress field, strain field and the basement structural framework.

84883485634	The intraplate morphotectonic inversion along the Eastern Taihang Mountain Fault Zone, North China and its mechanism	The North China Craton can be divided into the Western and Eastern Blocks separated by the Trans-North China Orogen. Since the Mesozoic, the North China Craton underwent thinning and destruction. The destruction center is located in the Eastern Block, whereas the Western Block and the north-trending Trans-North China Orogen remained their integrity, and the transition zone between them is the eastern Taihang Mountains. Two subparallel important faults developed in the Taihang Mountain region, called the Taihang Mountain Large Fault and the Eastern Taihang Mountain Fault respectively, as the major faults of the Eastern Taihang Mountain Fault Belt. Previous studies revealed that the Eastern Taihang Mountain Fault is inherited from Precambrian tectonic belts controlling the differences of Precambrian crystalline basements between the Eastern Block and the Taihang Mountain Region. Since the Palaeocene, the Eastern Taihang Mountain Fault developed into negative morphotectonic inversion as a normal fault in the western margin of the Bohai Bay Basin. However, the Taihang Mountain Large Fault existed in the Yanshanian as a major thrust, and played an important role in the uplift of the Taihang Mountains. During the middle Miocene, along with the formation of the Shanxi graben system, the Taihang Mountain Large Fault underwent a negative structural inversion and controlled the development of a series of intermontane grabens. Since the Cenozoic, the tectonic migration in this region as a whole jumped toward the west, developing under regional strike-slipping and extension a new intraplate mountain-basin relationship.

84883556698	Mesozoic to Cenozoic intracontinental deformation and dynamics of the North China Craton	Since the Mesozoic, the North China Craton has been located at a triangular junction surrounded by subduction or collision zones. This craton thus marks the frontier of a super-convergent regime. Within the super-convergence tectonic domains, however, distinct extensional regimes operated in the Meso-Cenozoic Bohai Bay Basin located at the eastern part of the North China Craton. In this synthesis, we focus on the intracontinental dynamics during the Mesozoic to Cenozoic in the North China Craton. Whereas the deep structures as revealed from tomographic studies show a remarkable difference between the Western and Eastern blocks of the North China Craton, the shallow setting in both regions is characterized by super-convergence. We propose here that the tectonic scenario of the Bohai Bay Basin developed during the destruction of the North China Craton is largely characterized by Mesozoic extrusion and Cenozoic NW-directed intracrustal extension with pull-apart. The Cenozoic deep process is mainly a regional far-field eastward upwelling of the asthenosphere beneath the western tectonic domain due to the India-Eurasia Plate collision accompanied by the eastward jump and rollback of the subducting Pacific Plate. The deep processes under the Bohai Bay Basin in the Mesozoic are local delamination and magma underplating. Our study highlights the contrasting structural and tectonic signature developed in the frontier of one of the largest super-convergent systems on the globe. © 2013 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, we document the characteristics and distribution of a previously unrecognized sequence of lacustrine turbidite sandstones from the Dongying Sag in the Bohai Bay Basin, North China Craton. The Eocene Shahejie Formation in the Dongying Sag has been previously interpreted as a shallow lacustrine deposit, such as a deltaic system, with delta-front to sag and back-barrier environments. However, the numerous sandstone layers associated with the third member (Es3) of the Shahejie Formation define an integrated deep-water turbidite system. Analysis of the characteristics of lithofacies, seismic facies and wire-line logs of the sandstone layers has been undertaken, as well as investigation of the distribution characteristics and the factors governing the development of these sandstones. The results from our study show that the development of this turbidite sequence was controlled by a number of parameters including sediment supply, accommodation of the sag, palaeo-topography, hydrodynamics, scale and formation of the delta, subsidence rate of the sedimentary basin, and tectonic activity associated with the Jiyang Movement during the Cenozoic destruction of the North China Craton. © 2013 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

Three test fault activity formulas for those different models were given to calculate vertical displacements of the major faults during the Indosinian, the Yanshanian and the Himalayan periods. The results show that the thrusting in Huoshizhen sag is intensive during the Indosinian period, but became weaker and weaker during the Yanshanian period, the activity of fault enhanced only in the south boundary during the Himalayan period. While the thrusting in Sanbao sag initiated during the Indosinian period, and became more intensive during the Yanshanian period, then terminated during the Himalayan period. Differentiation of the fault activity in different sags directly control the formation and evolution of the structural patterns in these sags. The tectonic framework of Huoshizhen sag basically developed during the Indo-china movement, while that of Sanbao sag finally developed after the Yanshanian movement.

For this purpose, here we conduct a multi-disciplinary investigation and combine it with the previous studies to reassess the tectonics and evolution of SCC and propose that the tectonic framework of the continent comprises two blocks, three types of tectonic units, four deformation systems, and four evolutionary stages with distinctive mechanism and tectonic characteristics since the Neoproterozoic. The four evolutionary stages are: (1) The amalgamation and break-up of the Neoproterozoic plates, typically the intracontinental rifting. (2) The early Paleozoic and Mesozoic intracontinental orogeny confined by plate tectonics, forming two composite tectonic domains. (3) The parallel operation of the Yangtze cratonization and intracontinental orogeny, and multi-phase reactivation of the Yangtze craton.

84889662820	Structural characteristics of NWW-trending active fault zones in East China: A case study of the Zhangjiakou-Penglai Fault Zone	The NE-trending fault zones in East China have been well known. However, the NWW-trending fault zones are poorly known. Especially these NWW-trending fault zones are characterized by neotectonic activities. Taking the Zhangjiakou-Penglai Fault Zone as an example, this paper carries out a detailed analysis of the NWW-trending active faults in geometry, kinematics, dynamics and earthquake activities. The results show that these NWW-trending faults are sinistral strike-slipping faults controlling some en echelon Quaternary pull-apart basins. These faults have triggered plenty of earthquakes as the seismogenic structures. All these structural features result from the differential activities in dynamics among the neighboring blocks as a response to the various deformations of different segments along the plate boundaries. Under the combining effect of the other surrounding plates around China, the NWW-trending faults in North China and the south part of South China are possibly dominated by the collision of the Indian Plate to the Eurasian Plate. However, the NWW-trending faults in Northeast China and the east part of South China are possibly dominated by the subduction of the Pacific Plate.

The volume variations of the accretionary prism, the forearc slope angle, taper angle variations support the segmentation of the Manila subduction system. The accretionary prism is composed of the outer wedge and the inner wedge separated by the slope break. The backstop structure and a 0.5-1 km thick subduction channel are interpreted in the seismic Line 973 located in the northeastern South China Sea. The clear décollement horizon reveals the oceanic sediment has been subducted beneath the accretionary prism. A number of splay faults occur in the active outer wedge. Taper angles vary from 8.0° ± 1° in the North Luzon segment, 9.9° ± 1° in the seamount segment to 11° ± 1° in the West Luzon segment. Based on variations between the taper angle and orthogonal convergence rates in the world continental margins and comparison between our results and the global compilation, different segments of the Manila subduction system fit well the global pattern. It suggests that subduction accretion dominates the north Luzon and seamount chain segment, but the steep slope indicates in the West Luzon segment and implies that tectonic erosion could dominate the West Luzon segment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

This study presents new zircon LA-ICP-MS U-Pb and Lu-Hf isotopic data for these lithologies, which help to better understand the Archean crustal evolution of the Eastern Block of the NCC. Magmatic zircon U-Pb data reveal that zircons in the supracrustal rocks and granitoid gneisses were generated by multi-stage events at ~2.9Ga, ~2.7Ga and ~2.5Ga. Metamorphic zircon U-Pb data obtained for these rocks show distinct metamorphic ages at ~2.50 and ~1.9-1.8Ga, suggesting that the Jiaodong Terrane experienced a regional metamorphic event at the end of the Neoarchean and encountered reworking by a tectonothermal event that was associated with the formation of the Paleoproterozoic Jiao-Liao-Ji Belt.

84892472194	Numerical modeling of present-day structural stress of major active blocks in the Asian continent	The Late Cenozoic and present-day deformation of the Asian continent is characterized by rigid motions of active blocks with different motion patterns and velocities. To research different structural deformation and interaction among these active-blocks, we establish four different finite element numerical models based on the tectonic framework of the Asian continent. By comparing the modeling result with the GPS data, focal mechanism solution and geological survey, we quantitatively explain the distribution characteristics of the principal stresses. Then, the major factors influencing the present-day deformation of the Asian continent are discussed accordingly. The results are summarized as followings. Velocity of active blocks movements in the Western China mainland was influenced by the continuous northward compression of the Indian plate gradually decreasing from south to north across a series of lithospheric-scale active tectonic zones. This kind of variety can change stress environment from compressional-tensional area in the central Tibet to completely compressional area in the Tarim basin and the Tianshan Mountain. In the model, the calculated stress of the North China block displays very weak compressional environment, but the seismicity and extensional structures extensively developed in the inner North China block. This puzzle probably means that deep dynamics cause the North China block reactive. Because of the compression between the India plate and the Philippines plate, the motion senses of the South China block and the Taiwan orogenic belt are opposite, resulting in the formation of strong compressional-tensional domain south of the Qinling-Dabie orogenic belt. As "extrusion window" of the South China and the Indochina block, the Sunda block shows particular stress distribution, which has an arc-shaped weak compressional area centered by the South China Sea and there is a relatively strong compressional-tensional area around it.

It can be subdivided into the altered-rock type in the fracture zone, gold-bearing quartz vein type, stockwork quartz vein type along the fracture zone, quartz-sulphide vein type, interlayer type along the detachment belt, altered-conglomerate type and breccia type along the basin margin faults. These types of gold mineralization took place mainly in the Early Cretaceous period. The ore-forming materials were derived from an intensive crust-mantle interaction. The Early Precambrian and Mesozoic ore-hosting rocks were experienced generally phyllic, pyritization, silicification and potassic alteration. Gold bodies are characterized by pinch out, branches, composite, repetition, lateral extension, lateral tilting, echelon and imbrication. The uplifting of hot magma, fluid activities and extensional detachment resulted in the massive formation of gold deposits in Jiaodong Peninsula. The coeval-melted segregation magma and activated fluids derived from the Early Cretaceous crust-mantle interaction are important carriers of migration and enrichment of gold materials. The extensional detachment resulted from magma uplifting provided favorable ore-hosting spaces for the gold mineralization. Therefore, a thermal uplifting-extension-controlled metallogenic theory is proposed. The Jiaojia-style gold deposit was caused by the large-scale thinning of the lithosphere in the Early Cretaceous period in the Eastern China, being controlled by extensional tectonics. The ore-controlling faults have the ladder-style variation from steep to gentle dip angles. The gold deposits are emplaced and enriched at the gentle angle fault segments and the break part from steep to gentle dip angles, displaying a ladder-like distribution pattern.

84896547403	Numerical modeling of Late Miocene tectonic inversion in the Xihu Sag, East China Sea Shelf Basin, China	The East China Sea Shelf Basin is an important oil- and gas-bearing basin in the West Pacific continental margin. This region was affected by subduction of the Pacific Plate and the Philippine Plate in Cenozoic and experienced multi-stage tectonic inversions. This paper presents results from a numerical simulation by finite element method to the Xihu Sag in the East China Sea Shelf Basin and neighboring areas in an attempt to evaluate the WNW-directed compression on the sag during Late Miocene. Based on comprehensive structural analysis of a large number of seismic profiles, we determine the structural geometry of the sag, including the basement of the basin, the sedimentary cover, and 29 major faults in the Xihu Sag. Simulation results show that under continuous WNW-directed compression, tectonic inversion occurred firstly in the Longjing and Yuquan tectonic zones in the sag. Based on quantitative analysis of vertical displacement field of the Xihu Sag and peripheral areas and its stress intensity evolution, we identify a compressional regime in the Longjing Anticline Zone with a gradually propagated uplifting from south to north; whereas the propagation of uplifting in the Yuquan Anticline Zone is from north to south. The inversion intensity decreases from north to south. The formation of the tectonic inversion zone in the Xihu Sag is not only correlated to the direction of compression and fault patterns in the basin, but also closely related to the spatial configuration of fault surfaces of the Xihu-Jilong Fault in the Xihu Sag. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84897825199	Mesozoic tectonic migration in the eastern Junggar Basin	Tectonic migration is a common geological process during basin formation and development. However, little is known about the tectonic migration in the eastern Junggar Basin. This paper focuses on the eastern part of the Junggar Basin to discuss Mesozoic tectonic migration and its mechanism based on our interpretation of seismic profiles and previous structural results in the eastern part of the Junggar Basin. The eastern Junggar Basin was under intraplate setting in Mesozoic-Cenozoic. Under the southward indentation of the Siberian Plate, the tectonic migration was characterized by progressively southward propagating of faulting, sedimentation, depression, termination of faulting in the basin. Finally, this paper discusses the mechanism and processes of Mesozoic tectonic migration from interplate to intraplate. The migration mechanism of the tectonism-sedimentation-basin formation is related to the Mesozoic extrusion tectonics of the basement of the Junggar Basin and the southward indentation of the Mesozoic Siberian Block.

84898872153	Intracontinental orogenic transition: Insights from structures of the eastern Junggar Basin between the Altay and Tianshan orogens	Detailed subsurface structure of the eastern Junggar Basin is investigated using a large number of high-resolution two-dimensional reflection seismic profiles and well data. Our results reveal thrust faults, some of which are with strike-slip component, and fault-related folds dominating the subsurface structure of the study area. The thrust faults mainly show a divergent pattern towards the west and convergence towards the east. We divide these thrust faults and folds into three structural systems. The north thrust system, located in the north of the study area, is characterized by top-to-the southwest imbricate thrusts initiated from late Paleozoic. The central transpression system, dominating the central study area, mainly consists of thrust faults with visible strike-slip component, active from early Mesozoic until Cretaceous. The South thrust system includes top-to-the southeast thrusts in the southern part of the study area. The existence of these structural systems indicates that the eastern Junggar Basin underwent obvious intracontinental deformation in Mesozoic, probably due to the continuous convergence between the Altay and the Tianshan orogens after the main collision-accretion processes of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84899680178	Active tectonics and its effects on gas-hydrates in northern South China Sea	Submarine gas hydrates are closely related to active tectonics. Recently submarine active tectonics in the northern South China Sea attract much attention because of exploration of submarine gashydrate in the past decades. We descript the features of faults, earthquakes, and volcanic activity and other active tectonics relating to gashydrate. There are three sets of active faults including NE-, NEE-EW-, NW-striking faults in the northern South China Sea, of which NW-trending faults cut the other two groups. Most of these active faults are inherited from pre-existing basement faults. NE- and ENE-trending faults are crustal or lithospheric faults. The earthquake distribution is focused on a NE-trending striped region of the northern South China Sea. However, the NW-trending earthquakes are controlled by the Red River strike-slipping fault. Gas chimneys are related to active structures that play an important role of the formation of the gashydrates, as same as the channel which provides the gas to vertically migrate up to the place under appropriate temperature and pressure for gas-hydrate formation. The distribution of volcanic rocks clockwise rotates from east to west. Based on seismic profile, the volcanic rocks are controlled by tensional fault. The distribution of gashydrates in the eastern part is affected by the NW-trending active faults, however, the west is inextricably linked with the submarine landslide.

84899704047	Seismic attenuation tomography of the Northeast Japan arc: Insight into the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (M	Detailed three-dimensional (3-D) P and S wave attenuation (Qp and Qs) models of the crust and upper mantle under the entire Northeast Japan (Tohoku) arc from the Japan Trench to the Japan Sea coast are determined, for the first time, using a large number of high-quality t* data measured precisely from P and S wave spectra of local earthquakes. The suboceanic earthquakes used in this work are relocated precisely using sP depth phases. Our results reveal a prominent landward dipping high-Q zone representing the subducting Pacific slab, a landward dipping intermediate- To high-Q zone in the mantle wedge between the Pacific coast and the volcanic front, and significant low-Q anomalies in the crust and mantle wedge between the volcanic front and the Japan Sea coast. Prominent high-Q patches surrounded by low-Q anomalies are revealed in the interplate megathrust zone under the Tohoku fore arc where the great 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (M

84902080237	Time sequence of submarine landslides and gas hydrates in the northern South China Sea	As a common depositional process, the submarine landslides widely developed in the continental slopes. Although the co-existence of submarine landslides gas-hydate is common, very little is known about the relationship between the submarine landslides and the formation of gas-hydrates. The previous study on submarine landslides and gas-hydrates mainly focused on composition, nature, identification, and the triggering mechanism of the submarine landslides, and the spatial relationship between the gas-hydrate and submarine landslides. However, the study of time sequence and the relation between gas hydrate and submarine landslide is still less known. Due to the limitation of available data, this paper gives a preliminary qualitative study. The results show that submarine landslides can be divided into three types: post-gas hydrate landslide, pre-gas hydrate landslide, and syn-gas hydrate landslide according to time sequence. The different types of landslides have different effects on the preservation and exploitation of the gas-hydrates. The pre-gas hydrate landslides are most favorable for the preservation and exploitation of the gas-hydrate, while the syn-gas hydrate landslides are the secondary favorable sites.

84906806296	Extension of NE-trending faults in south China to northern south China Sea continental shelf	The northern continental margin of the South China Sea hosts numerous oil- and gas-bearing basins, the northern South China Sea Continental Slope, in particular, is characterized by enrichment of gas hydrate. Detailed investigations into the propagation of NE-trending faults in South China to the northern continental margin of the South China Sea and the clarification of the overall structural pattern have a very important significance for understanding the earthquakes, resource exploration, tectonic evolution and dynamics in the northern South China Sea. Based on the interpretation of gravity and magnetic anomalies, two-dimensional seismic profiles as well as earthquake activity and tectonomorphological analysis, we find that the structural characteristics of the major NE-trending faults in the South China Sea and the South China Block are similar, the four major faults, namely the Binhai Fault, the Changle-Nan'ao Fault, the Zhenghe-Dabu Fault and the Shaowu-Heyuan-Yangjiang Fault developed in the South China Block and extended into the northern South China Sea. The four main faults that extend to the northern South China Sea controlled the development of the basins, i.e., the Binhai Fault is the eastern boundary of the Zhu'er Depression; the Changle-Nan'ao Fault across the Zhujiangkou Basin; the Zhenghe-Dabu Fault is located at the western boundary of the Zhuyi and Zhu'er depressions and the eastern boundary of the Beijiao Depression, the Shaowu-Heyuan-Yangjiang Fault is the western boundary of the Qiongdongnan Basin. These basins in the South China Block and the northern South China Sea are similar in formation regime as pull-apart basins. The NE-trending dextral strike-slip faults in the northern continental margin of the South China Sea controlled the development of these basins, and the NEE-trending faults controlled the filling pattern of the depressions.

84916203211	Formation machanism of the Beibuwan basin, South China	The formation model of pull apart with stepwise dextral strike-slipping of the Beibuwan basin is proposed based on its regional geological background, geometric pattern, basinal boundaries, faulting in the basin, migration of depocenter and internal structures in the basin. The formation and development of the basin is controlled by right stepping fault pattern composed of the Hepu-Beiliu, the Xinyi-Lianjiang, the Wuchuan-Sihui and the Yangjiang-Heyuan fault belts. Flower-like structures developed in the Paleogene show that the basin experienced transtension and consequent structural inversion under transpression in Neogene. This mechanism is simultaneous and similar with Mesozoic-Cenozoic pull-apart basins in South China. The pre-existing deep-seated strike-slipping faults in the basement of the basin are the precedent geological conditions for the formation of the Beibuwan basin in Cenozoic. However, the fundamental factors controlling the formation of the Beibuwan basin are gradual increase of collision of the Indian-Australia to the Eurasia plates coupled with the subduction of the Pacific Plate.

84918797686	A synthesis of geochemistry and Sm-Nd isotopes of Archean granitoid gneisses in the Jiaodong Terrane: Constraints on petrogenesis and tectonic evolution of the Eastern Block, North China Craton	The Jiaodong Terrane is situated in the northeastern part of the Shandong Province in eastern China, experiencing multi-stage magmatism during the Mesoarchean (~2.9Ga) and Neoarchean (~2.7Ga and ~2.5Ga). It consists dominantly of granitoid gneisses with minor amphibolite enclaves or lenses. This study presents new whole-rock geochemical and Sm-Nd isotopic data for the Archean granitoid gneisses from the Jiaodong Terrane in order to constrain their petrogenesis and tectonic setting. Geochemical studies and petrological features suggest that the protoliths of most granitoid gneisses are typical Archean tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic (TTG) suites, which are high in SiO
