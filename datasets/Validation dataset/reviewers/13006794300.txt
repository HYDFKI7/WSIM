84949116207	Generalized finite difference method for solving two-dimensional Burgers' equations	In this paper, the two-dimensional Burgers' equations are numerically analyzed by a meshfree numerical scheme, which is a combination of the implicit Euler method, the generalized finite difference method (GFDM) and the fictitious time integration method (FTIM). Since both of the convective and the diffusive terms simultaneously appear in the time-dependent quasi-linear Burgers' equations, it is necessary and very difficult to develop a reliable numerical scheme to solve it. The GFDM, which can truly get rid of time-consuming mesh generation and numerical quadrature, and the implicit Euler method are used for spatial and temporal discretization, respectively. Then, the resultant system of nonlinear algebraic equations for every time step is resolved by the newly-developed FTIM. Since, in comparing with the Newton's method, the calculation of the inverse of Jacobian matrix can be avoided in the FTIM, to adopt the FTIM for solving the system of nonlinear algebraic equations is very efficient and has great potential for large-scale engineering problems. Some numerical results and comparisons are provided to validate the accuracy and the simplicity of the proposed meshfree scheme.

84949122158	Applications of the local RBF collocation method and the fictitious time integration method for Burgers' equations	In this paper, a meshfree numerical scheme, which is a combination of the local RBF (radial basis function) collocation method (LRBFCM) and the fictitious time integration method (FTIM), is proposed to efficiently and accurately analyze the two-dimensional Burgers' equations. The Burgers' equations, which can be regarded as the simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations, are a system of time- and space-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations, so it is very difficult and important to be accurately solved. The LRBFCM, one of newly-developed meshfree methods, is adopted for spatial discretization and, at the meantime, the implicit Euler method is used for temporal discretization. Then, the system of nonlinear algebraic equations at every time step will be efficiently resolved by the FTIM, which can avoid the calculation of the Jacobian matrix. The numerical results and comparisons of one numerical example will be provided to validate the accuracy and the efficiency of the proposed meshfree numerical scheme.

16244378860	Method of fundamental solutions for stokes' first and second problems	This paper describes the applications of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) as a mesh-free numerical method for the Stokes' first and second problems which prevail in the semi-infinite domain with constant and oscillatory velocity at the boundary in the fluid-mechanics benchmark problems. The time-dependent fundamental solutions for the semi-infinite problems are used directly to obtain the solution as a linear combination of the unsteady fundamental solution of the diffusion operator. The proposed numerical scheme is free from the conventional Laplace transform or the finite difference scheme to deal with the time derivative term of the governing equation. By properly placing the field points and the source points at a given time level, the solution is advanced in time until steady state solutions are reached. It is not necessary to locate and specify the condition at the infinite domain such as other numerical methods. Since the present method does not need mesh discretization and nodal connectivity, the computational effort and memory storage required are minimal as compared to the domain-oriented numerical schemes. Test results obtained for the Stokes' first and second problems show good comparisons with the analytical solutions. Thus the present numerical scheme has provided a promising mesh-free numerical tool to solve the unsteady semi-infinite problems with the space-time unification for the time-dependent fundamental solution.

15544368746	Analysis of elliptical waveguides by the method of fundamental solutions	The present work describes the application of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS)for the solution of cutoff wavelengths of elliptical waveguides. Since the MFS employs a formulation using boundary values only, the cutoff wavelengths are determined by applying the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. The use of the MFS to solve the governing (Helmholtz) equation guarantees a solution without singularities, since it does not use discretized points tu determine the solution at the interior of the computational domain. The combination of the MFS and SVD techniques has resulted in a simpler and efficient numerical solution procedure, as compared to other schemes. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

19944413132	Eigenanalysis for membranes with stringers using the methods of fundamental solutions and domain decomposition	We use a meshless numerical method to analyze the eigenanalysis of thin circular membranes with degenerate boundary conditions, composed by different orientations and structures of stringers. The membrane eigenproblem is studied by solving the two-dimensional Helmholte equation utilizing the method of fundamental solutions and domain decomposition technique as well. The method of singular value decomposition is adopted to obtain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the resulting system of global linear equation. The proposed novel numerical scheme was first validated by three circular membranes which are structured with a single edge stringer, two opposite edge stringers and an internal stringer. Present results for those three cases match very well with the solutions obtained by the analytical approach as well as by methods of dual boundary element, and finite element. The analysis is then extended to solve a completely new problem of a circular membrane with a cross stringer at the center of the membrane. We illustrate the proposed innovative numerical scheme which is simpler and more efficient to solve Helmholtz problems with degenerate boundary conditions. The good features of this scheme are not depending upon the treatments of mesh, singularity, hypersingularity, numerical integration and iterative procedure, which are generally required by other conventional mesh-dependent methods.

The Stokeslets are used as the fundamental solutions to obtain the solution for the flow field by a linear combination of fundamental solutions. Flow results on the cellular structure of flow field resulting from the dynamics of cylinders and the horizontal walls of the cavity are reported for (i) one rotating cylinder in a rectangular cavity with two parallel horizontal sides moving in the same directions as well as in the opposite directions, (ii) two rotating cylinders kept apart in a rectangular cavity with two parallel horizontal sides moving in the same directions as well as in the opposite directions. The effect of aspect ratio of the rectangular cavity, direction of movement of the two parallel horizontal sides of the cavity and the diameter of the rotating cylinder on the flow structure are studied. The flow results obtained for the single cylinder case are in accordance with the results available in the literature. From the computational point of view, the present numerical procedure based on the method of fundamental solutions is efficient and simple to implement as compared to the mesh-dependent schemes, which needs complex mesh generation procedure for the multiply connected geometrical domains considered in this article. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

3142765994	Direct approach to solve nonhomogeneous diffusion problems using fundamental solutions and dual reciprocity methods	This paper describes a combination of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) and the dual reciprocity method (DRM) as a mesh-free numerical method (MFS-DRM model) to solve 2D and 3D nonhomogeneous diffusion problems. Using our method, the homogeneous solutions of the diffusion equations are solved by the MFS, and the DRM, based on the radial basis functions (RBF) of the thin plate splines (TPS), is employed to solve for particular solutions. The present scheme is free from the frequently used Laplace transform and the finite difference discretization method to deal with the time derivative term in the governing equation. By properly placing the source points in the time-space domain, the solution is advanced in time until a steady state solution (if one exists) is reached. Since the present method does not need mesh discretization and nodal connectivity, the computational effort and memory storage required are minimal as compared to other domain-oriented numerical schemes such as FDM, FEM, FVM, etc. Test results obtained for 2D and 3D diffusion problems show good comparability with analytical solutions and other numerical solutions, such as those obtained by the MFS-DRM model based on the modified Helmholtz fundamental solutions. Thus the present numerical scheme has provided a promising meshfree numerical tool to solve nonhomogeneous diffusion problems with space-time unification for diffusion fundamental solutions.

31544464942	The method of fundamental solutions and domain decomposition method for degenerate seepage flownet problems	This paper proposes an innovative method of fundamental solutions (MFS) which is used along with the domain decomposition method (DDM) to solve degenerate boundary problems in ground water flows governed by the Laplace equations. The method is utilized to study flownets generated in the presence of sheet piles, by decomposing regions into sub-domains along the degenerate sheet-pile boundary. After validating two degenerate seepage flownet problems, the method is then applied to solve three practical flownet problems with sheet piles: (1) impermeable dam, (2) semi-circular soil stratum and (3) sloping soil stratum. The predicted flownets show good agreement with available literature. Moreover, the proposed meshless scheme is easier to implement to measure degenerate seepage flownets as compared to other numerical schemes.

In the proposed NSBIE, the conventional treatment of the singular integral for the boundary integral equation is circumvented by employing the Gauss flux theorem and the concept of equipotential. Then the NSBIE for the Helmholtz equation is used to predict the scattering of plane wave by a perfectly electric conducting circular cylinder of infinite length at normal incidence. Based on the good results, as compared with solutions of the analytical and boundary-element methods, it is verified that the NSBIE is a highly simple and efficient numerical scheme for 2D electromagnetic scattering simulations. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33748660424	Global matrix-free finite-element scheme for natural convection in a square cavity with step blockage	A global matrix-free finite-element scheme is proposed for the solution of two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in velocity-vorticity form. By including the boundary conditions of the field variables at the element level itself, the global assembly of matrices is completely eliminated, thus resulting in a significant saving in computer memory. Only the global vectors obtained as a result of matrix-vector products are assembled at the time of solution of the simultaneous equations, using a conjugate gradient iterative solver. The method is validated by solving a benchmark problem on natural convection in a square cavity. The incompressibility constraint of the flow field is satisfied by imposing the vorticity definition at the boundaries using a second-order- accurate Taylor series expansion scheme. Results obtained for natural convection in a square cavity for Rayleigh number 10 3 < Ra < 10 6 indicate excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. The capability of the method to treat complex flow geometries is demonstrated by extending the study to natural convection in a square cavity with an internal square step block positioned on the left wall. Comparison of the memory storage with the compact vector storage scheme is also discussed.

33748453966	MFS with time-dependent fundamental solutions for unsteady Stokes equations	This paper describes the applications of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for 2D and 3D unsteady Stokes equations. The desired solutions are represented by a series of unsteady Stokeslets, which are the time-dependent fundamental solutions of the unsteady Stokes equations. To obtain the unknown intensities of the fundamental solutions, the source points are properly located in the time-space domain and then the initial and boundary conditions at the time-space field points are collocated. In the time-marching process, the prescribed collocation procedure is applied in a time-space box with suitable time increment, thus the solutions are advanced in time. Numerical experiments of unsteady Stokes problems in 2D and 3D peanut-shaped domains with unsteady analytical solutions are carried out and the effects of time increments and source points on the solution accuracy are studied. The time evolution of history of numerical results shows good agreement with the analytical solutions, so it demonstrates that the proposed meshless numerical method with the concept of space-time unification is a promising meshless numerical scheme to solve the unsteady Stokes equations. In the spirit of the method of fundamental solutions, the present meshless method is free from numerical integrations as well as singularities in the spatial variables. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

33748571098	The method of fundamental solutions with eigenfunction expansion method for nonhomogeneous diffusion equation	In this article we describe a numerical method to solve a nonhomogeneous diffusion equation with arbitrary geometry by combining the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), the method of particular solutions (MPS), and the eigenfunction expansion method (EEM). This forms a meshless numerical scheme of the MFS-MPS-EEM model to solve nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with time-independent source terms and boundary conditions for any time and any shape. Nonhomogeneous diffusion equation with complex domain can be separated into a Poisson equation and a homogeneous diffusion equation using this model. The Poisson equation is solved by the MFS-MPS model, in which the compactly supported radial basis functions are adopted for the MPS. On the other hand, utilizing the EEM the diffusion equation is first translated to a Helmholtz equation, which is then solved by the MFS together with the technique of the singular value decomposition (SVD). Since the present meshless method does not need mesh generation, nodal connectivity, or numerical integration, the computational effort and memory storage required are minimal as compared with other numerical schemes. Test results for two 2D diffusion problems show good comparability with the analytical solutions. The proposed algorithm is then extended to solve a problem with irregular domain and the results compare very well with solutions of a finite element scheme. Therefore, the present scheme has been proved to be very promising as a meshfree numerical method to solve nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with time-independent source terms of any time frame, and for any arbitrary geometry. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The benchmarked problems of annular plates with clamped, simply supported and free boundary conditions are studied analytically as well as numerically. Wherein the results demonstrate that all true eigenvalues are contained and no spurious eigenvalues are included. In the analytical studies, the continuous version of the MFS is utilized to obtain the eigenequation by applying the degenerate kernels and Fourier series. The proposed numerical method is free from singularities, meshes, and numerical integrations and thus can be easily utilized to solve plate vibrations free from spurious eigenvalues in multiply connected domains.

The quasi-linear Burgers' equations are converted to the linear diffusion equation by the Cole-Hopf transformation and then the Multiquadrics method, which is one of the promising meshless methods, is adopted to solve the resultant diffusion equation. Due to the features of the Multiquadrics method, the Robin boundary conditions in the resultant diffusion problem can be handled effectively. Besides, the number of unknowns in the two-dimensional problem can be reduced to one, so the computer memory and computational cost can be lessened to the minimum. One- and two-dimensional Burgers' equations are examined by the proposed meshless method and the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. Therefore, the proposed numerical method can be considered as a simple and efficient numerical tool in dealing with the problems of Burgers' equations.

37248999866	Convective drying analysis of three-dimensional porous solid by mass lumping finite element technique	A numerical analysis of convective drying of a 3D porous solid of brick material is carried out using the finite element method and mass lumping technique. The energy equation and moisture transport equations for the porous solid are derived based on continuum approach following Whitaker's theory of drying. The governing equations are solved using the Galerkin's weighted residual method, which convert the governing equations into discretized form of matrix equations. The resulting capacitance matrices are made diagonal matrices by following the classical row-sum mass lumping technique. Hence with the use of the Eulerian time marching scheme, the final equations are reduced to simple algebraic equations, which can be solved directly without using an equation solver. The proposed numerical scheme is initially validated with experimental results for 1D drying problem and then tested by application to convective drying of 3D porous solid of brick material for four different aspect ratios obtained by varying the cross section of the solid.

Through the method of fundamental solutions and the condition number analysis, it is numerically found that solutions of inverse Laplace problems can be obtained without iteration or regularization for small noise levels, since the method of fundamental solutions is a boundary-type meshless numerical method that can automatically satisfy the governing equation. However for larger values of noise levels regularization is still necessary to obtain promising result. The present paper mainly focuses on the two types of numerical predictions of inverse 2D Laplace problems: (1) Cauchy problem, and (2) shape identification problem.

59049089367	3D hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary finite-element analysis of heat and flow patterns in a two-roll mill	A fully three-dimensional time-dependent Navier-Stokes model with forced convection is developed to numerically investigate the heat and flow patterns of the two-roll mill system with two inner rotating cylinders. Such direct numerical simulations are usually limited by the difficulties from huge computational cost and complex boundary treatment. For a fast numerical process, we can use the operator-splitting scheme with the BTD term to advance the solution in temporal evolution. To implement the calculation over a Cartesian grid, the hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary finite-element method is employed for spatial discretization. In the authors' previous study [D.L. Young, C.L. Chiu, C.M. Fan, A hybrid Cartesian/immersed-boundary finite-element method for simulating heat and flow patterns in a two-roll mill, Numer. Heat Transfer B 51 (3) (2007) 251-274], we have developed a simplified 2D numerical model to analyze the heat and flow patterns on the cross section of two-roll-mill flow under the assumption of infinite length in the third (vertical) direction. However, the 2D solutions could not completely represent the realistic physical phenomena unless a 3D algorithm is developed. In this study we then paid the particular attention to develop a 3D model to investigate the vertical heat and flow behaviors, including 3D features of the vortex structure, periodic oscillation and chaotic instabilities. It is found that the proposed 3D model is able to cover the 2D features if the assumptions of 2D conditions are fulfilled. © 2009.

41649101874	FDMFS for diffusion equation with unsteady forcing function	In this paper, a novel numerical scheme called (FDMFS), which combines the finite difference method (FDM) and the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), is proposed to simulate the nonhomogeneous diffusion problem with an unsteady forcing function. Most meshless methods are confined to the investigations of nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with steady forcing functions due to the difficulty to find an unsteady particular solution. Therefore, we proposed a FDM with Cartesian grid to handle the unsteady nonhomogeneous term of the equations. The numerical solution in FDMFS is decomposed into a particular solution and a homogeneous solution. The particular solution is constructed using the FDM in an artificial regular domain which contains the real irregular domain without boundary conditions, and the homogeneous solution can be obtained by the time-space unification MFS in the irregular domain with boundary conditions. Besides, the Cartesian grid for particular solution is very simple to generate automatically. Our paper is the first time to propose an algorithm to solve nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with unsteady forcing functions using MFS to solve homogeneous solutions and FDM to calculate the particular solutions. Numerical experiments are presented for 2D problems in regular and irregular domains to show the high performance of this proposed scheme. Moreover, the stabilities of explicit and implicit FDM for particular solution are analyzed. Numerical studies suggest that the proposed FDMFS can speed up the simulation and save the CPU time and memory storage substantially. Copyright © 2008 Tech Science Press.

48049119940	The meshless method for one-dimensional hyperbolic equation	A novel numerical model is developed in this paper to solve the one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations using wave equation as an example. The proposed numerical scheme was formed by combining the Eulerian-Lagrangian method of fundamental solutions (ELMFS) and the D'Alembert solution. The ELMFS based on the diffusion fundamental solution and the Eulerian-Lagrangian method was a truly meshless and integral-free numerical method. Moreover, the D'Alembert formulation was introduced to avoid the difficulty of dealing with the Dirac delta function in the Cauchy problem. According to the D'Alembert solution, the second-order hyperbolic partial differential equation was reduced to two first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations which are solved by the ELMFS. The two opposite-direction first-order hyperbolic equations are approximated by two advection-diffusion equations with extremely small diffusion effect. The developed numerical scheme, a purely meshless method, can easily transport the solutions between the Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. Furthermore there are some numerical tests for the one-dimensional wave propagation problems. Then the problem of vibrating string in a semi-infinite domain is solved by the proposed numerical schemes. After numerical validations and sensitive tests, it is proven that the ELMFS combining with the D'Alembert solution is a promising meshless numerical solver for second-order hyperbolic partial differential equations.

58449093808	The method of fundamental solutions with eigenfunctions expansion method for 3D nonhomogeneous diffusion equations	After the successful applications of the combination of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS), the method of particular solutions (MPS), and the eigenfunctions expansion method (EEM) to solve 2D homogeneous and nonhomogeneous diffusion equations by Young et al. (Young et al., Numer Meth Part Differ Equat 22 (2006), 1173), this article intends to extend the same fundamental concepts to calculate more challenging 3D nonhomogeneous diffusion equations. The nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with time-independent source terms and boundary conditions are analyzed by the proposed meshless MFS-MPS-EEM model. Nonhomogeneous diffusion equation in any complex domains can be decomposed into a Poisson equation and a homogeneous diffusion equation by the principle of linear superposition. This approach is proved to be far better off than solutions by using classic method of separation of variables with inefficient multisummation of very sophisticated series expansion from special functions, which can only limit to treat very simple 3D geometries such as cube, cylinder, or sphere. Poisson equation is solved by using the MPS-MFS model, in which the source term in the Poisson equation is first handled by the MPS based on the compactly-supported radial basis functions and the Laplace equation is solved by the MFS. On the other hand, by utilizing the EEM, the homogeneous diffusion equation is first transformed into a Helmholtz equation, which is then solved by the MFS together with the technique of singular value decomposition (SVD) to acquire the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. After the eigenfunctions are obtained, we can synthesize the diffusion solutions like the orthogonal Fourier series expansions but with only one summation for the series even for multidimensional problems. Numerical results for four case studies of 3D homogeneous and nonhomogeneous diffusion problems show good agreement with the analytical and other numerical solutions, such as finite element method (FEM). Thus, the present numerical scheme has provided a promising meshfree numerical approach to solve 3D nonhomogeneous diffusion equations with time-independent source terms and boundary conditions for very irregular domains. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

67349131537	Numerical analysis of acoustic modes using the linear least squares method of fundamental solutions	The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) has been proved to be an accurate and efficient meshless numerical method to solve acoustic eigenproblems. Traditionally, the technique of the singular value decomposition (SVD) is employed to obtain the corresponding contours of acoustical modes after the eigenvalues are solved. However, it is found that the mode shapes are sensitive to the source locations of the MFS. In this paper, we try to derive a robust meshless numerical scheme to obtain the contours of acoustical modes based on the linear least squares method of fundamental solutions (LSMFS) by specifying an additional normalized dual boundary condition. The failure for determining the mode shapes by specifying a normalized data at boundary locations near or on the nodes are examined. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the mode shapes of degenerate eigenmodes can be distinguished by specifying the boundary data at different boundary points. Furthermore, a normalization procedure is introduced for degenerate eigenmodes. Three numerical experiments with regular and irregular boundaries are carried out to validate the proposed method. Mode shapes obtained by the linear LSMFS are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and also the results obtained by the finite element method. In addition, the robustness and accuracy of the eigenvalues obtained with respect to different locations of source points by the linear LSMFS in conjunction with direct determinant search method are also revisited. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

67349137058	The method of fundamental solutions for solving incompressible Navier-Stokes problems	A novel meshless numerical procedure based on the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is proposed to solve the primitive variables formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. The MFS is a meshless method since it is free from the mesh generation and numerical integration. We will transform the Navier-Stokes equations into simple advection-diffusion and Poisson differential operators via the operator-splitting scheme or the so-called projection method, instead of directly using the more complicated fundamental solutions (Stokeslets) of the unsteady Stokes equations. The resultant velocity advection-diffusion equations and the pressure Poisson equation are then calculated by using the MFS together with the Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) and the method of particular solutions (MPS). The proposed meshless numerical scheme is a first attempt to apply the MFS for solving the Navier-Stokes equations in the moderate-Reynolds-number flow regimes. The lid-driven cavity flows at the Reynolds numbers up to 3200 for two-dimensional (2D) and 1000 for three-dimensional (3D) are chosen to validate the present algorithm. Through further simulating the flows in the 2D circular cavity with an eccentric rotating cylinder and in the 3D cube with a fixed sphere inside, we are able to demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed meshless method in the irregular geometry and multi-dimensional flows, even though very coarse node points are used in this study as compared with other mesh-dependent numerical schemes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

69249221235	The time-marching method of fundamental solutions for wave equations	In this paper, a meshless numerical algorithm is developed for the solution of multi-dimensional wave equations with complicated domains. The proposed numerical method, which is truly meshless and quadrature-free, is based on the Houbolt finite difference (FD) scheme, the method of the particular solutions (MPS) and the method of fundamental solutions (MFS). The wave equation is transformed into a Poisson-type equation with a time-dependent loading after the time domain is discretized by the Houbolt FD scheme. The Houbolt method is used to avoid the difficult problem of dealing with time evolution and the initial conditions to form the linear algebraic system. The MPS and MFS are then coupled to analyze the governing Poisson equation at each time step. In this paper we consider six numerical examples, namely, the problem of two-dimensional membrane vibrations, the wave propagation in a two-dimensional irregular domain, the wave propagation in an L-shaped geometry and wave vibration problems in the three-dimensional irregular domain, etc. Numerical validations of the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed method have proven that the meshless numerical model is a highly accurate and efficient tool for solving multi-dimensional wave equations with irregular geometries and even with non-smooth boundaries. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We use the MFS with external source (MFS-ES) and MPS to solve a sequence of inhomogeneous problems for the determination of the eigenfrequencies. This is an alternative to the typical methods of directly solving the homogeneous matrix system to search for the eigenvalues in an eigenproblem. The square, elliptic, concentric annular and eccentric annular waveguides are analyzed to demonstrate the capability and robustness of the present meshless numerical method. In the numerical experiments, the computational results are not sensitive at all to the locations of the external source. Furthermore, the spurious eigenfrequencies will not occur in this boundary-type meshless method which is different from other numerical methods.

77449114619	The method of fundamental solutions for one-dimensionalwave equations	A meshless numerical algorithm is developed for the solutions ofone-dimensional wave equations in this paper. The proposed numerical scheme is constructed by the Eulerian-Lagrangian method of fundamental solutions (ELMFS) together with the D'Alembert formulation. The D'Alembert formulation is used to avoid the difficulty to constitute the linear algebraic system by using the ELMFS in dealing with the initial conditions and time-evolution. Moreover the ELMFS based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian method (ELM) and the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is a truly meshless and quadrature-free numerical method. In this proposed wave model, the one-dimensional wave equation is reduced to an implicit form of two advection equations by the D'Alembert formulation. Solutions of advection equations are then approximated by the ELMFS with exceptionally small diffusion effects. We will consider five numerical examples to test the capability of the wave model in finite and infinite domains. Namely, the traveling wave propagation, the time-space Cauchy problems and the problems of vibrating string, etc. Numerical validations of the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed method have demonstrated that the proposed meshless numerical model is a highly accurate and efficient scheme for solving one-dimensional wave equations.

76749123436	The meshless analog equation method for solving heat transfer to molten polymer flow in tubes	In this paper, we proposed a meshless analog equation method (MAEM) to solve a heat transfer problem of molten polymer flow, which is considered to be a generalized Newtonian viscous flow. The MAEM, free from mesh generation and numerical integration, is a powerful meshless method. The numerical solutions are expressed by a linear combination of the derived radial basis functions (RBFs). This paper considers two different viscosity models for the molten polymer; one is temperature-independent power-law model and the other is temperature-dependent power-law model. The viscous dissipation term is included in the energy equation to capture the relevant physical phenomena. From the comparisons of numerical simulation, the meshless solutions are in good agreement with some analytical solutions and other finite element solutions. Moreover, the MAEM uses much less CPU-time and computer memory to simulate molten polymer flows. Therefore, it is believed that the RBF-based meshless method of the MAEM is a promising and flexible numerical scheme for molten polymer flow simulation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

77952802835	The scalar homotopy method for solving non-linear obstacle problem	In this study, the nonlinear obstacle problems, which are also known as the nonlinear free boundary problems, are analyzed by the scalar homotopy method (SHM) and the finite difference method. The one-and two-dimensional nonlinear obstacle problems, formulated as the nonlinear complementarity problems (NCPs), are discretized by the finite difference method and form a system of nonlinear algebraic equations (NAEs) with the aid of Fischer-Burmeister NCP-function. Additionally, the system of NAEs is solved by the SHM, which is globally convergent and can get rid of calculating the inverse of Jacobian matrix. In SHM, by introducing a scalar homotopy function and a fictitious time, the NAEs are transformed to the ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be integrated numerically to obtain the solutions of NAEs. Owing to the characteristic of global convergence in SHM, the restart algorithm is adopted to fasten the convergence of numerical integration for ODEs. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and consistency of the proposed scheme. Besides, some factors, which might influence on the accuracy of the numerical results, are examined by a series of numerical experiments. © 2010 Tech Science Press.

79551571446	Modified collocation Trefftz method for the geometry boundary identification problem of heat conduction	In this article, a meshless numerical algorithm is proposed for the boundary identification problem of heat conduction, one kind of inverse problem. In the geometry boundary identification problem, the Cauchy data is given for part of the boundary. The Neumann boundary condition is given for the other portion of the boundary, whose spatial position is unknown. In order to stably solve the inverse problem, the modified collocation Trefftz method, a promising boundary-type meshless method, is adopted for discretizing this problem. Since the spatial position for part of the boundary is unknown, the numerical discretization results in a system of nonlinear algebraic equations (NAEs). Then, the exponentially convergent scalar homotopy algorithm (ECSHA) is used to efficiently obtain the convergent solution of the system of NAEs. The ECSHA is insensitive to the initial guess of the evolutionary process. In addition, the efficiency of the computation is greatly improved, since calculation of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix can be avoided. Four numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed meshless scheme. In addition, some factors that might influence the performance of the proposed scheme are examined through a series of numerical experiments. The stability of the proposed scheme can be proven by adding some noise to the boundary conditions. Copyright © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

80053571399	Numerical solutions of boundary detection problems using modified collocation Trefftz method and exponentially convergent scalar homotopy algorithm	In this paper, the boundary detection problem, which is governed by the Laplace equation, is analyzed by the modified collocation Trefftz method (MCTM) and the exponentially convergent scalar homotopy algorithm (ECSHA). In the boundary detection problem, the Cauchy data is given on part of the boundary and the Dirichlet boundary condition on the other part of the boundary, whose spatial position is unknown a priori. By adopting the MCTM, which is meshless and integral-free, the numerical solution is expressed by a linear combination of the T-complete functions of the Laplace equation. The use of a characteristic length in MCTM can stabilize the numerical procedure and ensure highly accurate solutions. Since the coefficients of MCTM and the position of part of the boundary are unknown, to collocate the boundary conditions will yield a system of nonlinear algebraic equations; the ECSHA, which is exponentially convergent, is adopted to solve the system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the ability and accuracy of the proposed meshless scheme.

81455155031	Solution of inverse boundary optimization problem by trefftz method and exponentially convergent scalar homotopy algorithm	The inverse boundary optimization problem, governed by the Helmholtz equation, is analyzed by the Trefftz method (TM) and the exponentially convergent scalar homotopy algorithm (ECSHA). In the inverse boundary optimization problem, the position for part of boundary with given boundary condition is unknown, and the position for the rest of boundary with additionally specified boundary conditions is given. Therefore, it is very difficult to handle the boundary optimization problem by any numerical scheme. In order to stably solve the boundary optimization problem, the TM, one kind of boundary-type meshless methods, is adopted in this study, since it can avoid the generation of mesh grid and numerical integration. In the boundary optimization problem governed by the Helmholtz equation, the numerical solution of TM is expressed as linear combination of the T-complete functions. When this problem is considered by TM, a system of nonlinear algebraic equations will be formed and solved by ECSHA which will converge exponentially. The evolutionary process of ECSHA can acquire the unknown coefficients in TM and the spatial position of the unknown boundary simultaneously. Some numerical examples will be provided to demonstrate the ability and accuracy of the proposed scheme. Besides, the stability of the proposed meshless method will be validated by adding some noise into the boundary conditions. Copyright © 2011 Tech Science Press.

8344243002	Time-dependent fundamental solutions for homogeneous diffusion problems	This paper describes the applications of the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) for 1-, 2- and 3-D diffusion equations. The time-dependent fundamental solutions for diffusion equations are used directly to obtain the solution as a linear combination of the fundamental solution of the diffusion operator. The proposed scheme is free from the conventionally used Laplace transform or the finite difference scheme to deal with the time derivative of the governing equation. By properly placing the field points and the source points at a given time level, the solution is advanced in time until steady state solutions are reached. Test results obtained for 1-, 2- and 3-D diffusion problems show good comparisons with the analytical solutions and some with the MFS based on the modified Helmholtz fundamental solutions, thus the demonstration present numerical scheme of MFS with the space-time unification has been demonstrated as a promising mesh-free numerical tool to solve homogeneous diffusion problem. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The position for part of the boundary with given boundary condition is unknown and the position for the rest of the boundary with overspecified Cauchy boundary conditions is given a priori.

In the inverse Cauchy problem, overspecified boundary conditions are given along part of the boundary and no boundary condition is imposed on the rest of the boundary.

84897833433	Solving inverse Stokes problems by modified collocation Trefftz method	In this paper, the two-dimensional inverse Stokes problems, governed by bi-harmonic equations, are stably solved by the modified collocation Trefftz method (MCTM). In some practical applications of the Stokes problems, part of the boundary conditions cannot be measured in advance, so the mathematical descriptions of such problems are known as the inverse Stokes problems. When numerical simulation is adopted for solutions of the inverse Stokes problems, the solutions will become extremely unstable, which means that small perturbations in the boundary conditions will result in large errors of the final results. Hence, we adopted the MCTM for stably and efficiently analyzing the inverse Stokes problems. The MCTM is one kind of boundary-type meshless methods, so the mesh generation and the numerical quadrature can be avoided. Besides, the numerical solution is expressed as a linear combination of T-complete functions modified by a characteristic length. By enforcing the satisfactions of the boundary conditions at every boundary node, a system of linear algebraic equations will be yielded. The unknown coefficients in the solution expression can be acquired by directly inverting the coefficient matrix. The numerical solutions and their derivatives can be easily obtained by linear summation.
