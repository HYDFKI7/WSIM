15944363437	Effect of the distance between electrodes on the electronic transport properties of single molecular devices	Basing on ab initio methods and the elastic scattering Green function theory, we have investigated electronic transport properties of metal-molecule-metal junctions by taking the 4-4'-dimercaptodibenzene molecule as an example. The molecular geometric structures, electronic structures, and current-voltage characteristics have been studied for varying the distance between the two electrodes. Numerical results show that the changes of the distance between electrodes give various influence on the extended molecule s geometric and electronic structures, which brings effects on the electronic transport properties of the molecular systems. The equilibrium state of the extended molecule is not the best situation for electronic transportation. The characteristics of electronic transportation can thus be improved by adjusting the distance between the two electrodes.

14844337490	Vibrational contributions to nonlinear optical properties of methanol, ethanol and propanol	Static and dynamic vibrational contributions to the linear polarizability and the first and second nonlinear hyperpolarizabilities of methanol, ethanol and propanol have been calculated. Both the pure vibrational contribution and the zero-point vibrational averaging contribution have been determined by adopting the perturbation treatment of Bishop and Kirtman at the Hartree-Fock level. The pure vibrational contribution is quite important at the static limit, while in the optical region it varies for different nonlinear optical processes. The zero-point vibrational averaging contribution is a quite large correction to the electronic nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, especially for the second hyperpolarizability at finite fundamental frequencies. Vibrational analysis shows that the swinging modes at around 300 cm

20444385139	Studies on two-photon absorption cross-sections of 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-divinyl-benzene derivatives	The one-photon and two-photon absorption properties of a series of 1,4-dimethoxy-2,5-divinyl-benzene derivatives are investigated by use of the analytic response theory at HF level. The one-photon and two-photon fluorescence spectra of E, E-2-5-Bis[4′-(N,N-di-n-butylamino) styryl]-1,4-dimenthoxybenzene are measured. The numerical results show that these molecules have strong two-photon absorption cross sections. In the visible light region, the maximal one-photon absorption strengths of the molecules occur in the first excited state. Furthermore, the maximal two-photon absorption cross sections of the D-π-A typed molecules still appear in the first state, but for D-π-D typed molecules the second excited state has the maximal two-photon absorption cross-section. The optical properties of the molecules are closely related to the electric property of the donor and acceptor. The symmetrically substituted molecules can not be determined to have a larger two-photon absorption cross section than the asymmetrically substituted molecules for such a kind of π-center. The charge-transfer process for the charge-transfer states is displayed, and then the mechanism of photopolymerization is discussed qualitatively.

19044385426	Dynamical behavior of ultrashort pulse laser in para-nitroaniline molecules	The electronic structures and dipole moments of para-nitroaniline molecule are calculated by use of density functional theory at ab initio level. We then investigate theoretically the interaction between the ultrashort pulse laser and the para-nitroaniline molecule medium by solving the full Maxwell-Bloch equations. The effects of permanent dipole moments on the pulse reshaping, the spectrum components, and the evolutions of energy state populations are discussed in detail. The results show that the standing slowly varying envelope and the rotating-wave approximations fail to give a good description for the propagation of an ultrashort pulse in the molecule medium. Furthermore, the dipole moments of the molecule make the propagation deviate from the area theorem further and make the pulse split more quickly. When the pulse with the excitation energy of the charge-transfer state propagates in the para-nitroaniline molecule medium, the second-harmonic spectral component appears obviously and becomes stronger as the propagating distance increases, which displays the high two-photon absorption properties of the molecule.

One-photon fluorescence, one-photon fluorescence quantum yields, one-photon fluorescence lifetimes, and two-photon fluorescence have been investigated. The results show that they are all good two-photon absorbing chromophores and effective two-photon photopolymerization initiators. The two-photon absorption cross-sections of these molecules have been evaluated by theoretical calculations.

24144453367	Influence of external voltage on electronic transport properties of molecular junctions: The nonlinear transport behaviour	The influence of external voltage on the charge transport properties of benzene-1,4-dithiolate molecular junction has been investigated. Variations of the geometric and electronic structures for the molecule caused by the applied voltage are calculated at ab initio level. Based on the numerical results, we find that the energy shift and expansion coefficients in the end-site of the molecule for the frontier molecular orbitals show nearly linear dependence on voltage in the interested voltage interval. The charge transport properties of the molecular junction are then studied by employing the elastic scattering Green's function method. It is shown that the voltage has an obvious effect on the I - V characteristic of the molecular junction, particularly the shape of the conductance curves. The I - V curves are consistent with the experimental measurement quite well. © 2005 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The electronic structures and parameters for the compound have been calculated by using density functional theory. In the optical regime, there is one charge-transfer state, and the molecule can thus be simplified as a two-level system. Both the one- and two-photon transitions occur between the ground and charge-transfer states. The numerical results show that the permanent dipole moments have an obvious effect on the propagation of the ultrashort pulse laser. The ideal self-induced transparency disappears for 2π pulse, and second harmonic spectral components occur significantly due to the two-photon absorption process. For the 6π pulse, continuum frequency generation is produced and a shorter duration pulse in time domain with 465 as is obtained. © 2005 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

There exist two charge-transfer states for the compound in visible region. The two-photon absorption cross section calculated by a three-state model and solvatochromic shift of the charge-transfer states are found to be solvent-dependent, where a nonmonotonic behaviour with respect to the polarity of the solvents is observed. The numerical results show that the organic molecule exhibits a rather large two-photon absorption cross section as compared with the compound 4-trans-[p-(N, N-Di-n-butylamino)-p-stilbenyl vinyl] pyridine (DBASVP) reported previously and is predicted to be a good two-photon polymerization initiator.

28344449188	Dipolar effects on propagation of ultrashort laser pulse in one-dimensional para-nitroaniline (pNA) molecules	The dynamic behaviour of ultrashort (femtosecond) laser pulses in a molecular medium is studied by solving the full Maxwell-Bloch equations beyond the limits of the slowly varying envelope approximation and the rotating-wave approximation under the resonant and the non-resonant conditions. A one-dimensional asymmetric charge-transfer molecule, para-nitroaniline, is used as a model molecule whose electronic properties are calculated with the time-dependent hybrid density functional theory. Under the one-photon resonant condition, 4π pulse is separated into two sub-pulses. The weight of the second-harmonic component mainly contributed by the two-photon excitation becomes stronger with longer propagation time. Under the two-photon resonant condition, the separation of 4π pulse is not induced and many higher-order spectral components beyond the second-harmonic generation occur. Interestingly, when the pulse propagates for long enough, the carrier modification becomes so significant that a continuous spectrum is generated. The Fourier transform of the high-harmonic spectrum demonstrates that an even shorter laser pulse can be produced in both resonant and non-resonant propagations. The effects of permanent dipole moments on the pulse evolution are discussed. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.

27744587300	Solvent effects on the vibronic one-photon absorption profiles of dioxaborine heterocycles	The vibronic profiles of one-photon absorption spectra of dioxaborine heterocycles in gas phase and solution have been calculated at the Hartree-Fock and density-functional-theory levels. The polarizable continuum model has been applied to simulate the solvent effect, while the linear coupling model is used to compute the Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller contributions. It is found that a good agreement between theory and experiment can be achieved when the solvent effect and electron correlation are taken into account simultaneously. For the first excited charge-transfer state, the maximum of its Herzberg-Teller profile is blueshifted from that of the Franck-Condon profile. The shifted energy is found to be around 0.2 eV, which agrees well with the measured energy difference between two- and one-photon absorptions of the first excited state. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

30744441600	Theoretical study of one-, two-, and three-photon absorption properties for a series of Y-shaped molecules	In this paper, the equilibrium geometries, one-, two-, and three-photon absorption properties, and the transition nature of a series of Y-shaped molecules which possess an imidazole-thiazole core have been theoretically studied by using the parametrization model 3 and Zerner's intermediate neglect of differential overlap methods. Our calculated results have confirmed the experimental findings that the investigated molecules are all promising multiphoton absorption materials and both the two-photon absorption and the three-photon absorption cross sections are seriatim increscent along with the increase of the electron-donor strength. The nonlinear optical phenomenon originates from the intramolecular charge transfer within the π -conjugated system. The calculated results indicate that the heterocyclic core increases the two- and three-photon absorption cross sections due to its π -excessive nature. So it can provide more free electrons to enlarge the charge transfer within the molecule system. In addition, the design of Y shape and the sulfonyl-based electron-accepting group play a part in the enhancement of multiphoton absorption. It is notable that molecules with heterocyclic core will provide favorable condition for multiphoton absorption applications. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33644531908	Electronic transport properties of molecular bipyridine junctions: Effects of isomer and contact structures	The effects of contact structures and isomers on the current-voltage characteristics of molecular bipyridine junctions have been investigated by means of a generalized quantum chemical approach based on the elastic scattering Green's function method. For the four isomers 4, 4′ -bipyridine, 2, 2′ -bipyridine, 2, 4′ -bipyridine, and 2, 6′ -bipyridine under investigation, the 2, 4′ -bipyridine junction is found to be the poorest conductor owing to its nonsymmetrical arrangement. Numerical simulations of the 4, 4′ -bipyridine junction show that the contact structures between molecule and metallic electrodes have a noticeable effect on the electron transport characteristics of molecular junctions. The shortening of the distance between two metallic electrodes results in a stronger coupling and lower potential barrier between them, leading to larger conductance. The external electric fields cause the charge redistribution within molecule and lead to the presence of resistivity dipoles at the molecule-metal interface, and the bias voltages are mainly dropped there. The nonlinear charge transport effect on the current and conductance of 4, 4′ -bipyridine molecular junctions at the lower-bias region is presented.

The generalized few-state model is employed to calculate two-photon absorption cross sections of the compounds. It is found that boron-based A-π-A compounds have large two-photon absorption cross sections. Moreover, the length of π center has larger effect on the one- and two-photon absorption properties of boron-based A-π-A compounds than those of nitrogen-based D-π-D compounds. The numerical simulation shows that boron-based A-π-A compounds have similar performance as nitrogen-based D-π-D analogues in regard to nonlinear optical properties. Boron-based A-π-A compounds are promising candidates for large two-photon absorption materials.

33646351058	Dynamical behavior of ultra-short laser pulse in a cascade three-level molecular system	We study the interaction between the ultra-short laser pulses and the one-dimensional symmetrical TC conjugated molecular material (4,4'-bis (dimethylamino) stilbene) by solving Maxwell-Bloch equations. This kind of molecular material has strong nonlinear optical properties, and its electronic structures and dipole moments are calculated by use of density functional theory on ab initio level. The numerical results show that the slowly varying envelope approximation and the rotating wave approximation cannot accurately describe the propagation properties of the ultra-short pulse in the molecular medium. In the case of single photon resonance, the two-level model can well describe the interaction between the small area pulse and the molecular system. For large area pulse, due to the existence of strongly secondary excitation to the higher-lying levels, the three-level model should be used. When the amplitude of the incident electric field is kept constant, the third level's population increases with the increase of the pulse area.

The numerical results show that pyridazine-2, 5-dithiol has higher current and conductance, while the conductance of pyrimidine-2, 5-dithiol is very small when the bias voltage is lower than 4V. The conductivity of the molecule pyridine with selenium atom as the terminal atom is higher than that with oxygen atom or sulfur atom.

The super-molecular structures of the solute and the solvent molecules connected by hydrogen bonding have been constructed for four kinds of polar solvents. The long range interaction simulated by polarizable continuum model, the hydrogen bonding interaction, and the whole interaction between the solute and the medium were separately investigated. The numerical results show that the hydrogen bonding interaction may induce a large variation of the structures and properties of 4-nitro-buta-1,3-dienylamine molecule. As a result, the hydrogen bonding interaction should be considered when one intends to simulate the solvent effects accurately.

33751214828	First-principle studies of I-V properties of a molecular wire	The elastic scattering Green function method has been developed to describe the I-V characteristics of molecular wires. The molecular electronic structure and the interaction between the molecule and the gold surface are two key factors for the charge transport properties of molecular wires in the formulas. An ab initio calculation at the hybrid density functional theory level is carried out to obtain the electronic structure of 4-4′-dimercaptodibenzene molecule. The frontier orbit theory and the perturbation theory are employed to determine the constant of the interaction energy between molecule and surface quantitatively. The numerical results show that the bonding between the sulfur atom and the gold atoms corresponds mainly to the covalent bond. Some molecular orbits are extended over molecule and gold cluster that certainly give channels for the charge transport, other molecular orbits are localized and the charge transport can take place by tunnel mechanism. At zero bias region, there exists a current gap. With the increasing bias, the conductance of the wire takes a shape of plateaus.

34247138000	Modulation of supercontinuum generation and formation of an attosecond pulse from a generalized two-level medium	The propagation of ultrashort pulses in a generalized two-level system, consisting of permanent dipole moments, is simulated by solving the full Maxwell-Bloch equations. Special attention has been paid to the supercontinuum generation of spectra and the formation of attosecond (as) pulses. It is found that the supercontinuum generation is strongly modulated by both area and width of the pulse, resulting from the interference between the splitting pulses in the time domain and the implication of the time-energy uncertainty relation. The effect of the permanent dipole moment on the supercontinuum generation is discussed in detail. Calculations show that a well-shaped 132 as pulse can be generated from a 2 fs incoming pulse under the condition where the permanent dipole moment difference between two levels is equal to the transition dipole moment between them. Influences of carrier-envelope phase and time-dependent ionization on the spectral and temporal evolution of the ultrashort pulses are also discussed at length. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The numerical results show that there exist charge-accumulation and charge-depletion regions located at respective inside and outside of interfaces. The variation of potential distribution is obvious at interfaces. When distance between electrodes is changed, the charge transfer and variation of potential distribution clearly have distance-dependent performance.

It is shown that the torsion angle between two phenyls is slightly decreased as increase of the external voltage while the whole molecule moves slightly along the reversed direction of the electric field. Calculations indicate that the inclusion of molecular geometry relaxation can avoid a false prediction of negative differential resistance behavior.

0033411923	Spin-related electronic structure of quantum wires with an in-plane magnetic field	Self-consistent calculation of the electronic structure of quantum wires are implemented with an in-plane magnetic field parallel to the wire and spin-density-functional theory of Kohn and Sham is applied [Phys. Rev. A 140 (1965) 1133]. The self-consistent results show that full spontaneous spin polarization takes place in low electron density regime, even at an arbitrary small magnetic field, which demonstrates that the polarization is caused by exchange interactions. The results are consistent with recent measurements of a conductance anomaly in a quantum point contact. Moreover, it is remarkable that a large splitting of spin-related subbands occurs repeatedly whenever the Fermi energy passes the subband threshold energies, although the amplitude of the splitting becomes weaker as more subbands are occupied due to the screen effect. Self-consistent results indicate that a moderate magnetic field tends to suppress the spin polarization caused by the exchange interaction. The diamagnetic shift of the subbands is determined only for those which are close to the Fermi energy.

The optimized geometrical structure shows that the two single-conjugated-segment parts in molecule BSBAB retain their own coplanarity and are nearly perpendicular to each other, which seems to indicate that the molecule BSBAB contains optical characteristics of both parts. The molecule BSBAB is found to have three two-photon absorption peaks in lowest energy region which are contributed respectively the two single-conjugated-segment parts respectively and the coupling between them. This also demonstrates that the molecule BSBAB is a broadband strong two-photon absorption chromophore.

It is shown that the dielectric medium has a rather small effect both on the bond length alternation and on the one-photon absorption spectrum, but it affects significantly the two-photon absorption cross section. It is found that both one- and two-photon absorptions are extremely sensitive to the planarity of the molecule, and the absorption intensity can be dramatically reduced by the conformation distortion. It has led to the conclusion that the experimentally observed anomalous solvent effect on the two-photon absorption of dialkylamino substituted distyrylbenzene chromophores cannot be attributed to the intrinsic properties of a single molecule and its interaction with solvents. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

Linear and non-linear optical properties of S1, S2 and S3 were investigated both experimentally and theoretically. The optical properties indicate that they all have obvious characteristics of asymmetrical dipole molecules. The measured maximum two-photon cross-sections of S1-3 are 79, 57 and 19GM (Goeppert-Mayer), respectively. It shows that the different substituents on the sulfur atom in molecules S1-3 lead to different electronic structures, which affect the optical properties. In these structures, the aromatic benzyl substituent (in S1) is superior for optimizing two-photon activity in the designed molecular framework. © 2011 CSIRO.

84897908312	Study on force sencitivity of electronic transport properties of 1, 4-butanedithiol molecular device	Based on the hybrid density functional theory, the relationship between geometric structure of 1, 4-butanedithiol molecular junction and the electrodes force and the breaking process of the molecular junction are studied. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction under different external forces are further investigated using the elastic scattering Green's function method. The numerical results show that different interface configurations result in different rupture forces. The rupture force is about 1.75 nN when the terminal S atom is sited at the hollow position of Au(111) surface. However, the rupture force is about 1.0 nN when the terminal S atom links with one Au atom which is on the gold surface singly. And with the breakdown of the molecular junction, the single Au atom is pulled away from the gold surface by the terminal S atom. These two results are consistent with different experimental measurements respectively. The molecule is twisted under the electrode pressure and thus further induces the surface Au atom to glide on the gold surface. However, the processes of the molecule twisted by pressure and restored by pulling are two irreversible processes. The stretching force of electrode is 0.7-0.8 nN, and the conductance always shows a minimal value under different interface configurations and twisting states, which is consistent with experimental conclusion. The change of the coupling between the terminal atom and the electrodes induced by the electrode force is the main factor of influencing the conductance of the molecular system. The existence of bimolecular junction results in a small possibility of higher conductance values, which is probed by experiment under a stretching force of about 0.8 nN. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

41849148285	Simulation of inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy on different contact structures in 4,4′-biphenyldithiol molecular junctions	A first-principles computational method is developed to study the inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) of 4,4′-biphenyldithiol molecular junction with three different contact structures between the molecule and electrodes in the nonresonant regime. The obtained distinct IETS can be used to resolve the geometrical structure of the molecular junction. The computational results demonstrate that the IETS has certain selection rule for vibrational modes, where the longitudinal modes with the same direction as the tunnelling current have greatest contribution to the IETS.

42549157700	Coherent control of population and pulse propagation beyond the rotating wave approximation	The dynamics of populations of the vibrational states in a NO molecule (one-photon absorption) and of the electronic states in a 4,4′- bis(dimethylamino) stilbene molecule (two-photon absorption) is studied versus the frequency, intensity and shape of the laser pulse. We show that specially designed infrared laser pulses can build selective populations of certain vibrational states. A detuning of light frequency from the vibrational resonance qualitatively changes the dynamics of populations. It is found out that the populations of the nonresonant levels follow the pulse shape adiabatically if the detuning significantly exceeds the inverse characteristic time of the change of the pulse. Depopulation of the nonresonant vibrational states leads to a high population of the resonant state at the end of the pulse. Complete breakdown of the standard rotating wave approximation for a two-photon absorption process is observed even for a rather small intensity of the laser pulse. An analytical solution for the interaction of a pulse with a three-level system beyond the rotating wave approximation is obtained, and it is in close agreement with the strict numerical solution of the amplitude equations. Special attention is paid to the population dynamics of randomly oriented molecules. The orientational disorder as well as the vibrations limit the coherent population transfer. Calculations show the strong role of the anisotropy of photoexcitation in the coherent control of populations which can affect the anisotropy of photobleaching. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.

4544237060	Influence of symmetries of the substituted donor and acceptor on two-photon absorption cross sections of trans-stilbene derivatives	We have designed a series of trans-stilbene derivatives with different arrangement of the substituents and studied their one-photon and two-photon absorption properties by using the response theory methods at HF level. The calculations show that these molecules have strong two-photon absorption cross sections. In the visible light region, the maximum two-photon absorption cross section for molecules with asymmentric substitution of the donor and acceptor occurs in the first excited state, while for the symmetric substitution cases it occurs in the fourth excited state. The asymmetry-substituted molecules have a larger two-photon absorption cross section than the symmetry substituted molecules, indicating that the effect of the different kinds of substituents on the two-photon absorption of molecules is related to the property of their π-centers. The charge-transfer process for the charge-transfer states was visualized in order to understand their maximal two-photon absorption cross sections.

52949129816	Ab initio study of one-photon and two-photon absorption properties of 2,5-bis[4-(2-arylvinyl)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazoles	The one- and two-photon absorption properties of 2,5-bis[4-(2-arylvinyl)phenyl]-1,3,4-oxadiazoles are investigated using response theory at DFT level. It is found that both one- and two-photon absorption properties are extremely sensitive to the geometry of the molecules, and the two-photon absorption cross section is dramatically reduced by the geometrical conformation distortion. The HF geometry is shown to be more realistic. The π enters in the compounds play different roles closely related with their different optical performances. The strongest two-photon performances for the compounds are predicted at suitable excited wavelengths. The maximum one-photon absorption is found to be non-monotonously dependent on the electron-donating ability of the terminal groups. © 2008.

52949147773	The theoretical simulation for two-photon absorption properties of novel A-π-D-π-A two-photon carbazole compounds	The optical properties of three newly synthesized A-π-D-π-A compounds have been studied by use of analytical response theory at the density functional theory level. The theoretical results show that there exist three charge-transfer states for each compound in the low energy regime. The trends for both oscillator strengths and excitation energies among the three compounds as predicted by the numerical simulations are highly consistent with those given by measurement. Large two-photon absorption cross sections are predicted for the three compounds. Furthermore, the solvent effect on the optical properties of the compounds is investigated. It is found that the excitation energies in solvent DMF show a red-shift compared to those in gas case, and the two-photon absorption cross sections are highly enhanced. The optical properties of the compounds with experimental geometric parameters are also investigated. The oscillator strengths are found to be smaller due to the bent molecular structures. The calculated results predict that much higher two-photon absorption cross sections would be observed when a laser with a shorter wavelength is applied. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

62649152347	Dynamics of cooperative emissions in a cascade three-level molecular system driven by an ultrashort laser pulse	This paper investigates the dynamics of cooperative emissions in a cascade three-level system driven by an ultrashort laser pulse by solving numerically the full-wave Maxwell-Bloch equations. The 4, 4′-bis(dimethylamino) stilbene molecule is used as the model molecule because of its strong two-photon absorption property. The two-colour cooperative emissions are studied as functions of molecular number density and dephasing rate of the dipole coherence. The propagation effects on the evolution of the cooperative radiations are also taken into account. The cooperative radiations are enhanced for large number density of the molecule, while the fast dephasing of the dipole coherence reduces the intensity of the cooperative radiations and delays the emission times or even inhibits the formation of the emissions. The delay time of the radiation decreases with the increase of the molecular number density and the propagation distance. © 2008 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

67649124374	Facile synthesis and systematic investigations of a series of novel bent-shaped two-photon absorption chromophores based on pyrimidine	The synthesis, structure, and single- and two-photon spectroscopic properties of a series of pyrimidinebased (bent-shaped) molecules are reported. All these stable heterocyclic compounds are fully characterized, and exhibit intense single- and two-photon excited fluorescence (SPEF and TPEF) over a wide spectral range from blue to red, with the spectral peak position of the SPEF being basically the same as that of the TPEF. The well-conjugated p-systems, observed from the crystalstructure, indicate the charge transfer feature of the ground state. Meanwhile, the theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the charge transfer from donor to acceptor is greatly enhanced in the excited states and the different substituted donor groups on the pyrimidine have a large effect on the optical and electrochemical properties. Based on typical structure data and comprehensive spectral data, the following structure-property relationships can be determined: for such bentshaped chromophores, the absorption and the fluorescence wavelength maximum of the SPEF and TPEF, and twophoton absorption cross sections show a similar trend with increasing electron- donating strength of the corresponding terminal group and the number of branches, while the average bond lengths of the p-linkage and HOMO-LUMO energy levels show an inverse trend. Experimental data and theoretical calculation provide a coherent picture. With these findings, bentshaped quadrupolar chromophores combining peak TPA cross sections (up to 2280 GM), broad TPA bands throughout the whole 700-900 nm range, and high fluorescence quantum yields could, thus, be obtained. Such compounds are of particular interest for TPEF microscopy, as well as optical data storage in the visible and NIR regions.

67649560116	Effect of time-dependent ionization on dynamical two-photon absorption cross sections of molecular media	The effect of time-dependent ionization on two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section of 4, 4′-bis(dimethylamino) stilbene molecules is studied, through solving, the Maxwell-Bloch equations using an iterative predictor-corrector and finite-difference time-domain technique. The numerical results show that for a few-cycle femtosecond pulse, the one-step resonant TPA is dominating. The two-photon saturation absorption can be observed. The dynamical TPA cross section is a linearly decreasing function of the input pulse intensity when the input intensity is lower than TPA saturation intensity. TPA cross-section of the medium reduces as the value of photoionization cross section increases at the same propagation distance. The propagation distance has an obvious influence on the TPA cross section. The thickness of the molecular samples thus should be taken into account as measuring the TPA cross section. When the femtosecond pulse is applied to measuring the TPA cross section, conditions for the available analytic expressions are discussed.

67649783613	Effect of time-dependent ionization on properties of the ultrashort pulse propagation and optical power limiting in a two-photon absorption molecular medium	By taking the strong two-photon absorption 4, 4'-bis (dimethylamino) stilbene molecules as medium, the propagation of femosecond laser pulses in this medium is simulated by numerically solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations using an iterative predictor-corrector and finite-difference time-domain method. The influences of time-dependent ionization on two-photon absorption and optical power limiting behavior are emphatically investigated. The numerical results show that the nonlinear interactions between the pulses and the medium and the corresponding spontaneous emission become weaker when the time-dependent photoionization is considered. The effects of photonionization on the main pulse become more evident as the amplitude of input electric field is increased. When the photonionization cross section is larger, the dynamic optical limiting range becomes broader, which demonstrates that the limited photonionization ability is favorable for the optical power limiting. Furthermore, the propagating-distance dependence of the dynamical behavior of the ultrashort laser pulse in the medium is observed.

69749088526	Two-photon area evolution and optical limiting of ultrashort laser pulses in DBASVP molecule media	Taking the one-dimensional asymmetrical π conjugation molecule material (DBASVP molecules) as medium, with the two-photon resonance, we studied the propagation of ultrashort laser pulses in the medium based on the two-photon area theorem and the numerical solutions of the coupled Bloch and Maxwell's equations. The evolution of two-photon area is thus investigated and the applicability of the two-photon area is then discussed. A theoretical method for simulating the optical limiting properties of molecular medium is pointed out. The molecular electronic structures and dipole moments are calculated by use of density functional theory at ab initio level. The numerical results show that the two-photon area theorem based on the slowly varying envelope and phase approximations cannot accurately describe the evolution of the two-photon area in the molecular medium. The optical limiting behavior based on the two-photon absorption is related to the width of the molecular medium. © 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc.

Results show that both compounds have large one-photon and two-photon absorption abilities. In the low energy region, the maximum one-photon absorption strength of NT-G1 is twice as much as that of SK-G1 and its maximum absorption is red shifted compared to that for SK-G1. The maximum two-photon absorption cross section of NT-G1 is about five times as large as that of SK-G1 and those are found for the second excited states. Furthermore, NT-G1 has a wider two-photon absorption energy band. The optical properties of the molecules are closely related to their charge transfer processes when they are excited.

74949113283	Propagation of a strong x-ray pulse: Pulse compression, stimulated Raman scattering, amplified spontaneous emission, lasing without inversion, and four-wave mixing	We study the compression of strong x-ray pulses from x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) propagating through the resonant medium of atomic argon. The simulations are based on the three-level model with the frequency of the incident x-ray pulse tuned in the 2p3/2-4s resonance. The pulse propagation is accompanied by the self-seeded stimulated resonant Raman scattering (SRRS). The SRRS starts from two channels of amplified spontaneous emission (ASE), 4s-2p3/2 and 3s-2p3/2, which form the extensive ringing pattern and widen the power spectrum. The produced seed field triggers the Stokes ASE channel 3s-2p3/2. The population inversion is quenched for longer propagation distances where the ASE is followed by the lasing without inversion (LWI), which amplifies the Stokes component. Both ASE and LWI reshape the input pulse: The compressed front part of the pulse (up to 100 as) is followed by the long tail of the ringing and beating between the pump and Stokes frequencies. The pump pulse also generates weaker Stokes and anti-Stokes fields caused by four-wave mixing. These four spectral bands have fine structures caused by the dynamical Stark effect. A slowdown of the XFEL pulse up to 78% of the speed of light in vacuum is found because of a large nonlinear refractive index. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

Simulation results show that the original single propagation mode becomes two modes when the cavities within the waveguide are rotated alternately, and the group velocities of the modes is reduced greatly. When the rotated angle of the selected cavities is 45°, the group velocities of the propagating modes can be reduced by one order of magnitude. Compared with that of the coupled-resonator optical waveguide without rotation of selected cavities, the two velocities get their minimum value, which are 0.0016c and 0.0009c respectively.

Hybrid density functional theory is used to calculate the electronic structures and the static TPA properties of the compound. Ab initio calculations show that this molecular system should be described by a three-level model in the visible light regime. Special attention has been paid to its optical limiting behaviour and dynamical TPA cross section. Our numerical results show that the BDPAS molecular medium exhibits a strong optical limiting behaviour. For rather short pulses, the dynamical TPA cross section is almost a linearly increasing function of the pulse width. For longer pulses, the dynamical TPA cross section is largely enhanced because of the two-step TPA. The performance of optical limiting strongly depends on the pulse width, the thickness and the concentration of the absorber. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.

78649588474	Rotational Doppler effect in x-ray photoionization	The energy of the photoelectron experiences a red or blue Doppler shift when the molecule recedes from the detector or approaches him. This results in a broadening of the photoelectron line due to the translational thermal motion. However, the molecules also have rotational degrees of freedom and we show that the translational Doppler effect has its rotational counterpart. This rotational Doppler effect leads to an additional broadening of the spectral line of the same magnitude as the Doppler broadening caused by translational thermal motion. The rotational Doppler broadening as well as the rotational recoil broadening is sensitive to the molecular orbital from which the photoelectron is ejected. This broadening should be taken into account in analysis of x-ray photoemission spectra of super-high resolution and it can be directly observed using x-ray pump-probe spectroscopy. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

However the effect of the length of the chain linked to the π-centre on the optical property is very little. For the investigated compounds, the A-π-A type charge-transfer molecules display more superior one- and two-photon absorption characteristics than the D-π-D type ones. Furthermore, the two-photon absorption results by use of few-state model are generally consistent with those by analytic response theory, demonstrating the reliability of the few-state model for evaluating the two-photon absorption cross section.

78649378971	Two-photon absorption properties of aggregation systems on the basis of (E)-4-(2-nitrovinyl) benzenamine molecules	Aggregation effect caused by the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions on two-photon absorption properties of (E)-4-(2-nitrovinyl) benzenamine molecules is studied at a hybrid density functional level. The geometry optimization studies indicate that there exist two probable conformations for the dimers and three for the trimers. A strong red-shift of the charge-transfer states is shown. The two-photon absorption cross sections of the molecule for certain conformations are greatly enhanced by the aggregation effect, from which a ratio of 1.0:2.6:3.6 is found for the molecule and its dimer and trimer with nearly planar structures. Namely, a 30 or 20 percent increase of the two-photon absorption cross section is observed. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

78650962134	Two-photon-induced x-ray emission in neon atoms	We investigated the resonant x-ray emission from a neon atom induced by the two-photon population of a double-core-hole excited state. Two qualitatively different schemes of this process are studied: The first one involves an off-resonant intermediate single-core-hole state; the second scheme passes through a resonant core-ionized intermediate state. The numerical simulations of the resonant x-ray emission performed for different peak intensities and pulse durations show significant population of the double-core-hole final states. Therefore, rather strong two-photon absorption-induced x-ray emission is predicted for both studied schemes. Thus, high counting rates in experimental measurements are expected. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

The theoretical results show that there are a few charge-transfer states for each compound in the lower energy region. The one-photon absorption properties of the five investigated compounds are highly consistent with those given by experimental measurements. The two-photon absorption intensities of the compounds are greatly enhanced with the increments of the molecular sizes, in which the two-photon absorption cross section of the four-branched compound is about 5.6 times of that of the mono-branched molecule. Furthermore, it is shown that the two-photon absorption properties are sensitive to the geometrical arrangements. © 2010 Chinese Physical Society.

79551699275	Solvent effect on dynamical TPA and optical limiting of BDMAS molecular media for nanosecond and femtosecond laser pulses	The dynamical two-photon absorption (TPA) cross section as well as optical limiting of a 4,4′-bis(dimethylamino) stilbene (BDMAS) molecular medium for the nanosecond and femtosecond laser pulses is studied. This molecular medium can be described by a cascade three-level model in the visible light regime. Our numerical results show that the BDMAS molecular medium exhibits a strong optical limiting behaviour. The saturation TPA in the femtosecond time domain can be observed, and materials with larger nonlinear absorption cross sections would be much easier to saturate. Due to the contribution of the two-step TPA, the dynamical TPA cross section of BDMAS for nanosecond pulses is about three orders of magnitude larger than that for ultrashort femtosecond pulses. Special attention has been paid to the solvent effects on the optimal limiting performance. With an enhancement of the polarity of solvents, the dynamical optical limiting window becomes broader. In the origin of optical limiting, the dynamical TPA cross section of BDMAS decreases when the polarity of solvents increases, which is in good agreement with the experiment. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

79952931567	Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy of gold-benzenedithiol-gold junctions: Accurate determination of molecular conformation	The gold-benzenedithiol-gold junction is the classic prototype of molecular electronics. However, even with the similar experimental setup, it has been difficult to reproduce the measured results because of the lack of basic information about the molecular confirmation inside the junction. We have performed systematic first principles study on the inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy of this classic junction. By comparing the calculated spectra with four different experimental results, the most possible conformations of the molecule under different experimental conditions have been successfully determined. The relationship between the contact configuration and the resulted spectra is revealed. It demonstrates again that one should always combine the theoretical and experimental inelastic electron tunneling spectra to determine the molecular conformation in a junction. Our simulations have also suggested that in terms of the reproducibility and stability, the electromigrated nanogap technique is much better than the mechanically controllable break junction technique. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The effect of the LFC is considerably obvious when pulses with large areas propagate in the dense molecular medium. In the case of resonance, the group velocity of the sub-pulses split from the incident pulse along propagation is severely decreased by the LFC, especially for the latest sub-pulse. However, in the case of nonresonance, the influence of the LFC on the temporal evolution of the pulse is less obvious and lacks homogeneity with an increase in incident pulse area, propagation distance and molecular density. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results show a weak or missing correlation between the molecular length and the two-photon absorption intensity. An analysis of the effects of electronic, vibronic and solvent contributions on the TPA cross sections was made. Results revealed a moderate solvent effect on TPA; and large effects of vibronic coupling on the TPA cross sections for multibranched molecules. However, the vibronic coupling effects were small for one-dimensional conjugated systems.

The conductance characteristics are quite different for the two isomers which can be used to construct molecular switch. Our study shows that the molecules are chemically adsorbed on the gold surface by the terminal carboxyl group. Each molecular junction has three different stable conductances, which correspond to the different contact structures between the molecules and electrodes. The different conductances result mainly from the variation of the electronic structures, caused by the interaction between the molecules and the electrodes. Our theoretical simulation is consistent with the experimental measurement. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society.

79961230762	First-principles study on formation and electron-transport properties of single oligothiophene molecular junctions	In this work, the formation of single oligothiophene molecular junctions was studied using density functional theory. The elastic scattering Green's function method was applied to investigate the electron-transport properties of the molecular junctions and their conductance switching properties caused by an electrochemical gate. Given four configurations, the optimized structures and breakdown forces of the molecular junctions were obtained. The breakdown of the oligothiophene molecular junctions is likely to occur at the Au-S bond as the electrodes are pulled. The simulated results show that the experimental findings that the four-repeating-unit oligothiophene is more conductive than the three-repeating-unit oligothiophene are due to their different configurations. The oligothiophenes' electronic structures are sensitive to the gate field, and their conductance switching properties are explained when a gate field is applied. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

It shows that conductive ability of molecular membranes increased 2 to 3 orders of magnitude than that of a single molecule due to interaction between molecules. Conductive ability of a molecular junction increases with increasing external force. Increase of current is mainly due to increased probability of tunneling within and between chains in a molecular junction. The increased probability is caused by coupling enhancement between molecule and electrode and between molecules.

It is demonstrated that the dominated mechanism may be converted between the two mechanisms by changing the molecular length, which induces an inversion of the rectification.

80054769181	Assignments of inelastic electron tunneling spectra of semifluorinated alkanethiol molecular junctions	The peculiar experimental inelastic electron tunneling spectra of a series of hexadecanethiol molecular junctions have finally been reproduced by first-principles simulations. It is found that the debated spectral profile around 0.38 eV indeed originated from the C-H stretching vibration associated with at least two terminal methylene groups close to the sulfur atom. The intensity of this spectral peak becomes dominant, as observed in the experiments when the molecule is titled -40° relative to the normal of the electrode surface, which is due to the opening of a new tunneling pathway bypassing the end sulfur atom. The dependence of this strong vibrational feature on the titled angle of the molecule is predicted with the help of the concept of effective coupling energy. The degree of the fluorination on the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum of hexadecanethiol molecules has also been discussed in detail. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The results indicate that the studied complexes present more symmetric geometry structures than the ligand. The charge-transfer states of the two complexes in the lower energy region are all almost degenerate but those of the ligand are well separated. The ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of the ligand, zinc-porphyrin and magnesium-porphyrin complexes is 1.0:1.5:1.8, demonstrating that the two-photon absorption capability can be greatly increased when the ligand is coordinated with a metal ion. Moreover, several physical micro-mechanisms including electron transitions and intramolecular charge-transfer processes are discussed to explore the differences in optical property between the ligand and two complexes. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84055191079	The effects of contact configurations on the rectification of dipyrimidinyl - Diphenyl diblock molecular junctions	The transport properties of a conjugated dipyrimidinyl - diphenyl diblock oligomer sandwiched between two gold electrodes, as recently reported by [Díez-Pérez et al. Nature Chem. 1 635 (2009)], are theoretically investigated using the fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. Two kinds of symmetrical anchoring geometries are considered. Calculated current - voltage curves show that the contact structure has a strong effect on the rectification behaviour of the molecular diode. For the equilateral triangle configuration, pronounced rectification behaviour comparable to the experimental measurement is revealed, and the theoretical analysis indicates that the observed rectification characteristic results from the asymmetric shift of the perturbed molecular energy levels under bias voltage. While for the tetrahedron configuration, both rectification and negative differential conductivity behaviours are observed. The calculated results further prove the close dependence of the transporting characteristics of molecular junctions on contact configuration. © 2011 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84859589860	Numerical analysis on optical limiting performance of a series of phthalocyanines for nanosecond pulses	The optical limiting properties of a series of peripherally substituted phthalocyanines with different central metals and axial chloride ligand for nanosecond pulses have been studied by solving numerically the two-dimensional paraxial field equation together with the rate equations using the CrankNicholson method. It is shown that all of these compounds exhibit good optical limiting behaviour, and phthalocyanines with heavier central metals have better optical limiting performance due to the faster intersystem crossing caused by the enhanced spinorbit coupling. The major mechanism of optical limiting for long pulses is the sequential (singletsinglet) ×(triplettriplet) nonlinear absorption. Dynamics of populations is characterized mainly by the effective transfer time of the population from the ground state to the lowest triplet state. The long lifetime of the triplet state is important but not determinant. In addition, the performance of optical limiting strongly depends on the thickness and concentration of the absorber. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84863180172	Theoretical studies on protonation-induced inversion of the rectifying direction in dipyrimidinyl-diphenyl diblock molecular junctions	The protonation effects on electron transport through a conjugated dipyrimidinyl-diphenyl diblock oligomer sandwiched between two gold electrodes were theoretically investigated using the fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. All configurations of protonation on the dipyrimidinyl group of the molecule were considered. The numerical results show that the protonation prefers to improve electron transport ability through the molecular junction. The transmission spectra around the Fermi energy are tuned by the number and locations of protons residing in the molecular junction. It is found that the protonation in the outer pyrimidinyl is favorable for enhancing the rectification ratio, while the protonation in the inner pyrimidinyl plays a dominative role for inverting the rectifying direction. This theoretical work for the first time presents a mechanism for the experimental findings of inversion of the rectifying effect in diblock molecular diodes caused by protonation [J. Am. Chem.

Effects of asymmetric interfaces caused by both the anchoring groups and/or contact geometries of electrodes have been investigated. Our results showed that the rectifying behavior of the co-oligomer diode could be reversed or largely enhanced by adjusting asymmetric anchoring groups. Whether the asymmetric contact geometries play a positive or negative role in improving the rectifying behavior is closely related to each molecular diode. The mechanism of modulation was analyzed in terms of molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian states and transmission spectra. The theoretical simulations are helpful for understanding recent experimental results [Lee et al. Langmuir2009, 25, 1495 and Hihath et al. ACS Nano2011, 5, 8331].

The numerical results show that, for a bi-OPE-molecule junction, the offset face-to-face configuration induces more delocalized molecular orbitals, and results in higher conductivity than the parallel face-to-face configuration, so it can be used as a molecular switch. The side substituent groups containing more delocalized electrons can strengthen the intermolecular coupling and raise the conductivities of bi-OPE-monothiol molecular devices. On the basis of the investigations, we find a scheme to enhance the open - close ratios of bimolecular switches. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

A computational scheme is developed to simulate a proton attached to an atom. The numerical results show that large changes in both one-and two-photon absorption properties are observed when the compound is transformed from neutral to threefold protonated states. When the compound is protonated, more charge transfer states appear and the absorption band has a red-shift. Furthermore, the two-photon absorption cross-section is largely enhanced. The theoretical calculations demonstrate the protonation effect on promoting the intramolecular charge transfer strength. The results present qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.

84885616455	Bias dependence of rectifying direction in a diblock Co-oligomer molecule with graphene nanoribbon electrodes	By applying nonequilibrium Green's function method in combination with density functional theory, we study the rectifying properties of dipyrimidinyl-diphenyl co-oligomer molecules embedded in a carbon atomic chain sandwiched between two graphene nanoribbon (GNR) electrodes. Both the length of the carbon atomic chains and the edge geometry of the graphene nanoribbon electrodes are shown to play a significant role in determining the conductance behavior and rectifying performance of the molecular devices. As for GNRs with zigzag edges, the parallel (perpendicular) conformation between the principal plane of the molecule and the zigzag-edged GNR electrode is observed to be dependent on the odd (even) number of carbon atoms in the carbon chain, whereas for armchair-edged GNRs the parallel (perpendicular) case corresponds to an even (odd) number of carbon atoms. Taking an asymmetric arrangement of armchair and zigzag GNR electrodes, we demonstrate a molecular device having very interesting rectifying behaviors with marked rectification ratios at low bias voltages and inversion of rectifying direction when the bias voltage is large. Analysis of the transmission coefficients and molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian as well as band structures of the electrodes under various external bias voltages reveals an underlying mechanism of the observed results. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Our results show that the rectifying behaviors of the co-oligomer diode are significantly modulated by isomeric substitution of anchoring groups. When the isomeride nitrile end group is replaced by the isocyanide one, for symmetric arrangement of electrodes, the rectifying direction shows obvious inversion for the isocyanide-diblock-thiol junction, and the rectification ratio is obviously enhanced for the thiol-diblock-isocyanide junction.

The hybrid density functional theory is embraced to optimize the geometry of the molecule and the time-dependent density functional theory is used to study the nonlinear optical properties of the molecule. Simulation of the solvent effects is carried out by the self-consistent reaction field theory with the polarizable continuum model. The numerical results show that three-state model is good enough to give the two-photon absorption cross section for the lowest excited states, which is consistent with experimental measurement quite well. As the increase of the polarity of solvent, the wavelength of single photon is red-shifted and the two-photon absorption cross section is increased slightly.

Interestingly, an inversion of rectifying direction induced by stretching or contracting the molecular junctions, which is closely related to the number of the pyrimidinyl-phenyl units, is proposed. The analysis of the molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian and the evolution of the frontier molecular orbitals as well as transmission coefficients under external biases gives an inside view of the observed results.

The frontier orbit theory and the perturbation theory are employed to determine constant of the interaction energy quantitatively, which is a parameter in describing the current-voltage properties of molecular wires by the elastic scattering Green function method. The numerical results show that the bonding between the sulfur atom and the gold atoms corresponds mainly to the covalent bond. Some molecular orbits are extended over molecule and gold cluster that certainly give channels for the charge transport, other molecular orbits are localized and the charge transport can take place by tunnel mechanism.

10844284700	Theoretical study on the nonlinear optical properties of para-nitroaniline in different solvents	The solvent effects on the nonlinear optical properties of para-nitroaniline (pNA) molecule are studied on the base of time dependent density functional theory. The polarized continuum model is used to simulate the influence of the solvent environment on the solute molecule. In the first place, the geometrical structures of pNA molecule in each solvent are optimized by use of density functional theory and the influence of solvent on the geometry of pNA molecule is thus illustrated. Then, the energies and dipole moments of the excited states with pNA molecule in different solvents are computed on the base of time dependent density functional theory. The dispersion relations of the first-order nonlinear hyperpolarizabilities in second harmonic generation process for pNA molecule in different solvents are given by using two-state model for the first time. It is shown that polar solvents have much influence on the nonlinear optical properties. At low frequency radiation field, the theoretical results of the dispersion relation agree well with the experimental results. While at higher frequency radiation field, other methods need to be developed to compute the dispersion relation of the first order nonlinear hyperpolarizability. At last, possible explanations are given for the results and the validity of the two-state model is discussed.

13444283980	A theoretical study of electrical properties of molecular junction	Based on the first principle, electrical properties of a molecular junction consisting of pyrene-1, 8-dithiol molecule and gold surface have been investigated. The cluster of three gold atoms is used to simulate the gold surface. Density functional theory is employed to obtain the electronic structures of the molecule and the extended molecule. Then the frontier orbital theory and the perturbation theory are used to determine the interaction energy between the molecule and the gold surface quantitatively. The elastic Green function method is applied to study the current-voltage properties of the molecular junction. Numerical results show that the sulfur atoms can be chemically absorbed on the gold surface and the bonding between the molecule and gold is mainly covalent-typed. The fermi-energy of the extended molecular system lies between the HOMO and the LUMO and closer to the HOMO of the system. When the external applied bias is lower than 1 V, there is a current gap for the molecular junction. With the increasing of the bias, the conductance of the junction exhibits plateaus. These electrical properties are closely related with the electronic structures of the molecular junction. The extended molecular orbits have great contribution to the charge transport. Localized molecular orbits give little contribution to the current while charge transport is taken place by tunneling.
