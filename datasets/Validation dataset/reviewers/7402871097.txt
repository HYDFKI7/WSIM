9444249827	Relationship of serum leptin with age, body weight, body mass index, and bone mineral density in healthy mainland Chinese women	Serum leptin concentration is associated with age, fat and bone mineral density (BMD), and there are ethnic differences in physique and BMD values. The relationship between serum leptin concentration and BMD in Chinese women is presently unknown. We examined the relationship of serum leptin concentration with age, body weight, BMI and BMD in mainland Chinese women. Serum leptin concentration in a population of 676 Chinese females, aged 20-80 years (45.4±14.8 years, mean±S.D.), was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). BMD values were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at a number of sites: the posteroanterior lumbar spine (PA, L1-L4), lateral lumbar spine (Lat, L2-L4), hip (including the femoral neck (FN) and total hip (T-hip)), and forearm (one-third region (RU1/3) and total region (RUT)). The relationship between changes in serum leptin concentration with age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and BMD values at six sites were analyzed using 10 different regression models, and the models giving the best fit were selected. The cubic regression model best described the changes in serum leptin concentration with age (R

16344362454	Relationships between circulating matrix metalloproteinase-1, -2 and metalloproteinase-1 levels and bone biochemical markers and bone mineral density in Chinese postmenopausal women	Objective: To study the serum matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) levels, and the correlations of MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 with bone turn-over markers and bone mineral density (BMD) in aged postmenopausal Chinese women. Methods: The serum MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1, serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), serum osteocalcin (OC), serum cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) of 297 Chinese female volunteers aged 48-89 were measured using ELISA. BMD were measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in aged postmenopausal Chinese women. Results: (1) There were no significant negative relationships between MMP-1, TIMP-1 and BMD and bone biochemical markers. (2) A weak negative relationships were found between MMP-2 and BMD. Adjusted by age and body weight, the correlation of MMP-2 with BMD of neck of femur and hip disappeared. (3) Positive correlations between MMP-2 and BAP, OC, NTX was found (all r = 0.193,0.231,0.249, P < 0.01) (4) Serum MMP-2 concentrations were significantly higher in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (1466 μg/L ± 313 μg/L) than in age-matched normal controls (1222 μg/L ± 243 μg/L) and osteopenia subjects (1282 μg/L ± 220 μg/L). Conclusion: There are significant correlations between serum MMP-2 and bone metabolism, and MMP-2 may increase with increases in bone-turnover. The increases of serum MMP-2 appear possibly as a concomitant event in high bone turnover state, such as postmenopausal osteoporosis.

1542376111	Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) is down-regulated in estrogen-deficient rat osteoblast in vivo	Our previous study showed that estrogen stimulates membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MT1 -MMP) production in osteoblastic cells culture, but has no effect on MMP-2 and TIMP-2 synthesis. Osteoblast-derived MT1-MMP have been recently implied to play a role in bone metabolism by degrading tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α , resolving extracellular matrix and activating proMMP-2, which requires the process of activation mediated by MT1-MMP/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-2) complex on the cell surface. To investigate the mechanism of bone loss following estrogen deficiency, we examined the effects of estrogen on osteoblast synthesis of MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and TIMP-2. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry of rat bone samples were used to document the synthesis of MT1-MMP, MMP-2, and TIMP-2 mRNA and protein. Osteoblasts from distal femoral head showed an increase in the pattern of MT1-MMP mRNA and protein production in sham-operated controls and 17β-estradiol (E

16644370637	Effects of 17β-estradiol on the expression of interstitial collagenases-8 and -13 (MMP-8 and MMP-13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in ovariectomized rat osteoblastic cells	Estrogen plays an important role in maintaining normal bone metabolism via the direct or indirect regulation of bone cells. Osteoblastic cells, as the target cells of estrogen, can secrete multiple matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that participate in bone remodeling. It has been demonstrated that bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency is closely related to the abnormal expression of multiple MMPs in osteoblastic cells. However, the regulating action of estrogen on the expression of interstitial collagenases MMP-8 and MMP-13 in osteoblastic cells in vivo remains unclear. We used an ovariectomized osteoporotic rat model to analyze the changes in the histomorphometric parameters of bone after and without treatment with 17β-estradiol (E

23944517324	Adiponectin stimulates human osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation via the MAPK signaling pathway	Adipocytes can highly and specifically express adiponectin, and the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR) has been detected in bone-forming cells. The present study was undertaken to investigate the action of adiponectin on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. AdipoR1 protein was detected in human osteoblasts. Adiponectin promoted osteoblast proliferation and resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen production, and an increase in mineralized matrix. Suppression of AdipoR1 with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation and ALP expression. Adiponectin induces activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), but not ERK1/2 in osteoblasts, and these effects were blocked by suppression of AdipoR1 with siRNA. Furthermore, pretreatment of osteoblasts with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished the adiponectin-induced cell proliferation. p38 inhibitor SB203580 blocked the adiponectin-induced ALP activity. These data indicate that adiponectin induces human osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and the proliferation response is mediated by the AdipoR/JNK pathway, while the differentiation response is mediated via the AdipoR/p38 pathway. These findings suggest that osteoblasts are the direct targets of adiponectin. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

25844501515	Comparison of spine and femur reference data in native Chinese women from different regions of China	The aim of this study is to explore the differences of BMD reference curves at various skeletal sites among Chinese women from different regions of China and to investigate the feasibility of establishing a unified national BMD reference database for Chinese women. We measured BMD at the posteroanterior (PA) lumbar spine, femoral neck, trochanter and Ward's triangle by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry bone densitometer in 3,422 Changsha women of South Central China, aged 20-84 years. The documented BMDs of reference populations of women in all other areas included Shanghai ( n =2,111) and Nanjing ( n =3,174) in the East, Shenyang ( n =1,213) in the Northeast, Kunming ( n =523) in the Southwest, Chongqing ( n =811) in the Midwest and Xian ( n =1,320) in the Northwest. We adopted the cubic regression as the fitting model for reference curves of BMD that varied with age, conducted conversions of BMD measured by various bone densitometers from different manufacturers and compared the differences between standardized BMD (sBMD) reference curves and combined ones for women from different areas. Our results revealed that by comparing variances in women from different areas, the average variances of non-standard BMD were 0.8-30.8% at the PA spine, 0.7-24.5% at the femoral neck, 0.6-29.9% at the trochanter and 1.1-54.7% at Ward's triangle, while average variances of sBMD either significantly decreased or disappeared (0.8-3.9% at the PA spine, 0.7-8.6% at the femoral neck, 0.6-8.3% at the trochanter and 1.1-29.9% at Ward's triangle). The sBMD reference curves were highly positive-dependent with combined ones ( r =0.913-0.999, P =0.000). At the PA spine and trochanter, the effect of combined sBMD curves presented well in women from different areas, except for those from Shanghai at the PA spine and Shenyang at the trochanter, indicating that sBMD curves were significantly different from pooled ones; at the femoral neck and Ward's triangle, the effect of combined sBMD reference curves was poor, indicating that sBMD curves demonstrated significant differences from pooled ones in women from a majority of these areas. We conclude that, in high density population areas, sBMD reference curves showed no significant geographic differences in women from various regions. In women from different areas, sBMD reference curves present good pooled results at the PA spine and trochanter. The less ideal combining effect of the sBMD curves at both femoral neck and Ward's triangle might be caused by the intrinsic differences from the different measuring instruments. © International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2005.

33645227609	Relationship of circulating MMP-2, MMP-1, and TIMP-1 levels with bone biochemical markers and bone mineral density in postmenopausal Chinese women	Introduction: Osteoblast-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 have been shown to play a role in bone metabolism by degrading the bone matrix. Methods: The present study was performed to investigate the relationships between serum MMP-2, MMP-1, or TIMP-1 levels and bone mineral density (BMD), as well as bone biochemical markers, in 297 Chinese postmenopausal women aged 42-80 years. Results: We found a significant negative weak correlation between MMP-2 and BMD at various skeletal regions. After adjustment for age and BMI, the correlation with BMD at the femoral neck and total hip disappeared. Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that MMP-2 was not a determinant factor for BMD. The significant positive correlations between MMP-2 and bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC) and were found, and remained significant after adjustment for age and BMI. Moreover, serum MMP-2 concentrations were significantly higher in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis than in age-matched normal controls. There were no significant correlations between MMP-1, TIMP-1 and BMD. There were no significant relationships between MMP-1 and BAP, OC, and NTX. The associations between TIMP-1 and BAP and OC were not specific and constant. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results suggest that circulating MMP-2 and markers of bone turnover are correlated, and serum MMP-2 levels may rise with increase in bone turnover. © International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2005.

33646172369	Apelin and its receptor are expressed in human osteoblasts	Objectives: Apelin is a recently discovered peptide that is the endogenous ligand for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor APJ. Adipocytes can express and secrete apelin. The aim of this study was to characterize apelin and APJ expression in human osteoblasts and to investigate the effects of apelin on osteoblasts. Results: Apelin and APJ were expressed in human osteoblasts. Apelin stimulated proliferation of human osteoblasts, but had no effect on alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen production in human osteoblasts. Suppression of APJ with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the apelin-induced cell proliferation. Apelin induced activation of Akt (Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase downstream effector), but not MAPKs, such as c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38 and ERK1/2 in human osteoblasts. This effect was blocked by suppression of APJ with siRNA. Furthermore, LY294002 (PI3 kinase inhibitor) blocked the activation of Akt by apelin and abolished the apelin-induced cell proliferation. Conclusions: Human osteoblasts express apelin and APJ and apelin enhances human osteoblast proliferation, but has no effect on osteoblast differentiation, and APJ/PI3 kinase/Akt pathway is involved in the proliferation response. These findings suggest that apelin may function as a mitogenic agent for osteoblasts. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33646596944	Tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 suppresses apoptosis of mouse bone marrow stromal cell line MBA-1	We investigated the action of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) on apoptosis and differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cell line MBA-1. TIMP-1 did not affect alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, suggesting that it is not involved in osteoblastic differentiation in MBA-1 cells. However, TIMP-1 inhibited MBA-1 apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in a dose-dependent manner. Our study also showed increased Bcl-2 protein expression and decreased Bax protein expression with TIMP-1 treatment. TIMP-1 decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in MBA-1 cells. TIMP-1 activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or the JNK inhibitor SP600125 abolished its antiapoptotic activity. To investigate whether antiapoptotic action of TIMP-1 was mediated through its inhibition on MMP activities, we constructed mutant TIMP-1 by side-directed mutagenesis, which abolished the inhibitory activity of MMPs by deletion of Cys1 to Ala4. Wild-type TIMP-1 and mutant TIMP-1 expression plasmids were transfected in MBA-1 cells, and results showed that mutant TIMP-1 still protected the induced MBA-1 cell against apoptosis. These data suggest that TIMP-1 antiapoptotic actions are mediated via the PI3-kinase and JNK signaling pathways and independent of TIMP-1 inhibition of MMP activities. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

33746688505	Serum concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 in Chinese women: Age-related changes, and the relationships with bone biochemical markers, bone mineral density	Background: Osteoblast-derived matrix metalloproteinse-1 (MMP-1), MMP-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) play a role in bone metabolism by degrading bone matrix. Methods: We measured MMP-1, MMMP-2, TIMP-1 and associated results with age and bone metabolism in 591 Chinese women aged 20-80 y. Results: Serum MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 concentrations exhibited positive correlation with age. Serum concentrations of MMP-1 were higher in 40-69 y old women. The concentrations of MMP-2 were significantly increased in the 50-69 y olds. Serum TIMP-1 concentrations were significantly lower in women aged 30-59 y, and then these were followed by an increase at > 60 y olds. We found a significant negative weaker correlation between MMP-2 and BMD. But multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that MMP-2 was not a determinant factor for BMD. There were significant positive correlations between MMP-2 and bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC), and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX). Conclusions: The serum concentrations of MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 exhibit age-related changes, and circulating MMP-2 and bone turnover are related. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: We randomly divided 144 female SD rats (aged 7-month-old) into 12 groups (12 in each). In addition, 120 female SD rats aged 4-month were randomly divided into 10 groups (10 in each). Three dosage levels of CNT (0.039, 0.117 and 0.39 mg/kg body weight, daily), nylestriol (NYL, 0.30, 0.09 and 0.03 mg/kg body weight, daily) and levonorgestrel (LEV, 0.09, 0.027 and 0.009 mg/kg body weight, daily) were designed to prevent the bone loss of the osteoporotic rat model induced by RA and OVX respectively. Serum total calcium (Ca), phosphate (Pi), ALP, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-C, total bodyBMD, isolated left femoral BMD and femoral Ca, and Pi after ashing were determined. Results: Osteoporotic models could be induced by RA (70 mg/kg body weight daily given intragastrically for 14 days) or by ovariectomy;CNT and its components had the preventive effects on bone loss in both models; The preventive effect of CNT was dose-dependent and stronger than its components; Many observed markers showed us the levels of high and moderate CNT given to be the strongest, corresponding to an optimal choice of the moderate dose CNT about one tablet per week in adult women. Conclusions: CNT therapy can prevent the bone loss of RA-induced and OVX-induced osteoporotic rats, and its therapeutic and preventive effect is better than its components used alone.

Methods: Western Blotting was used to analyze the expression of MMP-14 in cultured media. The effect of RMC on activation of proMMP-2 was measured by gelatin zymograms analysis, and the influence of RMC on cells adhesion was analyzed as well. The apoptosis was detected by acidine orange/ethidium bromide staining and EL ISA. Results: RMC activated proMMP-2 secreted into media by SaOS-2 cells, and this process was blocked by EDTA treatment. RMC inhibited the adhesion of SaOS-2 cells to immobilized Type I collagen in a dose-dependent manner, which was also abolished by EDTA. RMC induced SaOS-2 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and apop to sis-inducing activity of MMP-14 catalytic domain was blocked by EDTA. Conclusion: Since adhesion of cells to extracellular matrix serves as a survival mechanism in osteoblasts, the catalytic activity of recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain on matrix proteins contributes to its apoptosis-inducing activity.

33749244468	Adiponectin stimulates RANKL and inhibits OPG expression in human osteoblasts through the MAPK signaling pathway	Our study indicates that recombinant adiponectin induced RANKL and inhibited OPG expression in human osteoblasts through the AdipoR1/p38 MAPK pathway, and these responses contributed to the adiponectin-induced osteoclasts formation in the co-culture of osteoblast and peripheral blood monocytes systems. These findings showed that adiponectin increased osteoclast formation indirectly through stimulating RANKL and inhibiting OPG production in osteoblasts. It also suggests the pharmacological nature of recombinant adiponectin that indirectly induces osteoclasts formation. Introduction: Recently, adiponectin has emerged as an element in the regulation of bone metabolism, but the mechanism remains. This study was undertaken to investigate the action of adiponectin on osteoclastogenesis through revealing RANKL and osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in osteoblasts and osteoclast formation. Materials and Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA were used to detect RANKL and OPG mRNA and protein expression in cultured human osteoblasts. The involved signal pathway was studied using mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) siRNA. The effects of recombinant adiponectin on osteoclasts formation also were examined in the co-culture systems of osteoblast and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) systems or purified CD14 + PBMCs cultures. Results: Our study showed that recombinant adiponectin induced RANKL and inhibited OPG mRNA expression in human osteoblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Adiponectin also increased soluble RANKL and decreased OPG secretion in osteoblasts conditioned media. Suppression of AdipoR1 with siRNA abolished the adiponectin-regulated RANKL and OPG mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Furthermore, pretreatment of osteoblasts with the MAPK inhibitor SB203580 abolished adiponectin-regulated RANKL and OPG mRNA expression. Adiponectin induced osteoclast formation in the co-culture systems of osteoblast and PBMCs systems, and OPG entirely blocked this response. However, adiponectin had no direct effect on the differentiation of osteoclast precursor purified CD14 + PBMCs. Conclusions: These data indicate that recombinant adiponectin induced RANKL and inhibited OPG expression in human osteoblasts through the AdipoR1/p38 MAPK pathway, and these responses contributed to the adiponectin-induced osteoclast formation in the co-culture of osteoblast and PBMCs systems. These findings showed that adiponectin increased osteoclast formation indirectly through stimulating RANKL and inhibiting OPG production in osteoblasts. It suggests the pharmacological nature of recombinant adiponectin that indirectly induces osteoclasts formation. © 2006 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Adipocytes can express and secrete apelin. Osteoblast can express apelin and APJ. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of apelin on apoptosis of human osteoblasts. Results: Apelin inhibited human osteoblasts apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Suppression of APJ with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the anti-apoptotic activity of apelin. Our study also showed an increased Bcl-2 protein expression and decreased Bax protein expression under the treatment of apelin. Apelin decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in human osteoblasts. Apelin activated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) and Akt. The apelin-induced activation of Akt was blocked by suppression of APJ with siRNA. LY294002 (a PI-3 kinase inhibitor) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (HIMO; an Akt inhibitor) abolished apelin induced activation of Akt, and, LY294002 or HIMO abolished the anti-apoptotic activity of apelin. Furthermore, apelin protects against apoptosis induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. Conclusions: Apelin suppresses serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of human osteoblasts and the anti-apoptotic action is mediated via the APJ/PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

Methods: The bone mineral density (BMD) at anteroposterior lumber, proximal femur and distal radius in 220 women of Mawangdui Township, aged 36-60, was measured twice, March to April 2000 and March to April 2004, using a Hologic QDR 4500A fan beam X-ray bone densitometer. Results: The annual bone loss rate was the highest during the period of 1 to 5 years since menopause, showing an annual bone loss of 1.70% at the anteroposterior spine, and 2.21%, 1.92%, and 1.56% at the femoral neck, greater trochanter, and distal radius respectively. Even before menopause bone loss was found at the femoral neck and distal radius. BMD loss at the anteroposterior spine and greater trochanter was found in the peri-menopause group. The bone loss rate was the highest in the early menopause group (1.56%/year, P < 0.01), and became lower, however, not significantly in the late menopause group (0.38%/year, P > 0.05). Age was positively correlated with the annual bone loss rates at the anteroposterior spine, greater trochanter, and distal radius (γ = 0.223-0.547, P < 0.05-0.01). and the number of year since menopause was also positively correlated with the annual bone loss rate at anteroposterior spine and greater trochanter (γ = 0.432-0.569 P < 0.05-0.01). However, body weight and body mass index were negatively correlated with the annual bone loss rates at the anteroposterior spine, femoral neck, and greater trochanter (γ = 0.239-0.466, P < 0.05-0.01). Conclusion: Annual bone loss varies at different skeletal region. Age, years since menopause, and body weight influence the bone loss at different skeletal regions in females.

33947150636	Insulin-like effects of visfatin on human osteoblasts	Visfatin (also known as pre-B cell colony-enhancing factor or PBEF) is a novel adipocytokine that is highly expressed in visceral fat and upregulated in obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Visfatin binds to and activates the insulin receptor (IR), thereby exerting insulin-mimetic effects in various cell lines. IR has been detected in osteoblasts, which is consistent with the role of insulin as an important osteotropic hormone. This study investigated the actions of visfatin on human primary osteoblasts. The expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of IR, IR substrate-1 (IRS-1), and IRS-2 were determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Cell proliferation was determined by measuring [

APJ was expressed in MC3T3-E1 cells. Apelin did not affect Runx2 expression, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, osteocalcin and type I collagen secretion, suggesting that it has no effect on osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. However, apelin stimulated MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Our study also shows that apelin decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3, capase-8 and caspase-9 activation in serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 cells. Apelin activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase downstream effector), and the JNK inhibitor SP600125, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor LY294002 or the Akt inhibitor 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (HIMO) inhibited its effects on proliferation and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, apelin protected against apoptosis induced by the glucocorticoid dexamethasone or TNF-α. Apelin stimulates proliferation and suppresses serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells and these actions are mediated via JNK and PI3-K/Akt signaling pathways. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34147121473	Taurine promotes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression in osteoblasts through the ERK signal pathway	Taurine is found in bone tissue, but its function in skeletal tissue is not fully understood. The present study was undertaken to investigate regulation of gene expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in murine osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells treated with taurine. Western blot analysis showed taurine stimulated CTGF protein secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Taurine induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not p38 and c-jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), in osteoblasts. Furthermore, pretreatment of osteoblasts with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the taurine-induced CTGF production. These data indicate that taurine induces CTGF secretion in MC3T3-E1 cells mediated by the ERK pathway, and suggest that osteoblasts are direct targets of taurine. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

To review and analyze the relationship between adiponectin and bone metabolism. Data sources: The related articles were searched in Medline between January 1995 and July 2006 with the key words of "adiponectin, bone" and "adiponectin, bone mineral density" in English. Study selection: After the first check up the articles about clinical or basic studies of adiponectin were selected and the obviously unrelated articles were excluded. The full texts of the rest articles were searched for to further judge whether they were accordant with the inclusive criteria: 1 basis studies, and 2 clinical research relevant to human disease. Data extraction: Totally 163 articles were related to adiponectin in which were cited on the basis of the quality of experimental studies, and these studies 78 relevance to human disease, including 12 articles about the summary of adiponectin, 33 about the study of adiponectin and bone metabolism, and a total of 31 closely related and representative articles were reviewed. Data synthesis: 1 Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, possessed anti-hyperglycemic, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties because of its influence on glucose and lipid metabolism. 2 In vitro and animal studies showed that adiponectin increased bone mass by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and possibly by activating osteoblasto-genesis, adiponectin actions on bone formation through three distinct pathways: a positive action through the autocrine/paracrine pathway by locally produced adiponectin, a negative action through the direct pathway by circulating adiponectin, and a positive action through the indirect pathway by circulating adiponectin via enhancement of the insulin signaling. Human cross-sectional studies about the role of adiponectin in bone metabolism also were not conclusive. 3 Although some authors had reported a negative association between serum leptin levels and bone mineral density (BMD), others failed to find any relationship. Conclusion: Adiponectin, one of the hormones secreted from adipose tissues, is initially proposed to possess anti-hyperglycemic, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties because of its influence on glucose and lipid metabolism. Now, it is realized that adiponectin is involved in bone metabolism by affecting the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts by 3 different pathways of internal secretion and paracrine secretion. More basic and clinical studies are necessary to consolidate adiponectin's role in the physiology of bone tissues. In a word, the correlation of adiponectin with bone transformation and BMD provides some new directions for the prevention and treatment of bone metabolism associated diseases.

34347363060	Differences in age-related bone mass of proximal femur between Chinese women and different ethnic women in the United States	Substantial racial differences in bone mass and bone loss rate have been reported, but the extent of the difference between native Chinese women and women of different races in the United States is not clear. We used a DXA bone densitometer to measure bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone area (BA), and volumetric BMD (vBMD) in different regions of the proximal femur in 3614 Chinese women aged 20 years and older. Regression models were chosen to best fit the changes of these parameters with increasing age. The values in their fitted curves were determined by the Cartesian coordinate numeration system. Subsequently, we compared these fitted curves to full-matched data of non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American women reported by the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). We found that all fitted curves of bone mass of non-Hispanic black women were significantly higher than those of Chinese, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American women (P = 0.000). The BMD and BMC fitted curves in various regions of the hip for non-Hispanic blacks were 22%-28% and 26%-43% higher than those for Chinese women, 8.3%-13% and 7.9%-9.5% higher than those for non-Hispanic whites, and 8.8%-10% and 13%-19% higher than those for Mexican Americans, respectively. However, when the expression of difference was transformed from BMD to vBMD at the femoral neck, the difference between Chinese and non-Hispanic black women was reduced from 22% to 18% and that between Chinese and non-Hispanic white women from 7.4% to 0.8%, but the difference increased from 3.2% to 9.6% between non-Hispanic white and Mexican American women and from 13% to 17% between non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women. By the age of 80 years, the accumulated bone loss rate in various regions of the proximal femur for Chinese, Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic whites, and non-Hispanic blacks were -38.9% ± 1.8%, -34.4% ± 3.1%, -27.8% ± 5.9%, and -28.4% ± 4.8%, respectively. In conclusion, bone mass in the proximal femur of native Chinese women is significantly lower, and the bone loss rate greater, than those of non-Asian women in the United States. At the femoral neck, the vBMD of Chinese women is similar to that of non-Hispanic white women. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

36649019977	Effects of the sample size of reference population on determining BMD reference curve and peak BMD and diagnosing osteoporosis	Summary: Establishing reference databases generally requires a large sample size to achieve reliable results. Our study revealed that the varying sample size from hundreds to thousands of individuals has no decisive effect on the bone mineral density (BMD) reference curve, peak BMD, and diagnosing osteoporosis. It provides a reference point for determining the sample size while establishing local BMD reference databases. Introduction: This study attempts to determine a suitable sample size for establishing bone mineral density (BMD) reference databases in a local laboratory. Methods: The total reference population consisted of 3,662 Chinese females aged 6-85 years. BMDs were measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry densitometer. The subjects were randomly divided into four different sample groups, that is, total number (Tn) = 3,662, 1/2n=1,831, 1/4n=916, and 1/8n=458. We used the best regression model to determine BMD reference curve and peak BMD. Results: There was no significant difference in the full curves between the four sample groups at each skeletal site, although some discrepancy at the end of the curves was observed at the spine. Peak BMDs were very similar in the four sample groups. According to the Chinese diagnostic criteria (BMD >25% below the peak BMD as osteoporosis), no difference was observed in the osteoporosis detection rate using the reference values determined by the four different sample groups. Conclusions: Varying the sample size from hundreds to thousands has no decisive effect on establishing BMD reference curve and determining peak BMD. It should be practical for determining the reference population while establishing local BMD databases. © 2007 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.

35649008827	WISP3 suppresses insulin-like growth factor signaling in human chondrocytes	WISP3 is essential for maintaining cartilage integrity mainly by regulating the expression of collagen II, and mutations of WISP3 linked to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tarda with progressive arthropathy (SEDT-PA) can compromise this function and lead to cartilage loss. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of WISP3 on insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling in human chondrocytes, investigate whether WISP3 up-regulates collagen II through the IGF signaling pathway, and compare IGF signaling between wild-type and mutant WISP3. Experimental results suggest that WISP3 up-regulates collagen II expression and inhibits the activation of IGF-IR, IRS-1, and ERK kinase in human chondrocytes, and mutation of WISP3 augments IGF signaling in human chondrocytes. In addition to the IGF signaling pathway, WISP3 might up-regulate collagen II expression through an IGF-independent signaling cascade. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

38649093010	Relationship between age-related reference values of serum osteoprotegerin and leptin in native Chinese women and compared with those in women of other races	Background: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) and leptin are important cellular factors in the regulation of bone remodeling. We investigated the serum OPG and leptin in Chinese women. Methods: The serum OPG and leptin in 690 Chinese women aged 20-81y were measured by an ELISA. The values of OPG and leptin in women of other races were acquired from previous reports on the same. Results: The geometric mean values (± SD) of the serum OPG and leptin in Chinese women were 3.42 ± 1.91pmol/l and 10.5 ± 1.99μg/l, respectively. Further, the serum OPG (4.39 ± 1.85 vs 2.74 ± 1.81) and leptin (11.4 ± 2.21 vs 9.68 ± 1.81) in postmenopausal women were significantly higher than in premenopausal women. The serum OPG in middle-aged Chinese women was significantly higher than that in middle-aged Austrian and Icelandic women; however, this is quite contrary to the results obtained in the case of old-aged women. The values of serum leptin in Chinese women were significantly lower than those in white, black, and Mexican American women. Conclusions: These results provide reliable reference values for OPG and leptin in Chinese adult women. The serum of OPG and leptin differ with ethnicity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33344457017	Relationship between polymorphism of parathyroid hormone and bone mineral density and relevant biochemical indicators in women	Objective: To investigate the distribution of parathyroid hormone (PTH) gene polymorphisms and the relationships of PTH gene polymorphisms with bone mass and serum bone relative biochemical markers. Methods: Blood samples of 314 normal female volunteers, aged 20-80, were collected. Serum PTH, bone alkaline phosphatase (sBAP), cross-linked N-telopeptide of collagen type I (sNTX), cross-linked C-telopeptide of collagen type I (sCTX), osteoprotegrin (OPG) and leptin were determined by ELISA. Polymorphisms of PTH gene were detected by polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) of restriction enzyme BstBI. BMD (QDR4500A) of the anteroposterior spine (AP), supine lateral spine(Lat), and femoral neck (FN) were measured. Results: (1) The genotype frequency of BB, Bb, and bb were 75.8%, 23.3% and 0.9% respectively in normal females volunteers. The frequencies of RFLP alleles B and b were 87.5% and 12.5% respectively. There was no difference in the polymorphism frequency of PTH gene between the post- and pre menopausal women. (2) There were no significant differences in the BMD of the AP, Lat, and FN and the serum biochemical markers between the BB and Bb genotypes. (3) Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that PTH did not influence the BMD values. Conclusion: PTH gene polymorphism has no relationship with bone mass and serum bone biochemical markers in normal females.

57949105638	Relationship of age-related concentrations of serum FSH and LH with bone mineral density, prevalence of osteoporosis in native Chinese women	Background: Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) may play an important role in bone mass regulation in postmenopausal women. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 699 healthy Chinese women, aged 20 to 82 y, was conducted. Serum FSH and LH and BMD were measured at the posteroanterior (PA) spine, lateral spine, total hip, and distal forearm. Results: The geometric mean values (± SD) of serum FSH and LH in premenopausal women were 3.94 ± 2.08 and 7.51 ± 2.58 IU/l, respectively, and in postmenopausal women were 28.8 ± 1.88 and 25.6 ± 1.95 IU/l, respectively. The correlation of FSH to BMD at different skeletal regions (r = - 0.597 - - 0.492, P = 0.000) was higher than that of LH to BMD (r = - 0.452 - - 0.332, P = 0.000). The prevalences of osteoporosis for the quartiles of FSH at various skeletal sites were 0.57%, 0.43%, 27.1%, and 30.9%, respectively; and of LH were 2.14%, 4.43%, 19.5%, and 26.0%, respectively. The prevalence of osteoporosis in 3rd and 4th quartile was more significantly increased than the 1st and 2nd quartile. Conclusions: These data suggest that FSH and LH levels in circulation are associated with BMD changes and osteoporosis occurrence in Chinese women. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0034896394	Progesterone differentially regulates the membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) compartment of proMMP-2 activation in MG-63 cells	Osteoblast-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are considered to play a crucial role in bone formation and initiation of bone resorption by degrading the bone matrix. MMP-2 is constitutively secreted in a latent zymogen by osteoblasts, and requires the process of activation mediated by membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP)/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-2) complex in the cell surface. Bone is one target tissue for progestins. In the present study, we observed the effects of progesterone on proMMP-2 activation and MT1-MMP expression, and also TIMP-2 levels in osteoblastic MG-63 cells. Gelatin zymograms and ELISA showed that progesterone have no effects on proMMP-2 activation. Using Western immunoblot analysis, we unexpectedly found that treatment with increasing doses of progesterone in MG-63 cells caused a dose-dependent increase in expression of MT1-MMP protein, and after 48 h treatment, progesterone at 10

77954141869	The relationship between the levels of gonadotropic hormones and OPG, leptin, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in Chinese adult women	Background: The relationship between the levels of gonadotropic hormones and bone metabolism-related cytokines in Chinese women is unclear. We investigated the relationship between FSH and LH and OPG, leptin, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 in Chinese women. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 694 Chinese women, aged 20 to 82. y was conducted. Levels of serum FSH, LH, OPG, leptin, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 were determined. Results: In premenopausal females, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels seemly showed no correlation with the cytokine levels. In perimenopausal females, serum FSH and LH levels showed significant positive correlation with osteoprotegerin (OPG) and transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) levels (r=0.286 to 0.405, all P=0.000), whereas they showed negative correlation with TGF-β1 levels (r=- 0.413 and - 0.354, all P=0.000). In postmenopausal females, FSH and LH levels showed positive correlation with OPG levels (r=0.247 and 0.241, all P=0.000), negative correlation with leptin and TGF-β1 levels (r=- 0.234 to - 0.319, all P=0.000), and no correlation with TGF-β2 levels. Multiple linear regression stepwise analysis revealed the following results. In premenopausal females, 2.0% and 1.5% of the changes in LH could be explained by OPG and leptin, respectively, while 1.9% of the changes in OPG could be explained by LH. In perimenopausal females, the determinants of OPG and TGF-β1 on FSH were 10.9% and 17.0%, respectively, and the determinants of OPG, TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 on LH were 4.5%, 4.9% and 16.4%, respectively. The determinants of FSH and LH on OPG were 14.5% and 2.5%, respectively. The determinant of FSH on TGF-β1 was 4.5%, while the determinant of LH on TGF-β2 was 16.4%. In postmenopausal females, the determinants of leptin and OPG on FSH were 10.2% and 2.8%, respectively, and the determinants of OPG and TGF-β1 on LH were 5.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The determinant of FSH on OPG, leptin and TGF-β1 were 6.1%, 3.4% and 9.2%. Conclusions: These results indicate that age-related gonadotropic hormone levels are associated with changes in OPG, TGF-β1, TGF-β2 and leptin, and change with menopausal status. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77954338033	Relationships between serum adiponectin, apelin, leptin, resistin, visfatin levels and bone mineral density, and bone biochemical markers in post-menopausal Chinese women	Background: Adiponectin, apelin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin, as the main circulating peptides secreted by adipose tissue, are potential contributors to bone metabolism. However, their association with bone mineral density (BMD) is unclear. Aim: The present study investigated whether these serum adipocytokines levels are associated with BMD and bone turnover markers. Methods: Serum adiponectin, apelin, leptin, resistin, visfatin levels, bone turnover biochemical markers, and BMD were determined in 336 post-menopausal Chinese women (41-81 yr old). Results: Adiponectin was negatively correlated with fat mass, while leptin had a positive correlation. In the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, years since menopause, lean mass, estradiol, and adiponectin, but not fat mass, apelin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin, were independent predictors of BMD. The significant positive correlations between adiponectin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen were found. Conclusions: Adiponectin was an independent predictor of BMD in post-menopausal Chinese women, and positively correlated with bone turnover biochemical markers. It suggested that adiponectin may exert a negative effect on bone mass by promoting excessive bone resorption associated with bone loss in post-menopausal women. ©2010, Editrice Kurtis.

84876743029	MiR-148a regulates osteoclastogenesis by targeting V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in bone metabolism. In the present study, we found that miR-148a is dramatically upregulated during osteoclastic differentiation of circulating CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Overexpression of miR-148a in CD14+ PBMCs promoted osteoclastogenesis, whereas inhibition of miR-148a attenuated osteoclastogenesis. V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (MAFB) is a transcription factor negatively regulating RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. miR-148a directly targeted MAFB mRNA by binding to the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) and repressed MAFB protein expression. In vivo, our study showed that silencing of miR-148a using a specific antagomir-inhibited bone resorption and increased bone mass in mice receiving ovariectomy (OVX) and in sham-operated control mice. Furthermore, our results showed that miR-148a levels significantly increased in CD14+ PBMCs from lupus patients and resulted in enhanced osteoclastogenesis, which contributed to the lower bone mineral density (BMD) in lupus patients compared with normal controls. Thus, our study provides a new insight into the roles of miRNAs in osteoclastogenesis, and contributes to a new therapeutic pathway for osteoporosis. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

44949216002	Recombinant tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor-3 protein induces apoptosis of murine osteoblast MC3T3-E1	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) plays an essential role in the regulation of bone metabolism. Here we report that recombinant tissue metalloproteinase inhibitor-3 (TIMP-3) protein induces the apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. Cell apoptosis was detected by sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay. Fas and Fasl protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. The enzyme substrate was used to assess the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. The phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and ERK1/2 was examined by Western blot analysis. The ELISA suggested that TIMP-3 promoted MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis. TIMP-3 treatment induced the expression of Fas and Fasl proteins, and the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. TIMP-3 treatment induced p38 and ERK phosphorylation. SB203580 and PD98059, the inhibitor of p38 and ERK, respectively, abolished the TIMP-3 effect on osteoblast apoptosis. In conclusion, the signal pathway through which TIMP-3 induces MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis, mediated by Fas and involves the p38 and ERK signal transduction pathways. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

48749108517	Effect of adiponectin on the expression of nuclear factor kappa B ligand receptor activator in human osteoblasts	Background: The main effect of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κ B ligand (RANKL) excreted by osteoblasts is to maintain the differentiation and activity of osteoclasts and to inhibit apoptosis of osteoclasts. Objective: To observe the effect of adiponectin on the RANKL expression in osteoblasts and to approach the action of adiponectin on the osteoclastogenesis. Design, Time and Setting: Single sample observation, the experiment was performed at the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between August 2005 and March 2006. Materials: The 5 cancellous bone samples of normal adult (35-55 years old) anterior superior iliac spine were discarded in surgery and offered by donor voluntarily. Reconstituted human adiponectin was purchased from Calbiochem. Methods: We cultured osteoblasts using cancellous bone samples of normal adult anterior superior iliac spine in vitro. Human osteoblasts were incubated with different doses of adiponectin (0,3,10 and 30 mg/L) for 48 hours. Osteoblasts and CD14+peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs) were co-cultured for 14 days, and intervened by 30 mg/L adiponectin for 14 days, then intervened by 25 μ g/L M-SCF+ 50 μ g/L RANKL for 14 days. The co-cultured cells were used as positive controls for osteoclasts induction. Main Outcome Measures: We determined the expression of RANKL by FQ-PCR and ELISA, intervened osteoblasts and PBMCs co-culture system by adiponcetin and observed its effect on the osteoclastogenesis. Results: Adiponectin promoted human osteoblast RANKL expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Adiponectin induced sPANKL production in a dose- and time-dependent manner in osteoblasts. Adiponectin induced the osteoclast formation in the co-culture systems of osteoblasts and PBMCs. Conclusion: These findings show that adiponectin incduces osteoclast formation via stimulating RANKL production in osteoblasts.

49749141050	L-Carnitine protects against apoptosis of murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells	L-Carnitine (LC), an amino acid with a major role in cellular energy metabolism, has positive effects on bone metabolism. However, the effect of LC on apoptosis of osteoblast in vitro has not been reported. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of LC on apoptosis of mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1. Cell apoptosis was measured by sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and Bcl-2, Bax protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. The enzyme substrate was used to assess the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. LC inhibited MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. Our study also shows that LC decreased cytochrome c release and caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, LC protected against MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis induced by the glucocorticoid (GC) dexamethasone (Dex). © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

50249163652	Adiponectin regulates the expression of osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand in human osteoblast	Objective: To investigate the possible mechanism by which adiponectin influences the osteoclastogenesis. Methods: Human osteoblasts were cultured in vitro and adiponectin of the concentrations 0, 3, 10, and 30 μg/ml were added for 48 hours to investigate the dose-dependent effect on the mRNA and protein expression of osteoprotegerin (OPG) in osteoblasts, and adiponectin of the concentrations 0 or 30 μg/ml was added for 0-48 hours to investigate the time-dependent effect. Fluorescent quantitation PCR and ELISA were used to detect the expression of OPG and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). Other human osteoblasts were cultured with CD14 + peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and incubated together with adiponectin of the concentration of 30 μg/ml for 14 days, and then stained by antitartaric acid phosphatase, a marker enzyme of osteoclast. Results: The expression levels of mRNA and protein of OPG in osteoblasts were 100% ± 9%, 68% ± 7%, 47% ± 8%, and 30% ± 5%, and (9.2 ± 0.3), (6.6 ± 0.4), (4.1 ± 0.4), and (2.6 ± 0.4) ng/ml respectively after incubation with adiponectin of the concentrations of 0, 3, 10, and 30 μg/ml for 48 hours. The mRNA and protein expression levels of RANKL were 100% ± 5% 165% ± 8%, 213% ± 6%, and 316% ± 10%, and (1.3 ± 0.2), (2.1 ± 0.1), (2.3 ± 0.2),and (2.8 ± 0.1) ng/ml respectively. Adiponectin inhibited the osteoblast OPG expression and promoted the osteoblast RANKL expression dose- and time-dependently (P < 0.05). Adiponectin induced the osteoclast formation in the coculture systems of osteoblast and PBMCs systems. Conclusion: Adiponectin increases osteoclast formation via stimulating RANKL and inhibiting OPG production in the osteoblasts, which may be one of the mechanisms adiponectin influences the osteoclastogenesis thereby.

Objective: To observe the effects of parathyroid hormone on the expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 in human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. Design, time and setting: Contrast observation was conducted at the laboratory of Institute of Endocrinology & Metabolism, the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between March 2001 and July 2002. Materials: Human osteoblast-like MG-63 cell line; parathyroid hormone (1-34). Methods: MG-63 cells were treated with 1, 10, 100 nmol/L parathyroid hormone (1-34) for 24 hours, respectively, or were treated with 10 nmol/ L parathyroid hormone (1-34) for 2, 6, 24, 48 hours, respectively. Each intervention group had three parallel samples and each intervention was repeated for three times. Main outcome measures: Northern Blotting were used to determine the expression level of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 mRNA; Western Blotting were performed to detect the protein expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1. Results: Our study showed that 1, 10, 100 nmol/L parathyroid hormone (1-34) inhibited membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner in MG-63 cells (P < 0.05). Within 2-48 hours of intervention, 10 nmol/L parathyroid hormone (1-34) inhibited membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 mRNA and protein expression in a time-dependent manner in MG-63 cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Parathyroid hormone can inhibit the expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 in osteoblast-like MG-63 cells, it maybe one of the ways with which parathyroid hormone induces bone resorption.

58149214348	Effect of progesterone on apoptosis of murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells	Progesterone (P) has been suggested as a bone-trophic hormone. Previous studies have shown that P promoted bone formation by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts. But, the effect of P on apoptosis of osteoblast in vitro has not been reported. We propose that P may promote bone formation by suppressing the apoptosis of osteoblast. The present study was performed to investigate the effect of P on apoptosis of murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. Cell apoptosis was measured by acidine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay. Progesterone receptor (PR), cytochrome c, caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. The enzyme substrate was also used to assess the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Progesterone suppressed MC3T3-E1 cells apoptosis induced by serum deprivation, and this effect was blocked by a PR antagonist RU486. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of P on cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in serum-deprived MC3T3-E1 cells were also reversed by RU486. Our study demonstrated that P protects osteoblast against apoptosis through PR and the downstream mitochondrial pathway. Thus, the data suggest that the effects of P on osteoblast apoptosis may contribute to the mechanisms by which P exerts its action on bone formation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

58149263729	Establishment of BMD reference databases for the diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis in central southern Chinese men	Osteoporosis in men is an increasingly important public health problem. This study was designed to establish bone mineral density (BMD) reference databases for central southern Chinese men at multiple skeletal sites. We recruited 2433 native Chinese males for BMD assessment. Of these, 1537 were healthy volunteers (age range, 15-85 years), and 896 were suspected to have osteoporosis. BMD values were measured at the posteroanterior (PA) and lateral spine, hip, and distal forearm using a Delphi A absorptiometer. The quadratic regression model provided the best fit for age-related changes in BMD in the spine and hip. The cubic regression model was the best for describing age-related BMD changes in the distal forearm. Peak BMD in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip occurred at 15-19 years. Peak BMD at the distal forearm occurred at 40-44 years. The prevalence of primary osteoporosis in subjects ranging from 50-85 years was 4.3%-27.7% at various skeletal sites. Compared to the databases established here, the Hologic databases led to significantly higher osteoporosis detection rates. The BMD reference databases established for central southern Chinese men provide the most reliable diagnostic standards for osteoporosis detection in men of central south China. © 2008 Springer.

We investigated the relationship of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 concentrations with those of OPG and leptin in Chinese females. Methods: The serum concentrations of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, OPG, and leptin were measured by ELISA in 459 healthy Chinese females aged 25-80 y. Results: The mean values (± SD) of the serum concentrations of TGF-β1, TGF-β2, OPG, and leptin in Chinese females were 29.7 ± 1.69 μg/l, 13.7 ± 3.86 μg/l, 3.81 ± 1.96 pmol/l, and 10.5 ± 2.01 μg/l, respectively. Further, the serum TGF-β1 concentrations of postmenopausal women were significantly lower than those of perimenopausal and premenopausal women (24.3 ± 1.59 vs 33.4 ± 1.69 and 37.6 ± 1.64, respectively), while the TGF-β2 concentrations of postmenopausal women were significantly higher than those of perimenopausal and premenopausal women (14.6 ± 3.91 vs 13.5 ± 3.93 and 11.7 ± 2.68, respectively). The serum TGF-β1 concentration was found to be significantly negatively correlated with age (r = - 0.335, P = 0.000) and the TGF-β2 concentration, to be significantly positively correlated with age (r = 0.230, P = 0.000). The TGF-β1 concentration was found to be significantly negatively correlated with both TGF-β2 (r = - 0.261, P = 0.000) and OPG (r = - 0.313, P = 0.000) concentrations; a significantly positive correlation was found between the TGF-β1 and leptin concentrations (r = 0.164, P = 0.000) and between TGF-β2 and OPG concentrations (r = 0.432, P = 0.000). Conclusion: These results provide age-related reference values of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 in Chinese adult women, and reveal the relationships between these cytokines. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

72849121740	A novel microRNA targeting HDAC5 regulates osteoblast differentiation in mice and contributes to primary osteoporosis in humans	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) interfere with translation of specific target mRNAs and are thought to thereby regulate many cellular processes. Recent studies have suggested that miRNAs might play a role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Here, we identify a new miRNA (miR-2861) in primary mouse osteoblasts that promotes osteoblast differentiation by repressing histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) expression at the posttranscriptional level. miR-2861 was found to be transcribed in ST2 stromal cells during bone morphogenetic protein 2-induced (BMP2-induced) osteogenesis, and overexpression of miR-2861 enhanced BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis, whereas inhibition of miR-2861 expression attenuated it. HDAC5, an enhancer of runtrelated transcription factor 2 (Runx2) degradation, was confirmed to be a target of miR-2861. In vivo silencing of miR-2861 in mice reduced Runx2 protein expression, inhibited bone formation, and decreased bone mass. Importantly, miR-2861 was found to be conserved in humans, and a homozygous mutation in pre-miR-2861 that blocked expression of miR-2861 was shown to cause primary osteoporosis in 2 related adolescents. Consistent with the mouse data, HDAC5 levels were increased and Runx2 levels decreased in bone samples from the 2 affected individuals. Thus, our studies show that miR-2861 plays an important physiological role in osteoblast differentiation and contributes to osteoporosis via its effect on osteoblasts.

73349090914	Concentration of serum leptin and age in Chinese women and comparison with other races	Objective To determine the relationship between concentration of serum leptin and age in females, and to establish the reference value and compare it with other races. Methods Serum leptin concentration of 690 adult healthy women (aged 20 ∼ 81 years) was measured with ELISA. Results The serum leptin concentration increased with age (r =0. 224, P < 0. 001), and cubic regression was the best-fitting model. Leptin concentration had significant positive correlation with weight (r = 0.574) and body mass index (r = 0.618). The geometric mean of leptin concentration in normal weight, overweight and obesity was (8. 94 ± 1.82), (17.6 ± 1.89), and (34.7 ± 1.69) μg/L, respectively, with significant difference among the 3 groups (P < 0.001). Leptin in pre-men-opause, peri - menopause and post-menopause women was (9.68 ± 1.81), (11.7 ± 1. 89), and (11.4 ± 2.21) μg/L, respectively. The reference value of serum leptin in normal weight females was 5. 30 ∼ 12. 6 μg/L. The curve-fitting of leptin with age in this group was significantly lower than American non Hispanic White (NHW), non Hispanic Black (NHB), and American Mexican (AM) females. Conclusion This study provides reliable reference value of serum leptin in adult women and discovers ethnic difference with American NHW, NHB, and AM females.

7544245302	Stimulation of RANKL and inhibition of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 expression by parathyroid hormone in normal human osteoblasts	Receptor activator of NF-κ (RANK) ligand (RANKL), expressed by cells of the osteoblast lineage binds to RANK, induces signaling and a gene expression cascade that leads to osteoclast differentiation and activation. Recently, osteoblast-derived membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases-1 (MT1-MMP) have been implicated in the process of bone resorption by degrading bone matrix. In the present study, we investigated the effects of parathyroid hormone [PTH (1-34)] on RANKL and MTl-MMP production in cultured normal human osteoblast-like cells (hOB). In reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies, we observed that PTH (1-34) induced RANKL messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression. Activity assays demonstrated that PTH (1-34) simultaneously inhibited MT1-MMP protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The effect of PTH (1-34) on MT1-MMP production was parallel to that on RANKL expression, suggesting a tight inverse relationship between MT1-MMP and RANKL expression. Our findings indicated that the decreased MT1-MMP expression by PTH may be involved in RANKL signaling in osteoblasts and activation of osteoclasts.

76549135685	Age-related changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover and gonadotropin levels and their relationship among Chinese adult women	The relationship between the levels of gonadotropic hormones and bone metabolism in Chinese adult women is unclear. Our research shows that a significant positive correlation exists between the levels of gonadotropic hormones and various bone turnover indicators. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has been found to have a greater influence on all types of bone turnover indicator than luteinizing hormone (LH). Further, FSH has a greater influence on bone formation indicators than on bone resorption indicators. Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum FSH and LH and biochemical markers of bone turnover in native Chinese adult women. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 694 healthy Chinese women aged between 20 and 82 years. Serum FSH, LH, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), osteocalcin (OC), N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen, urinary NTX, urinary CTX, and urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPD) were determined. Results: All types of bone turnover indicator were significantly positively correlated with FSH (r=0.164-0.626, all P=0.000) and LH (r=0.130-0.618, all P=0.013-0.000). The correlation coefficient between serum FSH and BAP was the highest (r=0.626), and that between serum FSH and uDPD was the lowest (r=0.164). The serum gonadotropic hormone levels were higher; concentrations of bone turnover indicators were higher. The extent of the influence of FSH on various bone turnover indicators was approximately seven to 20 times greater than that of LH on these indicators. FSH could explain 43% and 22% of the changes in BAP and OC, respectively; whereas, LH could explain only 2.1% and 1.1%, respectively. FSH could explain approximately 1.9-11.8% of the changes in bone resorption indicators; however, LH had almost no effect on them. Conclusions: Gonadotropic hormone levels are correlated with the rate of bone turnover in Chinese women: the higher the serum gonadotropic hormone levels in circulation, the higher the levels of bone turnover indicators. FSH has a greater influence on all types of bone turnover indicator than LH; moreover, it has a greater influence on bone formation indicators than on bone resorption indicators. © 2009 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.

77950461766	Relationships between serum adiponectin, leptin concentrations and bone mineral density, and bone biochemical markers in Chinese women	Background: Adiponectin and leptin, as the main circulating peptides secreted by adipose tissue, are potential contributors to bone metabolism. However, their association with bone mineral density (BMD) is unknown. We investigated whether these serum adipocytokines concentrations are associated with BMD and bone turnover markers. Methods: Serum adiponectin, leptin concentrations, bone turnover biochemical markers, and BMD were determined in 265 premenopausal and 336 postmenopausal Chinese women. Results: In postmenopausal Chinese women, the multiple linear stepwise regression analysis showed that year since menopause, lean mass, estradiol, and adiponectin, but not fat mass, leptin, were independent predictors of BMD in postmenopausal Chinese women. However, in premenopausal Chinese women, adiponectin was not the predictor of BMD. The significant positive correlations between adiponectin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX) were found only in postmenopausal women. Serum BAP, and NTX, but not adiponectin, decreased in response to alendronate therapy. Conclusions: Adiponectin was an independent predictor of BMD, and positively correlated with bone turnover biochemical markers in postmenopausal Chinese women, but not premenopausal women. It suggested that adiponectin may exert a negative effect on bone mass by promoting excessive bone resorption associated with bone loss. However, these effects may be mediated by menopausal status. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77951666601	Connective tissue growth factor is a downstream mediator for preptin-induced proliferation and differentiation in human osteoblasts	Preptin, a newly isolated 34-amino-acid peptide hormone that is cosecreted with insulin and amylin from pancreatic beta-cells, has emerged as a regulatory element in bone metabolism, but its mechanism remains unclear. We assessed the effects of preptin on proliferation and differentiation of human osteoblasts and investigated the mechanism involved. Our results demonstrated that preptin promoted human osteoblasts proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity. Suppression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which was upregulated by preptin in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the preptin-induced human osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation. Preptin induced activation of ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not p38 or JNK in human osteoblasts. Furthermore, pretreatment of human osteoblasts with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the preptin-induced CTGF secretion and blocked the promoting effect of preptin on osteoblasts proliferation and differentiation. These data demonstrated that preptin is involved in bone anabolism mediated by ERK/CTGF in human osteoblasts and may contribute to the preservation of bone mass observed in hyperinsulinemic states, such as obesity. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77951667583	Suppressive effect of dexamethasone on TIMP-1 production involves murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell apoptosis	High dose glucocorticoid (GC) treatment induces osteoporosis partly via increasing osteoblast apoptosis. However, the mechanism of GC-induced apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. Osteoblast-derived tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) was recently reported to be involved in bone metabolism. Our previous study demonstrated that TIMP-1 suppressed apoptosis of the mouse bone marrow stromal cell line MBA-1 (pre-osteoblast) induced by serum deprivation. Therefore, we tested the effect of the GC dexamethasone (Dex) on TIMP-1 production in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and further determined whether this action is associated with Dex-induced osteoblast apoptosis. Dex decreased TIMP-1 production in MC3T3-E1 cells, and this effect was blocked by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, RU486 and RU40555. Recombinant TIMP-1 protein reduced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis induced by Dex in MC3T3-E1 cells. In addition, the pro-apoptotic effect of the Dex was augmented by suppression of TIMP-1 with siRNA. Furthermore, mutant TIMP-1, which has no inhibitory effects on MMPs, yet protects MC3T3-E1 cells against Dex-induced apoptosis. Our study demonstrates that Dex suppresses TIMP-1 production in osteoblasts through GR, and this effect is associated with its induction of osteoblast apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic action of TIMP-1 is independent of its inhibitory effects on MMPs activities. The decrease in TIMP-1 production caused by Dex may contribute to the mechanisms of Dex-induced bone loss. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77955626424	Insulin receptor substrate 1 regulates the cellular differentiation and the matrix metallopeptidase expression of preosteoblastic cells	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) is an essential molecule for the intracellular signaling of IGF1 and insulin, which are potent anabolic regulators of bone metabolism. Osteoblastic IRS1 is essential for maintaining bone turnover; however, the mechanism underlying this regulation remains unclear. To clarify the role of IRS1 in bone metabolism, we employed RNA interference to inhibit IRS1 gene expression and observed the effects of silencing this gene on the proliferation and differentiation of and the expression of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP) and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11b (TNFRSF11B) in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our results showed that IRS1 short hairpin RNAs can effectively suppress the expression of IRS1, and inhibit the phosphorylation of AKT in IRS1 pathway; reduce the expression of MMP2, MMP3, MMP13, and MMP14, decrease the expression of TNFRSF11B and RANKL (also known as tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11), however increase the RANKL/TNFRSF11B ratio; decrease cell survival, proliferation, and mineralization, and impair the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The downregulation of IRS1 had no effect on the expression of MMP1. Our findings suggest that IRS1 not only promotes bone formation and mineralization but also might play roles in bone resorption partly via the regulation of MMPs and RANKL/TNFRSF11B ratio, thus regulates the bone turnover. © 2010 Society for Endocrinology.

77957026570	Targeting miRNAs in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation	Importance of the field: Bone tissue arises from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiated into the osteoblast lineage by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Emerging evidence indicates that the class of small non-coding single-stranded RNAs known as "microRNAs (miRNAs)" also plays a critical role in this process. Areas covered in this review: In this short review, we summarize the biology and functional mechanisms of miRNAs. Importantly, we discuss miRNA expression, miRNA function, miRNA target prediction, miRNA overexpression and inhibition methods applied in osteoblastogenesis. What the reader will gain: We discuss the potential therapeutic opportunities and challenges for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases by using miRNAs as a therapeutic target. Take home message: Although various microRNAs regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, only a few miRNAs has been reported so far to play a key role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.

79851476085	Relationship of body composition with prevalence of osteoporosis in central south Chinese postmenopausal women	Objectives To elucidate the relationship between body composition and bone mineral density (BMD) and the prevalence of osteoporosis in central south Chinese postmenopausal women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 954 healthy central southern Chinese postmenopausal women, aged 50-82. Total body, lumbar spine and left femur BMD and total body soft tissue composition were measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Results Among the study population, 578 (60·5%) subjects were without osteoporosis and 376 (39·4%) subjects were osteoporotic. The osteoporotic women were older, shorter and thinner, had an earlier age at menopause, a lower BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) of the total body and at different sites, and had lower body mass and body mass components than the women without osteoporosis. Both fat mass and lean mass were positively correlated with age at menopause, height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and BMD at all sites. Fat mass and lean mass were also inversely correlated with age and years since menopause (P < 0·05). After controlling for age, age at menopause and height, both fat mass and lean mass were positively correlated with BMD at the lumbar

79953327693	A Runx2/miR-3960/miR-2861 regulatory feedback loop during mouse osteoblast differentiation	Our recent study showed that miR-2861 promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting histone deacetylase 5, resulting in increased runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) protein production. Here we identified another new microRNA (miRNA) (miR-3960) that played a regulatory role in osteoblast differentiation through a regulatory feedback loop with miR-2861. miR-3960 and miR-2861 were found clustered at the same loci. miR-3960 was transcribed during bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced osteogenesis of ST2 stromal cells. Overexpression of miR-3960 promoted BMP2-induced osteoblastogenesis. However, the inhibition of miR-3960 expression attenuated the osteoblastogenesis. Homeobox A2 (Hoxa2), a repressor of Runx2 expression, was confirmed to be a target of miR-3960. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that Runx2 bound to the promoter of the miR-3960/miR-2861 cluster. Furthermore, overexpression of Runx2 induced miR-3960/miR-2861 transcription, and block of Runx2 expression attenuated BMP2-induced miR-3960/miR-2861 transcription. Here we report that miR-3960 and miR-2861, transcribed together from the same miRNA polycistron, both function in osteoblast differentiation through a novel Runx2/miR-3960/miR-2861 regulatory feedback loop. Our findings provide new insights into the roles of miRNAs in osteoblast differentiation. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84862487811	miR-93/Sp7 function loop mediates osteoblast mineralization	microRNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in osteoblast differentiation. However, the mechanisms of miRNAs regulating osteoblast mineralization still need further investigation. Here, we performed miRNA profiling and identified that miR-93 was the most significantly downregulated miRNA during osteoblast mineralization. Overexpression of miR-93 in cultured primary mouse osteoblasts attenuated osteoblast mineralization. Expression of the Sp7 transcription factor 7 (Sp7, Osterix), a zinc finger transcription factor and critical regulator of osteoblast mineralization, was found to be inversely correlated with miR-93. Then Sp7 was confirmed to be a target of miR-93. Overexpression of miR-93 in cultured osteoblasts reduced Sp7 protein expression without affecting its mRNA level. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-93 directly targeted Sp7 by specifically binding to the target coding sequence region (CDS) of Sp7. Experiments such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and promoter luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Sp7 bound to the promoter of miR-93. Furthermore, overexpression of Sp7 reduced miR-93 transcription, whereas blocking the expression of Sp7 promoted miR-93 transcription. Our study showed that miR-93 was an important regulator in osteoblast mineralization and miR-93 carried out its function through a novel miR-93/Sp7 regulatory feedback loop. Our findings provide new insights into the roles of miRNAs in osteoblast mineralization. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

84863624620	Omentin-1 exerts bone-sparing effect in ovariectomized mice	Summary Omentin-1 inhibited osteoblast differentiation in vitro. In co-culture systems of osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors, omentin-1 reduced osteoclast formation by stimulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) and inhibiting receptor activator for nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL) production in osteoblasts. In vivo, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of omentin-1 suppressed bone turnover and restored bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength in ovariectomized mice. Introduction Omentin-1 (also intelectin-1) is a recently identified visceral adipose tissue-derived cytokine that is highly abundant in plasma. This study was undertaken to investigate the effects of omentin-1 on bone metabolism. Methods Osteoblast differentiation was assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin production and matrix mineralization. OPG and RANKL protein expression and secretion in osteoblasts were detected by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. The effect of recombinant omentin-1 on osteoclast formation was examined in co-culture systems of osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors. The effects of intravenous administration of adenoviral-delivered omentin-1 on bone mass, bone strength, and bone turnover were also examined in ovariectomized mice. Results In vitro, omentin-1 inhibited osteoblast differentiation, while it had no direct effect on osteoclast differentiation; it also reduced osteoclast formation in the co-culture systems through stimulating OPG and inhibiting RANKL production in osteoblasts. In vivo, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of omentin-1 partially restored BMD and bone strength in ovariectomized mice, accompanied by decreased levels of plasma osteocalcin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b and lower serum RANKL/OPG ratios. Conclusion The present study suggests that omentin-1 ameliorates bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency via downregulating the RANKL/OPG ratio. © The Author(s) 2011.

This cross-sectional study was performed on 465 healthy native Chinese women aged 35-80 years. Serum levels of OPG, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 were determined. BDR was measured by DXA at the posteroanterior spine, hip, and distal forearm. At all skeletal sites tested, there was a negative correlation between BDR and serum levels of both OPG (r=-0.122 to -0.230, all P = 0.007-0.000) and TGF-β2 (r=-0.100 to -0.173, all P = 0.029-0.000) and a positive correlation between BDR and serum TGF-β1 (r=0.245-0.365, all P=0.000). After adjustment for age and BMI, there were no statistically significant correlations between serum levels of OPG or TGF-β2 and BDR. However, statistically significant correlations between serum TGF-β1 and BDR at the lumbar spine and ultradistal forearm remained. Multiple linear regression stepwise analysis showed that serum OPG could explain 1.4-3.7% of BDR variation. Serum TGF-β1 was a positive determinant of BDR and could explain 5.3-13.3% of BDR variation. © 2013 Xi-Yu Wu et al.

84878187230	Relationship between serum TGF-β1, OPG levels and osteoporotic risk in native chinese women	Background: Cytokines including transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are closely related to bone metabolism. However, the relationships between TGF-β1, OPG and risk of osteoporosis in native Chinese women are unknown. Our research indicated that there is a positive correlation between TGF-β1 and bone mineral density (BMD) T-score, and a negative correlation between OPG and T-score. The risk of osteoporosis is reduced as TGF-β1 increases and increases as OPG was raised. We investigated correlations of BMD T-scores with circulating TGF-β1 and BMD T-scores with circulating OPG in healthy native Chinese women, and to study the effects of changes in TGF-β1 and OPG on osteoporosis. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 691 healthy native Chinese women aged 20-80. years. Concentrations of serum TGF-β1 and OPG were determined. BMD T-scores at the posteroanterior spine, left hip, and forearm were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: There were positive correlations between serum TGF-β1 and T-scores at the various skeletal sites (r=. 0.167-0.285, all P=. 0.000) and negative correlations between serum OPG and T-scores (r=. - 0.179 to - 0.270, all P=. 0.007-0.000). After adjusting for age and BMI, correlations between TGF-β1 and T-score at the lumbar vertebrae and ultradistal forearm, and between OPG and T-score at the ultradistal forearm in premenopausal subjects, remained statistically significant. Multivariate linear stepwise analysis showed that TGF-β1 could explain 1.9-8.3% of T-score variation at each skeletal site. OPG could explain 2.4-4.4% of T-score variation. When TGF-β1 and OPG concentrations were grouped according to quartile intervals, T-score and the prevalence and risk of osteoporosis varied with changes in the cytokines. Conclusions: The risk of osteoporosis in native Chinese women increased as circulating TGF-β1 was reduced and OPG was raised. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements of BA, bone mineral content (BMC), area1 bone density (aBMD) and volumetric bone density (vBMD) at the posteroanterior (PA) lumbar spine (vertebrae L2-L4) followed by a paired PA/lateral spine (L2-L4) were made using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) fan-beam bone densitometer (Hologic QDR 4500A) in 1436 healthy pre-menopausal women aged from 20 to 56-years-old. At the PA and lateral lumbar spine, there was a significant positive correlation between BA and BMC (r=0.762 and 0.762, p=0.000) and aBMD (r=0.370 and 0.352, p=0.000), but not vBMD (r=0.000 and 0.102, p=0.813 and 0.063). When BA at the PA spine changed by one standard deviation (SD), BMC and aBMD correspondingly changed by 12.6% and 4.3% on the basis of their respective means while vBMD indicated no change. When a variation of 1 SD was observed in BA at the lateral spine, BMC, aBMD and vBMD correspondingly changed by 13.8%, 4.4% and 1.73% on the basis of their respective means. Through an intercomparison among large, intermediate and small BA groups, significant differences were found in the means of subject's height, weight, BMC and aBMD at the PA and lateral spine as well as the detection rate of osteoporosis by aBMD (p=0.000). Detection rates of osteoporosis by aBMD at the PA, lateral spine and vBMD in healthy pre-menopausal women aged from 40 years to 56 years were 4.5%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively, in the small BA group; 1.3%, 6.4% and 7.3%, respectively, in the intermediate BA group; and 0, 0 and 5.5%, respectively, in the large BA group. No significant differences were found in the detection rates of osteoporosis by vBMD among the groups. The results of multiple linear regression revealed that the major factors influencing BA of the lumbar spine was height. In healthy pre-menopausal women of the same race and age, the BA size of the lumbar spine would have significant influence upon aBMD and the diagnosis of osteoporosis, i.e. the larger the BA, the greater the aBMD and the lower the osteoporosis detection rate while conversely, the smaller the BA, the smaller the aBMD and the higher the osteoporosis detection rate. Though vBMD does not change with BA sizes of the lumbar spine, it is a sensitive marker for diagnosing osteoporosis.

84892638721	Age-related bone turnover markers and osteoporotic risk in native Chinese women	Background: The rate of bone turnover is closely related to osteoporosis risk. We investigated the correlation between bone turnover markers and BMD at various skeletal sites in healthy native Chinese women, and to study the effect of changes in the levels of bone turnover markers on the risk of osteoporosis. Methods: A cross-section study of 891 healthy Chinese women aged 20-80 years was conducted. The levels of serum osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), serum cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (sNTX), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (sCTX), urinary NTX (uNTX), urinary CTX (uCTX) and total urinary deoxypyridinoline (uDPD) were determined. BMD at the posteroanterior spine and the hip was measured using DXA. Results: Pearson's correlation coefficient found significant negative correlation between bone turnover marker and BMD T-score at different skeletal sites (r = -0.08 to -0.52, all P = 0.038-0.000). After adjustments for age and body mass index, the partial correlation coefficients between the OC, BAP, sNTX, sCTX and uCTX, and the T-scores at various skeletal sites were still significant. After adjustment of height and weight, the correlation coefficients between most BTMs and PA lumbar spine BMD were also significant. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that bone turnover markers were negative determinants of T-scores. BAP and OC accounted for 33.1% and 7.8% of the variations in the T-scores of the PA spine, respectively. Serum OC, BAP, uDPD, and sNTX accounted for 0.4-21.9% of the variations in the femoral neck and total hip T-scores. The bone turnover marker levels were grouped as per quartile intervals, and the T-scores, osteoporosis prevalence and risk were found to markedly and increase with increase in bone turnover marker levels. Conclusions: This study clarified the relationship between bone turnover markers and osteoporosis risk in native Chinese women. Bone turnover marker levels were found to be important determinants of BMD T-scores. Furthermore, osteoporotic risk significantly increased with increase in the levels of bone turnover markers. © 2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84894597022	Reference intervals of bone turnover markers determined by using their curve-fitting valley for adult females in China	The reference values for bone turnover markers (BTMs) have a significant role in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of metabolic bone disease. This study proposes that the peak value of bone mineral density and the trough value for the BTM curve can be used to determine the reference range of BTM. Introduction: The aim of this study is to determine the reference intervals of BTMs for adult females in China with an attempt to reference the peak bone mineral density (BMD) with the corresponding BTM valley. Methods: This study included 546 premenopausal and 394 postmenopausal women. The levels of several BTMs were determined, and the BMD was measured using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: The BTMs of postmenopausal women were 17-96 % higher than premenopausal women. The change of BTM with age presented an optimal goodness-of-fit according to the cubic regression model (R

1042280999	Recombinant matrix metalloproteinase-14 catalytic domain induces apoptosis in human osteoblastic SaOS-2 cells	Our study previously showed that estrogen and progesterone stimulated the production of matrix metalloproteinase-14 [MMP-14, or also named membrane type matrix metalloproteinses-1 (MT1 -MMP)] in osteoblastic cells. MMP-14 was implied to regulate the function of osteoblasts by degrading bone matrix or growth factors, but the mechanism is unclear. Since MMP-14 plays a role primarily through the catalytic domain, and truncated MMP-14 containing the catalytic domain and lacking transmembrane domain can be secreted into medium by cultured cells, our present study was performed to observe the direct effects of recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain on cultured human osteoblastic osteogenic sarcoma (SaOS)-2 cells. Our data showed that recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain activated proMMP-2 secreted into media by SaOS-2 cells, and this process was blocked by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) treatment. Recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain inhibited the adhesion of SaOS-2 cells to immobilized type I collagen or fibronectin in a dose-dependent manner, and these effects on SaOS-2 cells were abolished by EDTA. Recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain induced SaOS-2 cells apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and apoptosis-inducing activity of MMP-14 catalytic domain was blocked if it was treated with EDTA. In conclusion, we revealed that recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain induced SaOS-2 cells apoptosis. We also indirectly showed the activity of MMP-14 catalytic domain to degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) in cultures of SaOS-2 cells through Gelatin Zymograms and adhesion assay. This suggests that since adhesion of cells to ECM serves as a survival mechanism in osteoblasts, the catalytic activity of recombinant MMP-14 catalytic domain on matrix proteins contributes to its apoptosis-inducing activity. © 2003, Editrice Kurtis.

0642336849	Establishment and evaluation of bone mineral density reference databases appropriate for diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis in Chinese women	This study was designed to establish Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Reference Databases for multiple skeletal sites appropriate for the diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis (OP) in Chinese women. We recruited 2702 healthy Chinese women, 5-96 years of age, for BMD assessment. BMD values at multiple skeletal sites including anteroposterior (AP) and lateral (Lat) lumbar spine, hip, and forearm were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a QDR 4500A device; results were analyzed according to age group using eight regression models. BMD Reference Databases (CWD) were established according to the best regression equation and compared with Hologic reference databases for "Oriental Women" (OWD). Results indicated that the cubic regression model was superior to the quadratic, linear, logarithmic, and exponential regression models, etc. for our purpose, with a determinate coefficient (R

10744231997	The effect of low dose nylestriol-levonorgestrel replacement therapy on bone mineral density in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis	Objective. Recently our studies have shown that nylestriol in combination with levonorgestrel prevented bone loss, decreased bone turnover rate and increased the maximal loading of bone without obvious side effects in retinoic acid (RA) induced osteoporotic rats. In addition to the animal experiments, we evaluate the effect of Compound Nylestriol Tablet (CNT) on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Compound Nylestriol Tablet, which contains 0.5 mg of nylestriol (cyclopentylethinyl estriol) and 0.15 mg of levonorgestrel per tablet, was authorized as a new anti-osteoporotic agent for clinical trial in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Methods. One year's clinical observation was performed in 191 eligible patients who were randomly divided into two groups (A and B). In group A, 119 patients were treated for one year with CNT (one tablet per week) and in group B, 72 patients with placebo. Bone mineral density of lumbar antero-posterior spine (L1-L4), lateral spine, total hip and total forearm positions including radius + ulna at the ultra distal areas, mid areas, and one-third areas, were measured before and after treatment. Biochemical parameters and effects of CNT on uterus, and breast were observed. Results. We found that patients treated with CNT had a significant decrease of bone loss in total forearm, including radius + ulna at the ultra distal, mid, and 1/3 areas compared with control subjects (all P < 0.05). An improved BMD tendency could be seen at the lumbar spine. There were no differences in the observed biochemical variables. No side-effects on uterus, or mammary glands were observed. None of the patients had uterine bleeding or vertebral fractures during one year's CNT treatment. Conclusion. These data suggested that CNT is effective, safe and convenient in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis.

0942266062	Parathyroid hormone inhibits the expression of membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) in osteoblast-like MG-63 cells	Parathyroid hormone (PTH) can stimulate bone resorption by increasing the activity and the number of osteoclasts in bone tissue by several mechanisms. Recently, osteoblast-derived membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MT1-MMP) has been implied to play an important role in the process of bone resorption by degrading bone matrix. In the present study, we observed the effects of PTH (1-34) on MT1-MMP production, and the role of the protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways in the regulation of MT1-MMP in cultures of human osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. By Northern blot and Western immunoblot analysis, we found, unexpectedly, that PTH (1-34) inhibited MT1-MMP mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MG-63 cells. The PKA antagonist H-89 blunted PTH (1-34)-mediated decreases in MT1-MMP protein synthesis. Forskolin, a PKA agonist, decreased MT1-MMP expression, which was similar to the action of PTH on MT1-MMP expression, in MG-63 cells. Staurosporine, a PKC inhibitor, also blocked the inhibition by PTH. We suggest that both the PKA and PKC pathways are involved in MT1-MMP downregulation by PTH. Furthermore, we found that PTH (1-34) induced the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MG-63 cells, and this effect of PTH on RANKL mRNA expression was nearly parallel to the effects of MT1-MMP downregulation, implying a correlation between MT1-MMP and RANKL expression. Our findings suggest that the decreased MT1-MMP expression induced by PTH may be involved in RANKL signaling in osteoblasts, and may play a role in the activation of bone resorption.
