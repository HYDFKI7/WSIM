84939889447	Crosstalk between TGF-β1 and CXCR3 signaling during urethral fibrosis	Urethral fibrosis is an important pathological feature of urethral stricture. TGF-β1 and CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) signaling have been reported as the critical pathways involved in the pathology of fibrosis. Here, we collected the urine samples from the patients with recurring urethral stricture, recurring stricture treated by cystostomy, and age- and gender-matched healthy people. ELISA detection revealed that TGF-β1 level was significantly up-regulated for the urethral stricture patients. By contrast, flow cytometry, real-time PCR detection, and immunofluoresecent staining showed that urethral stricture resulted in decreased expression of CXCR3. TGF-β1 treatment could increase cell proliferation and migration ability of urethra fibroblasts, whereas IP-10/CXCR3 signaling showed the opposite effect. Further, we found a crosstalk between TGF-β1 and CXCR3 signaling in the regulation of urethral fibrosis. Thus, pharmacological intervention of TGF-β1 or CXCR3 signaling has a potential as the therapeutic target for the prevention of urethral fibrosis.

84940328294	Tissue engineering technology in urethral reconstruction	BACKGROUND: Many congenital and acquired anomalies can lead to a defect or stenosis of the urinary tract that ultimately need to be rebuilt. Past surgical repair often utilizes skin, oral mucosa or autologous graft, which may lead to many postoperative complications. The development of tissue engineering technology has opened up a new treatment approach for urethral repair and reconstruction. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current development of scaffold materials, cell sources, and the clinical applications of tissue engineering technology in urethral repair and reconstruction. METHODS: A computer-based online search of literatures related to urethral tissue engineering from January 1994 to may 2012 was performed by the first author in PubMed database and Wanfang database using the key words of "tissue engineering, urethra, scaffold materials, stem cells, vascularization" in English and in Chinese. Literatures published in the authorized journals or recently were preferred. A total of 57 literatures were chosen in result analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The main goals underlying the most current research in tissue engineering remain the following: the determination of the optimal scaffold for cell seeding, the best source of stem cells, and the promotion of neovascularization and nerve regeneration into the implant. Studies addressing urethral tissue engineering have demonstrated that acellular scaffolds with or with no seed cells can be used for urethral reconstructions in clinical trials. While continued development and additional innovation are necessary before potential broad applications are realized, there is cautious optimism that tissue engineering technology will play an increasing role in the management of urethral diseases.

84942155682	In vitro preparation and biochemical evaluation of oxygen generative keratin/silk fibroin compound biomaterial	BACKGROUND: Tissue engineering reconstruction materials have gradually entered into so-called intelligent stage, which means that the relevant biological materials will be given more. If biomaterials are capable to release oxygen in vitro and in vivo, the successful rate of the biomaterials in repair of tissue defects can be significantly improved. However, only protein-derived biomaterials have been reported to produce oxygen successfully. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preparation of the oxygen generative keratin/silk fibroin scaffold and to evaluate its physicochemical and biological characters. METHODS: The keratin and silk fibroin solution were extracted from human hair and worm, respectively. Keratin and silk fibroin were blended at a constant rate (60/40) and mixed with various concentrations of calcium peroxide (5%-25%). The optimal concentration of calcium peroxide was confirmed by the oxygen releasing test. The infrared spectroscopy was used to check the structure of proteins in compound materials, and the mechanical test was also used for evaluating their biomechanical properties. The biomaterial was embedded beneath the rabbit back in order to exam its biocompatibility. The smooth muscle cells were seeded onto the oxygen generative scaffold in order to determine its function of supporting cellular growth. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Using extraction and purification technology, human hair keratin and silk fibroin concentration and purity were improved to meet the subsequent experimental requirements. The oxygen releasing test showed that when the optimal concentration of calcium peroxide was 20%, the final biomaterial could generate the oxygen for the longest time (P < 0.05). The mechanical test of oxygen generative films showed similar mechanical characters to those without calcium peroxide, especially in terms of maximum stress and elongation at break (P > 0.05). The infrared spectroscopy examination showed that the structure of proteins kept intact within the final biomaterial. The final biomaterial also demonstrated the good biocompatibility and non-cytotoxcity. And the seeded cells grew better on the oxygen generative scaffold than on the traditional scaffold. With the optimal concentration of calcium peroxide, the keratin/silk fibroin scaffold can release the oxygen constantly in vitro. The physicochemical and biological characteristics of new biomaterials are excellent, which can be suitable for the further tissue engineering research and application.

14944383424	Decreased testicular expression of cAMP response element modulator (CREM) in RAT with varicocele	This study examines the hypothesis that varicocele would impair the testicular expression of cAMP response element modulator (CREM) in experimental rats. Thirty (30) rats were selected at random, of 20 were operated as varicocele's group; of 10 were for sham-operation as controlled group, testes were removed, fixed and stained in three months. Makler Score was adopted to analyze the bore, limitan's thickness, layer number of cell, the degree of cell's maturity and average score in 200 and 100 seminiferous tubulae, respectively. CREM, HSP60 was determinated by hybridization in situ, the differences between two groups were compared. In varicocele group, seminiferous tubule's bore was decreased (101 ± 2.2 vs 146 ± 4.1), limitan became thicker (3.5 ± 0.1 vs 1.9 ± 0.2), cell's layer number was reduced (3.0 ± 0.2 vs 5.5 ± 0.1), cell's maturity turned to disturbance (3.6 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.1), the average score was lower than controlled group (8.5 ± 0.6 vs 16.0 ± 1.2), they had significant differences (P < 0.001). The testicular CREM expression was significantly lower in varicocele group than in controlled one (VG2.0 ± 0.32, SoG3.90 ± 0.32)(P < 0.001), which was located in spermatogenous cell to spermatocyte stage. However, HSP60 expression in VG was higher than in SoG (3.85 ± 0.3 versus 2.1 ± 0.32) with significant differences (P < 0.001), the expression located in spermatid. Varicocele could lead to lower testicular CREM expression and breeding sperm functional lesion. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.

33744515355	An Evaluation of Surgical Approaches for Posterior Urethral Distraction Defects in Boys	Purpose: We present our preliminary experience with operative approaches in the treatment of complex posterior urethral distraction defects in children. Materials and Methods: A total of 24 boys 7 to 14 years old with obliterative complex posterior urethral distraction defects were treated with 1 of 3 surgical approaches between January 1998 and December 2002. A perineal approach was used in 5 cases, a transperineal-inferior pubic approach including distal urethral mobilization, corporeal body separation and inferior pubectomy in 10, and a combined transpubic-perineal approach in 9. Results: Patients were followed 1 to 5 years postoperatively. A successful result of no recurrence of stricture was achieved in 19 of 24 patients (79.2%), including 3 of 5 (60%) treated with a perineal approach, 9 of 10 (90%) with a transperineal-inferior pubic approach and 7 of 9 (77.8%) with a transpubic-perineal approach. Complications included 1 combined false passage, which was resolved using a transperineal-inferior pubic approach, 2 urethrocutaneous fistulas, which were resolved using a perineal approach in 1 and a transpubic-perineal approach in 1, and 3 rectourethral fistulas, which were resolved using a transpubic-perineal approach in 1 and a transperineal-inferior pubic approach in 1. Of the 9 patients treated with the transpubic-perineal approach 3 walked with an abnormal gait postoperatively. Conclusions: The transperineal-inferior pubic approach fully exposes the space behind the pubis, does not damage pelvic stability and yields better results compared to the perineal and transpubic-perineal approaches. We recommend it as first line operative treatment for complex posterior urethral distraction defects in boys. © 2006 American Urological Association.

33845593960	Staged Pendulous-Prostatic Anastomotic Urethroplasty Followed By Reconstruction of the Anterior Urethra: An Effective Treatment for Long-Segment Bulbar and Membranous Urethral Stricture	Objectives: To describe a novel surgical technique for male long-segment urethral stricture after pelvic trauma using the intact and pedicled pendulous urethra to replace the bulbar and membranous urethra, followed by reconstruction of the anterior urethra. Methods: Two patients with long-segment post-traumatic bulbar and membranous urethral strictures with short left pendulous urethras who had undergone several failed previous surgeries were treated with staged pendulous-prostatic anastomotic urethroplasty followed by reconstruction of the anterior urethra. This procedure was divided into three stages. First-stage surgery was mobilization of the anterior urethra down to the coronary sulcus and then rerouted to the prostatic urethra followed by pendulous-prostatic anastomotic urethroplasty with transposition of the penis to the perineum. Second-stage surgery was transecting the anterior urethra at the revascularised coronary sulcus 6 mo later, followed by straightening of the penis and urethroperineostomy. Third-stage surgery was reconstruction of the anterior urethra 6 mo later. Results: Postoperatively, the two patients reported satisfactory voiding. For patient 1, retrograde urethrography showed that the urethra was patent, and that the mean maximal flow rate (MFR) was 18.4 ml/s with no postvoiding residual urine after the third-stage surgery and at 3-yr follow-up. For patient 2, a 22F urethral catheter could pass smoothly through the urethra, and the MFR was 19.5 ml/s with no postvoiding residual urine at 2-yr follow-up. Conclusions: This procedure was an effective surgical option for men with complex long-segment post-traumatic bulbar and membranous urethral strictures, especially for those who had undergone failed previous surgical treatments. © 2006 European Association of Urology.

33750996169	The clinical investigation of the correlation factors in the urethral trauma patients associated with erectile dysfunction	Objective: To investigate the correlation factors in patients suffered from the urethral trauma associated with erectile dysfunction. Methods: 40 patients were tested with IIEF-5, NEVA system and PPUD. Results: The IIEF-5 had the significant differentiation before and after trauma. The scores changing were larger in patients with pubic diasis than without pubic diasis. The same result also appeared in the changing of penile length and circumference between the posterior and anterior urethral trauma. The ratio about the velocity of penile dorsal vein> 5cm/s had the significant differentiation, as well. Those suffered from the anterior urethral trauma had longer erectile duration than the posterior urethral injured patients. Posterior urethral injury was more likely to cause the erectile dysfunction than other. Differentiation were also found in the age between the velocity of penile dorsal vein>5cm/s and <5cm/s. The percent whose velocity of penile dorsal vein>5cm/s in the age of 30 to 40 is higher than others. Conclusion: It is suggested that pubic diasis may be an important correlation factor in patients suffered from urethral trauma with erectile dysfunction. It also contributes to the injured places between anterior and posterior urethra and patients' ages. Psychogenic factor related to the erectile dysfunction too.

33845706247	Immunohistochemical analysis of Omi/HtrA2 expression in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia	The serine protease Omi/HtrA2 is released from mitochondria into the cytosol after apoptotic stimuli, inducing apoptosis in a caspase-independent manner through its protease activity and in a caspase-dependent manner by neutralizing the inhibition of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) on caspases. Alteration of apoptosis is essential for cancer development, and cancer cell death by radiation and chemotherapy is largely dependent upon apoptosis. Thus, analysis of the expression status of Omi/HtrA2, a regulator of apoptosis, in cancer tissues is needed for an understanding of cancer development. In the current study we analyzed the expression of Omi/HtrA2 in 65 prostate cancer, 40 benign prostatic hyperplasia and 10 normal prostate specimens by immunohistochemistry. Omi/HtrA2 mRNA levels of in vivo prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia samples were also assayed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunopositivity (defined as ≥30%) was observed for Omi/HtrA2 in most of the prostate cancers, and the positive rate of Omi/HtrA2 was lower in the well-differentiated group than in the poorly and moderately differentiated groups (p<0.005). By contrast, the cells in the normal prostate and benign prostatic hyperplasia groups showed no or only weak expression of Omi/HtrA2. Meanwhile, the Omi/HtrA2 mRNA level of prostate cancer is much higher than that of benign prostatic hyperplasia (p<0.001). Taken together, these results suggest that prostate cancer cells in vivo may need Omi/HtrA2 expression for apoptosis, and that Omi/HtrA2 expression might be involved in prostate cancer development.

33847151223	Substitution Urethroplasty of Complex and Long-Segment Urethral Strictures: A Rationale for Procedure Selection	Objectives: We evaluated the applications and outcomes of substitution urethroplasty, using a variety of techniques, in 65 patients with complex, long-segment urethral strictures. Methods: From January 1995 to December 2005, 65 patients with complex urethral strictures >8 cm in length underwent substitution urethroplasty. Of the 65 patients, 43 underwent one-stage urethral reconstruction using mucosal grafts (28 colonic mucosal graft, 12 buccal mucosal graft, and 3 bladder mucosal graft), 17 patients underwent one-stage urethroplasty using pedicle flaps, and 5 patients underwent staged Johanson's urethroplasty. Results: The mean follow-up time was 4.8 yr (range; 0.8-10 yr), with an overall success rate of 76.92% (50 of 65 cases). Complications developed in 15 patients (23.08%) and included recurrent stricture in 7 (10.77%), urethrocutaneous fistula in 3 (4.62%), coloabdominal fistula in 1 (1.54%), penile chordee in 2 (3.08%), and urethral pseudodiverticulum in 2 (3.08%). Recurrent strictures and urethral pseudodiverticulum were treated successfully with a subsequent procedure, including repeat urethroplasty in six cases and urethrotomy or dilation in three. Coloabdominal fistula was corrected only by dressing change; five patients await further reconstruction. Conclusions: Penile skin, colonic mucosal, and buccal mucosal grafts are excellent materials for substitution urethroplasty. Colonic mucosal graft urethroplasty is a feasible procedure for complicated urethral strictures involving the entire or multiple portions of the urethra and the technique may also be considered for urethral reconstruction in patients in whom other conventional procedures failed. © 2006 European Association of Urology.

33847354874	Urethral reconstruction with buccal mucosa and colonic mucosa onlay grafts: Experiment with dogs	Objective: To investigate the possibility of urethral reconstruction with free buccal mucosa and colonict mucosa onlay graft. Methods: Twenty male mongrel dogs were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 10 each). In group A: 4 cm × 0.8 cm segement of perineal urethra was excised and onlay urethroplasty was performed using free buccal mucosa. In group B:4 cm × 0.8 cm segement of perineal urethra was excised and onlay urethroplasty was performed using free colonic rnucosa. Retrograde urethrography was done at week 12. Autopsy specimens were calibrated with a 8Fr catheter. Graft length were measured immediately after scarification in all dogs. Histological study of all autopsy specimens was done. Results: Urethral structures were diagnosed by radiology and confirmed by calibration in 1 of the 10 dogs(10%) in group A and 2 of the 10 dogs (20%) in group B. Graft shrinkage was less than 20% for buccal mucosa and colonic mucosa. Histological examination revealed that the buccal mucosa and colonic mucosa survived inside the urethral lumen of all dogs. Plicae surface and unilaminar cylindric epithelium of the buccal mucosa and colonic mucosa were not observed and metaplastic transitional epithelium covered a large proportion of the urethral mucosa in all dogs. Conclusions: Urethral mucosa can be replaced by colonic mucosa as well as buccal mucosa by using onlay urethroplasty.

33847674373	Reduced semen quality in chronic prostatitis patients that induce the release of apoptotic protein Omi/HtrA2 from spermatozoa	The relationship between chronic prostatitis and fertility has been disputed for many years. Several groups have shown infection and autoimmune response against prostate antigens could have a deleterious effect on semen quality and fertility. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that Omi/HtrA2-induced apoptosis in chronic prostatitis could be a mechanism underlying the observed clinical benefit. The Omi/HtrA2 serine protease is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein, which can be released from mitochondria into the cytosol after apoptosis stimuli, inducing apoptosis in caspase-dependent and independent manners. Forty-one patients diagnosed as suffering from chronic prostatitis were included. Healthy normal individuals were included as controls. Human spermatozoa in the semen were purified by Percoll-gradient technique to separate the seminal plasma and other round cells. Measurements for sperm concentration, motility, morphology, proinflammatory cytokines, Omi/HtrA2 mRNA and protein levels in spermatozoa of chronic protatitis patients, were performed accordingly. Significantly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines were detected in seminal plasma from these prostatitis patients. Omi/HtrA2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in prostatitis men than in normal men. This study shows that chronic prostatitis patients present important alterations in their semen quality parameters, Omi/HtrA2 mRNA and protein levels of spermatozoa. We speculate that the inflammatory process involved may affect male fertility by release of proapoptotic protein Omi/HtrA2.

34247354577	Urethral cystoscopic realignment and early end-to-end anastomosis develop different influence on erectile function in patients with ruptured bulbous urethra	The objective of this study is to compare the influence on erectile function between urethral cystoscopic realignment and early end-to-end anastomosis treating ruptured bulbous urethra. 58 cases were selected, 32 had urethral cystoscopic realignment (group I) and 26 cases had urethral end-to-end anastomosis (group II). The parameters of P-CDU (Penile Color Duplex Ultrasound), NPT (Nocturnal Penile Tumescence), and IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) were compared between the two groups 6 months after operation. Group I was higher than group II in IIEF (21 vs 14) with significant differences. With P-CDU we observed an improvement in penile vascularization in group I as confirmed by the detection of an increase in peak systolic velocity (PSV) (26 cm/s vs 16 cm/s, p < .01) and a decrease in end diastolic velocity (EDV) (3 cm/s vs 6 cm/s p < 0.05), resulting in an increase in resistive index (RI) (0.85 vs 0.56, p < 0.05). The parameters of NPT showed a significant increase compared to group II (p < 0.01) in satisfactory erection number (5 vs 1.5), maximum rigidity (80% vs 42%), and total time that the increase in circumference was greater than 30% of baseline during sleep (100 sec vs 30 sec). Urethral cystoscopic realignment treating ruptured bulbous urethra can reduce the incidence of erectile dysfunction [ED]. A long term follow-up should be studied. Copyright © Informa Healthcare.

34247355041	Bulbourethral Composite Suspension for Treatment of Male-Acquired Urinary Incontinence	Objectives: We evaluated the efficacy of bulbourethral composite sling procedure in the treatment of male urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, or prostatic enucleation for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and posterior urethroplasty. Methods: Between May 2000 and April 2005, a bulbourethral composite sling was performed in 26 patients with acquired urinary incontinence. Eight (30.8%) of these patients had severe urinary incontinence, and 18 (69.2%) had mild to moderate urinary incontinence. A polyester patch plus tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) device was used in the procedure. Prolene threads were attached to the two ends of polyester taper then passed from the perineal incision to a suprapubic incision with a TVT needle. The ends of the sutures and TVT were tied over the rectus fascia in the midline after repeated urethral pressure measurements reached 80-90 cm H

37749047068	Purity analysis of rabbit corporal smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro	Objective: To compare and evaluate the purity of corporal smooth muscle cells isolated by different procedures in vitro. Methods: The explant cell culture and digestion cell culture methods were used to isolate corporal smooth muscle cells from young rabbit cavernosal tissue. Velocity sedimentation were used to enrich the cells. Using ́-smooth muscle actin, myosin and vimentin monoclone mouse antibodies as markers, the cells purity in cultured cells was analysed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Results: Using α-smooth muscle actin as the cell marker, the positive rate was 16.91% in the digestion cell culture and 11.13% in the explant cell culture. After velocity sedimentation procedures, the cells purity was increased to 26.88% in the digestion cell culture and 21.98% in the explant cell culture. Immunofluorescence confirmed contaminating fibroblasts by vimentin labeling. Conclusion: It is difficult to exclude fibroblasts contamination in corporal smooth muscle cells cultured in vitro. Velocity sedimentation procedures can only achieve higher purity of corporal smooth muscle cells.

58849122217	Transurethral incision of the bladder neck using KTP in the treatment of bladder neck obstruction in women	Objectives: To study the results and complications of the potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP, green) laser during transurethral incision of the bladder neck in the treatment of female voiding dysfunction due to bladder neck obstruction. Methods: A total of 40 women (43-79 years of age) with obstruction were identified. Patients with neurogenic, traumatic, or iatrogenic causes of obstruction were excluded. Preoperative investigations included a full urodynamic examination and urethrocystoscopy. Transurethral bladder neck incision with KTP was performed in all patients. Urodynamic results, clinical improvements in voiding symptoms, and volume of bleeding were assessed. Results: Of the 40 patients, 12 had chronic urinary retention and 28 had difficult micturition. The most common findings on urodynamic study were a high voiding pressure plus low flow rate and high urethral pressure. After treatment, the lower urinary tract symptoms were resolved or improved in all patients. Urodynamic study revealed decreased voiding pressure, post-void residual urine volume, and increased maximal flow rate. Conclusions: Transurethral incision of the bladder neck is effective in relieving voiding difficulties owing to anatomic or functional bladder neck obstruction in women. KTP has great efficacy in the treatment of female voiding dysfunction due to bladder neck obstruction. Copyright © 2009 S. Karger AG.

79951651129	Biocompatibility and mechanical properties of naturally derived and synthetic scaffolds for urethral reconstruction	BACKGROUND: Recently debates on what kinds of urethral repair and reconstruction of tissue engineering scaffolds are more suitable occurred constantly, its evaluation of biocompatibility and mechanical properties are also poorly reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mechanical properties and biocompatibility applied to urethral repair and reconstruction of a variety of biomaterials. METHODS: Small intestinal submucosa (SIS), bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG), and acellular corpus spongiosum matrix (ACSM) were prepared by decellularization method; polyglycolic acid (PGA) scaffold was prepared by knitting method. Uniaxial tensile mechanical testing was conducted to determine biomechanical properties of each scaffold; the surface pore size of scaffold was determined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity of various biomaterials was detected by MTT assay. Corporal cavernosum smooth muscle cells (CCMSc) were inoculated in all scaffolds, cell permeability was further assessed after 13 days cultured in vitro. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Biomechanical evaluation showed that the detection results of ACSM in terms of elastic modulus and fracture strength was prior to other materials (P < 0.05). MTT assay showed that all the scaffolds were in support of normal cell growth and metabolism without obvious cytotoxicity. PGA showed the largest pore size in the scanning electron microscope (> 200 μm); meanwhile, the ACSM has different pore sizes in urethral (< 5 μm) and corpus cavernosum surfaces (> 10 μm). Widespread distribution of cells could be observed in PGA 14 days after seeding. There was no obvious sign of cell penetration in BAMG and ACSM urethral surfaces. However, significant cell penetration growth performances in cavernosal surfaces of SIS and ACSM were observed. It is indicated that all scaffolds demonstrated good biocompatibility, which is similar to normal urethral tissue in terms of mechanical properties. However, ACSM has certain advantages in many parameters of mechanics and histology.

84867004622	Effects of multiple agents on epithelial differentiation of rabbit adipose-derived stem cells in 3D culture	Mesenchymal stem cells have been given particular attention in tissue regeneration research due to their multipotency and proliferative activity. In this study, we investigated the possibility of epithelial differentiation of rabbit adipose-derived stem cells (rASCs) in an in vitro 3D culture system. The experimental procedure was performed with different contributing factors including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), epidermal growth factor (EGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and hydrocortisone in air-liquid interface culture, for modulating proliferation and providing a synergistic effect on epithelial differentiation of rASCs. After induction, immunofluorescence staining, western blot analysis, flow cytometry analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay have been performed to detect the expression of epithelial-specific markers and mesenchymal marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). The growth pattern and viability of cells were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and Hoechst 33258 assay, respectively. After treated with optimized induction medium (including 2.5 μM ATRA, 20 ng/mL EGF, 10 ng/mL KGF, 10 ng/mL HGF, and 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone), rASCs were observed to display a stratified epithelial-like morphology, with the expression of cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 13 in 63.69%±2.63% and 22.17%±1.51%, respectively, and the relative expression level of cytokeratin 19 increased to 3.152 compared with 0.151 before induction. The expression of α-SMA decreased to 19.40%±1.45% after induction, but almost no expression of involucrin was detected. The results showed that the establishment of an epithelial-specific microenvironment may be a feasible way for epithelial differentiation of ASCs in vitro, and provided an alternative for research on epithelium regeneration. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84876664720	Urethral reconstruction with tissue engineering and RNA interference techniques in rabbits	Objective: To investigate the feasibility of replacing urinary epithelial cells with oral keratinocytes and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)1 siRNA transfected fibroblasts seeded on bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) to reconstruct urethra. Methods: Autologous oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA transfected fibroblasts were seeded onto BAMGs to obtain a tissue-engineered mucosa. The tissue-engineered mucosa was assessed using morphology and scanning electron microscopy. In 27 male rabbits, a ventral urethral mucosal defect was created. Urethroplasty was performed with autogenic oral keratinocyte and TGF-β1 siRNA transfected fibroblast-seeded BAMGs (9 rabbits, group 1), with autogenic oral keratinocyte-seeded BAMGs (9 rabbits, group 2) or with BAMGs with no cell seeding (9 rabbits, group 3). Retrograde urethrography and histological analyses were performed to evaluate the results of urethroplasty. Results: In vitro, oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA transfected fibroblasts had good biocompatibility with BAMGs. In vivo, the urethra kept a wide caliber in groups 1 and 2. Strictures were observed in group 3. Histologically, the retrieved urethra in group 3 showed fibrosis and inflammation during 6 months. Stratified epithelial layer regenerated in group 2, whereas there was no evidence of formation of capillary in the epithelial lower layer during the study period. Stratified epithelial layer and formation of capillary in the epithelial lower layer were evident after 6 months in group 1. Conclusion: Our study suggested that oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA transfected fibroblasts could be used as a source of seed cells for urethral tissue engineering. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84877267418	Preliminary experimental study of urethral reconstruction with tissue engineering and RNA interference techniques	This study investigated the feasibility of replacing urinary epithelial cells with oral keratinocytes and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected fibroblasts seeded on bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) in order to reconstruct tissue-engineered urethra. Constructed siRNAs, which expressed plasmids targeting TGF-β1, were transfected into rabbit fibroblasts. The effective siRNA was screened out by RT-PCR and was transfected into rabbit fibroblasts again. Synthesis of type I collagen in culture medium was measured by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Autologous oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA-transfected fibroblasts were seeded onto BAMGs to obtain a tissue-engineered mucosa. The tissue-engineered mucosa was assessed morphologically and with the help of scanning electron microscopy. The TGF-β1 siRNA decreased the expression of fibroblasts synthesis type I collagen. Oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA-transfected fibroblasts were seeded onto sterilized BAMG to obtain a tissue-engineered mucosa for urethral reconstruction. The compound graft was assessed using scanning electron microscope. Oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA-transfected fibroblasts had a good compatibility with BAMG. The downregulation of fibroblasts synthesis type I collagen expression by constructed siRNA interfering TGF-β1 provided a potential basis for genetic therapy of urethral scar. Oral keratinocytes and TGF-β1 siRNA-transfected fibroblasts had good compatibility with BAMG and the compound graft could be a new choice for urethral reconstruction. © 2013 AJA, SIMM & SJTU.

84897057692	Bladder acellular matrix and its application in bladder augmentation	Over the last few decades, both synthetic and natural materials have been utilized to develop bladder substitutes. Most attempts have not been successful because of mechanical, structural, functional, or biocompatibility problems. Bladder acellular matrix (BAM) is obtained by removing cellular components from donor bladders, leaving a tissue matrix consisting of collagen, elastin, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, and growth factors. Multiple BAM-based studies now suggest that tissue engineering techniques may provide efficacious alternatives to current methods of bladder augmentation. Efforts to optimize BAM-based scaffolds are ongoing and would be greatly assisted by feasible means of improving scaffold properties and interaction with cells and tissues. Future applications of BAM will likely include cell-seeded grafts with the eventual hope of producing "off the shelf" replacement materials for bladder augmentation. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

This paper reports a novel method to prepare multi-layered silk fibroin (SF) tissue engineering scaffolds with well-aligned fibers oriented in different angles by an electrospinning process. The resulted aligned fibers construct the scaffolds with a grill-like structure, large area and improved mechanical properties, which have been demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and tensile test. Biocompatibility analysis proves that the grill-like structure well guides the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of porcine iliac endothelial cells along the aligned SF fibers in different directions.

42549127325	Long-term study of urethral mucosa reconstruction using epidermal cell	Objective: To investigate the transformation of epidermal cells from foreskin to reconstruct engineered anterior urethra with acellular collagen matrix. Methods: Acellular collagen matrices were generated from allogeneic rabbit bladder submucosa. In 12 rabbits, autologous foreskin epidermal cells were isolated, in vitro expanded and seeded (inoculation) onto the tubular acellular collagen matrix. In 12 male rabbits, urethral mucous defect was created and urethroplasty was performed with tubular acellular collagen matrix seeded with epidermal cells (n=12). Urethrography was performed at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. In addition, Urethras grafts were harvested and analyzed grossly and histologically. Results: Urethrography and gross views showed a patency of repaired urethral defect with the maintenance of a wide urethral caliber and without sign of strictures at any time points. Histology showed the graft seeded with epidermal cell had formed single layers structure by 1 month, which demonstrated the characteristic presence of a epidermal cells layer with a normal submucosa structure. At 2, 6 month postoperatively, histology showed multi-layers epidermal cells with vessel abundance in submucosa structure. Evidence margin between graft epidermal cells and epithelium cell lays of hostage were at 6 month postoperatively. Histology showed transitional cell lays with graft urethra and without evidence margin between graft and hostage urethra at 12 month postoperatively. Conclusion: As seed cells, epidermal cells seeded to acellular collagen matrix can reconstruct the urethra defect and transform to transitional cells structure finally.

44249109064	Vascularization in tissue engineering materials for urology	Background: As an important part of tissue engineering, vascularization of compound materials is crucial to the survival of seed cells on scaffolds and the functional recovery of original tissues or organs. Objective: To summarize the current development of vascularization in tissue engineering repair and reconstruction for urology. Retrieval strategy: An online search was conducted in PUBMED database and CNKI database to identify the articles related to vascularization in urology published from July 2002 to October 2007 using the key words of "tissue engineering, vascularization, angiogenesis, omentum, growth factor, endothelial progenitor cell, urethra, bladder, urology" in English or in Chinese. Inclusive criterion: The contents of articles were related to vascularization research in tissue engineering repair and reconstruction for urology. Those repeated studies were excluded. Literature evaluation: Totally 214 related papers were collected, and 82 of them met the criteria, including 31 and 25 papers related to the use of omentum and growth factor in tissue engineering for urology respectively, and other 26 articles related to the use of seed cells for vascularization in urinary system. Thirty representative articles were selected as the references. Data synthesis: At present, the great omentum has been used as a bioreactor. After being wrapped by the omentum, the tissue engineered ureter or bladder can be seen a well vascularized structure. Some researches have also found when acellular matrix is combined with some growth factors, such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, the formation of blood capillary on scaffolds can be promoted. Moreover, various seed cells have been used to construct a substitute material by combining with capillary structure. Not only stem cells but also progenitor cells have been considered as a potential to construct microvascularized tissue engineered organs for urology. Conclusion: It is certain that vascularization research is one of the focal points of tissue engineering for urology. But the related research just can be used in laboratory. Few reports are used in clinical practice of urology. So many unsolved problems need an exploration.

50949127366	Urethral Reconstruction Using Oral Keratinocyte Seeded Bladder Acellular Matrix Grafts	Purpose: We investigated the feasibility of urethral reconstruction using oral keratinocyte seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts. Materials and Methods: Autologous oral keratinocytes were isolated, expanded and seeded onto bladder acellular matrix grafts to obtain a tissue engineered mucosa. The tissue engineered mucosa was assessed using morphology and scanning electron microscopy. In 24 male rabbits a ventral urethral mucosal defect was created. Urethroplasty was performed with autogenic oral keratinocyte seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts in 12 rabbits in the experimental group or with bladder acellular matrix grafts with no cell seeding in 12 in the control group. Retrograde urethrography was performed 1, 2 and 6 months after grafting. The urethral grafts were analyzed grossly and histologically. Results: Oral keratinocytes had good biocompatibility with bladder acellular matrix grafts. Rabbits implanted with oral keratinocyte seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts voided without difficulty. Retrograde urethrography revealed no sign of strictures at 1, 2 and 6 months. In the control group the urethra with repaired defects was accompanied by strictures. Histological examination showed that grafts seeded with oral keratinocytes formed a 1-layer structure by 1 month, and at 2 and 6 months the keratinocytes had formed multiple layers. There was an evident margin between graft oral keratinocytes and host epithelium. The oral keratinocytes at basilar layers of the grafts expressed P63, as shown by immunocytochemistry. In the control group histopathological evaluation revealed that no 1-layer or stratified epithelium cells had developed at the repaired defect sites, whereas an inflammatory reaction was found in 2 rabbits. Conclusions: Oral keratinocytes had good biocompatibility with bladder acellular matrix grafts. Urethral reconstruction with these grafts was better than with bladder acellular matrix grafts alone. © 2008 American Urological Association.

50149119038	Long-term study of male rabbit urethral mucosa reconstruction using epidermal cell	Aim: To investigate the transformation of characteristics of epidermal cells from foreskin which were used to reconstruct male rabbit anterior urethra in combination with acellular collagen matrices. Methods: In three rabbits, autologous foreskin epidermal cells were isolated, expanded in vitro, and seeded (inoculated) onto a tubular acellular collagen matrix, acquired from allogeneic rabbit bladder submucosa. A urethral mucosal defect was created, and urethral reconstruction was performed with the tubular acellular collagen matrix seeded with epidermal cells. Results: On gross examination at 12 months following the procedure, the mucosa of the urethral grafts appeared lubricous and smooth. Urethrography showed that a wide urethral caliber had been maintained without any sign of strictures. Histological examination showed a transitional cell layer in the graft without evidence of a margin between the graft and the host tissue at 12 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Epidermal cells seeded onto acellular collagen matrices can be successfully used to reconstruct urethras that have defects and are transformed to transitional epithelial cells. © 2008, Asian Journal of Andrology, SIMM and SJTU.

54949148746	Ileal ureteric replacement with an ileo-psoas muscle tunnel antirefluxing technique for the treatment of long segment ureteric strictures	OBJECTIVES: To develop and report our initial experience with a novel antirefluxing technique for segmental ileal ureteric replacement for the treatment of long ureteric strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2000 and January 2007, 12 cases of ureteric strictures (nine bilateral and three unilateral) were treated using a novel surgical technique in which the ureter was replaced with a segment of ileum using an end-to-side anastomosis. An antireflux valve was constructed by fixing the distal part of upper ureter (4 cm) between the psoas muscle and ileal segment (the ileo-psoas tunnel technique). The distal ileum was connected to the urinary bladder with an end-to-side anastomosis. RESULTS: The 12 cases were followed-up for a mean (range) of 39.42 (12-64) months. There were no cases of pyelonephritis or signs of renal failure after surgery. There was dramatic improvement in hydronephrosis, as assessed by intravenous urography, in the 4-9 months after surgery. Cystography showed no evidence of ileo-ureteric reflux. Mild hyperchloraemic acidosis was detected in two patients and was successfully treated with oral alkalization. CONCLUSIONS: In our initial experience, ileal ureteric replacement combined with the ileo-psoas tunnel antirefluxing technique is a highly effective procedure for the treatment of ureteric strictures. © 2008 The Authors.

54249099165	Preliminary experimental study of tissue-engineered urethral reconstruction using oral keratinocytes seeded on BAMG	Introduction: This study investigates the feasibility of replacing urinary epithelial cells with oral keratinocytes seeded on a bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) to reconstruct a tissue-engineered urethra. Materials and Methods: After enzymatic treatment of a small segment of rabbit buccal mucosa (1.0 × 0.4 cm), the epidermis and dermis were separated mechanically. Oral keratinocytes were isolated from the epidermis and seeded onto a culture dish with a feeder layer of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts inhibited by mitomycin (i3T3) or on a culture dish without i3T3, respectively. These cells were expanded and applied to sterilized BAMG to obtain a tissue-engineered mucosa. Oral keratinocytes were assessed by growth curve, morphology and immunofluorescence staining. The tissue-engineered mucosa was assessed using morphology, immunohistochemistry staining and scanning electron microscopy. Results: Oral keratinocytes seeded onto a feeder layer of i3T3 had finer morphous and better amplification capability, and could be passaged for 8 generations. Oral keratinocytes that were cultured without i3T3 could only be subcultured 2 generations before ageing. Passage 2 oral keratinocytes cultured with i3T3 were expanded and seeded onto sterilized BAMG to obtain a tissue-engineered mucosa for urethral reconstruction. The compound graft was assessed using HE staining and scanning electron microscopy. Oral keratinocytes had good compatibility with BAMG. Conclusions: Rabbit oral keratinocytes of can be cultured in vitro and attain magnitude in quantity. Oral keratinocytes also had good compatibility with BAMG and the compound graft achieved could become a new choice in urethral reconstruction. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

55949124558	Risk factors for erectile dysfunction in patients with urethral strictures secondary to blunt trauma	Introduction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a well-known consequence of pelvic fracture, particularly in cases involving urethral injury. There are several risk factors that may be related to ED. However, no systemic approach is used to assess erectile function secondary to urethral trauma. Aim. To investigate ED associated with urethral injury secondary to pelvic fracture and perineal trauma. Methods. Forty patients with traumatic urethral strictures secondary to blunt traumatic impact episode to the pelvis or perineum were included in our study. Pelvic fractures and urethral strictures were categorized according to injury types and radiological findings. All patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) monitoring, dynamic color-duplex Doppler ultrasonography (D-CDDU) before surgery. NPT monitoring was conducted again after surgery. Main Outcome Measures. The events of NPT and D-CDDU were recorded. Results. In all patients, 11 had organic ED demonstrated by NPT. Vascular pathology was identified in three of 11 patients (27%). The peak systolic velocity of cavernosal artery was lower in patients with pubic diastasis in comparison to those without diastasis (P<0.05). Significant changes in penile length and circumference were noted in posterior urethral injury compared with anterior urethral injury during erection (P<0.05). The erectile duration time has a similar statistical difference in two groups mentioned above. However, no significant difference could be observed in the end-to-end anatomosis procedure before and after surgery (P>0.05). Conclusions. The pelvic fracture type, especially pubic diastasis, is a risk factor for ED following urethral injury. Location of the stricture is also a risk factor for subsequent erectile dysfunction. © 2008 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

60849091091	Purification of adipose tissues prior to primary culture of stem cells	Background: Adipose tissue-derived stem cells receive a high attention in tissue engineering research. Adipose tissue-derived stem cells lack of specific surface marker, there is no effective purified method. Purified adipose is a simple method to elevate purify of stem cells. Objective. To analyze how to purify adipose tissues before primary culture of adipose tissue-derived stem cells. Design, Time and Setting: The controlled animal experiment was performed at the Shanghai Animal Center of Experimental Medicine of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital between December 2007 and March 2008. Materials: Four-week old Sprague Dawley rats were used for obtaining adipose tissues from the inguinal groove. Methods: Adipose tissues from rat inguinal groove were dissected to educe superficial blood vessel and blood vessel branches. Both blood vessel inside and elliptic nodal tissues surrounding blood vessels were excised. Main Outcome Measures: Stained elliptic nodal tissues stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin were observed with a microscope to make sure what kind of tissues they are. The purified adipose tissues and unpurified adipose tissues were stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin. The differences in their tissue construction were observed using the microscope. Results: Elliptic nodal tissues stained by Hematoxylin-Eosin were proved to be lymphatic tissues. The tissue construction of purified adipose tissues was pure, and the cellular component was simple. Conversely, the tissue construction of unpurified adipose tissues was complicated, and cells were various with complicated components. Conclusion: The component of adipose tissues used to primary cultured adipose tissue-derived stem cells is complicated. As resection of superficial blood vessel, skin and muscle tissues, blood vessel inside tissues and lymphatic tissues should also be excised.

6344256857	Ultrastructural defects of acrosome in infertile men	To study the ultrastructural changes of acrosomes in fertile and infertile males and to identify the morphological alterations closely related to male infertility, forty spermatozoa from 8 fertile males and 60 spermatozoa from 12 infertile males were collected and observed by scanning electron microscope. There were significant changes in the morphology of the circular sulcus, acrosome membrane and head of the infertile sperm. The circular sulcus of spermatozoa was more serrated (39/60 vs 2/40) and blurred (40/60 vs 4/40) in the infertile group than in the fertile group. The acrosome of infertile group occupied a bigger proportion of sperm head (70 ± 8% vs 57 ± 6%) than in the fertile group. The acrosome membrane in the infertile group was less intact (18/60 vs 31/40) and less smooth (19/60 vs 32/40) than in the fertile group. More droplets were attached to the acrosome membrane in the infertile (39/60 vs 11/40) than in the fertile groups. The abnormality in acrosome ultrastructure seems to be significantly higher in infertile than in fertile males, suggesting a potential role of such defects for male fertility defect.

63049116201	Nedd4L expression is downregulated in prostate cancer compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia	Aims: To characterize aspects of Nedd4L in prostate cancer (PC) by assessing its expression in hyperplastic and malignant prostate tissue, and to correlate findings with PC histologic grade. Materials and methods: Radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens from 56 patients with clinically localized PC, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) transurethral resection specimens from 31 patients, were assessed for Nedd4L expression using immunohistochemistry. Results: Nedd4L (P < 0.001) expressions were significantly decreased in PC compared to benign prostate tissue. Furthermore, downregulation of Nedd4L (P < 0.05) expression correlated with increasing Gleason score. Conclusions: These data suggest that prostate cancer cells in vivo may need Nedd4L expression to regulate TGF-β1 signaling, and that Nedd4L expression might be involved in prostate cancer development.

67349245169	Transpubic Access Using Pedicle Tubularized Labial Urethroplasty for the Treatment of Female Urethral Strictures Associated with Urethrovaginal Fistulas Secondary to Pelvic Fracture	Background: Female urethral injury is rare, and there is no accepted standard approach for the repair of urethral strictures. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of transpubic access using pedicle tubularized labial urethroplasty for urethral reconstruction in female patients with urethral obliterative strictures and urethrovaginal fistulas. Design, setting, and participants: Between January 1996 and December 2006, eight cases of female urethral strictures associated with urethrovaginal fistulas were treated using pedicle labial skin flaps. Interventions: A flap of approximately 3 × 3.5 × 3 cm of the labia minora or majora with its vascular pedicle was tubularized over an 18-22 Fr fenestrated silicone stent to create a neourethra. This technique was used in five women. Two flaps, approximately 1.5-3.5 cm, were taken from bilateral labia minora or majora and were pieced together to create a neourethra. This technique was used in three patients. Measurements: We performed voiding cystourethrography and uroflowmetry to assess postoperative results. Results and limitations: The patients were followed up for 10-118 mo (mean 48.25 mo) after the procedure. There were no postoperative complications. Two patients complained of dysuria, which resolved spontaneously after 2 wk. One patient experienced stress incontinence that resolved after 4 wk. At 3-mo follow-up, one patient complained of difficulty voiding; the urinary peak flow was 13 ml/s, and the patient was treated successfully with urethral dilation. All other patients had normal micturition following catheter removal. Conclusions: Pedicle labial urethroplasty is a reliable technique for the repair of extensive urethral damage, and a transpubic surgical approach provides wide and excellent exposure for the management of complex obliterative urethral strictures and urethrovaginal fistulas secondary to pelvic fracture. © 2008 European Association of Urology.

67650541376	Application of stem cells in repair and reconstruction of low urinary system using tissue engineering technology	The research of urologic reconstruction with tissue engineering techniques has been carried out for a couple of years. However, the clinical application is impeded by the difficulties in drawing materials and lack of sufficient cells for seeding. The stem cells have the ability of self-renewal and differentiating into desired cell lines, which also have the advantage of less invasive to be harvested, provide new opportunities for further research. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in the autologous augmentation cystoplasty in recent years, and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells can undergo directed differentiation toward to endodermal derived urothelium in the appropriate signaling environment. The stem cells were supposed to differentiate in urethral tissue like cells in bladder tissue according to the similar inner environment. Transurethral ultrasound (TUUS)-guided injections of autologous myoblasts and fibroblasts is an effective and minimally invasive treatment modality to treat stress urinary incontinence. In addition, eNOS-transduced syngeneic MSCs can improve erectile function through accelerating eNOS expression and improving endothelial-derived NO biosynthesis.

67650000491	Biocompatibility of bladder acellular matrix graft after frozen and lyophilized processing	BACKGROUND: Bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) is frequently used for domains of tissue engineering scaffold due to its great biocompatibility and cell adhesion. OBJECTIVE: To verify the biological characteristics of BAMG after frozen and lyophilized processing. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A biocompatibility experiment was performed at Shanghai Tissue Engineering Research and Development Center and Experimental Animal Department of the Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai between May and November 2008. MATERIALS: Two New Zealand rabbits were used in this study for BAMG preparation. METHODS: After midsection of rabbit bladder, mucous membrane of urinary bladder was isolated and dipped in three-distilled water for 24 hours. Thereafter, the samples were incubated with acellular solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.15% aqueous ammonia for 14 days. The culture medium was changed regularly. The samples in the control group were stored in 75% ethanol, while samples in the experimental group were frozen for 24 hours at -80°C, vacuum-dried for 24 hours, and stored in 75% ethanol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biological characteristics of BAMG were detected using hematoxylin and eosin staining, Masson staining, and scanning electron microscopy; biological characteristics were compared between the two groups using cell adhesion test, MTT assay, and subcutaneously embedding test. RESULTS: Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Masson staining revealed that no residual cells were detected in the BAMG, and collagen was intact. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that cells exhibited a slit-shaped structure mainly containing collagen which was beneficial for cell adhesion. Mechanical test revealed that the BAMG after frozen and lyophilized processing not only reserved the mechanical properties of the raw BAMG, but also had a great elongation. MTT assay confirmed that cytotoxicity was grade 0, and BAMG had a good compatibility to smooth muscle cells. After subcutaneously embedding for one month, BAMGs had good adhesions to subcutaneous tissues, and muscular adhesion and vascular proliferation were observed. CONCLUSION: BAMG after frozen and lyophilized processing reserves original biocompatibility and has great elongation; therefore, it will become a useful and ideal biomaterial for tissue engineering scaffold.

68149100800	Urethral Reconstruction Using Colonic Mucosa Graft for Complex Strictures	Purpose: We investigated the long-term outcome of urethral reconstruction using colonic mucosa grafts for long segment, complex urethral strictures. Another aim was to identify clinical factors impacting long-term outcomes. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 36 consecutive patients with a mean age of 39.8 years (range 17 to 70) who underwent colonic mucosal graft urethroplasty for long segment, complex urethral stricture from October 2000 to November 2006. Patients were evaluated postoperatively at scheduled office visits at our institution and/or by telephone interview. Successful repair was defined as normal voiding without any postoperative procedure such as dilation. Results: Urethral reconstruction with done with colonic mucosa grafts 10 to 20 cm long (mean 15.1). One patient was lost to followup. Mean followup in the remaining cases was 53.6 months (range 26 to 94). Outcomes were successful in 30 of 35 patients (85.7%). Complications, specifically meatal stenosis, bulbar or bulbomembranous urethral stenosis and proximal anastomotic site stricture, developed in 5 patients (13.3%). Conclusions: Colonic mucosa graft urethroplasty is a feasible procedure for complex urethral strictures. The most common complications are meatal stenosis and stenosis at the anastomosis. © 2009 American Urological Association.

68149159273	Reinforcing the continent mechanism of continent cutaneous diversions by wrapped rectus abdominis muscle flap: A preliminary experimental study	Background: Continent cutaneous diversion (CCD) has been widely used in almost any lower urinary reconstruction. We have been continually trying to modify this procedure because of the high complications rate, especially as they relate to the efferent tube. In this study, we reported a modified procedure with a tapered ileum wrapped by the rectus abdominalis flap (RAMF) and assessed the feasibility of this new technique to achieve urinary continence. Methods: A procedure in which two ileal segments were tapered and connected to a U-shaped reservoir was performed in ten dogs. A RAMF with its blood supply was wrapped around one of the tapered ileum. In control groups, the tapered ileum was brought to the abdominal skin. Urodynamic studies were conducted In the 1st, 3rd and 6th months post-operatively. The data of maximum inner pressure (MIP) and functional pressure length (FPL) in every group at each phase were recorded. Retrograde radiograms of the efferent limbs were performed before sacrifice. Results: MIP in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group at each phase (P <0.05). However, no significant differences in MIP or FPL were found in the study group between an empty and full reservoir. In the control group, MIP increased (P <0.05) and FPL decreased significantly (P <0.05) compared with an empty and full reservoir. Retrograde radiograms confirmed that efferent limbs were positioned straigh beneath the abdominal wall. Histological examination of the study group demonstrated a layer of striated muscle around the outside surface of the ileum. Conclusion: The continent mechanism of tapered ileum can be enhanced by extra support from wrapped RAMF.

69249219310	Evaluation of erectile function after urethral reconstruction: A prospective study	We conducted a prospective study of erectile dysfunction (ED) after urethral reconstructive surgery, using the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5), the Sexual Life Quality Questionnaire (SLQQ) and the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoLQ). Between January 2003 and July 2007, 125 male patients with urethral strictures underwent urethroplasty, and pre- and post-surgery erectile function was assessed using these three questionnaires. A formula to predict the probability of ED after urethroplasty was derived. At 3 months post-operatively, there was a significant decrease in IIEF-5 (16.57 ± 7.98) and SLQQ scores (28.71 ± 14.84) compared with pre-operative scores (P < 0.05). However, the IIEF-5 scores rebounded at 6 months post-operatively (17.22 ± 8.41). Logistical regression analysis showed that the location of the urethral stricture, the recurrence of strictures and the choice of surgical technique were predictive of the post-operative occurrence of ED. This study identified the clinical risk factors for ED after urethroplasty. Posterior urethral stricture and end-to-end anastomosis were found to have a strong relationship with erectile function. The logistical model derived in this study may be applied to clinical decision algorithms for patients with urethral strictures.

68549133525	Oral mucosal grafts urethroplasty for the treatment of long segmented anterior urethral strictures	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of using oral mucosal grafts for urethroplasty in the treatment of complex segmented urethral strictures. Methods: Between January 2002 and January 2008, 25 cases of long or multi-segmented urethral strictures (10-18 cm, mean 11.72) were treated using combined two oral mucosal graft urethroplasty. Of the 25 patients, combined double buccal mucosal graft (BMG) urethroplasty was performed in nine patients, double lingual mucosal graft (LMG) urethroplasty in seven patients and combined lingual and buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty in nine patients. Results: Follow-up was obtained for 6-72 months (mean 26.83) post-operatively. Urethrocutaneous fistulas developed in two patients. Urethral strictures developed in one patient undergoing BMG urethroplasty; the patient underwent five urethral dilations, after which he voided well with a urinary peak flow of 26.4 ml/s. Meatal stenosis developed in one patient undergoing LMG and a second operation was required, after which the patient voided well (urinary peak flow of 28.7 ml/s). The other patients voided well and urinary peak flow rates ranged from 16.8 to 49.2 ml/s (mean 28.65 ml/s). Conclusion: Combined two oral mucosal grafts substitution urethroplasty is an effective technique for the treatment of long, segmented urethral strictures. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

70349237356	Lingual mucosal grafts for anterior urethroplasty: A review	We critically reviewed recent reports of lingual mucosal grafts (LMGs) for substitution urethroplasty, to determine the efficacy and complications of this approach. Only a few centres have published the short or interim outcome of LMG urethroplasty. These studies dealt mainly with surgical techniques and harvesting LMGs, emphasizing the comparison of different intra-oral donor sites. The preliminary results seem to be encouraging for the safety and efficacy of LMG urethroplasty. When compared with other substitute materials, LMG give equally good results with much easier harvesting and minimal donor site morbidity. Thus, lingual mucosa is most likely to become an alternative to oral mucosa for substitution urethroplasty and longer term results of its use are awaited with interest. © 2009 BJU International.

70350568912	Transperineal Bulboprostatic Anastomosis in Patients With Simple Traumatic Posterior Urethral Strictures: A Retrospective Study from a Referral Urethral Center	Objectives: To evaluate the results of ancillary procedures for posterior urethroplasty and compare them with the severity of urethral stricture. Methods: A total of 301 patients (average age: 36 years) with posterior urethral strictures due to pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects were included in the study. Delayed transperineal bulboprostatic anastomosis was performed 6-24 months (mean 10 months) after pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects. Simple perineal anastomosis: 103 (34.2%) patients (group 1); perineal anastomosis with separation of the corporeal bodies: 89 (29.6%) patients (group 2); perineal anastomosis with inferior pubectomy: 95 (31.6%) patients (group 3); perineal anastomosis with rerouting of the urethra around the corpora cavernosum: 14 (4.7%) patients (group 4). The clinical outcome was considered a failure when any postoperative instrumentation was needed. The primary outcome examined the total success rate of the procedures. The secondary outcome examined the success rate of the procedures according to the ancillary surgical steps. Results: Of the 301 delayed transperineal bulboprostatic anastomosis procedures, 263 (87.4%) were successful and 38 (12.6%) were unsuccessful. Simple perineal anastomosis without ancillary procedures reflected an 89.3% success rate, perineal anastomosis with separation of the corporeal body had an 86.5% success rate, perineal anastomosis with inferior pubectomy had an 84.2% success rate, and perineal anastomosis with urethral rerouting had an 85.7% success rate. Conclusions: Corporal splitting, inferior pubectomy, and urethral rerouting are beneficial and useful ancillary procedures in transperineal posterior urethroplasty to achieve tension-free anastomosis.

0035135148	Enhanced continent mechanism of tapered ileum by extramural support from the pouch and abdominal walls: A preliminary report of a clinical study	Purpose: We constructed a reliable continent tube that is easy to catheterize and surgically simple. Materials and Methods: Eight patients with bladder cancer underwent a procedure in which ileal segment was tapered as an efferent tube, of which a part was placed between the back surface of the rectus muscle and the ileal pouch wall. The internal orifice of the tapered ileum was anastomosed to the ileal pouch and its external orifice was anastomosed to the umbilicus. Urodynamic and radiological studies were done postoperatively in 7 cases. Results: The stoma was easily catheterized with a 16Fr catheter in all cases. One patient died of heart disease 55 days postoperatively, while 6 of the remaining 7 were completely continent day and night. Urodynamic study of the efferent tubes showed that maximum close pressure with the pouch full was significantly higher than with the pouch empty (p <0.001). Retrograde radiography of the efferent tubes demonstrated perfect canalization without stenosis. Conclusions: This study indicates that the continent mechanism of tapered ileum may be greatly enhanced by fixing it between the abdominal and pouch walls. This maneuver also provides easy catheterization and surgical simplicity.

72149124475	Comparison of the clinical effectiveness of bipolar plasmakinetic enucleation of prostate and bipolar plasmakinetic resection of prostate	Objective: To compare the efficacy and complications between bipolar plasmakinetic resection of prostate and bipolar plasmakinetic enucleation of prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH). Methods: 303 cases of BPH were divided into 2 groups, 143 cases aged (74.0±12.4) years with prostate volume of (75.6±13.5)ml underwent PKRP; 160 cases aged (76.0±15.5) years with prostate volume of (77.3±12.5)ml underwent PKEP. The operative time, resected tissue weighed, blood loss, catheterization time, hospital stay and complications were compared between the 2groups. Results: In 2 group, the postoperative RUV, IPSS, QOL and Qmax were significantly improved after both procedures(P<0.05), but there was no significant difference in the above parameters between the 2 groups(P>0.05). Blood loss and contemporary incontinence were significant differences between the 2 groups(P<0.05). The operative time, resected tissue weighed, catheterization time, hospital stay, secondary bleeding and 3 monthes after operation urethral stricture were no significant differences between the 2 groups(P>0.05). Conclusion: The 2 surgical procedures have significant efficacy in the treatment of BPH. But the blood loss and incidences of contemporary incontinence of PKER have more superiority than those of PKRP, so PKER deserves our application.

74649084206	Surgical Treatment of 31 Complex Traumatic Posterior Urethral Strictures Associated with Urethrorectal Fistulas	Background: Urethrorectal fistulas (URF) in patients with complex posterior urethral strictures are rare and difficult to repair surgically. There is no widely accepted standard approach described in the published literature. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the outcomes of various operative approaches for the repair of URFs in patients with complex posterior urethral strictures. Design, setting, and participants: From January 1985 to December 2007, 31 patients (age: 6-61 yr; mean: 28.4) with URFs secondary to posterior urethral strictures were treated using a perineal or combined abdominal transpubic-perineal approach. Interventions: A simple perineal approach was used in 4 patients; a transperineal inferior pubectomy approach was used in 18 patients; and a combined transpubic-perineal approach was used in 9 patients. A bulbospongiosus muscle and subcutaneous dartos pedicle flaps were interposed between the repaired rectum and urethra in 22 patients. The combined transpubic-perineal approach used either a gracilis muscle flap (one patient) or a rectus muscle flap (eight patients). Measurements: Suprapubic catheterisation was used for bladder drainage, and a urethral silicone stent was left indwelling for 4 wk. Results and limitations: One-stage repair was successful in 4 patients (100%) using the perineal approach, in 16 of 18 patients (88.9%) using the transperineal-inferior pubectomy approach, and in 7 of 9 patients (77.8%) using the transpubic-perineal approach. Recurrent urethral strictures developed in two cases; one patient required regular dilation, and the other patient was treated successfully with tubed perineoscrotal flap urethroplasty. Recurrent URFs developed in two additional patients. Conclusions: Surgical approaches for the treatment of URFs associated with complex urethral strictures should be based on a number of considerations including the location of the URF, its aetiology, the length of the urethral strictures, and a history of previous unsuccessful repairs. These results demonstrate that the transperineal-inferior pubic approach may be appropriate as a first-line procedure. © 2009 European Association of Urology.

77149173471	Treatment of urethral strictures using lingual mucosas urethroplasty: Experience of 92 cases	Background: Urethroplasty of complex urethral stricture is a difficult procedure, and there is no widely accepted standard approach described in the published literature. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of urethroplasty using lingual mucosa grafts (LMGs) for the repair of urethral strictures. Methods: Between August 2006 and April 2009, 92 cases of urethral strictures (length ranging from 2.5 cm to 18 cm, mean 6.5 cm) were treated using LMGs. Of the 92 patients, 38 with long-segment urethral strictures (9-18 cm) underwent dual LMG or LMG combined with foreskin flap or buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty. Results: Follow-up was obtained for 3-33 months (mean 17.2 months) postoperatively. Complications occurred in 8 patients, including urinary fistulas in 4 patients; recurrent strictures developed in 4 patients at 3-4 months post-operatively. The remaining patients voided well postoperatively, with peak flows between 14.3 ml/s and 54.6 ml/s (mean 28.4 ml/s). Conclusions: The tongue is an excellent source of graft material for the repair of anterior mucosal strictures. Dual LMG substitution urethroplasty can successfully treat longer, more complex urethral strictures.

77952720027	Evaluation of the biocompatibility and mechanical properties of naturally derived and synthetic scaffolds for urethral reconstruction	The aim of this study was to evaluate the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of biomaterials, including bladder submucosa (BAMG), small intestinal submucosa (SIS), acellular corpus spongiosum matrix (ACSM), and polyglycolic acid (PGA), to identify the optimal scaffold for urethral tissue engineering. Tensile mechanical testing was conducted to evaluate mechanical properties of each scaffold. Rabbit corporal smooth muscle cells were cultured with the extracts of biomaterials and mitochondrial metabolic activity assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of scaffold. The pore sizes of each scaffold were measured. Additionally, smooth muscle cells were seeded on biomaterials. Cell infiltration was evaluated. Mechanical evaluation showed that Young modulus, stress at break in ACSM were prior to those in other biomaterials (p < 0.05). MTT assay confirmed that all scaffolds supported normal cellular mitochondrial metabolic without inducing cytotoxic events. SEM demonstrated that PGA has the largest pore size (>200 μm). The ACSM has different pore sizes in urethral (<5 μm) and cavernosal surfaces (>10 μm). Widespread distribution of cells could be observed in PGA 14 days after seeding. Multilayer cellular coverage developed in BAMG and urethral surface of ACSM without any sign of cellular invasion. Moderated cellular penetration could be found in SIS and cavernosal surface of ACSM. Although each scaffold demonstrated suitable mechanical properties, which is similar to normal urethra, ACSM showed better response in some parameters than those in other biomaterials. It suggested that this scaffold may be an alternative for urethral reconstruction in the future. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77953569312	Cadaveric study of nerves supplying the membranous urethra	Aims: To better understand the anatomy of the region of the male membranous urethra in order to preserve continence during radical cystectomy and prostatectomy. Methods: Cadaveric dissections of 15 male specimens were undertaken to investigate the nerves to membranous urethra. The nerves were traced from both an intrapelvic approach and a perineal approach. The origin, course, and distribution of the branches to the membranous urethra region were investigated in detail. Results: The membranous urethra is innervated by branches of inferior hypogastric plexus (IHP) and intrapelvic and extrapelvic branches of pudendal nerve (PN). The pelvic nerve fromIHP originated from the caudal most root of the pelvic splanchnic nerve, running along the surface of the levator ani muscle (LAM) to enter the membranous urethra at the 5 and 7 O'clock positions. In 40% of specimens we found that the intrapelvic branches were supplied by the PN. Before exiting the pudendal canal, PN gives off an intrapelvic branch that traverses the LAM to course with the pelvic nerve and innervate the membranous urethra; the distance between these intrapelvic branches and prostatic apex is 5.3 ± 1.8mm. The branches originating from the dorsal nerve of penis innervate the membranous urethra in 53.3% of specimens; these nerve branches are located 4.2 ± 1.1mm from the prostatic apex. Conclusions: Dissection of the seminal vesicles and the prostatic apex during radical cystectomy and prostatectomy likely injures the nerve responsible for continence. Neurourol.

77953290003	Diagnostic puzzle of inflammatory pseudotumor of the urinary bladder: A case report with brief literature review	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the urinary bladder is a rare reactive proliferation with a clinical presentation similar to malignant neoplasms. We present the case of a 35-year-old woman who presented with left lower quadrant pain and gross hematuria. A diagnosis of cystitis glandularis was initially considered; however, the symptoms did not resolve following transurethral resection. Subsequently, a partial cystectomy was performed after malignancy was excluded based on intraoperative frozen sections. Further histopathological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of inflammatory pseudotumor. Copyright © 2010 by The Southern Medical Association.

77953431652	Primary culture of adipose-derived stem cells and differentiation induction into myoblasts	Objective: To explore the method of culture of rat adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and differentiation induction into myoblasts. Methods: Adipose tissues were obtained from SD rats, and were isolated by enzyme digestion and cultured into ADSCs. The expression of surface antigen CD90, CD105 and CD34 was detected by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. ADSCs of the second passage with logarithmic growth were obtained, and culture media containing 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and basic culture media were employed for cells in induction group and control group, respectively. The induction lasted for 7 d, 14 d, 21 d, 28 d and 35 d, respectively. Cell growth and cell morphology were observed by inverted phase contrast microscope, and immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were utilized to detect the expression of myoblast specific antigens desmin and myosin. Results: ADSCs were successfully isolated and cultured, and were identified to be stem cells. On the 28th day of induction, cells in induction group displayed "swirl" morpholgy, and multinucleation was observed. It was revealed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry that the highest expression rates of desmin and myosin were 52.57% and 50.04%, respectively on the 28th day of induction, while there was no expression before induction and in control group. Conclusion: ADSCs can be isolated and cultured from rat adipose tissues, and can further differentiate into myoblasts after induction by culture media with 5-aza. The expression of myoblast specific antigen is the highest on the 28th day of induction.

77953441456	Bladder leiomyosarcoma following cyclophosphamide therapy for breast cancer	An unusual case of a bladder leiomyosarcoma after cyclophosphamide (CPM) chemotherapy for breast cancer is reported. A 50-year-old female presented with urinary frequency and urgency was found by computed tomography and ultrasound to have a mass in her urinary bladder. Cystoscopy displayed a mass on her left bladder wall and biop-sies of the mass revealed chronic inflammation of the uroepithelium. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and an intra-operative frozen section examination revealed a malignant spindle cell tumor. Partial cystectomy was per-formed and the final pathologic examination confirmed low potential malignancy leiomyosarcoma. The present report is significant not only because leiomyosarcoma as a second tumor after CPM therapy for breast cancer is very rare, but also because the total dose of CPM was only 9.6 g and the interval from initial CPM treatment was only 8 months. A review of the literature shows the necessity for extensive follow-up after CPM therapy. Copyright © 0080 S. Karger AG.

77954865041	Bladder reconstruction with adipose-derived stem cell-seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts improve morphology composition	Purpose: To assess the feasibility of seeding adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) onto bladder acellular matrix grafts (BAMGs) for bladder reconstruction in a rabbit model. Methods: Autologous ADSCs were isolated, expanded and identified by flow cytometry. In the experimental group, ADSCs were seeded onto BAMGS for reconstructing bladder defects in 12 male rabbits. Unseeded BAMGs were used for bladder reconstruction in the control group of 12 rabbits. Cystography was performed at 4, 12 and 24 weeks after grafts implantation. Following cystography, the animals were killed and grafts were harvested; H&E and immunohistochemical staining were performed with cytokeratin AE1/AE3, smooth muscle α-actin and S-100 markers. Results: Flow cytometry demonstrated that the ADSCs expressed CD90, CD44, CD105, CD166 and CD34, but not CD45 or CD106. The cells demonstrated good biocompatibility with BAMGs. At 24 weeks, in the experimental group, the reconstructed bladders reached a mean volume of 94.68 ± 3.31% of the pre-cystectomy bladder capacity. Complete regeneration of smooth muscle and nerve tissue was evident. Regenerated SMCs, urothelium and nerve cells stained positively for α-smooth muscle actin, AE1/AE3 and S-100. In the control group, the mean bladder volume was 69.33 ± 5.05% of the pre-cystectomy volume; histologically, the control group was characterized by multi-layered urothelium without evidence for organized muscle or nerve tissue. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that seeding ADSCs onto BAMGs promote regeneration of smooth muscle and nervous tissue regeneration in a rabbit model. This compound graft was more suitable for bladder reconstruction than BAMG alone. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79955088003	The comparison of two experimental rat varicocele models and their effect on sperm quality	Objective: To develop a modified rat varicocele model. Methods: 300 male Sprague-Dawley rats were selected. In 82 rats (classic group, CG), this was achieved by dissecting the left renal vein and ligating it using a 0.8-mm metal clip and 3-0 silk suture proximal to the inferior vena cava, followed by removal of the bar. In 118 rats (modified group, MG), in addition to the partial ligation of the left renal vein, the communicating branch was fully ligated. In 100 rats (sham operation group, SG), the left renal vein and communicating branches were dissected, but not ligated. The seminal fluid was aspirated and the diameters of the left spermatic veins were analyzed. Three months later, the examination was performed again. Results: The diameters were 0.16 ± 0.1 mm and 1.88 ± 0.1 mm before and after operation, respectively, in the CG (p < 0.01), and 0.15 ± 0.05 mm and 2.0 ± 0.1 mm in the MG (p < 0.01). Postsurgical diameters in the CG and MG were 1.88 ± 0.1 mm and 2.0 ± 0.1 mm (p > 0.5), and 0.16 ± 0.1 mm and 0.16 ± 0.11 mm in the SG (p > 0.5). Semen parameters in the CG had significant differences before and after the operation (p < 0.01), were significantly lower in the MG (p < 0.01), and had no significant differences in the SG (p > 0.5). Conclusion: Simple partial ligation of the renal vein combined with ligation of the communicating branch leads to acceptable models for varicocele. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

79955673221	Cyclin-dependent kinase-associated protein Cks2 is associated with bladder cancer progression	In this observational retrospective study, expression of possible cancer-related genes was measured in patients with a pathological diagnosis of superficial bladder cancer. Further measurements were made in those who subsequently developed muscle-invasive cancer. Seven of the 45 patients with superficial bladder cancer progressed to muscle-invasive cancer. Expression of fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5), poly(A) binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), DEAD box polypeptide 5 (DDX5), splicing factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1), murine mammary tumour integration site 6 (EIF3S6), tropomyosin 2β (TPM2), transgelin (TAGLN) and cyclin-dependent kinase-associated protein (Cks2) genes was measured in bladder samples using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. FABP5, PABPC1, DDX5, SF3B1, EIF3S6 and Cks2 expression levels were significantly increased, and TPM2 and TAGLN were significantly decreased, in superficial bladder cancer compared with normal bladder tissue. In patients who developed muscle-invasive cancer, the Cks2 gene showed significantly increased expression after, compared with before, invasion. The Cks2 gene may have potential as a biomarker for predicting superficial bladder cancer progression to muscleinvasive cancer. © 2011 Field House Publishing LLP.

0036210149	Study of efferent tube suspension as a continent diversion mechanism: An experimental study in dogs	Purpose: To construct a reliable continent tube, which is easy to catheterize and surgically simple. Materials and Methods: 8 adult female mongrel dogs underwent a procedure in which an ileal segment was tapered as an efferent tube. The tapered ileum was fixed to the back surface of the rectus muscle with a polyester taper 1.5 cm in width and a suspension tension of 400 g. The internal orifice of the tapered ileum was anastomosed to the bladder and the external orifice of the tapered ileum was brought out to the abdominal skin. Urodynamic and radiological studies were carried out postoperatively in all dogs. Results: All stomas in dogs could be easily catheterized with a 14-french catheter. Urodynamic study of the efferent tubes showed that the maximum closure pressure ranged from 117 to 157 (mean 136.75) cm water. Retrograde radiogram of the efferent tubes showed perfect canalization without stenosis. Conclusion: This study suggests that the continent mechanism of the tapered ileum can be greatly enhanced by a suspension technique. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0036673929	An experimental study of colonic mucosal graft for urethral reconstruction	Objective. To investigate the possibility of urethral reconstruction with a free colonic mucosal graft. Methods. Ten female dogs underwent a procedure in which the urethral mucosa was totally removed and replaced with a free graft of colic mucosa. A urodynamic study was performed before the operation and sacrifice. The dogs were sacrificed 8 to 16 weeks after the operation for histological examination of the urethra. Results. Urethral stricture developed in 1 dog. The results of urody namic studies showed that the difference in maximum urethral pressure between pre-operation and pre-sacrifice in the remaining 9 dogs was not of significance ( P > 0. 05). Histological examination revealed that the colonic free mucosa survived inside the urethral lumen of the 9 dogs. Plicae surface and unilaminar cylindric epithelium of the colonic mucosa was observed in dogs sacrificed 8 weeks after the operation. Plicae surface and unilaminar cylindric epithelium of the colonic mucosa was not observed and metaplastic transitional epithelium covered a large proportion of the urethral mucosa in dogs sacrificed 12 weeks after the operation. Conclusions. Urethral mucosa can be replaced by colonic mucosa without damaging the continence mechanism in female dogs. This technique is useful when local or preputial skin and buccal or bladder mucosa are not available.

79959301946	Oral complications after lingual mucosal graft harvesting for urethroplasty in 110 cases	Lingual mucosal graft harvesting for urethroplasty is feasible, safe, provides long grafts and is easy to carry out. Most patients have minimal immediate or short-term donor site complications. The oral complications appeared to be related to the graft length and patient age. Most complications resolved within 1 year. Oral complications after LMGs harvesting were related to the patient's age at surgery. The children did not experience any persistent complications. Cases of bilateral or longer LMGs were associated with higher complication rates. However, most of these oral complications subsided gradually within 1 year. OBJECTIVE • This study was to evaluate donor-site complications of lingual mucosal graft harvesting for substitution urethroplasty. PATIENTS AND METHODS • 110 patients with anterior urethral strictures or hypospadias underwent lingual mucosal grafts (LMGs) urethroplasty. Dual LMGs were harvested from both sites separately or a long mucosal graft was harvested from one side to other side of tongue in 29 patients (group one); a shorter mucosal graft was harvested from one side of tongue in 81 patients (group two). A standard proforma (Appendix) was used for all patients. RESULTS • The mean follow up time was 22 months (range 6∼41). At six months follow-up, numbness of tongue was reported in 19 patients (17.27%), parageusias in six (5.45%) and slurring of speech in 9 (8.18%). • Ninety-six patients were followed up for more than 12 mo. Numbness in operative area of tongue was documented in seven patients (7.29%), parageusias in three (3.13%) and slurred speech in three (3.13%). • None of these complications occurred in the six pediatric cases (<14 year) with a history of failed hypospadias repair. CONCLUSIONS • LMGs urethroplasty, as most patients, were satisfied, but there were certain complications that have not been previously described in the literature. • Most oral complications subsided gradually within the first year. © 2010 BJU International.

79958227289	Combined buccal and lingual mucosa grafts for urethroplasty: An experimental study in dogs	Background: To evaluate combined buccal mucosa and lingual mucosa grafts for urethroplasty in a dog model. Materials and Methods: Seven female mongrel dogs were randomly selected. After a segment of proximal urethra mucosa (4cm × 1cm) was excised and onlayed urethroplasty was performed using the combined free buccal mucosa (2cm × 1cm) graft harvested from the inferior cheek and free lingual mucosa graft (2cm × 1cm) harvested from the inferior lateral surface of the tongue. A 12F urethral catheter was kept inside the urethra for a mean of 7 d. Retrograde urethrography was done and urethra diameter was calibrated with a 10Fr catheter before animals were sacrificed at wk 12. After sacrifice of all dogs, the grafted areas excised and evaluated by gross and histopathological examination. Results: All dogs survived the procedure and there were no tongue and oral complications. One of the seven dogs developed a severe urethral stricture near the proximal anastomosis. The remaining six dogs voided spontaneously with no difficulty. Retrograde urethrography showed that no strictures or fistulas had formed. The combined buccal mucosa graft and lingual mucosa graft shortened by 10.2% after surgery, from a mean (SD) of 4 (0.15) to 3.59 (0.23) cm (statistical significance, P < 0.05). No stricture was found in the connection of the buccal mucosa and lingual mucosa grafts. Histologic examination showed that the combined buccal mucosa and lingual mucosa grafts were well-incorporated into the urethral walls and covered by a keratinized squamous epithelium. Conclusions: We successfully developed a dog model for combined buccal mucosa graft and lingual mucosa graft and showed the feasibility of this approach for urethral substitution. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79960975569	Decreased testicular expression of camp response element modulator (CREM) in rat with varicocele	This study examines the hypothesis that varicocele would impair the testicular expression of cAMP response element modulator (CREM) in experimental rats. Thirty (30) rats were selected at random, of 20 were operated as varicocele's group; of 10 were for sham-operation as controlled group, testes were removed, fixed and stained in three months. Makler Score was adopted to analyze the bore, limitan's thickness, layer number of cell, the degree of cell's maturity and average score in 200 and 100 seminiferous tubulae, respectively. CREM, HSP60 was determinated by hybridization in situ, the differences between two groups were compared. In varicocele group, seminiferous tubule's bore was decreased (101 ± 2.2 vs 146 ± 4.1), limitan became thicker (3.5 ± 0.1 vs 1.9 ± 0.2), cell's layer number was reduced (3.0 ± 0.2 vs 5.5 ± 0.1), cell's maturity turned to disturbance (3.6 ± 0.3 vs 4.9 ± 0.1), the average score was lower than controlled group (8.5 ± 0.6 vs 16.0 ± 1.2), they had significant differences (P < 0.001). The testicular CREM expression was significantly lower in varicocele group than in controlled one (VG2.0 ± 0.32, SoG3.90 ± 0.32)(P < 0.001), which was located in spermatogenous cell to spermatocyte stage. However, HSP60 expression in VG was higher than in SoG (3.85 ± 0.3 versus 2.1 ± 0.32) with significant differences (P < 0.001), the expression located in spermatid. Varicocele could lead to lower testicular CREM expression and breeding sperm functional lesion. © 2005 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

The retrospective study consisted of 116 patients. Chinese translations of the modified Lemack Questionnaire (not validated) and Pelvic Floor Distress InventoryShort Form 20 were used to assess FSF and HRQOL, 3 months pre-operatively and 12-24 months (mean 16.8 months) post-operatively. Sixty-one (52.6%, 29 in SUI group and 32 in POP group) of patients were sexually active before and after the operation. Overall, 12 (19.7%, six in SUI group and six in POP group) reported an improvement in overall intercourse satisfaction, 21 (34.4%, 8 in the SUI and 13 in the POP group) were decreased and 28 (45.9%, 15 in SUI group and 13 in POP group) were unchanged. Incidence of coital incontinence decreased significantly in SUI group. Frequency of intercourse decreased, vaginal dryness and pain due to it and asymptomatic vaginal narrowing increased significantly, following the surgery in POP group. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of intercourse in SUI group, patients perception of intercourse, frequency of orgasm and the importance of sex life in both groups. Partner discomfort remained unchanged. HRQOL improved significantly after the operation in both groups. There was no association between HRQOL and FSF in the post-operative period. In most patients, overall FSF did not impaired. All trans-anterior vaginal wall surgery positively impacted on the patients HRQOL. A prospective study with validated questionnaire is necessary in future. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

There were significant changes in the morphology of the circular sulcus, acrosome membrane and head of the infertile sperm. The circular sulcus of spermatozoa was more serrated (39/60 vs 2/40) and blurred (40/60 vs 4/40) in the infertile group than in the fertile group. The acrosome of infertile group occupied a bigger proportion of sperm head (70±8% vs 57±6%) than in the fertile group. The acrosome membrane in the infertile group was less intact (18/60 vs 31/40) and less smooth (19/60 vs 32/40) than in the fertile group. More droplets were attached to the acrosome membrane in the infertile (39/60 vs 11/40) than in the fertile groups. The abnormality in acrosome ultrastructure seems to be significantly higher in infertile than in fertile males, suggesting a potential role of such defects for male fertility defect.

79961190470	Urethral cystoscopic realignment and early end-to-end anastomosis develop different influence on erectile function in patients with ruptured bulbous urethra	The objective of this study is to compare the influence on erectile function between urethral cystoscopic realignment and early end-to-end anastomosis treating ruptured bulbous urethra. 58 cases were selected, 32 had urethral cystoscopic realignment (group I) and 26 cases had urethral end-to-end anastomosis (group II). The parameters of P-CDU (Penile Color Duplex Ultrasound), NPT (Nocturnal Penile Tumescence), and IIEF-5 (International Index of Erectile Function) were compared between the two groups 6 months after operation. Group I was higher than group II in IIEF (21 vs 14) with significant differences. With P-CDU we observed an improvement in penile vascularization in group I as confirmed by the detection of an increase in peak systolic velocity (PSV) (26 cm/s vs 16 cm/s, p < 0.01) and a decrease in end diastolic velocity (EDV) (3 cm/s vs 6 cm/s p < 0.05), resulting in an increase in resistive index (RI) (0.85 vs 0.56, p < 0.05). The parameters of NPT showed a significant increase compared to group II (p < 0.01) in satisfactory erection number (5 vs 1.5), maximum rigidity (80% vs 42%), and total time that the increase in circumference was greater than 30% of baseline during sleep (100 sec vs 30 sec). Urethral cystoscopic realignment treating ruptured bulbous urethra can reduce the incidence of erectile dysfunction [ED]. A long term follow-up should be studied. Copyright © Informa Healthcare.

80053388196	Transperineal bulbo-prostatic anastomosis for posterior urethral stricture associated with false passage: A single-centre experience	Study Type - Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4 What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The emergency treatment of patients with PFUDD in developing countries is not currently codified and the majority of these patients have been treated using incorrect procedures that add iatrogenic damage to the trauma. Sometimes urethral dilatation gruffly and repeatedly wound lead to formation of urethral false passage which results in infection and incontinence. The treatment of urethral false passage is still a major challenge for urologists. False passage can lead to prolonged unhealed infections, increase the scar around the urethra, increasing stricture significantly. If preoperative examination was careless, it leads to identify false passage difficultly intra-operative, the variation of direction when the curved sound was used as internal guidance, anastomosis between distal urethra and bladder wall near the orificium urethrae internum, leading to surgical failure. Cystourethrogram, flexible cystocopy pre-operatively and dissect urethral bulb carefully are key points of urethroplasty for posterior urethral stricture with false passage. Then to pass a curved sound via the suprapubic tract into the posterior urethra to act as a guide for subsequent excision of all scar tissue. OBJECTIVE • To evaluate the management of traumatic posterior urethral stricture associated with false passage, as this remains a challenge for urologists. PATIENTS AND METHODS • From January 2000 to February 2010, 19 patients (mean (range) age 34 [25-52] years) with traumatic posterior urethral obliteration associated with false passage were evaluated and treated at our centre. • All patients underwent perineal excision and primary anastomotic urethroplasty using cystoscopy by the suprapubic route to insert a guidewire into the original bladder neck, allowing exposure of the normal posterior urethra. • Patients underwent voiding cysto-urethrography 1 month after the procedure. When symptoms of decreased force of stream were present and uroflowmetry was <15 mL/s, urethrography and urethroscopy were repeated. • Clinical outcome was considered a failure when any postoperative instrumentation was needed, including dilatation. RESULTS • The mean (range) follow-up was 12 (9-14) months. The overall success rate was 84%. • Three patients (16%) with persistent voiding difficulty developed a short anastomotic stricture 1-3 months after surgery. • The mean maximum urinary flow rate after surgery was 20.01 mL/s and no patient had urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION • The preoperative use of flexible cystoscopy via the suprapubic route represented a successful key point of urethroplasty for posterior urethral stricture associated with false passage. © 2011 BJU INTERNATIONAL.

80054692073	Adipose tissue-derived stem cells in oral mucosa tissue engineering: Enhanced migration and proliferation in co-culture with oral keratinocytes in vitro	Tissue-engineered oral mucosa holds a great prospect in urethroplasty and adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) may play an important role in this field. In this research, canine oral keratinocytes (OKs) and ADSCs were harvested and cultured in vitro. The affinity between the two cell lines was evaluated by analyzing their migration and proliferation patterns in a co-culture environment. The results demonstrate that both canine ADSCs and OKs showed improved migration in the presence of the other cell line as a co-culture when compared to monoculture. Further, conditioned medium using the supernatant of one cell line accelerated the other cell line's proliferation rate. Hence, it was concluded that the affinity between OKs and ADSCs was fitting; the presence of ADSCs accelerated the migration and proliferation of OKs in vitro. These results indicate that it is practical to use ADSCs and OKs to construct a tissue-engineered oral mucosa, since the presence of the former could activate the latter in vitro, maybe even in vivo. This may help to build tissue-engineered oral mucosa, which may be a new method for urethroplasty. © 2011 Academic Journals.

80755128497	Different bladder defects reconstructed with bladder acellular matrix grafts in a rabbit model	Objective: To evaluate the potential use of the bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG), two different bladder defects in the rabbit model were reconstructed. Materials and methods: Two groups of rabbits underwent partial bladder wall cystectomy (group A, 30-40%; group B, 70-60%) and reconstruction of the defects with an equally sized BAMG. After 4, 12, and 24 weeks, bladder cystographs were performed. Then the rabbits were killed after uneventful postoperative periods, and the grafts were harvested for H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining. Results: Two rabbits died on the postoperative days 3 and 6 in group A due to urinary peritonitis. At 24 weeks, in group A, the reconstructed bladders reached a mean volume of 94.39±0.54% of the precystectomy bladder capacity. Histologically, complete regeneration of smooth muscle and urothelium tissue was evident. Regenerated SMCs and urothelium stained positive for α-smooth muscle actin and AE1/AE3. In group B, the mean bladder volume was 64.5±3.19% of the precystectomy volume. Histologically, group B was characterized by multilayered urothelium without organized muscle tissue. Conclusion: The BAMG was an effective scaffold for bladder wall regeneration in the rabbit model. However, the use of BAMG reconstruction in larger bladder defects did not induce the same quality and quantity of bladder regeneration as the reconstruction of smaller bladder defects. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

82355184370	Reconstruction of three-dimensional neourethra using lingual keratinocytes and corporal smooth muscle cells seeded acellular corporal spongiosum	Tissue engineering technique seems to be the best strategy for treating the urethra disease in the near future. In present study, porcine acellular corpus spongiosum matrices (ACSMs) were combined with autologus corporal smooth muscle cells (CSMCs) and lingual keratinocytes by static-dynamic seeding method to form three-dimensional (3D) "neourethra" tissue for repairing the urethral defection. Six scaffolds with two kinds of cells (Group C), six scaffolds with only lingual keratinocytes (Group B), and six matrices alone (Group A) were used to repair the rabbit urethral defection. Retrograde urethrography and histological analyses were performed to evaluate the results of urethroplasty. In vitro, hematoxylin and eosin staining of seeded ACSM showed multiple epithelial layers and well-distributed CSMCs into the matrix. In vivo, the urethra kept a wide caliber in Group C. Strictures were observed in groups A and B. Histologically, the retrieved urethra in group A showed fibrosis and inflammation during 6 months. Simple epithelial layer regenerated in group B while there was no evidence of CSMCs growing into grafts during study period. Stratified epithelial layer and organized muscle fiber bundles were evident after 6 months in group C. Our study suggested that lingual keratinocytes and CSMCs could be used as a source of seed cells for urethral tissue engineering. Using the dynamic-static seeding method, 3D urethra could be constructed in vivo. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84856232923	Improving voiding efficiency in the diabetic rat by a 5-HT1A serotonin receptor agonist	Aims Serotonin affects micturition in the normal rat through actions not only on ascending and descending spinal pathways and supraspinal centers but also on the lumbosacral spinal cord level. The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT((R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin), reversed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) in the spinal cord injury (SCI) rat. Rats with experimental diabetes mellitus (DM) have been shown to have both bladder and urethral dysfunction during reflex voiding. We therefore examined the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on micturition in DM rats. Methods Female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. DM was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 65 mg/kg) and a cystometric study was performed 8 weeks post-injection. External urethral sphincter electromyography (EUS-EMG) was also measured. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635(N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl) -2-phenylpropanamide) was administered after each 8-OH-DPAT dose-response. Results Compared to controls, DM rats had a higher bladder capacity, residual volume, and a lower voiding efficiency. In DM rats, 8-OH-DPAT (3-1,000 μ;g/kg, i.v.) induced significant dose-dependent increases in micturition volume, and decreases in residual volume, resulting in increases in voiding efficiency. During the micturition, there was a dose-dependent increased phasic EUS activity correlated with the improved voiding efficiency. WAY-100635 (300 μ;g/kg, i.v.) reversed the 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes. Conclusions Both the bladder voiding efficiency and the periodic EUS activity were decreased in DM rats. 5-HT1A receptor agonism promoted periodic EUS activity, thereby improving voiding efficiency. Whether or not these results may have implications for the future treatment of voiding dysfunction in DM patients remains to be studied. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84862754482	Long-term outcome of duplex kidney with ectopic ureter treated by antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation	Introduction: We present our 35 years' experience of managing duplex kidneys with ectopic ureter by simple antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation. Patients and Methods: From December 1974 to April 2009, 36 female children, aged 10 months to 13 years, were treated. Hutch's antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation was performed after preoperative location and intraoperative identification of the unilateral or bilateral ectopic ureters. Results: Thirty-one patients had follow-up data (range 11 months to 25 years). Postoperatively, there were no reports of dribbling incontinence, urinary frequency, lumbago or recurrent fever with the exception of urinary incontinence in 2 patients. Cystography and intravenous pyelography performed in 27 cases showed no or minimal bladder-ureter reflux. Superior kidney hydronephrosis improved in 12 cases and showed no change in the remaining patients. Conclusions: Antireflux ureterocystic reimplantation is a simple method to treat the duplex kidney with ectopic ureter with minimal induced trauma. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG.

84866127518	Significantly reinforced composite fibers electrospun from silk fibroin/carbon nanotube aqueous solutions	Microcomposite fibers of regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were successfully prepared by an electrospinning process from aqueous solutions. A quiescent blended solution and a three-dimensional Raman image of the composite fibers showed that functionalized MWNTs (F-MWNTs) were well dispersed in the solutions and the RSF fibers, respectively. Raman spectra and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) patterns of RSF/F-MWNT electrospun fibers indicated that the composite fibers had higher β-sheet content and crystallinity than the pure RSF electrospun fibers, respectively. The mechanical properties of the RSF electrospun fibers were improved drastically by incorporating F-MWNTs. Compared with the pure RSF electrospun fibers, the composite fibers with 1.0 wt % F-MWNTs exhibited a 2.8-fold increase in breaking strength, a 4.4-fold increase in Young's modulus, and a 2.1-fold increase in breaking energy. Cytotoxicity test preliminarily demonstrated that the electrospun fiber mats have good biocompatibility for tissue engineering scaffolds. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

0036837629	Efferent tube suspension as a continent diversion mechanism: A preliminary report of a clinical study	Purpose: We constructed a reliable continent tube that is surgically simple. Materials and Methods: In 12 patients with malignant bladder tumor we performed radical cystectomy with isolation of a 50 cm. ileal loop with pedicle. The proximal segment (8 to 10 cm.) was tapered over a 16Fr catheter as an efferent tube, the remaining segment was detubularized to create a W-shape pouch and the tapered ileum was fixed to the back surface of the rectus muscle with 2 polyester tapers 1 cm. wide with a suspension tension of 500 g. The external orifice of the tapered ileum was anastomosed to the umbilicus. In 2 patients with neuropathic bladder a 15 cm. ileal loop with pedicle was isolated, the proximal segment (8 cm.) was tapered as an efferent tube with 500 g. suspension tension, and the remaining segment was detubularized and anastomosed to the bladder. Results: The patients were followed for 6 to 17 months (mean 11.4) and were completely continent day and night. The stoma was easily catheterized with a 16Fr catheter in all cases. Urodynamic study of the efferent tubes revealed maximum pressure of 84 to 159 cm. water (mean 114). Retrograde radiography of the efferent tubes demonstrated perfect canalization without stenosis. Conclusions: This study suggests that the continent mechanism of the tapered ileum can be greatly enhanced by a suspension technique. This maneuver also provides easy catheterization and surgical simplicity.

0036864251	Urodynamic study of enhanced continent mechanism using tapered ileum as continent urinary reservoir	Objective. To investigate the effect of extramural support from the pouch and abdominal wall to enhance the continent mechanism of tapered ileum. Methods. A total of 24 patients underwent a procedure in which an ileal segment was tapered into an efferent tube, of which a part was placed between the back surface of the rectus muscle and the ileal pouch wall. The internal orifice of the tapered ileum was anastomosed to the ileal pouch and its external orifice was anastomosed to the umbilicus. A urodynamic study of the efferent tubes and pouch was done 1.5 to 3 months and 6 to 24 months postoperatively. Results. One patient died of heart disease 55 days postoperatively, while 22 of the remaining 23 were completely continent day and night. At 1.5 to 3 months, the urodynamic study of the efferent tubes demonstrated that the maximum closure pressure with a full pouch was 46 - 124 cmH

0037442051	One-stage urethral reconstruction using colonic mucosa graft: An experimental and clinical study	Aim: To investigate the possibility of urethral reconstruction with a free colonic mucosa graft and to present our preliminary experience with urethral substitution using a free graft of colonic mucosa for treatment of 7 patients with complex urethral stricture of a long segment. Methods: Ten female dogs underwent a procedure in which the urethral mucosa was totally removed and replaced with a free graft of colonic mucosa. A urodynamic study was performed before the operation and sacrifice. The dogs were sacrified 8 to 16 weeks after the operation for histological examination of urethra. Besides, 7 patients with complex urethral stricture of a long segment were treated by urethroplasty with the use of a colonic mucosal graft. The cases had undergone an average of 3 previous unsuccessful repairs. Urethral reconstruction with a free graft of colonic mucosa ranged from 10 to 17 cm (mean 13.1 cm). Follow-up included urethrography, urethroscopy and uroflowmetry. Results: Urethral stricture developed in 1 dog. The results of urodynamic studies showed that the difference in the maximum urethral pressure between the pre-operation and pre-sacrifice in the remaining 9 dogs was not of significance (P>0.05). Histological examination revealed that the colonic free mucosa survived inside the urethral lumen of the 10 experimental dogs. Plicae surface and unilaminar cylindric epithelium of the colonic mucosa was observed in dogs sacrified 8 weeks after the operation. The plicae surface and unilaminar cylindric epithelium of the colonic mucosa was not observed, and metaplastic transitional epithelium covered a large proportion of the urethral mucosa in dogs sacrificed 12 weeks after the operation. Clinically, the patients were followed up for 3-18 months postoperatively (mean 8.5 months). Meatal stenosis was developed in 1 patient 3 months postoperatively and needed reoperation. The patient was voiding very well with urinary peak flow 28.7 ml/s during the follow-up of 9 months after reoperation. The other patients were voiding well with urinary peak flow greater than 15 ml/s. Urethrogram revealed a patent urethra with an adequate lumen with no significant graft sacculation. Neither necrosis of neourethral mucosa nor stenosis at the anastomosis sites has been observed on urethroscopy in 4 patients over 6 months after operation. Conclusion: Urethral mucosa can be replaced by colonic mucosa without damaging the continence mechanism in female dogs. Colonic mucosa graft urethral substitution is a feasible procedure for the treatment of complex urethral stricture of a long segment. The technique may be considered when more conventional options have failed or are contraindicated.

84867191403	Photoselective laser vaporization of the prostate in the treatment of bladder outlet obstruction in advanced-stage prostate cancer: A single-center experience	Background and Purpose: The study in China is the first on photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) applied to bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or urinary retention from advanced-stage prostate cancer (PCa). The aim is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PVP in the treatment of patients with BOO secondary to advanced-stage PCa. Patients and Methods: Forty-five patients (mean age 76.13±5.88 years, range 62-89 years) with BOO or urinary retention secondary to advanced-stage PCa received PVP with a potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser. The treatment outcome was evaluated with subjective and objective tests at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after PVP using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QoL) score, postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume, and maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax). The operative time, indwelling catheterization time, and operative complications were also observed. Results: All 45 patients recovered without incident. The mean operative time was 50±7.6 minutes. The catheterization duration was 3.2 days (range 2-7 days). There was significant improvement in Qmax from 7.29±0.93 to 12.16±2.75mL/sec after treatment at 12 months. Mean PVR volume decreased from 210.94±179.49 to 54.45±33.16mL. Mean IPSS score decreased from preoperative 28.19±3.64 to postoperative 14.61±2.81 (P<0.05), QoL score decreased from 5.03±0.69 to 3.66±0.65 (P<0.05). There were no intraoperative adverse events. Postoperative complications included mild transient hematuria in 12 (26.7%) patients and mild dysuria in 11 (24.4%) patients within 4 weeks. Conclusions: The clinical results suggest that PVP is a safe, efficient, and less-invasive treatment for patients with BOO or urinary retention secondary to advanced-stage PCa. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84868234094	Basic research and clinical study of diagnosis and treatment of complex urethral stricture and its complications	Complex urethral stricture or obliteration is always a great challenge to most urologists. It is very difficult to treat those patients suffered from panurethral stricture or obliteration (>14 cm). To patients with previous failure in urethroplasty, the strategy selection will become a dilemma. In this field, we have obtained several original achievements in recent years. Comparing with those similar investigations in the world, many creative ideas or conceptions can be concluded in our study. Firstly, we have proved that the colonic mucosa could be an alterative material for urethroplasty. Up till now, 55 patients have undergone this procedure. The mean length of stricture in those patients was 15.2 cm. The clinic results demonstrated that the colonic mucosa has several advantages, such as abundant resource, easy to harvest, strong ability of anti-infection and low contractive rate. Therefore, this material is suitable for patients with panurethral stricture (>14 cm), especially for those with previous failure in operation. Secondly, we established the new conception of treating panurethral stricture or obliteration using three stages operation. Totally, 11 cases accepted this procedure, all of them obtained satisfied results. The strategy provides a new idea to treat patients with ultra-long segment of urethral stricture and obliteration between anterior and posterior urethra. Thirdly, we firstly described the pathologic characteristics and transformation rule of urethra in patients who accepted the lingual mucosa substitution in the world. And, we have invented the new technique to harvest the large area lingual mucosa. After that, we firstly performed the clinical lingual mucosa urethroplasty in China. With the effort over 10 years, we have collected the largest database about lingual mucosa urethroplasty in the world. Fourthly, we have established the objective quantitative criteria of urethral pressure (90 cmH

84870948098	A rationale for procedure selection to repair female urethral stricture associated with urethrovaginal fistulas	Purpose: We investigated a rationale for procedure selection to repair female urethral stricture associated with urethrovaginal fistula. We compared the outcomes of the 5 techniques used. Materials and Methods: Between January 1999 and October 2011, 44 female patients with urethral stricture associated with urethrovaginal fistula were treated using a total of 5 techniques. The surgical techniques were labial pedicle flap urethroplasty in 24 patients, vulvar flap urethroplasty in 3, anterior vaginal flap urethroplasty in 11, end-to-end anastomosis in 4 and bladder flap urethroplasty in 2. Supplementary procedures were performed in some patients during urethroplasty, including bladder neck reshaping for incontinence in 5, intestinal-vaginal fistula repair in 3, colpoplasty for island vulvar skin flaps in 3, middle vaginal stricture vaginoplasty in 2 and enlargement of the vaginal introitus in 1. Results: Average postoperative followup was 42.3 months (range 6 to 140). Urethrovaginal fistula recurred in 2 patients because of infection, urethral stricture developed in 1 and stress incontinence appeared in 1. The other patients voided normally with an average maximum urine flow greater than 15 ml per second (range 16.7 to 46). The overall anatomical success rate was 93.18% (41 of 44 cases) and the functional success rate was 90.91% (40 of 44). Conclusions: Surgical procedures for treating female urethral strictures with urethrovaginal fistulas should be based on fistula location, stricture length and vaginal anatomy. A transvaginal approach might be optimal if the vagina is wide and easily dilated. Pedicle labial flap urethroplasty was a reliable technique for complex strictures. © 2013 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

84871211864	Flexible cystoscope for evaluating pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects	Objective: To describe the value of flexible cystoscopy versus conventional urethrography (retrograde urethrography and cystourethrography) in diagnosing pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects (PFUDDs). Patients and Methods: Between May 2010 and June 2011, 120 male patients with PFUDDs were evaluated. In this study, all patients underwent conventional urethrography after admission. Flexible cystoscopy was also used for comparison, followed by conventional urethrography. The flexible cystoscope was introduced into the posterior urethra and the area was evaluated for the length of the proximal urethra and any possible fistulas, false passages, calculi or displacement of the posterior urethra. Results: Severe allergic reaction or obvious discomfort did not occur in any patients after conventional urethrography or flexible cystoscopy. By comparing the data obtained from flexible cystoscopy to those from conventional urethrography, no statistical difference was found in the measured length of the proximal posterior urethra (4.31 ± 2.28 vs. 4.02 ± 3.12, p > 0.05). However, the rate of detection in other abnormalities was higher in flexible cystoscopy than in conventional urethrography (48.3 vs. 10.8%, p < 0.05). Seventeen (14.2%), 9 (7.5%) and 32 (26.7%) patients were detected with fistula, false passage and calculus, respectively, according to flexible cystoscopy. In comparison, fistula, false passage and calculus were only observed in 2 (1.7%), 7 (5.8%) and 4 (3.3%) patients, respectively, through conventional urethrography imaging. Conclusions: Flexible cystoscopy is a valuable procedure in the evaluation of the posterior urethra and bladder neck, and in patients with urethral distraction defects before surgery. More details about fistulas, false passages, calculi and urethral defects could be obtained through this method. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84876532584	Female bladder exstrophy: Report of 2 unique cases and review of the literature	Bladder exstrophy is a rare lower urinary tract malformation that occurs less frequently in women than in men. We report 2 cases of bladder exstrophy occurring in women. One patient was an adult with congenital bladder exstrophy; the patient's bladder wall flap was used to reconstruct the neourethra after the bladder was closed using a conventional procedure. The other patient experienced lower abdominal trauma that led to widespread loss of skin and subcutaneous tissue, exposing the bladder in the lower abdominal wall. In this patient, a pedicled gracilis muscle flap was used to close the abdominal wall after the closure of the bladder. To our knowledge, the first is the fifth reported case of bladder exstrophy in an adult woman and the latter is the first reported case of bladder exstrophy caused by trauma. Both patients showed good outcomes after undergoing surgical treatment. © Postgraduate Medicine.

84878656462	Outcome of small intestinal submucosa graft for repair of anterior urethral strictures	Objectives: To investigate the feasibility of small intestinal submucosa graft for the repair of selected anterior urethral strictures. Methods: From June 2009 to May 2011, 28 men (mean age 39 years) with anterior urethral strictures underwent urethroplasty using a four-layer small intestinal submucosa patch graft in an onlay or inlay fashion. The stricture was localized to the bulbar urethra in eight patients, the bulbopenile area in nine patients and the distal penile urethra in 10 patients. Failed hypospadias was observed in one patient. The mean stricture length was 4.6cm (range 3.5-7.0cm). Results: The mean follow-up period was 24.8 months (range 12-30 months). No postoperative complications, such as infection or rejection, were related to the use of heterologous graft material. The patients voided well postoperatively, with peak flows between 16 and 44mL/s (mean 25.4mL/s) in 26 patients. Two patients (7.1%) developed a urethral narrowing; this occurred at 5 months in one patient and 6 months in the other, and cystoscopy, which was carried out at 20 and 24 weeks, respectively, showed clear cicatricial tissue at the proximal anastomotic site. Dilation was carried out once every 4-6 months for recurrent stricture in one patient and lingual mucosal graft urethroplasty was carried out in the other patient at 18 months postoperatively. Biopsies were obtained in four patients at 18, 24, 36 and 42 weeks, respectively. Squamous epithelium with or without hyperkeratosis was observed on histological examination of the small intestinal submucosa-grafted areas. Conclusions: The small intestinal submucosa matrix appears to be a safe and effective reconstructive material for selective use in urethral reconstructive surgery. © 2012 The Japanese Urological Association.

84878901157	An effective treatment for penile strangulation	The aim of this study was to present our experience of patients with penile strangulation. The clinical data of 6 patients (mean age, 36 years; range, 18-72 years) with penile strangulation caused by a metal hoop are provided, where the duration of strangulation was between 3 h and 1 month. Among these patients, the case of a 22-year-old patient with a steel hoop entrapment on his penis for 5 days is described; due to serious injury of the skin at the root of penis, an intermediate split-thickness thigh skin graft was used to repair the skin loss. A review of the literature is also provided in this study, and current treatment options and outcomes are evaluated. In all the cases described, the metal hoops were successfully removed, without gangrene of the penis. These patients were discharged 2-27 days later with a satisfactory outcome. Penile strangulation is an unusual clinical condition and the consequences may be severe. The choice of method for removal depends on the type and size of metal hoop, incarceration time, trauma grade and availability of equipment. Early treatment is essential to avoid potential complications, including ischemic necrosis and autoamputation.

84880487998	Curcumin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression of IκBα, c-Jun and androgen receptor	Curcumin possesses chemopreventive properties against several types of cancer, but the molecular mechanisms by which it induces apoptosis of cancer cells and inhibits cancer cell proliferation are not clearly understood. To evaluate the antitumor activity of curcumin for prostate cancer, we used an androgen dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line and an androgen independent PC-3 prostate cancer cell line as experimental models. We treated these cells with curcumin and then evaluated the effects of curcumin on cell cycle profiling and apoptosis, as well as the activation of NF-κB and c-jun in these cells. The results showed that the ratios of apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3 cellswere significantly elevated in a dose dependent manner after exposure to curcumin. In addition, curcumin induces the G2/M cell cycle arrest of LNCaP and PC-3 cells in a dose dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that curcumin upregulated the protein level of NF-kB inhibitor IκBα and downregulated protein levels of c-Jun and AR. These data suggest that curcumin is a promising agent for the treatment of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer. © 2013 Publishing Technology.

84880215806	Three-dimensional spiral computed tomographic cysto-urethrography for post-traumatic complex posterior urethral strictures associated with urethral-rectal fistula	To evaluate the value of three-dimensional spiral computed tomography/cysto-urethrography (CTCUG) in diagnosing posterior urethral strictures associated with urethrorectal fistulas (URF). Between June 2008 and March 2012, 38 patients with posterior urethral strictures associated with URFs were examined by CTCUG, retrograde urethrography (RUG) and cysto-urethrography (CUG). Urethral reconstruction was undertaken and URFs were surgically repaired in all patients. The length of the urethral defect, location and size of URFs were recorded. Data from radiological examinations were compared with surgical findings. No statistically significant difference was found in the length of stricture measured using CTCUG (4.31 ± 2.28 cm) or conventional urethrography (4.02 ± 3.12 cm; p > 0.05), However, the accuracy in determining the location of the stricture was higher with CTCUG (93.12%) than with conventional urethrography (70.59%; p < 0.05). CTCUG identified URFs in all 38 patients (100%), whereas URFs were only observed in 27 patients (71%) using conventional urethrography. In conclusion, CTCUG was more accurate, safer and provided more details of URFs and urethral defects than conventional urethrography in patients with posterior urethral strictures associated with URFs. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

84880224420	Imaging techniques for the diagnosis of male traumatic urethral strictures	Urethral injures, pelvic trauma, and certain congential abnormalities in male can often cause urethral strictures and scarring. Adequate and accurate imaging diagnosis of urethral strictures is critial to select a surgical approach. Although urethrography is commonly used in evaluating male urethral injury and strictures, its limitation is that the contrast offers images only at the urethral lumen but not of the periurethral structures. Sonourethrography (SUG) has the ability to define the periurethral tissues and without the radiation exposure, the degree of periurethral fibrosis can be shown with a view to guiding surgery especially in bulbar urethra. Computed tomography (CT) urethrography has the advantage of examining patients only in one position, and by generating three-dimensional images; it can accurately measure the stricture length. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide useful information in certain clinical situations, particularly posterior urethral trauma and in the evaluation of the periurethral soft tissues. However, both CT and MRI are relative high cost. The selection of imaging methods should depend on the etiology, sites, patient's general condition and the type of urethral injury, using a rational combination of different imaging methods can improve the accuracy of diagnosis for traumatic urethral strictures. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

84880844779	Recurrence and complications after transperineal bulboprostatic anastomosis for posterior urethral strictures resulting from pelvic fracture: A retrospective study from a urethral referral centre	Objective To describe the complications of transperineal end-to-end anastomotic urethroplasty in patients with posterior urethral strictures resulting from pelvic fracture. Materials and Methods A total of 573 patients, who underwent bulboprostatic anastomosis for posterior urethral strictures, were enrolled in this study. Distraction defects were measured using retrograde urethrography combined with voiding cysto-urethrography. All patients underwent perineal excision and primary anastomotic urethroplasty. The urethroplasty was considered successful if the patient was free of stricture-related obstruction and did not require any further intervention. The degree of stress incontinence was assessed daily by pad testing. The prevalence of pre- and postoperative sexual disorders was investigated using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 questionnaire. Results Of 573 bulboprostatic anastomosis procedures performed, 504 (88%) were successful and 69 (12%) were not successful. The mean (sd) maximum urinary flow rate, assessed by uroflowmetry 4 weeks after surgery, was 20.52 (5.1) mL/s. Intraoperative rectal injury was repaired primarily in 28 cases. Recurrence of urethral strictures was observed in 10 (1.7%) patients during the first 6 months after surgery, and in 45 patients from 6 months to 1 year. All of these patients underwent re-operation. Twenty-four (4.2%) patients had mild urge incontinence and 28 (4.9%) had mild stress incontinence. Erectile dysfunction (ED) was present in two (<0.1%) patients before trauma and in 487 (85%) patients after trauma. There was no statistical difference between the incidences of preoperative and postoperative ED (85 vs 86%, P > 0.05). Nine (1%) patients were found to have false passage between the posterior urethra and bladder neck. Conclusion The majority of complications associated with transperineal bulboprostatic anastomosis can be avoided as long as meticulous preoperative evaluation to define the anatomy and careful intra-operative manipulation are ensured. © 2013 BJU International.

84881087099	The relationship between erectile dysfunction and open urethroplasty: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Introduction: Various urethroplasty techniques have been used to treat urethral stricture. Whether the patient erectile function is affected by this open surgery is still controversial. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the relationship between erectile function and open urethroplasty. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using Medline, Embase, the Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases through October 2012 to identify articles published in any language that examined the effect of open urethroplasty on the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED). This meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines for the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology. Main Outcome Measures: The incidence of ED after urethroplasty. Results: This meta-analysis consisted of 23 cohort studies, which included 1,729 cases. No significant difference was noticed in patients with anterior urethral stricture before or after intervention (odds ratio [OR]=0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52-1.40; P=0.53). While statistical difference in the incidence of ED was revealed in patients before and after intervention for a posterior urethral (OR=2.51; 95% CI: 1.82-3.45; P<0.001), further comparisons demonstrated that most anterior urethroplasties did not have an obvious effect on patient erectile function. However, it seems that the incidence of ED was higher in the bulbar anastomosis group than in the oral graft urethroplasty group (OR=0.32 95% CI: 0.11-0.93; P=0.04). For the posterior urethroplasty, previous operative history did not show a strong relationship with ED. No statistically significant difference in the risk of ED was demonstrated comparing the posterior urethral reconstructive techniques included in this analysis. Conclusion: The adverse effect of urethroplasty itself on erectile function is limited, as more patients recover erectile function after urethral reconstruction. For anterior urethroplasty, bulbar anastomosis might cause a slightly higher incidence of ED than other operations. For posterior urethroplasty, trauma might be the main cause of ED. © 2013 International Society for Sexual Medicine.

84883893970	Evaluation of stretched electrospun silk fibroin matrices seeded with urothelial cells for urethra reconstruction	Background: We investigated the feasibility of urethral reconstruction using stretched electrospun silk fibroin matrices. Materials and methods: A novel electrospun silk fibroin matrix was prepared. The structure of the material was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and a porosity test. Canine urothelial cells were isolated, expanded, and seeded onto the material for 1 wk to obtain a tissue-engineered graft. The tissue-engineered graft was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy. A dorsal urethral mucosal defect was created in nine female beagle dogs. In the experimental group, tissue-engineered mucosa was used to repair urethra mucosa defects in six dogs. No substitute was used in the three dogs of the control group. Retrograde urethrography was performed at 1, 2, and 6 mo after grafting. The urethral grafts were analyzed grossly and histologically. Results: Scanning electron microscope and a porosity test revealed that the material had a three-dimensional porous structure. Urothelial cells grew on the material and showed good biocompatibility with the stretched silk fibroin matrices. Canines implanted with tissue-engineered mucosa voided without difficulty. Retrograde urethrography revealed no signs of stricture. Histologic staining showed gradual epithelial cell development and stratified epithelial layers at 1, 2, and 6 mo. The canines in the control group showed difficulty in voiding. Retrograde urethrography showed urethra stricture. Histologic staining showed that no or only one layer of epithelial cells developed. A severe inflammatory reaction was also observed in the control group. Conclusions: Stretched electrospun silk fibroin matrices have good biocompatibility with urothelial cells, which could prove to be a potential material for use in urethra reconstruction. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84891274772	Outcome of 1-stage urethroplasty using oral mucosal grafts for the treatment of urethral strictures associated with genital lichen sclerosus	Objective To report the outcome of 1-stage urethroplasty using lingual mucosal grafts (LMGs) and buccal mucosal grafts (BMGs) for the treatment of male urethral strictures associated with genital lichen sclerosus (LS). Materials and Methods This was a descriptive, observational retrospective study of male patients with urethral strictures who underwent 1-stage mucosal graft urethroplasty using different substitute materials for reconstructive urethral surgery. Study inclusion criteria were patients with histologically proven LS presenting with urethral strictures. Exclusion criteria were patients without histologically proven LS, traumatic strictures, failed hypospadias, and malignant lesions. Successful reconstruction was defined as normal voiding with a peak flow >12 mL/s, no obstructive symptoms, and no postoperative procedure, including dilation. Results Between January 2003 and December 2011, urethral strictures in 54 patients were considered associated with genital LS according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 36 underwent 1-stage urethroplasty using oral mucosal grafts. The median age was 52 years (range, 32-80 years). The median stricture length was 12.5 ± 1.6 cm (range, 6-18 cm). One-stage single-sided dorsal LMG urethroplasty was performed in 22 of 36 patients. The remaining 14 patients received the same procedure combined with dual BMGs (n = 5) or with LMG combined with BMG (n = 9). The success rate was 88.9%. Postoperative urinary fistula occurred in 1 patient, and meatal stenosis developed in 3 patients. Mean follow-up was 38.7 months (range, 12-110 months). Conclusion Our survey suggests that 1-stage urethroplasty with single or combined LMGs or BMGs may be an effective option to treat urethral stricture associated with LS.

84892383338	Continued sustained release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheres modified BAMG stent for the anterior urethral reconstruction of rabbit	Objective: To study the biocompatibility and neovascularization of the PLGA nanospheres wrapped with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can improve bladder acellular matrix graft (BAMG) with local continuous release of VEGF. Methods: A total of 18 rabbit model (length of stenosis: 3cm) with anterior urethral stricture were used as experimental animals and divided into three groups. Group A as the control group: Simple BAMG scaffold materials for urethral reconstruction. Group B as the blank group: PLGA microspheres modified BAMG for urethral reconstruction. Group C: PLGA conjugated with VEGF and modified BAMG for the urethral reconstruction. All rabbits underwent urethral angiography after 7 days, 15 days, 1 month and 3 months after the operation, and one rabbit in each group was sacrificed to be prepared for the organization histologic examination, HE staining, masson staining, CD31, 34 and a-SAM immunohistochemical detection in the repaired sites. Results: In group A, significant urethral restenosis occurred in two rabbits after 15 days of the operation, HE and masson staining showed a lot of collagen arranged in the repaired sites, and there were a large number of inflammatory cell infiltration, and there were also CD31, 34 in the repaired sites. a-SAM microvascular tag count showed a small amount of microvascular; Group B showed anastomotic restenosis, HE and masoon staining showed inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition; Group C: urethrography showed lumen patency. There were a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration after 7 and 15 days after the operation, and there were also CD31, 34 in the repaired sites. The a-SAM microvascular tag count showed many microvascular. And the difference was significant. Conclusions: Anterior urethral reconstruction with sustained-release of VEGF by PLGA nanospheres modified BAMG stents can reduce postoperative restenosis. It can also reduce collagen deposition and scar formation, promote angiogenesis of the repair tissue; therefore it in valuable in the tissue-engineered urethral reconstruction. © 2013 Hainan Medical College.

84894132588	Epithelial-differentiated adipose-derived stem cells seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts for urethral reconstruction: An animal model	The limited amount of available epithelial tissue is considered a main cause of the high rate of urethral reconstruction failures. The aim of this study was to investigate whether epithelial-differentiated rabbit adipose-derived stem cells (Epith-rASCs) could play a role of epithelium in vivo functionally and be a potential substitute of urothelium. Substitution urethroplasty was performed to repair an anterior urethral defect in male New Zealand rabbits using Epith-rASCs seeded bladder acellular matrix grafts (BAMGs) after 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling, based on the in vitro epithelial induction system we previously described. Urethroplasty with cell-free BAMGs and with undifferentiated rASCs (Und-rASCs) seeded BAMGs were performed as controls. After surgery, a notable amelioration of graft contracture and recovery of urethral continuity were observed in the Epith-rASCs/BAMG group by retrograde urethrograms and macroscopic inspection. Immunofluorescence revealed that the BrdU-labeled Epith-rASCs/Und-rASCs colocalized with cytokeratin 13 or myosin. Consistent with the results of western blotting, at early postimplantation stage, the continuous epithelial layer with local multilayered structure was observed in the Epith-rASCs/BAMG group, whereas no significant growth and local monolayer growth profile of epithelial cells were observed in the BAMG and Und-rASCs/BAMG group, respectively. The results showed that Epith-rASCs could serve as a potential substitute of urothelium for urethral tissue engineering and be available to prevent lumen contracture and subsequent complications including recurrent stricture. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84897397169	Tissue-engineered buccal mucosa using silk fibroin matrices for urethral reconstruction in a canine model	Background To investigate the feasibility of urethral reconstruction using tissue-engineered buccal mucosa (TEBM) with silk fibroin (SF) matrices in a canine model. Materials and methods Autologous oral keratinocytes and autologous fibroblasts were isolated, expanded, and seeded onto SF matrices to obtain TEBM. The TEBM was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy. A 5-cm urethral mucosal defect was created in 10 female canines. Urethroplasty was performed using TEBM in five canines in the experimental group and with SF matrices without cells in the five canines in the comparison group. Retrograde urethrography was performed after 6 mo of grafting. The urethral grafts were analyzed grossly and histologically. Results The oral keratinocytes and fibroblasts exhibited good biocompatibility with the SF matrices. TEBM could be constructed using SF matrices. The canines implanted with the tissue-engineered mucosa voided without difficulty. The retrograde urethrography revealed no sign of stricture. The histologic staining showed that epithelial cells developed gradually and exhibited stratified epithelial layers at 6 mo. In the comparison group, the canines had difficulty voiding, and the retrograde urethrography showed urethra stricture. The histologic staining showed that one to two layers of epithelial cells developed. Conclusions The TEBM using SF matrices could be a potential material for urethra reconstruction. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84896909256	Pedicled rectus abdominis muscle and fascia flap sling the bulbar urethra for treatment for male-acquired urinary incontinence: Report of ten cases	Purpose: Male urinary incontinence is relatively common complication of radical prostatectomy and of posterior urethroplasty following traumatic pelvic fracture. Here, we investigate the use of pedicled rectus abdominis muscle and fascia flap sling of the bulbar urethra for treatment for male-acquired urinary incontinence. Materials and methods: Ten patients with acquired urinary incontinence were included in the study. Urinary incontinence was secondary to TURP in three patients and was secondary to posterior urethroplasty performed following traumatic pelvic fracture in seven patients. Pedicled rectus abdominalis muscle and fascial flaps, approximately 2.5 cm wide and 15 cm long, were isolated. The flaps were inserted into a perineal incision through a subcutaneous tunnel. The free end of the flap was sectioned to form two muscle strips, each 3 cm in length, and inserted into the space between bulbar urethra and corpus cavernosa. After adequate sling tension had been achieved, the two strips of muscle were anastomosed around the bulbar urethra using a 2-zero polyglactin suture. Results: The patients were followed up for between 12 and 82 months (mean 42.8 months). Complete continence was achieved with good voiding in seven of the 10 patients. In other three patients achieved good voiding following catheter removal, but incontinence was only moderately improved. Conclusions: A pedicled rectus muscle fascial sling of the bulbar urethra is an effective and safe treatment for male patients with mild to moderate acquired urinary incontinence, but it may not be suitable for severe incontinence or for patients with weak rectus abdominalis muscles. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.

84901189848	In situ fabrication of a microporous bacterial cellulose/potato starch composite scaffold with enhanced cell compatibility	Microporous bacterial cellulose/potato starch (BC/PS) composites composed of a compact upper surface and transparent lower surface were fabricated by an in situ method by adding PS into the culture medium. The special structure formation mechanism was explored. Compared with original BC, a locally oriented surface morphology was observed when the concentration of PS in the culture media was above 1.0 %. Many more free spaces were made after modification with pore size reaching 40 μm. An obvious cell ingrowth tendency was observed on the porous surface of BC/PS composites as the starch content increased, while most of muscle-derived cells could only proliferate on the surface of original BCs. In vivo implantation showed the transparent fibrous lower side of BC/PS composites was much easier for neovascularization, and no obvious sign of inflammation was observed. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84901758584	Tunable structures and properties of electrospun regenerated silk fibroin mats annealed in water vapor at different times and temperatures	Regenerated silk fibroin (SF) mats were fabricated using electrospinning technique, followed by mild water vapor annealing to effectively tune the structures and improve the mechanical properties of the mats at different annealing times and temperatures. The breaking strength and the breaking energy of the mats treated with water vapor at 65°C for 12 h reached 6.0 MPa and 171.7 J/kg, respectively. The conformational transition of the SF mats was significantly influenced by the treating temperature, while the influence of time was comparatively limited. The influence is consistent with the time-temperature equivalent principle and would be helpful for the preparation of water-vapor-annealed silk-based biomaterials for various applications. © 2014 Xiangyu Huang et al.

84903749837	CT virtual cystourethroscopy for complex urethral strictures: An investigative, descriptive study	Purpose: To compare the values of CT virtual cystourethroscopy and of conventional cystourethroscopy in diagnosing complex urethral strictures. Methods: From January 2012 to December 2012, 33 patients, suspected of having complex urethral strictures before operation, were enrolled in this study. After CT scanning, a virtual cystourethroscopic view was softwaregenerated. Conventional cystourethroscopy was also used before operation. The time durations of virtual cystourethroscopy and conventional cystourethroscopy were recorded. The accuracies of both techniques were compared using the actual findings from the operation. Results: For 16 patients suffering from urethral strictures associated with various fistulas, the duration of examination with virtual cystourethroscopy was statistically significantly shorter than with conventional cystourethroscopy (P < 0.001). The detection rate of fistula by virtual cystourethroscopy was similar to than by conventional cystourethroscopy (P = 0.057). The same results were obtained in eight patients suffering from urethral strictures associated with false passages. Only virtual cystourethroscopy could reveal the details of the urethral lumen in nine patients suffering from long anterior urethral strictures caused by lichen sclerosus. By contrast, conventional cystourethroscopy failed in those same patients. Conclusion: CT virtual cystourethroscopy is a useful technique for the diagnosis of urethral disease, especially in male patients suffering from complex urethral strictures. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

84903396038	Electrocautery-induced cavernous nerve injury in rats that mimics radical prostatectomy in humans	Objective To investigate the early and delayed effects of cavernous nerve electrocautery injury (CNEI) in a rat model, with the expectation that this model could be used to test rehabilitation therapies for erectile dysfunction (ED) after radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and Methods In all, 30 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided equally into two groups (15 per group). The control group received CNs exposure surgery only and the experimental group received bilateral CNEI. At 1, 4 and 16 weeks after surgery (five rats at each time point), the ratio of maximal intracavernosal pressure (ICP) to mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured in the two groups. Neurofilament expression in the dorsal penile nerves was assessed by immunofluorescent staining and Masson's trichrome staining was used to assess the smooth muscle to collagen ratio in both groups. Results At the 1-week follow-up, the mean ICP/MAP was significantly lower in the CNEI group compared with the control group, at 9.94% vs 70.06% (P < 0.05). The mean ICP/MAP in the CNEI group was substantially increased at the 4- (35.97%) and 16-week (37.11%) follow-ups compared with the 1-week follow-up (P < 0.05). At all three follow-up time points, the CNEI group had significantly decreased neurofilament staining compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Also, neurofilament expressions in the CNEI group at both 4 and 16 weeks were significantly higher than that at 1 week (P < 0.05), but there was no difference between 4 and 16 weeks (P > 0.05). The smooth muscle to collagen ratio in the CNEI group was significantly lower than in the control group at the 4- and 16-week follow-ups (P < 0.05), and the ratio at 16 weeks was further reduced compared with that at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). Conclusions In the CNEI rat model, we found the damaging effects of CNEI were accompanied by a decline in ICP, reduced numbers of nerve fibres in the dorsal penile nerve, and exacerbated fibrosis in the corpus cavernosum. This may provide a basis for studying potential preventative measures or treatment strategies to ameliorate ED caused by CNEI during RP. © 2013 BJU International.

84906900190	Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome in juveniles and adults with female phenotypes	Aim To report on six cases of the diagnosis and treatment of patients with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) and a review of the relevant published work. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on the clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of a total of six patients with CAIS who were admitted to our hospital between September 1985 and June 2012. All surgical patients were examined for sex chromosomes and sex hormone levels pre- and postoperatively, respectively, and underwent lower abdominal B ultrasounds and pathological examinations among other tests. Results Five of the patients were treated with castration, one patient aged 5 years was treated conservatively Tissue from surgical resections showed normal testicular tissue that comprised Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, and pathological examinations showed no sign of testicular cancer. Following corrective operations, postoperative complications, such as female secondary sexual characteristics, stagnation and osteoporosis, have not developed. Sex hormone level ratio changed significantly after being treated with castration compared with preoperative levels; mainly testosterone and estrogen decreased significantly (P < 0.05), while luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone significantly increased (P < 0.05). However, prolactin did not change significantly (P > 0.05). Conclusion The study show that removal of the testes in CAIS patients after puberty is safe and reliable. Meanwhile, it is essential to provide a hormone drug after being treated with castration. Further studies are needed to evaluate the safety and the quality of life for CAIS patients. © 2014 The Authors.

84909954359	Application of bacterial cellulose in tissue engineering	Background: Because of unique physiochemical and mechanical properties and good biocompatibility and degradability, bacterial cellulose, a nanofiber, has a potential as an ideal tissue-engineered material. Objective: To retrospectively analyze the application of bacterial cellulose in tissue engineering. Methods: The first author researched PubMed and CNKI databases (2004/2013) to retrieve articles about application of bacterial cellulose in tissue engineering. The keywords were "bacterial cellulose; tissue engineering" in English and Chinese, respectively. Totally 48 relevant articles were analyzed. Results And Conclusion: Bacterial cellulose has unique properties, such as, high crystallinity, high mechanical strength, high water holding capacity, biodegradation, biocompatibility and three-dimensional nano network. In addition, bacterial cellulose can maintain biological activity of bioactive factors as a carrier. At last, modified bacterial cellulose can improve its mechanical and biological properties, and promote the repair and reconstruction of the tissue and organ. Currently, bacterial cellulose has been used in tissue and organ reconstruction. Bacterial cellulose as a carrier for bioactive molecules is difficult to degrade and has disadvantages of single function, which can be modified to improve its function and degradation.

84916227145	The utility of fluorescence in situ hybridization for diagnosis and surveillance of bladder urothelial carcinoma	Purpose: To evaluate the clinical value of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for diagnosis and surveillance of bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC). Materials and Methods: Between November 2010 and December 2013, patients suspected of having BUC were examined using urine cytology and FISH assay. Based on histopathological examination results, FISH results were compared with urine cytology. In addition, patients with a history of non-muscle invasive BUC were also examined using urine cytology and FISH assay at the first time of visit and then monitored with cystoscopy during follow-up period. Results: A total of 162 patients included in this study and 12 patients were excluded due to uninformative FISH assays. The remaining 150 patients consisted of 108 patients suspected for BUC and 42 patients with a history of non-muscle invasive BUC. The sensitivities of FISH analysis and urine cytology were 72.8% and 27.2%, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P <.05). Difference between specificity of urine cytology (100%) and FISH assay (85%) was not statistically significant (P >.05). At the first visit, of 42 patients, one patient had positive cystoscopy, and FISH assay was positive in 26 of 41 patients with negative cystoscopy. During the follow-up period (mean, 29.5 months), 18 of 26 patients developed recurrence, and recurrence occurred in only one of 15 patients with negative FISH analysis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that FISH analysis can be used as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for patients suspected of having new BUC. In addition, FISH analysis may provide important prognostic information to better define the individual risk for BUC recurrence.

0347479285	1-Stage urethral reconstruction using colonic mucosa graft for the treatment of a long complex urethral stricture	Purpose: We investigated the possibility of urethroplasty with a free graft of colonic mucosa for long, complex urethral strictures. We report our initial experience with colonic mucosa graft urethroplasty for such urethral strictures in 16 patients. Materials and Methods: Between September 2000 and December 2002, 16 patients with a long, complex urethral stricture were treated with colonic mucosal graft urethroplasty. Patients had undergone an average of 2.5 previous unsuccessful repairs. Urethral reconstruction was done with a 10 to 17 cm (median 13) graft of colonic mucosa Results: Patients were followed 6 to 33 months postoperatively. Meatal stenosis that developed in 1 patient 3 months postoperatively needed reoperation. The patient was voiding well with a urinary peak flow of 28.7 ml per second during 9-month followup after reoperation. Hyperplasia of the verumontanum was observed during urethroscopy and transurethral colliculectomy was performed in 1 patient more than 14 months postoperatively. Uroflowmetry showed a urinary peak flow of 46.5 ml per second postoperatively. The other patients were voiding well with a urinary peak flow of greater than 15 ml per second. Urethrogram revealed a patent urethra with an adequate lumen and no significant graft sacculation. Conclusions: This initial experience in 16 patients indicates that colonic mucosa graft urethroplasty is a feasible procedure for long, complex anterior urethral strictures. The technique may be considered for urethral reconstruction when more conventional procedures have failed.

84922409556	Reconstruction of penile urethra with the 3-dimensional porous bladder acellular matrix in a rabbit model	Objective To evaluate the effect of reconstruction of penile urethra with the 3-dimensional (3-D) porous bladder acellular matrix (BAM) in a rabbit model. Materials and Methods In 30 male rabbits, a ventral urethral mucosal defect (1.5 × 0.8 cm) was created. Substitution urethroplasty was performed with 5% peracetic acid (PAA)-treated BAM (3-D porous BAM; 15 rabbits, PAA-treated BAM group) and non - PAA-treated BAM (15 rabbits; non-PAA-treated BAM group) in an onlay fashion. At 1, 2, and 3 months after surgery (5 rabbits at each time point) in the 2 groups, retrograde urethrogram and histologic analysis were performed to evaluate the outcomes of urethroplasty. Results In the PAA-treated BAM group, 13 rabbits maintained a wide urethral caliber without a fistula or stricture. In contrast, 10 rabbits kept a wide caliber in the non - PAA-treated BAM group. Histologically, at 1, 2, and 3 months after the surgery, the speed of urothelium regeneration in the PAA-treated BAM group was faster than that in the non - PAA-treated BAM group. The smooth muscle-to-collagen ratio and the content of smooth muscle in the PAA-treated BAM group were significantly higher than that in the non - PAA-treated BAM group at each time point (P <.05). The endothelium density between the non - PAA-treated BAM and the PAA-treated BAM groups revealed a significant increase at all 3 time points (P <.05). Conclusion Our results confirmed that PAA-treated BAM urethroplasty enhanced urothelium, smooth muscle regeneration and neovascularization compared with those of the non - PAA-treated BAM. The 3-D porous BAM as an optimized biological scaffold may be used for cell-based tubular and long-segmental urethral reconstruction in the future.
