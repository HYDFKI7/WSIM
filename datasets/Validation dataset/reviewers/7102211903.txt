1642602769	Analysis of subcritical and supercritical Hopf bifurcation for balanced Jeffcott rotor bearing system	The sub- and supercritical Hopf bifurcation of balanced rotor-bearing system was investigated using the nonlinear dynamics theory. A numerical method was suggested for analyzing rotor system's sub- and supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The instability speed limit versus eccentricity ratio was obtained for different bearing aspect ratios, and the regions corresponding to sub-and supercritical Hopf bifurcation were determined. The simulation results show that there is a gradual transition from stability to instability for supercritical bifurcation and no gradual transition exists for subcritical bifurcation. It can be seen that smaller bearing aspect ratio is more helpful to prevent from the dangerous subcritical Hopf bifurcation.

36248930980	Research on improved magnetorheological damper for wide-band vibration control	Magnetorheological (MR) damper is a new smart device utilized in semi-active vibration control, which has less response time, greater damping force and is easy to control. But common MR damper can't be used in cases of high-frequency vibrations because of stiffness hardening, which leads to increase of displacement transmissibility at high frequencies. For this reason a new MR damper with decoupling mechanism is designed by adding decoupling mechanism into the common MR damper. The decoupling mechanism made the damper sensitive to vibration. This means that the damper has different stiffness and damping in case of different amplitude. Based on the Bingham fluid theory, model of present MR damper has been built, and transmissibility expression of the isolation system has been proposed. Dynamic characteristics have been emulated. The results show that the decoupling sheet doesn't work in case of low frequency and large amplitude vibration, and the damper presents high damping. In case of high frequency and small amplitude vibration, the decoupling sheet works and the damper presents small damping and stiffness. As a result, transmissibility at high frequencies decreased.

In this paper, methods based on GAs have been developed and presented for design optimization of journal bearings in nonlinear rotor system. The GA uses a 30-bit chromosome to represent the bearing radial clearance, aspect ratio and lubricant viscosity, with 10-bit for each design variable. The instability onset speed of the system is taken as the fitness function in GA, in which the nonlinear effects of the bearing fluid forces are considered. The instability onset speed is defined in two different cases, that is, periodic and quasi-periodic or chaotic motions. To verify the effectiveness of the suggested method, a rigid rotor-bearing system is taken as an example to be optimized. The different crossover probabilities, mutation probabilities and population sizes are employed to analyze their influences on GA so that a set of appropriate parameters are chosen to be used in the final calculation.

44849101459	Research on dynamic characteristics of a magnetorheological damper with decoupling mechanism	Satellites are subject to severe vibrations during flight. These vibrations are induced by multiple sources during liftoff and the instant of final separation. Severe vibrations may cause damage to satellites. For this reason a payload adaptor is needed. Magnetorheological (MR) damper can be utilized to keep the satellites safe. But the common MR damper can't be used in cases of high-frequency vibrations because of stiffness hardening. For this reason, a new MR damper with decoupling mechanism has been designed by adding a decoupling sheet to the common MR damper. The decoupling mechanism makes the damper sensitive to vibration. This means that the damper has different stiffness and damping in case of different vibration amplitude. Based on the Bingham model, the model of the suggested MR damper has been built, and mathematical formulas has been deduced for dynamic stiffness, delay angle and transmissibility of the damper. Dynamic characteristics have been simulated. The results show that the decoupling sheet doesn't work in case of low frequency and high amplitude vibration and the damper presents high damping. In case of high frequency and low amplitude vibration, the decoupling sheet works and the damper presents small damping and stiffness. Thus the stiffness hardening has been avoided.

44849126675	A new composite vibration isolator for gearbox found in large vessels	Gearboxes are important sources of vibration and noise in large vessels. Severe vibration induced by the gearbox may cause damage and stealth failure, and wave load and explosion transmitted to the gearbox may destroy it and cut power of vessels. For this reason a new mount has been designed with special emphasis on these harmful vibrations. The mount is a hollow annular box consisted of small rib-supported boxes, which is made from composite laminates and visco-elastic materials. Every small box works like a cantilever. So, the vertical component of structural stiffness is tunable via modifying the length or section of cantilever. The directional stiffness of this mount can be changed simply by changing the fiber direction too. The ribs have relative movement because of vibrations of the mount. Then the constrained layer damping between one pair of ribs generates damping force. With the help of an additional damping device, the vibration energy can be absorbed. So, the natural frequencies and ratio of the first two modal frequencies can be changed easily. Finite element analysis has been applied to confirm its dynamic and static performance. The results prove that the proposed isolator is effective in vibration isolation for the gearbox with less additional weight or space requirement Copyright © 2007 by ASME.

Mathematical expressions of dynamic characteristics, including dynamic stiffness, delay angle, force transmission rate and dynamic range of damping force, are deducted by solving the models. Numerical simulations are used to study the dynamic characteristics. The results indicate that, the design produces large damping force in the low frequency high amplitude case and small damping force low stiffness in the opposite case. The high frequency stiffness hardening is avoided. This MR damper can be used to semi-active vibration control of vehicles.

84863563620	Nonlinear flutter response of tilting 4 pad bearings-rotor system	Nonlinear analysis is increasingly applied in the dynamics analysis of rotor bearing systems. The use of tilting-pad bearings is now a standard feature of many types of rotor systems. The concern for oil film excitation of the rotor lowest natural frequency is eliminated by the use of the tilting pad journal bearings. For new higher speed or larger low speed applications, the possibility of the pad flutter instability still remains and most commonly used design tools do not consider the pad inertia as a standard feature. In this paper, taking the Jeffcott rotor supported by two 4 pad bearings as an example, the influence of pad inertia and journal diameter were studied. The influence of shaft diameter and pad inertia was determined by the transient response of a simple rotor-bearing system operating over a wide design speed range. The tilting pad journal bearing oil-film force was calculated by a database method. The resulting nonlinear transient vibration is discussed using bifurcation diagrams, orbits, frequency spectrum plots, phase trajectories, and Poincare maps. The results directly show that journal diameter and pad inertia greatly influence the nonlinear vibrations of the journal and rotor center. © 2011 by ASME.

84863593942	An analytical study of the effect of different eccentricity and whirling speed on labyrinth seal forces and dynamics parameters	Modeling and calculation are performed for labyrinth seal-rotor system by using numerical methods and commercial CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The time spent for computer calculation, pressure distribution in flow field and labyrinth seal forces under five different eccentricities and whirling speeds are researched, respectively. The effects on labyrinth seal leakage and dynamics parameters are also studied by numerical methods. The results show that the method can preferably simulate labyrinth seal leakage and dynamics parameters under different conditions. It gets that pressure and labyrinth seal force increase with eccentricity, and tangential labyrinth seal force increase with eccentricity and whirling speed, while its normal one does in negative direction. Leakage influencing change rate of seal length and gap, sealing pressure difference are 6.62%, 65.21% and 69.97%, respectively, indicating that seals gap and its pressure difference are important impact factors to leakage. Increasing labyrinth seal pressure difference and seal length is not beneficial to seal-rotor system stability, while increasing the seal gap would be good for it.

It's shown that the curve squeal noise which results from the self-excited vibration is mainly due to the difference of friction coefficient in the contact surface. If the wheel's modal damping is larger than the critical value of equivalent damping, the contact system will be stable. The vertical stiffness and damping in wheel-rail contact can make the unstable frequency shift slightly from the natural frequency.

84872578353	Establishment and analysis of time domain model in wheel-rail lateral contact	To study the influence of wheel-rail lateral contact stability on the curve squeal noise, the time domain model of wheel-rail lateral contact system is established based on the wheel's lateral and vertical dynamic analysis. The friction force in the wheel-rail contact surface is calculated by a new improved friction coefficient model. The effects of the wheel's lateral creepage and damping on the stability of contact system are analyzed about the monobloc steel wheel with S-web. It's shown that the curve squeal noise is mainly due to the self-excited vibration of stick-slip motion caused by the difference between the static and the kinetic friction force in the contact surface. If the wheel's modal damping is larger than the critical value of equivalent damping, or the value of lateral creepage is less than 0.0024, the contact system will be stable. The vertical stiffness and the damping of the wheel-rail contact system can make the unstable frequency shift slightly from the wheel's natural frequency.

The cross section deformation of the rail and the effect of its understructure were also considered. The stability of wheel-rail contact system was analyzed in the case of different contact positions and modal damping ratio of the wheel. It is shown that the wheel mode with zero nodal circle has the most obvious effect on the stability of contact system. The increment of lateral creepage can lead the contact system to become unstable, and the effect of creepage is more obvious in flange contact than tread one. The effect of contact position depends on the yaw angle of the rail and the friction coefficient in contact area. The increment of wheel damping can decrease the number of unstable frequency, and the effect of damping is more obvious in flange contact under large yaw angle.

84872797194	Study of impact factor on dynamics parameters of the floating ring bearing for micro gas turbogenerator	Floating ring bearings (FRBs) are widely used in high speed rotating machines. In this paper, the carrying capacity of outer oil film, which can represent the total capacity of FRBs, in floating-ring bearing was analyzed only because the bearing capacity of inner oil film is larger than that of the outer one. Based on the rotordynamic DyRoBes software and finite difference method, the pressure of outer oil film in relatively heavy load micro gas turbogenerator was computed and the results were analysed and compared. Because of the structural characteristics of FRBs , the relationship of stiffness and damping of inner and outer films is equivalent to the series of spring and damper, thus the total stiffness and damping of FRB could be calculated under different rotation speeds. The important parameters, such as eccentricity ratio, static balance position, which give the influences on the oil film characteristics and rotordynamic behavior were also studied. At last, the stability of oil film was determined using Routh-Hurwitz criterion.

84881412591	Optimum layout of passive constrained layer damping treatment using genetic algorithms	The passive constrained layer damping (CLD) treatments have been used widely for vibration suppression of various flexible structures. Fully covered CLD treatment is extensively used to depress the vibration over a wide frequency range in engineering applications. In most of these treatments it is required that the CLD treatment should not significantly increase the weight or volume. This paper focuses on damping optimization of fully coating beam with a constrained viscoelastic layer. The governing equation of motion of a CLD covered beam is derived using an energy approach and Lagrange's method. The assumed modes method is employed in solving the equation to obtain the modal loss factors which are used as the objective of optimal layout. A genetic algorithm with large-scale mutation method is employed to search for the optima of the thicknesses of both the constraining layer (CL) and the viscoelastic layer (VL) and the shear modulus of the viscoelastic material (VEM) with the restriction of added volume of the total CLD treatment. Numerical results show that the optima of three design variables, the thicknesses of the CL and the VL and the shear modulus of its viscoelastic material, are highly relevant to each other. The softer or thinner constraining layer requires a softer viscoelastic material for an optimal damping treatment, and high value of the elastic modulus of the base beam matches high shear modulus of the viscoelastic material. The variation of the CL thickness decreases slowly and that of the VL thickness increases with the increase of the thickness of the CLD treatment. Stiffer constraining layer assure greater modal loss factors.© 2010 by ASME.
