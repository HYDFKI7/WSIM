26944436705	Production of i mesons at midrapidity in sNN=200GeVAu+Au collisions at relativistic energies	We present the results of I meson production in the K+K- decay channel from Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV as measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX detector at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Precision resonance centroid and width values are extracted as a function of collision centrality. No significant variation from the Particle Data Group accepted values is observed, contrary to some model predictions. The I transverse mass spectra are fitted with a linear exponential function for which the derived inverse slope parameter is seen to be constant as a function of centrality. However, when these data are fitted by a hydrodynamic model the result is that the centrality-dependent freeze-out temperature and the expansion velocity values are consistent with the values previously derived from fitting identified charged hadron data. As a function of transverse momentum the collisions scaled peripheral-to-central yield ratio RCP for the I is comparable to that of pions rather than that of protons. This result lends support to theoretical models that distinguish between baryons and mesons instead of particle mass for explaining the anomalous (anti) proton yield. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

26944449335	Measurement of single electron event anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The transverse momentum dependence of the azimuthal anisotropy parameter v2, the second harmonic of the azimuthal distribution, for electrons at midrapidity (|η|<0.35) has been measured with the PHENIX detector in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The measurement was made with respect to the reaction plane defined at high rapidities (|η|=3.1-3.9). From the result we have measured the v2 of electrons from heavy flavor decay after subtraction of the v2 of electrons from other sources such as photon conversions and Dalitz decay from light neutral mesons. We observe a nonzero single electron v2 with a 90% confidence level in the intermediate-pT region. The precision of the present data set does not permit us to conclude definitively that heavy quarks exhibit thermalization with the transverse flow of the bulk matter. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27144460964	Jet structure of baryon excess in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Two particle correlations between identified meson and baryon trigger particles with 2.5<pT<4.0GeV/c and lower pT charged hadrons have been measured at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. In noncentral Au+Au collisions, the probability of finding a hadron near in azimuthal angle to the trigger particles is almost identical for mesons and baryons and significantly higher than in p+p collisions. The associated yields for trigger baryons decrease in the most central collisions, consistent with some baryon production by thermal recombination in addition to hard scattering. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

27744533945	Saturation of azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62-200GeV	New measurements are presented for charged hadron azimuthal correlations at midrapidity in Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV. They are compared to earlier measurements obtained at sNN=130GeV and in Pb+Pb collisions at sNN=17.2GeV. Sizeable anisotropies are observed with centrality and transverse momentum (pT) dependence characteristic of elliptic flow (v2). For a broad range of centralities, the observed magnitudes and trends of the differential anisotropy, v2(pT), change very little over the collision energy range sNN=62-200GeV, indicating saturation of the excitation function for v2 at these energies. Such a saturation may be indicative of the dominance of a very soft equation of state for sNN∼60-200GeV. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

28844431765	Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for midrapidity production of neutral pions and charged hadrons in polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	Transverse single-spin asymmetries to probe the transverse-spin structure of the proton have been measured for neutral pions and nonidentified charged hadrons from polarized proton-proton collisions at midrapidity and s=200GeV. The data cover a transverse momentum (pT) range 1.0-5.0GeV/c for neutral pions and 0.5-5.0GeV/c for charged hadrons, at a Feynman-x value of approximately zero. The asymmetries seen in this previously unexplored kinematic region are consistent with zero within errors of a few percent. In addition, the inclusive charged hadron cross section at midrapidity from 0.5<pT<7.0GeV/c is presented and compared to next-to-leading order perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations. Successful description of the unpolarized cross section above ∼2GeV/c suggests that pQCD is applicable in the interpretation of the asymmetry results in the relevant kinematic range. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

3042763768	PHENIX detector overview	The PHENIX detector is designed to perform a broad study of A-A, p-A, and p-p collisions to investigate nuclear matter under extreme conditions. A wide variety of probes, sensitive to all timescales, are used to study systematic variations with species and energy as well as to measure the spin structure of the nucleon. Designing for the needs of the heavy-ion and polarized-proton programs has produced a detector with unparalleled capabilities.

The second-harmonic parameter (v2) was measured to describe the observed anisotropy of the azimuthal distribution. The measured inclusive photon v2 is consistent with the value expected for the photons from hadron decay and is also consistent with the lack of direct photon signal over the measured pT range 1-6GeV/c.

The cross sections and nuclear dependence of J/ψ production versus rapidity, transverse momentum, and centrality are obtained and compared to lower energy p+A results and to theoretical models. The observed nuclear dependence in d+Au collisions is found to be modest, suggesting that the absorption in the final state is weak and the shadowing of the gluon distributions is small and consistent with Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-based parametrizations that fit deep-inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan data at lower energies. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The contribution to the inclusive electron spectrum from semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy flavor, i.e., charm quarks or, at high pT, bottom quarks, is determined via three independent methods. The resulting electron spectrum from heavy-flavor decays is compared to recent leading and next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations.

32644488722	Nuclear modification of electron spectra and implications for heavy quark energy loss in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured midrapidity (|η|<0.35) transverse momentum spectra (0.4<pT<5.0GeV/c) of electrons as a function of centrality in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. Contributions from photon conversions and from light hadron decays, mainly Dalitz decays of π0 and η mesons, were removed. The resulting nonphotonic electron spectra are primarily due to the semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy quarks. Nuclear modification factors were determined by comparison to nonphotonic electrons in p+p collisions. A significant suppression of electrons at high pT is observed in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745032617	Azimuthal angle correlations for rapidity separated hadron pairs in d+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Deuteron-gold (d+Au) collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider provide ideal platforms for testing QCD theories in dense nuclear matter at high energy. In particular, models suggesting strong saturation effects for partons carrying small nucleon momentum fraction (x) predict modifications to jet production at forward rapidity (deuteron-going direction) in d+Au collisions. We report on two-particle azimuthal angle correlations between charged hadrons at forward/backward (deuteron/gold going direction) rapidity and charged hadrons at midrapidity in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200GeV. Jet structures observed in the correlations are quantified in terms of the conditional yield and angular width of away-side partners. The kinematic region studied here samples partons in the gold nucleus with x∼0.1 to ∼0.01. Within this range, we find no x dependence of the jet structure in d+Au collisions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646881501	Improved measurement of double helicity asymmetry in inclulsive midrapidity π0 production for polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	We present an improved measurement of the double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in polarized proton-proton scattering at s=200GeV employing the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The improvements to our previous measurement come from two main factors: Inclusion of a new data set from the 2004 RHIC run with higher beam polarizations than the earlier run and a recalibration of the beam polarization measurements for the earlier run, which resulted in reduced uncertainties and increased beam polarizations. The results are compared to a Next to Leading Order (NLO) perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculation with a range of polarized gluon distributions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646471080	Jet structure from dihadron correlations in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Dihadron correlations at high transverse momentum pT in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV at midrapidity are measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. From these correlations, we extract several structural characteristics of jets: the root-mean-squared transverse momentum of fragmenting hadrons with respect to the jet jT2, the mean sine-squared of the azimuthal angle between the jet axes sin2 jj, and the number of particles produced within the dijet that are associated with a high-pT particle (dN/dxE distributions). We observe that the fragmentation characteristics of jets in d+Au collisions are very similar to those in p+p collisions and that there is little dependence on the centrality of the d+Au collision. This is consistent with the nuclear medium having little influence on the fragmentation process. Furthermore, there is no statistically significant increase in the value of sin2 jj from p+p to d+Au collisions. This constrains the effect of multiple scattering that partons undergo in the cold nuclear medium before and after a hard collision. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33646801573	Common suppression pattern of η and π0 mesons at high transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of η mesons have been measured within pT=2-10GeV/c at midrapidity by the PHENIX experiment in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. In central Au+Au the η yields are significantly suppressed compared to peripheral Au+Au, d+Au, and p+p yields scaled by the corresponding number of nucleon-nucleon collisions. The magnitude, centrality, and pT dependence of the suppression is common, within errors, for η and π0. The ratio of η to π0 spectra at high pT amounts to 0.40<Rη/ π0<0.48 for the three systems, in agreement with the world average measured in hadronic and nuclear reactions and, at large scaled momentum, in e+e- collisions. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33747343691	Nuclear effects on hadron production in d+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV revealed by comparison with p+p data	PHENIX has measured the centrality dependence of midrapidity pion, kaon, and proton transverse momentum distributions in d+Au and p+p collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The p+p data provide a reference for nuclear effects in d+Au and previously measured Au+Au collisions. Hadron production is enhanced in d+Au, relative to independent nucleon-nucleon scattering, as was observed in lower energy collisions. The nuclear modification factor for (anti)protons is larger than that for pions. The difference increases with centrality but is not sufficient to account for the abundance of baryon production observed in central Au+Au collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The centrality dependence in d+Au shows that the nuclear modification factor increases gradually with the number of collisions encountered by each participant nucleon. We also present comparisons with lower energy data as well as with parton recombination and other theoretical models of nuclear effects on particle production. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33749465590	Jet properties from dihadron correlations in p+p collisions at s=200GeV	The properties of jets produced in p+p collisions at s=200GeV are measured using the method of two-particle correlations. The trigger particle is a leading particle from a large transverse momentum jet while the associated particle comes from either the same jet or the away-side jet. Analysis of the angular width of the near-side peak in the correlation function determines the jet-fragmentation transverse momentum jT. The extracted value, jT2 =585±6(stat)±15(sys)MeV/c, is constant with respect to the trigger particle transverse momentum, and comparable to the previous lower s measurements. The width of the away-side peak is shown to be a convolution of jT with the fragmentation variable, z, and the partonic transverse momentum, kT. The z is determined through a combined analysis of the measured π0 inclusive and associated spectra using jet-fragmentation functions measured in e+e- collisions. The final extracted values of kT are then determined to also be independent of the trigger particle transverse momentum, over the range measured, with value of kT2 =2.68±0.07(stat)±0.34(sys)GeV/c. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Two independent methods have been used to determine the heavy-flavor yields, and the results are in good agreement with each other. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative QCD calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties, with the data/theory ratio of 1.71±0.02stat±0.18sys for 0.3<pT<9GeV/c.

33847405312	High transverse momentum η meson production in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of η mesons in the range pTf2-12 GeV/c have been measured at midrapidity (|η|<0.35) by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC in p+p,d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The η mesons are reconstructed through their η→γγ channel for the three colliding systems as well as through the η→π0π+π- decay mode in p+p and d+Au collisions. The nuclear modification factor in d+Au collisions, RdAu(pT)1.0-1.1, suggests at most only modest pT broadening ("Cronin enhancement"). In central Au+Au reactions, the η yields are significantly suppressed, with RAuAu(pT)0.2. The ratio of η to π0 yields is approximately constant as a function of pT for the three colliding systems in agreement with the high-pT world average of Rη/π00.5 in hadron-hadron, hadron-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus collisions for a wide range of center-of-mass energies (sNN3-1800 GeV) as well as, for high scaled momentum xp, in e+e- annihilations at s=91.2 GeV. These results are consistent with a scenario where high-pT η production in nuclear collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is largely unaffected by initial-state effects but where light-quark mesons (π0,η) are equally suppressed due to final-state interactions of the parent partons in the dense medium produced in Au+Au reactions. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

For KETmT-m up to ∼1GeV the scaling is compatible with hydrodynamic expansion of a thermalized fluid. For large values of KET mesons and baryons scale separately. Quark number scaling reveals a universal scaling of v2 for both mesons and baryons over the full KET range for Au+Au. For Au+Au and Cu+Cu the scaling is more pronounced in terms of KET, rather than transverse momentum. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The measured yields are compared to those in p+p collisions at the same sNN scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions in d+Au. At all centralities, the yield ratios show no suppression, in contrast to the strong suppression seen for central Au+Au collisions at RHIC. Only a weak pT and centrality dependence can be observed. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The away-side dijet induced azimuthal correlation is broadened, non-Gaussian, and peaked away from Δ =π in central and semicentral collisions in all the systems. The broadening and peak location are found to depend upon the number of participants in the collision, but not on the collision energy or beam nuclei. These results are consistent with sound or shock wave models, but pose challenges to Cherenkov gluon radiation models. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

Measurements in two decay channels (ω→π0π+π- and ω→π 0γ) yield consistent results, and the reconstructed ω mass agrees with the accepted value within the pT range of the measurements. The ω/π0 ratio is found to be 0.85±0.05stat±0.09sys in p+p and 0.94±0.08stat±0.12sys in d+Au collisions, independent of pT.

The extracted αξ parameter, related to the susceptibility of the density fluctuations in the long-wavelength limit, exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of the number of participant nucleons, Npart. A local maximum is seen at Npart~90, with corresponding energy density based on the Bjorken picture of εBjτ~2.4 GeV/(fm2c) with a transverse area size of 60 fm2.

34848881889	Detailed study of high-pT neutral pion suppression and azimuthal anisotropy in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Measurements of neutral pion (π0) production at midrapidity in sNN=200 GeV Au+Au collisions as a function of transverse momentum, pT, collision centrality, and angle with respect to reaction plane are presented. The data represent the final π0 results from the PHENIX experiment for the first RHIC Au+Au run at design center-of-mass energy. They include additional data obtained using the PHENIX Level-2 trigger with more than a factor of 3 increase in statistics over previously published results for pT>6 GeV/c. We evaluate the suppression in the yield of high-pT π0's relative to pointlike scaling expectations using the nuclear modification factor RAA. We present the pT dependence of RAA for nine bins in collision centrality. We separately integrate RAA over larger pT bins to show more precisely the centrality dependence of the high-pT suppression. We then evaluate the dependence of the high-pT suppression on the emission angle Δ of the pions with respect to event reaction plane for seven bins in collision centrality. We show that the yields of high-pT π0's vary strongly with Δ, consistent with prior measurements. We show that this variation persists in the most peripheral bin accessible in this analysis. For the peripheral bins we observe no suppression for neutral pions produced aligned with the reaction plane, whereas the yield of π0's produced perpendicular to the reaction plane is suppressed by a factor of ~2. We analyze the combined centrality and Δ dependence of the π0 suppression in different pT bins using different possible descriptions of parton energy loss dependence on jet path-length averages to determine whether a single geometric picture can explain the observed suppression pattern. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34848889574	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=200GeV: Implications for the polarized gluon distribution in the proton	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider 2005 run with polarized proton collisions at s=200GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are given for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 20GeV/c, extending the range of published data to both lower and higher pT. The cross section is described well for pT<1GeV/c by an exponential in pT, and, for pT>2GeV/c, by perturbative QCD. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented based on a factor of 5 improvement in uncertainties as compared to previously published results, due to both an improved beam polarization of 50%, and to higher integrated luminosity. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton. Using one representative model of gluon polarization it is demonstrated that the gluon spin contribution to the proton spin is significantly constrained. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

36148948687	Measurement of single muons at forward rapidity in p+p collisions at s=200GeV and implications for charm production	Muon production at forward rapidity (1.5≤|η|≤1.8) has been measured by the PHENIX experiment over the transverse momentum range 1≤pT≤3GeV/c in s=200GeV p+p collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. After statistically subtracting contributions from light hadron decays an excess remains which is attributed to the semileptonic decays of hadrons carrying heavy flavor, i.e. charm quarks or, at high pT, bottom quarks. The resulting muon spectrum from heavy flavor decays is compared to PYTHIA and a next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation. PYTHIA is used to determine the charm quark spectrum that would produce the observed muon excess. The corresponding differential cross section for charm quark production at forward rapidity is determined to be dσcc̄/dy|y=1.6=0.243±0.013(stat.) ±0.105(datasyst.)+0.049-0.087(PYTHIAsyst.)mb. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

38049091925	Transverse momentum and centrality dependence of dihadron correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV: Jet quenching and the response of partonic matter	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for charged hadrons from dijets for 0.4<pT<10 GeV/c in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons to p+p data suggest that the away-side can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ∼π and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ∼π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the head region softens toward central collisions, consistent with the onset of jet quenching. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT, which offers constraints on energy transport mechanisms and suggests that it contains the medium response to energetic jets. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Nucleon-gold collisions were selected by tagging events in which a spectator nucleon was observed in one of two forward rapidity detectors. The spectra and yields were investigated as a function of the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, ν, suffered by deuteron nucleons. A comparison of charged particle yields to those in p+p collisions show that yield per nucleon-nucleon collision saturates with ν for high momentum particles.

34247400755	Energy loss and flow of heavy quarks in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV	The PHENIX experiment at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) has measured electrons with 0.3<pT<9GeV/c at midrapidity (|y|<0.35) from heavy-flavor (charm and bottom) decays in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV. The nuclear modification factor RAA relative to p+p collisions shows a strong suppression in central Au+Au collisions, indicating substantial energy loss of heavy quarks in the medium produced at RHIC energies. A large azimuthal anisotropy v2 with respect to the reaction plane is observed for 0.5<pT<5GeV/c indicating substantial heavy-flavor elliptic flow. Both RAA and v2 show a pT dependence different from those of neutral pions. A comparison to transport models which simultaneously describe RAA(pT) and v2(pT) suggests that the viscosity to entropy density ratio is close to the conjectured quantum lower bound, i.e., near a perfect fluid. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

41249103994	Cold nuclear matter effects on J/ψ production as constrained by deuteron-gold measurements at sNN=200 GeV	We present a new analysis of J/ψ production yields in deuteron-gold collisions at sNN=200 GeV using data taken from the PHENIX experiment in 2003 and previously published in S. S. Adler [Phys. Rev. Lett 96, 012304 (2006)]. The high statistics proton-proton J/ψ data taken in 2005 are used to improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter modification factors (RdAu). A suppression of J/ψ in cold nuclear matter is observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction), corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial-state low-x gluons in the gold nucleus. The measured nuclear modification factors are compared to theoretical calculations of nuclear shadowing to which a J/ψ (or precursor) breakup cross section is added. Breakup cross sections of σbreakup=2.8-1. 4+1.7 (2.2-1.5+1.6) mb are obtained by fitting these calculations to the data using two different models of nuclear shadowing. These breakup cross-section values are consistent within large uncertainties with the 4.2±0.5 mb determined at lower collision energies. Projecting this range of cold nuclear matter effects to copper-copper and gold-gold collisions reveals that the current constraints are not sufficient to firmly quantify the additional hot nuclear matter effect. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

84908160199	System-size dependence of open-heavy-flavor production in nucleus-nucleus collisions at sNN =200 GeV	The PHENIX Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has measured open-heavy-flavor production in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV through the measurement of electrons at midrapidity that originate from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom hadrons. In peripheral Cu+Cu collisions an enhanced production of electrons is observed relative to p+p collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions. In the transverse momentum range from 1 to 5 GeV/c the nuclear modification factor is RAA∼1.4. As the system size increases to more central Cu+Cu collisions, the enhancement gradually disappears and turns into a suppression. For pT>3 GeV/c, the suppression reaches RAA∼0.8 in the most central collisions. The pT and centrality dependence of RAA in Cu+Cu collisions agree quantitatively with RAA in d+Au and Au+Au collisions, if compared at a similar number of participating nucleons.

84908191338	Azimuthal anisotropy of D -meson production in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN =2.76 TeV	The production of the prompt charmed mesons D0, D+, and D∗+ relative to the reaction plane was measured in Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon-nucleon collision of sNN=2.76TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. D mesons were reconstructed via their hadronic decays at central rapidity in the transverse-momentum (pT) interval 2-16 GeV/c. The azimuthal anisotropy is quantified in terms of the second coefficient v2 in a Fourier expansion of the D-meson azimuthal distribution and in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA, measured in the direction of the reaction plane and orthogonal to it. The v2 coefficient was measured with three different methods and in three centrality classes in the interval 0%-50%. A positive v2 is observed in midcentral collisions (30%-50% centrality class), with a mean value of 0.204-0.036+0.099 (tot. unc.) in the interval 2<pT<6GeV/c, which decreases towards more central collisions (10%-30% and 0%-10% classes). The positive v2 is also reflected in the nuclear modification factor, which shows a stronger suppression in the direction orthogonal to the reaction plane for midcentral collisions. The measurements are compared to theoretical calculations of charm-quark transport and energy loss in high-density strongly interacting matter at high temperature. The models that include substantial elastic interactions with an expanding medium provide a good description of the observed anisotropy. However, they are challenged to simultaneously describe the strong suppression of high-pT yield of D mesons in central collisions and their azimuthal anisotropy in noncentral collisions.

46349083491	Quantitative constraints on the transport properties of hot partonic matter from semi-inclusive single high transverse momentum pion suppression in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	The PHENIX experiment has measured the suppression of semi-inclusive single high-transverse-momentum π0's in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The present understanding of this suppression is in terms of energy loss of the parent (fragmenting) parton in a dense color-charge medium. We have performed a quantitative comparison between various parton energy-loss models and our experimental data. The statistical point-to-point uncorrelated as well as correlated systematic uncertainties are taken into account in the comparison. We detail this methodology and the resulting constraint on the model parameters, such as the initial color-charge density dNg/dy, the medium transport coefficient q, or the initial energy-loss parameter ε0. We find that high-transverse-momentum π0 suppression in Au+Au collisions has sufficient precision to constrain these model-dependent parameters at the ±20-25% (one standard deviation) level. These constraints include only the experimental uncertainties, and further studies are needed to compute the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

47149098083	Dihadron azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	Azimuthal angle (Δ) correlations are presented for a broad range of transverse momentum (0.4<pT<10 GeV/c) and centrality (0-92%) selections for charged hadrons from dijets in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV. With increasing pT, the away-side Δ distribution evolves from a broad and relatively flat shape to a concave shape, then to a convex shape. Comparisons with p+p data suggest that the away-side distribution can be divided into a partially suppressed "head" region centered at Δ~π, and an enhanced "shoulder" region centered at Δ~π±1.1. The pT spectrum for the associated hadrons in the head region softens toward central collisions. The spectral slope for the shoulder region is independent of centrality and trigger pT. The properties of the near-side distributions are also modified relative to those in p+p collisions, reflected by the broadening of the jet shape in Δ and Δη, and an enhancement of the per-trigger yield. However, these modifications seem to be limited to pT4 GeV/c, above which both the hadron pair shape and per-trigger yield become similar to p+p collisions. These observations suggest that both the away- and near-side distributions contain a jet fragmentation component which dominates for pT5 GeV/c and a medium-induced component which is important for pT4 GeV/c. We also quantify the role of jets at intermediate and low pT through the yield of jet-induced pairs in comparison with binary scaled p+p pair yield. The yield of jet-induced pairs is suppressed at high pair proxy energy (sum of the pT magnitudes of the two hadrons) and is enhanced at low pair proxy energy. The former is consistent with jet quenching; the latter is consistent with the enhancement of soft hadron pairs due to transport of lost energy to lower pT. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The Cu+Cu data offer greatly improved precision over existing Au+Au data for J/ψ production in collisions with small to intermediate numbers of participants, in the range where the quark-gluon plasma transition threshold is predicted to lie. Cold nuclear matter estimates based on ad hoc fits to d+Au data describe the Cu+Cu data up to Npart∼50, corresponding to a Bjorken energy density of at least 1.5GeV/fm3. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

54849413449	Onset of π0 suppression studied in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV	Neutral pion transverse momentum (pT) spectra at midrapidity (|y|□0.35) were measured in Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Relative to π0 yields in p+p collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll) the π0 yields for pT □2GeV/c in central Cu+Cu collisions are suppressed at 62.4 and 200 GeV whereas an enhancement is observed at 22.4 GeV. A comparison with a jet-quenching model suggests that final state parton energy loss dominates in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV, while the enhancement at 22.4 GeV is consistent with nuclear modifications in the initial state alone. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

54049132456	Charged hadron multiplicity fluctuations in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions from sNN=22.5 to 200 GeV	A comprehensive survey of event-by-event fluctuations of charged hadron multiplicity in relativistic heavy ions is presented. The survey covers Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 200 GeV, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=22.5,62.4, and 200 GeV. Fluctuations are measured as a function of collision centrality, transverse momentum range, and charge sign. After correcting for nondynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations in the collision geometry within a centrality bin, the remaining dynamical fluctuations expressed as the variance normalized by the mean tend to decrease with increasing centrality. The dynamical fluctuations are consistent with or below the expectation from a superposition of participant nucleon-nucleon collisions based upon p+p data, indicating that this dataset does not exhibit evidence of critical behavior in terms of the compressibility of the system. A comparison of the data with a model where hadrons are independently emitted from a number of hadron clusters suggests that the mean number of hadrons per cluster is small in heavy ion collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

57149119905	Suppression pattern of neutral pions at high transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at sNN=200GeV and constraints on medium transport coefficients	For Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV, we measure neutral pion production with good statistics for transverse momentum, pT, up to 20GeV/c. A fivefold suppression is found, which is essentially constant for 5<pT<20GeV/c. Experimental uncertainties are small enough to constrain any model-dependent parametrization for the transport coefficient of the medium, e.g., □□ in the parton quenching model. The spectral shape is similar for all collision classes, and the suppression does not saturate in Au+Au collisions. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

60349093226	Inclusive cross section and double helicity asymmetry for π0 production in p+p collisions at s=62.4GeV	The PHENIX experiment presents results from the RHIC 2006 run with polarized p+p collisions at s=62.4GeV, for inclusive π0 production at midrapidity. Unpolarized cross section results are measured for transverse momenta pT=0.5 to 7GeV/c. Next-to-leading order perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations are compared with the data, and while the calculations are consistent with the measurements, next-to-leading logarithmic corrections improve the agreement. Double helicity asymmetries ALL are presented for pT=1 to 4GeV/c and probe the higher range of Bjorken x of the gluon (xg) with better statistical precision than our previous measurements at s=200GeV. These measurements are sensitive to the gluon polarization in the proton for 0.06<xg<0.4. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

68749098511	Gluon-Spin contribution to the proton spin from the double-helicity asymmetry in inclusive π0 production in polarized p+p collisions at s=200GeV	The double helicity asymmetry in neutral pion production for pT=1 to 12GeV/c was measured with the PHENIX experiment to access the gluon-spin contribution, ΔG, to the proton spin. Measured asymmetries are consistent with zero, and at a theory scale of μ2=4GeV2 a next to leading order QCD analysis gives ΔG[0.02,0.3]=0.2, with a constraint of -0.7<ΔG[0. 02,0.3]<0.5 at Δχ2=9 (∼3σ) for the sampled gluon momentum fraction (x) range, 0.02 to 0.3. The results are obtained using predictions for the measured asymmetries generated from four representative fits to polarized deep inelastic scattering data. We also consider the dependence of the ΔG constraint on the choice of the theoretical scale, a dominant uncertainty in these predictions. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

68949120944	Measurement of bottom versus charm as a function of transverse momentum with electron-hadron correlations in p+p Collisions at s=200GeV	The momentum distribution of electrons from semileptonic decays of charm and bottom quarks for midrapidity |y|<0.35 in p+p collisions at s=200GeV is measured by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider over the transverse momentum range 2<pT<7GeV/c. The ratio of the yield of electrons from bottom to that from charm is presented. The ratio is determined using partial D/D̄→e±K X (K unidentified) reconstruction. It is found that the yield of electrons from bottom becomes significant above 4GeV/c in pT. A fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculation agrees with the data within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a general-purpose, heavy-ion detector at the CERN LHC which focuses on QCD, the strong-interaction sector of the Standard Model. It is designed to address the physics of strongly interacting matter and the quark-gluon plasma at extreme values of energy density and temperature in nucleus-nucleus collisions. Besides running with Pb ions, the physics programme includes collisions with lighter ions, lower energy running and dedicated proton-nucleus runs. ALICE will also take data with proton beams at the top LHC energy to collect reference data for the heavy-ion programme and to address several QCD topics for which ALICE is complementary to the other LHC detectors. The ALICE detector has been built by a collaboration including currently over 1000 physicists and engineers from 105 Institutes in 30 countries. Its overall dimensions are 16x16x26 m

70349124227	Photon-hadron jet correlations in p+p and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV	We report the observation at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider of suppression of back-to-back correlations in the direct photon+jet channel in Au+Au relative to p+p collisions. Two-particle correlations of direct photon triggers with associated hadrons are obtained by statistical subtraction of the decay photon-hadron (γ-h) background. The initial momentum of the away-side parton is tightly constrained, because the parton-photon pair exactly balance in momentum at leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics, making such correlations a powerful probe of the in-medium parton energy loss. The away-side nuclear suppression factor, IAA, in central Au+Au collisions, is 0.32±0.12stat±0.09syst for hadrons of 3<pTh<5 in coincidence with photons of 5<pTγ<15 GeV/c. The suppression is comparable to that observed for high-pT single hadrons and dihadrons. The direct photon associated yields in p+p collisions scale approximately with the momentum balance, zT pTh/pTγ, as expected for a measurement of the away-side parton fragmentation function. We compare to Au+Au collisions for which the momentum balance dependence of the nuclear modification should be sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

77649125267	Double-helicity dependence of jet properties from dihadrons in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	It has been postulated that partonic orbital angular momentum can lead to a significant double-helicity dependence in the net transverse momentum of Drell-Yan dileptons produced in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions. Analogous effects are also expected for dijet production. If confirmed by experiment, this hypothesis, which is based on semiclassical arguments, could lead to a new approach for studying the contributions of orbital angular momentum to the proton spin. We report the first measurement of the double-helicity dependence of the dijet transverse momentum in longitudinally polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV from data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2005 and 2006. The analysis deduces the transverse momentum of the dijet from the widths of the near- and far-side peaks in the azimuthal correlation of the dihadrons. When averaged over the transverse momentum of the triggered particle, the difference of the root mean square of the dijet transverse momentum between like- and unlike-helicity collisions is found to be -37±88stat±14systMeV/c. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

75949126346	First proton-proton collisions at the LHC as observed with the ALICE detector: Measurement of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density at √s = 900 GeV	On 23rd November 2009, during the early commissioning of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), two counter-rotating proton bunches were circulated for the first time concurrently in the machine, at the LHC injection energy of 450 GeV per beam. Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot bunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision optics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the ALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the longitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in coincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately reconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events to measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the central region. In the range |η|<0.5, we obtain dN

77953741186	Transition in yield and azimuthal shape modification in dihadron correlations in relativistic heavy ion collisions	Hard-scattered parton probes produced in collisions of large nuclei indicate large partonic energy loss, possibly with collective produced-medium response to the lost energy. We present measurements of π0 trigger particles at transverse momenta pTt=4-12GeV/c and associated charged hadrons (pTa=0.5-7GeV/c) vs relative azimuthal angle Δφ in Au+Au and p+p collisions at √sNN=200GeV. The Au+Au distribution at low pTa, whose shape has been interpreted as a medium effect, is modified for pTt<7GeV/c. At higher pTt, the data are consistent with unmodified or very weakly modified shapes, even for the lowest measured pTa, which quantitatively challenges some medium response models. The associated yield of hadrons opposing the trigger particle in Au+Au relative to p+p (IAA) is suppressed at high pT (IAA ≈ 0.35-0.5), but less than for inclusive suppression (RAA ≈ 0.2). © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77955585485	Transverse momentum dependence of J/ψ polarization at midrapidity in p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	We report the measurement of the transverse momentum dependence of inclusive J/ψ polarization in p+p collisions at √s=200GeV performed by the PHENIX Experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The J/ψ polarization is studied in the helicity, Gottfried-Jackson, and Collins-Soper frames for pT<5GeV/c and |y|<0.35. The polarization in the helicity and Gottfried-Jackson frames is consistent with zero for all transverse momenta, with a slight (1.8 sigma) trend towards longitudinal polarization for transverse momenta above 2GeV/c. No conclusion is allowed due to the limited acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame and the uncertainties of the current data. The results are compared to observations for other collision systems and center of mass energies and to different quarkonia production models. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77955611206	Transverse momentum dependence of η meson suppression in Au+Au collisions at √sNN=200 GeV	New measurements by the PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider for η production at midrapidity as a function of transverse momentum (pT) and collision centrality in √sNN=200 GeV Au+Au and p+p collisions are presented. They indicate nuclear modification factors (RAA) which are similar in both magnitude and trend to those found in earlier π0 measurements. Linear fits to RAA as a function of pT in 5-20 GeV/c show that the slope is consistent with zero within two standard deviations at all centralities, although a slow rise cannot be excluded. Having different statistical and systematic uncertainties, the π0 and η measurements are complementary at high pT; thus, along with the extended pT range of these data they can provide additional constraints for theoretical modeling and the extraction of transport properties. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

77955626838	Midrapidity antiproton-to-proton ratio in pp collisons at √s=0.9 and 7 TeV measured by the ALICE experiment	The ratio of the yields of antiprotons to protons in pp collisions has been measured by the ALICE experiment at √s=0.9 and 7 TeV during the initial running periods of the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement covers the transverse momentum interval 0.45<pt<1.05GeV/c and rapidity |y|<0.5. The ratio is measured to be R|y|<0.5=0.957±0.006(stat)±0. 014(syst) at 0.9 TeV and R|y|<0.5=0.991±0.005(stat)±0.014(syst) at 7 TeV and it is independent of both rapidity and transverse momentum.

The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region (|η|<0.8) over the transverse momentum range 0.15<pT<10 GeV/c. The correlation between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity is also studied. Results are presented for inelastic (INEL) and non-single-diffractive (NSD) events. The average transverse momentum for |η|<0.8 is 〈pT〉INEL=0.483±0.001 (stat.)±0.007 (syst.) GeV/c and 〈pT〉NSD=0.489±0.001 (stat.)±0.007 (syst.) GeV/c, respectively.

78650597800	Suppression of charged particle production at large transverse momentum in central Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV	Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE Collaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral collisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross section. The measured charged particle spectra in |n|<0.8 and 0.3<pT<20 GeV/c are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same sNN, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon collisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor RAA. The result indicates only weak medium effects (RAA≈0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, RAA reaches a minimum of about 0.14 at pT=6-7 GeV/c and increases significantly at larger pT. The measured suppression of high- pT particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies, indicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. © 2010 CERN.

78651268875	Measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries for J/ψ production in polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV	We report the first measurement of transverse single-spin asymmetries in J/ψ production from transversely polarized p+p collisions at √s=200GeV with data taken by the PHENIX experiment in 2006 and 2008. The measurement was performed over the rapidity ranges 1.2<|y|<2.2 and |y|<0.35 for transverse momenta up to 6GeV/c. J/ψ production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider is dominated by processes involving initial-state gluons, and transverse single-spin asymmetries of the J/ψ can provide access to gluon dynamics within the nucleon. Such asymmetries may also shed light on the long-standing question in QCD of the J/ψ production mechanism. Asymmetries were obtained as a function of J/ψ transverse momentum and Feynman-x, with a value of -0.086±0.026stat±0.003syst in the forward region. This result suggests possible nonzero trigluon correlation functions in transversely polarized protons and, if well defined in this reaction, a nonzero gluon Sivers distribution function. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

79960913696	Azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor decay with hadrons in p+p and Au+Au collisions at √s	Measurements of electrons from the decay of open-heavy-flavor mesons have shown that the yields are suppressed in Au+Au collisions compared to expectations from binary-scaled p+p collisions. These measurements indicate that charm and bottom quarks interact with the hot dense matter produced in heavy-ion collisions much more than expected. Here we extend these studies to two-particle correlations where one particle is an electron from the decay of a heavy-flavor meson and the other is a charged hadron from either the decay of the heavy meson or from jet fragmentation. These measurements provide more detailed information about the interactions between heavy quarks and the matter, such as whether the modification of the away-side-jet shape seen in hadron-hadron correlations is present when the trigger particle is from heavy-meson decay and whether the overall level of away-side-jet suppression is consistent. We statistically subtract correlations of electrons arising from background sources from the inclusive electron-hadron correlations and obtain two-particle azimuthal correlations at √s

81555215519	Alignment of the ALICE inner tracking system with cosmic-ray tracks	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiment devoted to investigating the strongly interacting matter created in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC energies.

84855313460	Femtoscopy of pp collisions at √s=0.9 and 7 TeV at the LHC with two-pion Bose-Einstein correlations	We report on the high statistics two-pion correlation functions from pp collisions at √s=0.9TeV and √s=7TeV, measured by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The correlation functions as well as the extracted source radii scale with event multiplicity and pair momentum. When analyzed in the same multiplicity and pair transverse momentum range, the correlation is similar at the two collision energies. A three-dimensional femtoscopic analysis shows an increase of the emission zone with increasing event multiplicity as well as decreasing homogeneity lengths with increasing transverse momentum. The latter trend gets more pronounced as multiplicity increases. This suggests the development of space-momentum correlations, at least for collisions producing a high multiplicity of particles. We consider these trends in the context of previous femtoscopic studies in high-energy hadron and heavy-ion collisions and discuss possible underlying physics mechanisms. Detailed analysis of the correlation reveals an exponential shape in the outward and longitudinal directions, while the sideward remains a Gaussian. This is interpreted as a result of a significant contribution of strongly decaying resonances to the emission region shape. Significant nonfemtoscopic correlations are observed, and are argued to be the consequence of "mini-jet"-like structures extending to low p

84869499352	Production of pions, kaons and protons in pp collisions√s = 900 gev with Alice at the lhc	The production of π<sup>+</sup>, π-, K<sup>+</sup>, K-, p, and p at mid-rapidity has been measured in proton-proton collisions at √ s = 900 GeV with the ALICE detector. Particle identification is performed using the specific energy loss in the inner tracking silicon detector and the time projection chamber. In addition, time-of-flight information is used to identify hadrons at higher momenta. Finally, the distinctive kink topology of the weak decay of charged kaons is used for an alternative measurement of the kaon transverse momentum (pt) spectra. Since these various particle identification tools give the best separation capabilities over different momentum ranges, the results are combined to extract spectra from pt = 100 MeV/c to 2.5 GeV/c. The measured spectra are further compared with QCD-inspired models which yield a poor description. The total yields and the mean pt are compared with previous measurements, and the trends as a function of collision energy are discussed.

84875756746	Charged kaon femtoscopic correlations in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV	Correlations of two charged identical kaons (KchKch) are measured in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV by the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). One-dimensional KchKch correlation functions are constructed in three multiplicity and four transverse momentum ranges. The KchKch femtoscopic source parameters R and λ are extracted. The KchKch correlations show a slight increase of femtoscopic radii with increasing multiplicity and a slight decrease of radii with increasing transverse momentum. These trends are similar to the ones observed for ππ and Ks0Ks0 correlations in pp and heavy-ion collisions. However at high multiplicities, there is an indication that the one-dimensional correlation radii for charged kaons are larger than those for pions in contrast to what was observed in heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. © 2013 CERN.

84885730468	Centrality determination of Pb-Pb collisions at √s	This publication describes the methods used to measure the centrality of inelastic Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair with ALICE. The centrality is a key parameter in the study of the properties of QCD matter at extreme temperature and energy density, because it is directly related to the initial overlap region of the colliding nuclei. Geometrical properties of the collision, such as the number of participating nucleons and the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, are deduced from a Glauber model with a sharp impact parameter selection and shown to be consistent with those extracted from the data. The centrality determination provides a tool to compare ALICE measurements with those of other experiments and with theoretical calculations. © 2013 CERN.

The measurement is performed using the full coverage of the ALICE detectors, -5.0<η<5.5, and employing a special analysis technique based on collisions arising from LHC 'satellite' bunches.

The p<inf>t</inf>-differential production yields in the range 2<p<inf>t</inf><16 GeV/c at central rapidity, |y|<0.5, were used to calculate the nuclear modification factor RAA with respect to a proton-proton reference obtained from the cross section measured at √s = 7 TeV and scaled to √s = 2.76 TeV. For the three meson species, RAA shows a suppression by a factor 3–4, for transverse momenta larger than 5 GeV/c in the 20% most central collisions. The suppression is reduced for peripheral collisions.

In addition, such correlations can be used to search for the presence of a coherent component of pion production. Two- and three-pion correlations of same and mixed charge are measured at low relative momentum to estimate the coherent fraction of charged pions in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with ALICE. The genuine three-pion quantum statistics correlation is found to be suppressed relative to the two-pion correlation based on the assumption of fully chaotic pion emission. The suppression is observed to decrease with triplet momentum. The observed suppression at low triplet momentum may correspond to a coherent fraction in charged-pion emission of 23%±8% © 2014 CERN, for the Alice Collaboration.

84898810279	Heavy-flavor electron-muon correlations in p+p and d+Au collisions at sNN =200 GeV	Background: Heavy-flavor modification in relativistic p(d)+A collisions are sensitive to different kinds of strong-interaction physics ranging from modifications of the nuclear wave function to initial- and final-state energy loss. Modifications to single heavy-flavor particles and their decay leptons at midrapidity and forward rapidity are well established at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Purpose: This paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of electron-muon pairs produced from heavy-flavor decays, primarily cc̄, in sNN=200 GeV p+p and d+Au collision using the PHENIX detector at RHIC. The electrons are measured at midrapidity while the muons in the pair are measured at forward rapidity, defined as the direction of the deuteron beam, in order to utilize the deuteron to probe low-x partons in the gold nucleus. Methods: This analysis uses the central spectrometer arms for electron identification and forward spectrometer arms for muon identification. Azimuthal correlations are built in all sign combinations for e-μ pairs. Subtracting the like-sign yield from the unlike-sign yield removes the correlations from light flavor decays and conversions. Results: Comparing the p+p results with several different Monte Carlo event generators, we find the results are consistent with a total charm cross section σcc̄=538±46 (stat) ± 197 (data syst) ± 174 (model syst) μb. These generators also indicate that the back-to-back peak at Δφ=π is dominantly from the leading-order contributions (gluon fusion), while higher-order processes (flavor excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all Δφ. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in d+Au. We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7<Δφ<3.2 rad is JdA=0.433±0.087 (stat) ± 0.135 (syst). Conclusions: The e-μ pairs result from partons at xAu∼10-2 at Q2=10 GeV/c2 at the edge of the shadowing region. The pair suppression indicates modification to cc̄ pairs for these kinematics in the cold nuclear medium at RHIC. © 2014 American Physical Society.

The transverse momentum spectra at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.5) for charged Ξ and ω hyperons have been studied in the range 0.6 < P<inf>T</inf> < 8.0 GeV/c and 1.2 < P<inf>T</inf> < 7.0 GeV/c, respectively, and in several centrality intervals (from the most central 0-10% to the most peripheral 60-80% collisions). These spectra have been compared with the predictions of recent hydrodynamic models. In particular, the Kraków and EPOS models give a satisfactory description of the data, with the latter covering a wider P<inf>T</inf> range. Mid-rapidity yields, integrated over P<inf>T</inf>, have been determined. The hyperon-to-pion ratios are similar to those at RHIC: they rise smoothly with centrality up to (N<inf>part</inf>) ~ 150 and saturate thereafter. The enhancements (yields per participant nucleon relative to those in pp collisions) increase both with the strangeness content of the baryon and with centrality, but are less pronounced than at lower energies. © 2013 The Authors.

84899766375	Transverse-energy distributions at midrapidity in p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at s NN =62.4 -200 GeV and implications for particle-production models	Measurements of the midrapidity transverse-energy distribution, dET/dη, are presented for p+p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions at sNN=200 GeV and additionally for Au+Au collisions at sNN=62.4 and 130 GeV. The dET/dη distributions are first compared with the number of nucleon participants Npart, number of binary collisions Ncoll, and number of constituent-quark participants Nqp calculated from a Glauber model based on the nuclear geometry. For Au+Au, dET/d/Npart increases with Npart, while dET/d/Nqp is approximately constant for all three energies. This indicates that the two-component ansatz, dET/d (1-x)Npart/2+xNcoll, which was used to represent ET distributions, is simply a proxy for Nqp, and that the Ncoll term does not represent a hard-scattering component in ET distributions. The dET/dη distributions of Au+Au and d+Au are then calculated from the measured p+p ET distribution using two models that both reproduce the Au+Au data. However, while the number-of-constituent-quark- participant model agrees well with the d+Au data, the additive-quark model does not. © 2014 American Physical Society.

Each set of detectors consists of a neutron (ZN) and a proton (ZP) ZDC. They are placed at zero degrees with respect to the LHC axis and allow to detect particles emitted close to beam direction, in particular neutrons and protons emerging from hadronic heavy-ion collisions (spectator nucleons) and those emitted from electromagnetic processes.

84901491096	J/Ψ production and nuclear effects in p-Pb collisions at √sNN=5.02 TeV	Inclusive J/Ψ production has been studied with the ALICE detector in p-Pb collisions at the nucleon-nucleon center of mass energy √sNN = 5.02TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement is performed in the center of mass rapidity domains 2.03 < ycms < 3.53 and ?4.46 < ycms < ?2.96, down to zero transverse momentum, studying the μ+μ? decay mode. In this paper, the J/Ψ production cross section and the nuclear modification factor RpPb for the rapidities under study are presented. While at forward rapidity, corresponding to the proton direction, a suppression of the J/Ψ yield with respect to binary-scaled pp collisions is observed, in the backward region no suppression is present. The ratio of the forward and backward yields is also measured differentially in rapidity and transverse momentum. Theoretical predictions based on nuclear shadowing, as well as on models including, in addition, a contribution from partonic energy loss, are in fair agreement with the experimental results.

84904571237	Technical design report for the upgrade of the ALICE inner tracking system	ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is studying the physics of strongly interacting matter, and in particular the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), using proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN LHC (Large Hadron Collider). The ALICE Collaboration is preparing a major upgrade of the experimental apparatus, planned for installation in the second long LHC shutdown in the years 2018-2019. A key element of the ALICE upgrade is the construction of a new, ultra-light, high-resolution Inner Tracking System (ITS) based on monolithic CMOS pixel detectors. The primary focus of the ITS upgrade is on improving the performance for detection of heavy-flavour hadrons, and of thermal photons and low-mass di-electrons emitted by the QGP. With respect to the current detector, the new Inner Tracking System will significantly enhance the determination of the distance of closest approach to the primary vertex, the tracking efficiency at low transverse momenta, and the read-out rate capabilities. This will be obtained by seven concentric detector layers based on a 50 μm thick CMOS pixel sensor with a pixel pitch of about 30×30 μm

84904965636	Measurement of transverse-single-spin asymmetries for midrapidity and forward-rapidity production of hadrons in polarized p+p collisions at s =200 and 62.4 GeV measurement of transverse-single-spin ... A. ADARE et al.	Measurements of transverse-single-spin asymmetries (AN) in p+p collisions at s=62.4 and 200 GeV with the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider are presented. At midrapidity, AN is measured for neutral pion and eta mesons reconstructed from diphoton decay, and, at forward rapidities, neutral pions are measured using both diphotons and electromagnetic clusters. The neutral-pion measurement of AN at midrapidity is consistent with zero with uncertainties a factor of 20 smaller than previous publications, which will lead to improved constraints on the gluon Sivers function. At higher rapidities, where the valence quark distributions are probed, the data exhibit sizable asymmetries. In comparison with previous measurements in this kinematic region, the new data extend the kinematic coverage in s and pT, and it is found that the asymmetries depend only weakly on s. The origin of the forward AN is presently not understood quantitatively. The extended reach to higher pT probes the transition between transverse momentum dependent effects at low pT and multiparton dynamics at high pT. © 2014 American Physical Society.

84908689756	Freeze-out radii extracted from three-pion cumulants in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC	In high-energy collisions, the spatio-temporal size of the particle production region can be measured using the Bose-Einstein correlations of identical bosons at low relative momentum. The source radii are typically extracted using two-pion correlations, and characterize the system at the last stage of interaction, called kinetic freeze-out. In low-multiplicity collisions, unlike in high-multiplicity collisions, two-pion correlations are substantially altered by background correlations, e.g. mini-jets. Such correlations can be suppressed using three-pion cumulant correlations. We present the first measurements of the size of the system at freeze-out extracted from three-pion cumulant correlations in pp, p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC with ALICE. At similar multiplicity, the invariant radii extracted in p-Pb collisions are found to be 5-15% larger than those in pp, while those in Pb-Pb are 35-55% larger than those in p-Pb. Our measurements disfavor models which incorporate substantially stronger collective expansion in p-Pb as compared to pp collisions at similar multiplicity.

84908370907	Suppression of ϒ{hooked}(1S) at forward rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV	We report on the measurement of the inclusive ϒ{hooked}(1S) production in Pb-Pb collisions at sNN=2.76 TeV carried out at forward rapidity (2.5<y<4) and down to zero transverse momentum using its μ+μ- decay channel with the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. A strong suppression of the inclusive ϒ{hooked}(1S) yield is observed with respect to pp collisions scaled by the number of independent nucleon-nucleon collisions. The nuclear modification factor, for events in the 0-90% centrality range, amounts to 0.30±0.05(stat)±0.04(syst). The observed ϒ{hooked}(1S) suppression tends to increase with the centrality of the collision and seems more pronounced than in corresponding mid-rapidity measurements. Our results are compared with model calculations, which are found to underestimate the measured suppression and fail to reproduce its rapidity dependence.

84911032256	Multiparticle azimuthal correlations in p -Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider	Measurements of multiparticle azimuthal correlations (cumulants) for charged particles in p-Pb at sNN=5.02 TeV and Pb-Pb at sNN=2.76 TeV collisions are presented. They help address the question of whether there is evidence for global, flowlike, azimuthal correlations in the p-Pb system. Comparisons are made to measurements from the larger Pb-Pb system, where such evidence is established. In particular, the second harmonic two-particle cumulants are found to decrease with multiplicity, characteristic of a dominance of few-particle correlations in p-Pb collisions. However, when a |Δη| gap is placed to suppress such correlations, the two-particle cumulants begin to rise at high multiplicity, indicating the presence of global azimuthal correlations. The Pb-Pb values are higher than the p-Pb values at similar multiplicities. In both systems, the second harmonic four-particle cumulants exhibit a transition from positive to negative values when the multiplicity increases. The negative values allow for a measurement of v2{4} to be made, which is found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions at similar multiplicities. The second harmonic six-particle cumulants are also found to be higher in Pb-Pb collisions. In Pb-Pb collisions, we generally find v2{4}≃v2{6}≠0 which is indicative of a Bessel-Gaussian function for the v2 distribution. For very high-multiplicity Pb-Pb collisions, we observe that the four- and six-particle cumulants become consistent with 0. Finally, third harmonic two-particle cumulants in p-Pb and Pb-Pb are measured. These are found to be similar for overlapping multiplicities, when a |Δη|>1.4 gap is placed.

The PHENIX experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider has performed a systematic study of KS0 and K∗0 meson production at midrapidity in p+p,d+Au, and Cu+Cu collisions at sNN=200 GeV. The KS0 and K∗0 mesons are reconstructed via their KS0→π0(→γγ)π0(→γγ) and K∗0→K±π decay modes, respectively. The measured transverse-momentum spectra are used to determine the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons in d+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at different centralities. In the d+Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor of KS0 and K∗0 mesons is almost constant as a function of transverse momentum and is consistent with unity, showing that cold-nuclear-matter effects do not play a significant role in the measured kinematic range. In Cu+Cu collisions, within the uncertainties no nuclear modification is registered in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, both mesons show suppression relative to the expectations from the p+p yield scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions in the Cu+Cu system. In the pT range 2-5 GeV/c, the strange mesons (KS0,K∗0) similarly to the φ meson with hidden strangeness, show an intermediate suppression between the more suppressed light quark mesons (π0) and the nonsuppressed baryons (p,p¯). At higher transverse momentum, pT>5 GeV/c, production of all particles is similarly suppressed by a factor of ≈2.

The nuclear modification factor RpPb, quantifying the D-meson yield in p-Pb collisions relative to the yield in pp collisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, is compatible within the 15%-20% uncertainties with unity in the transverse momentum interval 1<pT<24GeV/c. No significant difference among the RpPb of the four D-meson species is observed. The results are described within uncertainties by theoretical calculations that include initial-state effects. The measurement adds experimental evidence that the modification of the momentum spectrum of D mesons observed in Pb-Pb collisions with respect to pp collisions is due to strong final-state effects induced by hot partonic matter.

Events are selected with a dimuon pair produced either in the rapidity interval, in the laboratory frame, 2.5<y<4 (p-Pb) or -3.6<y<-2.6 (Pb-p), and no other particles observed in the ALICE acceptance. The measured cross sections σ(γ+p→J/ψ+p) are 33.2±2.2(stat)±3.2(syst)±0.7(theor)nb in p-Pb and 284±36(stat)-32+27(syst)±26(theor)nb in Pb-p collisions. We measure this process up to about 700 GeV in the γp center of mass, which is a factor of two larger than the highest energy studied at HERA. The data are consistent with a power law dependence of the J/ψ photoproduction cross section in γp energies from about 20 to 700 GeV, or equivalently, from Bjorken x scaling variable between ∼2×10-2 and ∼2×10-5, thus indicating no significant change in the gluon density behavior of the proton between HERA and LHC energies.

Abstract: The ALICE Collaboration has studied the inclusive production of the charmonium state ψ(2S) in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at the nucleon-nucleon centre of mass energy (formula presented.) = 5.02 TeV at the CERN LHC. The measurement was performed at forward (2.03 < y<inf>cms</inf>< 3.53) and backward (−4.46 < y<inf>cms</inf>< −2.96) centre of mass rapidities, studying the decays into muon pairs. In this paper, we present the inclusive production cross sections σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>, both integrated and as a function of the transverse momentum p<inf>T</inf>, for the two y<inf>cms</inf> domains. The results are compared to those obtained for the 1S vector state (J/ψ), by showing the ratios between the production cross sections, as well as the double ratios [σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>/σ<inf>J/ψ</inf> ]<inf>pPb</inf>/[σ<inf>ψ(2S)</inf>/σ<inf>J/ψ</inf>]<inf>pp</inf> between p-Pb and proton-proton collisions. Finally, the nuclear modification factor for inclusive ψ(2S) is evaluated and compared to the measurement of the same quantity for J/ψ and to theoretical models including parton shadowing and coherent energy loss mechanisms. The results show a significantly larger suppression of the ψ(2S) compared to that measured for J/ψ and to models. These observations represent a clear indication for sizeable final state effects on ψ(2S) production.[Figure not available: see fulltext.

Van der Meer scans were performed for both configurations of colliding beams, and the cross section was measured for two reference processes, based on particle detection by the T0 and V0 detectors, with pseudo-rapidity coverage 4.6 < η < 4.9, -3.3 < η < -3.0 and 2.8 < η < 5.1, -3.7 < η < -1.7, respectively. Given the asymmetric detector acceptance, the cross section was measured separately for the two configurations. The measured visible cross sections are used to calculate the integrated luminosity of the proton-lead and lead-proton data samples, and to indirectly measure the cross section for a third, configuration-independent, reference process, based on neutron detection by the Zero Degree Calorimeters.
