15744370693	Temperature and pressure responsive characteristics of polymer packaged fiber Bragg grating with large dynamic range	The pressure and temperature response characteristics of polymer packaged fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor are analyzed. The experimental results show that the pressure sensitivity is not a constant but a variable because of the effect of temperature on elastic modulus of polymer when the change range of temperature is large. The pressure sensitivity is 0.036 nm/MPa at 30°C and 0.175 nm/MPa at 180°C and the change of sensitivity is piecewise linear at different temperature range. So elastic modulus should be treated as the function of temperature when using polymer to packaged FBG, the pressure coefficient in the coefficient matrix of FBG should also be the function of temperature in order to eliminate the error induced by the change of elastic modulus caused by large range temperature change.

FBG1 and FBG2 are stuck to the hollow and solid sections of cylinder along the axis direction by strong pastern. The changes of temperature and pressure result in the wavelength shift of FBG1. Only the change of temperature in the cylinder causes the wavelength shift of FBG2, the pressure's influence can be neglected. The external pressure and temperature can be simultaneously and discriminatingly measured by testing the reflective wavelength shift of FBG1 and FBG2.

The dual-peak response of a single FBG that stuck to a cantilever that has asymmetric structure is observed. The results show that a single fibre Bragg grating produce two reflecting peaks because of the different strain distribution in the asymmetric cantilever. In experiment, when load changes from 0 to 200 g, the distance between two peaks increase 0.16 nm. And the changes of distance between two peaks are linear to the changes of load while temperature doesn't affect the distance between two peaks. So it can solve the problem of cross-sensitivity of temperature and stress and eliminate the error induced by the shift of temperature when this kind of structure is used to coat the FBG.
