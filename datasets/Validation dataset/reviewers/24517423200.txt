84928895073	Application of a novel integrated pointing device apparatus for people with severe disability	Background: To improve the computer operation for people with severe disabilities, more flexible pointing devices are required. This study investigates the effectiveness of a new developed Integrated Pointing Device Apparatus (IPDA), that can integrate numerous commercial pointing devices, for people with severe disabilities. Methods: We collected 20 children with quadriplegic cerebral palsy (CP) and 25 people with high cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI). People with disabilities were classified into 2 groups based on pointing device used: group A1 (SCI) or A2 (CP), who used standard mice, and group B1 (SCI) or B2 (CP), who were unable to use standard mice (IPDA combinations). All subjects received clinical severity and three specific mouseoperating efficiency assessments (continuous clicking, targetacquisition, drag-and-drop tasks). The efficiency of the people with disabilities in each mouse-operation task was expressed as a percentage of that for able-bodied subjects (%NL). The level of statistical significant was set at a value of P less than .05. Results: Group B1 or B2 displayed similar operational efficiency in performing the drag-and-drop tasks to group A1 or A2, although they exhibited worse efficiency than group A1 or A2 in performing the continuous-clicking tasks (P<.05). The use of pointing devices was associated with American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale of people with SCI, and Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) of children with CP (P<.05). Conclusion: The IPDA could help most people with severe disabilities who could not utilize commercial mice to achieve acceptable operational efficiencies. Pointing devices were assigned based on the underlying severity.

9144266460	Effects of visual feedback rhythmic weight-shift training on hemiplegic stroke patients	Objective: To assess the balance function of hemiplegic stroke patients and to investigate whether visual feedback rhythmic weight-shift training following acute stroke can decrease falls among patients with hemiplegic stroke. Design: A prospective study, using a Balance Master. Setting: Hospital-based rehabilitation units. Subjects: Fifty-two hemiplegic stroke patients (28 in the training group and 24 in the control group). Interventions: Conventional stroke rehabilitation programme plus visual feedback rhythmic weight-shift training. Training effect was evaluated by assessing the static and dynamic balance performance as well as comparing the occurrence of falls in the training and control groups at six-month follow-up. Main measures: Occurrence of falls; static balance in different sensory conditions; and dynamic balance performance, including on-axis velocity and directional control during rhythmic weight-shift. Results: Significant improvement in dynamic balance performance was found in hemiplegic patients in the training group. The improvement was sustained for six months. With regarding to static balance function, no significant improvement was found. At six-month follow-up, 5 of 28 patients (17.8%) in the training group had fallen, compared with 10 of 24 patients (41.7%) in the control group. The occurrence of falls decreased, although not statistically significantly (p =0.059). Conclusions: Visual feedback rhythmic weight-shift training may improve dynamic balance function for hemiplegic stroke patients. The effects of training may be sustained for six months. The occurrence of falls decreased in the training group, but not statistically significantly. © Arnold 2004.

1642320855	Clinical Effects of Botulinum Toxin A and Phenol Block on Gait in Children with Cerebral Palsy	Objective: To compare the treatment effectiveness of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and phenol blocks in managing lower limb spasticity and gait dysfunction in children with cerebral palsy. Design: This is a case-controlled study that took place in a tertiary center's gait laboratory. A total of 27 ambulatory children with cerebral palsy spastic diplegia, aged from 3 to 7 yrs, and 20 normal children were recruited into this study. Sixteen children with cerebral palsy received BTX-A injections, and 11 received phenol motor point blocks. Gait analyses were assessed by a portable computer-assisted system (Computer DynoGraphy, Infotronic, The Netherlands). Both the BTX-A and phenol groups received gait analysis at 1 wk before and 2 mos after injection treatments. Results: Significant improvements in gait variables of velocity and cadence were noted in children with cerebral palsy after BTX-A injections as compared with the phenol block group. Gaitline and cyclogram patterns also improved significantly in the BTX-A group. The adverse clinical effects of BTX-A injections were less severe as compared with phenol injections. Conclusions: BTX-A injections demonstrated superior treatment effects in improving gait variables and patterns in children with spastic diplegia as compared with phenol blocks. BTX-A injections also revealed fewer clinical side effects and were well tolerated by children with cerebral palsies.

20344388322	Comparison between botulinum toxin type A injection and selective posterior rhizotomy in improving gait performance in children with cerebral palsy	Object. Both botulinum toxin type A (BTA) injection and selective posterior rhizotomy (SPR) are well-recognized treatments for children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP); however, there has been no study in which the long-term effectiveness of these two approaches has been compared. Methods. The study population comprised 62 ambulatory children with spastic diplegic CP who were participating in the same rehabilitation program and 19 healthy volunteers. The children with CP were divided into the following three groups: BTA (22 cases), SPR (20 cases), and no treatment (20 cases); the healthy volunteers served as the control group. A computer-assisted gait analysis system was used to assess gait performance. Gait was assessed in the three groups of children at 1 week before treatment, and 3, 6, 12, and 20 months after treatment. Based on the analysis of walking velocity, cadence, and step length, the BTA group demonstrated rapid improvement posttreatment but the improvement became insignificant after 12 months even with repeated BTA injections at 4-month intervals. In contrast, the SPR group displayed initial deterioration of gait parameters during the first 3 months posttreatment and then improved continuously from 6 to 20 months. The control group did not display a significant change in gait. Conclusions. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of BTA injection is more short-lived and SPR initially decreases gait performance but is expected to improve gait performance at between 6 and 20 months after the procedure.

0031293735	Development of a biofeedback training system for cognitive rehabilitation in cerebral palsy	A new biofeedback computer-aided biofeedback training system for cognitive rehabilitation in cerebral palsy was developed. It was very difficult for cerebral palsied children to handle entirely in the cognitive rehabilitation protocol. So, in this study, biofeedback training including light, sound, color images and other special functions can induce cerebral palsied children interested in the rehabilitation protocol. Specially, cognitive training is very much important to cerebral palsy which may make the decision of their futures. The purposes of this study are: (1) to develop a computer-based and low cost biofeedback (visual, audio) training system for cognitive rehabilitation. (2) to improve the reaction time and cognitive abilities of cerebral palsied children. At first, the system was tested by twenty normal children to make sure the system basic functions and could work normally. Then, it will apply to cerebral palsied children for future clinical investigation.

24944590762	Effects of task constraints on reaching kinematics by healthy adults	Understanding the control of movement requires an awareness of how tasks constrain movements. The present study investigated the effects of two types of task constraints - spatial accuracy (effector size) and target location - on reaching kinematics. 15 right-handed healthy young adults (7 men, 8 women) whose mean age was 23.6 yr. (SD = 3.9 yr.) performed the ringing task under six conditions, formed by the crossing of effector size (larger vs smaller size) and target location (left, right, or a central position). Significant main effects of effector size and target location were found for peak velocity and movement time. There was a significant interaction for the percentage of time to peak velocity. The findings suggested that task constraints may modulate movement performance in specific ways. Effects of effector size might be a consequence of feedforward and feedback control, and location effects might be influenced by both biomechanical and neurological factors. © Perceptual and Motor Skills 2005.

26944499782	Features of developmental functions and autistic profiles in children with Fragile X syndrome	Background: In this study, we investigated the developmental functions and autistic profiles in children with Fragile X syndrome (FXS). In addition, we established the relationships between developmental and autistic profiles in these children. Methods: The medical records of 12 children with FXS, aged 2 to 7 years, were collected. Fifteen children with autism, without FXS, who were age- and sex-matched were selected as the comparison group. All children underwent assessments of developmental functions according to the Chinese Child Development Inventory (CCDI), and autistic profiles according to the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). Differences in genders between the two groups were determined with the Fisher's exact test. Differences in developmental functions (CCDI) and autistic profiles (CARS) between the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U test and Bonferroni adjustment. The Spearman's rho correlation was used to determine the relationship of developmental functions and autistic profiles. Results: All developmental functions in children with FXS were better than those with autism except for gross motor, fine motor and expressive language functions. Children with FXS had the worst expressive language function (56% Development Quotient, DQ) as compared with other developmental functions (> 70% DQ). The major difference between the children with FXS and those with autism was personal social function with a difference of 33% DQ. The average total CARS score were lower in children with FXS (average score, 28) than children with autism (average score, 34). Spearman's correlation demonstrated the CARS total score were negatively correlated with all developmental functions, except for gross motor function. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the FXS children had multifaceted and disproportional development patterns in motor, speech and social domains when compared with the autism children without FXS. The developmental functions were inversely correlated with autistic profiles. Therefore, when applying comprehensive assessment, we were able to identify the special developmental features in children with FXS.

33646129454	Critical Score of Glasgow Coma Scale for Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury	The aim of this study is to determine the predictive critical value of the Glasgow Coma Scale for use as a determinant of outcome for children with traumatic brain injuries. A total of 309 children, aged 2-10 years, were enrolled in this study. Each subject underwent the following assessments: Glasgow Coma Scale; clinical data; brain computed tomography; and Glasgow Outcome Scale assessments. The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a critical point of the Glasgow Coma Scale set at 5 was most strongly correlated with outcome of pediatric traumatic brain injury. Subarachnoid hemorrhage with brain swelling and edema, subdural, intracerebral hemorrhage, and basal ganglion lesions were associated with severe injury and poor outcome (P < 0.05). However, cortical lesions did not affect injury severity and outcome. In injuries associated with traumatic brain injuries, only chest trauma had a tendency to be associated with poor outcome (P < 0.05). Of the factors analyzed, the score of the Glasgow Coma Scale was the most effective predictor for outcome in pediatric traumatic brain injury. Furthermore, the predictive critical score of the Glasgow Coma Scale should be set at 5 for pediatric traumatic brain injury. The computed tomographic findings also were important in determining injury severity and predicting outcome. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

33646800197	Enhancement of Operational Efficiencies for People With High Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries Using a Flexible Integrated Pointing Device Apparatus	Chen C-L, Chen H-C, Cheng P-T, Chen C-Y, Chen H-C, Chou S-W. Enhancement of operational efficiencies for people with high cervical spinal cord injuries using a flexible integrated pointing device apparatus. Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of a universal integrated pointing device apparatus (IPDA), which can integrate numerous commercial pointing devices and can be controlled by various combinations of available movements, for people with cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) who cannot operate standard computer pointing devices. Design: An exploratory quasi-experimental design. All subjects were required to perform specific mouse-operating (continuous-clicking, target-acquisition, drag-and-drop) tasks. People with SCI received clinical assessments and were classified into 2 groups based on pointing device used: group A, who used standard mouse devices, and group B (IPDA combinations), who were unable to use standard mouse devices. The measures of group A and group B were compared. Setting: Rehabilitation science center of a medical institution. Participants: Thirty-seven people with high cervical SCI and 30 able-bodied subjects. Intervention: The IPDA. Main Outcome Measures: The efficiency of the people with SCI in each mouse-operation task was expressed as a percentage of that for able-bodied subjects (%NL). Results: Group B displayed similar operational efficiency in performing the drag-and-drop tasks (≈30% NL) to group A, although they exhibited worse efficiency than group A in performing the other tasks (P<.05).

33749482991	Application of a novel integrated pointing device apparatus for children with cerebral palsy	Background: To improve the computer operation of children suffering from cerebral palsy (CP) with severe disabilities, more flexible pointing devices are required. This study investigates the effectiveness of a newly developed Integrated Pointing Device Apparatus (IPDA) that can integrate numerous commercial pointing devices. Methods: We enrolled 27 children with quadriplegic CP and 15 healthy children. All children were required to perform three specific mouse operation tasks. Children with CP were classified into two groups based on hand operation: one hand (group A) and both hands (group B). The efficiency of children with CP in each mouse operation task was expressed as a percentage of that for normal children (% NL). Results: Group A operated a standard mouse with their dominant hand; group B had to use both hands to operate a mouse via IPDA. Group A demonstrated better efficiency of continuous-clicking tasks than group B (p < 0.05). Group B had a similar level of efficiency in the target-acquisition task (30% NL) and drag-and-drop task (20% NL) as that of group A, although group B could not operate a standard mouse with one hand. All children in group A were spastic quadriplegia, while 30% of children in group B were spastic-athetoid (p < 0.05). All children in group B were at level 3 of the gross motor functional classification system (GMFCS) but only 57% of children in group A were at level 3 (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The IPDA can help some children with CP, who cannot utilize a commercial mouse alone, to achieve acceptable operational efficiency. The operation methods for children with CP were determined by their underlying motor control.

33751175166	Design and feasibility study of an integrated pointing device apparatus for individuals with spinal cord injury	Despite the commercial availability of numerous computer-pointing devices, many severely disabled individuals still rely on customized equipment to operate computers. This study presents a novel Integrated Pointing Device Apparatus (IPDA) that integrates numerous commercial pointing devices. The novel IPDA, which complies with a standard USB 1.1 interface, is compatible with most tested computer-pointing devices and flexibly integrates commercial computer devices, tailoring them to suit individual needs. By using simple integrated circuit design and low-cost electronic components, this low-cost apparatus is easily maintained. The feasibility of the IPDA was evaluated by four subjects with high-level cervical (C4-5) spinal cord injury (SCI). Participants performed normal move-and-click and drag-and-drop tasks typically performed by computer pointing devices. Each participant not able to use a traditional computer mouse or trackball were able to operate a computer adequately with the IPDA and three including one operating a trackball with his chin, operated computers easily and smoothly. This feasibility study showed that the IPDA effectively integrates commercial pointing devices, thereby providing the possibility for some people with SCI to obtain computer operability. This study demonstrated the advantages of flexibility, low cost, and acceptable efficiency of the novel IPDA. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33847242988	A Randomized Controlled Trial of Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy for Elderly Stroke Survivors: Changes in Motor Impairment, Daily Functioning, and Quality of Life	Wu C-Y, Chen C-L, Tsai W-C, Lin K-C, Chou S-H. A randomized controlled trial of modified constraint-induced movement therapy for elderly stroke survivors: changes in motor impairment, daily functioning, and quality of life. Objective: To examine the benefits of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) on motor function, daily function, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in elderly stroke survivors. Design: Two-group randomized controlled trial, with pretreatment and posttreatment measures. Setting: Rehabilitation clinics. Participants: Twenty-six elderly stroke patients (mean age, 72y) with 0.5 to 31 months postonset of a first-ever cerebrovascular accident. Interventions: Twenty-six patients received either mCIMT (restraint of the unaffected limb combined with intensive training of the affected limb) or traditional rehabilitation for a period of 3 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), FIM instrument, Motor Activity Log (MAL), and Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The FMA evaluated the severity of motor impairment; the FIM instrument and MAL reported daily function; and the SIS detected HRQOL. Results: The mCIMT group exhibited significantly greater improvements in motor function, daily function, and the physical domain of HRQOL than the traditional rehabilitation group. Patients in the mCIMT group perceived significantly greater percent of recovery after treatment than patients in the traditional rehabilitation group. Conclusions: These findings suggest mCIMT is a promising intervention for improving motor function, daily function, and physical aspects of HRQOL in elderly patients with stroke. The mCIMT was well tolerated by the elderly patients even though it is a rigorous training program. © 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

34247099689	Ground reaction force patterns in stroke patients with various degrees of motor recovery determined by plantar dynamic analysis	Background: To study ground reaction force (GRF) patterns in stroke patients with various degrees of motor recovery, using plantar dynamic analysis. Methods: Forty-three people with hemiplegic stroke and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. Motor impairment (motor recovery and muscle tone) and plantar dynamic data (GRF patterns, peak pressure, and walking speeds) were analyzed. GRF patterns were categorized into four patterns based on the force magnitude (spatial features) through time (temporal features) of the vertical GRF. Then stroke patients were classified into good (patterns III and IV) and poor groups (patterns I and II). Results: Patients with hemiplegic stroke showed characteristic GRF patterns which could be categorized from bimodal (pattern IV) to pathological shapes (I-III). The peak pressures on the paretic side in the metatarsal and toe areas were reduced in stroke patients compared with those in healthy subjects. Walking speeds were higher in the good group than in the poor group (p < 0.05). The peak pressures on both sides in the metatarsal and midfoot areas were lower in the poor group than in the good group (p < 0.05). GRF patterns were highly correlated with walking speeds (r = 0.92, p < 0.01). GRF patterns and walking speeds were positively correlated with motor recovery of knee movement (r > 0.4, p < 0.01), but not with hip and ankle movement or muscle tone in the lower limb. Conclusions: GRF patterns, correlated with walking speeds, indicate underlying motor control of hemiplegic or hemiparetic gait. Knee motor control may be the most important factor in determining walking performance. Plantar dynamic analysis could allow clinicians an alternative assessment in detecting gait changes and planning therapeutic strategies in stroke patients.

34547488387	Kinematic and Clinical Analyses of Upper-Extremity Movements After Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy in Patients With Stroke: A Randomized Controlled Trial	Wu CY, Chen CL, Tang SF, Lin KC, Huang YY. Kinematic and clinical analyses of upper-extremity movements after constraint-induced movement therapy in patients with stroke: a randomized controlled trial. Objective: To study the effects of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) relative to traditional intervention on motor-control strategies for upper-arm reaching and motor performance at the impairment and functional levels in stroke patients. Design: Two-group randomized controlled trial (RCT); pretreatment and posttreatment measures. Setting: Rehabilitation clinics. Participants: Forty-seven stroke patients (mean age, 55y) 3 weeks to 37 months postonset of a first-ever cerebrovascular accident. Interventions: Forty-seven patients received either CIMT (restraint of the less affected hand combined with intensive training of the more affected upper extremity) or traditional intervention (control treatment) during the study. The treatment intensity was matched between the 2 groups (2h/d, 5d/wk for 3wk). Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes were evaluated using (1) kinematic variables of reaching movement used to describe the control strategies for reaching, (2) the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of motor-impairment severity, and (3) the Motor Activity Log (MAL) evaluating the functional ability of the upper extremity. Results: After treatment, the CIMT group showed better strategies of reaching control than the control group (P<.03). The CIMT group also showed less motor impairment on the FMA (P=.019) and higher functional ability on the MAL (P<.001). Conclusions: This study is the first RCT to show differences in motor-control strategies as measured by kinematic variables after CIMT versus traditional intervention. In addition to improving motor performance at the impairment and functional levels, CIMT conferred therapeutic benefits on control strategies determined by kinematic analysis. © 2007 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

34748885571	Effects of object use on reaching and postural balance: A comparison of patients with unilateral stroke and healthy controls	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the functional use of certain task objects while standing influences reaching performance and postural balance in persons with left or right cerebral vascular accidents, and also in healthy individuals. DESIGN: Thirty-five stroke patients (20 patients with left and 15 patients with right cerebral vascular accidents) and 31 healthy controls (15 using the left and 16 the right arm) performed two experimental reaching tasks (task object present vs. absent) using the less affected arm while standing. For the object-present task, subjects held a glass and moved it forward as far as possible. For the object-absent task, subjects simply reached forward as far as possible. We measured reaching performance using kinematic analysis and assessed postural control using derivatives of the center of pressure, including forward displacement, mediolateral shift, and average velocity. RESULTS: Object presence did not significantly improve overall reaching performance in any group. However, for patients with left cerebral vascular accidents and controls (using either the left or the right arm), there were significant effects of object presence on the average velocity of the center of pressure. For patients with right cerebral vascular accidents, there were significant effects of task object on the forward distance and average velocity of the center of pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The positive findings regarding center-of-pressure derivatives suggest that a functional use of objects during a standing reaching task can decrease postural sway, as represented by the average velocity of the center of pressure, in individuals with and without stroke. Patients with right cerebral vascular accidents may benefit considerably more from functional object use during a standing reaching task, apparently because such tasks can facilitate greater forward displacement of the center of pressure. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

0034234922	Correlation of polyelectromyographic patterns and clinical upper motor neuron syndrome in hemiplegic stroke patients	Objective: To investigate the correlation between movement patterns, measured by polyelectromyography (PEMG), and clinical upper motor neuron (UMN) syndrome in stroke patients. Design: PEMG patterns, recorded from pairs of flexor-extensor muscles during voluntary maneuvers, and motor outcomes were assessed approximately 1 month after stroke (early stage). Motor outcomes were reassessed 6 months later (late stage). Participants: Thirty- nine hemiplegic stroke patients and 18 healthy control subjects. Main Outcome Measures: Passive stretch reflexes (PSRs), Brunnstrom's stages, and walking ability. Results: Six PEMG patterns, varying from complete reciprocal to complete synchrony, were identified. Higher PEMG pattern scores were associated with better Brunnstrom's stages (r > .80), walking ability (r > .39), and some PSRs (r < -.37). PEMG patterns could separate patterns 1 and 2 from patterns 3 and 4 for patients with early Brunnstrom's stages 1 and 2. Patterns 1 and 2 (reduced agonist electromyographic activities) indicated weakness and resulted in the worst motor outcomes. Patterns 3 and 4 (cocontraction and coactivation) indicated spasticity and associated synergistic movements. Patients with patterns of 5 and 6 (reciprocal electromyographic activities) had more selective motor control. Conclusions: PEMG patterns correlate with clinical UMN syndromes and may allow treatment strategy planning on the basis of underlying motor control, as well as the prediction of final motor outcomes soon after stroke, even in patients who cannot move their legs initially.

31744451198	Effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation on cough capacity and pulmonary function in patients with acute cervical cord injury	Objective: To assess the effectiveness of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on cough capacity and prevention of pulmonary complication in patients with acute cervical cord injury. Design: A randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Twenty-six tetraplegic patients with cervical spinal cord injury, 13 in the NMES therapy group and 13 in the control group. Methods: NMES was applied to the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major and abdominal muscle. Pulmonary function tests were performed before and after therapy, and at 3 months and 6 months follow-up. The pulmonary complications in this 6-month follow-up period were also recorded. Results: After the 4-week therapy, and at 3 months and 6 months follow-up testing, patients in the NMES therapy group displayed significant improvement in their peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity, maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, compared with those in the control group (p<0.05). Patients in the NMES therapy group also had fewer pulmonary complications in the follow-up period. Conclusion: NMES over the pectoralis and abdominal muscles might improve cough capacity and pulmonary function in cervical spinal cord injury with tetraplegia. This improvement might last for 6 months. With this improvement, pulmonary complications were reduced. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

45249121529	Relationship between unstimulated salivary flow rate and saliva composition of healthy children in Taiwan	Background: Saliva is one of the most important factors in regulating oral health, with flow rate and composition changing throughout development and during disease. In view of the shortage of data, the present study aimed to shed light on the relationship between unstimulated salivary flow rate and saliva composition of healthy children in Taiwan. Methods: Forty-four normal, healthy children from 3-14 years of age were divided into three age groups: pre-school, elementary school and junior-high school. All participants received salivary flow rate, pH and saliva composition analysis under unstimulated conditions. One-way ANOVA and Pearson's correlation were used. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: Our results suggest that, under unstimulated conditions, the salivary flow rate of the elementary school group was greater than that of the pre-school group (p < 0.05). No difference in pH was found among the three groups. Intergroup salivary calcium, phosphorus and amylase did not reach statistical difference. As the flow rate increased, the pH increased (r = 0.364, p < 0.05) but the protein level decreased (r = -0.473, p < 0.05). In addition, salivary protein was positively correlated to age (r = 0.479, p < 0.05) and negatively correlated to pH (r = -0.361, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Age-related increase in the unstimulated salivary flow rate of pre-school and elementary school groups was noted. As the flow rate increased, the pH increased but the protein level decreased. The information obtained may serve as reference values for the growing interest in saliva as a diagnostic tool, especially monitoring those with neurological or oral motor dysfunction.

45549083357	The beneficial effects of a functional task target on reaching and postural balance in patients with right cerebral vascular accidents	This study evaluated the effect of context on the reaching performance of the unaffected arm and postural control while standing in patients with right cerebral vascular accidents (RCVA) and in healthy adults. Fifteen subjects with RCVA and sixteen healthy subjects performed tasks with the right hand under two conditions while standing. One condition involved moving coins forward on a table as far as possible (concrete task) and the other reaching forward without a target (abstract task). Forward reaching distance, forward displacement and lateral shift of center of pressure (CoP), and weight distribution were the dependent variables. The RCVA and control groups achieved significantly greater reaching distances in the concrete task than in the abstract one. The RCVA group showed significantly less lateral shift of the CoP and placed more weight on the affected leg in the concrete than the abstract task, whereas the control group made a greater lateral shift in the concrete task and had a similar mean ratio of weight distribution during both tasks. The results demonstrate that a functional application of task targets may favorably modulate both reaching and posture performance and exert various positive affects on postural control. Such applications may have a place in the therapeutic recovery efforts for patients afflicted with stroke. © 2008 Human Kinetics, Inc.

54349099306	Acoustic study in Mandarin-speaking children: Developmental changes in vowel production	Background: Acoustic analysis had been well incorporated into clinical evaluation and management of children with speech disorders for many years. The aim of this study is to investigate developmental changes in vowel production in Mandarin-speaking children using acoustic study analysis. Methods: A total of 22 children from 5-12 years old were analyzed in this study. Each child read a list of speech materials consisting of 6 dissyllabic words in Mandarin phonemes and the speech samples were recorded. The digitized acoustic recordings were submitted for acoustic analysis. The acoustic parameters in this study include the first and second formant frequencies (F1 and F2) of /a/, /i/ and /u/ and the vowel space. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test and Spearman's rho correlation test for statistical analysis. Results: The F1 values of the vowel /i/ were significantly lower in boys than those in girls (p = 0.013) by Wilcoxon ranksum test. The F1 value of the vowel /i/ was negatively correlated with children's age (rho = -0.601, p = 0.003) and their body height (rho = 0.478 p = 0.045). The F1 values of the other two vowels (/u/ and /a/), the F2 values of all three vowels and the vowel space had no association with age and gender. Conclusions: F1 acoustic parameters have developmental and gender changes in vowel production in Mandarin-speaking children. The data in this study provide references for acoustic assessment of Mandarin-speaking children.

56849097629	Effect of Magnetic Knee Wrap on Quadriceps Strength in Patients With Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis	Chen C-Y, Chen C-L, Hsu SC-C, Chou S-W, Wang K-C. Effect of magnetic knee wrap on quadriceps strength in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Objective: To determine the effects of magnetic knee wrap on isokinetic quadriceps strength in patients with painful knee osteoarthritis (OA). Design: Randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and before-after trial. Setting: Rehabilitation clinic in a tertiary hospital. Participants: Eligible patients (N=50) (mean age ± SD, 66.0±8.6y) with mild to moderate knee OA were recruited from the outpatient department and 37 (74%) completed the trial. Only 3 (6%) withdrew due to study-related adverse effects. Interventions: Wearing the active (n=24) or sham (n=26) magnetic knee wrap for 12 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was isokinetic quadriceps strength. Secondary outcome measures included the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Pain Scale. Results: Using intention-to-treat analyses, the peak isokinetic quadriceps strength increased significantly in the treated leg at 30°/s (P=.007) and 60°/s (P=.022) after wearing the magnetic knee wrap. Compared with baseline, the median strength increase for the treated leg in the study group significantly exceeded that in the control group at week 4 (.05Nm/kg vs -.09Nm/kg at 60°/s, P=.038) and week 12 (30°/s, .09Nm/kg vs .04Nm/kg, P=.044; 60°/s, .17Nm/kg vs .02Nm/kg, P=.031). The HAQ-DI and HAQ Pain Scales improved significantly in both groups. Compared with baseline, the improvement at week 12 in terms of the HAQ-DI in the study group significantly exceeded that in the control group. Conclusions: Magnetic knee wrap may significantly facilitate isokinetic quadriceps strength in patients with mild to moderate knee OA. © 2008 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

65249149558	Responsiveness and validity of three outcome measures of motor function after stroke rehabilitation	Background and Purpose - This study investigated and compared the responsiveness and validity of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) for patients after stroke rehabilitation. Methods - A total of 57 patients with stroke received 1 of 3 rehabilitation treatments for 3 weeks. At pretreatment and posttreatment, the 3 outcome measures, as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FDVI) as the external criterion, were administered. The standardized response mean (SRM) and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to examine the responsiveness. Construct validity and predictive validity were examined by the Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ). Results - The responsiveness of the FMA, ARAT, and WMFT functional ability scores was large (SRM=0.95-1.42), whereas the WMFT performance time score was small (SRM=0.38). The responsiveness of the FMA was significantly larger than those of the ARAT and the WMFT-TIME, but not the WMFT functional ability scores. With respect to construct validity, correlations between the FMA and other measures were relatively high (ρ=0.42-0.76). The FMA and the WMFT performance time scores at pretreatment had moderate predictive validity with the FDVI scores at posttreatment (ρ=0.42-0.47). In addition, the ARAT and the WMFT functional ability scores revealed a low predictive validity with the FDVI (θ=0.17-0.26). Conclusions - The results support the FMA and the WMFT-FAS are suitable to detect changes over time for patients after stroke rehabilitation. While simultaneously considering the responsiveness and validity attributes, the FMA may be a relatively sound measure of motor function for stroke patients based on our results. Further research based on a larger sample is needed to replicate the findings. © 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.

66949178725	Relationships between gross motor functions and health-related quality of life of Taiwanese children with cerebral palsy	OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships between gross motor functions and physical and psychosocial components of the health-related quality of life of children with cerebral palsy. DESIGN: Participants comprising 90 children (53 boys, 37 girls; mean age ± SD = 8.2 ± 2.4 yrs) with cerebral palsy were enrolled by a cross-sectional design. Gross motor function measure was used to quantify their gross motor functions. Their health-related quality of life was determined by the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (traditional Chinese version), completed by their caregivers. RESULTS: A significant moderate positive correlation (r = 0.73, P < 0.01) existed between the physical summary scores of the Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 and gross motor function measure, 66 scores in Taiwanese children with cerebral palsy. There was no significant correlation between the psychosocial summary scores of Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 and gross motor function measure, 66 scores in cerebral palsy (r = -0.13, P = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Gross motor functions may be good predictors of the physical component of health-related quality of life, but they are poor predictors of the psychosocial component of health-related quality of life in children with cerebral palsy. In the future, more comprehensive information regarding children's comorbidities may need to be objectively gathered to provide professionals a better understanding of their health-related quality of life. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

67650818549	Pointing device usage guidelines for people with quadriplegia: A simulation and validation study utilizing an integrated pointing device apparatus	This study undertakes a simulation and validation experiment to provide guidelines regarding pointing device usage for quadriplegic individuals assisted by a newly developed integrated pointing device apparatus (IPDA). The simulation experiment involving 30 normal subjects whose upper limb movement was restricted by splints. Another 15 subjects with high level cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) were recruited for the validation study. All normal subjects employed six control modes for target-acquisition and drag-and-drop tasks using an IPDA to integrate common pointing devices. A previously designed software was used to evaluate the operational efficiency (OE), expressed as able performance (%AP), of the subjects. The experimental results indicated that the OE of normal subjects for controlling the pointing devices were dominated first by using the unilateral hand (69100 %AP), then by using the wrist/hand (6573 %AP), and finally by using either bilateral body parts or the combination of limb and chin (4553 %AP). The OE for operating an orientation-rotated mouse using the dominant wrist/hand via IPDA in both tasks was equivalent to that for operating a trackball using the dominant hand. The experimental results obtained by subjects with SCI also demonstrated similar findings, although the OEs in each control mode were lower than in normal subjects. Results of this study provide valuable guidelines for selecting and integrating common pointing devices using IPDA for quadriplegic individuals. The priority for selecting which body part should control the pointing devices was as follows: unilateral hands, unilateral wrist/hands, and either bilateral body parts or a limb and chin/head/neck in combination. © 2006 IEEE.

67650269687	Effects of Knight-Taylor brace on balance performance in osteoporotic patients with vertebral compression fracture	Objective: To assess the changes in static and dynamic balance and movement strategies in patients with severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture while wearing and not wearing the Knight-Taylor (K-T) spinal brace. Subjects: 47 patients with severe osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, which was confirmed on radiographs and with bone density measurements obtained by dual energy X-ray absorption. Intervention: Patients were randomly subjected to computerized dynamic posturography, which contained sensory organization tests, motor control balance test at 75% limit of stability (LOS) in 8 movement directions, and left/right rhythmic weight shift test (L/R RWS), while wearing and not wearing the K-T spinal brace, respectively. Results: Patients wearing the spinal brace had significantly increased average stability, significantly increased average maximal stability under the swayed vision with fixed support surface condition and under the eye open with swayed support surface condition, significantly increased ankle strategy and decreased average velocity of COG target sway under the eye open with swayed support surface condition, significantly reduced the frequency of falls under the eye closed with swayed support surface condition and swayed vision with swayed support surface condition, and significantly decreased in the percentage of directional control with no difference of reaction time in the LOS test, and an increase in the on-axis velocity in the L/R RWS test. Conclusions: The K-T spinal brace efficiently enables the subjects to maintain static and dynamic motor balance. Its use decreases the fall frequency but limits the directional control in severe osteoporotic patients with vertebral compression fracture. © 2009 IOS Press. All rights reserved.

67651165579	Comparison of the static and dynamic balance performance in young, middle-aged, and elderly healthy people	Background: Body sway increases with age. The purpose of this study was to obtain baseline data and the characteristics of balance performance in different age groups for balance strategy management. Methods: Healthy individuals (n = 107) were divided into young, middle-aged, and elderly groups, and assessed by computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) on a Smart Balance Master. The 6 subtests in the sensory organization tests (SOT) for the CDP were as follows: subtest 1, eyes open, fixed support platform; subtest 2, eyes closed, fixed platform; subtest 3, eyes open, fixed platform; subtest 4, eyes open, swaying platform; subtest 5, eyes closed, swaying platform; subtest 6, swaying visual surround, swaying platform. Motor balance control tests included the limit of stability (LOS) test at 75% of LOS in 8 directions and the left/right and forward/backward rhythmic weight shift (RWS) test. Results: In the SOT, the elderly group demonstrated significantly lower average stability and maximal stability scores in subtests 4-6. This group also demonstrated a relatively lower average percentage of ankle strategy in subtests 4-6. In the motor control tests, the elderly group demonstrated a significantly higher overall reactive time and lower overall directional control in the LOS test, lower on-axis velocity during the forward/backward and left/right motor control test and a lower average percentage of forward/backward directional control in the RWS test. Conclusion: The elderly had a higher degree of postural imbalance and used hip strategy to a greater extent to maintain their balance, especially when standing on a swaying support surface in the absence of visual surround or with conflicted visual surround. The elderly required a longer reaction time and demonstrated lower directional control in balance performance.

70350714431	Errors in force generation and changes in controlling patterns following agonist muscle fatigue	The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether agonist muscle fatigue changed the coactivation time and the co-contraction magnitude of the agonist and antagonist muscle, and if the agonist muscle fatigue produced bias (constant error: CE) and inconsistency (variable error: VE) of the force. Subjects are 10 healthy people and one person with impaired proprioception. EMG and force for fast (0.19 ± 0.06 s) and slow (1.20 ± 0.44 s) targeted isometric dorsiflexions were recorded before and after fatigue of the dorsiflexors. The results revealed that the coactivation time increased after fatigue only in the slow contractions but the co-contraction magnitude did not change. The postfatigue increment of the CE was greater in the fast contractions than in the slow ones. We conclude that the postfatigue compensatory strategy can reduce the fatigueinduced bias. The change of muscles activation level after fatigue might be under the influence of the common drive. Impaired proprioception is a possible cause of the fatigue-related increase in bias and inconsistency. © 2009 Human Kinetics, Inc.

0035166063	Temporal stride and force analysis of cane-assisted gait in people with hemiplegic stroke	Objective: To understand the underlying biomechanics of temporal stride and force in people with hemiplegic stroke during cane-assisted walking. Design: Three forceplates, 6 cameras, and an instrumented cane were integrated to analyze the cane-assisted gait of people with hemiplegic stroke. Temporal-stride parameters, and peak vertical, anterior (propulsive), posterior (braking), and lateral shear forces, as well as propulsive-breaking impulses were analyzed. Setting: Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Medical Center, Taiwan. Participants: Twenty people with hemiplegic stroke. Main Outcome Measures: Temporal-stride and force parameters. Results: All patients walked at a relatively slow speed, ranging from 4.2 to 35.8cm/s. The triple and double support occupied most of the gait cycle (GC), whereas the single support occupied only 10% of GC. The applied vertical, propulsive, braking, and lateral shear forces on either foot and the cane were 89.7% to 97.6%, 2.2% to 4.8%, 2.9% to 3.9%, and 5.5% to 6.7% body weight (BW), respectively. Patients applied less than 25% BW of peak vertical forces on the cane. They applied greater peak propulsive forces and impulses on the sound foot, while applying greater peak braking forces and impulses on the affected foot and cane. Conclusions: The cane provided support and a braking function for people with hemiplegic stroke. People with stroke walking with cane assistance rely mostly on the sound limb for propulsion, while using the affected limb and cane for braking. Data provided could be useful in assessing the nature of cane assistance and in planning therapeutic strategies for people with stroke. © 2001 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.

74949144416	Follow-up of developmental profiles in children with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy	Background: The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in the developmental profiles of children with spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (CP). Additionally, the relationship of developmental functions between the initial and final stages was determined. Methods: This prospective study enrolled forty-six children with SQ CP between 2-6 years old and assessed their developmental profiles using the Chinese Child Developmental Inventory on the initial and final assessments. The interval between two assessments was 1.0 ± 0.3 years. Eight developmental domains, including gross motor, fine motor, expressive language, concept comprehension, situation comprehension, self help, personal social and general development, were evaluated and qualified by the development quotient (DQ). The DQ change index (%) was calculated to evaluate the differences in each domain between the two assessments. The paired t test was used to compare differences in each domain between the two assessments. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship of each domain between the final and initial assessments. Results: Children with SQ CP had lower DQs than normal children in all developmental functions on both assessments (23 - 66%). The DQ distributions were lowest in the gross motor and self help domains, higher in the fine motor, situation comprehension, and personal social domains, and highest in the expressive language, concept comprehension, and general development domains. Except for the fine motor and concept comprehension domains, the DQs of the developmental functions were significantly decreased on the final assessment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings suggest preschool children with SQ CP had impairments in the full spectrum of developmental profiles. The course of developmental profiles evolves with age. Most developmental functions did not increase proportionally with increasing age in children with SQ CP.

77649097656	Dynamic postural control during trunk bending and reaching in healthy adults and stroke patients	ObjectiveS: Postural stability is often task-demand-dependent and often impaired in stroke patients. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the difference in the center of pressure measures during forward bending of the trunk and reaching on postural actions between normal subjects and stroke patients and (2) to examine the effects of task demands on the center of pressure measures in both groups. Design: Thirteen normal subjects and 23 stroke patients performed two trials of forward bending of the trunk and reaching for each of the targets at six locations at floor level while standing on a 0.5-m-long pressure mat. Center of pressure excursion, center of pressure average velocity, and bilateral limb weight-bearing ratios characterized the postural actions. Mixed-Design analysis of variance was used. Results: A significant target location by group interaction effects was found for all variables except the center of pressure average velocity. All variables except center of pressure average velocity showed significant group differences. The center of pressure excursion and bilateral limb weight-bearing ratio were smaller, and the center of pressure average velocity was larger in stroke patients than in normal subjects. The effects of target location on variables measured were prominent in stroke patients. The posturography of stroke patients was less regular than that of normal subjects. Stroke patients tended to avoid shifting their center of pressure toward the affected side, even when highly necessary. Conclusions: The difference of postural actions between groups depended on task demands. Small center of pressure displacement and fast center of pressure velocity characterized decreased adaptive postural actions. The amount of center of pressure shift and center of pressure velocity were also dependent on the task demands for both groups. Copyright © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77649166432	Constraint-induced therapy versus control intervention in patients with stroke: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study	Objective: This study compared the effects of a distributed form of constraint-induced therapy with control intervention in motor recovery and brain reorganization after stroke. Design: A two-group randomized controlled trial with pretreatment and posttreatment measures was conducted. Thirteen patients with stroke were randomly assigned to the distributed form of constraint-induced therapy (n = 5) or the control intervention group (n = 8). Outcome measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Motor Activity Log, and functional magnetic resonance imaging examination. The number of activation voxels and laterality index were determined from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data for the study of brain reorganization. Results: The distributed form of constraint-induced therapy group exhibited significantly greater improvements in the Fugl-Meyer Assessment and Motor Activity Log than the control intervention group. The functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed that distributed form of constraint-induced therapy significantly increased activation in the contralesional hemisphere during movement of the affected and unaffected hand. The control intervention group showed a decrease in primary sensorimotor cortex activation of the ipsilesional hemisphere during movement of the affected hand. Conclusions: The preliminary findings indicate that brain adaptation may be modulated by specific rehabilitation practices, although generalization of the functional magnetic resonance imaging findings is limited by sample size. Further research is needed to identify the specific neural correlates of the behavioral gains achieved after rehabilitation therapies. Copyright © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77951762293	Comparison between hospital-based and community-based services for the special health care needs of children with developmental delays	Background: Recognizing special health care needs (SHCN) is obligatory for children with developmental delay (DD). The purpose of this study was to compare hospital-based and community-based services for the SHCN of children with DD. Methods: We collected 114 children with DD. An expert-designed questionnaire was used to measure the SHCN of children in either hospital-based or community-based services. The questionnaire included the children's characteristics, family ecology and SHCN, which encompassed four categories, team assessment and counseling, rehabilitation, complementary and alternative treatment, and home care. We compared the differences and needs between the two health care services. Results: More children with DD in hospital-based services had disabled certificates, catastrophic illness certificates and multiple caregivers than communitybased services. More children with DD in community-based services had severe-disabled certificates than those in hospital-based services (p < 0.001). Children in hospital-based services had more SHCN for some items of team assessment and counseling, rehabilitation, and complementary and alternative treatment than those in community-based services (p < 0.05). The need for home care was not significantly different between the two services except for nutrition counseling (p = 0.048). Conclusion: SHCN in multiple aspects imply the necessity for team assessment and counseling, rehabilitation, complementary and alternative treatments and nutrition counseling in approaching children with DD in hospital-based services.

77952546037	Psychometric comparisons of the Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale	Purpose This study compared the responsiveness and criterion-related validity of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) for patients after stroke rehabilitation. Methods The SIS and SS-QOL, along with five criterion measures-the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Motor Activity Log, the Functional Independence Measure, the Frenchay Activities Index, and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale-were administered to 74 patients with stroke before and after a 3-week intervention. Responsiveness was examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and standardized response mean (SRM). Criterion-related validity was investigated using the Spearman correlation coefficient (q). Results Whereas the SS-QOL subscales were nonresponsive to changes, the SIS hand function showed medium responsiveness (SRM = .52, Wilcoxon Z = 4.24, P>.05). Responsiveness of the SIS total also was significantly larger than that of the SS-QOL total (SRM difference, .36; 95% confidence interval, .02-.71). Criterion validity of the SIS hand function was good (q = .51-.68; P>.01), but that of the SS-QOL was only fair (q = .25-.31; P>.05). Conclusion Because the SIS had better overall responsiveness and the SIS hand function showed medium responsiveness and good criterion validity, the SIS appears to be more suited for assessing changes after stroke rehabilitation.

77955601619	Developmental profiles of preschool children with spastic diplegic and quadriplegic cerebral palsy	Cerebral palsy (CP) is a disorder of movement and posture control with multiple impairments. The clinical manifestations of CP vary among children. The aim of this study was to compare the developmental profiles of preschool children with either of two types of CP: spastic diplegic (SD) CP and spastic quadriplegic (SQ) CP. Relationships between the children's various developmental functions were also investigated. We recruited 137 children with spastic CP, aged 1-5 years (mean age = 3.7 ± 2.1 years), and we classified them into two groups: SD (n = 59) and SQ (n = 78). The comparison group comprised 18 children with typical development. Developmental functions were assessed in all the children, using the Chinese Child Development Inventory with the updated norms. This scale addressed eight functional domains: gross motor ability, fine motor ability, expressive language ability, concept comprehension ability, situation comprehension ability, self-help ability, personal-social skills, and general development. A development quotient (DQ) was determined for each domain as a percentage of the developmental age divided by the chronological age. The developmental profiles of the CP subtypes were found to differ. Children with SQ were found to have lower DQs than those with SD (p < 0.01). There was also a difference in the distribution of DQs between the SD and SQ groups, although the lowest DQ in both groups was for the gross motor domain. An uneven delay in the development of gross motor function was found in both groups of children with CP. Motor functions, including gross motor and fine motor functions, were significantly related to self-help ability. Complex and significant correlations among developmental functions were also identified in children with CP. The findings in the present study may allow clinicians to anticipate the developmental profile of children with CP on the basis of whether they have the SD or SQ subtype. This, in turn, is likely to facilitate individual assessment, goal setting, and the planning of interventions in children with CP. © 2010 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

77957361049	Factors associated with motor speech control in children with spastic cerebral palsy	Background: Speech production is often impaired in children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study investigated the factors associated with motor speech control in children with spastic cerebral palsy. Methods: Thirty-three children with spastic CP who were able to speak were identified for this study. They were classified into two groups: group A (spastic diplegia or hemiplegia, n = 17) and group B (spastic quadriplegia, n = 16). Each child received various assessments, namely cognition, language, modified Verbal Motor Production Assessment for Children (VMPAC), speech intelligibility, CP subtype, and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Results: Group A showed better cognition and language function, higher modified VMPAC scores and better GMFCS levels than group B (p < 0.05). However, the two groups did not significantly differ in speech intelligibility. Linear regression indicated that all modified VMPAC scores were negatively related to CP subtype (adjusted r

77957368482	Developmental profiles and mentality in preschool children with prader-willi syndrome: A preliminary study	Background: A majority of the children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have global developmental delay and mental delay. The aim of this study was to investigate the developmental profiles and mental assessments among preschool children with PWS. Methods: Ten children with PWS between the ages of 15 months to 6 years, and 11 children with typical development were enrolled. Developmental profiles in terms of their developmental quotient (DQ) for the eight domains of the Chinese Children Developmental Inventory (CCDI) and mental assessments in terms of intelligence quotient (IQ) and developmental index (DI) were carried out for all children. Results: The DQs of all eight domains, including gross motor, fine motor, expressive language, concept comprehension, situation comprehension, self help, personal-social and general development, in the PWS group were lower than the DQs of the children from the typical development group (p > 0.01). Children with PWS had better DQs in the fine motor domain than in the gross motor domain and in the receptive language domain than in the expressive language domain. Furthermore, their verbal IQ were better than their performance IQ and their mental DI was better than their psychomotor DI. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the children with PWS show an uneven global developmental delay together with an uneven mental delay. The results of this study should allow clinicians to better understand the developmental functioning of children with PWS and this will help with the planning of treatment strategies.

77957370731	Comparison of developmental pattern change in preschool children with spastic diplegic and quadriplegic cerebral palsy	Background: This study compares the longitudinal change of developmental patterns in preschool children with spastic diplegic (SD) and spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (CP). Methods: Sixty children with spastic CP, aged 1-5 years (3.2± 1.2 years), were classified into 2 groups: SD (n = 29) and SQ (n = 31). Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels were classified during the initial assessments. Developmental profiles, including development quotients (DQs) of gross motor, fine motor, expressive language, concept comprehension, situation comprehension, self help, personal social and general development, were evaluated on initial and final assessments and an average of one year later. The DQ change index (%) was calculated as 100% x (final DQ - initial DQ)/initial DQ. Results: Children with SQ had lower DQs in all developmental functions than those with SD on both assessments (p < 0.01). The DQ distributions of developmental profiles were different in SD and SQ groups, although both groups displayed the lowest DQs in the gross motor domain. As indicated by the DQ change index, most DQs increased with age in children with SD; however, most decreased with age in children with SQ (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings suggest different CP subtypes demonstrate various development profiles. The evolvement of developmental patterns with age was different in children with various CP subtypes.

77958495534	Oromotor variability in children with mild spastic cerebral palsy: A kinematic study of speech motor control	Background. Treating motor speech dysfunction in children with CP requires an understanding of the mechanism underlying speech motor control. However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis. Methods. We collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups. Results. CP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups. Conclusion. High STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment. © 2010 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78249247060	Relationships between developmental profiles and ambulatory ability in a follow-up study of preschool children with spastic quadriplegic cerebral palsy	Background: To investigate the follow-up course of developmental profiles in preschool children with spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (CP) who had varying ambulatory abilities. Methods: Forty-eight children with SQ CP between 1 and 5 years old were classified into 2 groups, the ambulatory and non-ambulatory groups, based on Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels during the initial assessment. The developmental profiles, consisting of development quotients (DQs) of 8 domains, were evaluated during the initial assessment and the final assessment one year later. The DQ change index (%) was calculated as 100% × (final DQ - initial DQ)/initial DQ. Results: The DQs of all developmental domains in the non-ambulatory group were lower than those in the ambulatory group on both initial and final assessments (p < 0.01). As indicated by the DQ change indices, most DQs in the ambulatory group decreased slightly, whereas those in the non-ambulatory group decreased considerably (p < 0.05). Furthermore, fine motor function increased proportionally with age in the ambulatory group, but not in the non-ambulatory group. Conclusion: The DQs of the developmental profiles varied in preschool CP children with different ambulatory abilities. The course of developmental profiles in preschool children with SQ CP evolves with age and relates to the degree of ambulatory function. Knowledge of these developmental profiles may be helpful in understanding, predicting, and managing the developmental problems of these children.

78651259039	Brain reorganization after bilateral arm training and distributed constraint-induced therapy in stroke patients: A preliminary functional magnetic resonance imaging study	Background: Bilateral arm training (BAT) and constraint-induced therapy (CIT) have shown beneficial effects in improving motor control and function of the upper extremities (UE) for patients with stroke. Thus far, no study has directly investigated the relative effects of BAT versus CIT on brain reorganization. This study compared the effects of BAT with distributed CIT (dCIT) on brain reorganization and motor function in 6 stroke patients. Methods: In a pre-post randomized controlled trial, 6 stroke patients received BAT (intensive bilateral simultaneous and symmetrical training) or dCIT (restraint of the unaffected UE combined with intensive training of the affected UE) for a period of 3 weeks, 5 days per week. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examination and 3 clinical measures (Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Action Research Arm Test, and Motor Activity Log) were administered before and after the intervention. Results: After intervention, patients showed varied patterns of fMRI changes and improved motor function. Two well-recovered patients, one from each group, showed large increases in bilateral hemisphere activation, especially in the ipsilesional hemisphere during affected hand movement and in the contralesional hemisphere during unaffected hand movement. During bilateral elbow movement, 3 of the 4 BAT patients showed increased bilateral cerebellum activation, especially in the left cerebellum, whereas 2 dCIT patients showed decreased cerebellar activation. Conclusions: The findings of this preliminary research revealed that neuroplastic changes after stroke motor rehabilitation may be specific to the intervention. Further research using a larger sample and more complex fMRI tasks is warranted to validate the findings.

79953795681	Nocturia is an independent predictor of severe obstructive sleep apnea in patients with ischemic stroke	Severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of stroke recurrence and mortality after stroke. Since nocturia is common in post-stroke patients with OSA, this study explored the predictive role of nocturia for severe OSA in patients with ischemic stroke. This was a cross-sectional, prospective study involving 65 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke admitted to rehabilitation ward. All participants received polysomnography and clinical assessments, including a 3-day urinary frequency - volume recording. Differences in study variables between patients with and without severe OSA were compared, and logistic regression analyses with backward selection procedures were used to assess the relationship between OSA severity and nocturia. Patients with severe OSA were older (69.6 ± 9.9 vs. 62.6 ± 11.5 year), had a significantly higher desaturation index (37.9 ± 16.1 vs. 8.8 ± 6.1 episodes/night) and had a higher frequency of nocturia (2.2 ± 1.0 vs. 1.5 ± 0.8 episodes/night) than those without. In addition, men with severe OSA had a larger neck circumference (409 ± 26 vs. 381 ± 32 mm) than those without. The frequency of nocturia, age, sex, and interaction between sex and neck circumference remained significant in the final regression model for severe OSA. In this model, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.96; P<0.001) with sensitivity and specificity of 80.6 and 82.8%, respectively. The odds ratio of nocturia was highest (3.5) among the four variables. Nocturia is an independent predictor for severe OSA, and the final prediction model might be used when screening for severe OSA in patients with ischemic stroke. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Setting: Rehabilitation clinic of a tertiary hospital. Subjects: Fifty volunteers with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis participated and 33 (66%) completed the trial; only one (2%) withdrew due to study-related adverse effects. Interventions: Knee wraps with a static magnetic field (35 mT) were compared with control knee wraps for 12 weeks. Main measures: The main outcome measure was JPS at first, fourth, and twelfth week while applying of the knee wrap, quantified as the ability to replicate target knee joint angles. The secondary outcome was the Comprehensive Osteoarthritis Test (COAT) total score. Results: In the intention-to-treat analysis with an alpha-level of 0.05, 12-week application of the MKWs did not significantly reduce the mean absolute error (MAE) of JPS (n=18; P=0.627); contrarily, the MAE was found to decrease significantly after wearing the sham MKWs (n=20; P=0.01). The COAT total score gradually improved in both groups (P<0.05). When comparing the improvement of MAE and COAT total score at each follow-up between two groups, no significant differences were found; the maximal difference in the improvement of MAE between two groups was noted at week 12 (mean difference: 1.2°; 95% confidence interval -0.4 to 2.9; P=0.144). In the per-protocol analysis, the study group showed better improvement in the COAT total score at week 12 (P=0.033). Conclusion: The 35-mT MKWs could not significantly influence knee JPS in individuals with mild-to-moderate knee osteoarthritis. © The Author(s), 2011.

79954614263	The relationship between parental concerns and final diagnosis in children with developmental delay	Parental concern is a useful screening approach for early detection of children with developmental delay. We investigated the relationships among parental concerns, functional impairment, and final diagnosis of children (n = 273) with developmental delays. Of these, motor, language, and global delay were most common. Parental concerns, especially in language and motor development, were good predictors of children with language or motor delay, and provided reliable information for detection of children with delays in these domains. Parents were less likely to identify children with cognitive problems, global delay, or associated behavioral problems. Co-occurrence of developmental disorders was also recognized, especially in children with global delay. We conclude that parental concerns are useful information for detection of specific developmental problems in children. Because co-occurrence of developmental disorders is common, their early recognition would be helpful for better care of these children. © 2011 The Author(s).

79958274962	Effects of home-based constraint-induced therapy versus dose-matched control intervention on functional outcomes and caregiver well-being in children with cerebral palsy	This study compared home-based constraint-induced therapy (CIT) with a dose-matched home-based control intervention for children with cerebral palsy (CP). The differences in unilateral and bilateral motor performance, daily functions, and quality of parental well-being (i.e., the stress level of their parents) were evaluated. The study included 21 children with CP (age range, 48-119 months) who were randomly assigned to the CIT or control group. All participants received individualized home-based interventions, 3.5-4. h a day, twice a week for 4. weeks. Primary outcomes were measured by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales II (PDMS-2) and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) is the whole name of the assessment. All first letters of this instrument title should be in upper case. Secondary outcome measures were the Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL), the Caregiver Functional Use Survey (CFUS), and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI). Outcome measures were performed at baseline (pretreatment), 4. weeks (posttreatment), and 6-month (follow-up). Compared with the control group, the CIT group exhibited significantly better performance in grasping control as measured by the PDMS-2, unilateral/bilateral motor efficacy as measured by the BOTMP, and unilateral hand function as measured by the PMAL immediately after the treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, CIT had beneficial effects on grasping control assessed by PDMS-2 and on unilateral/bilateral functional performance measured by the PMAL and CFUS. Parents in both groups reported comparable stress levels at the 6-month follow-up, although the parent-child dysfunctional interaction deteriorated more immediately after CIT than after the control intervention. The follow-up of this randomized controlled trial suggested beneficial effects of home-based CIT on unilateral grasping skills and unilateral/bilateral functional performance at 6 months. The higher stress level reported by the parents in the CIT group than in the control group at posttreatment is temporary and could be alleviated at a longer period of time. Home-based CIT is a feasible and effective alternative to the intervention administered at clinics. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79957596036	Pharmacotherapy of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy	Spasticity is a common disability in children with cerebral palsy. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotics, rhizotomy, and orthopedic surgery, all play important roles in the management of spasticity. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of available medications for treatment of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. Common medications include benzodiazepines, dantrolene sodium, baclofen, tizanidine, botulinum toxins, phenol, alcohol and intrathecal baclofen. In general, oral medications and intrathecal baclofen are used for treating generalized spasticity, whilst chemodenervation agents (botulinum toxins, phenol, and alcohol) are used to treat localized spasticity. There is more sufficient evidence for the recommendation of botulinum toxin A as an effective anti-spasticity treatment in children with cerebral palsy. However, more data concerning safety and long-term effects of botulinum toxin A is needed. Further study is needed to determine which kinds of medications can cause substantial improvement in daily activity, participation level, self-competence, or quality of life in children with cerebral palsy. © 2011 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

79959717426	Botulinum toxin type A on oral health in treating sialorrhea in children with cerebral palsy: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study	Intrasalivary gland injection of botulinum toxin type A is known to treat sialorrhea effectively in children with cerebral palsy. However, oral health may be compromised with escalating dose. In this randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled pilot trial, the authors aim to determine the therapeutic effect of low-dose, ultrasonography-controlled botulinum toxin type A injection to bilateral parotid and submandibular glands on oral health in the management of sialorrhea. Twenty children diagnosed with cerebral palsy were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The treatment group received botulinum toxin type A injections, whereas the control received normal saline in the same locations. The authors evaluated subjective drooling scales, salivary flow rate, and oral health (salivary compositions and cariogenic bacterial counts). A significant decrease was found in salivary flow rate at the 1- and 3-month follow-up in the botulinum toxin-treated group. The authors suggest that current protocol can effectively manage sialorrhea while maintaining oral health. © The Author(s) 2011.

79960831008	Developmental profiles and temperament patterns in children with spastic cerebral palsy: Relationships with subtypes and severity	Background/Purpose: Elucidating developmental profiles and temperament patterns in children with cerebral palsy (CP) could help clinicians elaborate more flexible strategies for treating these children. This study investigated the developmental profiles and temperament patterns in children with spastic CP (sCP) of different subtypes and severities. Methods: One hundred and five children, aged 3-6 years, with sCP and 66 children with typical development (TD) were analyzed. Children with sCP were classified into spastic diplegia (SD; n = 60), and spastic quadriplegia (SQ; n = 45) groups. Motor severity was classified via the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Development quotients (DQs) of eight domains and temperament scores of nine dimensions were evaluated. Results: The SQ group had lower DQs in all developmental functions than the SD group (p < 0.01). The DQ distributions of developmental profiles showed the same trend in SD and SQ groups, and both groups displayed lowest DQs in the gross motor domain. The SQ group was less adaptable and approachable than the TD group (p < 0.05), and both sCP groups had lower attention span and persistence and a higher threshold of responsiveness than the TD group (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that GMFCS levels were highly related to all developmental functions (r<-0.54, p < 0.01) and weakly related to some temperament dimensions in children with sCP. Conclusion: The subtype and severity of sCP were associated with developmental profiles in children with sCP. Temperament patterns were different between SD and SQ groups, but only weakly related to motor deficit. These data could allow clinicians to anticipate the developmental profiles and temperament patterns and plan appropriate therapeutic strategies for children with sCP. © 2011 Elsevier & Formosan Medical Association.

80053641823	Speech-associated labiomandibular movement in Mandarin-speaking children with quadriplegic cerebral palsy: A kinematic study	The purpose of this study was to investigate the speech-associated labiomandibular movement during articulation production in Mandarin-speaking children with spastic quadriplegic (SQ) cerebral palsy (CP). Twelve children with SQ CP (aged 7-11 years) and 12 age-matched healthy children as controls were enrolled for the study. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system. Kinematic parameters included utterance duration, displacement and velocity of the lip and jaw, coefficient of variation (CV) of lip utterance duration, and spatial and temporal coupling of labiomandibular movement of speech produced in mono-syllable (MS) and poly-syllable (PS) tasks. Children with CP showed lower temporal coupling (MS, p= 0.015; PS, p= 0.007), but not spatial coupling, of labiomandibular movement than healthy children. Children with CP had greater CVs (MS, p=0.003; PS, p= 0.010) and the peak opening displacement and velocity of lower lip and jaw (p< 0.05) and lower PCC (p< 0.001) than healthy children. Children with SQ CP displayed labiomandibular coupling movement impairment, especially in the aspect of temporal coupling. These children also had high temporal oromotor variability and needed to make more effort to coordinate the labiomandibular movement for speech production. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

82055172852	Validity, responsiveness, minimal detectable change, and minimal clinically important change of the Pediatric Motor Activity Log in children with cerebral palsy	This study examined criterion-related validity and clinimetric properties of the Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL) in children with cerebral palsy. Study participants were 41 children (age range: 28-113 months) and their parents. Criterion-related validity was evaluated by the associations between the PMAL and criterion measures at baseline and posttreatment, including the self-care, mobility, and cognition subscale, the total performance of the Functional Independence Measure in children (WeeFIM), and the grasping and visual-motor integration of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Responsiveness was examined using the paired . t test and the standardized response mean, the minimal detectable change was captured at the 90% confidence level, and the minimal clinically important change was estimated using anchor-based and distribution-based approaches. The PMAL-QOM showed fair concurrent validity at pretreatment and posttreatment and predictive validity, whereas the PMAL-AOU had fair concurrent validity at posttreatment only. The PMAL-AOU and PMAL-QOM were both markedly responsive to change after treatment. Improvement of at least 0.67 points on the PMAL-AOU and 0.66 points on the PMAL-QOM can be considered as a true change, not measurement error. A mean change has to exceed the range of 0.39-0.94 on the PMAL-AOU and the range of 0.38-0.74 on the PMAL-QOM to be regarded as clinically important change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study integrated a pair of instrumented shoes and a microprocessor-controlled data logger to build a portable system for measuring vertical foot-floor reaction forces. A series of tests was performed to validate the accuracy of the instrumented shoe system in measuring ground-reaction forces (GRFs) of individuals during level walking, and stair ascent and descent. Plantar forces of 5 healthy young (HY) adults and a stroke patient (SP) with good mobility were measured continuously during level walking, stair ascent and descent for up to 10 min. Their temporal and spatial gait parameters were calculated. The SP exhibited substantially longer stride time, and double support and single support periods during stair ambulation than the HY group. Furthermore, the SP demonstrated bilaterally asymmetrical force waveforms, center of pressure (COP) loci and temporal gait parameters. Experimental results indicate that the proposed shoe system can acquire accurate GRF data for an extended period. Based on GRF data, the system can generate data for temporal gait parameters, and GRF waveform and cyclogram patterns for clinical diagnosis of pathological gaits.

84857358103	Relationships of muscle strength and bone mineral density in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy	Summary: This work explores the relationships of muscle strength and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP). The knee extensor strength, but not motor function, was related to aBMD. Thus, muscle strength, especially antigravity muscle strength, was more associated with aBMD in these children than motor function. Introduction: Muscle strength is related to bone density in normal children. However, no studies have examined these relationships in ambulatory children with CP. This work explores the relationships of muscle strength and aBMD in ambulatory children with CP. Methods: Forty-eight ambulatory children with spastic CP, aged 5-15 years, were classified into two groups based on Gross Motor Function Classification System levels: I (n = 28) and II (n = 20). Another 31 normal development (ND) children were recruited as the comparison group for the aBMD. Children with CP underwent assessments of growth, lumbar and distal femur aBMD, Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66), and muscle strength of knee extensor and flexor by isokinetic dynamometer. Results: The distal femur aBMD, but not lumbar aBMD, was lower in children with CP than in ND children (p < 0.05). Children with level I had greater knee flexor strength and GMFM-66 scores than those with level II (p < 0.001). However, the knee extensor strength and distal femur and lumbar aBMD did not differ between two groups. Regression analysis revealed the weight and knee extensor strength, but not GMFM-66 scores, were related positively to the distal femur and lumbar aBMD (adjusted r

However, the nature of the task-specific impairments is needed to be clarified. The aim of this study was to describe handwriting capacity in ADHD children without DCD and identify underlying factors of performance by use of outcome-oriented assessments and a digitizing tablet. Twenty-one children with ADHD (8.59. ±. 1.25 years) and 21 match controls (8.5. ±. 1.08 years) were recruited. Children with ADHD scored lower than controls on Tseng Handwriting Problem Checklist and writing composite of Basic Reading and Writing Test, indicating the ADHD group wrote less legibly. The ADHD group spent more on-paper time to copy 50 Chinese characters and exhibited more writing time during the writing process. The ADHD group scored significantly lower on tasks demanding upper limb and eye-hand coordination and visual-motor integration compared with controls. Furthermore, motor skill and visual-motor integration were positively correlated with the legibility. Motor skill was negatively correlated with writing time, in-air time, and in-air trajectory. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84860120317	Pilot comparative study of unilateral and bilateral robot-assisted training on upper-extremity performance in patients with stroke	We compared a unilateral robot-assisted training protocol (URTP) and a bilateral robot-assisted training protocol (BRTP) to study their differential effects. We recruited 21 patients with stroke who received 90-105 min of therapy 5 days/wk for 4 wk. Participants in the URTP and BRTP groups practiced forearm pronation and supination and wrist flexion and extension in a simultaneous manner with the Bi-Manu-Track. The control group received standard rehabilitation. Clinical measures included the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Medical Research Council instrument, grip strength, and the Modified Ashworth Scale to assess motor impairment, muscle power, muscle strength, and spasticity, respectively. The pilot study indicated that the URTP and BRTP might have differential benefits for movement improvement. URTP might be a more compelling approach to improving upper-limb motor impairment, muscle power, and strength at the distal joints than BRTP, whereas BRTP could be an optimal approach to improving proximal muscle power.

84862800675	Muscle strength enhancement following home-based virtual cycling training in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy	This study is the first well-designed randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a novel home-based virtual cycling training (hVCT) program for improving muscle strength in children with spastic cerebral palsy (CP). Twenty-eight ambulatory children with spastic CP aged 6-12 years were randomly assigned to an hVCT group (. n=. 13) or a control group (. n=. 15). Outcome measures, including gross motor function of the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) and muscle strength (isokinetic torque of knee extensor and flexor muscle), were administered before and immediately after the 12-week intervention. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) at post-treatment showed that, compared to the control group, the hVCT group had significantly higher isokinetic torque in the knee extensor and flexor muscles at 60°/s and 120°/s angular velocities (. p<. 0.05). At post-treatment, the hVCT group also showed greater isokinetic strength improvement in the knee flexor than in the knee extensor at 60°/s (knee flexor: 41%; knee extensor: 19%) and at 120°/s (knee flexor: 36%; knee extensor: 30%). However, the BOTMP scores at post-treatment did not differ between the two groups. Although the proposed 12-week hVCT protocol does not improve gross motor function, it enhances knee muscle strength in children with CP. The protocol obtains larger gains in the knee flexor than in the knee extensor at different angular velocities. The study findings will help clinicians to provide more effective and efficient strategies for muscle strength training in children with CP. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862812338	Rasch validation and predictive validity of the action research arm test in patients receiving stroke rehabilitation	Objective: To validate the internal construct and predictive validity of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Design: Secondary study. Setting: Seven medical centers. Participants: Patients with stroke (N=191). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure: The internal construct validity of the ARAT score at pretreatment was examined using Rasch analysis. The predictive validity was examined by the correlations between performance on the ARAT before treatment and scores on the Wolf Motor Function Test, the Motor Activity Log, and the Stroke Impact Scale after treatment. Results: The 4-point ARAT scale had a disordered rating scale structure. Further Rasch modeling suggested revising the original 4-point scale into a 3-point scale. The 19 items measured 1 construct. The item difficulty hierarchy indicated that excluding the gross subtest, a score of 3 on the first item of any other subtest indicated the highest motor ability, and a score of 1 (the revised lowest rating) on the second item indicated the lowest motor ability. Tasks of "place hand behind head" and "place hand on top of head" showed poor item fit and item bias relevant to participants' ages. The ARAT items can reliably separate participants into 5.44 strata. Moderate to good correlations indicated good predictive validity. Conclusions: The ARAT possesses good psychometric properties in stroke patients with mild to moderate motor severity and without severe cognitive impairment, and has evidence of unidimensionality, predictive validity, and reliability. The revised 3-point rating scale is recommended when the ARAT is administered on this population. The "place hand behind head" and "place hand on top of head" tasks misfit the Rasch model's expectations. Future studies are needed in the use of the ARAT on stroke patients with different levels of motor severity or with cognitive impairment. © 2012 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.

84863120982	Health-related physical fitness management for a child with Tourette syndrome	Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurobiological disorder characterized by tics, which are repetitive, stereotypical, involuntary movements and vocalizations. Although the causes of TS are not completely understood, previous studies indicated that many children with TS not only experience comorbid conditions such as a lack of concentration, hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, but also demonstrate poorer motor skills than their peers with typical development. There is limited information on health-related fitness exercises and/or physical therapy for children with TS. A 12-year-old boy with TS demonstrated below-age appropriate motor function with a less optimal musculoskeletal condition, including pain in the posterior portion of both lower extremities. After performing individualized health-related physical fitness exercises, he demonstrated a better muscu-loskeletal condition and motor function. Unexpectedly, he reported he was able to suppress motor tics occasionally by doing stretching exercises. The results suggest that evaluation and management of health-related fitness may be helpful for children with TS. These promising results warrant further investigation of the impact of health-related physical exercises on children with TS.

84863258315	Managing spastic hypertonia in children with cerebral palsy via repetitive passive knee movements	Objective: Most children with cerebral palsy have increased muscle tension in the lower extremities, which inevitably leads to abnormal gait characteristics. Proper management of excessive muscle tension is therefore of great importance. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of continuous passive motion on children with cerebral palsy, regarding their lower extremity spastic hypertonia and ambulatory function. Design: A repeated measures design. Subjects: Sixteen children with cerebral palsy. Methods: Intervention was applied to the subject's knees with a continuous passive motion device (at velocities of 15 and 0°/s) for 20 min. Effects were evaluated via variables measuring range-of-motion, muscle tone, and ambulatory function before, immediately after, and 30 min after intervention. Results: For the 15°/s intervention, significant differences were found in time, intervention, and interaction among variables, including active range-of-motion of the knee (increased), relaxation index (increased), Modified Ashworth Scale (decreased), Timed Up-and-Go (decreased), and 6-Minute Walk test (increased). No difference was found in passive range of motion measurements. For the 0°/s control condition, none of the dependent variables demonstrated statistically significant differences. Conclusion: Repetitive passive movement can reduce lower extremity spastic hypertonia in children with cerebral palsy, and improve ambulatory function in terms of walking speed. © 2012 The Authors.

84864250004	Efficacy of constraint-induced therapy on functional performance and health-related quality of life for children with cerebral palsy: A randomized controlled trial	To better generalize training effects to the context of daily living, home-based constraint-induced therapy has been proposed. Therapeutic success of constraint-induced therapy is limited as to whether the improvements in functional performance can be transferred to quality of life. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy of home-based constraint-induced therapy on functional performance and health-related quality of life. Twenty-two children with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy (6-8 years, 10 boys) were randomly assigned to receive constraint-induced therapy or traditional rehabilitation. Home-based constraint-induced therapy had immediate and maintaining effects on motor efficacy and functional performance and induced greater gains in health-related quality of life in the long run than in the short term. The home-based constraint-induced therapy protocol (relatively moderate intensity and shortened constraint time), which might balance the effectiveness and compliance of participants and caregivers, may be an effective alternative to conventional constraint-induced therapy. © The Author(s) 2012.

84864374801	Knee muscle strength at varying angular velocities and associations with gross motor function in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy	The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships of muscle strength at different angular velocities and gross motor functions in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP). This study included 33 ambulatory children with spastic CP aged 6-15 years and 15 children with normal development. Children with CP were categorized into level I (n=17) or level II (n=16) according to Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels. All children underwent curl-up test and isokinetic tests of the knee extensor and flexor muscle. Children with CP underwent the gross motor function assessments, including the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and the gross motor subtests of Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP). The hamstring-quadriceps ratio (HQ ratio) was calculated as 100%×(isokinetic peak torque of hamstring (knee flexor)/isokinetic peak torque of quadriceps (knee extensor)). Children with GMFCS level II had lower BOTMP and GMFM-66 scores, curl-up scores, HQ ratio, and knee muscle strength, especially knee flexor, compared to those with GMFCS level I. The regression analysis showed that knee flexor torques at 60 and 90°/s are mainly related to balance (r

0036874158	Clinical analysis of 1048 children with developmental delay	Background: Children with developmental delay (DD) have a variety of problems in developmental functions. The purposes of this study were to analyze the underlying diseases and risk factors in children with different functional delays. Methods: We collected data on 1048 children who underwent assessments of developmental function, related diseases, and risk factors. All children were classified into 6 functional delay groups: cognitive, speech, motor, pervasive, global, and non-specific DDs. Differences in related diseases and risk factors of the 6 functional delay groups were determined. Results: Most children had global (51.2%), speech (21.9%), and motor (13.9%) delays. Approximately 62.8% of children were associated with biological factors (19% with genetic defects or congenital anomalies, 16.5% with central nervous system lesions, 13.9% with prematurity/low birth body weight, and 13.4% with neonatal insult). We could not identify the risk factors in 36.6% of the children. Most children with motor delay had brain/neuromuscular diseases and were associated with risks of prematurity or low birth body weight; while most children with global delay had brain neuromuscular diseases or psychological/mental disorders and were associated with risks of genetic defects or congenital anomalies. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there are heterogeneous risk factors and related diseases in children with different kinds of functional delay.

0037768797	Correlation of polyelectromyographic patterns and clinical motor manifestations in children with cerebral palsy	Objective: We investigated the correlation between movement patterns, measured by polyelectromyography (PEMG), and clinical motor manifestations in children with cerebral palsy. Design: Subjects included 53 children with spastic cerebral palsy (diplegic [n = 43] and quadriplegic [n = 10] groups) and 18 normal children. All children underwent PEMG assessments, recorded from pairs of flexor/extensor muscles during voluntary movement. We correlated PEMG patterns with clinical motor assessments, including muscle tone, range of motion, and ambulatory and functional capacities in the children with cerebral palsy. Results: Children with cerebral palsy exhibited four distinct PEMG patterns, ranging from partial reciprocal to complete synchrony. Lower PEMG pattern scores were significantly associated with better ambulatory (rho = 0.88, P < 0.01) and functional (rho = 0.78, P < 0.01) capacities. PEMG patterns also had weakly positive relationships with muscle tone (rho > 0.33, P < 0.01) and range of motion of both lower limbs (rho > 0.31, P < 0.01). Most children of spastic diplegia with PEMG patterns II and III had independent ambulatory capacities and mild limitation of functional capacity, whereas most children with pattern of IV and V had no ambulatory abilities and no independent functional capacities (P < 0.01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that PEMG patterns correlate with clinical motor deficits and may allow us to plan treatment strategies based on underlying motor control in cerebral palsy.

84868231284	Managing lower extremity muscle tone and function in children with cerebral palsy via eight-week repetitive passive knee movement intervention	This study used a repeated measures design to assess the effect of an eight-week repetitive passive movement (RPM) intervention on lower extremity muscle tone and function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Eighteen children (aged 9.5 ± 2.1 years) with spastic CP were randomly assigned to a knee RPM intervention condition of 3 times a week for 8 weeks or a control condition. The 8 weeks were followed by 4 weeks of washout period, after which the participants were crossed over to the other group. In the RPM condition, each subject's knees were intervened with continuous passive motion device (at a velocity of 15°/s) for 20. min. The subjects were evaluated via variables measuring range-of-motion, muscle tone, and ambulatory function before, after, 1 day after, and 3 days after each intervention. Repeated-measures statistical analyses found significant differences between condition variable on active range-of-motion of the knee (AROM, increased), relaxation index (RI, increased), Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS, decreased), timed up-and-go (TUG, decreased), 6-min walk test (6MWT, increased); and significant differences among time variable including RI, MAS, and 6MWT. No difference was found in passive range-of-motion measurements. Repetitive passive movement reduced lower extremity spastic hypertonia in children with cerebral palsy, and it also improved ambulatory function in terms of walking speed. Effects of this treatment protocol on ambulation lasted up to 3 days post intervention. Findings of this study provide clinicians and patients an alternative, effective and efficient strategy for spastic control and ambulatory improvement. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869776912	Potential predictors of changes in gross motor function during various tasks for children with cerebral palsy: A follow-up study	Very few studies have investigated predictors of change in various gross motor outcomes in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP). The aim of this study was to identify potential predictors for change in gross motor outcomes measured during various tasks in children with CP. A group of 45 children (age, 6-15 years) with CP and 7 potential predictors were identified, including age, gender, CP subtypes, gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels, abdominal muscle endurance, and muscles strength of knee extensor and knee flexor measured by isokinetic dynanometer. Motor outcome was assessed by means of the gross motor composite (GMC) of Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP), including four gross motor subtests: running speed and agility (RSA), balance (BAL), bilateral coordination (BCO), and strength (STR). The outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-week later (follow-up). The regression analyses showed that knee extensor strength was a robust predictor of change in BAL, BCO, and GMC (adjusted R

84871958329	Logistic regression analyses for predicting clinically important differences in motor capacity, motor performance, and functional independence after constraint-induced therapy in children with cerebral palsy	Given the growing evidence for the effects of constraint-induced therapy (CIT) in children with cerebral palsy (CP), there is a need for investigating the characteristics of potential participants who may benefit most from this intervention. This study aimed to establish predictive models for the effects of pediatric CIT on motor and functional outcomes. Therapists administered CIT to 49 children (aged 3-11 years) with CP. Sessions were 1-3.5. h a day, twice a week, for 3-4 weeks. Parents were asked to document the number of restraint hours outside of the therapy sessions. Domains of treatment outcomes included motor capacity (measured by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales II), motor performance (measured by the Pediatric Motor Activity Log), and functional independence (measured by the Pediatric Functional Independence Measure). Potential predictors included age, affected side, compliance (measured by time of restraint), and the initial level of motor impairment severity. Tests were administered before, immediately after, and 3 months after the intervention. Logistic regression analyses showed that total amount of restraint time was the only significant predictor for improved motor capacity immediately after CIT. Younger children who restrained the less affected arm for a longer time had a greater chance to achieve clinically significant improvements in motor performance. For outcomes of functional independence in daily life, younger age was associated with clinically meaningful improvement in the self-care domain. Baseline motor abilities were significantly predictive of better improvement in mobility and cognition. Significant predictors varied according to the aspects of motor outcomes after 3 months of follow-up. The potential predictors identified in this study allow clinicians to target those children who may benefit most from CIT. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84871653461	Rasch validation of a combined measure of basic and extended daily life functioning after stroke	Background. Tools used to measure poststroke functional status must include basic and instrumental activities of daily living and reflect the patient's and the clinician's perspective of the disease and its effect on daily living performance. Objective. The authors combined the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) to create a scale providing a comprehensive evaluation of ADLs functional status in patients with stroke. Methods. The study participants were 188 patients completing the FIM and the NEADL. The psychometric properties of the combined measure were examined with Rasch analysis. Results. A 3-point scale and a dichotomous scale were suggested for use in the FIM and the NEADL, respectively. The combined 40 items worked consistently to reflect a single construct, and "bladder management" and "bowel management" were highly related. After "bowel management" was removed from the combined scale, all but 3 items fit the model's expectations, and the 39-item scale showed reasonable item difficulty hierarchy, with high reliability. The 3 misfit items were removed, and no differences in unidimensionality, differential item functioning, and reliability were found between the 36-item and 39-item scales. Conclusions. The combined measure of the FIM and the NEADL provides a comprehensive picture of ADLs. It extends the utility of the FIM and the NEADL and is recommended for use to measure the independence of patients after discharge home. © The Author(s) 2013.

84872003313	Validity, responsiveness, minimal detectable change, and minimal clinically important change of Pediatric Balance Scale in children with cerebral palsy	This study examined criterion-related validity and clinimetric properties of the pediatric balance scale (PBS) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Forty-five children with CP (age range: 19-77 months) and their parents participated in this study. At baseline and at follow up, Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine criterion-related validity by analyzing the correlation between the PBS, including PBS-static, PBS-dynamic, and PBS-total, and criterion measures, including the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 items (GMFM-66) and Functional Independence Measures for Children (WeeFIM). Responsiveness was examined by paired t test and by standardized response mean (SRM). The minimal detectable change (MDC) was analyzed at the 90% confidence level, and the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) was estimated by anchor-based and distribution-based approaches. The PBS with GMFM-66 and WeeFIM showed fair-to-excellent concurrent validity at pretreatment and follow up and predictive validity. The SRM values of all PBS scales were 0.75. For the PBS-static, PBS-dynamic, and PBS-total, the MDC

84873930717	Effect of therapist-based constraint-induced therapy at home on motor control, motor performance and daily function in children with cerebral palsy: A randomized controlled study	Objective: To determine the effect of therapist-based constraint-induced therapy at home on motor performance, daily function and reaching control for children with cerebral palsy. Design: A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Subjects: Forty-seven children (23 boys; 24 girls) with unilateral cerebral palsy, aged 6-12 years, were randomized to constraint-induced therapy (n = 24) or traditional rehabilitation (n = 23). Interventions: Constraint-induced therapy involved intensive functional training of the more affected arm while the less affected arm was restrained. Traditional rehabilitation involved functional unilateral and bilateral arm training. Both groups received individualized therapist-based interventions at home for 3.5-4 hours/day, two days a week for four weeks. Main measures: Motor performance and daily function were measured by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Second Edition and the Pediatric Motor Activity Log. Reaching control was assessed by the kinematics of reaction time, movement time, movement unit and peak velocity. Results: There were larger effects in favour of constraint-induced therapy on motor performance, daily function, and some aspects of reaching control compared with traditional rehabilitation. Children receiving constraint-induced therapy demonstrated higher scores for Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, Second Edition - Grasping (pretest mean ± SD, 39.9 ± 3.1; posttest, 44.1 ± 2.8; P < 0.001), Pediatric Motor Activity Log (pretest, 1.8 ± 0.3; posttest, 2.5 ± 0.3; P < 0.001) and shorter reaction time, normalized movement time (P < 0.001) and higher peak velocity (P = 0.004) of reaching movement. Conclusions: Constraint-induced therapy induced better grasping performance, daily function, and temporal and spatiotemporal control of reaching in children with unilateral cerebral palsy than traditional rehabilitation. © 2012 The Author(s).

84874258805	The dual pathway of professional attitude among health care workers serving HIV/AIDS patients and drug users	The professional attitude of health care workers (HCWs) who serve HIV/AIDS patients and drug users is important in implementation of the harm reduction program (HRP). This study was to explore the causal relationships between education and training, AIDS-related knowledge, attitude of supporting methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), risk perception, and professional attitude of HCWs toward serving HIV/AIDS patients and drug users. We distributed a self-administered questionnaire to HCWs who have served HIV/AIDS patients and drug users due to work in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test various pathways regarding the professional attitudes of HIV/AIDS patients and drug users among HCWs. A total of 218 HCWs were eligible for this study. The dual pathway model was emerged: (1) have attended education and training courses regarding to HRP positively and significantly affects professional attitude via the attitude of supporting MMT. The correlation (r) was 0.27 between education and training and the attitude of SMMT, and was 0.42 between the attitude of SMMT and professional attitude. (2) AIDS-related knowledge negatively and significantly affects professional attitude via risk perception of contracting HIV. The correlation was -0.22 between AIDS-related knowledge and risk perception, and was -0.25 between risk perception and professional attitude. Various fit indices confirmed a reasonable and acceptable fit of the model. Balance theory and approach-avoidance conflict may partially explain the dual pathways of professional attitude of HCWs toward serving HIV/AIDS patients and drug users. Our result suggests that, among HCWs, education and training courses regarding to HRP are important in increasing the attitude SMMT and AIDS-related knowledge directly, thus, professional attitude serving HIV/AIDS patients and drug users can be enhanced indirectly. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84874684665	Clinimetric properties of the Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation in children with cerebral palsy	This study examines the criterion-related validity and clinimetric properties of the Assessment of Preschool Children's Participation (APCP) for children with cerebral palsy (CP). Eighty-two children with CP (age range, two to five years and 11 months) and their caregivers participated in this study. The APCP consists of diversity and intensity scores in the areas of play (PA), skill development (SD), active physical recreation (AP), social activities (SA), and total areas. Tests were administered at baseline and at six-month follow-up. Concurrent and predictive validities were identified by assessing the strength of correlations between APCP scores and criterion-related measures-the 66-item Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). Responsiveness was measured by standardized response mean (SRM). Minimal detectable change (MDC) at the 95% confidence level (MDC

84876487271	Efficacy of home-based virtual cycling training on bone mineral density in ambulatory children with cerebral palsy	Summary: The 12-week home-based virtual cycling training (hVCT) improved lower limb muscle strength and areal bone mineral density (aBMD) than the control program in children with cerebral palsy (CP). A muscle strengthening program, rather than general physical activity, is more specific in enhancing aBMD for these children. A novel hVCT is an effective and efficient strategy that enhances lower limb bone density in these children. Introduction: This is the first study to assess the efficacy of a novel hVCT program on bone density for children with spastic CP using a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Methods: Twenty-seven ambulatory children with spastic CP, aged 6-12 years, were randomly assigned to the hVCT group (n = 13) or control group (n = 14). Outcome measures - motor function [Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66)], muscle strength (curl up scores and isokinetic torque of knee extensor and flexor muscle) and aBMD of the lumbar and distal femur - were administered before and immediately after the 12-week intervention. Results: Analysis of covariance results show that the hVCT group had greater distal femur aBMD and isokinetic torques of knee extensor and flexor muscles than the control group at posttreatment (p < 0.05). However, curl up scores, GMFM-66, and lumbar aBMD at posttreatment did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions: Analytical findings suggest that the muscle strengthening program is more specific in enhancing bone density for children with CP than general physical activity. Thus, the proposed 12-week hVCT protocol is an effective and efficient strategy for improving lower limb aBMD in these children. © 2012 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.

84880145475	Validity and clinimetric properties of the spinal alignment and range of motion measure in children with cerebral palsy	Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the validity, responsiveness, and clinimetric properties of the Spinal Alignment and Range of Motion Measure (SAROMM) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Method: Sixty-two children with CP (40 males, 22 females) with a median age of 3 years and 11 months (range 1-6y) and their caregivers participated in this study. Among the children, 56 had spastic CP while six had non-spastic CP; 53 had bilateral CP, while nine had unilateral limb involvement. Thirty-three children were classified as Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels I to III and 23 as levels IV or V. Fifty-six children (90%) received regular rehabilitation by means of regular physical or occupational therapy (50% once or twice per week and 40% more than two times per week) and six children (10%) received irregular rehabilitation (less than once a week). Construct validity was determined by assessing the strength of the correlation between the spinal alignment SAROMM (SAROMM-SA), the range of motion SAROMM (SAROMM-ROM), and the total SAROMM (SAROMM-total), and construct measures, including the 66-item Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) and Functional Independence Measures for Children (WeeFIM), at baseline and at 6-months follow-up. Responsiveness was examined using effect size. Minimal detectable change (MDC) at the 90% confidence level (MDC90) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) were analysed. Results: The SAROMM with the GMFM-66 and WeeFIM had fair to good construct validity. The effect size values of all SAROMM scales were 0.24 to 0.48. The MDC90 values and MCID range were 1.43 and 0.47 to 1.67 for the SAROMM-SA, 3.12 and 3.68 to 4.07 for the SAROMM-ROM, and 3.22 and 4.53 to 4.62 for the SAROMM-total. Interpretation: The clinimetric properties of the SAROMM allow clinicians to determine whether a change in SAROMM score represents a clinically meaningful change. © 2013 Mac Keith Press.

0344851731	Gait Performance with Compensatory Adaptations in Stroke Patients with Different Degrees of Motor Recovery	Objective: Gait patterns vary among stroke patients. This study attempted to discover gait performance with compensatory adaptations in stroke patients with different degrees of motor recovery. Design: Data were gathered from 35 stroke patients and 15 healthy subjects. Gait performance and motor recovery were assessed 6 mos after stroke. Stroke patients further were divided into poor and good groups. The walking velocity was correlated with Brunnström's stages, and the temporal stride and motion variables of the two groups were compared. Results: Walking velocity was positively correlated with the Brunnström's stages of the proximal lower limb. The poor group displayed slower walking velocity and shorter single-support time compared with the good group. Both groups displayed low maximum excursion of hip extension and ankle plantar-flexion during the stance phase and low maximum excursion of hip and knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase. Moreover, both groups displayed excessive pelvic tilts during the stance and swing phases. However, the poor group displayed different pelvic motion and timing sequences to each peak joint angle from normal subjects and the good group. Peak hip and knee angles of the affected limb during the stance phase occurred almost simultaneously in this group. Conclusions: Selective control of the proximal lower limb may be the main determinant of walking velocity. The compensatory adaptations were similar, except for pelvic motion, in stroke patients with different levels of motor recovery, whereas the poor group walked with synergistic mass patterns and reduced stability.

0342579974	Gait analysis through foot pattern recognition for children with cerebral palsy	In this study, we simplified the analysis of kinetic gait data using pattern recognition. Gait patterns were studied in 42 spastic children with cerebral palsy (age range: 3 to 17 years old), and 24 age- and sex-matched children. Gait analysis was performed using the DynoGraphy (CDG) system (Infortronic, Holland). The foot enrollment and the role of the heel or forefoot were assessed to form the gaitline. The bipedal phase was examined using a cyclogram, which is a cyclic characteristic formed by the changing position of the application point of the resultant normal force on a vertical supporting horizontal plane during motion. Based on the pattern recognition, the gait patterns of the subjects could be classified into 4 different patterns in both the gaitline and the cyclogram. The classification of the gait was parallel to the clinical evaluation of cerebral palsy obtained based on Minear's classification of daily activity (p < 0.05). The correlation between the gaitline and cyclogram was also highly significant (p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that an automated pattern recognition program might provide an additional method for comprehensive gait evaluation in children with cerebral palsy. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

84893784673	The role of trait impulsivity in response inhibition: Event-related potentials in a stop-signal task	The study examined the relation between self-reported impulsivity and inhibitory control in normal individuals. We compared stopping performance and neural correlates of stopping on stop-signal task between participants who scored in the top (n. =. 12) and bottom 25% (n. =. 12) on Impulsivity Scale from a sample of 305 male adults. Participants scoring high on impulsivity did not show impaired inhibitory control. However, it seems that the high impulsive tended to make more errors of commission and omission. Enhanced N1 amplitudes were found in successful than failed inhibition trials. The high impulsive group had smaller P3 amplitude than the low impulsive group. It appears that the high impulsive group may have a less efficient inhibitory control. Impulsivity Scale non-planning impulsiveness score and inattention score of Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) were negatively correlated with P3 amplitudes on successful inhibition trails, suggesting that impulsivity could have the potential influence on inhibitory control. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84894211477	Symptoms and distress among patients with liver cirrhosis but without hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan	A cross-sectional study design was used to assess the items and frequency of physical symptoms and psychological distress among patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) but without hepatocellular carcinoma. Inpatients with LC were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan. Informants were asked to describe their frequency of symptoms and distress at 2 weeks before admission. During August 2008 and July 2009, 49 patients participated. The symptoms and distress were moderate, with a mean of 3.9 and 4.2 of 7, respectively. The mean ranking of subscales from the highest to lowest was abdominal symptoms, fatigue, fluid retention, loss of appetite, systemic symptoms, decreased attention, and bleeding. Symptoms and distress were significantly correlated (r = .59). The total scores of symptoms and distress were not associated with causes of the disease (p = .7644, p = .8548, respectively), disease severity (p = .7203, p = .3354, respectively), disease duration (p = .5820, p = .8184, respectively), or previous admission (p = .3094, p = .7365, respectively), but decreased attention was significantly associated with disease severity (p = .0317) and systemic symptoms were significantly associated with disease duration (p = .0267). The study found that physical symptoms and psychological distress are multidimensional and highly correlated. Our findings can be used to develop a symptom management program to relieve discomfort and indirectly improve the quality of life for individuals with LC. © 2014 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.

84896266449	Potential predictors of functional outcomes after home-based constraint-induced therapy for children with cerebral palsy	OBJECTIVE. Our objective was to identify predictors for treatment outcomes after home-based constraintinduced therapy (CIT) in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHOD. Forty-three children (aged 4 12 yr) with CP were treated with individualized CIT at home for 4 wk. Potential predictors were age, sex, affected hand, and upper-extremity motor capacity measured by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, 2nd edition (PDMS 2). Outcomes were the Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL) Amount of Hand Use and Quality of Hand Use subscales and the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM). RESULTS. A higher PDMS 2 Visual Motor Integration subscale score predicted a better WeeFIM score after home-based CIT (adjusted R2 5 .35). Younger age predicted better performance on the PMAL Amount of Hand Use and Quality of Hand Use subscales (adjusted R2 5 .06 .08) after home-based CIT. CONCLUSION. The potential predictors may allow occupational therapy practitioners to target those children who will benefit most after home-based constraint-induced therapy.

84901976633	Motor impairments screened by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 are related to the visual-perceptual deficits in children with Developmental Coordination Disorder	This study was to examine to what extent the motor deficits of children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) verified by the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 (MABC-2) are linked to their visual-perceptual abilities. Seventeen children with DCD and seventeen typically developing children (TD) aged 5-10 years screened from a total of 250 children were recruited. The assessments included MABC-2, traditional test of visual perceptual skills (TVPS-R), and computerized test for sequential coupling of eye and hand as well as motion coherence. The results indicated that children with DCD scored lower than TD in MABC-2, and their total scores were highly correlated with manual dexterity component scores. DCD group also showed poor visual-perceptual abilities in various aspects. The visual discrimination and visual sequential memory from the TVPS-R, the sequential coupling of eye and hand, and the motion coherence demonstrated a moderate or strong correlation with the MABC-2 in the DCD rather than the TD group. It was concluded that the motor problems screened by MABC-2 were significantly related to the visual-perceptual deficits of children with DCD. MABC-2 is suggested to be a prescreening tool to identify the visual-perceptual related motor deficits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

0347419017	Leg Muscle Activation Patterns of Sit-to-Stand Movement in Stroke Patients	Objective: To describe the characteristics of leg muscle activation patterns in hemiplegic stroke patients during the movement of rising from a chair and to determine the differences of leg muscle activation patterns between stroke fallers and nonfallers. Design: Subjects stood up from an armless chair at a comfortable, self-paced speed. Leg muscle activation time and patterns during the sit-to-stand movement were analyzed using multichannel surface electromyography and a force platform. The differences between stroke fallers and nonfallers were compared. Results: The mean onset time of muscle activity in the affected limbs of stroke fallers was markedly delayed for the tibialis anterior muscle and earlier for the soleus muscle. The muscle activation patterns in the affected side of the stroke fallers exhibited a wide range of variation. Seventy percent of our stroke fallers exhibited no or merely low-amplitude activity in their tibialis anterior muscle when the patients were rising from a chair. Half of the stroke fallers exhibited premature or excessive activation of their soleus muscle when the rising activity was initiated. Conclusions: Stroke patients who exhibited no or low-amplitude muscle activity in the tibialis anterior, associated with premature or excessive activation of the soleus muscle in their hemiplegic limbs, when rising from a chair were prone to falling. The compensatory excessive tibialis anterior and quadriceps muscle activation in the unaffected limbs of stroke patients might have a role in preventing them from falling.

We report the linguistic and gait disorders in a child with Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome associated with left temporal and parietal hypoplasia as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. Our patient was mildly mentally retarded, scoring better on the performance subtest than on the verbal subtest. He received serial assessments for developmental, language, speech, and gait functions, before and after rehabilitation, at age 4.5 and 6 yr, respectively. After comprehensive rehabilitation, the boy achieved improvement in speech, language, fine motor, and gait functions. Early comprehensive rehabilitation programs seem beneficial for improving functional development for children with Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome.

11144284873	The relationship of social function with motor and speech functions in children with autism	Background: Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder, characterized by pervasive impairment in several areas of development, including social interactions and communication skills. The purpose of this study was to investigate the development profiles and determine the relationship of social function with motor and speech functions in children with autism. Methods: We collected the medical records of 32 children with autism. We used the Chinese Children Developmental Inventory (CCDI) to assess eight functional domains including: gross motor (GM), fine motor (FM), expressive language (EL), concept comprehension (CC), social comprehension (SC), self help (SH), personal social (PS), and general development (GD). The children were classified into group A if the PS development quotient (DQ) was equal to or higher than 50%, or they were classified into group B if the PSDQ was lower than 50%. We compared the DQ between the two groups. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The developmental functions, including motor, speech, and self help functions in the autism group with high social function were better than those in the autism group with low social function. The DQs of all developmental function in group A (60-88%) were higher than those in group B (28-57%) (p<0.01). The gross motor and fine motor functions were better than speech and social function by 20 to 37% in both groups. Correlation analysis among developmental functions showed significant correlation (r=0.46-0.94, p<0.01). Using a stepwise linear regression test, the PS function was highly correlated with SC (r2=0.832, p<0.001). Conclusions: Autism is a multifaceted and disproportional developmental disorder. Social communication may play the dominant role in determining the social functions in children with autism.

The non-target condition consisted of four-chord harmonic chord sequences, while the target condition was manifested by a partially violating third chord and a resolving fourth chord. The results showed that the specific mismatch negativity (MMN) elicited in the resolving chord is as robust as that elicited in the partially violating chord. Moreover, the P3b (P300) elicited in the resolving chord was smaller than the one in the violating chord. Taken together these data indicates that the human brain pre-attentatively may be able to anticipate a subsequent resolving chord when music expectation is generated by a partially violating chord. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.
