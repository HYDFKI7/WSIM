1942455928	Dressing of resin-bonded superabrasive grinding wheels by means of acousto-optic Q-switched pulsed Nd:YAG laser	The preparation of the use of resin-bonded superabrasive grinding wheels remains a problem despite their availabilities on the market in the past years and possible technological advantages. In this paper, an acousto-optic Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser is applied to dressing resin-bonded superabrasive wheels in orthogonal direction. The author proposes a systematical study on the mechanism of selective removal, crater ablated by single pulse and surface topography after dressing, and consequently presents a feasible method of selecting irradiation parameters and summarizes the dressing features and disciplines of dressing effects influenced by these parameters. Experiments results indicate the surface topography dressed by acousto-optic Q-switched YAG pulsed laser dressing is much superior to mechanical dressing and CW laser dressing. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

34250341802	Ablation mechanism of bronze-bonded diamond wheels dressing by pulsed laser	Bronze bonded diamond wheel has superior grinding performances. It has to be brought into dressing for grinding before its first use or when reaching the service life criterion. Due to the thermal physical and optical differences between bronze bond and diamond abrasive, suitable pulse power density is selected to remove bonds and protrude thus realizing the selective removal. A heat transfer and gas dynamic model was created to describe single pulsed laser ablation which was occurred in the experiments of dressing bronze-bonded diamond wheel by acoustic-optic Q-switched YAG pulsed laser. The average temperature and thickness of melted layer, ablation velocity and depth by different laser power densities were calculated with numerical method. The model is proved to be correct by contrast with the experimental result.

84861570690	Characteristics of zinc behavior during laser welding of zinc "sandwich" sample	To address the problem of the zinc being easily gasified in laser welding of galvanized steel, laser welding of a zinc "sandwich" sample was performed to experimentally investigate the behavior and characteristics of the zinc inside and outside the keyhole, including the observation of the keyhole, the zinc vapor and zinc plasma, and the calculation of the electron temperature of the zinc plasma. Based on the principle of imaging amplification, the detected multi-points can be located precisely in order to study the distribution of the electron temperature of the zinc plasma. The results show that the zinc behavior played an important role in the formation of the weld-joint and the zinc plasma altered the energy distribution at the top of the keyhole whose diameter has been enlarged in the welding process. For both continuous-wave laser and pulsed laser welding of zinc "sandwich" sample, the average electron temperature of the zinc keyhole plasma was higher than that of the zinc plasma plume outside the keyhole. In the welding process, the continuous wave laser with higher input energy results in higher position of the zinc plasma with higher electron temperature above the sample surface. More zinc vapor resulted in a higher average electron temperature of the plasma. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.

84897999627	Relationship between spatter formation and dynamic molten pool during high-power deep-penetration laser welding	The spatter and the molten pool behavior, which were the important phenomena concerned with the welding quality, were observed and studied by using the high-speed camera and the X-ray transmission imaging system during laser welding under different welding parameters. The formation mechanism of spatter and the corresponding relationships between the spatter and molten pool behavior were investigated. The increase of laser power could cause more intense evaporation and lead to more spatter. When the focal position of laser beam was changed, different forms of spatter were generated, as well as the flow trends of molten metal on the front keyhole wall and at the rear molten pool were changed. The results revealed that the behavior of molten pool, which could be affected by the absorbed energy distribution in the keyhole, was the key factor to determine the spatter formation during laser welding. The relatively sound weld seam could be obtained during laser welding with the focal position located inside the metal. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Weld topography and cross section of different butt joint gaps are analyzed. And mechanical properties, microstructure and microhardness of weld are tested. Laser butt joint welding of a three-dimensional body part under optimized process is carried out. Crash tests are performed after welding experiments. The results of laser welding experiments prove that weld with good appearance and narrow heat affected zone (HAZ) can be obtained when butt joint gap is narrower than 18% (about 57.6% of focused spot diameter) of sheet thickness under the proper welding condition. When butt joint gap is narrower than 16% (about 51.2% of focused spot diameter) of sheet thickness, the tensile strength of weld is better than the base metal. Different butt joint gaps have no significant effect on the micro-hardness and microstructure of the weld. The crash tests prove that crash strength of laser welds is in accordance with the design standards. Fiber laser butt welding is better than arc butt welding for a three-dimensional body part.

The laser lap welding test was carried out based on the DC56D+ZF galvanized steel with thickness of 1.2 mm and the 6016 aluminum alloy with the fiber laser. The Matlab software was used, according to the actual situation of welding process, the steel and aluminum dissimilar metal laser welding pool shapes of the mathematical model in the flight quasi-steady state was established under a certain basic assumption. Based on the quasi-steady numerical equations, the shape of molten pool geometry distribution was obtained. The welding process parameters were adjusted through the experiments to get the best welding forming. By optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry, the microstructure, element distribution and phase composition of the steel/aluminum interface were studied. The results show that when the welding beam irradiates at the aluminum-seam interface, the welding power and welding speed have great influence on pool geometry. With the laser power increasing, the penetration increases; while with the welding speed increasing, the penetration depth becomes shallow. When the welding power is 1600-1800 W, the welding speed v is 30 mm/s and the defocus distance D is 0 mm, the best forming of welding is obtained, no cracks, holes and other defects are seen, and there is a bench-shape structure in the welding joint area. In the platform area, there is obvious boundary between the steel and aluminum. The interface bonding relies on the liquid aluminum on the wetting, filling and spreading of steel surface. In the concave region, the steel/aluminum fusion is better. The width is large for Fe and Al elements mixing zone, and FeAl brittle intermetallic compounds do not form, the thermal diffusion bonding between Fe and Al is the main reason for the region.

The experimental results indicate that there were the critical values of beam incident angle and joint gap during laser overlap welding of galvanized steel. The thickness of sheet and the width of joint had a certain influence on the critical beam incident angle and the limit joint gap. With regard to thicker sheet, the limit joint gap can increase appropriately, but the critical beam incident angle should not be too big. With narrow weld width, the laser beam incident angle can increase appropriately, but the joint gap should not be bigger. Additionally, the critical beam incident angle and the limit joint gap were varied with the thickness of the upper sheet. The tensile-shear tests show that the maximum tensile-shear strength of the joint can be obtained with an optimized beam incident angle and joint gap. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The emergence of laser-induced plasma in laser welding reveals important information of the welding technological process. Generally, electron temperature and electron density are two important characteristic parameters of plasma.

In this study, the author used a piece of transparent material GG17 glass to perform a direct observation of the dynamics in laser drilling. This technique enabled us to analyze the developmental process of elongated keyhole formation and the flow characteristics of the vapor and molten materials in the keyhole. Subsequently, the various features associated with laser drilling velocity and depth and the influence of laser power and defocus distance on the drilling velocity were investigated in experiments. In addition, to simulate the process of material vaporization removal during laser drilling process, a finite element model was established for laser drilling with Gaussian heating. To compensate for the multiple reflection of the laser on the keyhole wall and the energy loss during the drilling process, a convergence function, a coordination function and a factor function were introduced at the same time to model the changes of the laser energy and its intensity distribution as it reached the keyhole bottom. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The phase composition, microstructure, as well as abrasive and sliding wear performance of the as-sprayed coatings were investigated. The degree of tungsten carbide (WC) decarburization in the as-sprayed coatings increases while the coating porosity decreases with the increase of the propylene flow. The coating hardness, fracture toughness, resistance to abrasive and sliding wear increases with the increase of the propylene flow, reaches maximum and then decreases. At the low flow of the propylene, relatively loose coating microstructure is formed, which leads to fracturing and pulling off the WC particles during abrasive and sliding wear process. Herewith, at the high flow of the propylene, the high degree of the WC decarburization and high brittleness of the coating leads to micro-cutting during abrasive wear as well as to cracking and delamination of the coating in the sliding wear process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879684948	Observation of spatter formation mechanisms in high-power fiber laser welding of thick plate	This paper aims to present the dynamic behaviors of spatter formation, and to clarify the spatter formation mechanisms in the high-power fiber laser welding of a thick plate at low welding speeds. We used a modified "sandwich" specimen to directly observe the geometry of the longitudinal keyhole wall. The dynamic behaviors of the keyhole, vapor plume, and melt pool with the formation of spatters were observed using high-speed imaging. The mechanisms of the formation of the spatter ejected from the top and bottom surfaces were analyzed. The recoil momentum associated with the energized vapor plume jet acts on the tips of the gauffers on the front keyhole wall and micro-droplets inside the keyhole, thereby resulting in the formation of high-speed micro-spatter. At partial penetration, the spatter ejected from the keyhole inlet is influenced mainly by the upward melt flow above the keyhole, melt displacement around the keyhole, and the strong shear stream of the directed vapor plume force. Moreover, some spatter droplets are accelerated through the vapor plume outside the keyhole. At full penetration of the melt, spatters are generated when the downward momentum of the melt due to downward flow and gravity, or vapor burst with an open keyhole, exceeds the surface tension forces. At full penetration of the keyhole, the crucial driving force for spatter generation is the viscous friction drag associated with high-speed motion of the energized vapor plume through the open keyhole. The welding process evolves into almost a cutting process at a lower welding speed. Crown Copyright ©2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Space-resolved spectra in a wavelength range of 500-600 nm are measured at different laser average powers and pulse repetition frequencies, and the intensity of spectral lines achieves a maximum intensity at about 2.4 mm away from the surface of the grinding wheel.

There is, therefore, a need to find a good method suitable for the dressing of these wheels. This paper presents a new method dressed by an acoustic-optic Q-switched Nd: YAG laser based on thermal interaction, which is unlike the conventional mechanical dressing methods based on force interaction.

Experiments of a single pulse ablation on the resin bond and the CBN grains, and the laser dressing of resin-bonded CBN wheels with different dressing parameters have been carried out. The grinding force has been compared for the conventional mechanical dressed wheel and the laser dressed wheel. It is shown that the resin-bonded CBN grinding wheel is suitable for an acoustic-optic Q-switched Nd: YAG laser dressing with radial irradiation, which is better than a continuous wave (CW) laser dressing with radial irradiation and conventional mechanical dressing methods.

84889047934	Dynamic keyhole profile during high-power deep-penetration laser welding	Based on a butt-joint configuration assembled from transparent glass and stainless steel, the dynamic keyhole profile was observed during 10-kW fiber laser welding. The "gauffers" and vapor flow on the front keyhole wall moved downwards to the bottom of the keyhole. The downward-flowing vapor met the upward-flowing vapor at the bottom of the keyhole, which resulted in a whirlpool of vapor. The suspended droplets were drove to move in a random fashion by the whirlpool. The fluctuating vapor flow and pressure were the key factors causing the fluctuating keyhole wall and resulting in a vapor-generated wave (VGW) on the rear keyhole wall. The dynamic VGW was a very important factor affecting the dynamic welding process. When the VGW broke at the keyhole outlet, it was accompanied by swellings, spatter, columns, a decrease of the diameter of keyhole inlet, and a change in the direction of plume. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84890968653	Processing parameter optimization for the laser dressing of bronze-bonded diamond wheels	In this paper, a pulsed fiber-laser dressing method for bronze-bonded diamond wheels was studied systematically and comprehensively. The mechanisms for the laser dressing of bronze-bonded diamond wheels were theoretically analyzed, and the key processing parameters that determine the results of laser dressing, including the laser power density, pulse overlap ratio, ablation track line overlap ratio, and number of scanning cycles, were proposed for the first time. Further, the effects of these four key parameters on the oxidation-damaged layer of the material surface, the material removal efficiency, the material surface roughness, and the average protrusion height of the diamond grains were explored and summarized through pulsed laser ablation experiments. Under the current experimental conditions, the ideal values of the laser power density, pulse overlap ratio, ablation track line overlap ratio, and number of scanning cycles were determined to be 4.2 × 10

84891887028	Study on improving surface quality of weld of autogenously laser welding of thick plate with high power fiber laser	In the process of autogenously welding of SUS 304 stainless steel plate with 12-mm thickness using high power fiber laser, because the welding pool can not maintain homeostasis in the combined action of gravity, surface tension and vapor recoil, the flow of the liquid metal in the molten pool is drastic and the poor formation is easy to cause welding defects of its surface such as spatters, surface undercut and root hump. With certain welding power and top protection gas with certain flow rate, the influences of the welding speeding, defocus, butt joint gap and the flow rate of bottom shielding gas on welding quality by changing the single variable are discussed. The results show that adopting some reasonable technology measures can efficiently improve the welding quality, make the welding surface smooth and well-distributed, and reduce following machining amount after being welded. Tensile test shows that ductile fracture happens in parent metal place, far away from the weld. The maximum tensile stress is 809 MPa, and the mechanical performance of the weld is good.

84892696571	Experimental study of phenomena and multiple reflections during inclined laser irradiating	The phenomena during inclined laser irradiating on the metal surface were investigated to imitate the behaviour on the front keyhole wall in deep penetration laser welding. The results revealed that the velocity of molten layer increased when the laser power density increased. The molten layer could be torn off to form droplets owing to the high evaporating pressure induced by the high power density laser. The heating efficiency of laser induced vapour plume was lower than that of the molten metal. In reflection experiments, only when the incident angle was 88°, the absorption of reflected laser was greater than that of the first incident laser. The concaved surface of molten layer had a great effect to the reflected laser. During multiple reflections, the considerable absorption of laser energy mainly happened in the first two times. The calculated data were closer to the actual conditions when the influence of polarisation variation was avoided. © 2014 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

84900512617	Influence of slide-blown on plasma characterization of laser dressing for bronze-bonded diamond wheel by a fiber laser	The effects of assistant side-blown operating parameters on the behavior of plasma characteristics and plasma geometry were studied with the aid of high-speed camera in laser dressing of bronze-bonded diamond grinding wheel. The results showed that: high pressure argon plasma reduces swelling height, and as the pressure increases, argon blowing side of the plasma effect is more obvious. Plasma emission spectrum was studied on the grinding wheel radial maximum value with the change in argon gas pressure through the acquisition of plasma emission spectroscopy using spectrometer, and according to the Boltzmann slash and Stark broadening method, the maximal values of plasma electron temperature and electron density in the wheel radial were calculated. It was found that the plasma spectral line intensity first increased and then decreased as gas pressure reached the peak at 0.2 MPa, Larger argon pressure can significantly reduce the temperature and density of plasmas. With optical 3D scanner the wheel surface topography before and after adding side-blown gas was compared. The results indicated that: the topography of grinding wheel with 0.5 MPa side-blown argon is better than that without adding side-blown gas.

84901328879	Plasma inside and outside keyhole during 10 kW level fiber laser welding	In order to understand in depth plasma behavior during ultra-high power fiber laser deep penetration welding, the plasma inside and outside the keyhole is observed, and the spectrum of fiber laser-induced plasma is measured and analyzed. Based on the measured data of plasma, the electron temperature and electron density, ionization degree and pressure are calculated, and the characteristics of plasma parameters at different values of keyhole depth and outside the keyhole are investigated. The results indicate that the distribution of plasma inside the keyhole is uneven, and the vapor plume is much bigger outside the keyhole. The spectrum of plasma show that the fiber laser-induced plasma is weakly ionized and radiates a few spectral lines. The further calculation results also confirm that the plasma induced by fiber laser is in a weakly ionized state. However, the electron density of plasma still stays in a high level, and the transient pressure of plasma is up to hundreds of times as large as atmospheric pressure. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society.

84901932359	Using a car body in white (BIW) to study the feasibility of applying laser welding	Laser welding has been widely used in the automotive industries nowadays due to its high processing speed, good weld bead profile, narrow weld, small heat affected zone (HAZ) and easiness to automate. It brings many more changes in the design of car body in white (BIW) than resistance spot welding. This paper presents an experimental study of the design for car BIW using laser welding. The implementation issues of the laser welding process, including tool collision, joint configuration, and fixturing were discussed. Reasonable ways for adjustment of the design were addressed. A new concept integrated fixture that can be used for both laser cutting and laser welding was proposed to increase the assembly accuracy, improve the weld quality and reduce the assembly time. Moreover, the use of the tailor-welded blanks was discussed and the experimental results showed that the tailor-welded blanks could be successfully applied on the car BIW. © 2014 Old City Publishing, Inc.

84902818448	Laser lap welding of steel and aluminum alloy with Cu, Pb metal sandwich addition	The laser lap welding experiment with Cu, Pb metal sandwich addition was carried out based on the DC56D+ZF galvanized steel of 1.2 mm thickness and the 6016 aluminum alloy of 1.15 mm thickness. Using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and tensile test, the forming of welding, microstructure, element distribution, fracture morphology and the main phase of the welded joint region and mechanical properties of joints were studied. The results show that when Cu and Pb sandwich is added in steel/aluminum, the average tensile strength and elongation of the steel/aluminum laser welding joints is 49.44 MPa and 1.63% as well as 73.51 MPa and 2.37%, respectively. Compared with that without Cu or Pb sandwich addition, the strength and elongation are improved, and Pb is considered as the best metal sandwich based on improved mechanical properties of joints. Steel and aluminum joint specimen fracture shows a brittle fracture characteristic without metal sandwich, the brittle characteristic is not obvious with Cu metal sandwich, while the ductile characteristic is found with Pb sandwich. When Pb sandwich is added, Fe, Al, Zn, Mg and Pb elements change a lot and the mixing zone width is larger in the transition region of steel/aluminum joints. In addition, a new Mg

84903489578	Status and prospect of laser truing and dressing technique for superabrasive grinding wheels	The fundamentals and characteristics of pulsed laser truing and dressing technique were illustrated, and the related research process was reviewed and commented from such aspects as optimization of technical parameters and numerical simulation of laser truing and dressing technique for superabrasive grinding wheels. The major problems in the laser truing and dressing technique were pointed out and the development trend was predicted and prospected. Although progress was made and lots of experiences were accumulated in terms of laser truing and dressing technique for superabrasive grinding wheels so far, crucial subjects such as the fundamental science theory, the evaluation system of grinding wheels surface and the precise in-process truing and dressing technique are still very troublesome in this field.

84903274786	Experimental investigations of machining characteristics of laser-induced thermal cracking in alumina ceramic wet grinding	In order to enhance the grinding precision of alumina ceramic, this paper presents the results of an experimental study of a two-step laser-assisted wet grinding process including laser-induced thermal cracking and wet grinding. In particular, the differences in grinding force, grinding force ratio, and surface finish obtained under laser-assisted wet grinding (LAWG) and conventional grinding (CG) conditions are compared and discussed. It is found that the normal and tangential grinding forces for LAWG condition are lower than for CG condition. The higher material removal rates on LAWG condition can be achieved. The average grinding force ratios for CG condition are lower than for LAWG condition. The surface roughness values are considerable in both conditions, and the improvement for surface roughness is not obvious. This is attributed to the final grinding pass through the unaffected parent material. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

The mechanisms for the pulsed laser tangential profiling and radial sharpening of grinding wheels were theoretically analyzed, and the four key processing parameters that determine the quality, accuracy, and efficiency of pulsed laser dressing, namely, the laser power density, laser spot overlap ratio, laser scanning track line overlap ratio, and number of laser scanning cycles, were proposed. Further, by utilizing cylindrical bronze wheels (without diamond grains) and bronze-bonded diamond grinding wheels as the experimental subjects, the effects of these four processing parameters on the removal efficiency and the surface smoothness of the bond material after pulsed laser ablation, as well as the effects on the contour accuracy of the grinding wheels, the protrusion height of the diamond grains, the sharpness of the grain cutting edges, and the graphitization degree of the diamond grains after pulsed laser dressing, were explored.

84906686349	Study on surface undercut of laser welding of thick plate with 10 kW class fiber laser	Due to surface undercut in the process of welding of SUS 304 stainless steel plate with 12 mm thickness using high power fiber laser, the flow of molten pool was captured by a high-speed camera based on “sandwich” method. The influences of the welding orientations, welding speed and the root hump on the surface undercut were discussed, and the formation causes of the surface undercut were investigated. The results show that the average depth decreases gradually with varying the welding orientations from horizontal orientation welding to the vertical orientation welding. Moreover, as the welding speed becoming smaller, the size of the “shelf” on the keyhole front wall increases and the undercut becomes deeper. With generation of the root hump, the top molten pool lacks the liquid metal resulting in surface undercut.

84906257133	Delay-dependent passive analysis and control for interval stochastic time-delay systems	This paper is concerned with the problem of delay-dependent passive analysis and control for interval stochastic time-delay systems. The system matrices are assumed to be uncertain within given intervals, the time delay is a time-varying continuous function belonging to a given range, and the stochastic perturbation is in the form of a Brownian motion. By using It Ǒ's differential formula and the Lyapunov stability theory, delaydependent stochastic passive control criteria are proposed without ignoring any useful terms by considering the information of the lower bound and upper bound for the time delay. Based on the criteria obtained, a delay-dependent passive controller that ensures the stochastic passivity of the closed-loop system is presented. Then, the controller gain is characterized in terms of LMIs, which can be easily checked by resorting to available software packages. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. © 2014 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

84908029341	Experimental study of machining characteristics in laser induced wet grinding silicon nitride	Silicon nitride ceramics are extremely difficult and time-consuming to machine with conventional methods, such as turning and grinding. Laser-assisted machining has been a field of extensive research during the past decade, as it is a promising solution to enhance the machinability of many difficult-to-cut materials, including silicon nitride ceramics. To enhance the processing precision of silicon nitride ceramic grinding, this paper presents an experimental investigation of a two-stage laser-induced wet grinding (LIWG) process, including laser-induced thermal cracking and wet grinding. Specifically, the differences in the grinding force, grinding force ratio and surface roughness obtained for LIWG and conventional grinding (CG) conditions are compared and discussed. The normal and tangential grinding forces for LIWG condition were lower than for the CG condition with a maximum reduction of 70.4% (83.3%) for the maximum average normal (tangential) grinding forces. The values of the force ratio for the CG condition and LIWG condition were in the range of 3.7-5.5 and 6.5-11.5. Little improvement was achieved, and the surface roughness values are considerable for both conditions.
