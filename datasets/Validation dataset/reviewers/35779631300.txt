33644612591	Progress in researches of phononic crystal and the application perspectives	Phononic crystals are conception and acoustic materials appeared ten years ago. This kind of periodical structure can be considered as having the function of filtration, i.e., the crystal breaks into pass-bands and band-gaps due to Prague scatter when vibration or sound with multiple frequencies is transmitted through it. Propagation of vibration and sound in the band-gap is not allowed. On the contrary, other frequency components can pass the crystal freely. Positions of band-gaps and pass-bands can be engineered by evaluating the acoustic wave equations in the crystals. In addition, existence of the band-gaps is closely associated with the Anderson localization of phonons in inhomogeneous media. The concepts, basic features, development, theoretical methods, and potential applications are discussed.

33750402650	Research on FTU of the railway power supply line	Aiming at the status of 10 kV power through feeder line (automatic blocking line) along the railway and comparing the through feeder line with the general electric power feeder, this paper designs a new type of FTU utilized to sectionalizing switch. FTU's key hardwares are 80C196KC20 and the hardware extends 8kROM, 32kROM, 2kE2PROM24LC16B, two pieces of MAX125, real time clock DS12887, read and write control logic equipment EPM7128SQC100Q, LCD controller 6963c. The software accurately collects three phases and zero sequence current of line where FTU is installed and then deals with these data. Moreover, it also sends all kinds of currents real part and imagine part to STU(Substation terminal unit). Laboratory simulations testify that if FTU connects with STU to form a net, it can reliably locates and isolates single phase grounding fault when zero sequence current is higher than 0.1A, and that when short circuit fault between phases occurs, FTU will send disconnection signal which is set by time and current in advance. So it can be realized that non-fault section doesn't power cut and the fault section is isolated. At the same time, our FTU has strong expansibility, it can be applied to power system of distribution automation system if it changes a little.

33846527991	Strength analysis of steam turbine blade based on the stochastic finite element method	There are many stochastic parameters to have effect on the strength of steam turbine blade in practical operation. In order to improve the reliability of blade design, these stochastic parameters are necessary to be taken into account. Although the deterministic finite element method can be used to obtain good results, it does not consider the uncertainty factors. So it has significant engineering application to combine the stochastic analysis approach with deterministic finite element method, that leads to the concept of the stochastic finite element method (SFEM), and it can be used to analyze the reliability of the blade. In this paper, a twisted blade in low-pressure stages of steam turbine is chosen to be investigated. A rotating vary cross-section twisted beam is created to be as its mechanical model. The stiffness matrix and the load matrix of the blade are obtained by using the method of strain energy principle under synergic effect of the axial deformation, the bend deformation and the shear deformation. The Young's modulus is considered as random field and discretized by the local averaging method. The program of the two-order perturbation stochastic finite element method (PSFEM) is developed to calculate the statistical characteristics of the stresses of the blade under Young's modulus, steam force and rotate speed with randomness. The results of PSFEM is verified to be valid by comparing with the Monte-Carlo method.

33947525585	Boiler drum life real-time monitoring based on a rain-flow counting method	A model for monitoring the temperature and stress profiles of boiler drums has been established. Based on the start-up data of a boiler drum acquired from the DCS (distributed control system) of a power plant, the hazardous point on the boiler-drum can be determined from a finite element analysis and the stress concentration factor at that point also corrected. An implicit difference method to calculate the transient temperature profile of the boiler drum and the equivalent stress calculation formula of the hazardous point were given, thereby improving the rain-flow counting method. Proposed is a criterion for judging the completion of boiler drum startup and shutdown process by adopting a stress stabilization principle. The number of different stress amplitude cycles at each startup and shutdown process was added up and on this basis the life wastage of the boiler drum determined. By analyzing the data acquired from a cold startup of the boiler drum, the authors have verified the effectiveness of the method under discussion and thereby developed a real-time system for monitoring the service life of boiler drums. The boiler drum monitoring operation of a 600 MW turbo-generator boiler drum shows the effectiveness of the method in achieving the aim of performing a real-time monitoring of boiler drum life wastage and of providing guidance for their operation.

34248187960	Probability strength design of steam turbine blade and sensitivity analysis with respect to random parameters based on response surface method	There are many stochastic parameters to have effect on the reliability of steam turbine blade in practical operation. In order to improve the reliability of blade design, these stochastic parameters are necessary to be taken into account. In this paper, an equal cross-section blade is investigated and a finite element model is built parametrically. Geometrical parameters, material parameters and load parameters of blade are considered as input random variables while the maximum deflection and maximum equivalent stress are output random variables. Analysis file of blade is compiled by determined finite element method and applied to be loop file to create sample points. A quadratic polynomial with cross terms is chosen to regress these samples by step-forward regression method and employed as a surrogate of numerical solver to drastically reduce the number of solvers call. Then Monte-Carlo method is used to obtain the statistical characteristics and cumulative distribution function of maximum deflection and maximum equivalent stress of the blade. Probability sensitivities analysis, which combines the slope of the gradient and the width of the scatter range of the random input variables, is applied to evaluate how much the output parameters are influenced by the random input parameters. Scatter plots of structural responses with respect to the random input variables are illustrated to analyze how to change the input random variables to improve the reliability of blade. The results show that combination of finite element method, response surface method and Monte-Carlo method is an ideal method for the reliability analysis and probability strength design of blade.

34547968708	Probability design of static frequency and dynamic frequency for steam turbine blade and sensitivity analysis based on the response surface method	There are many stochastic parameters to have effect on the inherent vibration of steam turbine blade. The probability analysis and design for the inherent vibration is the foundation of the dynamic strength reliability design of the blade. An equal cross-section blade was investigated and a finite element model was built parametrically. Geometrical parameters (such as length, width and thickness), material parameters (such as young's modulus and density) and speed of blade were considered as input random variables while the static frequencies and dynamic frequencies were output random variables. Combining the finite element method (FEM), response surface method (RSM) and Monte Carlo method, the statistical properties and cumulative distribution functions of static frequencies and dynamic frequencies were obtained. Probability sensitivities analysis, which combined the slope of the gradient and the width of the scatter range of the random input variables, was applied to quantitatively evaluate the sensitivities of static frequencies and dynamic frequencies with respect to the random variables. The Scatter plots of structural responses with respect to the random input variables were illustrated how to adjust the values of the static frequencies and dynamic frequencies by changing input random variables. The results demonstrate that the FEM-RSM-Monte Carlo method is an optional approach for the dynamic strength reliability design of the blade as it has less and fast calculations and high regression precision accuracy.

36048983427	Resonance reliability assessment of turbine blade with parametric	Stochastic finite element method and reliability technique are used to determine the safety degree of the turbine blade with parametric uncertainty. The material, geometric parameters and rotating speed of blade exhibit notable random fluctuations, so the conventional deterministic analysis of blade can't provide complete information. The stochastic analysis can tackle the uncertainties in structural parameters and obtain the probabilistic characteristic of the vibration characteristic. In this paper, the study focuses on the reliability assessment of the blade with uncertainty parameters based on the stochastic finite element method (SFEM) and the mean-variance method. The perturbation stochastic finite element method (PSFEM) is used to calculate probabilistic characteristic of the natural vibration of the turbine blade. Based on the stochastic finite element method, the mean-variance method is used to calculate the resonance reliability of the blade. The example shows that the present method is valid.

38049068116	Probability analysis of static frequency and dynamic frequency of steam turbine blade based on RBF neural network and Monte Carlo simulation	Dynamic stress of steam turbine blade has great influence on its reliability and fatigue life. In order to decrease the magnitude of dynamic stress, frequency modulation method is often used to avoid resonance, which implies the frequency of active force must be kept away from the inherent vibration frequency of blade. At present, many models of calculating inherent vibration frequency of blade are deterministic, which didn't consider the randomness of many parameters (such as loading parameters, geometric parameters, material parameters) in practical operation. So, in this paper, an equal cross-section blade is investigated and a finite element model is built parametrically. Geometrical parameters (such as length, width and thickness), material parameters (such as young's modulus and density) and rotation speed of blade are treated as input random variables while the static frequencies and dynamic frequencies are treated as output random variables. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is adopted to model and approximate the implicit function between the inherent frequencies and input random variables. The RBF technique uses a small set of the actual data which are obtained from calling the finite element solver several times and are used to develop a trained RBF algorithm. Then a large number of function values can be obtained from the established and successfully trained RBF network and are applied by Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the statistical characteristics and cumulative distribution functions of static frequencies and dynamic frequencies of the blade. The results demonstrate that the FEM-RBF-Monte Carlo method is an optional approach for the dynamic strength reliability design of the blade as RBF network has high regression precision and rapid calculation. © 2007 IEEE.

Combined with examples, a comparison has been made to the static response respectively obtained by analytical method and improved iterative algorithm. Results show that the improved iterative algorithm can satisfy the requirement of actual engineering projects, which may help to quantitatively determine the reliability of blade.

43249099335	Effect of trimethylamine on the formation of anatase titania nanoparticles by gel-sol method	The anatase titania particles with controlled size and shape were prepared in large amount in the presence of trimethylamine (TMA) from the hydrolysis of a Ti-triethanolamine (TEOA) complex by gel-sol method. In the absence of TMA, ellipsoidal particles were obtained due to the anisotropic growth caused by the specific adsorption of TEOA onto the crystal planes parallel to the c-axis of a titania particle. TMA acted as a complexing agent of Ti(IV) ion to promote the growth of ellipsoidal particles and then inhibited the anisotropic crystal growth to produce ellipsoids of a low aspect ratio, rather than a shape controller to produce ellipsoids with a high aspect ratio. This may be explained in terms of the weak complexing between TMA (a tertiary amine) and Ti(IV) ion. The particle size was also controlled by seeding of anatase titania. Moreover, the seeding suggested that the rate-determining step of the gel-sol process was not the dissolution of the hydroxide gel, but the deposition of the monomeric precursor from the solution phase. Some cationic surfactants also promoted the particle grown to produce particles with a high symmetry in a similar way to TMA. © 2008 MAIK Nauka.

49649085758	Electric energy measurement based on the effective absorbed power under non-sinusoidal conditions	Along with the rapid development of power electronic technology, the application of non-liner load becomes more and more with the capacity becomes larger and larger. Massive harmonics are poured into the power grid, leading to the distortion of the system voltage and current. Meanwhile, the non-liner loads usually own complex characteristics such as power inrushing, three phase imbalance, harmonics, inter-harmonics, and so on, which directly affect the correctness and validity of energy measuring. Therefore, the energy metering instrument which designs based on the sine power theory or the traditional non-sinusoidal power theory can not reflect the real energy that the loads absorb form the system. The correct definition and measurement of power under distortion condition become a matter of common concern both to the power supply system and the customers. In this paper, IEEE Std. 1459-2000 is studied and a novel energy measuring method based on the effective absorbed power is put forward. Beginning with the analysis of energy transmission and the line-loss, the total energy of the system is quantified. The shortcomings of the traditional power theory and the corresponding algorithm in analyzing the energy measurement are studied comprehensively. In view of the background harmonic, the energy measuring methods are studied from the line-loss and effective absorbed power. The analysis results indicate that the method proposed in this paper can correctly reflect the power consumption of the surge loads and the exchange energy. © 2008 DRPT.

51749091545	Considerations on the coordinated control of controllable reactors	In the extra-high voltage long transmission line, the non-allowed increasing of power voltage and the corresponding transient oscillation over-voltage are often occurred. The continued burning of the secondary arc usually keeps quite a long time for the high voltage level, long line and large capacity. There must lead to the failure of the re-closing if the secondary arc is not extinguished promptly, which will affect the security and stability of the system. In this paper, the dynamic induced over-voltage model as well as the dynamic secondary arc model in single-phase asymmetric breaking is established based on the distribution parameters of EHV long-line. A novel kind of high-controlled shunt reactor with a small reactor in the neutral is adopted to suppress the transient oscillation over-voltage and the secondary arc. Since the neutral point small reactor is constrained by the positive-sequence and zero-sequence capacitance of the line and the shunt reactor as well. The coordinate control of the neutral controllable small reactor achieves the dynamic change in accordance with the high-controlled shunt reactor which can realize the compensation of the phase capacitor so as to suppress the induced over-voltage and the secondary arc effectively. ©2008 IEEE.

With the straight blades of a steam turbine in a test rig serving as an object of study, the randomness of geometrical parameters (including length, width, thickness), material parameters (elastic modulus, density) and rotating speed was taken into consideration. On this basis, a statistical learning theory was applied to obtain the statistical parameters and accumulative distribution function of static (dynamic) frequencies of blades by an integration of the deterministic finite element and radial basis function (RBF) with Monte Carlo simulation method. By adopting a probabilistic sensitivity analytic method, the authors have made a quantitative assessment of the sensitivity of blade static and dynamic frequencies to random input variables. The analytic results can provide positive guidelines for general engineering practice. Furthermore, the authors have compared the calculation results with those obtained by a response surface method, and concluded that the analytic method in question offers a quicker approach than the response surface method. It can serve as an alternative method for the dynamic strength reliability analysis of blades.

In the light of the blade function being a random variable implicit function, a reliability reverse-solution-seeking design method was presented based on finite element method, BP neural network and decomposition techniques. It combined the finite element method with BP neural network to establish an approximate analytic expression showing the relationship between the performance function and the random input variables . By employing the decomposition techniques, the overall optimization problem involving the solution-seeking of random design parameters was decomposed into a main problem and sub-problems. By way of the sub-problems, the standard optimization toolbox was used directly to obtain the reliability indexes, and the decomposition and iterative techniques were employed to seek solutions to the main problem, thus obtaining the sensitivity of the random design parameters and target reliability indexes to various random variables. With the equal and straight blades of a steam turbine on a test rig serving as an example, the concrete application process of the method was expounded. The method features a simple mathematical expression and can be direcdy used in standard optimization programs. It successfully solved the reliability reverse-solution-seeking design problem of blades under an implicit function, thus enjoying a relatively good application value for engineering projects.

At present, many models of calculating inherent vibration frequency of blade are deterministic, which didn't consider the randomness of many parameters (such as loading parameters, geometric parameters, material parameters) in practical operation. In this paper, a variable-section torsion blade is investigated and a new approach which is the combination of finite element method (FEM), artificial neural network (ANN) and Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) is put forward to solve the vibration reliability analysis of blade.

78650495075	Numerical and experimental study of joint slippage in a lattice transmission tower	Transmission towers are vital components of overhead transmission lines, which play an important role in the operation of electrical power systems. At the design stage, accurate prediction of tower response under a variety of design loads is very important for the structural reliability and safety of the transmission system. Accuracy in the re-analysis of existing tower designs is also essential to yield a realistic assessment of the tower capacity. Several studies have pointed out the influence of bolted connections traditionally used in steel lattice towers to explain deviations between realistic tower displacement response and numerical model predictions. Connection effects can be of two main sources: 1) connection eccentricities introduced in detailing, and 2) bolt slippage in joints. The present study concentrates on bolt slippage effects. Classical steel lattice transmission towers typically comprise bearing-type bolted joints with relatively low clamping force connecting galvanized faying surfaces which have a low coefficient of friction; such joints are prone to slippage and it is well known that conventional structural analysis based on idealized joint behaviour cannot predict the tower deformation precisely. In this paper, several numerical models of a single-circuit 110 kV lattice steel tower of Chinese design are created to investigate the effects of joint slippage on tower displacements and stresses. Experimental results from full-scale prototype tests are used in the comparison and show that the real deformation of the tower can be twice as large as that obtained from numerical models without joint slippage. The study compares various joint slippage models available in the literature and implements them in numerical simulations.

Accurate prediction of the structural capacity of lattice towers under different failure modes is very important for accurate assessment of the reliability of transmission lines and power grids, and for design of efficient failure containment measures. Traditionally, lattice towers are analyzed as ideal trusses or frame-truss systems without explicitly considering loading eccentricities and slippage effects in bolted joints. Such effects are always observed in full-scale tower tests and introduce great differences in the ultimate bearing capacity and failure modes obtained from classical linear analysis models. In this paper experimental results available from full-scale prototype tests of a single-circuit 110 kV and a single-circuit 220 kV lattice transmission towers subjected to different load cases are presented and compared with those obtained from four series of numerical models that include joint eccentricity effects and different joint slippage models. The numerical simulation results confirm that joint slippage dramatically increases the deformation of the lattice towers, while its influence on load-bearing capacity will vary in different load cases according to the magnitude of vertical loading and the tower failure mode. Results from the pushover nonlinear static analysis of the towers considering both joint slippage and eccentricity are found in agreement with the experimental results. This type of analysis can be used to model joint effects in lattice towers. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

80054982182	Probabilistic design optimization of frequency dispersion for rotating blades	In this paper, a probabilistic design optimization method based on finite element method is proposed to calculate the variability of design parameters subject to a specified dispersion of natural frequencies of rotating blades. The element stiffness and mass matrices are derived using a two-stage finite element method and numerical integration. Based on the perturbation technology, the sensitivity of the frequencies, as well as relationship between the frequency dispersion and the coefficient of variability (CV) of the design parameters can be obtained. Such sensitivity information is then used to convert the probabilistic design optimization problem into a deterministic optimization problem. Two case studies are given to illustrate the proposed method. From the results, it is concluded that rotation of blade changes the sensitivity of CV to the design parameters considered, and using the proposed method can transform the probabilistic constraints to deterministic constraints. © 2010 by ASME.

To meet with the requirement of blade high reliability operation, it is necessary to take these stochastic parameters into account, determine the statistical characteristics of inherent vibration frequencies, create the performance function to avoid the resonance and further carry out the vibration reliability analysis. A variable cross-section torsion blade is investigated and geometrical parameters, material parameters, installation parameters and rotation speed are considered as random variables, a method which is the combination of finite element method (FEM), response surface method (RSM) and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is put forward to solve the blade vibration reliability analysis. Based on the finite element parametrical model of torsion blade and experiment design, the two kinds of response surface methods, multinomial response surface method (MRSM) and artificial neural network (ANN), are respectively applied to construct the approximation analytic expressions between the blade responses (including static frequencies and dynamic frequencies) and input random variables, which act as a surrogate of finite element solver to drastically reduce the number of solvers call. Then the surrogate is used for most of the samples needed in Monte Carlo method and the statistical parameters and cumulative distribution functions of the static frequencies and dynamic frequencies are obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. Aiming at the dangerous modes of vibration, the performance functions to avoid resonance are determined and the vibration reliability analysis is achieved.

Finally, the sensitivity between fluctuation of the design parameters and structural response was analyzed by the interval sensitive factors that were defined.

0037966273	New method of locating and isolation for single phase grounding fault section of feeders in power distribution network based on new types of distribution automation switchgear	To solve the problem of locating and isolating single phase grounding fault section of feeders in power distribution networks, single phase grounding faults in ineffectively grounded systems are analyzed, the results indicate the zero sequence current draining into the fault section (the vector sum of zero sequence current draining into the section from its knots) nearly equal to the zero sequence current draining into the fault spot while the zero sequence current draining into the sound section equal to capacitive current of this section. According to the analysis, a new method of locating single phase grounding fault sections is proposed. In this method the fault section of a feeder is located by inspecting the ratio of the maxim amplitude value of the zero sequence current draining into the every section of the feeder to the average amplitude value of that draining in the other sections and the phase difference between the maxim zero sequence current draining into every section of the feeder and the zero sequence voltage. If the qualification is fulfilled, the feeder is the fault feeder and the section corresponding to the maxim zero sequence current is the fault section. Results of simulations testify that the method is applicable in all types of ineffectively grounding systems and is independent of transition reactance.

The guy cable's pre-stress is crucial to tower's mechanical properties. The nonlinearity finite element model of the single mast guyed tower in UHV DC transmission lines was built. Mechanical characters of the guy were analyzed, and the concept of critical pre-stress was presented. The influence of the guy cable's pre-stress on the guyed tower's mechanical properties was studied. The result shows that: when the initial guy cable's pre-stress is less than critical stress, the nodes' displacement decreases with the growth of initial guy cable pre-stress, while the guy cables' work stress, tower's support force and leg member's axial force are almost kept unchanged. However, when the initial guy cable's pre-stress is greater than the critical guy cable's pre-stress, the nodes' displacement is nearly kept the same, and with the growth of the initial guy cable's pre-stress, the guy cables' work stress, tower's support force and leg member's axial force have a linear increase. The critical stress is about half of the windward guy cable's work stress, and in the actual projects the initial guy cable's pre-stress should be less than the critical guy cable's pre-stress. © 2014 Chin.
