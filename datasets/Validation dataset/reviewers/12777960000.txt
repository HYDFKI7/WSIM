84929380223	An electrode modified with AuNPs/graphene nanocomposites film for the determination of methyl parathion residues	A novel sensitive and elective electrochemical sensor was developed to detect methyl parathion (MP) based on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)/graphene nanocomposites film. The AuNPs were modified onto graphene sheets using NaBH<inf>4</inf> as a reductant. The obtained AuNPs/graphene nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical behavior of MP and interference studies were then investigated. Compared with metal ions and nitroaromatic compounds, which exist in environmental samples, the AuNPs/graphene/GCE exhibited high adsorption and strong affinity toward MP. Under optimized conditions, the oxidation peak current of MP was linear to its concentration within the range of 4.0 × 10<sup>-7</sup>-8.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup> M, with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 8.5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M. These results indicated that the AuNPs/graphene nanocomposites displayed a synergic effect involving the catalytic characteristics of graphene and AuNPs nanocomposites, which can effectively improve the electrochemical properties of MP. Furthermore, the AuNPs also enhanced sensor sensitivity to MP. Therefore, the AuNPs/graphene/GCE could be a promising sensor for the fast, sensitive and selective detection of MP in real samples.

84908584053	Development of a colorimetric sensor array for the discrimination of chinese liquors based on selected volatile markers determined by GC-MS	A new colorimetric sensor array was developed for the discrimination of 12 high-alcoholic Chinese base liquors from Luzhou Co., Ltd., and 15 commercial Chinese liquor of different brands as well as flavor types. Seventeen volatile compounds within four chemical groups were determined as markers in the base liquor by GC-MS analysis and factor analysis method (FAM). A specialized colorimetric sensor array composed of 20 sensitive dots was fabricated accordingly to obtain sensitive interaction with different types of volatile markers. Discrimination of the liquor samples was subsequently performed using chemometric and statistical methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). The results suggested that facile identification of either base liquors with high-alcoholic volume or commercial liquors of the same flavor types could be achieved by analysis of the color change profiles. The response of the sensor improved significantly in comparison with those that rely on nonspecific interactions, and no misclassification was observed for both liquor samples using two chemometric methods. Besides, it was also found that the discrimination is closely related to the characteristic flavor compounds (esters, aldehydes, and acids) and alcoholic strength in liquors, and its performance was even comparable with that of GC-MS.

50949111151	Spectrophotometric detection of dimethyl methyl-phosphonate using plant-esterase	We have developed an optical detection method for dimethyl methyl-phosphonate (DMMP) based on reversible inhibition of plant-esterase by monosulfonate tetraphenyl porphyrin (TPPS<inf>1</inf>). The abosorbance spectrum of the porphyrin-enzyme complex solution is measured with a LAMBDA 500 spectrophotometer. The characteristics of the abosorbance spectrum of TPPS <inf>1</inf> are specific and different when the porphyrin is bound to the enzyme. Addition of ?-naphthyl acetate or DMMP displaces the porphyrin from the enzyme resulting in reduced absorbance intensity at 420 nm. Absorbance changes at 420 nm show linear dependence on DMMP concentration. DMMP concentrations as low as 9×10<sup>-11</sup> mol L<sup>-1</sup> have been detected. This optically-based approach promised much simpler and more sensitive detection capabilities. © 2008 IEEE.

52949152809	Study of high-throughput cell electrofusion in a microelectrode-array chip	A microfabricated high-throughput cell electrofusion chip with 1,368 pairs of high aspect ratio silicon microelectrodes is presented. These microelectrodes, which were distributed in six individual microscale cell-fusion chambers, were covered with titanium and gold thin film to improve their electric conductivity as well as surface hydrophobility. Six chambers having different electrode distances make the chip highly suitable for fusing cells with different sizes. A microfluidic platform was set up for flowing control, cell manipulation and also experimental observation. Cells for electrofusion were first aligned at the prearranged locations by the dielectrophoretic force between two counter-electrodes, which benefits the traverse of electric pulse through the cell-cell contacting point for electroporation. Several on-chip cell electrofusion experiments have been carried out on different kinds of animal cells and plant protoplasts. Compared with conventional electrofusion methods, higher fusion efficiency was achieved on this device for precisely forming micropores on the proximate membranes of two contacting cells, and high throughput was also obtained due to the use of a large number of microelectrodes for cell manipulation and fusion. Moreover, a much lower power supply was required for the shorter distance between two counter-electrodes. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

Using a cross-responsive array containing a diverse family of chemically responsive dyes, the colorimetric sensor array provides enormous discriminatory power among different analytes. Digital imaging of the dye array before and after immersion provides a color change profile as a unique fingerprint for each specific analyte. The 6×6 array used in this research has 36 dyes that were sensitive to amino acids. A functional portable type apparatus was developed for data acquisition and data processing.

The initial polymerization was carried out at 18°C with different duration, followed by freezing polymerization at -18°C for 24h. The results showed that the immediate performance of freezing polymerization played a dominant role in the final properties of the P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) hydrogels. The thermoresponsive rate and mechanical strength of the hydrogels were drastically changed by freezing the reaction mixture after 3min of the first polymerization (PNA-3). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies revealed that the hydrogel frozen after 3 min exhibited the most highly interconnected porous structures and the largest pore size. These open pore structures were very useful to accelerate the responsive rate of the hydrogels. In vitro BSA (bovine serum albumin) release from the hydrogel PNA-3 exhibited relatively small initial burst release followed by a steady release. Such results demonstrated that the P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) hydrogels frozen before gelation have the potential to be applicated for delivering proteins.Macroporous poly(N-isopropylamide-co-acrylamide) hydrogels with a very fast thermoresponsive rate were successfully prepared by a two-step polymerization method.

Distribution of PLGA microspheres in the hydrogel was determined by SEM, and the in vitro protein release characteristics of combination system were investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. The SEM results showed that PLGA microspheres were encased into the interconnected porous structure of PNIPAAm hydrogel. In vitro release of BSA from combination system exhibited a less burst release followed by a slower sustained release for 20 days. The slow release after the initial burst release was due to the low permeability of BSA in PLGA microspheres. The controlled release of BSA encapsulated within microspheres embedded in scaffolds was better controlled when compared to delivery from PNIPAAm hydrogels alone. The combination systems showed great promise for application in protein delivery.

The internal pore structure and surface morphology of hydrogels were observed by surface area analyzer and scanning electron microscope. The equilibrium swelling ratio and the swelling/deswelling kinetics of the hydrogels were investigated. The influence of reaction time of the pre-freezing polymerization on the thermo-responsive rate of the hydrogels was also studied. The results showed that the interconnecting porous network structure had been successfully prepared by the freezing polymerization method. These open pore structures are very useful to accelerate the responsive rate of the hydrogel. The results of swelling properties show that the time of pre-freezing polymerization play a dominant role in the final properties of P(NIPAAm-co-AAm) hydrogel. The equilibrium swelling ratio(SR) of hydrogels reduced with reaction time of pre-freezing polymerization increasing. The lowest critical phase transition temperature(LCST) of P(NIPAm-co-AAm) hydrogels were all around 35°C, and different reaction time of pre-freezing polymerization have little effect on it. The swelling/deswelling rate decreased with the reaction time of the pre-polymerization polymerization increasing.

Feasibility of the polymers to be used for actual application was also evaluated with spiked samples, indicating great potential for large-scale applications. Moreover, the streptomycin-imprinted polymers can be repeatedly used for 12 cycles without losing original performance, which is beneficial for commercial use. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84878258502	Role of tryptophan in the active site of plant esterase: Chemical modification and fluorometric studies	Plant esterase extracted from wheat flour play key roles in the spectrophotometric detection of organophosphorus compounds (OPs) for food safety and human health. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of tryptophan residues in the activity and structure of plant esterase by chemical modification and fluorometric studies. Active site characterization of purified plant esterase showed the involvement of tryptophan in the catalytic activity. Only one was essential for the enzyme activity by the Tsou's analysis. Substrate protection experiments further confirmed that the tryptophan residue was located at the substrate-binding site. Fluorescence quenching studies elucidated that the tryptophan residues were largely exposed to the solvent, and a smaller fraction of the surface tryptophan residues had electropositively charged amino acids around them. Experimental results obtained here are expected to promote the applications of plant esterase in OPs detection. Further confirmation of the existence of other critical residues and detailed explanation of their functions were also required for the elucidation of the mechanism involved in the detection of OPs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84878914825	Synthesis and properties of molecularly imprinted polymeric microspheres of metalloporphyrins with dimethyl methylphosphonate as template molecule	Moleculary imprinted polymeric microspheres (MIPMs) based on 5-(4-methyl acryloyl oxygen phenyl)-10, 15, 20-triphenyl zinc porphyrin (ZnMOTPP) and 5-(4-methyl acryloyl oxygen phenyl)-10, 15, 20-triphenyl gadolinium porphyrin (GdMOTPP) were prepared with dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) as template and methacrylic acid (MAA) as auxiliary function monomer, including MIPMs-Zn+MAA, MIPMs-Gd+MAA and MIPMs-MAA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the average particle size was between 50-100 μm and the particle size was uniform. Comparative study of adsorption and specificity showed that the adsorption capacity of MIPMs-Zn+MAA was superior to that of MIPMs-Gd+MAA. The adsorption capacities of MIPMs-Zn+MAA and MIPMs-Gd+MAA were much greater than that of MIPMs-MAA. MIPMs also showed better selectivity for DMMP through the isotherm binding test of diomethoate and phorate. By Scatchard analysis, the data of equilibrium adsorption experiment displayed that the MIPMs-DMMP only had one affinity binding site. The maximum absorption quantities of MIPMs-Zn+MAA, MIPMs-Gd+MAA and MIPMs-MAA were 148, 78.9 and 13.57 μmol/g, respectively.

84881009314	New method for identifying the aromatic types of chinese liquors based on a 96-well plate	A cross-response liquid array sensor that simulated the mammalian taste system was developed for the determination of liquor aromatic types. The liquid array sensor was constructed with 8 sensing units which were consisted of 7 chemical dyes and 1 porphyrin compound. It achieved the type identification through the analyte fingerprints constituted by congregating the spectral response signal of 8 sensing units. The data were collected via a 96-well plate microplate reader, and then was further analyzed with principal component analysis(PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis(HCA) and linear discriminant analysis(LDA). We detected 9 different aromatic liquors. PCA results suggested that the mechanism of identification was mainly based on the trace components of Chinese liquor. Thereamong, the acids of Chinese liquor were the maximum contribution for the identification, because the contribution rate of acids was 54.3% and that of aromatic substances was only 18.6%. Simultaneously, only by 63.4% data rate could distinct liquor aromatic types with satisfaction. HCA dendrogram demonstrated that 9 different aromatic liquors could be correctly classified. LDA further showed the classification accuracy of identification for these 9 different aromatic liquors was 100%. These results showed that this method may provide a simple and efficient way for the rapid identification of liquor.

84883314563	Discrimination of Lung Cancer Related Volatile Organic Compounds with a Colorimetric Sensor Array	A simple and rapid discrimination of four lung cancer related volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was achieved with a novel colorimetric sensor array. Based on the cross-responsive mechanism, the sensor system exhibited high sensitivity to selected lung cancer biomarkers, including p-xylene, styrene, isoprene, and hexanal with concentrations varying from 50 ppb to 500 ppb. By extracting color information, it provided good selectivity and fine discrimination of selected gases via pattern recognition with Fisher linear discriminant (FLD). Additionally, with the employment of the Takagi-Sogeno Fuzzy Neural Network (TSFNN), different concentrations of selected VOCs were discriminated. It also suggested that the colorimetric sensor array proposed could not only distinguish different lung cancer related VOCs but also discriminate specific VOCs of different concentrations with an average rate of classification up to 95%. Our preliminary study demonstrated that the cross-responsive sensor array had infinite potential for further clinical and commercial use for early diagnosis of lung cancer. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84883660635	Study on the preparation of streptomycin imprinted polymers on the surface of silica micro and nano spheres	The integration of molecular imprinting technique and solid-phase extraction (SPE) implements an effective alternative for sample pre-concentration in the determination and analysis of veterinary drug/pesticide residues. Herein, we reports a preliminary study on the preparation of streptomycin imprinted polymers on the surface of silica micro-spheres (with an average size of 50μm) and nano-spheres (with an average size of 500nm) via sol gel method. A mixed solution of tetrahydrofuran, ethanol and water (volume ratio is 7:1:1) was choose as dispersion agent, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and phenyltriethoxysilane as functional monomers, and tetraethyl orthosilicate as cross-linker, while ammonia solution served as catalyst in the polymerization process. Scanning electron microscopic characterization was employed, suggesting that activating time exerts important influences on the morphology of activated silica micro-spheres, and also resultant molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs). The absorption capacity and selectivity of the obtained two MIPs were also evaluated for streptomycin and its analogue compounds in water samples. The results illustrate that the streptomycin-imprinted silica micro-spheres (MMIP) exhibited both larger absorption capacity and higher selectivity than those of silica nano-spheres (NMIP). The variant analytical performance might result from inadequate polymerization on the surface of silica nano-spheres. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

84884320228	Discrimination of Chinese green tea according to varieties and grade levels using artificial nose and tongue based on colorimetric sensor arrays	Colorimetric artificial tongue and nose were used to discriminate nine Chinese green teas from different geographical origins and grade levels. Printing nanoporous porphyrin, dimeric metalloporphyrins, metallosalophen complexes and chemically responsive dyes on a hydrophobic membrane, the developed sensor array of artificial tongue and nose showed a unique pattern of colorimetric change upon exposure to green tea liquids or gases. All green tea samples, both in liquid and gas analysis, gave distinct patterns according to geographical origin and grade level, thus resulting in their facile identification. The good reproducibility of colorimetric artificial tongue and nose was proved. Data analysis was performed by chemometric techniques: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA). Chinese green tea from the same geographical origin could cluster together in PCA score plot. No errors in classification by HCA were observed in 90 trials. The colorimetric artificial tongue and nose can be used to discriminate Chinese green tea according to geographical origin and grade level. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84883679084	The rapid fabrication of hydrogel microfluidic chip for cell capture culture and metabolites detection	The microfluidic chip with well-defined structure is an important platform for cell research. The existing techniques for chip fabrication especially in cell biology and tissue engineering have many defects, for example, poor processing precision, high processing cost, as well as sophisticated manufacturing procedure. Thus, fabrication of simple and practicable microfluidic chip with highly efficient cell control ability and low-cost is turned to be the main target for bioengineering application. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is a hydrophilic polymer. Substituting terminal hydroxyl groups with acrylates, forming poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), allows the polymer to be cross-linked to form a three-dimensional polymer network. Meanwhile the use of photopolymerization can realize precise and temporal control of polymerization for formation of complex shapes. Herein, we utilize PEGDA hydrogel's highly tunable characteristic, using photopolymerization method to obtain desirable micro-structure. Each chip has four of uniform micro-structures, which can carry multiple parallel experiments at the same time. We also add 2-Hydroxyethyl Methacrylate (HEMA) to the PEGDA prepolymer in order to increase the cell adhesion capacity of the microchip surface for cell culture. The experimental results showed that this method can achieve double-layer cell culture with short time treatment. Cells can be well captured and cultured in the hydrogel microfluidic chip with excellent activity. The hydrogel microfluidic chip has the potential of practicable application once large-scale preparation is accomplished. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

84883725238	Morphology controlled nanostructure of zinc porphyrin	We have shown that various Zinc porphyrin-based nanostructures can be easily synthesized by a surfactant-assisted self-assembly method, where nonionic, anionic and cationic surfactants are employed. It was found that tuning the type of surfactant offered an alternative to promote the formation of Zinc porphyrin nanostructure with different morphologies in aqueous solutions. As-prepared nano-scale self-assemblies, including disc-shaped, ellipsoid, square and quadrangular pyramidal nanoparticles, were investigated in solution via UV/vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and SEM microscopy. The different UV/vis as well as fluorescent spectra between nano-porphyrin and its monomer further conformed that the nano-crystallization of porphyrin would result in novel optical properties differing from the single subunits. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.

84886437698	Molecularly imprinted polymeric microspheres with metalloporphyrin-based molecular recognition sites coassembled with methacrylic acid	Molecularly imprinted polymeric microspheres (MIPMs) for dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) were prepared using methacrylic acid (MAA) and vinyl-substituted zinc(ii) porphyrin as functional monomers. The interactions of vinyl-substituted zinc(ii) porphyrin with DMMP were determined by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. A comparison between the MIPMs-MAA that used only MAA with the MIPMs-zinc (Zn) + MAA that used both MAA and Zn porphyrin as functional monomers revealed that the MIPMs-Zn + MAA showed higher binding ability for DMMP. By the Scatchard analysis, the results of the equilibrium adsorption test showed that the MIPM-DMMP only had one affinity binding site. The dissociation constants of MIPMs-Zn + MAA and MIPMs-MAA were 0.167 and 0.338 mmol/L, respectively, and the maximum absorption quantities were 148 and 13.57 μmol/g, respectively. The MIPMs-Zn + MAA possessed the higher selectivity for DMMP as shown by the isotherm binding test. These results revealed that the MIPMs-Zn + MAA had highly specific binding sites because they were assembled by the two functional monomers, vinyl-substituted Zn(ii) porphyrin and MAA, which coordinated to achieve specific binding with DMMP. © The Author(s) 2013.

Sixteen out of twenty-seven dyes were selected to mix with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) in optimized concentration to serve as specific sensing elements, and polyethylene glycol-1000 was chosen from four kinds polyethylene glycols to act as stabilizer. Resultant sensor array shows improved response (about tenfold higher) to aldehydes than former study, and exhibited very good selectivity in low concentration ranging from 40 ppb to 10 ppm with the presence of interfering counterparts. Data analysis was performed by both hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and discriminant analysis (DA), which demonstrates the excellent discrimination ability of the sensor to structurally similar aldehydes related to lung cancer. Besides, formaldehyde-spiked air samples were analyzed with developed sensor array, suggesting promising utilization potentiality to monitor such toxic gas. Theoretical detection limit was down to 8.2 ppb with a liner range from 10 ppb to 150 ppm.

84899843894	A highly efficient organophosphorus pesticides sensor based on CuO nanowires-SWCNTs hybrid nanocomposite	A new electrochemical sensor based on hybrid nanocomposite consisting of copper oxide nanowires (CuO NWs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was first developed for the detection of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs). The surface morphology, chemical composition and crystal structure of the hybrid nanocomposite were studied by SEM and XRD. The hybrid nanocomposite was highly stable and possessed special affinity for malathion, thus providing the basis for facile electrochemical quantification of malathion. The electrochemical behavior of the hybrid nanocomposites based sensor and its application for pesticides determination were first evaluated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Under optimized operational conditions, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was further employed for malathion detection, which shows a wide dynamic range with a limit of detection as low as 0.1 ppb (0.3 nM), good selectivity against other common pesticides, inorganic ions and sugars, as well as good stability and reproducibility. Its application for malathion-spiked liquid garlic samples was also demonstrated. These features implicate the potential applicability of CuO NWs-SWCNTs hybrid nanocomposites in sensitive and selective detection of organophosphorus pesticides. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

MTPP-AuNR nanocomposites were synthetized by solution co-blending method and used to fabricate an optical chemical sensor for identification of lung cancer biomarkers in exhaled breath (VOCs: decane, undecane, hexanal, heptanal, benzene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene). Series of color difference maps of six VOCs were obtained, and principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) were used for further data analysis. The results demonstrated that VOCs could be identified rapidly and accurately by the novel sensor due to the modest sensitivity and selectivity of sensitive materials for VOCs.

Focused on the main flavor components, a new 5×4 colorimetric sensor array was constructed to differentiate 15 different liquor samples after selective screening of 20 specific sensitive materials. The new sensor showed good accuracy to discriminate all liquor samples which was closely related to the main flavor components in the liquors. Data analysis was performed by principal component analysis (PCA), which suggested that the contribution rate of the main flavor components followed a descending order of esters and aldehydes (34.5%), acids (19.2%) and alcohols (11.9%). Further Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) elucidated that analogous liquors sample were correctly classified into one group, and those of the same type from different brands lay closer and were more easier to be clustered. Besides, the clusters indicated good accordance to the similarity of the main flavor components in the liquor, and the distance of different clusters indicated a close relationship between the liquors and raw materials, diastatic fermented agent and brewing process.

Employing dimeric metalloporphyrins, metallosalphen complexes, and chemically responsive dyes as the sensing elements, the developed sensor array of artificial nose shows a unique pattern of colorific changes upon its exposure to eight less-reactive VOCs and their mixture gas at a concentration of 735 nmol/L within 3 min. Potential of quantitative analysis of VOCs samples was proved. A good linear relationship of 490-3675 nmol/L was obtained for benzene vapor with a detection limit of 49 nmol/L(S/N=3). Data analysis was carried out by Hierarchical cluster analysis(HCA) and principal component analysis(PCA). Each category of breath VOCs clusters together in the PCA score plot. No errors in classification by HCA were observed in 45 trials. Additionaly, the colorimetric sensor array showed good reproducibility under the cyclic sensing experiments. These results demonstrate that the developed colorimetric artificial nose system is an excellent sensing platform for the identification and quantitative analysis of breath VOCs of patients with lung cancer. © 2014 Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.
