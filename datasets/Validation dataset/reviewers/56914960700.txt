One method uses an event-based likelihood technique resulting in Mtop=173.2-2.4+2.6(stat)±3.2(syst)GeV/c2 or 173.2-4.0+4.1GeV/c2. The second method reconstructs a top-quark mass in each event using the measured invariant mass of the hadronically decaying W boson to constrain the jet energy scale to obtain a value for Mtop of 173.5-3.6+3.7(stat)±1.3(syst)GeV/c2 or 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2.

33645827984	Top-quark mass measurement from dilepton events at CDF II	We report a measurement of the top-quark mass using events collected by the CDF II detector from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron. We calculate a likelihood function for the top-quark mass in events that are consistent with tt ̄ → b̄ - ν̄ b ′+ν ′ decays. The likelihood is formed as the convolution of the leading-order matrix element and detector resolution functions. The joint likelihood is the product of likelihoods for each of 33 events collected in 340pb-1 of integrated luminosity, yielding a top-quark mass Mt=165.2±6.1(stat)±3.4(syst) GeV/c2. This first application of a matrix-element technique to tt ̄ →b +ν b ̄ ′-ν̄ ′ decays gives the most precise single measurement of Mt in dilepton events.

Scalar bottom quarks can be produced from gluino decays in R-parity conserving models of supersymmetry when the mass of the gluino exceeds that of the scalar bottom quark. Then, a scalar bottom quark can decay into a bottom quark and a neutralino. To search for this scenario, we investigated events with large missing transverse energy and at least three jets, two or more of which were identified as containing a secondary vertex from the hadronization of b quarks. We found four candidate events, where 2.6±0.7 are expected from standard model processes, and placed 95% confidence level lower limits on gluino and scalar bottom quark masses of up to 280 and 240GeV/c2, respectively. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Z bosons are identified in their electron and muon decay modes, and b jets with ET>20GeV and |η|<1.5 are identified by reconstructing a secondary decay vertex. The measurement is based on an integrated luminosity of about 330pb-1. A cross section times branching ratio of σ(Z+bjets)×B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-)=0.93±0.36pb is found, where B(Z→ℓ+ℓ-) is the branching ratio of the Z boson or γ* into a single flavor dilepton pair (e or μ) in the mass range between 66 and 116GeV/c2. The ratio of b jets to the total number of jets of any flavor in the Z sample, within the same kinematic range as the b jets, is 2.36±0.92%. Here, the uncertainties are the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties. Predictions made with next-to-leading order QCD agree, within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, with these measurements. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

A b-tagging algorithm based on the probability of displaced tracks coming from the event interaction vertex is applied to identify b quarks from top decay. Using 318pb-1 of data collected with the CDF II detector, we measure the tt̄ production cross section in events with at least one restrictive (tight) b-tagged jet and obtain 8.9-1.0+1.0(stat)-1.0+1.1(syst)pb. The cross section value assumes a top quark mass of mt=178GeV/c2 in the acceptance corrections. The dependence of the cross section on mt is presented in the paper. This result is consistent with other CDF measurements of the tt̄ cross section using different samples and analysis techniques, and has similar systematic uncertainties. We have also performed consistency checks by using the b-tagging probability function to vary the signal-to-background ratio and also using events that have at least two b-tagged jets. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

34147141823	Measurement of the top quark mass in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using the decay length technique	We report the first measurement of the top quark mass using the decay length technique in pp̄ collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 1.96 TeV. This technique uses the measured flight distance of the b hadron to infer the mass of the top quark in lepton plus jets events with missing transverse energy. It relies solely on tracking and avoids the jet energy scale uncertainty that is common to all other methods used so far. We apply our novel method to a 695pb-1 data sample recorded by the CDF II detector at Fermilab and extract a measurement of mt=180.7-13.4+15.5(stat.)±8.6(syst.)GeV/c2. While the uncertainty of this result is larger than that of other measurements, the dominant uncertainties in the decay length technique are uncorrelated with those in other methods.

34247351071	Observation of WZ production	We report the first observation of the associated production of a W boson and a Z boson. This result is based on 1.1fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. We observe 16 WZ candidates passing our event selection with an expected background of 2.7±0.4 events. A fit to the missing transverse energy distribution indicates an excess of events compared to the background expectation corresponding to a significance equivalent to 6 standard deviations. The measured cross section is σ(pp̄→WZ)=5.0-1.6+1.8pb, consistent with the standard model expectation. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We use a channel with one hadronically-decaying and one electronically-decaying tau. This measurement is based on 350pb-1 of CDF Run II data. Using a sample of 504 opposite sign eτ events with a total expected background of 190 events, we obtain σ(pp̄→4Z)•B(Z→ττ)=264±23(stat) ±14(syst)±15(lumi)pb, in agreement with the next-to-next-to- leading order QCD prediction.

We use the same selection criteria as in a previous CDF Run I search, but with an order-magnitude larger data set, a higher pp̄ collision energy, and the CDF II detector. We find 163 ℓγE T+X events, compared to an expectation of 150.6±13.0 events. We observe 74 ℓγ+X events, compared to an expectation of 65.1±7.7 events.

Many extensions to the standard model predict the production of two leptons of the same electric charge. This search has a significant increase in sensitivity compared to earlier searches. Using a data sample corresponding to 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity recorded by the CDF II detector, we observe no significant excess in an inclusive selection (expect 33.2±4.7 events, observe 44) or in a supersymmetry-optimized selection (expect 7.8±1.1 events, observe 13.) © 2007 The American Physical Society.

34548753335	Search for heavy long-lived particles that decay to photons at CDF II	We present the first search for heavy, long-lived particles that decay to photons at a hadron collider. We use a sample of Î+jet+missing transverse energy events in pp collisions at s=1.96 TeV taken with the CDF II detector. Candidate events are selected based on the arrival time of the photon at the detector. Using an integrated luminosity of 570pb-1 of collision data, we observe 2 events, consistent with the background estimate of 1.3 0.7 events. While our search strategy does not rely on model-specific dynamics, we set cross section limits in a supersymmetric model with I E 10 GE and place the world-best 95% C.L. lower limit on the Ï‡Ëœ10 mass of 101 GeV/c2 at Ï.,Ï‡Ëœ10=5ns. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The analysis is performed using a data sample with an integrated luminosity of about 800pb-1 collected by the CDF II detector. For both vector mesons, we find that the polarizations become increasingly longitudinal as pT increases from 5 to 30GeV/c. These results are compared to the predictions of nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics and other contemporary models. The effective polarizations of J/ψ and ψ(2S) mesons from B-hadron decays are also reported. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

35948994597	Precise measurement of the top-quark mass in the lepton+jets topology at CDF II	We present a measurement of the mass of the top quark from proton-antiproton collisions recorded at the CDF experiment in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron. We analyze events from the single lepton plus jets final state (tt̄→W+bW-b̄→lνbqq̄′b̄). The top-quark mass is extracted using a direct calculation of the probability density that each event corresponds to the tt̄ final state. The probability is a function of both the mass of the top quark and the energy scale of the calorimeter jets, which is constrained in situ by the hadronic W boson mass. Using 167 events observed in 955pb-1 of integrated luminosity, we achieve the single most precise measurement of the top-quark mass, 170.8±2.2(stat.) ±1.4(syst.)GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

A data sample with a luminosity of 1.06fb-1 collected using Z boson decays to ee and μμ is used. We describe a completely data-based method to predict the dominant background from standard model Z+jet events. This method can be similarly applied to other analyses requiring background predictions in multijet environments, as shown when validating the method by predicting the background from W+jets in tt̄ production. No significant excess above the background prediction is observed, and a limit is set using a fourth generation quark model to quantify the acceptance. Assuming BR(b′→bZ)=100% and using a leading-order calculation of the b′ cross section, b′ quark masses below 268GeV/c2 are excluded at 95% confidence level. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We find the diphoton mass spectrum to be in agreement with the standard model expectation, and set limits on the cross section times branching ratio for the Randall-Sundrum graviton, as a function of diphoton mass. We subsequently derive lower limits for the graviton mass of 230GeV/c2 and 850GeV/c2, at the 95% confidence level, for coupling parameters (k/M̄Pl) of 0.01 and 0.1, respectively. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

No significant evidence of such a resonance is observed and we interpret the results to exclude the standard-model-like Z′ with a mass below 923GeV/c2 and the Randall-Sundrum graviton with a mass below 807GeV/c2 for k/M̄pl=0.1, both at the 95% confidence level.

35548967881	Searches for direct pair production of supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We search for direct pair production of supersymmetric top quarks and supersymmetric bottom quarks in proton-antiproton collisions at s=1.96TeV, using 295pb-1 of data recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) experiment. The supersymmetric top (supersymmetric bottom) quarks are selected by reconstructing their decay into a charm (bottom) quark and a neutralino, which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle. The signature of such processes is two energetic heavy-flavor jets and missing transverse energy. The number of events that pass our selection for each search process is consistent with the expected standard model background. By comparing our results to the theoretical production cross sections of the supersymmetric top and supersymmetric bottom quarks in the minimal supersymmetric standard model, we exclude, at a 95% confidence level in the frame of that model, a supersymmetric top quark mass up to 132GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 48GeV/c2, and a supersymmetric bottom quark mass up to 193GeV/c2 for a neutralino mass of 40GeV/c2. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

We select events with six or more jets on which a number of kinematical requirements are imposed by means of a neural network algorithm. At least one of these jets must be identified as initiated by a b-quark candidate by the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The cross section is measured to be σtt̄=8.3±1.0(stat)-1.5+2.0(syst) ±0.5(lumi)pb, which is consistent with the standard model prediction. The top quark mass of 174.0±2.2(stat)±4.8(syst)GeV/c2 is derived from a likelihood fit incorporating reconstructed mass distributions representative of signal and background. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The event signature requires two electromagnetic showers, each with transverse energy ET>5GeV and pseudorapidity |η|<1.0, with no other particles detected in the event. Three candidate events are observed. We discuss the consistency of the three events with γγ, π0π0, or ηη production. The probability that other processes fluctuate to 3 events is 1.7×10-4.

In this search one W decays to leptons, and the other boson (W or Z) decays hadronically.

The search uses a data sample corresponding to approximately 1fb-1 of integrated luminosity. Events consistent with the W→ ν and H→bb̄ signature are selected by triggering on a high-pT electron or muon candidate and tagging one or two of the jet candidates as having originated from b quarks. A neural network filter rejects a fraction of tagged charm and light-flavor jets, increasing the b-jet purity in the sample. We observe no excess νbb̄ production beyond the background expectation, and we set 95% confidence level upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction σ(pp̄→WH)Br(H→bb̄) ranging from 3.9 to 1.3 pb, for specific Higgs boson mass hypotheses in the range 110 to 150GeV/c2, respectively. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 320pb-1 collected with the CDF II detector. W bosons are identified in their electron decay channel and jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm. For each W+≥n-jet sample (n=1-4) we measure the differential cross section dσ(pp̄→W+≥ n-jet)/dETnth-jet×B(W→eν) with respect to the transverse energy ET of the nth-highest ET jet above 20GeV, and the total cross section σ(pp̄→W+≥n-jet;ETnth-jet>25GeV)×B(W→eν), for a restricted W→eν decay phase space. The cross sections, corrected for all detector effects, can be directly compared to particle level W+jet(s) predictions.

33244465223	Top quark mass measurement using the template method in the lepton+jets channel at CDF II	This article presents a measurement of the top quark mass using the CDF II detector at Fermilab. Colliding beams of protons and antiprotons at Fermilab's Tevatron (s=1.96TeV) produce top/antitop pairs, which decay to W+W-bb̄; events are selected where one W decays to hadrons and the other W decays to either e or μ plus a neutrino. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of approximately 318pb-1. A total of 165 tt̄ events are separated into four subsamples based on jet transverse energy thresholds and the number of b jets identified by reconstructing a displaced vertex. In each event, the reconstructed top quark invariant mass is determined by minimizing a χ2 for the overconstrained kinematic system. At the same time, the mass of the hadronically decaying W boson is measured in the same event sample. The observed W boson mass provides an in situ improvement in the determination of the hadronic jet energy scale. A simultaneous likelihood fit of the reconstructed top quark masses and the W boson invariant masses in the data sample to distributions from simulated signal and background events gives a top quark mass of 173.5-3.8+3.9GeV/c2. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The background from nonprompt sources is determined using a statistical method based on differences in the electromagnetic showers.

33644951561	Measurement of the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays	We measure the dipion mass spectrum in X(3872)→J/ψπ+π- decays using 360pb-1 of p̄p collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the CDFÂ II detector. The spectrum is fit with predictions for odd C-parity (S13, P11, and DJ3) charmonia decaying to J/ψπ+π-, as well as even C-parity states in which the pions are from ρ0 decay. The latter case also encompasses exotic interpretations, such as a D0D̄*0 molecule. Only the S13 and J/ψρ hypotheses are compatible with our data. Since S13 is untenable on other grounds, decay via J/ψρ is favored, which implies C=+1 for the X(3872). Models for different J/ψ-ρ angular momenta L are considered. Flexibility in the models, especially the introduction of ρ-ω interference, enables good descriptions of our data for both L=0 and 1. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

The data were collected at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) and correspond to integrated luminosities between 0.7 and 1.0fb-1. We look for final states with one high-pT electron or muon, and two additional leptons. Our results are consistent with the standard model expectations, and we set limits on the cross section as a function of the chargino mass in three different supersymmetric scenarios.

For fully reconstructed candidate tt̄ events triggered on leptons with large transverse momentum and containing at least one identified b-quark jet, we compare the invariant mass spectrum of tt̄ pairs to the expected superposition of standard model tt̄, non-tt̄ backgrounds, and a simple resonance model based on a sequential Z′ boson. We establish upper limits for σ(pp̄→Z′) ·Br(Z′→tt̄) in the Z′ mass interval from 450GeV/c2 to 900GeV/c2. A topcolor leptophobic Z′ is ruled out below 720GeV/c2, and the cross section of any narrow Z′-like state decaying to tt̄ is found to be less than 0.64 pb at 95% C.L. for MZ′ above 700GeV/c2. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

42449091495	Measurement of ratios of fragmentation fractions for bottom hadrons in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	This paper describes the first measurement of b-quark fragmentation fractions into bottom hadrons in Run II of the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab. The result is based on a 360pb-1 sample of data collected with the CDF II detector in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV. Semileptonic decays of B̄0, B-, and B̄s0 mesons, as well as Λb0 baryons, are reconstructed. For an effective bottom hadron pT threshold of 7GeV/c, the fragmentation fractions are measured to be fu/fd=1.054±0.018(stat)-0.045+0.025(sys)±0. 058(B), fs/(fu+fd)=0.160±0.005(stat)-0.010+0.011(sys)-0.034+0.057(B), and fΛb/(fu+fd)=0.281±0.012(stat)-0.056+0.058(sys)-0.087+0.128(B), where the uncertainty B is due to uncertainties on measured branching ratios. The value of fs/(fu+fd) agrees within one standard deviation with previous CDF measurements and the world average of this quantity, which is dominated by LEP measurements. However, the ratio fΛb/(fu+fd) is approximately twice the value previously measured at LEP. The approximately 2σ discrepancy is examined in terms of kinematic differences between the two production environments. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Results are obtained for charged particles within a restricted cone with an opening angle of 0.5 radians around the jet axis and for events with dijet masses between 66 and 563GeV/c2. A comparison of the experimental data to theoretical predictions obtained for partons within the framework of resummed perturbative QCD in the next-to-leading log approximation shows that the parton momentum correlations survive the hadronization stage of jet fragmentation, giving further support to the hypothesis of local parton-hadron duality. The extracted value of the next-to-leading-log-approximation parton shower cutoff scale Qeff set equal to ΛQCD is found to be (1.4-0.7+0.9)×100MeV. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We use ∼1fb-1 integrated luminosity of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV recorded by the Collider Detector at Fermilab II experiment at the Tevatron. We find 268 (16) single (double) b-tagged candidate events, where 248±43 (14.4±2.7) are expected from standard model background processes. We observe no significant excess over the expected background and thus set 95% confidence level upper limits on the Higgs boson production cross section for several Higgs boson masses ranging from 110 to 140GeV/c2. For a mass of 115GeV/c2, the observed (expected) limit is 20.4 (14.2) times the standard model prediction. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

In the combination of ′ ′ and νν channels, we observe an excess of events with a probability of 5.1×10-6 to be due to the expected background. This corresponds to a significance of 4.4 standard deviations.

Our results, which use 360pb-1 of data recorded with the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider, are σ(tt̄)=8.5-2.2+2.7pb, σ(W+W-)=16.3-4. 4+5.2pb, and σ(Z0→τ+τ-)=291-46+50pb. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

48749132429	Search for new heavy particles decaying to Z0Z0→eeee in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report the results of a search for the anomalous production of a massive particle decaying to four electrons via two Z0 bosons in 1.1fb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected by the CDF II detector at Fermilab. We employ optimized electron identification criteria to maximize acceptance and efficiency. We estimate the backgrounds in the invariant mass range 500-1000GeV/c2 to be 0.028±0.009(stat)±0.011(syst) events. We observe zero events in this search region. Assuming a Randall-Sundrum graviton production model, we set 95% C.L. limits on σ×BF(G→Z0Z0)<4- 6pb, depending on the graviton mass. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

48249102018	Model-independent and quasi-model-independent search for new physics at CDF	Data collected in run II of the Fermilab Tevatron are searched for indications of new electroweak scale physics. Rather than focusing on particular new physics scenarios, CDF data are analyzed for discrepancies with respect to the standard model prediction. A model-independent approach (Vista) considers the gross features of the data and is sensitive to new large cross section physics. A quasi-model-independent approach (Sleuth) searches for a significant excess of events with large summed transverse momentum and is particularly sensitive to new electroweak scale physics that appears predominantly in one final state. This global search for new physics in over 300 exclusive final states in 927pb-1 of pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV reveals no such significant indication of physics beyond the standard model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

53349160646	Measurement of the inclusive jet cross section at the Fermilab Tevatron pp̄ collider using a cone-based jet algorithm	We present a measurement of the inclusive jet cross section in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV based on data collected by the CDF II detector with an integrated luminosity of 1.13fb-1. The measurement was made using the cone-based midpoint jet clustering algorithm in the rapidity region of |y|<2.1. The results are consistent with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions based on recent parton distribution functions (PDFs), and are expected to provide increased precision in PDFs at high parton momentum fraction x. The results are also compared to the recent inclusive jet cross section measurement using the kT jet clustering algorithm, and we find that the ratio of the cross sections measured with the two algorithms is in agreement with theoretical expectations over a large range of jet transverse momentum and rapidity. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

55749096770	Search for large extra dimensions in final states containing one photon or jet and large missing transverse energy produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present the results of searches for large extra dimensions in samples of events with large missing transverse energy E T and either a photon or a jet produced in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab II. For γ+E T and jet+E T candidate samples corresponding to 2.0 and 1.1fb-1 of integrated luminosity, respectively, we observe good agreement with standard model expectations and obtain a combined lower limit on the fundamental parameter of the large extra dimensions model MD as a function of the number of extra dimensions in the model. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

55149086109	Measurement of b-jet shapes in inclusive jet production in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a measurement of the shapes of b-jets using 300pb-1 of data obtained with the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II) in pp̄ collisions at center-of-mass energy s=1.96TeV. This measurement covers a wide transverse momentum range, from 52 to 300GeV/c. Samples of heavy-flavor enhanced jets together with inclusive jets are used to extract the average shapes of b-jets. The b-jets are expected to be broader than inclusive jets. Moreover, b-jets containing a single b-quark are expected to be narrower than those containing a bb̄ pair from gluon splitting. The measured b-jet shapes are found to be significantly broader than expected from the pythia and herwig Monte Carlo simulations. This effect may arise from an underestimation of the fraction of b-jets originating from gluon splitting in these simulations. The jet shape distributions provided in this paper could be compared to any full Monte Carlo simulation and could be used to further constrain the various parameters. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

56349158697	Search for the flavor-changing neutral-current decay t→Zq in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV	We report a search for the flavor-changing neutral-current decay of the top quark t→Zq (q=u, c) in pp̄ collisions at s=1.96TeV using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.9fb-1 collected by the CDF II detector. This decay is strongly suppressed in the standard model and an observation of a signal at the Fermilab Tevatron would be an indication of physics beyond the standard model. Using Z+4 jet final state candidate events, with and without an identified bottom quark jet, we obtain an upper limit of B(t→Zq)<3.7% at 95% C.L. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

57949096387	Search for the Higgs Boson Produced in Association with Z→ℓ+ℓ- in pp̄ Collisions at s=1.96TeV	We present a search for the Higgs boson in the process qq̄→ ZH→ℓ+ℓ-bb̄. The analysis uses an integrated luminosity of 1fb-1 of pp̄ collisions produced at s=1.96TeV and accumulated by the upgraded Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF II). We employ artificial neural networks both to correct jets mismeasured in the calorimeter and to distinguish the signal kinematic distributions from those of the background. We see no evidence for Higgs boson production, and set 95% C.L. upper limits on σZHB(H→bb̄), ranging from 1.5 to 1.2 pb for a Higgs boson mass (mH) of 110 to 150GeV/c2. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

84875948962	Measurement of the J/ψ meson and b-hadron production cross sections in pp̄ collisions at √s = 1960 GeV	We present a new measurement of the inclusive and differential production cross sections of J/ψ mesons and b hadrons in proton-antiproton collisions at √s = 1960 GeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 39.7 pb<sup>-1</sup> collected by the CDF run II detector.

We separate the fraction of J/ψ events from the decay of the long-lived b hadrons using the lifetime distribution in all events with p<inf>T</inf>(J/ψ) > 1.25 GeV/c. We find the total cross section for b hadrons, including both hadrons and antihadrons, decaying to J/ψ with transverse momenta greater than 1.25 GeV/c in the rapidity range |y(J/ψ)| < 0.6 is 0.330 ± 0.005(stat) <inf>-0.033</inf><sup>+0.036</sup>(syst) μb. Using a Monte Carlo simulation of the decay kinematics of b hadrons to all final states containing a J/ψ, we extract the first measurement of the total single b-hadron cross section down to zero transverse momentum at √s = 1960 GeV. We find the total single b-hadron cross section integrated over all transverse momenta for b hadrons in the rapidity range |y| < 0.6 to be 17.6 ± 0.4(stat) <inf>-2.3</inf><sup>+2.5</sup>(syst) μb. © 2005 The American Physical Society.
