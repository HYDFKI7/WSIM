84928160423	Gene expression profiling in human lung development: An abundant resource for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis	A tumor can be viewed as a special "organ" that undergoes aberrant and poorly regulated organogenesis. Progress in cancer prognosis and therapy might be facilitated by re-examining distinctive processes that operate during normal development, to elucidate the intrinsic features of cancer that are significantly obscured by its heterogeneity. The global gene expression signatures of 44 human lung tissues at four development stages from Asian descent and 69 lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) tissue samples from ethnic Chinese patients were profiled using microarrays. All of the genes were classified into 27 distinct groups based on their expression patterns (named as PTN1 to PTN27) during the developmental process. In lung ADC, genes whose expression levels decreased steadily during lung development (genes in PTN1) generally had their expression reactivated, while those with uniformly increasing expression levels (genes in PTN27) had their expression suppressed. The genes in PTN1 contain many n-gene signatures that are of prognostic value for lung ADC. The prognostic relevance of a 12-gene demonstrator for patient survival was characterized in five cohorts of healthy and ADC patients [ADC-CICAMS (n = 69, p = 0.007), ADC-PNAS (n = 125, p = 0.0063), ADC-GSE13213 (n = 117, p = 0.0027), ADC-GSE8894 (n = 62, p = 0.01), and ADC-NCI (n = 282, p = 0.045)] and in four groups of stage I patients [ADC-CICAMS (n = 22, p = 0.017), ADC-PNAS (n = 76, p = 0.018), ADC-GSE13213 (n = 79, p = 0.02), and ADC-qPCR (n = 62, p = 0.006)]. In conclusion, by comparison of gene expression profiles during human lung developmental process and lung ADC progression, we revealed that the genes with a uniformly decreasing expression pattern during lung development are of enormous prognostic value for lung ADC. © 2014 Feng et al.

14344262646	RNA silencing technologies in drug discovery and target validation	With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is an increasing, substantial need to apply RNA silencing technologies to post-genome research. In this review, we focus on three silencing technologies: antisense, RNA interference, and ribozymes. These RNA silencing approaches are designed to specifically block gene expression, and have applications in investigations of gene function, pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics, and identification of novel targets for therapy. With high specificity and affinity, oligonucleotide therapeutic agents are being developed as novel treatments for various diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and infectious diseases. These drugs can be used alone or in combination with current treatment strategies including chemotherapy or radiation therapy. However, the potential of these therapeutic agents based on RNA silencing technologies has not yet been fully realized, and further investigations are needed to define their specificity and efficacy, especially in the clinical setting.

14644403700	MDM2 and human malignancies: Expression, clinical pathology, prognostic markers, and implications for chemotherapy	The human homologue of the mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) oncogene is overexpressed in more than forty different types of malignancies, including solid tumors, sarcomas and leukemias. Because of its prevalent expression and its interactions with p53 and other signaling molecules, MDM2 plays a central role in cancer development and progression. The expression of this oncoprotein is being studied by researchers world-wide, and the amount of data published about it is increasing exponentially. Although there are some conflicting data about the effects of MDM2 expression in individual cancers, the overall evidence is convincing, indicating that increased MDM2 expression is related to a worse clinical prognosis. There is an increased likelihood of distant metastases, as well as a decreased response to therapeutic intervention in MDM2-positive cancers. MDM2 may also serve as a diagnostic marker, not only for cancer stage, but to differentiate between similar cancers. MDM2 may also be associated with drug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. These findings make studying the oncoprotein necessary to aid in our understanding of cancer development, to identify novel cancer drug targets, and to increase the efficacy of cancer therapy. © 2005 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

20944446165	Influence of number of metastatic lymph nodes on survival of curative resected thoracic esophageal cancer patients and value of radiotherapy: Report of 549 cases	Purpose: To analyze the significance of the number of metastatic lymph nodes on survival with and without the addition of prophylactic postoperative radiotherapy (RT) after radical resection of thoracic esophageal carcinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 549 thoracic esophageal squamous cell cancer patients who had undergone radical resection were randomized by the envelope method into a surgery-alone group (S, n = 275) and a surgery plus RT group (S+R, n = 274). We performed a retrospective review of all patients according to the extent of metastasis. The patients were classified into three groups: Group 1, 269 patients (49.0%) without lymph node involvement; Group 2, 159 patients (29.0%) with one to two positive nodes; and Group 3, 121 patients (22.0%) with three or more positive lymph nodes. Results: For the same T stage (T3), the 5-year survival rate for Groups 1, 2, and 3 was 50.6%, 29.3%, and 11.7%, respectively (p = 0.0000). For patients with Stage III, the 5-year survival rate for Groups 1 (T4N0M0), 2 (T3-T4N1M0), and 3 (T3-T4N2M0) was 58.1%, 30.6%, and 14.4%, respectively (p = 0.0092). The 5-year survival rate of the S and S+R groups with positive lymph nodes (Groups 2 and 3) was 17.6% and 34.1% (p = 0.0378). In the positive lymph node groups, the incidence of failure by intrathoracic lymph node metastasis and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis in the S+R group (21.5% and 4.6%, respectively) was lower than in the S group (35.9% and 19.7%, respectively; p <0.012). In the negative lymph node group, the incidence of failure by intrathoracic lymph node metastasis in the S and S+R groups was 27.8% and 13.3%, respectively (p = 0.006). Hematogenous metastasis was the greatest (27.5%) in Group 3 (three or more positive lymph nodes). Conclusion: The number of metastatic lymph nodes is one of the important factors affecting the survival of patients with thoracic esophageal carcinoma. In our study, postoperative RT improved the survival of patients with positive lymph nodes. Additionally, postoperative RT reduced the incidence of intrathoracic recurrence and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis for all patients. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

1942473020	The effects of Rb AS-ODN on apoptosis and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells	AIM: To investigate the effects of Rb AS-ODN on apoptosis and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. METHODS: A cationic liposome was selected as a delivery vehicle. HT-29 cells were transfected with Rb AS-ODN, M S-ODN and LP in vitro. The expression of pRb treated with or without AS-ODN, M S-ODN and LP in HT-29 cells were observed by Streptavidin-Peroxidase (S-P) immunohistochemical method and Western Blot analysis. The Flow cytometer (FCM) was used to examine apoptosis induced by 5-Fu in HT-29 cells. The MTT assay was used to measure chemotherapeutic agent-sensitivity of HT-29 cells treated with 5-Fu. RESULTS: The level of pRb expression in the HT-29 colon cancer line transfected with Rb AS-ODN obviously reduced compared with that of controls, which were treated with S-ODN, LP and non-transfected (P<0.05). The percentage of the apoptotic cells and drug-sensitivity of HT-29 cells of the treatment with Rb AS-ODN to 5-Fu decreased compared with that of the control (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The transfection of Rb AS-ODN delivered by cationic liposome could inhibit apoptosis induced by 5-Fu in HT-29 cells and decrease drug-sensitivity of HT-29 cells to 5-Fu.

23044456690	Analysis of suppressive role of RASSF1A gene at 3p21.3 in lung cancer cell line A549	Objective: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 3p21.3 is a common and early event in the development of lung cancer, implying the presence of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) that may be involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. RASSF1A gene, located at this region, containing the Ras-associated domain, has been considered as a candidate tumor suppressor gene because of high frequency of loss of expression and aberrant promoter hypermethylation in most NSCLCs and SCLCs. This study was designed to transfer the expression vector containing RASSF1A to NSCLC cell line A549 to analyze the effect of this gene ś exogenous expression. Methods: Transfer the pcDNA3.1 and pcDNA3.1-RASSF1A into A549 cells by lipofectamine 2000 respectively, the apoptosis and the changes of cell cycle of transient-transfected cells were analyses by flow cytometry (FCM), cellular proliferation of the stable-transfected was examined by MTT assay, cell growth curve and colony formation assay. Inhibition of lung metastasis in nude mice of RASSF1A exogenous expression was also investigated. Results: The progression of the cell cycle was arrested in G1-phase remarkably induced by RASSF1A (P < 0.001); the cell viability, growing speed and colony formation ability were decreased obviously by exogenous expression of RASSF1A (P < 0.01). The lung metastasis in nude mouse was also significantly inhibited (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The experimental results show that RASSF1A plays an important roles in origination, progression and metastasis of lung cancer.

23044475761	Loss of tumor suppressor p53 decreases PTEN expression and enhances signaling pathways leading to activation of activator protein 1 and nuclear factor κB induced by UV radiation	Transcription factor p53 and phosphatase PTEN are two tumor suppressors that play essential roles in suppression of carcinogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which p53 mediates anticancer activity and the relationship between p53 and PTEN are not well understood. In the present study, we found that pretreatment of mouse epidermal C141 cells with pifithrin-α, an inhibitor for p53-dependent transcriptional activation, resulted in a marked increase in UV-induced activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Consistent with activation of AP-1 and NF-κB, pifithrin-α was also able to enhance the UV-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun-NH

0001421182	Structures of nucleolus and transcription sites of rRNA genes in rat liver cells	We observed the ultrastructure of nucleolus in rat liver cells by conventional electron microscopy, and employed cytochemistry NAMA-Ur DNA specific stain method to analyze the distribution and position of nucleolar DNA in situ. The results showed that nucleolar DNA of rat liver cells comes from nucleolus-associated chromatin, and continuously extends in the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of nucleolus, localizes at the periphery of fibrillar center (FC) and in DFC. Furthermore, by employing anti-DNA/RNA hybrid antibodies, we directly and selectively labeled transcription sites of rRNA genes and testified that localization of transcription sites not only to DFC but also to the periphery of FC.

27644516753	An approach to studying lung cancer-related proteins in human blood	Early stage lung cancer detection is the first step toward successful clinical therapy and increased patient survival. Clinicians monitor cancer progression by profiling tumor cell proteins in the blood plasma of afflicted patients. Blood plasma, however, is a difficult cancer protein assessment medium because it is rich in albumins and heterogeneous protein species. We report herein a method to detect the proteins released into the circulatory system by tumor cells. Initially we analyzed the protein components in the conditioned medium (CM) of lung cancer primary cell or organ cultures and in the adjacent normal bronchus using one-dimensional PAGE and nano-ESI-MS/MS. We identified 299 proteins involved in key cellular process such as cell growth, organogenesis, and signal transduction. We selected 13 interesting proteins from this list and analyzed them in 628 blood plasma samples using ELISA. We detected 11 of these 13 proteins in the plasma of lung cancer patients and non-patient controls. Our results showed that plasma matrix metalloproteinase 1 levels were elevated significantly in late stage lung cancer patients and that the plasma levels of 14-3-3 σ, β, and η in the lung cancer patients were significantly lower than those in the control subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first time that fascin, ezrin, CD98, annexin A4, 14-3-3 σ, 14-3-3 β, and 14-3-3 η proteins have been detected in human plasma by ELISA. The preliminary results showed that a combination of CD98, fascin, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor/secretory component and 14-3-3 η had a higher sensitivity and specificity than any single marker. In conclusion, we report a method to detect proteins released into blood by lung cancer. This pilot approach may lead to the identification of novel protein markers in blood and provide a new method of identifying tumor biomarker profiles for guiding both early detection and therapy of human cancer. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

33749343523	ERK is involved in the differentiation induced by diallyl disulfide in the human gastric cancer cell line MGC803	Diallyl disulfide (DADS) is a major constituent of garlic. Previously, we found that DADS both inhibited proliferation in human gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and induced G2/M arrest. In this study, we investigated whether this differentiation effect was induced by DADS in human gastric cancer MGC803 cells, and whether it was related to an alteration in ERK activity. The results showed that the growth of MGC803 cells was inhibited by DADS. Cells treated with DADS displayed a lower nucleocytoplasmic ratio and tended to form gland and intercellular conjunction structures. The ConA-mediated cell agglutination ratio and cells' ALP specific activity decreased. In MGC803 cells, dye transfer was limited to a few cells neighbouring the dye-injected cell and to a depth of 1-2 layers beneath the scrape site. However, after treatment with DADS, the LY (Lucifer Yellow) was transferred to several cells immediately neighbouring the microinjected cell and to a depth of 2-4 cell layers from the scrape site. This indicated that DADS induced differentiation in MGC803 cells. Western blot analysis revealed that although DADS did not influence the quantity of ERK1/2 protein expressed, it did decrease its phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner, compared with the controls.

33749537296	Reactive oxygen species regulate epidermal growth factor-induced vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression through activation of AKT and P70S6K1 in human ovarian cancer cells	The epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor (EGFR) family are often overexpressed in various human cancers including ovarian cancer. While it is generally believed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the intracellular signaling events, the role of ROS in EGF-induced angiogenesis and carcinogenesis remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the role of ROS in the regulation of AKT, p70S6K1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in ovarian cancer cells.

33750470343	SNP767A/T of FUS2 gene and lung cancer risk in Chinese population	Background and objective: FUS2 gene locating at 3p21.3 is considered a promising candidate tumor suppressor gene. The aim of this study is to examine the difference in FUS2-767A/T polymorphism site between lung cancer patients and normal controls in Chinese population. Methods: The genotype FUS2-767A/ T was detected in 146 lung cancer patients and 113 normal controls by PCR-SSCP method. The relationship between lung cancer risk and difference in genotypes of FUS2 gene was analysed. Results: FUS2-767A/T was significantly related to histological type (P = 0.044), age of the patients with lung cancer (P = 0.011) and vessel cancer embolus (P = 0.031) in lung cancer group. There was no significant difference in distribution of FUS2 genotypes between lung cancer patients and normal controls (P = 0.945). Conclusion: The results suggest that the FUS2-767A/T polymorphism may be a susceptibility factor for lung cancer among Chinese population.

33847626362	Overexpression of Pin1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its correlation with lymph node metastases	Background: Pin1 isomerizes the bonds of molecules important for numerous oncogenic and cell-signaling pathways, including Bcl-2, p53, c-Jun, β-catenin, NF-κB, cyclin D1, c-Myc and Raf-1. This can cause a change in conformation leading to alterations in catalytic activity, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization and protein stability. These alterations have been shown to be associated with cell transformation and cancer progression. Pin1 is overexpressed in several different human cancers. This is the first report of Pin1 overexpression in clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Protein expression levels of Pin1 in tumor and normal lung specimens were analyzed for expression of Pin1, cyclin D1, p53 and MDM2 using immunohistochemistry and compared to several clinicopathological characteristics. The mRNA expression of Pin1 was also analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and compared to clinicopathological characteristics. Results: Pin1 protein was shown to be overexpressed in NSCLC tumor samples, and correlated with lymph node positive disease and tumor stage. High expression of MDM2 also correlated with lymph node positive disease and with poorly differentiated tumors. High expression of MDM2 also correlated with lymph node positive disease and with poorly differentiated tumors. High expression levels of Pin1 correlated with high levels of p53 or MDM2 protein, but did not show a correlation with cyclin D1. However, high levels of MDM2 correlated with cyclin D1 overexpression. Pin1 mRNA was expressed significantly more often in the tumors of smokers than of non-smokers. The relationship between the expression of protein and mRNA of Pin1 has obviously showed that protein expression isn't significantly associated with mRNA expression. Conclusions: Pin1 is overexpressed in many different cancers, including NSCLC, and may possibly be used as a tumor marker or as a target for cancer therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33947691780	Management of primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus	Background: Primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus is rare. Although surgery is successful in eradicating local tumor, the five-year survival rate of patients with primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus after resection is lower than that of patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical manifestations, pathological features and treatment of primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Methods: A total of 73 patients with primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus who had been treated by surgery from 1984 to 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. Results: In this series, the overall resection rate was 94.5% (69/73), the radical resection rate 89.0% (65/73) and the operative mortality 1.4% (1/73). The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients were 50.7%, 13.7% and 8.2%, respectively. Conclusions: Primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus is rare with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection is the leading method for patients with stage I or II primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Postoperative chemotherapy is beneficial to these patients. The patients of stage III or IV should be given chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

34447578791	Characteristics and prognosis of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus	Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus is an extremely rare but highly aggressive tumor. The preoperative diagnosis is complicated for the lack of specificity. Unfortunately, the prognosis of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus remains dismal from most literatures. To better understand this special condition, we reviewed the medical records of patients with primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus in our center, retrospectively. Seven cases were seen at Cancer Hospital (Institute) of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from 1975 through 2006. Six patients had complete clinical data. Of the six patients, two were females and four were males. The patients mean age was 51 years, ranging from 41 to 60 years. Similar to esophageal carcinoma, dysphagia was the most common symptom. Only one patient, however, was pathologically diagnosed as primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus preoperatively. Surgical procedures were performed to all patients. Among the six patients one accepted radiotherapy perioperatively. Four patients accepted biochemotherapy postoperatively. The most common reason for death was metastasis. Four of the six patients had metastasis to the liver, adrenal gland, heart and lymph nodes, respectively. The survival varied from 5 months to 17 years and the median survival was 8 months. Our data show that primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Surgery remains the first selected therapy. The role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus is still uncertain. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34547427442	RhoA and RhoC -siRNA inhibit the proliferation and invasiveness activity of human gastric carcinoma by Rho/PI3K/Akt pathway	Aim: To evaluate the effects of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of RhoA siRNA and RhoC siRNA on proliferation and invasion of SGC7901 cells by Rho/PI3K/Akt pathway. Methods: Plasmid of RhoA siRNA and RhoC siRNA were constructed and transfected into SGC7901 cells. siRNA and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) were designed as the control group. The mRNA and protein expressions of RhoA and RhoC were respectively detected with RT-PCR and western blotting. In order to find out the changes of proliferation and invasion power of SGC7901 cell lines, we analyzed the data by MTT, Boyden chamber and evaluated apoptosis of cell with flow cytometry. We treated BALB /C nude mice with RhoA and RhoC-siRNA, and tumor control rate (%) in nude mice was calculated. Results: RhoA and RhoC siRNA transfections specifically down-regulated the corresponding mRNA and protein levels in SGC7901 Cells.The experiment of permeated artificial basal membrane showed that the invasion power of SGC7901 cell lines are on the decline after treatment of Ad-RhoA and RhoC-siRNA (12.64 ± 3.27 vs 87.38 ± 17.38, P < 0.05). The values of 490 nm wavelength light absorption were different in the five groups. The number of alive cells in the group of RhoA and RhoC-siRNA was lower than others in the 6th d (0.71 ± 0.01 vs 3.82 ± 0,11 P < 0.05). The apoptosis rate of transfected RhoA and RhoC-siRNA group with FACS were 19.07% ± 1.78 and there were significant differences between treated and control groups (19.07 ± 1.78% vs 1.23 ± 0.11%, P < 0.01). The tumor transplantation experiment in BALB/C nude mice showed intratumoral injection of RhoA or RhoC siRNA can inhibit tumor growth. Conclusion: RhoA and RhoC siRNA gene therapy mediated by adenovirus may be useful for inhibiting growth and invasion of SGC7901 through a PI3K/ Akt pathway. These results provide a novel therapeutic target in preventing gastric cancer cell invasion and metastas. © 2007 WJG. All rights reserved.

34548547220	Overexpression of RhoE has a prognostic value in non-small cell lung cancer	Background: Increasing evidence has suggested that RhoE plays an important role in carcinogenesis and progression. However, the correlation between RhoE expression and clinical outcome in lung cancer has not been investigated. Methods: RhoE expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray containing samples from 115 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a median follow-up of 54 months. Results: RhoE was overexpressed in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells compared with undetectable expression of RhoE in the adjacent nontumoral cells. Patients with RhoE-negative tumors had substantially longer cancer-related survival than did patients with RhoE-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that RhoE overexpression was an independent marker for cancer-related survival in the entire population after adjusting for other prognostic factors. Conclusions: RhoE expression may serve as an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.

34548083697	Diagnosis and surgical treatment of pulmonary sequestration	Objective: To investigate the classification, incidence, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and surgical treatment of pulmonary sequestration. Methods: The clinical data of 23 patients with pulmonary sequestration, 13 males and 10 females, aged 39 (12-71), with a course of 3 days to 9 years, hospitalized during the period from May 1974 to November 2006, were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The cases of sequestration were presents which were resected and confirmed by pathology in our department. The incident rate of pulmonary sequestration was 0.29% among the patients who underwent operation during that period. Nineteen (83%) of the 23 patients suffered from interloper pulmonary sequestration and 4 suffered from extralobar pulmonary sequestration. Eighteen of the 23 patients had recurrent pneumonia with the clinical manifestations of cough. fever, and hemoptysis. Fourteen cases got confirmed diagnosis before operation. Conclusion: The diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration mainly depends on X-ray, CT and MRL The sequestration should be removed whenever it is diagnosed.

34548575188	Amplification and overexpression of Aurora-A in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Aurora-A/BTAK/STK15 gene which encodes a centrosome-associated kinase is located on chromosome 20q13.2, a highly amplified region in various human tumors. Recent studies have demonstrated the overexpression and amplification of Aurora-A in many malignant human cancers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the amplification and expression of Aurora-A in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Amplification of Aurora-A was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 7 esophageal cancer cell lines and real-time PCR in 29 esophageal cancer samples. We detected Aurora-A expression in 7 esophageal cancer cell lines and 38 esophageal cancers samples by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot hybridization. The amplification of Aurora-A was detected in 27 of 29 (93.1%) esophageal cancer samples and 6 of 7 (85.7%) cancer cell lines. Aurora-A was overexpressed in 27 of 38 (71.1%) esophageal cancer samples and all 7 esophageal cancer cell lines. We conclude that Aurora-A is amplified and overexpressed in esophageal squamous cancer.

34548701788	UTRN on chromosome 6q24 is mutated in multiple tumors	Though deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 is one of the most common aberrations in tumors, its targeted gene(s) has not been convincingly identified. Using a functional screening approach, we found that UTRN (which encodes utrophin, a dystrophin-related protein) at 6q24, when expressed in an antisense orientation, induced cellular transformation, consistent with a tumor suppressor role. Northern blot analysis, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and gene expression arrays all showed that UTRN expression was downregulated in primary tumors compared with matched normal tissues. Several UTRN neighbor genes were not affected in some tumors with UTRN downregulation, suggesting that UTRN was specifically targeted. RT-PCR, coupled with an in vitro transcription and translation assay, revealed inactivation mutations in 21/62 breast cancers, 4/20 neuroblastomas and 4/15 malignant melanomas. Most of the mutations were deletions involving one or more exons that led to the truncation of utrophin. Splicing errors were found in two cases, and nonsense mutation in one case. Overexpression of a wild-type UTRN in breast cancer cells inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro and reduced their tumor potential in nude mice. Our studies suggest that UTRN is a candidate tumor suppressor gene. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

34548224589	The study on the chromosome aneuploidy in human lung cancer	Objective: To study the feasibility of interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in detection of chromosomal aneuploidy in touch preparations of lung carcinoma and its clinic significance. Methods: We examined 46 touch preparations of lung carcinomas by FISH with DNA specific for chromosomes 7, 8, 9 and 12 to detect chromosomal aneuploidy. Results: Aneuploidy, mainly featured in gains of chromosomes 7, 8 and 12 and loss of chromosome 9 were observed in all of the touch preparations of the 46 cases with lung cancer. The rates of chromosomal aneuploidy detected by FISH were 67.4% (31/46), 60.9% (28/46), 28.3% (13/46) and 56.5% (26/31) respectively. Conclusion: Interphase FISH is feasible in detecting aneuploidy in touch preparations of lung cancer. These alterations may be applied to early diagnosis and predicting prognosis of lung cancer.

36049049384	High expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells in Chinese primary non-small cell lung cancer tissues	Purpose: Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) has been reported to be involved in the development of various types of cancer including adenocarcinoma of the breast. This research was the first to investigate NFAT protein expression in primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues from Chinese patients. Methods: NFAT protein expression was determined in 130 surgically resected primary NSCLC and matched normal tissues by immunohistochemical analysis. The association between NFAT expression and clinical categorical variables was further analyzed with the SPSS software. Results: We found that NFAT expression was much higher in 85 tumor tissues (65.4%) and lower in 45 tumor tissues (34.6%) compared with the matched normal tissues. Further statistical analysis by the chi-square test showed that high expression of NFAT proteins was significantly associated with tumor differentiation (p=0.045), invasion (p=0.031), histology (p<0.0001), tumor size (p=0.038) and cigarette smoking history (p=0.024). However, there was no correlation between the expression of NFAT proteins and pTNM classification, and no difference in 5-year survival rate between patients with high or low expression of NFAT proteins. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for the correlation between NFAT protein expression levels and various characteristics showed a significant association with histology (p=0.008, OR=0.273). Conclusion: Our results revealed that high NFAT expression was present in Chinese NSCLCs and that NFAT expression might be involved in the process of human lung cancer development. © 2007 Wichtig Editore.

The purpose of this study is to examine the prognostic factors of surgical resection in patients more than 70 years of age. Methods: Data were retrospectively analyzed from 192 patients aged ≥70 years who underwent lung cancer surgery. Of these patients, 48.4% were in stage I, 20.8% in stage II, 19.3% in stage III, and 2.1% in stage IV. Patient demographics were the following: 79.2% male and 20.8% female; 21.9% ≥75 years older; and 11.5% had significant co-morbidities. Tumor characteristics: squamous cell carcinoma 49.0%, adenocarcinoma 35.9%, adenosquamous carcinoma 8.3%, small cell lung cancer 4.7%, others 2.1%. Operations: exploration 2.1%, wedge resection 8.3%, lobectomy 72.4%, more than lobectomy 12.5%, pneumonectomy 4.7%. Of these operations, 91.1% were radical surgery. The significance of prognostic factors was assessed by univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses. Results: The total 5-year survival rate was 33.5% in this series. Age, sex, symptom and co-morbidity had no impact on survival. Multivariable COX analysis demonstrated that incomplete resection (P = 0.003), advanced surgical-pathological stage (P<0.001) and other type of the tumor (P = 0.016) were significant, independent, unfavorable prognostic determinants in patients. Conclusion: Thoracic surgery is a safe and feasible approach in elderly patients with lung cancer. Every effort should be made to detect early stage patients who might benefit from surgical treatment. Lobectomy is still the ideal surgical option for elderly patients who are able to tolerate the procedure. More limited lung surgery may be an adequate alternative in patients with associated co-morbidities.

0032707552	Germline mutations of p53 but not p16/CDKN2 or PTEN/MMAC1 tumor suppressor genes predispose to gliomas	Constitutional DNA from 44 selected patients suspected of being genetically predisposed to develop astrocytic tumors was analyzed for germline mutations of the p53, p16, and PTEN genes. Six constitutional missense mutations of the p53 gene were identified (13.6%), but no mutations of the p16 and PTEN genes were found, suggesting that (1) germline p53 mutations contribute to a small portion of astrocytic tumors, (2) inherited mutations of the p16 and PTEN gene do not predispose to the development of gliomas, and (3) other genes are involved in glioma predisposition.

39149100654	Distinctive microRNA profiles relating to patient survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of death from cancer and one of the least studied cancers worldwide. The global microRNA expression profile of esophageal cancer has not been reported previously. Here, for the first time, we have investigated expressed microRNAs in cryopreserved esophageal cancer tissues using advanced microRNA microarray techniques. Our microarray analyses identified seven microRNAs that could distinguish malignant esophageal cancer lesions from adjacent normal tissues. Some microRNAs could be correlated with the different clinicopathologic classifications. High expression of hsa-miR-103/107 correlated with poor survival by univariate analysis as well as by multivariate analysis. These results indicate that microRNA expression profiles are important diagnostic and prognostic markers of esophageal cancer, which might be analyzed simply using economical approaches such as reverse transcription-PCR. ©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.

31844453989	Identification and expression analysis of alternatively spliced isoforms of human interleukin-23 receptor gene in normal lymphoid cells and selected tumor cells	Interleukin 23 (IL-23) is a new member of the IL-12 family that plays a critical role in promoting the proliferation of memory T helper 1 cells. The heterodimerized IL-23 receptor is composed of a shared IL-12 receptor beta 1 (IL-12Rβ1) and an IL-12Rβ2-related molecule called IL-23R. The standard form of IL-23 R is encoded by at least 12 exons. Here, we demonstrate that at least six spliced isoforms of IL-23R (IL-23R1 to 6) can be generated through alternative splicing. The splicing strategies for the IL-23R gene are complicated and most often result in the deletion of exon 7 and/or exon 10. Translation prediction revealed that these spliced variants result in either premature termination to give rise to a diverse form of receptor ectodomain, or a frameshift to generate various lengths of the IL-23R endodomain. Differential expressions of EL-23 R spliced variants are observed in natural killer and CD3

34247500414	Extracellular activity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase as a biomarker for human cancer detection: Distribution characteristics in a normal population and cancer patients	The overexpression of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been reported in patients with cancer, and PKA inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials as a novel cancer therapy. The present study was designed to characterize the population distribution of extracellular activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (ECPKA) and its potential value as a biomarker for cancer detection and monitoring of cancer therapy. The population distribution of ECPKA activity was determined in serum samples from a Chinese population consisting of a total of 603 subjects (374 normal healthy volunteers and 229 cancer patients). The serum ECPKA was determined by a validated sensitive radioassay, and its diagnostic values (including positive and negative predictive values) were analyzed. The majority of normal subjects (>70%) have undetectable or very low levels of serum ECPKA. In contrast, the majority of cancer patients (>85%) have high levels of ECPKA. The mean ECPKA activity in the sera of cancer patients was 10.98 units/mL, 5-fold higher than that of the healthy controls (2.15 units/mL; P < 0.001). In both normal subjects and cancer patients, gender and age had no significant influence on the serum ECPKA. Among factors considered, logistic analysis revealed that the disease (cancer) is the only factor contributing to the elevation of ECPKA activity in cancer patients. In conclusion, ECPKA may function as a cancer marker for various human cancers and can be used in cancer detection and for monitoring response to therapy with other screening or diagnostic techniques.

34249280219	Abdominal cocoon with early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction: One case report and literature review	Objective: To investigate diagnosis and treatment of abdominal cocoon with early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction. Methods: The data of one case of abdominal cocoon with early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction was analyzed and related literatures were reviewed. Results: A 69-year old man was admitted to hospital with paroxysmal colicky abdominal pain, constipated, vomit and without flatus for one day. Exploratory laparotomy revealed abdominal cocoon, which was verified by histological examination. Early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction occurred seven days later and treated conservatively. The patient was recovery after three-month's follow-up. Conclusion: Extensive adhesion appeared after abdominal cocoon operation could lead to early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction. This complication should be treated conservatively. Surgical principles of abdominal cocoon should be handled differently according to different situations and extensive adhesion should be avoided to prevent early postoperative inflammatory small bowel obstruction.

41149150336	Vascular invasion as an independent prognostic indicator in radically resected non-small cell lung cancer	Objective: A retrospective study was performed to analyze the impact of vascular invasion on prognosis in a series of radically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the subgroup of T1-4 nodal negative NSCLC patients. Methods: A total of 259 NSCLC patients who had undergone radical resection were entered into this study. Detailed clinical data including five-year survival were obtained for all the patients. The tumors were reviewed for the presence or absence of vascular invasion. Fisher's exact tests were used to assess the relationship between vascular invasion and other clinicopathological variables. Survival time was defined as the interval from the date of operation to either death from lung cancer or the last follow-up. Univariate analysis of survival curve was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method using the Log rank test. Multivariate survival analysis was carried out by Cox regression. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In 259 patients, 33 cases were diagnosed as having vascular invasion. The overall 5-year survival was 37.5%. Patients with vascular invasion had a median survival of 20 months compared with 43 months for those without vascular invasion (P<0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that vascular invasion was a significant independent prognostic predictor for shortened cancer-related survival in the patients. The relative risk for cancer-related survival was 2.2-fold greater in patients with vascular invasion (95% CI: 1.45-3.32). Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with vascular invasion had a 5-year survival of 11.1% compared with 57.1% for those without vascular invasion in the resected lung cancer patients at T

60549107907	Nucleolar localization of upstream binding factor in HeLa cells depends on rRNA synthesis activities	During Pol I-mediated rRNA synthesis, UBF plays a key role in transcription. Numerous localization studies provided, however, rather divergent results with regard to its presence in either of the two structural nucleolar subcompartments, FC and DFC. These observations suggest different roles of UBF within nucleoli. In order to expand our knowledge in this respect, we have performed the ultrastructural localization of UBF and DNA in HeLa cell nucleoli and complemented it with mapping DNA/RNA hybrids, which testify for the presence of newly synthesized rRNA. With immunogold UBF mapping, the results fell, depending on the type of nucleoli, basically into two categories. In nucleoli exhibiting one, or at most a few, large FC, UBF molecules were mapped mainly into FC. Such nucleoli are known to possess lower activity in rRNA synthesis. In the second category of reticulated nucleoli with many tiny FCs, which are characterized by high rRNA gene transcription, the gold particles were enriched mainly in DFC/FC borders and DFC. The established differential localization of UBF in nucleoli of HeLa cells thus has a functional meaning. It reflects both the level of rRNA synthesis activities and the architectural role of UBF in nucleoli of these cells.

0034922349	Configuration of nucleolar DNA in situ in nucleolus of Allium cepa cells	The location and configuration of nucleolar DNA have not been determined for a long time. In this paper, we have observed the nucleolar ultrastructure and the character of nucleolar DNA in Allium cepa cells by conventional electron microscopy and the cytochemical NAMA-Ur DNA specific staining method. Furthermore, we have properly improved the NAMA-Ur method so as to analyze the location and configuration of nucleolar DNA in situ. Our results indicated that the nucleolar DNA in Allium cepa cells is mainly located at the border between fibrillar centers and dense fibrillar component, especially distributed in the configuration of encircling the fibrillar centers.

79952331586	DNA hypermethylation of microRNA-34b/c has prognostic value for stage I non-small cell lung cancer	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world and approximately 30-40% of patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) die of recurrent disease. miRNA expression profiles can be diagnostic and prognostic markers of lung cancer. Recently, miR-34 family has been shown to be part of the p53 pathway which is frequently involved in lung cancer, and the expression of miR-34 has been reported to be regulated by DNA methylation. In present study, we investigated the correlation between DNA methylation status of miR-34 family and recurrence of stage I NSCLC patients. miR-34a and miR-34b/c promoter methylation status were determined by nested methylation-specific PCR in FFPE tumor tissues from 161 patients of stage I NSCLC. Furthermore, mature miR-34b and miR-34c expression were analyzed by qRT-PCR in the same panel tissues. Our results revealed that aberrant DNA methylation of miR-34b/c was correlated with a high probability of recurrence (p = 0.026) and associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.010) and disease-free survival (p = 0.017). No significant association was found for miR-34a methylation. Multivariate analysis showed that promoter hypermethylation of miR-34b/c was an independent prognostic factor of stage I NSCLC. Moreover, no significant association between mature miR-34b and miR-34c expression and DNA methylation status was found. In conclusion, we have identified promoter hypermethylation of miR-34b/c as a relatively common event in NSCLC and might be a potential prognostic factor for stage I NSCLC. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

84876783526	Lung cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2009	Background: The National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) is a governmental organization for cancer surveillance affiliated to the Bureau of Disease Control, Ministry of Health, in China. It annually collects cancer registration data from local registries and then analyzes and publishes the results to provide useful information for making anti-cancer policy, program evaluation, and etiology research. At the end of 2012, the NCCR reported cancer statistics for 2009. Methods: By mid 2012, 104 population-based cancer registries reported cancer incidence and mortality data, including demographic information, for 2009, to the NCCR. After an evaluation procedure, a total of 72 registries' data met the criteria, which was then compiled for analysis. Individual lung cancer cases were retrieved from the national database based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 topography code as "C33, C34," including cancers of the trachea and bronchus. The crude incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer were calculated by gender, age, and location (urban/rural). China's population in 1982 and Segi's population structures were used for age-standardized rates. Results: In cancer registration areas in 2009, lung cancer was the most common cancer in China and in urban areas, the second most common cancer in rural areas. It was the leading cause of cancer death both in males and females, urban and rural areas. The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer were higher in males than those in females, and in urban areas than in rural areas. The age-specific incidence and mortality rates showed that both rates were relatively low for those aged under 50 years, but dramatically increased and reached a peak in the age group of 80-84 years. Conclusion: Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China and leading cause of cancer death. Primary and secondary prevention should be carried out in each group, such as tobacco control and early detection. © 2012 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

42049088489	Increased expression of paxillin is found in human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: A tissue microarray study	Oesophageal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Currently, the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is the primary method for determining its extent and prognosis, however, data suggest this system does not predict prognosis accurately. Research has, therefore, concentrated on searching for specific biomarkers. Paxillin has been shown to play an important role in controlling cell spread and migration. Its over-expression is considered to correlate with the prognosis of some types of cancers, however, the relationship between paxillin expression and clinical outcome in oesophageal cancer has not been investigated. This study determined the expression of paxillin by immunohistochemistry on the tissue microarray of 100 oesophageal squamous cell cancer patients followed up for a mean of 55 months. Paxillin was over-expressed in tumours in 27/100 cases, compared with 6/ 100 cases for adjacent non-tumoural cells. No correlation occurred between expression of paxillin and overall patient survival, hence paxillin is not an effective prognostic marker in these patients.

Methods: The clinical data of 22 patients with primary soft tissue sarcoma of mediastinum, 12 males and 10 females, aged 46 (28-69), hospitalized over 27 years were retrospectively reviewed, focusing on the clinical presentations, preoperative diagnosis, imaging features, immunohistochemical studies, treatment, and survival. Results: Chest pain, dyspnea, cough, and shoulder pain were the most common complaints. Imaging findings showed large lobulated mass. The overall 5-year survival rate was 62.8%. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with tumors larger than 10 cm was 65.6%, significantly higher than that of the patients with tumors smaller than 10 cm (38.8%, P = 0.019). The long-term survival rate of the patients who received complete resection was 84 months, longer, though not significantly, than that of the patients who received incomplete resection (8 months, P = 0.059). The 5-year survival rate of the patients with lesions at high grade and stage III were 38.2% and 38.2% respectively, both lower, though not significantly, than those of lesions at low grade and stage I (60% and 60% respectively, both P = 0.317). The 5-year survival rate of the patients who received surgery only was 8 months, shorter, though not significantly, than that of the patients who received surgery plus adjuvant therapy (12 months, P = 0.204). Conclusion: Tumor size and character of resection are important prognostic factors for primary soft tissue sarcoma of mediastinum.

44449160394	Suppression of PPN/MG61 attenuates Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in human lung cancer	Wingless and int homologue (Wnt) family proteins have been shown to have important roles in the decision of cell fate and behavior at multiple stages during the development and tumorigenesis. One of the Drosophila segment polarity genes, porcupine (porc) gene, encodes an evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein involving in the post-translational processing of the Wnt family proteins. Here, we report that human homologue of Drosophila porc gene, PPN/MG61, was abundantly expressed in human cancer cell lines, but not in normal cells. We also found that PPN/MG61 was overexpressed in primary lung cancer tissue samples, compared to their matched normal tissue samples. Furthermore, when we used small interfering RNA to knock down PPN/MG61 mRNA in lung cancer cells expressing the gene, we observed apoptosis induction, along with decreased activity of Wnt pathway in those lung cancer cells. These data suggest that PPN/MG61 may be a novel marker for human lung cancer and that post-translational modification of the Wnt signal molecules by PPN/MG61 may be important for the function of Wnt pathway in lung cancer. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

44149111596	In situ comparative studies on subnucleolar distribution and configuration of plant rDNA	The distribution and configurations of nucleolar DNA in Pisum sativum L., Allium sativum L., Triticum aestivum L. were analyzed by specific cytochemical staining using NAMA-Ur. It has been observed that in the nucleoli of different plant species, the DNA occupied different positions in different areas, which may imply a different status and strategy of rDNA transcription. Our results showed irregular clumps of rDNA surrounding FCs in semi-circular formations in P. sativum and T. aestivum, indicating a regular pattern of rDNA distribution and supporting the helix model of rDNA configuration. The rDNA was condensed in some regions and uncondensed in others. Nucleolus-associated chromatin extended from outside the nucleolus to the periphery of the FCs via nucleolar channels, which suggests a possible origin for nucleolar DNA. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

45749105984	Inhibition of ERK and activation of p38 are involved in diallyl disulfide induced apoptosis of leukemia HL-60 cells	We investigated the effects of diallyl disulfide (DADS) on the induction of apoptosis in human Leukemia cell line HL-60 and explored the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK and p38 MAPK) pathways in the growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by DADS. MTT assay was used to determine the DADS induced cell growth inhibition in HL-60 cells. Flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation were used to examine the roles of apoptosis in DADS-mediated cell death. Western blot analysis of the expression of phospho-MAPKs (ERK and p38) was employed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of DADS induced apoptosis. We found that growth inhibition of HL-60 cells treated with DADS exhibited a dose-dependent response (P<0.05) and DADS induced significant apoptosis. DADS at the concentration of 10 mg/L persistently activated p38 and simultaneously reduced ERK activity. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK upstream activators MAPK kinase MKK1 and MKK2, promoted cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells treated with DADS. In contrast, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, decreased cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by DADS. Therefore, DADS can effectively inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of human leukemia cell line HL-60. Inhibition of ERK signaling pathways and activation of p38 signaling pathways are likely involved in DADS induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. © 2008 The Pharmaceutical Society of Korea.

48549093715	Effects of altered gravity on the cell cycle, actin cytoskeleton and proteome in Physarum polycephalum	Some researchers suggest that the changes of cell cycle under the effect of microgravity may be associated with many serious adverse physiological changes. In the search for underlying mechanisms and possible new countermeasures, we used the slime mold Physarum polycephalum in which all the nuclei traverse the cell cycle in natural synchrony to study the effects of altered gravity on the cell cycle, actin cytoskeleton and proteome. In parallel, the cell cycle was analyzed in Physarum incubated (1) in altered gravity for 20 h, (2) in altered gravity for 40 h, (3) in altered gravity for 80 h, and (4) in ground controls. The cell cycle, the actin cytoskeleton, and proteome in the altered gravity and ground controls were examined. The results indicated that the duration of the G2 phase was lengthened 20 min in high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) for 20 h, and prolonged 2 h in altered gravity either for 40 h or for 80 h, whereas the duration of other phases in the cell cycle was unchanged with respect to the control. The microfilaments in G2 phase had a reduced number of fibers and a unique abnormal morphology in altered gravity for 40 h, whereas the microfilaments in other phases of cell cycle were unchanged when compared to controls. Employing classical two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE), we examined the effect of the altered gravity on P. polycephalum proteins. The increase in the duration of G2 phase in altered gravity for 40 h was accompanied by changes in the 2-DE protein profiles, over controls. Out of a total of 200 protein spots investigated in G2 phase, which were reproducible in repeated experiments, 72 protein spots were visually identified as specially expressed, and 11 proteins were up-regulated by 2-fold and 28 proteins were down-regulated by 2-fold over controls. Out of a total of three low-expressed proteins in G2 phase in altered gravity for 40 h, two proteins were unknown proteins, and one protein was spherulin 3b by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). Our results suggest that a low level of spherulin 3b in G2 phase, which may lead to a reduction of Poly(b-L-malate) (PMLA), may contribute to the lengthened duration of G2 phase in altered gravity for 40 h. Present results indicate that altered gravity results in the prolongation of G2 phase with significantly altered actin cytoskeleton and proteome in P. polycephalum. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

61449361090	Primary small cell carcinoma of the esophagus	Introduction: Primary small cell esophageal carcinoma (SCEC) is a rare and aggressive disease for which there is no recommended standard treatment at this time. Methods: A total of 126 patients with SCEC, diagnosed histologically between May 1985 and June 2005 at our institution, were analyzed retrospectively. All were staged according to the Veterans' Administration Lung Study Group staging system. The TNM system for esophageal carcinoma (6th edition, American Joint Committee on Cancer) was also used for those who underwent esophagectomies. SPSS (10.0) software was used for statistical analysis. Cox's hazard regression model was performed to identify prognostic factors. The Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods were used to estimate and compare survival rates. The χ test was performed to examine frequencies between different groups. Results: Through a median follow-up of 13 months, 108 patients died, 10 were alive, and 8 were lost to follow-up. Of the entire study population, the overall median survival time (MST) and 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 12.5 months and 52.2%, 15.9%, and 12.2%, respectively. For limited disease, the MST and 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 14.0 months and 62.1%, 30.8%, and 22.4%, respectively; for extensive disease, the respective values were 7.0 months and 29.3%, 13.6%, and 2.7% (p = 0.0001). The MST of 14.5 months for cases who received chemotherapy was superior to that of 5.2 months for cases who did not (p = 0.0001). Tumor stage, length of the primary lesion, and chemotherapy, but not surgery were independent prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis. Conclusions: SCEC is systemic disease. Tumor stage and chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors. Systemic therapy, based on chemotherapy with radiotherapy, is recommended. © 2008 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

62149121635	Association between sputum atypia and lung cancer risk in an occupational cohort in Yunnan, China	Background: Individuals with cytologic atypia in sputum may be at high risk for the development of lung cancer. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted among occupational tin miners in Yunnan China based on an annual lung cancer screening program. Sputum samples were collected prospectively at baseline and the following seven annual screenings. The associations between risk factors and sputum cytology were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A proportional hazard model was used to analyze the association between the baseline sputum results and the incidence of lung cancer. The effect of consecutive sputum cytology on the increase of lung cancer risk was analyzed by logistic regression. Results: Sputum cytologic atypia was associated with age, smoking, occupational radon and arsenic exposure, and asthma. Sputum cytologic atypia was an independent risk factor for lung cancer with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.82 to 5.18) in comparing normal to moderate or worse atypia. Compared to the lung cancer risk associated with normal sputum, the risk was significantly higher according to the degree of atypia for squamous carcinomas, small cell lung cancer and central lung cancer, with adjusted HRs of 5.70 (95% CI, 3.78 to 8.59), 3.32 (95% CI, 1.31 to 8.45), and 4.93 (95% CI, 3.51 to 6.92), respectively. Conclusions: Sputum atypia is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Sputum cytologic examination combined with other screening examinations may play an important role in the early detection of lung cancer or in the selection of the optimal target population for more intensive lung cancer screening among this occupational cohort or similar population.

64549138422	Automics: An integrated platform for NMR-based metabonomics spectral processing and data analysis	Background: Spectral processing and post-experimental data analysis are the major tasks in NMR-based metabonomics studies. While there are commercial and free licensed software tools available to assist these tasks, researchers usually have to use multiple software packages for their studies because software packages generally focus on specific tasks. It would be beneficial to have a highly integrated platform, in which these tasks can be completed within one package. Moreover, with open source architecture, newly proposed algorithms or methods for spectral processing and data analysis can be implemented much more easily and accessed freely by the public. Results: In this paper, we report an open source software tool, Automics, which is specifically designed for NMR-based metabonomics studies. Automics is a highly integrated platform that provides functions covering almost all the stages of NMR-based metabonomics studies. Automics provides high throughput automatic modules with most recently proposed algorithms and powerful manual modules for 1D NMR spectral processing. In addition to spectral processing functions, powerful features for data organization, data pre-processing, and data analysis have been implemented. Nine statistical methods can be applied to analyses including: feature selection (Fisher's criterion), data reduction (PCA, LDA, ULDA), unsupervised clustering (K-Mean) and supervised regression and classification (PLS/PLS-DA, KNN, SIMCA, SVM). Moreover, Automics has a user-friendly graphical interface for visualizing NMR spectra and data analysis results. The functional ability of Automics is demonstrated with an analysis of a type 2 diabetes metabolic profile. Conclusion: Automics facilitates high throughput 1D NMR spectral processing and high dimensional data analysis for NMR-based metabonomics applications. Using Automics, users can complete spectral processing and data analysis within one software package in most cases. Moreover, with its open source architecture, interested researchers can further develop and extend this software based on the existing infrastructure. © 2009 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

67649408809	Identification and characterization of MARVELD1, a novel nuclear protein that is down-regulated in multiple cancers and silenced by DNA methylation	MARVELD1 (MARVEL domain-containing 1) is a member of MARVEL domain-containing proteins and located on human chromosome 10q24.2. MARVELD1 has no significant similarity with other members of MARVEL domain family at amino acid level. Gene expression arrays demonstrated that MARVELD1 is widely expressed in normal human tissues and is down-regulated in primary multiple tumors derived from ovary, vulva, uterus, cervix, breast, testis, kidney, bladder and liver. The down-regulation of MARVELD1 was further identified by real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining in primary breast cancer. In addition, we identified the reduced expression of MARVELD1 is owing to DNA methylation and could be reversed by pharmacologic demethylation. Finally, our results showed that MARVELD1 protein is located in nucleus instead of cell membrane. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

67649950283	FAK Phosphorylation by ERK Primes Ras-Induced Tyrosine Dephosphorylation of FAK Mediated by PIN1 and PTP-PEST	Activated Ras has been found in many types of cancer. However, the mechanism underlying Ras-promoted tumor metastasis remains unclear. We demonstrate here that activated Ras induces tyrosine dephosphorylation and inhibition of FAK mediated by the Ras downstream Fgd1-Cdc42-PAK1-MEK-ERK signaling cascade. ERK phosphorylates FAK S910 and recruits PIN1 and PTP-PEST, which colocalize with FAK at the lamellipodia of migrating cells. PIN1 binding and prolyl isomerization of FAK cause PTP-PEST to interact with and dephosphorylate FAK Y397. Inhibition of FAK mediated by this signal relay promotes Ras-induced cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These findings uncover the importance of sequential modification of FAK-by serine phosphorylation, isomerization, and tyrosine dephosphorylation-in the regulation of FAK activity and, thereby, in Ras-related tumor metastasis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

According to VALSG criteria, 138 patients had limited disease (LD), 13 had extensive disease (ED). Patients received surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test using SPSS 13.0 software. Results: The 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60-month survival rates of these patients were 86.6%, 56.7%, 24.8%, 17.4% and 12.0%, respectively. The clinical stage and blood vessel invasion were independent prognostic factors of PESC. The median survival time of LD patients was longer in those undergoing combined therapy (12.3 months) than in those undergoing local treatment alone (surgery or radiotherapy). Conclusions: PESC is a malignant tumor with early metastasis and poor prognosis. Combined therapy based on chemotherapy may improve the short term survival of PESC patients. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.

70349298380	Cloning and characterization of a novel intracellular protein p48.2 that negatively regulates cell cycle progression	Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) microdeletion is a large genomic deletion that embraces at least 11 continuous genes at human chromosome 17q11.2. To date, most of these genes' functions still remain undefined. In this study, we report an unknown cytokine receptor like molecule (p48.2) that is frequently deleted in patients with type-1 and type-2 NF1 microdeletions in the neurofibromin locus. The cloned gene has 1317 base pair long that encodes a 438aa intracellular protein. The gene was subsequently named p48.2 based on its predicted molecular weight. A typical fibronectin type III (FNIII) domain was identified in p48.2 between Arg

70350599685	Genomic and proteomic analysis of soybean heritable variations induced by space flight	To analyze the biological effects of space environment, the diversity of genomic DNA between the space flight soybean 194(4126) with phenotype of good yield and good fruit quality induced by space flight and the soybean with ground control was studied by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method, and the polymorphism of space flight soybean 194(4126) was 3.56%. The differences of protein expression of seeds and leaves between the two kinds of soybeans were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, PDQuest software and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Results show that the loss and decrease of protein expression in 194(4126) soybean are subjected to the space fight of seeds, and three special proteins including Dehydrin, MAT1 and ceQORH are identified. It is concluded that the space environment changes the phenotype and genotype of soybeans due to the space flight of seeds.

75749088527	Pin1 expression contributes to lung cancer Prognosis and carcinogenesis	Lung cancer remains the most common cause of death for malignancy in both men and women. Current therapies for NSCLC patients are inefficient due to the lack of diagnostic and therapeutic markers. The phospho-Ser/Thr-Pro specific prolyl-isomerase Pin1 is overexpressed in many different cancers, including NsCLC, and may possibly be used as a target for cancer therapy. We identified 79 cases with the follow-up survival and investigated the clinical relevance of Pin1 expression in NsCLC patients. To validate the oncogenic potential of Pin1 in lung cells, we overexpressed Pin1 in Glc82 cells, and downregulated Pin1 by RNA interference in H1299 cells. The 5-year survival rate of the 79 patients was 54.6%. High expression of Pin1 correlated with poor survival by univariate analysis as well as by multivariate analysis, demonstrating that high expression of Pin1 was an independent prognostic factor. Consistent with the clinical findings, overexpression of Pin1 in Glc82 cells increased cell growth and colony formation and tumorigenicity in nude mice including cell migration, invasion. To further validate the role of Pin1 in lung cancer carcinogenesis, lentivirus-mediated siRNa targeting of Pin1 resulted in the stable suppression of both cell growth, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and tumorigenic including cell migration, invasion in h1299 cells. Pin1 expression may be an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients of NsCLC patients, and these results indicate that Pin1 may have a role in tumor development and metastasis and thus could serve as a novel target for treatment of NSCLC. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

77949644637	RPL41, a small ribosomal peptide deregulated in tumors, is essential for mitosis and centrosome integrity	Ribosomal large subunit protein RPL41 is a basic (positively charged) peptide consisting of only 25 amino acids. An antisense-based functional screening revealed that the down-regulation of RPL41 led to an anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells in soft agar plates. RPL41 depletion with gene-specific small interfering RNA also resulted in malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells including increased tumor growth in mice. RPL41 deletion was detected in 59% of tumor cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses and RPL41 down-regulation in 75% of primary breast cancers by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These studies suggest a tumor suppression role for RPL41. By mass spectrometry, RPL41 was associated with several cytoskeleton components including tubulin â, ã, and myosin IIA, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis on both cellular lysis and individually in vitro-expressed proteins. RPL41 also bound directly to polymerized tubulins. Cells overexpressing a GFP-RPL41 were resistant to nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization. A synthetic RPL41 induced cellular á-tubulin acetylation and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These results indicate a stabilizing role of RPL41 on microtubule. Microtubule spindles are essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Cells with RPL41 knock-downshowed abnormal spindles, frequent failure of cytokinesis, and formation of polynuclear cells. In interphase cells, RPL41-depleted cells had premature splitting of centrosome. Our results provide evidence thatRPL41 is amicrotubule-associated protein essential for functional spindles and for the integrity of centrosome and that the abnormal mitosis and disrupted centrosome associated with the RPL41 down-regulation may be related to malignant transformation.

77950057242	The kappa-opioid receptor is upregulated in the spinal cord and locus ceruleus but downregulated in the dorsal root ganglia of morphine tolerant rats	As a non-selective agonist of opioid receptors, morphine can also act on the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) when activating the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Although previous findings indicate that KOR plays an important role in morphine analgesia and antinociceptive tolerance, the reasons for the paradoxical functions of KOR in analgesia and anti-analgesia responses are still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the KOR in morphine analgesia and antinociceptive tolerance. As such, the changes in KOR expression in different regions of the nervous system in morphine tolerant rats were examined. We were able to attain morphine tolerance in rats via subcutaneous injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) twice daily for 7-consecutive days. Competitive real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analyses were used to assess KOR expression in related regions of the nervous system, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, locus ceruleus (LC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), lumber-sacral spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The expression of KOR increased in the locus ceruleus and spinal cord, but was significantly decreased in the DRG of morphine tolerant rats (P < 0.05). No other significant changes in KOR expression were observed in the other regions. Consequently, we propose that the locus ceruleus and spinal cord are likely the dominant CNS regions and the DRG is the main peripheral site in which chronic morphine exerts its effect on KOR. Prolonged morphine administration induces inconsistent changes of KOR in the central and peripheral nervous system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77950663047	The prevalence of epstein-barr virus infection in different types and sites of lymphomas	To analyze the association of several types of malignant lymphomas in different anatomical sites with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection status, 127 cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of malignant lymphomas were investigated with in situ hybridization detecting EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) in tumor cells. Forty-six out of 108 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases were positive for EBER (42.6%). The EBER-positivity rate of NHL in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx (35/60 cases, 58.3%) was higher than that of NHL in stomach (9/30 cases, 30%) and in the superficial lymph nodes (2/18 cases, 11.1%) (P < 0.05). The EBER-positivity rate of Hodgkin lymphoma in the superficial lymph nodes was 26.3% (5/19 cases). These findings suggest that the EBV-positivity rate in lymphomas is related to their histological types and locations.

77951577545	hSHIP induces S-phase arrest and growth inhibition in cervical cancer HeLa cells	hSHIP, a human SH2-containing inositol-5-phosphatase, acts as a negative regulator of proliferation and survival in hematopoietic cells. Therefore, hSHIP may play a crucial role in suppression of cervical cancer HeLa cells. In this study, pcDNA3.1-hSHIP-GFP plasmid was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells with Lipofectamine2000, stably transfected HeLa cells were established and their responses were investigated by Flow cytometry, MTT, tumorigenicity in nude mice, RT-PCR and ELISA assays. The results showed that the expression of hSHIP significantly induced S-phase arrest, cell growth inhibition, and down-regulation of Akt1/2 mRNA and p-Akt in HeLa cells. Our study supports an important role for hSHIP in suppression of cervical cancer HeLa cells, which may prove to be a novel therapeutic option for non-hematopoietic cancers. © 2010 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

77952040467	Interference of chk1/2 by RNA regulates G2/M arrest and expressions of cell cycle related proteins induced by diallyl disulfide	Chk1 and Chk2 play major role in cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathway, which are mainly involved in G2/M cell cycle checkpoint signal transduction. Firstly, the siRNA targeting at Chk1 or Chk2 gene was transfected into human gastric cancer BGC823 cells for 24 h before 15 mg/L DADS was added. Then, the mRNA and protein expression of Chk1 or Chk2 was detected by Real-time PCR and Western-blot respectively. Cell cycle rates and expressions of CDC25C and cyclinB1 were determined by FCM and Western blot respectively. The results showed that the Chk1 or Chk2 expression was inhibited in Chk1 or Chk2 siRNA-transfected group, in which the Chk1 or Chk2 expression at mRNA level was reduced 84.7% and 69.0% respectively and the protein expression of Chk1 or Chk2 was reduced 73.4% and 78.5% respectively as compared with that in empty control group (P < 0.05). Then it was investigated whether Chk1 and Chk2 proteins could influence cell cycle regulation by knocking down their expressions in BGC823 cells. Further investigation revealed that inhibition of the Chk1 expression in Chk1 siRNA transfected group cut down the proportion of the cells in G2/M phase from 58.1% to 10.4% in BGC823 cells after 24 h induced by DADS (P < 0.05). While inhibition of the Chk2 expression in Chk2 siRNA transfected group had little effect on G2/M arrest after treatment with DADS (P > 0.05). Western blot showed that although DADS decreased expression of CDC25C and cyclinB1 in untransfected cells, inhibition of expression of CDC25C and cyclinB1 treated by DADS was blocked by Chk1 gene silence (P < 0.05). On the contrary, Chk2 gene silence can not do so. These results suggest Chk1 gene silence could abrogate G2/M arrest induced by DADS in BGC823 cell line, and Chk1/CDC25C/cyclinB1 pathway was involved at the G2/M arrest induced by DADS.

77953535808	Serological thymidine kinase 1 is a prognostic factor in oesophageal, cardial and lung carcinomas	In this study we examine the use of the concentration of thymidine kinase 1 in serum (STK1) as a prognostic factor in routine clinical settings. For this purpose we used sera from patients with oesophageal (n=101) and cardial (n=39) carcinomas and nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (n=157). Sera from healthy individuals (n=95) were used as controls. STK1 was analysed by a chemiluminiscence dot blot assay. The mean STK1 concentrations and the STK1 positive rates of the patients with oesophageal and cardial carcinomas and with NSCLC were significantly higher as compared with healthy controls (P=0.01). The mean STK1 value of oesophageal carcinoma patients correlated with T-values (P=0.021) and with stage (P<0.005), but not with grade. The mean STK1 value of cardial carcinoma patients did not correlate with grade. No data on stage and T-values were available for these patients, due to advanced disease. The mean STK1 value of NSCLC patients with squamous cell carcinoma was significantly higher as compared with adenocarcinoma type (P=0.024). The mean STK1 value of the NSCLC patients correlated with clinical grade (P=0.006), T-values (P=0.001), stage (P=0.035) and to size of the tumour (P=0.030). The mean STK1 value and the number of STK1 positive patients were also higher in recurrent NSCLC patients. There was a tendency that stage I-II NSCLC patients with an STK1 level above 2 pmol/l showed a higher frequency of recurrence/death than patients below 1 pmol/l. Our results show that STK1 is a useful marker for prognosis in patients with oesophageal, cardial and lung carcinomas. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77953765126	Transient increase in serum thymidine kinase 1 within one week after surgery of patients with carcinoma	Aim: To investigate transient increases of thymidine kinase 1 in serum (STK1) after surgery of patients with carcinoma. Patients and Methods: STK1 was determined before and within one week after surgery of carcinoma patients (non-small cell lung (NSCLC), n=25, oesophagueal, n=12, cardial, n=4,) by a chemiluminescent dot blot assay using anti-TK1 IgY antibody. Results: The mean age of the patients with high STK1 values after surgery was 632±8.7 years, while that for patients with stable/low STK1 values was 54.8±11.8 years; this was significantly different at P<0.05. Sixty-one percent of the patients with high STK1 values after surgery exhibited declining red blood cell (35%) or increasing white blood celllneutrophil cell (29%) counts. The high STK1 values after surgery correlated with a prolonged operation execution time in anaemic patients (3.43±0.90 h), as compared non-anaemic patients (2.72±0.79 h). The high STK1 values also correlated with extensive surgery programs (oseophageal/ cardial carcinoma, 3.31±0.70 h, versus NSCLC, 2.44±0.63 h). Conclusion: The transiently elevated STK1 values post-operation might be due to surgery-induced complications, such as anaemia and infection/inflammation, but also to operation execution times and age of patients. We suggest that STK1 should not be used within one week post-operation, but before surgery and after one month to avoid non-tumor-related increases in STK1, and thus misleading results.

METHODS: The records of 160 patients undergoing complete resection for lung adenocarcinoma were reviewed to collect datas. The expression levels and associativity with clinicopathologic characteristics of p190-B RhoGAP were analyzed using immunohistochemistry method. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate its expression with clinical characteristics and prognosis. RESULTS: p190-B RhoG-AP was shown to be over expressed in 43.75%(70/160) lung adenocarcinoma samples (P = 0.003), and mainly located in cytoplasm. The expression of p190-B RhoGAP was significantly correlated with the stage of clinicopathology (P = 0.018), histologic differentiation (P = 0.047), and prognosis (P = 0.015); it is a self-sustainingly prognosis factor. Compared with low expressed ones, the patiens with increased p190-B RhoGAP expression was associated with poor survival of lung adenocarcinoma (5-year survival rate, 45.7% vs 23.5%). CONCLUSION: p190-B RhoGAP may be a valuable tumor marker for lung adenocarcinoma.

77954975777	Gene analysis of Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphomas in Hu-PBL/SCID chimeras	Aims and background. The mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor development are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression of EBV-associated lymphomas in hu-PBL/SCID mice. Methods. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hu-PBL) from EBV-seropositive donors were transplanted into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. In situ hybridization was used to detect EBV-encoded small RNA-1 (EBER1) in tumor tissues. Mutation of TP53 exons 5-8 in EBV-induced lymphomas was analyzed by PCR-SSCP. Immunohistochemical staining was used to examine EBV gene products and cellular oncoproteins. Results. Twenty-one of 29 mice developed tumors. EBER1 was positive in the nuclei of almost all tumor cells. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining of LMP1, EBNA2 and ZEBRA in a small number of tumor cells. Immunohistochemically detectable p53 protein expression was common (85.7%), but TP53 gene mutations were identified in only four cases (19.1%) of EBV-associated lymphomas. Positivity rates of C-myc, Bcl-2 and Bax expression were 100%, 95.2%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the 21 cases of EBV-associated lymphomas. Conclusions. Our preliminary findings suggest that EBV-associated lymphomas in hu-PBL/SCID chimeras show EBV infection, expression of oncogenic viral genes, and overexpression of cellular oncogenes. TP53 gene mutations are rare but p53 protein is commonly expressed in EBV-associated lymphomas.

78149425347	Role of adjuvant radiotherapy for stage II thymoma after complete tumor resection	Purpose: To determine whether patients with Masaoka stage II thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy after complete tumor resection. Methods and Materials: A total of 107 patients with stage II thymoma who underwent complete resection of their tumors between September 1964 and October 2006 were retrospectively analyzed. Sixty-six patients were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, and 41 patients received surgery alone. Results: Eight patients (7.5%) had a relapse of their disease, including two patients (4.5%) who had surgery alone, and 6 patients (9.5%) who had adjuvant radiation therapy. Disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 92.3% and 82.6%, respectively, for the surgery-plus-radiation group, and 97.6% and 93.1%, respectively, for the group that underwent surgery alone (p = 0.265). Disease-specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 96.4% and 89.3%, respectively, for the surgery-plus-radiation group and 97.5% and 97.5% for the surgery group (p = 0.973). On univariate analysis, patients with type B3 thymomas had the lowest disease-free survival rates among all subtypes (p = 0.001), and patients with large thymomas (>7 cm) had lower disease-specific survival rates than those with small tumors (<7 cm) (p = 0.017). On multivariate analysis, histological type (type B3) thymoma was a significant independent prognostic factor. Conclusions: Adjuvant radiotherapy after complete tumor resection for patients with stage II thymoma did not significantly reduce recurrence rates or improve survival rates. Histological type (type B3) thymoma was a significant independent prognostic factor. Further investigation should be carried out using a multicenter randomized or controlled study. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78649294346	Cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the evaluation of high risk patients with lung cancer	Background It is still unclear whether pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are sufficient for predicting perioperative risk, and whether all patients or only a subset of them need a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) for further assessment. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the CPET and compare the results of CPET and conventional PFTs to identify which parameters are more reliable and valuable in predicting perioperative risks for high risk patients with lung cancer. Methods From January 2005 to August 2008, 297 consecutive lung cancer patients underwent conventional PFTs (spirometry + single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of the lungs (DLCOsb) for diffusion capacity) and CPET preoperatively. The correlation of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications with the parameters of PFT and CPET was retrospectively analyzed using the chi-square test, independent sample t test and binary Logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 297 patients, 78 did not receive operation due to advanced disease stage or poor cardiopulmonary function. The remaining 219 underwent different modes of operations. Twenty-one cases were excluded from this study due to exploration alone (15 cases) and operation-related complications (6 cases). Thus, 198 cases were eligible for evaluation. Fifty of the 198 patients (25.2%) had postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. Three patients (1.5%) died of complications within 30 postoperative days. The patients were stratified into groups based on VO2max/pred (≥70.0%, <70.0%); VO2max·kg-1·min-1 (≥20.0 ml, 15.0-19.9 ml, <15.0 ml) and FEV1 (≥2.0 L, 1.2-1.99 L, <1.2 L), respectively. The rate of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications was significantly higher in the group with VO2max/pred<70.0% or VO2max·kg-1·min-1 <15.0 ml or FEV1<1.2 L than that in the group with VO2max/pred≥70.0% or VO2max·kg-1·min-1 ≥15.0 ml or FEV1≥1.2 L, respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that postoperative cardiopulmonary complications were significantly correlated with age, comorbidities, and poor PFT and CPET results. Conclusions FEV1 in spirometry, VO2max·kg-1·min-1 and VO2max/pred in cardiopulmonary exercise tests can all be used to stratify the patients' cardiopulmonary function status and to predict the risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications for the high risk patients with lung cancer. FEV1 and VO2max·kg-1·min-1 are better than VO2max/pred in predicting perioperative risk. If available, cardiopulmonary exercise testing is strongly suggested for high-risk lung cancer patients in addition to conventional pulmonary function tests, and both should be combined to assess cardiopulmonary function status.

Methods: All the English and Chinese literatures for differential diagnosis of SCLC by serum ProGRP and NSE were collected. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio were pooled using random-effect model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of serum ProGRP and NSE. Results: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 2 536 cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio and diagnostic odds ratio of ProGRP in the diagnosis of SCLC were 0.70, 0.93, 11.57, 0.32 and 36.45, and as for NSE those were 0.61, 0.90, 5.67, 0.45 and 13.08, respectively. The Q* value of ProGRP and NSE were 0.804 2 and 0.723 2. There was no statistical significance between the two. Conclusion: Comparing with NSE, ProGRP has higher specificity and similar discrimination ability, so ProGRP might be a better index in the diagnosis of SCLC.

78651340986	Sudden unexpected death due to inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor of the heart: A case report and review of the literature	Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) or inflammatory pseudotumor is a rare primary cardiac tumor that may result in sudden death. We report a sudden unexpected death due to occlusion of the coronary arteries by IMT arising from the left coronary cusp of the aortic valve. An 8-year-old child suddenly woke up from his sleep with complaint of severe chest pain to his parents, and shortly he became unresponsive. He expired 40 min later in the hospital despite resuscitation efforts. The postmortem examination revealed a 2.5∈×∈2∈×∈1-cm mass composed of multiple entangled slender cylindrical fronts, filling the coronary sinus and obstructing the coronary ostia. The patient had complained of recurrent chest pains about 2 weeks prior to his death. Echocardiogram was conducted on the patient but did not recognize the mass. Histological examination of the mass established the diagnosis of primary cardiac IMT. The detailed pathological findings are described. In addition, the literature is reviewed, and pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and the importance of forensic autopsy examination are discussed. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79953793333	Prior lung disease and lung cancer risk in an occupational-based cohort in Yunnan, China	We used the data from a prospective cohort study among tin miners in Yunnan, China to investigate whether prior lung disease is a risk factor for lung cancer. Information on prior lung disease was obtained from baseline questionnaires. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine the relationship between prior lung disease and lung cancer risk. From 1992 to 2001, a total of 502 lung cancer cases were confirmed among 9295 cohort participants. Prior chronic bronchitis was associated with an increase in lung cancer risk with an adjusted HR of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.24-1.81). There was an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma in the setting of prior chronic bronchitis and small cell carcinoma in association with asthma with an adjusted HRs of 1.57 (95% CI: 1.19-2.09) and 2.56 (95% CI: 1.38-4.75), respectively. This prospective study provides further evidence that prior chronic bronchitis correlates with increased lung cancer risk, especially for squamous cell carcinoma. Asthma is associated with increased risk of small cell lung carcinoma. © 2011.

79953187233	microRNA-92a promotes lymph node metastasis of human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via E-cadherin	microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and play important roles in tumor initiation and progression. Recently, we examined the global miRNA expression profile of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and demonstrated that miR-92a was highly expressed in tumor tissues. In this study, we found that the upregulation of miR-92a was significantly correlated with the status of lymph node metastasis and TNM stage in 107 ESCC patients. Moreover, the up-regulation of miR-92a was associated with poor survival of ESCC patients and might be used as an independent prognostic factor. Next, we investigated the role and mechanism of miR-92a in ESCC cells, and found that miR-92a modulated the migration and invasion but not apoptosis and proliferation of ESCC cells in vitro. We further demonstrated that miR-92a directly targeted the CDH1 3′-UTR and repressed the expression of CDH1, a tumor metastasis suppressor. In addition, restoring of miR-92a-resistant CDH1 expression in miR-92a-overexpression cells recovered the pro-metastasis activity of miR-92a. Taken together, we demonstrated that miR-92a promotes ESCC cell migration and invasion at least partially via suppression of CDH1 expression, and patients with up-regulated miR-92a are prone to lymph node metastasis and thus have poor prognosis. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79954465036	Expression and unique functions of four nuclear factor of activated T cells isoforms in non-small cell lung cancer	Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is an important family of transcription factors that can be activated by calmodulin and calcineurin in human cells. To investigate the expression and clinical significance of NFAT isoforms and calcineurin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we collected tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 159 NSCLC patients and assembled them in a tissue microarray. Protein levels of NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3, NFAT4, and calcineurin were determined using immunohistochemistry. Correlations between NFAT and calcineurin expression and clinicopathologic characteristics were analyzed. We found that the positive rates of NFAT1 (52.8%, 84/159), NFAT2 (11.3%, 18/159), NFAT3 (28.3%, 45/ 159), NFAT4 (47.2%, 75/159), and calcineurin (47.8%, 76/159) expression were significantly higher in tumor tissues than in adjacent normal lung tissues (P < 0.001), respectively. The positive rate of NFAT1 expression was significantly higher in patients with adenocarcinoma (63.5%, 47/74) than in those with squamous cell carcinoma (43.5%, 37/85) (x

79955438869	Sall4, a stem cell factor, affects the side population by regulation of the atp-binding cassette drug transport genes	Our previous work shows that the stem cell factor SALL4 plays a central role in embryonic and leukemic stem cells. In this study, we report that SALL4 expression was higher in drug resistant primary acute myeloid leukemic patients than those from drug-responsive cases. In addition, while overexpression of SALL4 led to drug resistance in cell lines, cells with decreased SALL4 expression were more sensitive to drug treatments than the parental cells. This led to our investigation of the implication of SALL4 in drug resistance and its role in side population (SP) cancer stem cells. SALL4 expression was higher in SP cells compared to non-SP cells by 2-4 fold in various malignant hematopoietic cell lines. Knocking down of SALL4 in isolated SP cells resulted in a reduction of SP cells, indicating that SALL4 is required for their self-renewal. The SP phenotype is known to be mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug transport protein family, such as ABCG2 and ABCA3. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay(EMSA), we demonstrated that SALL4 was able to bind to the promoter region of ABCA3 and activate its expression while regulating the expression of ABCG2 indirectly. Furthermore, SALL4 expression was positively correlated to those of ABCG2 and ABCA3 in primary leukemic patient samples. Taken together, our results suggest a novel role for SALL4 in drug sensitivity, at least in part through the maintenance of SP cells, and therefore may be responsible for drug-resistance in leukemia. We are the first to demonstrate a direct link between stem cell factor SALL4, SP and drug resistance in leukemia. © 2011 Jeong et al.

79956286590	Postoperative radiotherapy for resected pathological stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study of 221 cases from a single institution	Background. For patients with resected pathological stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the role of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) is not well defined. In this single-institutional study, we re-evaluated the effect of PORT on overall survival (OS) as well as tumor control in this subgroup of patients. Methods. In 2003-2005, 221 consecutive patients with resected pathological stage IIIA-N2 NSCLC at our institution were retrospectively analyzed in an institutional review board-approved study. The effect of PORT on OS, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. The impact of PORT on locoregional control and distant metastasis was also analyzed. Results. Compared with the control, patients treated with PORT had a significantly longer OS time (χ

79958164294	The impact of positive cancer family history on the clinical features and outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer	The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of positive cancer/lung cancer family history (FH) on clinical features and outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed 4,491 NSCLC patients with NSCLC who presented from January 1999-December 2005. Chi-square test and Wilcoxon test were used for univariate comparisons, while Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis was performed to evaluate the adjusted risk of death. Univariate probability of survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and compared using the log-rank test. Of 4,491 patients, 579 patients (12.89%) had positive FH, including 233 patients (5.19%) with FH of lung cancer. Patients with positive lung cancer FH, compared to those with negative FH, were diagnosed at earlier age (57 vs. 60; P < 0.001), presented more cases of adenocarcinoma (58.80 vs. 50.69%; P = 0.016), and at more advanced stage (Stage IIIB/IV 45.74 vs. 36.79%; P < 0.001). These differences were also detected in patients with positive cancer FH. In addition, more females and non-smokers were among patients with positive cancer FH (30.05 vs. 26.15%; P = 0.045 and 39.90 vs. 33.82%; P = 0.008, respectively). Furthermore, patients with advanced cancer (stage IIIB/IV) who had positive FH had lower response rate to chemotherapy (CR&PR 24.68 vs. 34.42%; P = 0.024). Nevertheless, patients with positive lung cancer FH had better prognosis (P = 0.015), especially if diagnosed at an early stage (P = 0.035), and their adjusted relative risk of death was lower (RR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.51-0.93; P = 0.015). Definite epidemiologic and survival differences exist between NSCLC patients with positive or negative FH of cancer. Our results suggest that cancer FH is an important factor of clinical features, and could serve as a prognostic indicator for NSCLC. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

79960037044	Mir-29c induces cell cycle arrest in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by modulating cyclin E expression	Cyclin E is reported to be an important cell cycle regulator, and its dysregulation is implicated in tumorigenesis including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and play important roles in tumor initiation and progression. However, the regulation of cyclin E by miRNAs is still unclear in ESCC. In the present study, we found that overexpression of miR-29c inhibited cyclin E expression by targeting 3′ untranslated region of cyclin E messenger RNA in ESCC cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-29c induced cell cycle G

79960620429	Diallyl disulfide downregulates Mcl-1 via the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathway during the apoptosis of leukemia cells	Objective: To investigate the role of MAPKs, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway, and the Bcl-2 family proteins in diallyl disulfide (DADS)-induced apoptosis. Methods: Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect apoptotic cells. Western blot analysis of the expression of phospho-MAPKs ( ERK and p38), phospho-AKT, and the Bcl-2 family proteins was used to elucidate the possible mechanisms of DADS-induced apoptosis. Results: DADS induced significant apoptosis, which exhibited a dose-dependent and time-dependent response (P < 0.05). DADS inhibited the ERK/MAPK and the PI3K/AKT pathways, followed by the downregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor Mcl-1 and the upregulation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax. The P38/MAPK pathways were activated and did not affect the expression of Mcl-1 and Bax. Small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of Mcl-1 significantly sensitized the leukemia cells to DADS-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: These results clearly demonstrate that the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling path¬way is involved in the induction of apoptosis by DADS and it is mediated by the downregulation of Mcl-1 in human HL-60 cells.

The pooled OR of TM+ MM compared to TT under dominant model was 0. 96 without statistically significant association (95% CI: 0.86-1.06). CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that XRCC3 Thr241Met may not contribute to the susceptibility of lung cancer.

80052439196	Ribosomal protein RPL41 induces rapid degradation of ATF4, a transcription factor critical for tumour cell survival in stress	By activating protective pathways, tumour cells are not only capable of survival in stress, but often associated with increased aggressiveness and metastasis. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is a major coordinator of tumour cell survival in stress and is commonly overexpressed in tumours. Numerous studies suggested that the ATF4 is a potential therapeutic target for cancer. In this report, we describe that a small ribosomal peptide, RPL41, induced rapid ATF4 degradation. By immunofluorescence staining, RPL41 induced ATF4 relocation from nuclei to cytoplasm, where ATF4 co-stained with a proteasome marker; the RPL41-induced ATF4 relocation and degradation were blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. An in vivo phosphorylation study showed that RPL41 induced ATF4 phosphorylation and serine 219 of ATF4 was essential for RPL41-induced ATF4 degradation. Cells with RPL41 knockdown had significantly increased ATF4, suggesting that RPL41 could play a physiological role in regulating the cellular ATF4 level. RPL41 was capable of inducing tumour cell death and cell cycle arrest; at low dose, RPL41 sensitized tumour cells A549 to the DNA damage agent cisplatin. These studies suggest that RPL41, a small peptide that is chemically synthesizable and capable of self-cell penetration, may have potential as an anti-ATF4 agent for cancer therapy.

80455173422	A 5-MicroRNA signature for lung squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis and hsa-miR-31 for prognosis	Purpose: Recent studies have suggested that microRNA biomarkers could be useful for stratifying lung cancer subtypes, but microRNA signatures varied between different populations. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one major subtype of lung cancer that urgently needs biomarkers to aid patient management. Here, we undertook the first comprehensive investigation on microRNA in Chinese SCC patients. Experimental Design: MicroRNA expression was measured in cancerous and noncancerous tissue pairs strictly collected from Chinese SCC patients (stages I-III), who had not been treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. The molecular targets of proposed microRNA were further examined. Results: We identified a 5-microRNA classifier (hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-182, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsamiR- 30a, and hsa-miR-140-3p) that could distinguish SCC from normal lung tissues. The classifier had an accuracy of 94.1% in a training cohort (34 patients) and 96.2% in a test cohort (26 patients). We also showed that high expression of hsa-miR-31 was associated with poor survival in these 60 SCC patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.007), by univariate Cox analysis (P = 0.011), and by multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.011). This association was independently validated in a separate cohort of 88 SCC patients (P = 0.008, 0.011, and 0.003 in Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate Cox analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis, respectively). We then determined that the tumor suppressor DICER1 is a target of hsa-miR-31. Expression of hsa-miR-31 in a human lung cancer cell line repressed DICER1 activity but not PPP2R2A or LATS2. Conclusions: Our results identified a new diagnostic microRNA classifier for SCC among Chinese patients and a new prognostic biomarker, hsa-miR-31. ©2011 AACR.

84861222679	MicroRNA-25 promotes cell migration and invasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as a species of small non coding single stranded RNA of about 21-25 nucleotides have important roles in the development of different cancers. In present study, we found that the expression of miR-25 was up-regulated in 60 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues compared with matched adjacent non-cancer tissues. Moreover, we demonstrated that the up-regulation of miR-25 was significantly correlated with the status of lymph node metastasis and TNM (Tumor, Node and Metastasis) stage. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-25 markedly promoted migration and invasion of ESCC cells. On the contrary, down-regulation of miR-25 inhibited the migration and invasion of cells. E-cadherin(CDH1) is a very important tumor metastasis suppressor. We further identified that miR-25 directly targeted CDH1 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and repressed the expression of CDH1. These results, for the first time, demonstrate that miR-25 promotes ESCC cell migration and invasion by suppressing CDH1 expression. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862062518	Comparison of the results of lymph node dissection via left versus right thoracotomy	Objective: Up to now surgical treatment has been still the most effective treatment for esophageal cancer. However, postoperative lymph node recurrence is still a frequent event and affects long term survival considerably. The aim of this study is to compare the results of lymph node dissection via left vs. right thoracotomies and to verify whether there is any essential difference in lymphadenectomy between these two approaches. Methods: Five hundred and fifty-nine cases with thoracic esophageal cancer were randomly selected from the database of esophageal cancer patients who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital between May 2005 and January 2011, including 282 cases through left thoracotomy and 277 cases through right thoracotomy. This series consisted of 449 males and 110 females with a mean age of 58.8 years (age range: 36-78 years). The pathological types were mainly squamous cell carcinoma (548 cases) and other rare types (11 cases). The data were analyzed and compared using Chi-square test. The P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The actual 5-year survival rate was calculated based on the recent follow-up data of the patients who underwent surgery at least 5 years ago. Results: The average number of dissected lymph nodes was 23.4 via left versus 24.6 via right thoracotomies. The overall lymph node metastasis rate was 48.9% via left thoracotomy and 53.8% via right thoracotomy, and 34.8% vs. 50.5% in the chest (P <0.001), 29.1% vs. 17.7% in the abdomen (P = 0.001). The pathologically confirmed lymph node metastasis rate was 45.9%, 44.0% and 34.9% in the upper, middle and lower segments of thoracic esophagus, respectively. The lymph node metastasis rates detected via left and right thoracotomy in the stage T1 cases were 14.7% (5/34) vs. 42.9% (12/28) (P <0.001), and in the stage T2 cases were 35.4% (17/48) vs. 52.8% (28/53) (P = 0.007); in the station of para-thoracic esophagus were 9.6% vs. 13.4%, in the left upper mediastinum were 2.1% vs. 7.6%, and in the right upper mediastinum were 1.4% vs. 26.0%, respectively. The preliminary actual 5-year survival rate was 38.2% in the cases via left thoracotomy vs. 42.1% in those via right thoracotomy. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that lymph node dissection is more complete via right thoracotomy than via left thoracotomy, especially for the tracheoesophageal groove and para-recurrent laryngeal nerve nodes, which may eventually improve the survival of patients with esophageal cancer. Therefore, surgical treatment via right thoracotomy by Ivor-Lewis (two incisions) mode or Levis-Tanner (three incisions) mode with two-field or three-field complete lymph node dissection may become prevalent in the future.

84862064918	Comparison of the short-term outcomes of surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer via video assisted thoracoscopic surgery and open thoracotomy	Objective: To compare the short-term outcomes of surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy (OT). Methods: Data of 737 consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent surgical treatment for non-small cell lung cancer by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and 630 patients who underwent pulmonary resection via open thoracotomy (as controls) in Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between January 2009 and August 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The risk factors after lobectomy were also analyzed. Results: In the 506 NSCLC patients who received VATS lobectomy, postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (2.6%) and one patient died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (0.2%). In the 521 patients who received open thoracotomy (OT) lobectomy, postoperative complications occurred in 21 patients (4.0%) and one patient died of pulmonary infection (0.2%). There was no significant difference in the morbidity rate (P >0.05) and mortality rate (P >0.05) between the VATS group and OT group. In the 190 patients who received VATS wedge resections, postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients (1.6%). One hundred and nine patients received OT wedge resections. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 patients (3.7%). There were no significant differences for morbidity rate (P = 0.262) between these two groups, and there was no perioperative death in these two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that age (OR = 1.047, 95% CI: 1.004-1.091), history of smoking (OR = 6.374, 95% CI: 2.588-15.695) and operation time (OR = 1.418, 95% CI: 1.075-1.871) were independent risk factors of postoperative complications. Conclusions: To compare with the NSCLC patients who should undergo lobectomy or wedge resection via open thoracotomy, a similar short-term outcome can be achieved via VATS approach.

84862185825	Identification and characterization of a novel gene, c1orf109, encoding a CK2 substrate that is involved in cancer cell proliferation	Background: In the present study we identified a novel gene, Homo Sapiens Chromosome 1 ORF109 (c1orf109, GenBank ID: NM-017850.1), which encodes a substrate of CK2. We analyzed the regulation mode of the gene, the expression pattern and subcellular localization of the predicted protein in the cell, and its role involving in cell proliferation and cell cycle control. Methods. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation and EMSA were used to analysis the basal transcriptional requirements of the predicted promoter regions. C1ORF109 expression was assessed by western blot analysis. The subcellular localization of C1ORF109 was detected by immunofluorescence and immune colloidal gold technique. Cell proliferation was evaluated using MTT assay and colony-forming assay. Results: We found that two cis-acting elements within the crucial region of the c1orf109 promoter, one TATA box and one CAAT box, are required for maximal transcription of the c1orf109 gene. The 5 flanking region of the c1orf109 gene could bind specific transcription factors and Sp1 may be one of them. Employing western blot analysis, we detected upregulated expression of c1orf109 in multiple cancer cell lines. The protein C1ORF109 was mainly located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Moreover, we also found that C1ORF109 was a phosphoprotein in vivo and could be phosphorylated by the protein kinase CK2 in vitro. Exogenous expression of C1ORF109 in breast cancer Hs578T cells induced an increase in colony number and cell proliferation. A concomitant rise in levels of PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) and cyclinD1 expression was observed. Meanwhile, knockdown of c1orf109 by siRNA in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells confirmed the role of c1orf109 in proliferation. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that C1ORF109 may be the downstream target of protein kinase CK2 and involved in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation. © 2012 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84863027455	Comparison of the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical bowel obstruction due to tumor or other causes	Objective: The aim of this study was to review the etiology and pathogenesis of patients who underwent surgery for mechanical bowel obstruction. The treatment and prognosis of bowel obstructions caused by intra-abdominal tumors were compared with those due to other causes. Methods The clinical data of 203 patients with mechanical bowel obstruction undergoing operation were analyzed retrospectively. The tumor cases were classified as group I, and all other cases as group II. A range of factors were investigated to estimate the postoperative outcome: gender, age, comorbidities, symptoms and findings of physical and radiological examinations, sites of the obstruction, etiology, therapeutic approach, postoperative complications and mortality. Results Group I included 73 patients and Group II 130. Large bowel carcinoma and peritoneal adhesions were the most common causes of Group I and II, contributing 58 and 86 of all cases, respectively. There was no significant difference in terms of gender between the two groups, but the rate of elderly (≥70 years) patients was significantly higher (53.4%) than that of the <70 years old patients (35.4%) (P=0.012). There was a significant difference between the patients with previous surgical operation history in the tumor group (23.3% ) and non-tumor group (58.5%) (P<0.001). In the 73 cases of the tumor group, the obstruction was located in the large bowel in 58 cases (79.5%), small bowel in 12 cases (16.4%), both small and large bowels in 2 cases (2.7%) and gastric cancer invading the splenic flexure of colon in 1 case, while in the non-tumor group, 111 cases (85.4%) of the obstruction was located in the small bowel and 19 cases (14.6%) and in the large bowel (P < 0.001). Sixty-six cases (90.4%) of the tumor-group underwent intestinal segment excision and 21 cases (28.8%) underwent intestinal fistulation in the tumor group, but in the non-tumor group 61 cases (46.9%) underwent intestinal segment excision and 5 cases (3.8%) underwent intestinal fistulation (all P < 0.001). The hospital stay was (18 ± 6) days in the tumor group and (11 ± 3) days in the non-tumor group (P < 0.01). The complication rate (P=0.104) and mortality rate (P=0.187) were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions: Tumor mechanical bowel obstruction is more frequently seen in patients in elder age, with colorectal location and without previous operation history. CT scan may provide effective diagnosis and ascertain the presence of the malignant obstruction. Intestinal fistulation is more often needed in patients with tumor intestinal obstruction and endoscopic stenting is a safe option in selected patients with tumor intestinal obstruction.

84863053122	Identification of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer by proteomic analysis	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. To explore tumor biomarkers for clinical application, two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis and subsequent MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry were performed to identify proteins differentially expressed in 12 pairs of lung squamous cell tumors and their corresponding normal tissues. A total of 28 nonredundant proteins were identified with significant alteration in lung tumors. The up-regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), superoxide dismutase 2, 14-3-3ε, and receptor of activated protein kinase C1 and the down-regulation of peroxiredoxin 2 in tumors were validated by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in independent 15 pairs of samples. Increased IDH1 expression was further verified by the immunohistochemical study in extended 73 squamous cell carcinoma and 64 adenocarcinoma clinical samples. A correlation between IDH1 expression and poor overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients was observed. Furthermore, ELISA analysis showed that the plasma level of IDH1 was significantly elevated in NSCLC patients compared with benign lung disease patients and healthy individuals. In addition, knockdown of IDH1 by RNA interference suppressed the proliferation of NSCLC cell line and decreased the growth of xenograft tumors in vivo. These observations suggested that IDH1, as a protein promoting tumor growth, could be used as a plasma biomarker for diagnosis and a histochemical biomarker for prognosis prediction of NSCLC. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Methods: In 2010, 48 cancer registries reported cancer incidence and mortality data of 2007 to National Central Cancer Registry of China. Of them, 38 registries' data met the national criteria. Incidence and mortality were calculated by cancer sites, age, gender, and area. Age-standardized rates were described by China and World population. Results: The crude incidence rate for all cancers was 276.16/100,000 (305.22/100,000 for male and 246.46/100,000 for female; 284.71/100,000 in urban and 251.07/100,000 in rural). Age-standardized incidence rates by China and World population were 145.39/100,000 and 189.46/100,000 respectively. The crude mortality rate for all cancers was 177.09/100,000 (219.15/100,000 for male and 134.10/100,000 for female; 173.55/100,000 in urban and 187.49/100,000 in rural). Age-standardized mortality rates by China and World population were 86.06/100,000 and 116.46/100,000, respectively. The top 10 most frequently common cancer sites were the lung, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, breast, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, brain and lymphoma, accounting for 76.12% of the total cancer cases. The top 10 causes of cancer death were cancers of the lung, liver, stomach, esophagus, colon and rectum, pancreas, breast, leukemia, brain and lymphoma, accounting for 84.37% of the total cancer deaths. Conclusion: Cancer remains a major disease threatening people's health in China. Prevention and control should be enhanced, especially for the main cancers. © 2012 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864129408	Proteome analysis of human gastric cancer MGC803 cells induced by diallyl disulfide	Aim: To investigate the differential proteomic expression in human gastric cancer MGC803 cells induced by diallyl disulfide (DADS). Methods: A series of methods, including immobilized pH gradient-two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, silver staining, PDQuest 2-DE software analysis, peptide mass fingerpringting based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and SWISS-PROT database searching, were used to separate and identify the differential proteomic expressions in MGC803 cells induced by DADS. Results: The results showed that the good 2-DE pattern including high resolution and reproducibility was obtained. After silver staining, the 2-DE image analysis by PDQuest 2-DE software detected average spots were(576 ± 14) spots and (583 ± 4) and the matching rate was 76% and 70% in DADS untreated and treated, respectively. The differential proteomic expression analysis found that there were 421 spots matched and 200 spots unmatched between untreated and treated maps. In SWISS-PROT database with MS-FIT software, twenty-four proteins were preliminarily identified related to differentiation, cell cycle, apoptosis, metastasis, cytoimmunity and metabolism, such as gastric mucin, nM23, CDC2, uPAR, LIMK, RORα, MHC DR-beta-1, TCR, etc. There was a significant difference at protein level between untreated and treated MGC803 cells. Conclusions: DADS might induce differentiation in human gastric cancer MGC803 cells through different ways. It suggests that the differential expression analysis of proteome may be useful to further study of differentiation related proteins and markers in gastric cancer.

84864212831	Preliminary experience of clinical applications of the 7th UICC-AJCC TNM staging system of esophageal carcinoma	Objective: To compare the instructive value of the 6th and 7th editions of the UICC-AJCC staging system in prognosis of esophageal cancer (EC) patients. Methods: The staging and prognosis of 1397 esophageal carcinoma patients undergoing curative resection from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2006 in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed according to the 6th AJCC staging system and the 7th UICC-AJCC staging system. Results: The 5-year overall survival (OS) of EC patients with curative resection was 38.5% (481/1250 cases), with a follow-up rate of 89.5% (1250/1397 case). In overall terms, both the editions were statistically significant discriminators of OS (P < 0.05). The 5-year OS of stages I, II and III patients were 64.9%, 43.5%, 25.2% according to the 6th edition, and 63.5%, 44.5%, 23.5% according to the 7th edition, respectively. Distinct differences in survival were present among patients categorized as stage Ia and Ib according to the 7th edition (P < 0.05), with a 5-year OS of 80.0% and 58.3%, respectively. Similarly, according to the 7th edition, the 5-year overall survivals (OS) of the stages IIIa, IIIb and IIIc patients were 28.2%, 18.4% and 16.7%, respectively, showing that the prognoses were significantly different (P < 0.05). In addition, according to the 7th edition, the prognoses of patients in stages N0, N1, N2 and N3 were also significantly different (P < 0.01), and the 5-year OS were 50.0%, 31.5%, 18.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Conclusions: Both the 6th and 7th editions of UICC-AJCC staging system are significant discriminators for survival of esophageal cancer patients. The 7th edition is proved to be more accurate in prognosis. The number of lymph node metastases is an important predictor of prognosis.

84865161008	Report of incidence and mortality in china cancer registries, 2008	Objective: Annual cancer incidence and mortality in 2008 were provided by National Central Cancer Registry in China, which data were collected from population-based cancer registries in 2011. Methods: There were 56 registries submitted their data in 2008. After checking and evaluating the data quality, total 41 registries' data were accepted and pooled for analysis. Incidence and mortality rates by area (urban or rural areas) were assessed, as well as the age- and sex-specific rates, age-standardized rates, proportions and cumulative rate. Results: The coverage population of the 41 registries was 66,138,784 with 52,158,495 in urban areas and 13,980,289 in rural areas. There were 197,833 new cancer cases and 122,136 deaths in cancer with mortality to incidence ratio of 0.62. The morphological verified rate was 69.33%, and 2.23% of cases were identified by death certificate only. The crude cancer incidence rate in all areas was 299.12/100,000 (330.16/100,000 in male and 267.56/100,000 in female) and the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and world standard population (ASIRW) were 148.75/100,000 and 194.99/100,000, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) was of 22.27%. The crude incidence rate in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas. However, after adjusted by age, the incidence rate in urban was lower than that in rural. The crude cancer mortality was 184.67/100,000 (228.14/100,000 in male and 140.48/100,000 in female), and the age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world population were 84.36/100,000 and 114.32/100,000, respectively. The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 years old) was of 12.89%. Age-adjusted mortality rates in urban areas were lower than that in rural areas. The most common cancer sites were lung, stomach, colon-rectum, liver, esophagus, pancreas, brain, lymphoma, breast and cervix which accounted for 75% of all cancer incidence. Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer death, followed by gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer and pancreas cancer, which accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer spectrum varied by areas and sex in rural areas, cancers from digestive system were more common, such as esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and liver cancer, while incidence rates of lung cancer and colorectal cancer were much higher in urban areas. In addition, breast cancer was the most common cancer in urban women followed by liver cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Conclusion: Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer and female breast cancer contributed to the increased incidence of cancer, which should be paid more attention to in further national cancer prevention and control program. Different cancer control strategies should be carried out due to the varied cancer spectrum in different groups. © 2012 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84864353377	Risk factors of brain metastases in completely resected pathological stage IIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer	Background: Brain metastases (BM) is one of the most common failures of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) after combined-modality therapy. The outcome of trials on prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has prompted us to identify the highest-risk subset most likely to benefit from PCI. Focusing on patients with completely resected pathological stage IIIA-N2 (pIIIA-N2) NSCLC, we aimed to assess risk factors of BM and to define the highest-risk subset.Methods: Between 2003 and 2005, the records of 217 consecutive patients with pIIIA-N2 NSCLC in our institution were reviewed. The cumulative incidence of BM was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between the groups were analyzed using log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to assess risk factors of BM.Results: Fifty-three (24.4 %) patients developed BM at some point during their clinical course. On multivariate analysis, non-squamous cell cancer (relative risk [RR]: 4.13, 95 % CI: 1.86-9.19; P = 0.001) and the ratio of metastatic to examined nodes or lymph node ratio (LNR) ≥ 30 % (RR: 3.33, 95 % CI: 1.79-6.18; P = 0.000) were found to be associated with an increased risk of BM. In patients with non-squamous cell cancer and LNR ≥ 30 %, the 5-year actuarial risk of BM was 57.3 %.Conclusions: In NSCLC, patients with completely resected pIIIA-N2 non-squamous cell cancer and LNR ≥ 30 % are at the highest risk for BM, and are most likely to benefit from PCI. Further studies are warranted to investigate the effect of PCI on this subset of patients. © 2012 Ding et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84864419089	Teaching the cell biology of aging at the Harbin Institute of Technology and Moscow State University	Approaches to teaching the cell biology of aging (cytogerontology), within the appropriate agreements by scientists of the Biological Faculty of Moscow State University and at the Department of Life Science and Engineering of Harbin Institute of Technology (China), are described. The authors draw attention to certain differences in teaching biology between the two institutions and emphasize the significance of a system approach to teaching cytogerontology. This approach makes it absolutely necessary to introduce the course on the basics of biology of aging. It is concluded that full perception of the data from modern molecular cell cytogerontological research, by the students from both institutions, is impossible without understanding the fundamental notions and definitions used in both theoretical and experimental gerontology. © 2012 Allerton Press, Inc.

84865299110	Surgical treatment of sternal tumors: Resection of the tumors and reconstruction of the chest wall defects	Objective: To investigate the efficacy of surgical treatment of sternal tumors and repairing methods of the chest wall defects. Methods: Fifteen patients with sternal tumors were diagnosed and underwent resection of the sternal tumors according to the en-bolck principle and repair of the chest wall defects using various materials from January 1968 to December 2010 in our hospital. Results: Of 6 patients with sternal manubrim tumors, one patient had reconstruction only with steel wire, other 5 patients healed completely after repair with soft materials. Of 7 patients with sternal body tumors, one patient recovered quickly without reconstruction because he had only partial resection; four patients had chest wall repair with soft materials, but they breathed hardly; and two patients had chest wall reconstruction with rigid materials. One patient had ventilatory support, another patient recovered quickly. Ventilatory support was needed in two patients treated by subtotal sternectomy because they had chest wall repair with soft materials. Conclusions: In surgical treatment of sternal tumors by manubrim sternetomy, the chest wall defects can be constructed with soft materials. After resection of sternal body tumors and subtotal sternectomy, the thoracic wall defects need to be reconstructed with rigid materials.

84865304733	Trend analysis of cancer mortality in China between 1989 and 2008	Objective: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in China. The study aimed to examine the temporal trend of cancer mortality rate during 1989-2008 in urban and rural areas of China. Methods: The mortality data of all cancers from 1989 to 2008 from National Cancer Registry database were sorted and checked. Age standardized mortality rates were calculated by the direct methods using the China population of 1982 and World Segi's population. Joinpoint regression was performed to obtain the annual percentage changes (APC) in mortality rates. The top ten cancer sites were calculated and analyzed. The mortality rates were compared with statistics of the United States. Results: From 1989 to 2008, the trend of crude cancer mortality increased with an annual percentage change (APC) of 1.0%. After age standardization, the mortality rate was significantly decreased, with an APC of -1.2%. In urban areas, lung cancer was the most common cancer of death, whereas in rural areas, stomach cancer and esophageal cancer remained top cancers of death. Especially, in both urban and rural areas, the mortality of lung cancer was on increase. The mortality rates of stomach and esophageal cancers showed a decrease in urban areas. Compared with the cancer mortality rates of the United States, the Chinese cancer mortality rate in males remained highest. The decreasing trend of cancer mortality in females of China was less obvious than that of the United States. Conclusions: The crude mortality rates of cancer in China show an increase whereas the age standardized mortality raters has declined between 1989 and 2008. Cancer is still a major public health issue threatening people's life in China. Effective intervention for cancer control and prevention is needed in the future.

84866124741	MicroRNA-133b is a key promoter of cervical carcinoma development through the activation of the ERK and AKT1 pathways	We report that elevated microRNA-133b (miR-133b) acts as an oncogene in human cervical carcinoma to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. In situ hybridization confirmed that miR-133b is localized in proliferating human cervical carcinoma cells with levels progressively elevating throughout advancing stages. Cellular studies showed that miR-133b enhances cell proliferation and colony formation by targeting mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 2 (MST2), cell division control protein 42 homolog (CDC42) and ras homolog gene family member A (RHOA), which subsequently results in activation of the tumorigenic protein kinase B alpha (AKT1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1 and ERK2, here abbreviated as ERK) signaling pathways. Mouse experiments revealed that upregulation of miR-133b in cervical carcinoma cells strongly promotes both in vivo tumorigenesis and independent metastasis to the mouse lung. The data indicates that upregulation of miR-133b shortens the latency of cervical carcinoma. Together, these findings suggest that miR-133b could be a potent marker for the early onset of cervical carcinoma. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84866908261	Clinical analysis of 19 cases of adult primary mediastinal liposarcoma	Objective: To explore the pathoclinical features of adult primary mediastinal liposarcoma and their correlation with the prognosis. Methods: The clinical data of 19 patients with adult primary mediastinal liposarcoma who were treated in our hospital between 1970 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Eighteen patients underwent open thoracic tumor excisions for at least one time, and the remaining one patient only received biopsy surgery. Histopathological results after surgery revealed that 6 well-differentiated type tumors, 6 myxoid type tumors, 3 pleomorphic type tumors, 2 mixed type tumors, and 2 un-classified tumors. Results: Among 6 patients with well-differentiated type tumors, 1 died after having been survived for 10 years; 5 were still alive, with a mean duration of 126.2 months, the 5-year survival rate was 100%. Among 6 patients with myxoid type tumors, 5 patients had follow-up data, with a mean survival of 26.2 months. Among 3 patients with pleomorphic type tumors, only one patient had follow-up data: the patient finally died, with a survival of 34 months. Of 2 patients with mixed type tumors, only one patient had follow-up data: the patient survived 8 months and died. Of 2 patients with un-classified type tumors, one had follow-up data: the patient lived for 24 months and died. Conclusions: Mediastinal liposarcoma is a rare disease. Surgery is the primary therapeutic modality. Different pathological subtypes have different epidemiological features, biological behaviors, and malignant potentials. Pathological subtype is an important prognosis factor. Patients with well-differentiated tumors have much better prognosis than those with other subtypes.

84868673438	Diagnosis and surgical treatment of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma	Objective: As a rare benign lung tumor, pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma (PSH) occurs predominantly in Asian women in their fifth and sixth decades of life. PSH is considered to be evolved from primitive undifferentiated respiratory epithelium. In this study, we summarized our experience in 89 cases of PSH. Method: There were a total of 89 patients who received surgical resection and were histopathologically diagnosed as PSH during the period January 2001 to December 2010 in department of thoracic surgery, Cancer Institute and Hospital, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The clinical data of these patients including symptoms, disease courses, image characteristics and surgical procedures were collected and reviewed retrospectively. Results: The PSHs were most frequently (50.6%) found in the patients aged 41 to 60 years with a median age of 51 years (range: 24-71), and the sex ratio (male/female) was approximately 1:7 in this series. In the 89 patients, 53 (59.6%) were asymptomatic while the other 36 (40.4%) had some non-special symptoms such as cough (30.3%), hemoptysis (24.7%). There were only 3 cases (3.4%) with multiple PSHs, 4 cases (4.5%) combined with synchronous primary lung cancer, and 13 cases (14.6%) with lesions located in the hilar region. The median diameter of the 92 lesions was 2.3 cm (range; 0.3-6.0 cm), of which 38% located in the right lower lobe and 26.1% in the right middle lobe, and only about 1/3 were assumed as PSHs preoperatively based on CT imaging. One of the five patients who underwent PET-CT scan had been misdiagnosed as malignant. Of the 92 lesions, 47 were resected by enucleation, 29 by wedge resection, 14 by lobectomy, and 2 by pneumonectomy. Conclusion: PSH frequently occurs in the middle-aged women. Most individuals with PSH are asymptomatic or have some non-specific symptoms. Their lesions are usually found accidentally by chest imaging. Although PSH often shows typical imaging characteristics of benign neoplasm of the lung, it is difficult to establish a defined pathological diagnosis preoperatively. The significant error or deferred rate of intraoperative frozen-section evaluation for PSH may result in some unnecessarily extensive surgical procedures. The complete surgical resection is considered the only effective treatment for PSH, and the normal pulmonary tissue should be reserved as possible.

84869786587	Clinical observation of 16 patients with synchronous esophageal cancer and lung cancer treated with simultaneous esophagus and lung resection	Objective: To study the pathogenesis, clinical features, curative effect and prognosis of esophageal cancer associated with lung cancer. Methods: We reviewed 16 cases of esophageal cancer associated with lung cancer managed at our hospital between January 2003 and July 2009 and analyzed their clinical data. Results: There were 16 cases of esophageal cancer associated with lung cancer. There were 12 males and 4 females with a male to female ratio of 3:1. The average age at the onset of the disease was 67 years old (range: 51-76). The resection rate of esophageal cancers was 100%. There was 1 case of nonradical resection. And the resection rate of lung cancer was 100%. There were radical resection (n = 7) and wedge resection (n = 9). The 1-year overall survival rate was 87.5%. Conclusion: Lung lesions of esophageal cancer patients may be discovered by computed tomography screening of chest. More male patients than female patients are diagnosed with esophageal cancer associated with lung cancer. The operative risks and complication rates are generally acceptable.

84869801225	Values of fractional exhaled nitric oxide in the diagnosis of chronic cough	Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic value of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in the diagnosis of chronic cough. Methods: A total of 106 subjects with chronic cough and normal chest radiographs were recruited from October 2009 to September 2010, Based oh the management guidelines of the Chinese Respiratory Society for cough, the golden standard methods were used to make the definite diagnosis of chronic cough, including sputum cell counts, pulmonary function tests, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, skin pricking test and serum immunoglobulin E. All subjects received a FeNO test by a NIOXMINO analyzer. The values of FeNO to diagnose cough variant asthma (CVA) from chronic cough and EB from non-asthma cough were respectively assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Among them, the definite diagnoses were cough variant asthma (CVA, n = 39), eosinophilic bronchitis (EB, n = 30) and other causes (n = 37).

84869215558	Surgical treatment and prognostic analysis of 109 patients with primary esophageal small cell carcinoma	Objective: Since the principles of treatment of primary esophageal small cell carcinoma (PESCC) remain still in controversy, the aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics, treatment modalities and prognostic factors of this malignancy. Methods: The clinical data of 109 patients treated by surgery in our hospital between October 1989 and April 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. According to the most recently published TNM staging system for esophageal cancer (AJCC 2009), there were 17 patients in stage I b, 31 patients in stage II, 59 patients in stage III, and 2 patients in stage IV. All the data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 software. The median survival time (MST) and overall survival rate (OS) were calculated and compared by the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. The prognostic factors were calculated by Cox hazard regression model. Results: Among all the 109 patients included, 93 patients were treated by radical esophagectomy, and 11 patients by palliative resection, while 5 patients by exploration. The median survival time (MST) of the whole group was 14.4 months and the 1-, 3-and 5-year overall survival rates (OS) were 56.9%, 17.6%, and 12.0%, respectively. The median survival time (MST) and 5-year overall survival rates (OS) were 18.5 months and 21.4% for pathological N0 cases, 23.5 months and 24.0% for N1 cases, 8.5 months and 0% for N2 cases, and 10.5 months and 0% for N3 cases, respectively (P < 0.001). The MST and 1-, 3- and 5-year OS of patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy were 17.0 months, 60.7%, 19.8%, and 13.0%, respectively, statistically significantly longer than the 7.0 months, 28.5%, 8.9% and 8.9%, respectively, of the patients without chemotherapy (P = 0.005). The pathological N stage and postoperative chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors by Cox multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Primary esophageal small cell carcinoma is an aggressive systemic disease, characterized by early and wide dissemination of lymph nodes and poor prognosis while treated with surgery or chemotherapy alone. Multimodality treatment based on radical esophagectomy should be recommended for patients in pathological stage I and II.

84869221409	Correlation study of the overexpression of activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 and the stage and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the expression and relationship of activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (ACK1) and the clinical characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: The ACK1 expression in ESCC cell lines was detected by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assay the expression level of ACK1 protein in tumor tissues and adjacent normal epithelium from 105 ESCC patients in tissue microarray and 45 patients in normal tissue slices. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) was performed to determine the expression level of ACK1 mRNA in 45 pairs of ESCC frozen tissues. Results: The expression level of ACK1 protein was significantly up-regulated in 48.6% ESCC tissues as compared with the normal adjacent epithelium in tissue microarray. The overexpression of ACK1 was significantly correlated with the lymph node metastasis and TNM stage of ESCC patients. The results of normal tissue slices were consistent with those of tissue microarray. Furthermore the overexpression of ACK1 was associated with a poor survival of ESCC patients (P=0.030). The elevated mRNA level of ACK1 in ESCC tissues was correlated with the lymph node metastasis and TNM stage of ESCC patients. And a significant correlation was observed between protein and mRNA level of ACK1 (P=0.021). Conclusion: The up-regulated expressions of ACK1 protein and mRNA are correlated with the progression and prognosis of ESCC.

Methods: The 14-3-3ε expression in tumors and adjacent normal epithelia from 72 ESCC patients was detected by immunohistochemical staining. Correlations of 14-3-3ε expression or their subcellular localization and clinicopathological factors were analyzed using Chi-squared test. Survival curves were generated according to the Kaplan-Meier method, and the statistical analysis was performed by Log-rank test. Results: The expression of 14-3-3ε protein was significantly up-regulated in tumors with 77.8% positive and 27.8% strong positive staining, compared with paired adjacent normal epithelia with 43.1% positive and only 2.8% strong positive staining (P < 0.01). In a total of 56 positive staining tumors, 14-3-3ε was detected in cytoplasm of 37 (66.1%), in nucleus of 4 (7.1%), in both cytoplasm and nucleus of 15 (26.8%) cases. Whereas, in a total of 31 positive staining normal epithelia, 14-3-3ε was detected in cytoplasm of 0, in nucleus of 13 (41.9%), in both cytoplasm and nucleus of 18 (58.1%) cases (P < 0.01). Statistical analysis revealed that strong 14-3-3ε expression was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.028) and lower 5-year survival (P = 0.018). The survival curves calculated by Kaplan-Meier method further showed that the patients with strong 14-3-3ε expression had a shorter survival than patients with negative or weak 14-3-3ε expression (Log-rank, P = 0.031). No correlation was found between subcellular localization of 14-3-3ε in tumor cells and clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of ESCC patients. Conclusion: The 14-3-3ε expression is significantly up-regulated in ESCCs. It was usually located in cytoplasm of tumor cells, but nucleus of normal epithelia. Strong expression of 14-3-3ε in tumors is associated with lymph node metastasis and considered as an poor prognostic factor for ESCC. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84871709589	Characterization of patients and its relationship with medical complaints	Background Patient characteristics may be an internal factor influencing patient complaints, but in China patient characterization is restricted to patient satisfaction surveys, and few studies have considered the relationship between patient characteristics and patient complaints. The aim of this research was to determine the reasons for complaints. Methods In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of hospitalized patients and explored their relationship with medical complaints. Results The significant factors were age (P=0.045), hospital cost (P=0.003), household nature (P <0.001), and education (P <0.001). The complaint rate decreased when the patients' age increased (regression coefficient, -0.606; OR, 0.545, and 95%CI, 0.301-0.987). The complaint rate increased with an increase in hospital cost (regression coefficient, 0.818; OR, 2.266; and 95%CI, 1.320-3.889). Patients from non-agricultural households had a higher complaint rate (regression coefficient, 1.051; OR, 2.861; and 95%CI, 1.611-5.082). Patients with higher education levels had lower complaint rates (regression coefficient, -0.944; OR, 0.389; and 95%CI, 0.234-0.647). Conclusion The survey confirms that older patients and patients with higher education levels had lower complaint rates, while non-agricultural population and patients with higher hospital expenses had higher complaint rates.

84871330768	Clinical analysis of 47 cases of synchronous double primary carcinomas of esophagus and cardia	Objective: To explore the clinical features and prognosis of the patients with synchronous double primary malignancy of esophagus and cardia. Methods: The clinical data of patients with synchronous primary esophageal and cardiac carcinomas undergoing surgery at our hospital between April 1988 and April 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All data were analyzed by the SPSS 15.0 software. The overall survival rates (OS) were calculated and compared with the Kaplan-Meier method and the Log-rank test. The prognostic factors were identified by Cox's hazard regression model. Results: Among all 47 cases, esophageal carcinoma was missed preoperatively in 1 patients and cardiac carcinoma in 12. The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates (OS) of the whole group were 81.5%, 49.1% and 34.3% respectively. And the median survival time was 33 months. The univariate analysis of prognostic factors showed that radical resection, N stage of esophageal carcinoma (2009), N stage of cardiac carcinoma (2009) and TNM stage of cardiac carcinoma (both 2002 and 2009) might influence the long-term survival. However, according to the multivariate analysis, only radical resection and N stage of cardiac carcinoma (2009) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: With preoperative combined examination of esophagography and esophagoscopy and thorough intraoperative detection, the clinicians may reduce the rate of missed diagnosis for synchronous double primary esophageal and cardiac carcinomas. Radical resection of primary lesions and thorough dissection of locoregional lymph nodes may improve the patient survival. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84871768966	MiR-210 disturbs mitotic progression through regulating a group of mitosis-related genes	MiR-210 is up-regulated in multiple cancer types but its function is disputable and further investigation is necessary. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified the putative target genes of miR-210 in hypoxia-induced CNE cells from genome-wide scale. Two functional gene groups related to cell cycle and RNA processing were recognized as the major targets of miR-210. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanism and biological consequence of miR-210 in cell cycle regulation, particularly mitosis. Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of miR-210 was highly correlated with the down-regulation of a group of mitosis-related genes, including Plk1, Cdc25B, Cyclin F, Bub1B and Fam83D. MiR-210 suppressed the expression of these genes by directly targeting their 3′-UTRs. Over-expression of exogenous miR-210 disturbed mitotic progression and caused aberrant mitosis. Furthermore, miR-210 mimic with pharmacological doses reduced tumor formation in a mouse metastatic tumor model. Taken together, these results implicate that miR-210 disturbs mitosis through targeting multigenes involved in mitotic progression, which may contribute to its inhibitory role on tumor formation. © 2012 The Author(s).

84871417143	Application of video assisted thoracic surgery for chest tumors: Experience of 144 cases in a single institution	Objective: To evaluate the indication and safety of video assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for chest tumors. Methods: Data of 144 consecutive patients receiving VATS between January and November 2009 in Cancer hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There was no conversion to open thoracotomy. Overall morbidity rate was 2.08% (3/144) and mortality rate was 0.69% (1/144). There were no significant differences for operative time, number of nodal dissection, morbidity rate, mortality rate, overall hospitalization and postoperative length of stay between VATS lobectomy group and open thoracotomy (OT) lobectomy group. Chest tube duration was shorter in the VATS lobectomy group than OT lobectomy group and more early-stage lung cancer patients were found in VATS group. There were no significant differences for number of nodal dissection, chest tube duration, morbidity rate, mortality rate, and postoperative length of stay between VATS lung wedge resection group and OT lung wedge resection group. Operative time and overall hospitalization were shorter in the VATS wedge resection group than OT wedge resection group. Conclusion: Morbidity and mortality rate of VATS were acceptable. VATS lobectomy can be used as an alternative surgical technique for early-stage lung cancer. For lung wedge resection, VATS was superior than OT.

84871453639	Surgical treatment of bilateral thoracotomy in patients with lesions of left main bronchus invading carina	Objective: To investigate the outcome for surgical treatment of bilateral thoracotomy in patients with lesions of left main bronchus invading carina by bilateral thoracotomy. Methods: The clinical data of 4 patients with lesions of left main bronchus invading carina undergoing bilateral thoracotomy were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were two male and two female patients with a median age of 37.5 (range: 27-55) years old. Four patients were all accessed by bilateral thoracotomy, and received carinal reconstruction. Of these 4 patients, three patients received left pneumonectomy and one patient received carinal resection without concomitant pulmonary resection. Pathological results showed that one patient had tuberculosis. And other three patients were of 1 squamous cell carcinoma and 2 adenoid cystic carcinomas. Three patients received mechanical ventilation for a period of 3-21 days, one patient died of anastomotic dehiscence at 5 days postoperatively. Conclusion: Bilateral thoracotomy is an alternative approach for relatively young patients with decent cardiopulmonary functions with lesions of left main bronchus invading carina Operation type should be based on histopathological type and length of involved left main bronchus.

84872238977	Clinical analysis and surgical treatment of 14 cases of esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors	Objective: To explore the clinical features and surgical management of esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Methods: The clinical data of patients with esophageal GISTs undergoing surgery at our hospital between January 1999 and April 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of 14 patients, the male: female ratio was 8:6; the median age of the patients was 42 years (range 33-63 years). Dysphagia was the most common symptom, and all cases were diagnosed postoperatively. The tumors were resected by enucleation or esophagectomy or endoscopic submucosal resection. The median follow-up was 43.5 months, ranging from 2 to 142 months, with all patients have no recurrence and metastasis. Conclusion: Esophageal GIST is rather rare. At present, surgical resection and postoperative diagnosis remain the mainstay for treatment of patients with esophageal GISTs in China.

84873279963	Incidence and mortality of breast cancer in China, 2008	Background: Female breast cancer incidence and mortality data for the duration of 2008, in China, retrieved from the National Central Cancer Registry, was analyzed. Methods: In 2008, there were 56 registries that submitted cancer registration data. Based on the criteria of data quality, a total of 41 registries' data met the requirement and were accepted for analysis. The incidence and mortality rates of breast cancer in females were calculated, including age specific rates, age-standardized rates, proportions, and cumulative rates, stratified by areas (urban/rural). Results: The number of cases included from 41 registries was 66138784, with 32798187 of these cases found in women (25898251 in urban areas and 6899936 in rural areas). There were 15625 new cases reported and 3414 deaths of women with breast cancer, resulting in a mortality to incidence ratio of 0.22. The morphological verified rate was 91.96%, and 0.43% of cases were identified by death certificate only. The crude cancer incidence rate in all areas was 47.64/100000, and the Age-Standardized Incidence Rates by Chinese standard population, (ASIRC) and World standard population (ASIRW) were 25.26/100000 and 31.71/100000, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) was 3.44%. Both crude and adjusted incidence rates in urban areas were much higher than those in rural areas. The crude cancer mortality was 10.41/100000, and the Age-Standardized Mortality Rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by World population (ASMRW) were 4.90/100000 and 6.48/100000, respectively. The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 years old) was 0.071%. Age-adjusted mortality rates in urban areas were also higher than in rural areas. Age specific incidence rates peaked in age group 50-54 in all areas (108.27/100000) and in urban areas (119.68/100000). It reached the peak in the 55-59 age group for rural women. Age specific mortalities rose with the increase of age for both women in urban and rural areas, with mortality rates of 76.16/100000 and 23.73/100000 in age groups of 85 and above, respectively. Conclusions: Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in Chinese women. Preventative measures, such as health education and screening, are needed in the general population, but especially for those in the high-risk group found in urban areas. © 2012 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84873286644	Lung cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2008	Background: To provide cancer statistics to health planners, researchers, and the public, we reported the incidence and mortality data of lung cancer in 2008 in Chinese registration areas by age, sex, and geographic area. Methods: In 2011, 56 population-based cancer registries reported the lung cancer incidence and mortality data of 2008 to the Chinese National Central Cancer Registry. Forty-one registries' data met the national criteria. The crude incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer were calculated by age, gender, and area. Age-standardized rates were calculated using the Chinese and World populations. Results: The crude incidence rate for lung cancer was 54.75/100000 (73.12/100000 for male and 36.08/100000 for female; 57.96/100000 in urban and 42.80/100000 in rural). Age-standardized rates by China population (CASR) and World population (WASR) for incidence were 24.98/100000 and 34.07/100000, respectively. The crude mortality rate for lung cancer was 46.07/100000 (62.47/100000 for male and 29.39/100000 for female; 48.76/100000 in urban and 36.03/100000 in rural). The CASR and WASR for mortality were 20.09/100000 and 27.68/100000, respectively. Both for incidence and mortality, the rates for lung cancer were higher in males than in females, and in urban areas than in rural areas. The overall age-specific incidence and mortality rates showed that both rates were relatively low up to 35 years of age, but dramatically increased from such age, reaching a peak with subjects of 80-84 years old. Conclusion: The burden of lung cancer remains high in China, especially for males in urban areas. Effective intervention, such as smoking control, should be enhanced in the future. © 2012 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84874822850	miR-181a Regulates Inflammation Responses in Monocytes and Macrophages	miR-181a has been presumed to target the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of IL1a based on software predictions. miR-181a and IL1a have opposite expression levels in monocytes and macrophages in the inflammatory state. This led us to suspect that mir-181a has an important function in regulating inflammatory response by targeting IL1a. Fluorescence reporter assays showed that miR-181a effectively binds to the 3′-UTR of IL1a. The anti-inflammatory functions of miR-181a were investigated in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced Raw264.7 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/LPS-induced THP-1 cells. We found that miR-181a mimics significantly lowered IL1a expression levels in these cells and, interestingly, miR-181a inhibitors reversed this decrease. In addition, miR-181a mimics significantly inhibited increase in the levels of inflammatory factors (IL1b, IL6, and TNFa) in these cells. Furthermore, miR-181a mimics and inhibitors decreased and increased, respectively, production of reactive oxygen species in PMA/LPS-induced THP-1 cells. These results indicate that miR-181a regulates inflammatory responses by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of IL1a and down-regulating IL1a levels. Interestingly, we found that miR-181a inhibited production of inflammatory factors even in IL1a-induced THP-1 cells, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of miR-181a possibly involves other targets in addition to IL1a. Thus, we provide the first evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of miR-181a mediated at least in part by down-regulating IL1a. © 2013 Xie et al.

84874923608	The incidences and mortalities of major cancers in China, 2009	In 2012, the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) of China collected cancer registration information for the year 2009 from local cancer registries and analyzed it to describe the incidences and mortalities of cancers in China. Based on the data quality criteria from NCCR, data from 104 registries covering 85,470,522 people (57,489,009 in urban areas and 27,981,513 in rural areas) were checked and evaluated. The data from 72 registries were qualified and accepted for the cancer registry annual report in 2012. The total cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The morphologically verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of the incident cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/ 100,000 (317.97/100,000 in males and 253.09/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for incidences based on the Chinese standard population (ASRIC) and the world standard population (ASRIW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000, respectively, with a cumulative incidence of 22.08%. The cancer mortality in the Chinese cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females). The age-standardized rates for mortalities based on the Chinese standard population (ASRMC) and the world standard population (ASRMW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000, respectively, and the cumulative mortality was 12.94%. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer, and cervical cancer were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia, and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer registration's population coverage has been increasing, and its data quality is improving. As the basis of the cancer control program, the cancer registry plays an important role in directing anticancer strategies in the medium and long term. Because cancer burdens are different in urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control efforts should be based on practical situations.

84876095226	Esophageal cancer incidence and mortality in China, 2009	Objective: Esophageal cancer incident cases and deaths in 2009 were retrieved from national database of population based cancer registry to describe esophageal cancer burden in registration areas. Methods: In 2012, 104 population-based cancer registries reported cancer incidence and mortality data of 2009 to Chinese National Central Cancer Registry. Total 72 registries' data met the national criteria to bepooled and analyzed. The crude incidence and mortality rates of esophageal cancer were calculated by age, gender and area. China sensus in1982 and Segi's world population were applied for age standardized rates. Results: The crude incidence of esophageal cancer ranked fifth in all cancer sites with rate of 22.14/100,000 (30.44/100,000 for maleand 13.64/100,000 for female, 14.21/100,000 in urban and 38.44/100,000 in rural). Age-standardized rates by China population (CASR) and World population (WASR) for incidence were 10.88/100,000 and 14.81/100,000 respectively. The crude mortality of esophageal cancer ranked fourth in all cancer sites with rate of 16.77/100,000 (23.29/100,000 for male and 10.11/100,000 for female, 10.59/100,000 in urban and 29.47/100,000 in rural). The CASR and WASR for mortality were 7.75/100,000 and 10.76/100,000 respectively. For both of incidence and mortality, the rates of esophageal cancer were much higher in males than in females, in rural areas than in urban areas. The overall age-specific incidence and mortality rates showed that both rates were relatively low before 45 years old, and then gradually increased, reaching peak in age group of 80-84. Conclusions: The burden of esophageal cancer remained high in China, especially for males in rural areas. Effective prevention and control action, such as health education, nutrition intervention and screening should be enhanced in the future. © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.

84877645216	Application of video-assisted thoracic surgery in the standard operation for thoracic tumors	Objective: To evaluate the short-term outcomes of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for thoracic tumors. Methods: The data of 1,790 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed. These patients underwent VATS pulmonary resections, VATS esophagectomies, and VATS resections of mediastinal tumors or biopsies at the Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between January 2009 and January 2012. Results: There were 33 patients converted to open thoracotomy (OT, 1.84%). The overall morbidity and mortality rate was 2.79% (50/1790) and 0.28% (5/1790), respectively. The overall hospitalization and chest tube duration were shorter in the VATS lobectomy group (n=949) than in the open thoracotomy (OT) lobectomy group (n=753). There were no significant differences in morbidity rate, mortality rate and operation time between the two groups. In the esophageal cancer patients, no significant difference was found in the number of nodal dissection, chest tube duration, morbidity rate, mortality rate, and hospital length of stay between the VATS esophagectomy group (n=81) and open esophagectomy group (n=81). However, the operation time was longer in the VATS esophagectomy group. In the thymoma patients, there was no significant difference in the chest tube duration, morbidity rate, mortality rate, and hospital length of stay between the VATS thymectomy group (n=41) and open thymectomy group (n=41). However, the operation time was longer in the VATS group. The median tumor size in the VATS thymectomy group was comparable with that in the OT group. Conclusions: In early-stage (I/II) non-small cell lung cancer patients who underwent lobectomies, VATS is comparable with the OT approach with similar short-term outcomes. In patients with resectable esophageal cancer, VATS esophagectomy is comparable with OT esophagectomy with similar morbidity and mortality. VATS thymectomy for Masaoka stage I and II thymoma is feasible and safe, and tumor size is not contraindicated. Longer follow-ups are needed to determine the oncologic equivalency of VATS lobectomy, esophagectomy, and thymectomy for thymoma vs. OT.

84877652930	Molecular classification of non-small-cell lung cancer: diagnosis, individualized treatment, and prognosis	Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause of premature death among the malignant diseases worldwide. The current staging criteria do not fully capture the complexity of this disease. Molecular biology techniques, particularly gene expression microarrays, proteomics, and next-generation sequencing, have recently been developed to facilitate effectively its molecular classification. The underlying etiology, pathogenesis, therapeutics, and prognosis of NSCLC based on an improved molecular classification scheme may promote individualized treatment and improve clinical outcomes. This review focuses on the molecular classification of NSCLC based on gene expression microarray technology reported during the past decade, as well as their applications for improving the diagnosis, staging and treatment of NSCLC, including the discovery of prognostic markers or potential therapeutic targets. We highlight some of the recent studies that may refine the identification of NSCLC subtypes using novel techniques such as epigenetics, proteomics, or deep sequencing. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878614756	DNA methylation-mediated repression of miR-886-3p predicts poor outcome of human small cell lung cancer	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive types of cancer, yet the pathologic mechanisms underlying its devastating clinical outcome remain elusive. In this report, we surveyed 924 miRNA (miR) for their expressions in the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from 42 patients with SCLC, and found that the downregulated miR-886-3p is closely correlated with the shorter survival of SCLC. This correlation was validated with another 40 cases. It was further discovered that loss of miR-886-3p expression was mediated by DNA hypermethylation of its promoter in both cultured SCLC cells and tumor samples. Moreover, miR-886-3p potently repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of NCI-H446 cell in cell culture via suppression of the expression of its target genes: PLK1 and TGF-β1 at posttranscription levels. Forced upregulation of miR-886-3p greatly inhibited in vivo tumor growth, bone/muscle invasion, and lung metastasis of NCI-H446 cells. This newly identified miR-886-3p-PLK1/TGF-β1 nexus that modulates SCLC aggression suggests that both loss of miR-886- 3p expression and hypermethylation of the miR-886 promoter are the promising indicators for poor outcome of as well as new therapeutic targets for SCLC. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

84878737559	Report of incidence and mortality in China cancer registries, 2009	Objective: The National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) collected cancer registration data in 2009 from local cancer registries in 2012, and analyzed to describe cancer incidence and mortality in China. Methods: On basis of the criteria of data quality from NCCR, data submitted from 104 registries were checked and evaluated. There were 72 registries' data qualified and accepted for cancer registry annual report in 2012. Descriptive analysis included incidence and mortality stratified by area (urban/rural), sex, age group and cancer site. The top 10 common cancers in different groups, proportion and cumulative rates were also calculated. Chinese population census in 1982 and Segi's population were used for age-standardized incidence/mortality rates. Results: All 72 cancer registries covered a total of 85,470,522 population (57,489,009 in urban and 27,981,513 in rural areas). The total new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 244,366 and 154,310, respectively. The morphology verified cases accounted for 67.23%, and 3.14% of incident cases only had information from death certifications. The crude incidence rate in Chinese cancer registration areas was 285.91/100,000 (males 317.97/100,000, females 253.09/100,000), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 146.87/100,000 and 191.72/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) of 22.08%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 303.39/100,000 and 150.31/100,000 in urban areas whereas in rural areas, they were 249.98/100,000 and 139.68/100,000, respectively. The cancer mortality in Chinese cancer registration areas was 180.54/100,000 (224.20/100,000 in males and 135.85/100,000 in females), age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 85.06/100,000 and 115.65/100,000, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) was 12.94%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC were 181.86/100,000 and 80.86/100,000 in urban areas, whereas in rural areas, they were 177.83/100,000 and 94.40/100,000 respectively. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer and cervical cancer, were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases in urban and rural areas. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. The cancer spectrum showed difference between urban and rural areas, males and females. The main cancers in rural areas were cancers of the stomach, followed by esophageal cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer, whereas the main cancer in urban areas was lung cancer, followed by liver cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Conclusions: The coverage of cancer registration population has been increasing and data quality is improving. As the basis of cancer control program, cancer registry plays an important role in making anti- cancer strategy in medium and long term. As cancer burdens are different between urban and rural areas in China, prevention and control should be implemented based on practical situation. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

84879825782	Overexpression of Cdc25C predicts response to radiotherapy and survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery	Biomarker identification is crucial for the selection of patients who might benefit from radiotherapy. To explore potential markers for response and prognosis in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery, we evaluated the expression of cell cycle checkpoint-related proteins Chk2, Cdc25C, and Cyclin D1. A total of 56 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. Pretreatment tumor biopsy specimens were analyzed for Chk2, Cdc25C, and Cyclin D1 expression by immunohistochemistry. High expression of Chk2, Cyclin D1, and Cdc25C was observed in 44 (78.6%), 15 (26.8%), and 27 (48.2%) patients, respectively. The median survival was 16 months (range, 3-154 months), with a 5-year overall survival rate of 19.6%. Overexpression of Chk2 was associated with smoking (P = 0.021), overexpression of Cdc25C was associated with patient age (P = 0.033) and tumor length (P = 0.001), and overexpression of Cdc25C was associated with pathologic complete response (P = 0.038). Univariate analysis demonstrated that overexpression of Cdc25C and pathologic complete response was associated with better survival. In multivariate analysis, Cdc25C was the most significant independent predictor of better survival (P = 0.014) for patients treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. Overexpression of Cdc25C was significantly associated with pathologic complete response and better survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. These results suggest that Cdc25C may be a biomarker of treatment response and good prognosis for esophageal carcinoma patients. Thus, immunohistochemical staining of Cdc25C in a pretreatment specimen may be a useful method of identifying optimal treatment for patients with esophageal carcinoma. © Chinese Journal of Cancer.

84880442780	Clinical outcomes of basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus: A retrospective analysis of 142 cases	Basaloid squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (BSCCE) is a rare and distinctive tumor with no standard treatment. This study aimed to explore treatment in relation to prognosis of the disease. Methods: A total of 142 patients with BSCCE that underwent treatment in our hospital from March 1999 to July 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received surgery, 42 postoperative radiotherapy and 28 patients chemotherapy. Results: There were 26 patients included in stage I, 60 in stage II, 53 in stage III and 3 in stage IV. The clinical symptoms and macroscopic performances of BSCCE did not differ from those of typical esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Among 118 patients receiving endoscopic biopsy, only 12 were diagnosed with BSCCE. The median survival time (MST) of the entire group was 32 months, with 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) of 81.4%, 46.8% and 31.0%, respectively. The 5-year OS of stage I and II patients was significantly longer than that of stages III/IV, at 60.3%, 36.1% and 10.9%, respectively (p<0.001, p=0.001). The MST and 5-year OS were 59.0 months and 47.4% in patients with tumors located in the lower thoracic esophagus, and 27.0 months and 18.1% in those with lesions in the upper/middle esophagus (p=0.002). However, the survival was not significantly improved in patients undegoing adjunctive therapy. Multivariate analysis showed TNM stage and tumor location to be independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, distant metastasis was the most frequent failure pattern, with a median recurrence time of 10 months. Conclusion: BSCCE is an aggressive disease with rapid progression and a propensity for distant metastasis. It is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis via preoperative biopsy. Multidisciplinary therapy including radical esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy should be recommended, while the effectiveness of radiochemotherapy requires further validation for BSCCE.

84880611326	MicroRNA-99a/100 promotes apoptosis by targeting mTOR in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Recently, microRNA-99 family members, such as miR-99a/b and miR-100, have been reported to exhibit abnormal expression in various malignant tumors, but their functions in carcinomas are controversial. In this study, we focused on miR-99a and miR-100, which were determined to be universally downregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and investigated their functions and potential mechanisms of action. The downregulation of miR-99a/100 was validated by qRT-PCR in 101 ESCC surgical tissue samples and in 3 ESCC cell lines. The overexpression of miR-99a and miR-100 via the transient transfection of the corresponding precursor molecules inhibited cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis in the ESCC cell lines. To investigate the molecular mechanism of miR-99a/100-induced apoptosis, luciferase reporter assays and Western blots were performed to demonstrate that the overexpression of miR-99a/100 suppressed the expression of mTOR by directly targeting its 3′UTR in a post-transcriptional manner. Clinically, the decreased expression of miR-99a/100 was associated with worse overall survival in ESCC patients. In conclusion, these results indicated that miR-99a and miR-100 inhibited cell proliferation by suppressing mTOR in ESCC cell lines, and therefore, the miR-99a/100-mTOR signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic target for inducing apoptosis to combat ESCC. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84880647917	Contribution of interleukin-12 p35 (il-12p35) and il-12p40 to protective immunity and pathology in mice infected with chlamydia muridarum	The p35 molecule is unique to interleukin-12 (IL-12), while p40 is shared by both IL-12 and IL-23. IL-12 promotes Th1 T cell responses, while IL-23 promotes Th17 T cell responses. The roles of IL-12p35-and IL-12p40-mediated responses in chlamydial infection were compared in mice following an intravaginal infection with Chlamydia muridarum. Mice deficient in either IL-12p35 or p40 both developed similar but prolonged infection time courses, confirming the roles of IL-12-mediated immune responses in clearing primary infection. However, all mice, regardless of genotype, cleared reinfection within 2 weeks, suggesting that an IL-12-or IL-23-independent adaptive immunity is protective against chlamydial infection. All infected mice developed severe oviduct hydrosalpinx despite the increased Th2 responses in IL-12p35-or IL-12p40-deficient mice, suggesting that Th2-dominant responses can contribute to Chlamydia-induced inflammatory pathology. Compared to IL-12p35 knockout mice, the IL-12p40-deficient mice exhibited more extensive spreading of chlamydial organisms into kidney tissues, leading to significantly increased incidence of pyelonephritis, which both confirms the role of IL-12 or IL-23-independent host responses in Chlamydia-induced pathologies and suggests that in the absence of IL-12/IFN-γ-mediated Th1 immunity, an IL-23-mediated response may play an important role in restricting chlamydial organisms from spreading into distal organs. These observations together provide important information for both understanding chlamydial pathogenesis and developing anti-Chlamydia vaccines. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

84881299614	Postoperative radiotherapy for completely resected Masaoka stage III thymoma: A retrospective study of 65 cases from a single institution	Background: The role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for patients with stage III thymoma after complete resection is not definite. Some authors have advocated postoperative RT after complete tumor resection, but some others suggested observation. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the effect of postoperative RT on survival as well as tumor control in patients with Masaoka stage III thymoma.Methods: Between June 1982 and December 2010, 65 patients who underwent complete resection of stage III thymoma entered the study. Fifty-three patients had adjuvant RT after surgery (S + R) and 12 had surgery only (S alone). Of patients who had adjuvant RT, 28 had three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT)/intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and 25 had conventional RT. A median prescribed dose of 56 Gy (range, 28-60 Gy) was given.Results: The median follow-up time was 50 months (range, 5-360 months). Five- and 10-year overall survival (OS) rates were 91.7% and 71.6%, respectively, for S + R and 81.5% and 65.2% for S alone (P = 0.5), respectively. In the subgroup analysis, patients with 3D-CRT/IMRT showed a trend of improved 5-year OS rate compared with conventional RT (100% vs. 86.9%, P =0.12). Compared with S alone, the 5-year OS rate was significantly improved (100% vs. 81.5%, P = 0.049). Relapses occurred in 15 patients (23.1%). There was a trend of lower crude local recurrence rates for S + R (3.8%) compared with S alone (16.7%) (P = 0.09), whereas the crude regional recurrence rates were similar (P = 0.9). No clear dose-response relationship was found according to prescribed doses.Conclusions: Adjuvant 3D-CRT/IMRT showed potential advantages in improving survival and reducing relapse in patients with stage III thymoma after complete resection, whereas adjuvant RT did not significantly improve survival or reduce recurrence for the cohort as a whole. Doses of ≤ 50 Gy may be effective and could be prescribed for adjuvant RT. To confirm the role of adjuvant 3D-CRT/IMRT in patients who undergo a complete resection of thymoma, a multicenter randomized study should be performed. © 2013 Fan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84883625637	Low-expression of microRNA-107 inhibits cell apoptosis in glioma by upregulation of SALL4	Glioma is the most common highly malignant primary brain tumor. The molecular pathways that result in the pathogenesis of glioma remain elusive. In this study, we found microRNA-107 (miR-107) was downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Our results revealed miR-107 overexpression suppressed cell proliferation in glioma cells, whereas miR-107 knockdown promoted cell growth in MO59K. miR-107 expression induced apoptosis in glioma cells possibly through the increase in Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain (FADD) expression and activation of caspases-8 and -3/7. Moreover, the activity of caspase-8 in miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was suppressed with FADD knockdown. The tumor growth in nude mice bearing miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was blocked through apoptosis induction. Sal-like 4 (Drosophila) (SALL4) level was reduced upon miR-107 overexpression in glioma cells, and the inverse was observed upon miR-107 knockdown in MO59K. Using a luciferase reporter system, SALL4 3′-UTR-dependent luciferase activity was reduced by miR-107 mimics or increased by an inhibitor of miR-107. In SHG44, SALL4 downregulation triggered growth inhibition and activated FADD-mediated cell apoptosis pathway. The caspase-8 activity in miR-107-overexpressing SHG44 cells was suppressed with SALL4 upregulation. Furthermore, primary glioma tumors with low miR-107 expression show elevated SALL4 level. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between miR-107 expression and SALL4 level in clinical glioma samples. Therefore, our results demonstrate upregulation of miR-107 suppressed glioma cell growth through direct targeting of SALL4, leading to the activation of FADD/caspase-8/caspase-3/7 signaling pathway of cell apoptosis. These data suggest miR-107 is a potential therapeutic target against glioma. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884791298	MARVELD1 regulates integrin β1-mediated cell adhesion and actin organization via inhibiting its pre-mRNA processing	Cell adhesion on an extracellular matrix (ECM) participates in cell motility, invasion, cell signal transduction and gene expression. Many nuclear proteins regulate cell-ECM adhesion through managing the transcription of cell adhesion-related genes. Here, we identified MARVEL [MAL (The myelin and lymphocyte protein) and related proteins for vesicle trafficking and membrane link] domain containing 1 (MARVELD1) that could suppress cell spreading and complicate actin organization. Over-expression of MARVELD1 in NIH3T3 cells decreased the expression level of integrin β1 and vinculin, and further led to dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr 397. We also found that MARVELD1 partially colocalized with serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SC35) and interacted with nuclear cap binding protein subunit 2 (CBP20). Finally, we demonstrated that pre-mRNA processing of integrin β1 was affected by MARVELD1. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that MARVELD1 plays a role in pre-mRNA processing of integrin β1, and thereby regulates cell adhesion and cell motility. These studies provide a novel regulatory mechanism of cell-ECM adhesion by nuclear protein in cells. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884548352	Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 is a novel plasma biomarker for the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer	Purpose: Effective biomarkers for the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed. We previously showed that isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is significantly increased in NSCLC tumors. This study aimed to examine the plasma levels of IDH1 in a large patient population to evaluate its effectiveness in NSCLC diagnosis. Experimental Design: The plasma levels of IDH1, CA125, Cyfra21-1, and CEA were assayed by ELISA. Blood samples were obtained from 1,422 participants (943 patients with NSCLC and 479 healthy controls). The samples were randomly divided into a training set and a test set. Receiver operating characteristic and binary logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate diagnostic efficacy and establish diagnostic mathematical models. Results: Plasma IDH1 levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLCs than in healthy controls (P < 0.001). The diagnostic use of IDH1 in lung adenocarcinoma [area under curve (AUC):0.858 and 0.810; sensitivity: 77.1% and 76.2%; specificity: 82.9% and 76.6%; in the training set and test set, respectively] was significantly greater than that of CA125, Cyfra21-1, or CEA (P < 0.001). The model combining IDH1 with CEA, CA125, and Cyfra21-1 was more effective for lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis than IDH1 alone (sensitivity and specificity in the training set: 75.8%, 89.6%; test set: 86.3%, 70.7%). In addition, the plasma levels of IDH1 could contribute to the diagnostic model of lung squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: IDH1 can be used as a plasma biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLCs, particularly lung adenocarcinoma, with relatively high sensitivity and specificity. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

84885453581	Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor is an independent prognostic factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Background: The overall survival of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor. Prognostic predictions in ESCC are usually based on histological assessment of tumor invasion and lymph node metastasis, but a biomarker with better predictive accuracy could be more useful. Because overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been associated with poor prognosis, this study investigated whether EGFR is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of ESCC patients.Methods: ESCC tissue specimens from 243 patients obtained during surgical resection between 1980 and 1997 were retrieved for immunohistochemical analysis of EGFR expression.Results: The data showed that EGFR protein was overexpressed in 187 of 243 (77%) ESCC tissues. Elevated expression was associated with higher pathologic tumor stages (P = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002), and higher Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stage (P <0.0001), as well as poorer disease-free survival and overall survival of ESCC patients (P <0.0001). A multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of EGFR protein was an independent factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.003) and overall survival (P = 0.001) of these patients. Subgroup analysis of patients with stage IIA (UICC 2002) showed that EGFR overexpression was associated with poorer disease-free survival (P = 0.007) and overall survival (P = 0.010) of the patients in univariate analyses.Conclusions: The current study demonstrated that EGFR overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of ESCC patients. However, targeting of EGFR activity using gefitinib or erlotinib could be useful for clinical treatment of ESCC patients. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84886813283	Treatment modality selection and prognosis of early stage small cell lung cancer: Retrospective analysis from a single cancer institute	We evaluated the role of surgery followed by either chemotherapy (ChT) alone or chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (ChT/TRT) versus sequential ChT/TRT in patients with clinical stage I or stage II small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Ninety-six patients received surgery (complete resection) followed by either ChT alone or ChT/TRT (Group I), while 49 patients were treated exclusively with sequential ChT/TRT (Group II). The ChT regimens consisted of either carboplatin/etoposide or cisplatin/etoposide. The total TRT dose was 50-60Gy. For the whole group (n = 145), the median survival time was 54 months, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 48%. The corresponding figures for Group I were 91 months and 57%, respectively, and for Group II, they were 34.6 months and 31.4% respectively (P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed that a Karnofsky Performance Status score ≥ 80 [hazard ratio (HR), 0.281; P = 0.015] and the treatment modality including surgery (HR, 0.503; P = 0.004) were independent favourable prognostic factors for OS. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84887118272	Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression promotes macrophage and glioblastoma cell interaction and tumor cell invasion	Activated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an instrumental role in glioblastoma (GBM) progression. However, how EGFR activation regulates the tumor microenvironment to promote GBM cell invasion remains to be clarified. Here, we demonstrate that the levels of EGFR activation in tumor cells correlated with the levels of macrophage infiltration in human GBM specimens. This was supported by our observation that EGFR activation enhanced the interaction between macrophages and GBM cells. In addition, EGF treatment induced up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in a PKC∈- and NF-κB-dependent manner. Depletion of VCAM-1 interrupted the binding of macrophages to GBM cells and inhibited EGF-induced and macrophage-promoted GBM cell invasion. These results demonstrate an instrumental role for EGF-induced up-regulation of VCAM-1 expression in EGFR activation-promoted macrophage-tumor cell interaction and tumor cell invasion and indicate that VCAM-1 is a potential molecular target for improving cancer therapy. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84889774415	Risk factors for locoregional recurrence in patients with resected N1 non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study to identify patterns of failure and implications for adjuvant radiotherapy	Background: Meta-analysis of randomized trials has shown that postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) had a detrimental effect on overall survival (OS) in patients with resected N1 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Conversely, the locoregional recurrence (LR) rate is reported to be high without adjuvant PORT in these patients. We have evaluated the pattern of failure, actuarial risk and risk factors for LR in order to identify the subset of N1 NSCLC patients with the highest risk of LR. These patients could potentially benefit from PORT.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 199 patients with pathologically confirmed T1-3N1M0 NSCLC who underwent surgery. None of the patients had positive surgical margins or received preoperative therapy or PORT. The median follow-up was 53.8 months. Complete mediastinal lymph node (MLN) dissection and examination was defined as ≥3 dissected and examined MLN stations; incomplete MLN dissection or examination (IMD) was defined as <3 dissected or examined MLN stations. The primary end point of this study was freedom from LR (FFLR). Differences between patient groups were compared and risk factors for LR were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses.Results: LR was identified in 41 (20.6%) patients, distant metastasis (DM) was identified in 79 (39.7%) patients and concurrent LR and DM was identified in 25 (12.6%) patients. The 3- and 5-year OS rates in patients with resected N1 NSCLC were 78.4% and 65.6%, respectively. The corresponding FFLR rates were 80.8% and 77.3%, respectively. Univariate analyses identified that nonsmokers, ≤23 dissected lymph nodes, visceral pleural invasion and lymph node ratio >10% were significantly associated with lower FFLR rates (P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses further confirmed positive lymph nodes at station 10 and IMD as risk factors for LR (P < 0.05). The 5-year LR rate was highest in patients with both these risk factors (48%).Conclusions: The incidence of LR in patients with surgically resected T1-3N1M0 NSCLC is high. Patients with IMD and positive lymph nodes at station 10 have the highest risk of LR, and may therefore benefit from adjuvant PORT. Further investigations of PORT in this subset of patients are warranted. © 2013 Fan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84891724501	Folate receptor-positive circulating tumor cells as a novel diagnostic biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer	The study aims to determine the efficacy and feasibility of a novel folate receptor (FR)-based circulating tumor cell (CTC) detection method in the diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CTCs were collected from 3 ml of blood based on negative enrichment by immunomagnetic beads and then labeled by a conjugate of a tumor-specific ligand folate and an oligonucleotide. After washing off redundant conjugates, the bound conjugates were removed and analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The captured cells were validated as tumor cells by immunofluorescence staining. In the evaluation of clinical utility, the results showed that the CTC levels of 153 patients with NSCLC were significantly higher than the controls (49 healthy donors and 64 patients with benign lung diseases; P <.001). With a threshold of 8.64 CTC units, the method showed a sensitivity of 73.2% and a specificity of 84.1% in the diagnosis of NSCLC, especially a sensitivity of 67.2% in stage I disease. Compared with the existing clinical biomarkers such as neuron-specific enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), cyfra21-1, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC Ag), the method showed the highest diagnostic efficiency (area under the curve, 0.823; 95% confidence interval, 0.773-0.874). Together, our results demonstrated that FR-positive CTCs were feasible diagnostic biomarkers in patients with NSCLC, as well as in early-stage tumors. © 2013 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

84894091673	Comparative study of minimally invasive versus open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer in a single cancer center	Background In order to minimize the injury reaction during the surgery and reduce the morbidity rate, hence reducing the mortality rate of esophagectomy, minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) was introduced. The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative outcomes in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing minimally invasive or open esophagectomy (OE). Methods The medical records of 176 consecutive patients, who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) between January 2009 and August 2013 in Cancer Institute & Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, were retrospectively reviewed. In the same period, 142 patients who underwent OE, either Ivor Lewis or McKeown approach, were selected randomly as controls. The clinical variables of paired groups were compared, including age, sex, Charlson score, tumor location, duration of surgery, number of harvested lymph nodes, morbidity rate, the rate of leak, pulmonary morbidity rate, mortality rate, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results The number of harvested lymph nodes was not significantly different between MIE group and OE group (median 20 vs. 16, P=0.740). However, patients who underwent MIE had longer operation time than the OE group (375 vs. 300 minutes, P <0.001). Overall morbidity, pulmonary morbidity, the rate of leak, in-hospital death, and hospital LOS were not significantly different between MIE and OE groups. Morbidities including anastomotic leak and pulmonary morbidity, inhospital death, hospital LOS, and hospital expenses were not significantly different between MIE and OE groups as well. Conclusions MIE and OE appear equivalent with regard to early oncological outcomes. There is a trend that hospital LOS and hospital expenses are reduced in the MIE group than the OE group.

84894038145	Identification of somatic alterations in stage I lung adenocarcinomas by next-generation sequencing	Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer. Somatic mutations in the early stage of this disease have a tight relationship with tumor initiation and potentially activate downstream pathways that are implicated in tumor progression. In this study, we performed whole genome and exome sequencing of tumor and adjacent normal tissue from 10 patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR (4/10 tumors), BCHE (3/10), and TP53 (2/10) were identified recurrently with validated tumor-specific non-synonymous mutations; and the remaining mutations were specific to individual tumors. Computational methods were used to evaluate the potential effect of non-synonymous mutations on protein function, and putative driver mutation in genes such as SDK1 was predicted. Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological process in gene set analysis using the DAVID database. Copy number amplification at 12q15, which includes MDM2, was identified as a recurrent somatic alteration in 4 of 10 tumors. These findings provided additional information for understanding early-stage lung adenocarcinomas. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84894436700	Hypoxia-induced MIR155 is a potent autophagy inducer by targeting multiple players in the MTOR pathway	Hypoxia activates autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cellular catabolic process. Dysfunction in the autophagy pathway has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases, including cancer. Hypoxia induces upregulation of a specific set of microRNAs (miRNAs) in a variety of cell types. Here, we describe hypoxia-induced MIR155 as a potent inducer of autophagy. Enforced expression of MIR155 increases autophagic activity in human nasopharyngeal cancer and cervical cancer cells. Knocking down endogenous MIR155 inhibits hypoxia-induced autophagy. We demonstrated that MIR155 targets multiple players in MTOR signaling, including RHEB, RICTOR, and RPS6KB2. MIR155 suppresses target-gene expression by directly interacting with their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), mutations of the binding sites abolish their MIR155 responsiveness. Furthermore, by downregulating MTOR signaling, MIR155 also attenuates cell proliferation and induces G1/S cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these data present a new role for MIR155 as a key regulator of autophagy via dysregulation of MTOR pathway.© 2014 Landes Bioscience.

84895174987	Development and validation of clinical diagnostic models for the probability of malignancy in solitary pulmonary nodules	Background: It is critical to develop a non-invasive and accurate method for differentiating between malignant and benign solitary pulmonary nodules. In large sample studies, the effectiveness of the diagnostic prediction model as a tool of assessment of the probability of malignancy is still unclear. The establishment of a diagnostic model based on large samples is needed. Methods: In this study, 3358 patients diagnosed with a solitary pulmonary nodule between January 2005 and March 2013, were enrolled. All patients received surgery for pulmonary nodule resection. Clinical characters, preoperative biomarker results, and computed tomography scan findings were collected. All patients were randomly separated into a training set (n = 1679) and a test set (n = 1679); we used training sets to build a diagnostic model for the malignancy probability of pulmonary nodules, and applied the test set to validate our model, as well as other published diagnostic models. Result: Logistic regression analysis identified 11 clinical characteristics as independent predictors of malignancy in patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule. The goodness-of-fit statistic for the model indicated that the observed proportion of malignancies did not differ from the predicted proportion (P = 0.571). The area under the curves of the receiver operator characteristic curve for our model in the training set was 0.935. Conclusion: As the accuracy of the model was high, we suggest that the diagnostic model can be used as a tool to help guiding clinical decisions, when the clinician cannot make a definitive diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule. © 2013 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84898041689	Challenges to effective cancer control in China, India, and Russia	Cancer is one of the major non-communicable diseases posing a threat to world health. Unfortunately, improvements in socioeconomic conditions are usually associated with increased cancer incidence. In this Commission, we focus on China, India, and Russia, which share rapidly rising cancer incidence and have cancer mortality rates that are nearly twice as high as in the UK or the USA, vast geographies, growing economies, ageing populations, increasingly westernised lifestyles, relatively disenfranchised subpopulations, serious contamination of the environment, and uncontrolled cancer-causing communicable infections. We describe the overall state of health and cancer control in each country and additional specific issues for consideration: for China, access to care, contamination of the environment, and cancer fatalism and traditional medicine for India, affordability of care, provision of adequate health personnel, and sociocultural barriers to cancer control; and for Russia, monitoring of the burden of cancer, societal attitudes towards cancer prevention, effects of inequitable treatment and access to medicine, and a need for improved international engagement. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84898646407	A MicroRNA signature predicts survival in early stage small-cell lung cancer treated with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy	Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive cancers, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying its devastating clinical outcome remain elusive. In this study, we investigated whether microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles can predict the clinical outcomes of SCLC patients. A total of 82 patients with limited SCLC, who were treated with surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, were enrolled in this study. First, we surveyed the expression of 924 miRNAs from 42 SCLC patients to discover survival-relevant miRNAs and develop prognostic models, which were then validated in an independent cohort of 40 cases using quantitative real-time PCR. We found that the miR-150/miR-886-3p signature was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of SCLC patients (p = 0.02) in the training set, and both miRNA expression levels were much lower in the SCLC samples than normal lung samples. The miRNA signature also proved to be a significant predictor of survival in the validation set. Patients with high-risk miRNA signatures had poor overall survival (p = 0.005) and progression-free survival (p = 0.017) compared with those with low-risk scores. These findings retained statistical significance after adjusting for age, gender and smoking status (HR: 0.26, 95%: CI 0.10-0.69, p = 0.007), which suggested it may be an independent predictor of survival. In summary, we developed a prognostic miR-150/miR-886-3p signature and validated expression in an independent dataset of resectable SCLC. These preliminary results indicated that miRNAs may serve as promising molecular prognostic markers and new therapeutic targets for SCLC. Copyright: © 2014 Bi et al.

84898663074	Annual report on status of cancer in China, 2010	Objective: Population-based cancer registration data in 2010 were collected, evaluated and analyzed by the National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR) of China. Cancer incident new cases and cancer deaths were estimated. Methods: There were 219 cancer registries submitted cancer incidence and death data in 2010. All data were checked and evaluated on basis of the criteria of data quality from NCCR. Total 145 registries' data were qualified and accepted for cancer statistics in 2010. Pooled data were stratified by urban/rural, area, sex, age group and cancer site. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and national population. The top ten common cancers in different groups, proportion and cumulative rate were also calculated. Chinese census in 2000 and Segi's population were used for age-standardized incidence/ mortality rates. Results: All 145 cancer registries (63 in urban and 82 in rural) covered a total of 158,403,248 population (92,433,739 in urban and 65,969,509 in rural areas). The estimates of new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 3,093,039 and 1,956,622 in 2010, respectively. The morphology verified cases (MV%) accounted for 67.11% and 2.99% of incident cases were identified through death certifications only (DCO%) with mortality to incidence ratio (M/I) of 0.61. The crude incidence rate was 235.23/100,000 (268.65/100,000 in males, 200.21/100,000 in females), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC, 2000) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 184.58/100,000 and 181.49/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) of 21.11%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 256.41/100,000 and 187.53/100,000 in urban areas whereas in rural areas, they were 213.71/100,000 and 181.10/100,000, respectively. The crude cancer mortality in China was 148.81/100,000 (186.37/100,000 in males and 109.42/100,000 in females), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC, 2000) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 113.92/100,000 and 112.86/100,000, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) was 12.78%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC were 156.14/100,000 and 109.21/100,000 in urban areas, whereas in rural areas, they were 141.35/100,000 and 119.00/100,000 respectively. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer and cervical cancer, were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases in urban and rural areas. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. Conclusions: The coverage of cancer registration population had a rapid increase and could reflect cancer burden in each area and population. As the basis of cancer control program, cancer registry plays an irreplaceable role in cancer epidemic surveillance, evaluation of cancer control programs and making anti-cancer strategy.

84899114122	Prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients with preoperative radiotherapy: Comparison of different cancer staging systems	Background: The 7th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis (AJCC TNM) staging system was published in 2010. Here we evaluate its predictive ability and compare the 6th and 7th editions of the AJCC TNM staging systems in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) with preoperative radiotherapy. Methods: A total of 296 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy between 1980 and 2007 were included. Patients were staged using the 6th and 7th edition staging systems. Survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models. The homogeneity, discriminatory ability, and monotonicity of gradients of the two staging systems were compared using linear trend χ

84899443141	Nickel-exposed workers in China: A cohort study	There are more than 50 000 workers in Jinchuan Group Co, Ltd (JNMC). Since all staff in JNMC are eligible for a medical examination every two years, only 23 484 nickel-exposed subjects who participated in medical examination were included in this study. Their data, collected from June 22, 2011 to September 28, 2012, in a comprehensive epidemiological survey and during medical examinations, permitted an extensive evaluation of the relation between metal exposure, gene, epigenetics and risk of human diseases. Their lifestyle investigation showed that the overall prevalence of current smokers, alcohol drinkers, and tea drinkers was 39.1%, 19.7%, and 55.2%, respectively. The prevalence of hypertension, allergic rhinitis and cholecystitis , the top 3 prevalent diseases, was 11.7%, 11.0%, and 8.9%, respectively. © 2014 The Editorial Board of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences.

84901340289	MiRNA expression profile reveals a prognostic signature for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	In this study, we analyzed the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of 119 paired ESCC samples by microarray and identified a four-miRNA signature that predicted patient survival. The signature derived from the training set (n= 60) had a good prognostic value in the test set (n= 59) and the independent cohort (n= 58), indicating the replicability of its prognostic value. Furthermore, the stratified analysis showed that the signature could predict the survival of TNM stage II and stage III patients, indicating that the four-miRNA signature could help to more accurately predict ESCC patient survival. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84922068082	Genetic landscape of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the deadliest cancers. We performed exome sequencing on 113 tumor-normal pairs, yielding a mean of 82 non-silent mutations per tumor, and 8 cell lines. The mutational profile of ESCC closely resembles those of squamous cell carcinomas of other tissues but differs from that of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation were mutated in 99% of cases by somatic alterations of TP53 (93%), CCND1 (33%), CDKN2A (20%), NFE2L2 (10%) and RB1 (9%). Histone modifier genes were frequently mutated, including KMT2D (also called MLL2; 19%), KMT2C (MLL3; 6%), KDM6A (7%), EP300 (10%) and CREBBP (6%). EP300 mutations were associated with poor survival. The Hippo and Notch pathways were dysregulated by mutations in FAT1, FAT2, FAT3 or FAT4 (27%) or AJUBA (JUB; 7%) and NOTCH1, NOTCH2 or NOTCH3 (22%) or FBXW7 (5%), respectively. These results define the mutational landscape of ESCC and highlight mutations in epigenetic modulators with prognostic and potentially therapeutic implications.
