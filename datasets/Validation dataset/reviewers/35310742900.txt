23344440644	Efficacy of dilute betadine solution irrigation in the prevention of postoperative infection of spinal surgery	Study Design. Prospective, single-blinded, randomized study. Objectives. To evaluate the efficacy of dilute betadine irrigation of spinal surgical wounds in prevention of postoperative wound infection. Summary and background. Deep wound infection is a serious complication of spinal surgery that can jeopardize patient outcomes and increase costs. Povidoneiodine is a widely used antiseptic with bactericidal activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dilute betadine solution in the prevention of wound infection after spinal surgery. Methods. Four hundred and fourteen patients undergoing spinal surgery were randomly assigned to two groups. In group 1 (208 patients), surgical wounds were irrigated with dilute betadine solution (3.5% betadine) before wound closure. Betadine irrigation was not used in group 2 (206 patients). Otherwise, perioperative management was the same for both groups. Results. Mean length of follow-up was 15.5 months in both groups (range, 6-24 months). No wound infection occurred in group 1. One superficial infection (0.5%) and six deep infections (2.9%) occurred in group 2. The differences between the deep infection rate (P = 0.0146) and total infection rate (P = 0.0072) were significant between the two groups. Conclusions. Our report is the first prospective, single-blinded, randomized study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of dilute betadine solution irrigation for prevention of wound infection following spinal surgery. We recommended this simple and inexpensive measure following spinal surgery, particularly in patients with accidental wound contamination, risk factors for wound infection, or undergoing surgery in the absence of routine ultraviolet light, laminar flow, and isolation suits. ©2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

25444489901	Allograft arthrodesis of the knee in high-grade osteosarcoma	Background: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the outcomes of massive allograft arthrodesis in the management of high-grade osteosarcoma around the knee. Methods: The results of 19 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma around the knee, which was treated by wide resection and reconstruction using allograft arthrodesis, were evaluated for a mean length of 7.3 years (range, 3-13 years). The mean age at the time of surgery was 13.3 years (range, 6-27 years). According to the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society staging system, 17 patients were stage IIB and 2 were stage IIIB at presentation. Evaluations were based on the oncologic results, non-oncologic results and complications. Functional evaluation was performed with the Enneking functional evaluation form. Results: Four patients (21.1%) died of their disease; 3 (15.8%) are alive with disease; and 12 (63.2%) are free of disease. Four patients (21.1%) had local recurrence of their tumor at a mean of 23 months postoperatively (range, 9-44 months). The mean time to union of the metaphyseal junction was 24.7 weeks (range, 16-30 weeks) and the diaphyseal junction was 47 weeks (range, 24-78 weeks). The overall complication rate was 31.6%, including 2 (10.5%) infections, 3 (15.8%) allograft fractures, and 1 (5.3%) nonunion. Our mean final functional result was 65%. Conclusion: Due to the high rate of complications in this study, we conclude that allograft arthrodesis should be left as a salvage or "back-up" reconstructive procedure after resection of osteosarcoma around the knee, unless there are special indications for this procedure. We found allograft fracture to be the most common complication. © 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

27744465720	Operative treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures using the small AO external fixation device	Background: A retrospective group study was done to evaluate the effect of the small AO external fixator in the management of acute intra-articular fractures of the distal radius. Methods: Between January 1995 and December 1996, 70 consecutive patients with articular fractures of the distal radius were treated by closed reduction and external fixation with small AO external fixators. The mean age at the time of surgery was 58.9 years (range, 14-87 years). There were 58 Colles' Barton's fractures and 12 Smith's Barton's fractures. The follow-up period was 104 months (range, 92-118 months). Results: All fractures united in a mean of 5.8 weeks (range, 4-10 weeks). At the final follow-up, the average range of motion was 56.3 ± 11.6° in flexion, 58.6 ± 10.7° in extension, 21.5 ± 4.2° in ulnar deviation, 9.1 ± 2.9° in radial deviation, 71.5 ± 8.5° in pronation, and 67.3 ± 9.2° in supination. Compared with the normal side, the average grip force was 87 ± 6%. The overall clinical and functional outcomes, according to the scoring system of Gartland and Werley, showed that 22 patients (31.4%) had excellent results, 36 (51.4%) had good results, 9 (12.9%) had fair results, and 3 (4.3%) had poor results. Conclusion: Closed reduction and external fixation with the small AO external fixator is useful and effective in the management of displaced comminuted articular fractures of the distal radius. ©2005 Elsevier.

33745013653	Can povidone-iodine solution be used safely in a spinal surgery?	Intra-operative incidental contamination of surgical wounds is not rare. Povidone-iodine solution can be used to disinfect surgical wounds. Although povidone-iodine is a good broad-spectrum disinfecting agent, it has occasionally been reported to have a negative effect on wound healing and bone union. Therefore, its safety in a spinal surgery is unclear. A prospective, single-blinded, randomized study was accordingly conducted to evaluate the safety of povidone-iodine solution in spinal surgeries. Ascertained herein was the effect of wound irrigation with diluted povidone-iodine solution on wound healing, infection rate, fusion status and clinical outcome of spinal surgeries. Materials and methods: From January 2002 to August 2003, 244 consecutive cases undergoing primary instrumented lumbosacral posterolateral fusion due to degenerative spinal disorder with segmental instability had been collected and randomly divided into two groups: the study group (120 cases, 212 fusion levels) and the control group (124 cases, 223 fusion levels). Excluded were those patients with a prior spinal surgery, spinal trauma, malignant tumor, infectious spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, metabolic bone disease, skeletal immaturity or with an immunosuppressive treatment. In the former group, wounds were irrigated with 0.35% povidone-iodine solution followed by normal saline solution just before the bone-grafting and instrumentation procedure. However, only with normal saline solution in the latter. All the operations were done by the same surgeon with a standard technique. All the patients were treated in the same postoperative fashion as well. Later on, wound healing, infection rate, spinal bone fusion and clinical outcome were evaluated in both groups. Results: A significant improvement of back and leg pain scores, modified Japanese Orthopedic Association function scores (JOA) and ambulatory capacity have been observed in both groups. One hundred and seven patients in the study group and one hundred and nine in the control group achieved solid union. There was no infection in the study group but six deep infections in the control group. Wound dehiscence was noted in one group 1 and two group 2 patients. A subsequent statistical analysis revealed higher infection rate in the control group (P<0.05), but no significant difference in fusion rate, wound healing, improvement of pain score, function score and ambulatory capacity between the two groups. Conclusion: Diluted povidone-iodine solution can be used safely in spinal surgeries, and it will not influence wound healing, bone union and clinical outcome. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

33746433481	Comparison of two interbody fusion cages for posterior lumbar interbody fusion in a cadaveric model	Although the Brantigan cage and Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) cage have different geometrical characteristics, clinical observations suggest that they are equally effective in restoring disc height and stability across the involved spinal segments. This study was designed to compare their performance as posterior lumbar interbody fusion devices at two levels in fresh ligamentous cadaver lumbar spines (L2-S1). After mounting in a testing frame, the three-dimensional load-displacement behaviour of each vertebra was quantified using the Selspot II Motion Measurement System for; the intact state, posterior decompression, and stabilisation, using a pair of Brantigan or BAK cages across L4-S1, additional stabilisation using Isola spinal instrumentation across L4-S1, and cyclic loading in flexion/extension. In the "cage-only" state, the Brantigan cage did not restore the stability in right axial rotation, whereas the BAK cage not only restored stability in all six directions but also improved lateral bending. After implanting the posterior instrumentation, both groups exhibited similar stability, and cyclic loading did not alter this. Although the Brantigan cage appears less effective than the BAK cage, implantation of posterior instrumentation significantly improves stability and reduces the differences between them. This underscores the need to use posterior instrumentation to achieve a higher initial stability. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33750569374	Is fusion necessary for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine? A prospective, randomized study	STUDY DESIGN. A prospective clinical trial was conducted. OBJECTIVES. To compare the results of fusion versus nonfusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. The operative results of surgically treated burst fractures with short segmental fixation have been well documented. There is no report comparing the results of fusion and nonfusion. METHODS. Fifty-eight patients were included in this study, with the inclusion criteria as follows: neurologically intact spine with a kyphotic angle ≥20°, decreased vertebral body height ≥50% or a canal compromise ≥50%, incomplete neurologic deficit with a canal compromise <50%, complete neurologic deficit, and multilevel spinal injury or multiple traumas. All patients were randomly assigned to fusion or nonfusion groups, and operative treatment with posterior reduction and instrumentation was carried out. Posterior fusion with autogenous bone graft was performed for the fusion group (n = 30), and no fusion procedure was done for the nonfusion group (n = 28). The average follow-up period was 41 months (range, 24-71 months). RESULTS. The average loss of kyphotic angle was not statistically significant between these 2 groups. The radiographic parameters were statistically significantly better in the nonfusion group, including angular change in the flexion-extension lateral view (4.8° vs. 1.0°), lost correction of decreased vertebral body height (3.6% vs. 8.3%), intraoperative estimated blood loss (303 mL vs. 572 mL), and operative time (162 minutes vs. 224 minutes). The scores on the low back outcome scale were not statistically significant for these 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS. The short-term results of short segmental fixation without fusion for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were satisfactory. The advantages of instrumentation without fusion are the elimination of donor site complications, saving more motion segments, and reducing blood loss and operative time. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33846329436	Posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion with autogenous bone chips from laminectomy extended with OsteoSet®	Background: This study was conducted to evaluate posterolateral lumbar fusion with autogenous corticocancellous bone chips from the laminae and spinous processes extended with OsteoSet® Instead of cancellous bone from the iliac crest. Methods: A total of 124 patients who underwent posterior decompression and posterolateral fusion with instrumentation between May 2001 and December 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. The study population comprised 49 males and 75 females with a mean age of 66±9.5 years. In all the patients, corticocancellous bone chips from laminectomy and OsteoSet® were used as the graft material. There was no cancellous bone harvested from the iliac crest. The follow-up period was 28±7.1 months. Results: The overall union rate was 91%, and the average union time was 3.9 months. There were 3 complications, including 2 patients with dura tear, and 1 with deep infection. At the final follow-up, the good and excellent results were up to 83.9%. Conclusion: Graft material from laminae and spinous processes extended with OsteoSet® is reliable and effective enough to replace the graft from the posterior iliac crest. © 2006 Elsevier.

34447635742	Optimization design of thumbspica splint using finite element method	De Quervain's tenosynovitis is often observed on repetitive flexion of the thumb. In the clinical setting, the conservative treatment is usually an applied thumbspica splint to immobilize the thumb. However, the traditional thumbspica splint is bulky and heavy. Thus, this study used the finite element (FE) method to remove redundant material in order to reduce the splint's weight and increase ventilation. An FE model of a thumbspica splint was constructed using ANSYS9.0 software. A maximum lateral thumb pinch force of 98 N was used as the input loading condition for the FE model. This study implemented topology optimization and design optimization to seek the optimal thickness and shape of the splint. This new design was manufactured and compared with the traditional thumbspica splint. Ten thumbspica splints were tested in a materials testing system, and statistically analyzed using an independent t test. The optimal thickness of the thumbspica splint was 3.2 mm. The new design is not significantly different from the traditional splint in the immobilization effect. However, the volume of this new design has been reduced by about 35%. This study produced a new thumbspica splint shape with less volume, but had a similar immobilization effect compared to the traditional shape. In a clinical setting, this result can be used by the occupational therapist as a reference for manufacturing lighter thumbspica splints for patients with de Quervain's tenosynovitis. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2006.

34848916715	Rubber band selection for a dynamic splint for flexor tendon repair - A finite element study	Early controlled movement contributes towards reducing adhesion formation and increases the tensile strength of the repaired flexor tendon. However, few studies have focused on rubber band selection for the dynamic flexion-assist splint. In order to determine the appropriate rubber band, this study conducted finite element (FE) analysis to evaluate the traction force in terms of (1) tendon elongation, (2) tendon excursion, and (3) tendon ultimate force. A 3D finger FE model was constructed to compare the motion analysis for validation. This FE model comprised cortical bone, cancellous bone, cartilage, a volar plate, soft tissue, a tendon, and a pulley system. The single rubber band stiffness of 0.0167 N/mm and double rubber band stiffness of 0.0334 N/mm were chosen for this study. This study indicated that the single rubber band stiffness of 0.0167 N/mm was sufficient to generate a traction force to achieve 3 mm tendon excursion while avoiding greater than 1 mm tendon elongation.

0032849565	AO Fixateur Interne in treating burst fractures of the thoracolumbar spine	Background. A burst fracture of the thoracolumbar junction is an unstable spinal fracture, which is caused by high-energy trauma. There are many methods of treatment, both surgical and nonsurgical, in dealing with spinal burst fractures. The Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) Fixateur Interne (FI) system was introduced in 1985 for posterior spine surgery with a transpedicular screw system. Methods. From April, 1989, through December, 1994, we encountered 42 patients with 42 acute burst fractures of the spine; 26 were male and 16 were female, with an average age of 41.2 years. One fracture occurred on T11, seven on T12, 16 on L1, 11 on L2, one on L3, four on L4 and two on L5. According to the Denis classification, there were eight type A, 23 type B, five type C, three type D and three type E fractures. All of these patients received posterior reduction without decompression, posterior short segmental fixation with AO FI instrumentation and posterior fusion. Results. After follow-up for an average of 66.1 months, all fractures were found to have united with residual back pain in only six patients; five patients, including one with nonunion, had back pain without the necessity of medication, and the other one had occasional back pain that was well controlled by medication. The immediate postoperative Cobb's angle improved by an average of 14.2°, and there was an average loss of 3.3°at final follow-up. All patients were neurologically intact at final follow-up except two patients, who were Frankel D. Seven patients had complications during follow-up; one experienced nonunion, four experienced screw breakage, one had screw pullout, and the other experienced breakage of the connecting rod. Conclusions. From our retrospective study, the outcome of burst fracture of the spine treated with AO FI instrumentation system was satisfactory.

33645761666	Tuberculous spondylitis and pyogenic spondylitis: Comparative magnetic resonance imaging features	Study Design. We retrospectively compared magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of tuberculous (TB) spondylitis and pyogenic spondylitis. Objective. To identify differences between the diseases. Summary of Background Data. Clinical and imaging findings of the 2 diseases are hard to distinguish. MRI may show important differences and aid in early diagnosis and treatment. Methods. We compared 22 MRI parameters in 33 patients with TB spondylitis (average age, 66 years) and in 33 patients with pyogenic spondylitis (average age, 65 years). Results. Seventeen parameters significantly differed between the groups. The most important were local and heterogeneous enhancement of the vertebral body in all patients with TB spondylitis, diffuse and homogeneous enhancement of the vertebral body in 94% of patients with pyogenic spondylitis, vertebral intraosseous abscess with rim enhancement (TB vs. pyogenic, 79% vs. 0%), disc abscess with rim enhancement (9% vs. 64%), and well-defined paraspinal abnormal signal intensity (82% vs. 18%). Conclusions. Most parameters occurred in both diseases. Distinctive findings were a pattern of bone destruction with relative disc preservation and heterogeneous enhancement for TB spondylitis and a diskitis pattern (disc destruction) with peridiscal bone destruction and homogeneous enhancement for pyogenic spondylitis. These MRI parameters may facilitate the differential diagnosis of these diseases. ©2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

4043179914	Idiopathic spinal epidural lipomatosis	Spinal epidural lipomatosis is a rare disorder characterized by the pathological overgrowth of epidural fat and often causes extradural compression which may mimic other spinal disorders. Steroid administration is a well-documented etiology. We report a case of spinal epidural lipomastosis without history of steroid administration. The initial manifestation was bizarre and was misdiagnosed as a degenerative vertebral or disc disease for long. Posterior decompression with debulking of the extradural fat successfully and thoroughly relieved his symptoms. We emphasize the importance of taking this disease into consideration for a markedly obese patient with persisting back pain or symptoms suggesting spinal cord or other spinal neural elements compression.

58149353031	Lateral mass anchoring screws for cervical laminoplasty: Preliminary report of a novel technique	STUDY DESIGN: Preliminary reporting of a group of patients with multiple level cervical spinal stenosis treated with a simple technique using lateral mass anchoring screw and unabsorbable suture line for securing the lamina position after expansive open-door laminoplasty. OBJECTIVE: To develop an improved method for laminoplasty fixation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Laminoplasty is considered the standard procedure for treating multiple-level cervical spinal stenosis with myelopathy. Keys to successful laminoplasty are expanding and maintaining the spinal canal. There are many techniques for maintaining and securing of the expanded spinal canal such as fascial or joint capsule anchoring suture, spacer interposition, allograft, autograft, or miniplate fixation. However, many reports have indicated that these complicated and/or costly techniques are not superior to other techniques. This study reports a simple, reliable technique using a lateral mass anchoring screw for augmentation of laminoplasty fixation. METHODS: Five patients with multiple level cervical spinal stenosis underwent laminoplasty. A unilateral open door technique was done for the lesion level and the elevated lamina was fixed to lateral mass anchoring screws at each level using unabsorbable suture line. RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 14.5 months (9 to 34‰mo). Postoperatively, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score improved from an average of 8.6 (range: 7 to10 points) to 14.2 points (range: 13 to 15 points). The average recovery rate was 67% (60% to 75%). Follow-up computed tomography scans showed the average improvement in anterioposterior diameter at each level of the cervical canal to be about 4.0 to 7.7‰mm. The average open angle at each level was 19.0 to 23.8 degrees. All hinged sides had bony fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is a small series, the preliminary results suggest that this simple lateral mass anchoring screw technique can provide a firm and secure anchor for elevated open lamina in laminoplasty. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77954514637	Comparison of potentials between stem cells isolated from human anterior cruciate ligament and bone marrow for ligament tissue engineering	We have previously isolated and identified stem cells from human anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the differences in proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) formation abilities between bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and ACL-derived stem cells (LSCs) from the same donors when cultured with different growth factors, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1). Ligament tissues and bone marrow aspirate were obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty and ACL reconstruction surgeries. Proliferation, colony formation, and population doubling capacity as well as multilineage differentiation potentials of LSCs and BMSCs were compared. Gene expression and ECM production for ligament engineering were also evaluated. It was found that BMSCs possessed better osteogenic differentiation potential than LSCs, while similar adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation abilities were observed. Proliferation rates of both LSCs and BMSCs were enhanced by bFGF and TGF-β1. TGF-β1 treatment significantly increased the expression of type I collagen, type III collagen, fibronectin, and alpha-smooth muscle actin in LSCs, but TGF-β1 only upregulated type I collagen and tenascin-c in BMSCs. Protein quantification further confirmed the results of differential gene expression and suggested that LSCs and BMSCs increase ECM production upon TGF-β1 treatment. In summary, in comparison with BMSCs, LSCs proliferate faster and maintain an undifferentiated state with bFGF treatment, whereas under TGF-β1 treatment, LSCs upregulate major tendinous gene expression and produce a robust amount of ligament ECM protein, making LSCs a potential cell source in future applications of ACL tissue engineering.

84861518408	Analysis of initial injury radiographs of occult femoral neck fractures in elderly patients: A pilot study	Diagnosis of occult hip fractures by initial radiographs remains challenging in the emergency department. Previously, the gold standard for accurate diagnosis of occult hip fractures was magnetic resonance imaging. This study used initial radiographs obtained in the emergency department to evaluate specific signs and measurements as diagnostic references for occult femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. Initial negative radiographs were reviewed for 2 groups of patients: a group with occult femoral neck fractures (n=16) and a group without fractures (n=32). Reviews of initial radiographs and all imaging studies were performed by a senior orthopedist (C-C.C.) and a radiologist (H-T.W.). Diagnostic signs included lateral, medial, anterior, and posterior signs; measurements included elevation of the fat pad and external rotation of the femur. The prevalence of occult femoral neck fracture was 3.3%. Initial radiographs of occult femoral neck fractures were not routinely negative; 14 (87.5%) of 16 patients with fractures had at least 1 radiographic sign. Using the positive lateral or posterior sign as the diagnostic reference, the sensitivity was 0.875 and the specificity was 0.906. When elevation of the fat pad was ≥1.5 mm, the sensitivity was 0.867 and the specificity was 0.857 for the diagnosis of occult femoral neck fracture. The lateral and posterior signs and elevation of the fat pad ≥1.5 mm on initial radiographs are recommended as diagnostic references for occult femoral neck fracture. These references are clearly defined and may offer important information for all clinicians and radiologists in the emergency department.

84861531803	The role of autologous bone graft in surgical treatment of hypertrophic nonunion of midshaft clavicle fractures	Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the results of treating hypertrophic nonunion of mid-shaft clavicle fracture with a limited contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP) without autologous cancellous bone graft. Methods: From 1995 to 2008, 51 cases of hypertrophic nonunion of mid-shaft clavicle fracture were managed with open reduction and internal fixation by LC-DCP without bone graft involvement. Of these 51 cases, 30 had nonunion after failure of initial surgical treatment (Group 1), and 21 had nonunion after failure of conservative treatment (Group 2). Preoperative and postoperative case management were the same for both groups, with the average follow-up period being 20.4 months (range 18-36). Our study evaluated the radiographic results and functional outcomes of these cases according to the quick disability of arm, shoulder, and hand score. Results: All 51 cases resulted in uneventful unions. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding patient demography, cause of injury, preoperative and postoperative functional scores, length of operation, union time, and duration of hospitalization (. p>. 0.05). Conclusion: LC-DCP fixation is an effective method for treating hypertrophic nonunion of mid-shaft clavicle fracture. Local bone graft is sufficient to achieve necessary union, and autologous bone graft from other sites of the body appears unnecessary. © 2012.

84861810554	Distal linear osteotomy compared to oblique diaphyseal osteotomy in moderate to severe hallux valgus	Background: There are no comparative studies of proximal and distal osteotomy for treatment of moderate to severe hallux valgus. Our purpose was to compare the surgical outcomes of modified proximal Ludloff (oblique diaphyseal) osteotomy with modified distal Bösch (distal linear) osteotomy by a single surgeon in moderate to severe hallux valgus. Methods: This retrospective study included feet with a hallux valgus angle greater than 30 degrees. A total of 30 feet (average age, 64.5 years) underwent Ludloff and 32 feet (average age, 61.1 years) underwent Bösch osteotomy. Both osteotomies were combined with distal soft tissue procedure. Clinical outcomes including AOFAS score and satisfaction rate were compared and radiographic parameters analyzed at 2 years of followup. Results: AOFAS scores were equivalent (p = 0.483), with comparable satisfaction rates in both groups (p = 0.418). The radiographic results including hallux valgus angle (p = 0.026), intermetatarsal angle 1-2 (p < 0.001), sesamoid position (p = 0.008), correction of intermetatarsal angle 1-2 (p < 0.001), and change of sesamoid position (p < 0.001) were significantly better in the Bösch group. Correction of hallux valgus angle (p = 0.308) and shortening of the first metatarsal (p = 0.086) were insignificantwith the numbers available. Recurrence developed in eight feet of the Ludloff group and two of the Bösch group (p = 0.040). Dorsiflexion malunion occurred in four feet in the Bösch group, as compared with one in the Ludloff group. Conclusion: Our study found that distal linear osteotomy was a more reliable reconstruction with equivalent function outcomes than an oblique diaphyseal osteotomy. Additional fixation may be necessary to decrease sagittal malunion in distal Bösch osteotomy. Copyright © 2012 by the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society.

84877761203	Surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the knee joint in elderly patients: A 10-year retrospective clinical study	Septic arthritis is the most rapidly destructive joint disease, but its early diagnosis remains challenging; delayed or inadequate treatment, even by expert physicians, can lead to irreversible joint destruction. Between 25% and 50% of patients develop irreversible loss of joint function, which is especially concerning in elderly patients. To understand the factors influencing the outcome of septic arthritis, the authors reviewed patients aged older than 50 years who had undergone debridement surgery for primary septic arthritis at their institution between 1998 and 2008. Ninety-two patients (92 knees) were enrolled in the study; 14 did not meet inclusion criteria and were excluded from the final analysis. Of the 78 included patients, 7 underwent arthrodesis, 22 underwent total knee arthroplasty, 19 were indicated for total knee arthroplasty for severe knee joint osteoarthritis but did not undergo surgery by the end of this study, and the remaining 30 had no or mild symptoms of osteoarthrosis and did not receive any surgical procedure. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogenic agent (38%), followed by mixed bacterial infection (10%). Several factors negatively influenced the final clinical outcome, including delayed treatment, advanced macroscopic staging made during debridement surgery, performing multiple debridement surgeries, and a larger Lysholm score difference pre- and posttreatment. More antibiotics administered, longer duration of antibiotic treatment, and more pathogenic agents present were also significantly correlated with poor outcome. These findings shed new light on the management of septic arthritis. Accurate diagnoses and effective treatments are important for the clinical outcome of knee joint bacterial infection in elderly patients.

84887299520	Biomechanical comparison of the K-ROD and Dynesys dynamic spinal fixator systems-A finite element analysis	Dynamic spinal fixators, such as the Dynesys (DY) and K-ROD (KD) systems, are designed to restore spinal stability and to provide flexibility. The long-term complications of implant breakage and the biomechanics of the adjacent and the bridged levels using the KD system are still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate and compare the biomechanical effects of the KD system and the DY system. Finite element (FE) models of the degenerated lumbar spine, the DY system, and the KD system were each reconstructed. Hybrid-controlled analysis was applied in the three FE models. The FE results indicated that the KD system supplies the most stiffness during extension and the least stiffness during flexion, in contrast to the DY system. In contrast to the DY system, the KD system increased the facet contact force of the adjacent level, but this system decreased the screw stress on the cranial adjacent disc and the pedicle during flexion. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

84898787316	Population-based epidemiology of postoperative venous thromboembolism in Taiwanese patients receiving hip or knee arthroplasty without pharmacological thromboprophylaxis	Introduction Population-based evaluation on the incidence of postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) has not yet been reported for Asians receiving arthroplasty. In Taiwan, thromboprophylaxis was not commonly applied for patients. The population-based cohort study aimed to investigate the epidemiology, and to determine the risk factors VTE for patients receiving hip or knee replacement without pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in Taiwan. Materials and Methods We retrospectively acquired patients' data from National Health Insurance databases representing more than 99% of about 23 million Taiwanese citizens. The primary outcome was the incidence of composite symptomatic VTE within 28 days after receiving hip or knee replacement surgery. Results During 2002 to 2006, there were 114,026 patients undergoing hip (n = 61,460) or knee (n = 52,566) replacement surgery. The occurrence rate of overall postoperative VTE was 0.44%. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was four in 10,000 patients receiving hip replacement or seven in 10,000 individuals undergoing knee replacement. The weekly cumulative incidence of VTE was persistently rising up to 28 days after surgery. Dramatic increase in risk of post-surgical VTE was associated with prior disease history of PE (p < 0.001 for hip replacement, p = 0.01 for knee replacement) or DVT (p = 0.004 for hip replacement, p < 0.001 for knee replacement). Prior claim of congestive heart failure was an independent risk factor associated with patients receiving knee arthroplasty (p = 0.01). Conclusion Life-threatening PE occurred and increased cumulatively up to 28 days after hip or knee arthroplasty in Asians.

84908138366	Fusion may not be a necessary procedure for surgically treated burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spines	Background: The surgical results of treating thoracolumbar and lumbar burst fractures were reported to be comparable between patients with and without fusion in an intermediate-term follow-up. To our knowledge, no prior report has compared the results of fusion and non-fusion with long-term follow-up. Methods: This study was designed to provide long-term evaluation of patients with a burst fracture of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine treated with short-segment fixation who were randomly assigned to a fusion or non-fusion group. Patients older than sixty years of age at the time of injury and those who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Greenough Low-Back Outcome Score and the visual analog scale for back pain. Radiographic outcomes were focused on the vertebral body height of the injured vertebra, the kyphotic angle, and the regional segmental motion. Results: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the non-fusion group, and twenty-four patients were enrolled in the fusion group. The average follow-up period was 134 months (range, 121 to 161 months). The average preoperative kyphotic angle was 16.4°- for the non-fusion group and 19.5°- for the fusion group. The average postoperative kyphotic angle was 1.5°- for the non-fusion group and 4.0°- for the fusion group. At the time of the latest follow-up, the average kyphotic angle was 13.8°- for the non-fusion group and 14.7°- for the fusion group. The average kyphotic angle between the two groups was similar at all follow-up times. A progressive decrease of the kyphotic angle was significant (p < 0.05) with time, regardless of fusion. The radiographic outcomes were similar between these two groups at all follow-up times, as were functional outcomes. More patients in the non-fusion group underwent additional surgery to remove implants. Regional segmental motion was preserved in the non-fusion group, with a mean motion (and standard deviation) of 4.2°- ± 1.9°. Conclusions: The long-term results of short segmental fixation with and without fusion for burst fractures of the thoracolumbar and lumbar spine were comparable. Regional segmental motion could be preserved without fusion, and bone graft donor site complications could be eliminated.

43049086332	Polymethylmethacrylate augmentation of pedicle screw for osteoporotic spinal surgery: A novel technique	STUDY DESIGN. A retrospective study to evaluate the clinical results of patients with osteoporosis and various spinal diseases treated surgically with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmented pedicle screw. OBJECTIVE. To report a novel technique using PMMA for pedicle screw augmentation in osteoporotic spinal surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Many studies have proved that the stiffness and strength of pedicle screw fixation can be significantly increased when the pedicle screw is augmented with various cements. However, most of those studies were experimental. Clinical reports using those materials for pedicle screw augmentation are rare and a practical and reliable technique for primary pedicle screw augmentation with cement has not yet been established. METHODS. Forty-one patients [23 female, 18 male, mean age 75.1 (50-90) years] with osteoporosis and various spinal diseases underwent spinal decompression and instrumentation with PMMA augmentation of pedicle screw. Pre-and postoperative scores for visual analogue scale for pain and Oswestry disability index questionnaire were analyzed. The screw migration, which is the distance from the screw tip to the anterior cortex and upper endplate of vertebra, was also evaluated immediately after the operation and at the mean 22.3 months final follow-up. RESULTS. Totally 291 of 300 screws were augmented with PMMA. There was neither neurologic deterioration nor symptomatic cement leakage after surgery. The mean visual analogue scale pain score of these patients improved from 9.2 to 1.5 (P < 0.01) and the functional Oswestry disability index score improved from 77.5% to 44.2% (P < 0.01). Kyphotic deformity was improved from average 23.2° to 11.9° after surgery, and to 14.9° at final follow-up (P < 0.01). The average loss of kyphosis correction was 3°. There was no significant screw migration when the screws distances just after operation and at the final follow-up were compared (P > 0.01). CONCLUSION. The presented technique of PMMA for augmentation of pedicle screw is a safe, reliable, and practical technique for osteoporotic patients who also had various spinal diseases and need spinal instrumentation. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

50349097757	Difference in femoral head and neck material properties between osteoarthritis and osteoporosis	Background: Osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are the two most common musculoskeletal diseases found in the aged population. It is of interest to measure and study the material properties of the femoral head and neck of these two groups, and hopefully to offer explanation of the observed phenomenon that most patients suffer from one of the two disorders, not both. Methods: Seven osteoarthritic and seven osteoporotic femoral heads were used for this study. The principal compressive region of the femoral heads were cut to determine the Young's modulus and yielding stress by a material testing machine. Comparisons between these two groups were conducted by using material properties and the properties normalized by individual patient physical parameters, including body weight, body height and femoral head diameter, respectively. The finite element model of femoral neck cuboid in OA and OP were obtained based on the micro-CT-scan cross-section. The intrinsic material properties were calculated from the solid FE models. Findings: The results showed significant differences in density, modulus and strength between the osteoarthritic and osteoporotic femoral heads as measured, with the former having 2-3 times the values of the latter. Femoral head diameter has stronger influence in mechanical properties than patient's body weight and body height. Regarding to bone volume (BV), bone surface (BS), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular number (Tb.N), and true trabecular elastic modulus, the intrinsic material properties of femoral neck with OA were higher than OP. Interpretation: It is still unknown why patients do not suffer from both osteoporosis and osteoarthritis at the same time. Many studies aimed to investigate the mechanical property of two groups. However, individual difference of the femoral head and neck is too difficult to obtain a reasonable comparison between these two groups. This study investigated the two groups more quantitatively and further estimated the factors which influence mechanical properties from a biomechanical point of view. © 2007.

58149184325	Is aggressive surgery necessary for acute postoperative deep spinal wound infection?	Study Design. A retrospective study of the clinical results of conservative treatment of patients with acute postoperative deep spinal infection. Objective. To determine the efficacy of antibiotic only treatment of postoperative deep spinal infection. Summary of Background Data. Traditionally, aggressive surgical treatment combined with antibiotics has been viewed as the gold standard for treating postoperative deep spinal infection. There are, however, disadvantages to surgical treatment including higher treatment cost, multiple anesthesia and surgeries, and the risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality particularly in immunocompromised patients. Although many new antibiotics and new methods of antibiotic treatment have recently become available, the role of conservative treatment using antibiotics alone to treat postoperative acute infection has not yet been determined. Methods. Ten consecutive patients with acute postoperative spinal infection were treated using antibiotics alone. The mean onset of the symptoms of infection after surgery was 15.4 days (range, 5-18 days). Seven patients had purulent wound drainage; 3 had healed wounds without discharge. Bacterial culture of the discharge showed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (1 patient), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative Staphylococcus (4 patients), methicillin-sensitive coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1 patient). One patient had a negative culture. Patients with wound drainage were treated with intravenous vancomycin or teicoplamin for 4 to 6 weeks followed by oral antibiotics (quinolone with/without rifampin) for 1 to 3 months. All other patients were treated with oral antibiotics for 3 months. Results. One patient could not complete treatment because of allergy to antibiotics. Infection was controlled in the remaining patients without surgical intervention and did not reoccur. All wound drainage ceased within 2 weeks. The C-reactive protein level of most patients returned to normal range within 10 weeks. Conclusion. Antibiotic treatment alone may be effective in the treatment of acute postoperative spinal infection when diagnosis is prompt. Aggressive surgery may be not necessary and may be reserved for patients who fail conservative treatment. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

6344262429	Postoperative spinal deep wound infection: A six-year review of 3230 selective procedures	Background. Postoperative wound infection remains a troublesome but common complication after spinal surgery. This study presents the 6-year experience of our surgical team with post-operative deep wound infection in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Methods. Of 3230 selected operations, 72 cases of wound infection were identified. Thirty patients with deep wound infection were reviewed, including 17 men and 13 women at a mean age of 32 years. The pre-operative diagnoses included spondylolisthesis, scoliosis, spinal stenosis, herniated inter-vertebral disc, spinal fracture and adjacent syndrome. Results. In this report, different deep wound infection rates were compared between different operative procedures including (1) posterior decompression with fixation and fusion, 1.15%. (2) simple decompression (laminectomy) and disectomy, 0.37%, (3) revision fixation with decompression, 4.4%, and (4) removal of implant. 0.33%. The onset of infection sign was divided into 3 groups: (1) acute (< 2 weeks), 43.3%, (2) subacute (2-4 weeks), 40%, and (3) chronic (> 4 weeks), 16.6%. In 11 patients with deep wound infection, no bacteria was cultured, while 14 patients had Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and another 3 patients had lower-grade toxic staphylococcus aureus. All patients received debridement followed by delayed wound closure with effective antibiotics. Instruments were removed in only 8 patients. Twenty seven cases were cured after treatment but 3 patients expired in poor condition. Conclusions. In this series, total deep wound infection was 0.9% in our 6-year experience. The incidence of postoperative spinal infection increased with the complexity of the procedure. Most patients got completely disease free with antibiotics and surgical treatment.

62749102864	Treatment of congenital scoliosis with single-level hemivertebrae	Introduction: The natural history of congenital scoliosis with hemivertebrae is unpredictable and the management is also controversial. Materials and methods: Between 1986 and 2004, 22 patients (eight male and fourteen female, mean 19.3 years old) with single-level hemivertebrae related congenital scoliosis underwent non-operative or operative treatment at our institution with an average follow-up period of 8.8 years. Results: Only a 5° curve progression was noted in upper thoracic hemivertebrae after followed up 6 years. By one stage combined anterior hemivertebrae excision, posterior instrumentation, and arthrodesis, up to 61% curve correction can be achieved. Posterior instrumentation, correction and arthrodesis showed a 25% correction. The result of pain relief is promising in skeletal-matured patients. Conclusions: Surgical instrumentation, correction and arthrodesis showed good results. The optimal treatment of choice may differed from one to the other. © Springer-Verlag 2008.

68349158821	A 3D mathematical model to predict spinal joint forces for a child with spina bifida	Children with spina bifida (SB) can exhibit excessive arm swing, trunk sway, and pelvic tilt during walking. To understand the relationship between abnormal low back forces (LBF) and gait disorders in SB, we derived a mathematical model for evaluating LBF in this population. One unimpaired child and a child with SB were tested. A 3D motion analysis system and force plate were used to collect kinematic and ground reaction force data during walking. A mathematical model created using MATLAB software was used to calculate LBF for each child. The LBF for the child with SB was three times greater in the medio-lateral direction than for the unimpaired child. In the anterior-posterior direction, the LBF for the child with SB acted mostly towards the anterior trunk. In addition, the LBF of the child with SB increased by 24.5% of body weight at the fastest walking speed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0034802078	Stress analysis of the disc adjacent to interbody fusion in lumbar spine	After anterior interbody fusion in the lumbar spine, the accelerated degeneration of the disc adjacent to the fusion levels was clinically observed. To understand the stress distribution of the adjacent disc, this study created a finite element model of the lumbar spine from L1-L5 vertebral body. The fusion model modified from the intact model was used to simulate the anterior interbody fusion. Various loading conditions, which included flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion, were applied to the finite element model to study the corresponding stress distribution. From the finite element model calculation, at a lower fusion site or more fusion levels, the stress of the disc adjacent to interbody fusion increased more than upper fusion site or single fusion level under flexion, torsion and lateral bending. Larger stress increase was estimated at the upper disc adjacent to interbody fusion than the lower disc adjacent to interbody fusion. In stress distribution, the upper disc adjacent to interbody fusion had a little alteration under torsion. © 2001 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

77954958028	Soft tissue sarcoma of extremities: The prognostic significance of adequate surgical margins in primary operation and reoperation after recurrence	Background: Adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of extremities are prone to recurrence despite apparently complete resection. This study aimed to explore the impact of clinicopathological factors on outcome and to define an "oncological safe margin" in these patients. Methods: A total of 181 patients with extremity STS were enrolled in a retrospective study. The prognostic influence of margin status and other clinicopathological characteristics on local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS), were examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. The influence of surgical margins on postrecurrence survival (PRS) of patients undergoing reoperation for relapsed lesions during follow-up was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: Surgical margin width <10 mm and deep tumor depth at primary operation were consistently statistically significant independent adverse factors for LRFS, DMFS, and DSS. Patients with liposarcoma or low grade tumors had significantly higher chances of achieving adequate margins. Of 83 patients who experienced recurrence or metastasis, 53 (63.9%) received reoperation for their relapsed lesions. Patients who achieved microscopically negative margins (R0) at reoperation had significantly better PRS than those who did not (P < 0.007). Overall, patients with no recurrences had the best DSS, while relapsed patients receiving R0 reoperation had better DSS than those receiving either non-R0 reoperation or no reoperation at all. Conclusion: Surgical margins prognostically influence survival in both patients undergoing primary surgery and those undergoing reoperation for relapse of extremity STS. In primary surgery, the chance of achieving adequate margin may reflect the underlying aggressiveness of tumors. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2010.

77955453501	Influence of dynesys system screw profile on adjacent segment and screw	Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether different depths of screw placement of Dynesys would affect load sharing of screw, range of motion (ROM), annulus stress, and facet contact force. Summary of background data: In clinical follow-up, a high rate of screw complications and adjacent segment disease were found after using Dynesys. The pedicle screw in the Dynesys system is not so easy to implant into the standard position and causes the screw to protrude more prominently from the pedicle. Little is known about how the biomechanical effects are influenced by the Dynesys screw profile. Methods: The Dynesys was implanted in a 3-dimensional, nonlinear, finite element model of the L1 to L5 lumbar spine. Different depths of screw position were modified in this model by 5 and 10mm out of the pedicle. The model was loaded to 150N preload and controlled the same ROMs by 20, 15, 8, and 20 degrees in flexion, extension, torsion, and lateral bending, respectively. Resultant ROM, annulus stress, and facet contact force were analyzed at the surgical and adjacent level. Results: Under flexion, extension, and lateral bending, the Dynesys provided sufficient stability at the surgical level, but increased the ROM at the adjacent level. Under flexion and lateral bending, the Dynesys alleviated annulus stress at the surgical level, but increased annulus stress at the adjacent level. Under extension, the Dynesys decreased facet loading at the surgical level but increased facet loading at the adjacent level. Conclusions: This study found that the Dynesys system was able to restore spinal stability and alleviate loading on disc and facet at the surgical level, but greater ROM, annulus stress, and facet loading were found at the adjacent level. In addition, profile of the screw placement caused only a minor influence on the ROM, annulus stress, and facet loading, but the screw stress was noticeably increased. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77956647236	Arthroscopic posteroinferior capsular plication and rotator interval closure after Bankart repair in patients with traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability - A minimum follow-up of 5 years	Background: Shoulder joint laxity over anteroinferior and posteroinferior labral-capsular structure in patients with traumatic anterior glenohumeral instability was reported in the previous literature. The purpose of this study was to report our experience in arthroscopic treatment of traumatic anterior-inferior shoulder instability by Bankart lesion stabilisation with rotator interval closure and posteroinferior capsular plication. Methods: From August 2000 to November 2004, 45 patients with traumatic anterior-inferior shoulder instability were retrospectively enrolled. Each shoulder was treated with absorbable suture for rotator interval closure and posteroinferior capsular plication after anteroinferior stabilisation. The assessments were performed using the Rowe score, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder rating scale, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score) and shoulder range of motion (ROM). Results: With the average follow-up time of 77.1 months, all shoulder scores improved after surgery (P < 0.001). The average ROM deficit of the operated shoulders was not significant (P > 0.05) as compared with the healthy side. A total of 42 shoulders remained stable (93.3%) and there were three recurrences (6.6%). All patients without recurrence returned to their pre-injury levels of athletic activity. Conclusions: In patients with anterior glenohumeral instability, arthroscopic stabilisation of anteroinferior capsulolabral structure with rotator interval closure and posteroinferior capsular plication provided a reasonable result without significant loss of ROM at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957982418	Effect of the cord pretension of the dynesys dynamic stabilization system on the biomechanics of the lumbar spine: A finite element analysis	The basic concept of the Dynesys dynamic stabilization system is to reduce the stiffness of the rigid fixation system to allow limited motion at the implanted level and to prevent stress concentrated at adjacent levels. However, the magnitude of cord pretension may change the stiffness of the Dynesys system and result in diverse clinical outcome, but the effects of Dynesys cord pretension remain unclear. Displacement-controlled finite element analysis was used to evaluate the biomechanical behavior of the lumbar spine after insertion of Dynesys with three different cord pretensions. For the implanted level, increasing the cord pretension from 100 to 300N resulted in an increase in stiffness in flexion from 19.0 to 64.5Nm/degree, and an increase in the high stress region of pedicle screw in flexion and lateral bending. For the adjacent levels, varying the cord pretension from 100 to 300N only has a minor influence on range of motion (ROM) of 6%. This study found that alteration of cord pretension affects the ROM within construct but not significantly to the adjacent segment. In addition, use of a 300N cord pretension causes a much higher stiffness at the implanted level when compared with the intact lumbar spine. © 2010 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

78549256375	Manipulation under anaesthesia for frozen shoulder in patients with and without non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus	Manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) has been used to speed up recovery. However, the outcome of frozen shoulder after MUA in patients with diabetes has not been well documented in the past. A higher prevalence of frozen shoulder has been reported in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. In this study, we revealed the short- and long-term outcomes for treatment of frozen shoulders by MUA and compared these results in patients with and without non-insulin dependent DM by adjusted Constant score. The scores showed no significant differences between the two groups at both early and late follow-ups. Our results revealed that MUA for frozen shoulders is a simple and noninvasive procedure to improve symptoms and shoulder function within a short period of time. Even though DM is a predisposing factor to frozen shoulder, non-insulin dependent DM alone does not influence both the short- and long-term outcomes of frozen shoulder. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78649515409	Finite element analysis of the scoliotic spine under different loading conditions	The role of the vertebral body's rotation and the loading conditions of the brace has not been clearly identified in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This study aimed to implement a finite element (FE) model of C-type scoliotic spines to investigate the influence of different loading conditions on variations of Cobb's angle and the vertebral rotation. The scoliotic FE model was constructed from C7 to L5, and its geometry was the right thoracic type (37.4°) with an apex over T7. Three loading conditions included a medial-lateral (ML) and anteroposterior (AP) force with a magnitudes of 100-0, 80-20 and 60-40 N. Those forces were respectively applied over the 6th, 7th and 8th ribs. According to an analysis of Cobb's angle, the 100 N ML force that was applied over the 8th rib could achieve the best correction effect. Furthermore, the ML force was dominant in alterations of Cobb's angle, whereas the AP force was dominant in alterations of the axial vertebral rotation. Additionally, the level below the apex was the most appropriate level to apply the force to correct C-type scoliosis. © 2010 IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

78651366253	Displaced femoral neck fractures in young adults treated with closed reduction and internal fixation	This article describes the effect of closed reduction and internal fixation with 3 different screw configurations for acute completely displaced femoral neck fractures in young adults. From 2001 to 2006, 136 patients (age range, 20-50 years) who had acute unilaterally completely displaced femoral neck fractures were evaluated retrospectively. All fractures were managed with closed reduction and internal fixation with 3 cannulated screws. The follow-up period was 55 months on average (range, 36-90 months). One hundred twenty-two patients were available for final evaluation of union condition and late complication. Twenty-three patients (18.9%) had nonunion, 15 (12.3%) had fixation failure, and 21 (17.2%) had avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The average duration from injury to surgery was 18.4 hours in the union group and 23.3 hours in the nonunion group, with no statistical significance (P=.196). The average duration from injury to surgery was 17.3 hours in the avascular necrosis of the femoral head group and 22.3 hours in the non-avascular necrosis of the femoral head group, with no statistical significance (P=.155). Vertical- and separated-type screw configurations resulted in a significantly higher nonunion rate (P=.001 and P=.0017, respectively) than parallel configuration. The complication rate in treating completely displaced femoral neck fractures with internal fixation in young adults is high, and screw configuration may further affect results.

78651378790	Deep vein thrombosis after total knee arthroplasty in asian patients without prophylactic anticoagulation	Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is an important complication following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the incidence of DVT is generally underestimated due to subclinical or minor symptoms and signs. In Western countries, prophylactic agents against DVT are administered routinely after TKA. However, in Asia, no regular prophylaxis is generally given to patients undergoing TKA. This article presents a prospective study evaluating the incidence of DVT in 724 consecutive Taiwanese patients who underwent TKA without prophylactic anticoagulation therapy. Of these, 328 patients (45.3%) showed positive Homan's sign with calf swelling >3 cm. Ultrasonographic examination revealed the overall incidence of DVT to be 8.6% (62/724). The incidence of DVT was significantly higher in women (P=.035), in patients who underwent bilateral TKA (P=.002), and in patients with a body mass index ≥30 kg/m

79551682830	Trichostatin A inhibits TGF-Β1 induced in vitro chondrogenesis of hMSCs through Sp1 suppression	Trichostatin A (TSA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) known to modulate differentiation of many cells. However, its effect on chondrogenesis remains elusive. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of TSA on in vitro transforming growth factor-Β1 (TGF-Β1)-induced chondrogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The pellet cultures of hMSCs in a chondrogenic medium were exposed to TGF-Β1 and TSA. Quantitative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, Alcian blue staining, and immunohistochemistry staining were used to confirm and compare the differences in chondrogenesis by analyzing the mRNA of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, Aggrecan, and Col2A1), synthesis of chondrogenic proteins and type II collagen, respectively. TGF-Β1 signaling and its downstream targets were determined by western blot analysis. TGF-Β1 led to significant increases in chondrogenic gene expression and the synthesis of chondrogenic proteins. However, TSA significantly decreased chondrogenic gene expression and the synthesis of chondrogenic proteins in a dose-dependent manner. TGF-Β1 increased phosphorylation of Smad 2/3 and Sp1 expression around half an hour after induction. The increase of Sp1, but not Smad 2/3 activation was almost completely blocked by the addition of TSA. The chondrogenic effect of TGF-Β1 was also suppressed by the Sp1-binding inhibitor mithramycin A. Finally, overexpression of Sp1 abolished TSA-mediated inhibition of TGF-Β1-induced chondrogenesis. Our study showed that TSA inhibited chondrogenesis through inhibition of TGF-Β1-induced Sp1 expression. Furthermore, Sp1 could be a useful tool in future studies looking into biological mechanisms by which chondrogenesis of hMSCs can be augmented, especially in the area of clinical application. © 2010 International Society of Differentiation.

79955660421	Fibromatosis stem cells rather than bone-marrow mesenchymal stem cells recapitulate a murine model of fibromatosis	Palmar fibromatosis is a benign fibroproliferative tumor of unknown etiology, with a high rate of recurrence after excision. The offending cells of palmar fibromatosis are myofibroblasts and the cellular origin of other myofibroblasts has previously been reported to be the bone marrow. However, further clarification of the relationship between bone marrow precursors and palmar fibromatosis is required. Stem cells (SCs) are known to exist in various tissues, but whether SCs can be isolated from fibromatosis tissue is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify stem cells from human palmar fibromatosis, and to evaluate the differences in the differentiation and fibrogenic capacities of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and fibromatosis-derived stem cells (FSCs). We found that FSCs had better fibrogenic differentiation potential than BMSCs, whereas BMSCs had better adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation capacities. Treatment with transforming growth factor-β1 increased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin, and types III and I collagen significantly more in FSCs than in BMSCs. An in vivo study further confirmed the results of fibrogenesis and suggested that FSCs can recapitulate the fibromatosis nodule. In summary, their myofibroblastic differentiation both in vivo and in vitro makes FSCs a potential cell source for future applications in murine models of fibromatosis or fibrogenesis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79956034347	Management and outcome of discoid meniscus tears	Purpose: Previous studies on the outcome of surgery for tears to the discoid menisci have reported inconsistent findings. The purpose of this study was to examine the outcome of arthroscopic treatment for discoid meniscus tear by analyzing the factors of gender, the age of patients at time of surgery, average duration of symptoms, discoid type, and tear type. We attempted to identify the risk factors associated with arthroscopic treatment for discoid meniscal tears. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study examined 39 cases, including 42 knees with discoid meniscal tears, treated in our hospital with an average follow-up of 39.7 months between 2001 and 2005. Treatment option consisted of partial resection, complete resection, and partial resection with repair of torn meniscus. Outcomes were classified according to Ikeuchi classification. Results: Details, including the sex, age at time of surgery, discoid meniscus type, tear type, surgical procedure, and outcome, of the study group were analyzed. The overall outcome was excellent in 47.6% knees, good in 21.4% knees, fair in 21.4% knees, and poor in 9.5% knees at the time of the most recent follow-up. Advanced age at the time of surgery, longer duration of symptoms before surgery, and radial tears of the discoid meniscus had a negative influence on the outcome of arthroscopic surgery for discoid meniscal tears. Conclusion: This study provides valuable indicators regarding the risk factors associated with discoid meniscal tears following arthroscopic management. Younger patients fare better than older patients, and arthroscopic surgery for discoid meniscal tears should be performed as soon as possible. © 2011.

0036171846	A biomechanical comparison of posterolateral fusion and posterior fusion in the lumbar spine	Late postoperative complications occurred after posterior fusion and posterolateral fusion as a result of biomechanical alterations. The stress change between the two fusion procedures has not been well reported. To differentiate the biomechanical alteration that occurs with posterior fusion and posterolateral fusion of the lumbar spine, the load sharing of the vertebrae, disc, facet joint, bone graft, and the range of motion were computed in a finite element model. Five finite element models, including the intact lumber spine, posterior fusion, posterior fusion with implant, posterolateral fusion, and posterolateral fusion with implant, were created for stress analysis. The finite element model estimated that the differences between these two fusion procedures were within 7% in stress of the adjacent disc, 3% in force of the facet joint above the fusion mass, and 5% in the range of motion. However, the stress of the pedicle in posterolateral fusion without an implant was at most two times greater than that in the intact lumbar spine under lateral bending. The stress of pars interarticularis in posterior fusion without an implant was also at most two times greater than that in the intact lumbar spine under lateral bending. After the implant was added, the discrepancy between the two fusion procedures decreased but still remained a relatively large difference. Therefore, the largest changes of posterior fusion and posterolateral fusion were in the pars interarticularis and pedicle, respectively.

79960584958	Comparison of a minimally invasive technique with open tension band wiring for displaced transverse patellar fractures	Background: Open reduction and internal fixation with tension band wire is the standard treatment for displaced transverse patellar fractures. Recently, some minimally invasive techniques have been proposed as possible alternative methods. This retrospective study compared a newly reported percutaneous osteosynthesis with conventional open method for the treatment of displaced transverse patellar fractures. Methods: The minimally invasive technique was performed by percutaneous osteosynthesis with modified Carpenter's (POMC) technique, using figure-eight wiring through two-paired cannulated screws under the control of arthroscopy and fluoroscopy. The conventional open surgery was performed with open modified anterior tension band (OMATB) technique. Totally 60 displaced transverse fractures were included in our study. Twenty were treated with percutaneous technique and 40 with open method. Outcome assessment included analysis of radiographic images, range of motion, Lysholm scores, complications, and reoperations. Results: Mean follow-up was 37.3 months. Comparison of POMC and OMATB groups showed statistically significant results as follows: shorter surgical time, 70.4 ± 12.5 minutes for POMC group; greater degrees of flexion, 140.4 ± 6.1 for POMC group; better total range of motion, 139.6 ± 8.2 for POMC group; higher Lysholm scores, 93.6 ± 3.1 for POMC group. Frequencies of total complications and reoperations were significantly lower in POMC group. Conclusion: POMC method was a reproducibly reliable method, offering better functional outcome, lower incidence of complications, and reoperations, as compared with standard OMATB group for transverse patellar fractures.

79960596060	Arthroscopically assisted percutaneous osteosynthesis of displaced transverse patellar fractures with figure-eight wiring through paired cannulated screws	Introduction For treatment of displaced transverse patellar fractures, open reduction and internal fixation is the standard reconstructive method. The role of percutaneous osteosynthesis is still unclear and worth of further investigation. Our hypothesis is that satisfactory reduction and rigid fixation is possible for the treatment of displaced transverse patellar fractures with some percutaneous techniques. Here, we present and evaluate a minimally invasive technique for these patellar fractures. Patients and methods This is a retrospective study. Twenty-one patients with 21 transverse patellar fractures were treated with our percutaneous technique in acute phase. The minimally invasive surgery was achieved by closed reduction and fixation with modified Carpenter's technique, using figure-eight wiring through two parallel cannulated screws under the assistance of arthroscopy and fluoroscopy. The patients were followed up to an average of 38.8 months (range 26-48). Main outcome measurements included radiographic assessment, range of motion, Lysholm scores, complications, and reoperations. Results Radiographically, all fractures healed at a mean of 11.0 weeks (range 9-13). Mean total range of motion of knee joint was 140.1° (range 127-152). Functional assessment of Lysholm scores was 93.9 points (range 86-100). Malreduction, loss of reduction, and infection were not observed in 21 patients. Complications were three cases (14%) of hardware irritation, and needed a second operation for removal. Conclusions Under the control of arthroscopy and fluoroscopy, we successfully treated 21 displaced transverse patellar fractures by percutaneously osteosynthesis. This is a safe and reproducible method for transverse patellar fractures. However, it is not indicated for severely comminuted fractures. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80052072504	Recapitulation of fibromatosis nodule by multipotential stem cells in immunodeficient mice	Musculoskeletal fibromatosis remains a disease of unknown etiology. Surgical excision is the standard of care, but the recurrence rate remains high. Superficial fibromatosis typically presents as subcutaneous nodules caused by rapid myofibroblast proliferation followed by slow involution to dense acellular fibrosis. In this study, we demonstrate that fibromatosis stem cells (FSCs) can be isolated from palmar nodules but not from cord or normal palm tissues. We found that FSCs express surface markers such as CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166 but do not express CD34, CD45, or CD133. We also found that FSCs are capable of expanding up to 20 passages, that these cells include myofibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cells, and that these cells possess multipotentiality to develop into the three germ layer cells. When implanted beneath the dorsal skin of nude mice, FSCs recapitulated human fibromatosis nodules. Two weeks after implantation, the cells expressed immunodiagnostic markers for myofibroblasts such as α-smooth muscle actin and type III collagen. Two months after implantation, there were fewer myofibroblasts and type I collagen became evident. Treatment with the antifibrogenic compound Trichostatin A (TSA) inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of FSCs in vitro. Treatment with TSA before or after implantation blocked formation of fibromatosis nodules. These results suggest that FSCs are the cellular origin of fibromatosis and that these cells may provide a promising model for developing new therapeutic interventions. © 2011 Wang et al.

80051783416	Isolation of mesenchymal stem cells from human ligamentum flavum: Implicating etiology of ligamentum flavum hypertrophy	Study Design.: To demonstrate the existence of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in ligamentum flavum (LF) and their pathogenic role in LF hypertrophy. Objective.: To isolate and characterize LF-derived MSCs and their response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) and trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). Summary of Background Data.: LF is a connective tissue, of which hypertrophic changes induce spinal stenosis. The pathogenic role of TGF-β1 in spinal stenosis has been implicated. TSA has been shown to suppress TGF-β1-induced alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), type I and III collagen synthesis in a variety of cells. MSCs have been isolated from a variety of adult tissues, except LF. Whether MSCs exist in LF and their response to TGF-β1 and TSA is not clear. Methods.: The MSCs from LF were isolated and cultured. Their phenotypic character, linage differentiation potential, and response to TGF-β1 and TSA were analyzed. Results.: LF-derived MSCs have the similar profile of surface markers as bone marrow MSCs. They were demonstrated to have the potential to be differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes. Administration of TGF-β1 stimulated cell proliferation, enhanced the gene expression of type I and III collagen, and increased the gene expression and protein level of α-SMA. TSA blocked the fibrogenic effects of TGF-β1. Conclusion.: The current results demonstrated the isolation of MSCs from LF. The cellular response to TGF-β1 implied that these cells might play an important role in the pathogenesis of LF hypertrophy. TSA, which blocks the effects of TGF-β1, may be a potent therapeutic choice for inhibiting LF hypertrophy. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

80155136816	The prognosis of patients with primary osteosarcoma who have undergone unplanned therapy	Objective: For diagnosing osteosarcoma correctly, a combination of clinical, radiological and histological examinations is required. Erroneous treatment may cause local contamination and systemic seeding in patients. The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes of planned and unplanned treatment for osteosarcoma. Methods: A retrospective review of patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who received appropriate surgical treatment and chemotherapy (n = 134) and those who were misdiagnosed and received unplanned surgery (n = 16) between July 1995 and February 2005. Results: Patients who received unplanned treatment were older (mean age: 29.7 vs. 19.7 years; P = 0.003) and had a smaller mean tumor volume (119 vs. 280 ml; P = 0.015). The 5-year survival rate was not statistically different between the groups. Patients who had unplanned treatment had a higher local recurrence rate (43.8 vs. 17.9%; P = 0.024) and a shorter mean time for recurrence (11.9 vs. 20.8 months; P = 0.036). Furthermore, in patients who underwent unplanned treatment, lung metastases occurred earlier (6.1 vs. 16.2 months P = 0.021) and the final limb salvage rate was less (68.7 vs. 87.3%; P, 0.001). Conclusions: Unplanned treatment for high-grade osteosarcoma can result in failure of local control and earlier systemic metastases. © The Author (2011). Published by Oxford University Press.

80255132751	Brain, the last fortress of sarcoma: Similar dismal outcome but discrepancy of timing of brain metastasis in bone and soft tissue sarcoma	Background and Objective Brain metastasis is a rare but dismal event in sarcomas. However, the pattern of occurrence and the prognostic factors associated with post-brain metastasis survival (PBMS) are not yet well-characterized. Methods Sarcoma patients treated at one institute within 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed and those with brain metastasis were identified. The incidence of brain metastasis was demonstrated by case per person-years and cumulative incidence curves. Univariate factors associated with PBMS were analyzed. Results Among 611 sarcoma patients, 20 (3.3%) developed brain metastasis. Alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) and osteosarcoma were the most common subtypes. Overall, the cumulative incidence was 3.9% at 5 years and 8.4% at 10 years. However, the incidence in STS patients continued to rise up to 10 years after primary diagnosis, whereas it reached a plateau in bone sarcoma patients at 3 years. Median PBMS was 1.67 months. Univariate factors associated with better PBMS included ASPS histology, initial surgical treatment, and brain irradiation for non-surgically treated patients. Conclusion Our study revealed a discrepancy in the timing of occurrence of brain metastasis between STS and bone sarcoma. However, patients with brain metastasis had a poor prognosis, implicating the brain as the last fortress of sarcoma. J. Surg. Oncol. 2011; 104:765-770. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

80455128628	Effects of using a high-density foam pad versus a viscoelastic polymer pad on the incidence of pressure ulcer development during spinal surgery	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-density foam (HDF) pads versus viscoelastic polymer (VP) pads in the prevention of pressure ulcer formation during spinal surgery and their cost-effectiveness. Subjects were 30 patients who underwent spinal surgery for more than 3 hr in a prone position. One side of the chest and iliac crest was padded with HDF pads and the other side was padded with VP pads. An Xsensor® pressure measuring sheet was placed between the pad and the patient. Bilateral chest and iliac crest points were observed for the presence of pressure ulcers at 30 min after the operation. Results showed that a pressure ulcer had occurred at 9 of 120 compression points (7.5% of the total), 30 min after the operation. Risk evaluation showed that female gender, weight <50 kg, and body mass index (BMI) <18 kg/m2 as well as location (the iliac crest) were all risk factors for development of pressure ulcers. The most significant factor was BMI <18 kg/m2. The average and peak pressures measured at the points padded with the VP pads were significantly lower than those padded with the HDF pads. However, there was no significant difference between the VP and the HDF pads regarding ulcer prevention. Because the cost of a VP pad is 250 times greater than that of an HDF pad of similar size, the VP pad should only be considered for use in high-risk patients. © The Author(s) 2011.

83255185733	Are intravertebral vacuum phenomena benign lesions?	We retrospectively reviewed plain radiographs from patients with four different diseases that can cause vertebral collapse: osteoporotic vertebral collapse, spinal infection, spinal metastasis, and multiple myeloma. The objective of the study was to find the percentages of intravertebral vacuum phenomena and vertebral collapse rates in the four groups. The vacuum phenomenon is often observed in osteoporotic compression fractures. However, these phenomena are rarely seen in spinal infection and malignant lesions. Whether the vacuum phenomenon is a benign indicator is not known. We retrospectively reviewed plain radiographs from four groups of patients, including 328 osteoporotic vertebral collapse patients, 317 spinal infection patients, 302 spinal metastasis patients, and 325 multiple myeloma patients. The pattern and occurrence rates of intravertebral vacuum phenomena and vertebral body collapse were analyzed. The occurrence rate of intravertebral vacuum phenomena in patients with osteoporotic vertebral collapse was approximately 18.9%. Only one case of intravertebral vacuum phenomena was observed in patients with spinal infection. Vacuum phenomena were not observed in patients with spinal metastasis. The occurrence rate of intravertebral vacuum phenomena in patients with multiple myeloma was 6.4%. The patterns of intravertebral vacuum phenomena were also analyzed. Intravertebral vacuum phenomena are common in patients with osteoporotic vertebral collapse. Most cases of intravertebral vacuum phenomena are of a benign nature. Moreover, intravertebral vacuum phenomena occur extremely rarely in patients with spinal infection. Such phenomena are also found in patients with multiple myeloma. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

83255187860	Polymethylmethacrylate augmentation of the pedicle screw: The cement distribution in the vertebral body	Many studies have proven that the polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) augmentation of the pedicle screw can significantly increase stiffness and strength of spinal fixation. Some major complications have also been reported. However, there are no reports discussing cement distribution and its morphology in the osteoporotic vertebral body, which is critical in the analysis of the biomechanical strength of the pedicle screw and the risk of cement leakage after pedicle screw augmentation. In this study, we used computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the cement distribution in the osteoporotic vertebral body after PMMA augmentation of a pedicle screw and to analyze the factors leading to cement leakage. Two groups of patients were studied. Group A consisted 25 osteoporotic patients (mean age of 73 years) with spinal instrumentation who had a total of 145 pedicle screws and cement augmentation with biopsy needles. Group B consisted of 23 osteoporotic patients (mean age of 74.6 years) with spinal instrumentation who had a total of 125 cannulated pedicle screws with cement augmentation. All patients had CT evaluation of the cement distribution in the vertebral body after the surgery. The cement distribution in the vertebrae was divided into four zones in the axial CT view: anterior onethird, middle third, and posterior third of vertebral body, and the pedicle. The morphology of the cement distribution around the pedicle screw was defined as scattered type or concentrate type. The leakage pattern was divided to anterior-lateral, posterior-lateral, and canal leakage. The correlations among bone mineral density (BMD), the cement leakage rate, and cement distribution morphology were also analyzed. The results showed that most augmented pedicle screws had cement extension into three of the four zones of the vertebral body (66.3%), followed by two zones (20%), all four zones (11.5%), and only one zone (2.2%). Overall, 123 screws (84.8%) in Group A and 108 screws (86.4%) in Group B had cement concentrate type distribution. The cement leakage rate in Group A is 18.3% and 13.6% in Group B.

84655163191	Clinical outcome and imaging of arthroscopic single-row and double-row rotator cuff repair: A prospective randomized trial	The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical and imaging outcomes of single-row and double-row suture anchor fixation in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with emphasis on analysis of the effect of various tear size on repair integrity. Fifty-three patents were randomized to either single-row or double-row rotator cuff repair at the time of surgical intervention. The clinical results were evaluated by applying the UCLA score and the ASES index and assessing muscle strength in abduction and external rotation with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The postoperative rotator cuff integrity was evaluated by magnetic resonance arthrography at 6-month and minimum 2-year follow-up. We enrolled 27 patients in the single-row group and 26 patients in the double-row group. Statistically, the UCLA score; the ASES index; and muscle strength were significantly increased in both groups after surgery, but there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. At minimum 2-year follow-up, intact rotator cuffs were found in 17 patients in the single-row group and 20 in the double-row group, based on magnetic resonance arthrography results. Overall, there was no significant difference in postoperative structural integrity between the 2 groups at 6-month and 2-year follow-up. In patients with tear size larger than 3 cm, the muscle strength of the shoulder was significantly better in the double-row group. For the final imaging results, regardless of the tear size, there was no difference between the single-row and double-row groups. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair with double-row fixation showed better shoulder strength in patients with larger tear size (>3 cm) in comparison with single-row fixation. However, the imaging results showed no significant difference in cuff integrity in both groups in patients with any tear size at 6-month and minimum 2-year follow-up. Level II, lesser-quality randomized control trial.

84855207826	Effect of the cord pretension of the Dynesys dynamic stabilisation system on the biomechanics of the lumbar spine: A finite element analysis	The Dynesys dynamics stabilisation system was developed to maintain the mobility of motion segment of the lumbar spine in order to reduce the incidence of negative effects at the adjacent segments. However, the magnitude of cord pretension may change the stiffness of the Dynesys system and result in a diverse clinical outcome, and the effects of Dynesys cord pretension remain unclear. Displacement-controlled finite element analysis was used to evaluate the biomechanical behaviour of the lumbar spine after insertion of Dynesys with three different cord pretensions. For the implanted level, increasing the cord pretension from 100 to 300 N resulted in an increase in flexion stiffness from 19.0 to 64.5 Nm/deg, a marked increase in facet contact force (FCF) of 35% in extension and 32% in torsion, a 40% increase of the annulus stress in torsion, and an increase in the high-stress region of the pedicle screw in flexion and lateral bending. For the adjacent levels, varying the cord pretension from 100 to 300 N only had a minor influence on range of motion (ROM), FCF, and annulus stress, with changes of 6, 12, and 9%, respectively. This study found that alteration of cord pretension affects the ROM and FCF, and annulus stress within the construct but not the adjacent segment. In addition, use of a 300 N cord pretension causes a much higher stiffness at the implanted level when compared with the intact lumbar spine. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84855580204	Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors of Ewing sarcoma: A clinical analysis of 12 patients in Taiwan	Background: Ewing sarcoma is extremely rare in people from East and Southeast Asia. Methods: The records of 12 patients diagnosed with primary Ewing sarcoma and treated at our institution from 1997 to 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: There were seven male and five female patients and their mean age at diagnosis was 22 years (range, 12-48 years). Two patients (16.7%) had distant metastasis at diagnosis. The primary tumor sites were the trunk in seven patients (58.3%) and the extremities in five patients (41.7%). Eleven patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by wide excision surgery, and then adjuvant chemotherapy. One patient received only chemotherapy without surgical intervention due to poor cardiac and pulmonary function. At a mean follow-up of 33 months, the2-year overall survival rate (OS) was 45.5%. Distant metastasis was the only statistically significant prognostic factor of OS in our study. The 2-year OS rates of patients with lung metastasis and without lung metastasis were 0% and 42.9%, respectively (p=0.021). The t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series. Conclusion: We confirmed that distant metastases is highly predictive of a poor outcome, and that the t(11;22)(q24:q12) translocation was present in all patients in our series. © 2011.

84856690679	Subsequent vertebral fracture after vertebroplasty: Incidence and analysis of risk factors	Study Design.: A retrospective review and analysis of consecutive patients who underwent single-level vertebroplasty at our institute between March 2002 and March 2006. Objective.: To analyze the risk factors for subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty and to predict the postoperative fracture-free time and rate. The effect of bone cement volume injected was also evaluated. Summary of Background Data.: Previous studies of subsequent fractures after vertebroplasty showed conflicting Conclusions about risk factors. The frequency of refracture also varied, ranging from 12% to 52%. Most new fractures occurred at adjacent levels, with different risk factors identified. No data were available on the effect of injected bone cement volume, and no consensus had been reached as to the optimal cement volume. Methods.: All enrolled patients were treated with single-level vertebroplasty and followed a standardized postoperative care protocol. Data from medical records and radiographs were collected and analyzed. Variables included patient constitutional factors, radiographic parameters, and volume of injected bone cement. Results.: A total of 166 patients (76 men, 90 women) with a mean age of 73.4 years were enrolled in this study. The mean follow-up time was 15.3 months. The overall refracture rate was 38%, with a mean fracture-free interval of 32 months. Both a greater volume of bone cement injected and a greater degree of vertebral height restored contributed significantly to the risk of subsequent adjacent fracture. No risk factor for subsequent remote fracture was identified. A greater volume of bone cement injected was positively correlated with deformity correction after vertebroplasty. Conclusion.: Most subsequent fractures occurred at the adjacent level within the first 3 months. Patient preoperative condition did not help predict refracture. Although a greater volume of bone cement injected when performing vertebroplasty contributed to the risk of subsequent adjacent fracture, it resulted in a greater improvement of kyphosis. © 2012, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84857040577	Functional outcome of surgical treatment for knee osteochondritis dissecans with Herbert screw	Introduction: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) can progress to loose body formation, resulting in a Grade IV defect. Several procedures for managing this problem have been established. Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine whether the prognosis and patient satisfaction after Herbert screw insertion are satisfactory. Methods: We collected eight cases that had been diagnosed to have OCD and had undergone Herbert screw insertion. The outcomes were determined via the preoperative, and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (KOOS). The average follow-up period was 30.1 months. Results: At an average of 30.1 months of follow-up (range, 14-68 months), all of the eight patients completed the KOOS. The KOOS subscale scores for pain (mean, 91.25; range, 80-97), other symptoms (mean, 89.88; range, 82-96), activities of daily living (mean, 92.88; range, 80-97), and function in sports and recreation (mean, 88.25; range, 75-96) were not significantly lower than in the published age-matched control group. Conclusion: We believe that surgical intervention of unstable knee OCD with Herbert screw fixation is an effective procedure, and that unstable OCD should be treated as early as possible. © 2011.

84858340858	Clinical Comparison of Valgus and Varus Deformities in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty Following Midvastus Approach	The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare clinical parameters in preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative categories between valgus and varus deformities in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following midvastus approach. We compared 83 patients (83 TKAs in valgus) with 949 patients (1084 TKAs in varus), with a mean follow-up of 72 months. In valgus deformity, mean age and body mass index at TKA were younger and smaller with more percentage of patellar subluxation. Cutting thickness from distal femur, tibial plateau, and lateral aspect of posterior femur were significantly different. The incidence of lateral release was 10.8% in valgus and 2.1% in varus. Although several significant differences were observed in preoperative and perioperative categories, the postoperative functional results were similarly evaluated by Knee Society knee and function scores. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84859343036	Using finite element method to determine pad positions in a boston brace for enhancing corrective effect on scoliotic spine: A preliminary analysis	Scoliosis, the three-dimensional (3D) deformation of the spinal column, is likely to worsen without early intervention. The Boston brace has been widely used to correct abnormal spinal curvature and prevent deformity progression. However, two-dimensional (2D) X-ray images and an experienced therapist are required for a proper Boston brace to be fabricated. There has been little research on how to determine the pad positions of a Boston brace to yield a better corrective effect on a scoliotic spine. This study uses the finite element (FE) method to determine the optimal pad positions for a Boston brace. The software ANSYS 11.0 is employed to establish an FE model of the trunk and brace from S-shaped scoliosis. After the FE model is validated, fifteen FE models with pad positions rotated in a range of 0 to 30 degrees and translated in a range of 0 to 30 mm are created to investigate the effects on correcting a scoliotic spine. A 3D FE model of a scoliotic spine is established to calculate the corrective effect of a Boston brace. The FE analysis indicates that the brace pad at the rib of the apex vertebra should be rotated 20° posteriorly for the optimal corrective effect. Compared to a traditional brace, the modified brace increases the corrective effect on the thoracic and lumbar spine, and lowers the mean contact pressure of the thoracic pad. Additionally, the comfort of the modified brace is comparable to that of a traditional brace, as measured using the visual analogue scale.

84860118154	Hamstring graft sizes differ between Chinese and Caucasians	Purpose: The use of hamstring tendon autografts for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) surgery has become more and more common. The purposes of this study were to determine whether anthropomorphic measurement correlated with tendon sizes in Chinese patient group and whether tendon sizes in Chinese and Caucasian patient groups differed. Methods: From 2008 to 2009, 100 patients that received double-bundle ACL reconstruction with autologous hamstring tendons were prospectively enrolled. The original lengths and triple-folded graft diameters of the individual semitendinosus (ST) and gracilis (Gr) tendons were recorded and correlated with the anthropometric data (height, weight, body mass index, gender, thigh length, shank length, leg length and bilateral thigh circumference) of the patients. Later, using height for predictions, the original heights of patients were added to the equations previously used for regression models to compare the tendon lengths in different ethnic groups. Results: After stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, the height and leg lengths showed greatest correlation with the lengths of both tendons. The lengths of both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons in Caucasian patients were significantly longer than in the Chinese patients. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that anthropomorphic measurements (height and leg length) correlated with tendon lengths. In addition, Caucasians had significantly longer hamstring tendons than the Chinese patients. Level of evidence: Prospective cohort study (prevalence), Level I. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84862829423	Comparison of the adjacent-level fracture rate between instrumented fusion plus vertebroplasty and vertebroplasty alone in osteoporotic spine	Background/Purpose: Previous study revealed a high incidence of adjacent-level fracture after vertebroplasty. On the other hand, instrumented fusion plus bone cement augmentation of anterior column have been reported to achieve significant sagittal alignment reduction and strong spinal fixation. Our hypothesis is that instrumented fusion plus vertebroplasty can prevent adjacent-level fractures in high-risk patients. Methods: Patients with predisposing risk factor for adjacent-level fracture were included. All enrolled patients were treated with instrumented fusion plus vertebroplasty (IF) or vertebroplasty alone (VP), and a standardized postoperative care and follow-up protocol was followed. Data from charts and radiographs were collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 59 patients (40 women and 19 men) with a mean age of 75.4 years were included in this study: 21 patients (15 females) in the IF group and 38 patients (25 females) in the VP group; the mean follow-up period was 34 months. Both groups were similar with respect to age, gender, bone density, involved level, preoperative visual analog scale, and image parameters. It was noted that a greater volume of bone cement was injected in the IF group. Both groups achieved significant improvement in pain scale and image parameters. The overall adjacent-level fracture was 57.89% in VP group. But no adjacent-level fracture was noted in the IF group. Conclusion: Instrumented fusion plus vertebroplasty and vertebroplasty alone can provide significant image parameters recovery, and visual analog scale score improvement. However, instrumented fusion plus vertebroplasty is effective in prophylaxis against adjacent-level fracture. © 2012.

84862784175	Cerclage wiring in displaced associated anterior column and posterior hemi-transverse acetabular fractures	Purpose: The effects of cerclage wiring in the open reduction and internal fixation of displaced associated anterior column and posterior hemi-transverse acetabular fractures were evaluated. Methods: This is a retrospectively clinical study of such cases where the main surgical strategy was open reduction and internal fixation with cerclage wire and reconstruction plates. Data on 12 cases treated between 1992 and 2011 were collected. The mean follow-up period was 32 (12-132) months. Results: Reduction with a fracture gap of less than 2 mm without articular stepping and solid union was achieved in all 12 cases. Postoperative complication developed in one case of symptomatic arthritis. Excluding the case with symptomatic arthritis, the other cases had good to excellent final D'Aubigne and Postel functional results. Conclusions: Cerclage wiring is very useful and effective in the reduction and fixation of displaced associated anterior column and posterior hemi-transverse acetabular fractures, and supplemental fixation with reconstruction plates and screws is necessary. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863159922	Role of autologous bone graft in the surgical treatment of atrophic nonunion of midshaft clavicular fractures	A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the role of autologous bone graft in treating atrophic nonunion of midshaft clavicle fracture with a limited-contact dynamic compression plate (LC-DCP). Between 1995 and 2008, sixty cases of atrophic nonunion of midshaft clavicle fractures were managed with open reduction and internal fixation with an LC-DCP. The cases were separated into 2 groups to evaluate the effect of autologous bone graft in the enhancement of bone union. In group 1 (n=24), autologous bone graft was not used; in group 2 (n=36), autologous bone graft was used. Pre- and postoperative management were the same in both groups. Radiographic results and functional outcomes according to the Quick Disability of Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score were evaluated. Average follow-up was 25.2 months (range, 24-48 months). No statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups regarding demography and preoperative functional scores (P>.05). Operative time and hospital stay were statistically significant longer in group 2 (P<.001), and donor site pain was apparent in group 2. All 60 patients had uneventful union. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups regarding union time (average, 9.8 weeks in group 1 and 9.2 weeks in group 2) and postoperative functional scores (P>.05). Limited-contact dynamic compression plate fixation is an effective method for treating atrophic nonunion of midshaft clavicle fractures. Autologous bone graft was not needed.

84863722236	Follow-up after primary treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of extremities: Impact of frequency of follow-up imaging on disease-specific survival	Background and Objectives: We explored the impact of frequency of surveillance imaging on disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Methods: Locoregional imaging (LRI) and chest imaging (CI) were used to detect local recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM), respectively. Relapsing patients were retrospectively assigned to more frequent surveillance (MFS) or less frequent surveillance (LFS) groups, according to the median interval for each follow-up modality. Outcome measures included overall DSS (O-DSS), post-LR DSS, and post-DM DSS. Results: We assigned 165 patients to three distinct risk groups according to tumor size (≤5 vs. >cm), depth (superficial- vs. deep-seated), grade (I vs. II or III), and surgical margin (≥10 vs. <mm). Data for 80 patients who relapsed were analyzed. Among 50 high-risk (with all four risk factors) relapsing patients, those in the MFS group for either LRI or CI had better O-DSS (LRI, median 44.07 vs. 27.43 months, P=0.008 CI, median 43.60 vs. 36.93 months, P=0.036), post-LR DSS (median 27.20 vs. 10.63 months, P=0.028) and post-DM DSS (median 13.20 vs. 6.24 months, P=0.031). Conclusion: More frequent follow-up were associated with improved survival in high-risk relapsing patients with extremity STS by providing greater opportunities for adequate reoperation.

OBJECTIVE:: To investigate whether Dynesys spacers with different diameters would alter the distribution of range of motion, disk stress, and facet contact force at the Dynesys bridging level and the cranial adjacent level. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: The Dynesys system is designed to preserve intersegmental motion and reduce loading at adjacent levels, but clinical reports do not support these claims. This system has been shown to be almost as stiff as rigid fixation, which acts to hinder intersegmental motion. Few studies have investigated methods of reducing this stiffness. METHODS:: In the finite element study, a previously validated lumbar spine model was used. Five Dynesys constructs with different spacer diameters (0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 times the original standard size) were implanted into the spine model and bore 4 displacement-controlled loading cases: flexion, extension, torsion, and lateral bending. Resultant range of motions (ROMs), disk stress, and facet contact forces at the bridged level and the cranial adjacent level were compared with the results of a spine model without Dynesys implantation. RESULTS:: The results of ROMs, disk stress, and facet contact forces at the bridged levels were all less than those in the intact spine, except for contact forces at the left facet under lateral bending, facet contact forces at the right facet under torsion, and disk stress under torsion. The results of ROMs, disk stress, and facet contact forces at the cranial adjacent levels were all higher than those in the intact spine. CONCLUSIONS:: The results of the present study show that changing the diameter of the spacers will alter the stiffness of the Dynesys construct. Dynesys constructs with larger diameters behave stiffer under flexion but behave softer under extension, torsion, and lateral bending. Changing the diameter of the Dynesys spacers does not significantly influence the load distribution at adjacent levels. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84864283481	Simultaneous anterior and posterior synovectomies for treating diffuse pigmented villonodular synovitis	Background The current treatment methods for diffuse intraarticular or extraarticular type pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) include arthroscopic synovectomy or staged anterior and posterior open synovectomies. However, it is unclear whether simultaneous anterior and posterior synovectomies achieve local control and recovery of function. Questions/purposes We therefore determined the recurrence rate and function in patients with diffuse PVNS treated with anterior and posterior synovectomies and adjuvant radiotherapy. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all 19 patients with diffuse PVNS involving the knee treated with anterior and posterior synovectomies and adjuvant radiotherapy between January 2001 and November 2007. From the records, we determined local recurrence and Tegner- Lysholm scores. The minimum followup was 42 months (median, 98 months; range, 42-143 months). Results Postoperative MRI revealed residual tumor in five of the 19 patients, although three had no disease progression during followup and had knee scores of 86 to 90. Two patients had recurrences at 6 and 9 months with knee scores of 88 at 42 months and 90 at 68 months. The mean Tegner- Lysholm knee score improved from 59 to 93 points. Mean maximum extension and flexion angles improved from 11° to 2° and from 76° to 127°, respectively. Conclusions Compared with the literature, simultaneous anterior and posterior synovectomies associated with postoperative radiotherapy provided rates of residual or recurrent tumor and knee function recovery comparable to that with staged synovectomies reported in the literature. © The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons® 2012.

84864678037	Extensively porous-coated stems for femoral revision: Reliable choice for stem revision in paprosky femoral type III defects	Between January 1999 and August 2008, ninety-six femoral revisions were performed with extensively porous-coated stems in Paprosky type III femoral defects (89 type IIIA and 7 type IIIB defects). Seven type IIIB defects with a mean canal of 16.5 mm were observed; 6 defects achieved stable bone ingrowth and 1 achieved stable fibrous condition. Average postoperative Harris Hip Score was 92.3±8 (range, 77-100), and all scores improved postoperatively. At a mean follow-up of 65.7 months, 92 stems achieved bone ingrowth, and 1 stem (type IIIB) achieved a stable fibrous condition. Three patients died from causes unrelated to the surgery during follow-up. The most frequent diagnosis for revision of the femoral component was loosening of the cementless stem (53 patients; 55.2%), followed by status after a Girdlestone procedure (21 patients; 21.8%), after total hip arthroplasty with acetabular wear (10 patients; 10.4%), loosening of the cemented stem (7 patients; 7.3%), and periprosthetic fracture (5 patients; 5.2%). The authors performed 65 total hip arthroplasty revisions, 23 femoral component revisions, and 8 revisions of femoral components with cemented liners in patients with well-fixed acetabular shells. Extensively porous-coated stems in femoral revision for Paprosky type III femoral defects provided good mid-term durability.

84864286748	Fusidic acid for the treatment of bone and joint infections caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus	There is a lack of surveillance data on resistance to fusidic acid (FA) in Asia, and no reviews of FA usage for the treatment of orthopaedic infections have been conducted since the year 2000. In this study, we present a systemic literature review of FA resistance in Asia and the clinical use of FA for the treatment of bone and joint infections (BJIs). The in vitro activity of FA against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates remains good, with low (<10%) resistance rates in most Asian countries. FA in Asia appears to be a better oral anti-MRSA agent than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and clindamycin. More than 80 cases of FA use for BJI have been reported since 2000 and the recurrence or failure rate is <10%. There is much evidence supporting the use of FA in combination with other antibiotics (e.g. rifampicin) as an oral treatment following intravenous glycopeptide treatment for BJIs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.

84865337638	No Significant Squeaking in Total Hip Arthroplasty. A Series of 413 Hips in the Asian People	Some studies have reported the presence of audible squeaking in ceramic-on-ceramic total hip arthroplasty (THA), and several factors such as implant malposition or poor soft tissue recovery have been described as the cause. Our purpose was to determine the squeaking rate in the Asian population with a consecutive series of ceramic-on-ceramic THA. From 2003 to 2009, 413 THAs were performed by a single surgeon using a minimally invasive modified anterior-lateral approach. Using both questionnaire and physical examination, no squeaking was identified in any cases with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Complications occurred in 4 patients. The results of this study suggested squeaking phenomenon after ceramic-on-ceramic THA may be eliminated. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..

84865388392	Effectiveness of plate augmentation for femoral shaft nonunion after nailing	Background: Treatment options for nonunion of the femoral shaft fracture after intramedullary nail fixation are controversial. The methods of exchanging an existing nail with a larger-sized nail, dynamization, removal of the nail followed by plating, and bone grafting have all been reported. From those options, exchange nailing seems to be the most popular choice. In our study, we used plate augmentation and bone grafting with retention of the nail. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this method in treating femoral shaft nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail fixation. Methods: Between January 2003 and December 2009, 22 patients who had nonunion after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail for femoral shaft fracture were included in our study. There were 13 men and nine women participants, with a mean age of 34.3 years (range, 17-77 years). The mean period of nonunion after surgery was 20.0 months (range, 7-63 months). The patients were classified into three groups, atrophic, oligotrophic, and hypertrophic. We retained the nail and performed plate augmentation for all patients, with simultaneous autologous bone grafting as indicated. We followed up on all patients with plain film examination, and to assess functional recovery status to determine osseous union condition. Results: All 22 of the patients achieved postoperative bony union uneventfully at a mean time of 22.1 weeks (range, 12-40 weeks). The mean operative time was 105 minutes (range, 60-150 minutes), and the mean blood loss was 340 ml (range, 150-700 ml). All of the patients could walk bearing full weight without pain within 3 months. There were no significant complications such as broken hardware, implant back-out, axial or rotational malalignment, or deep infections. Conclusion: Plate augmentation with retention of the nail with autologous bone grafting may be an effective and reliable alternative in treating nonunion of the femoral shaft fracture after open reduction and internal fixation with intramedullary nail. © 2012.

84865434214	Clinical presentation and pathological features of atypical subtrochanteric fracture after bisphosphonate treatment	In recent years, there have been increasing reports of fractures associated with long-term bisphosphonate treatment. Clinical presentation should be examined carefully because fractures after long-term bisphosphonate treatment present typical symptoms and radiological and pathological Wndings. The unique clinical features of such fractures include prodromal thigh pain and complete absence of trauma. The radiological features include stress reaction of the thickened cortex and transverse or short oblique fractures on plain-Wlm radiography and bone marrow edema on magnetic resonance imaging. Careful surveillance and early preventive internal surgical Wxation must be considered by both orthopedic and non-orthopedic physicians. In this study, we reviewed recent articles on atypical subtrochanteric fractures after long-term bisphosphonate treatment. We also present the case of a 72-year-old woman with this type of a fracture who had been using a bisphosphonate for 2 years. The Wndings at presentation and pathological features of the fracture are discussed, including those of imaging studies, and the treatment administered is described. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84866102373	Minimally invasive strategy for gynecologic cancer with solitary periacetabular metastasis	Tumor with bone metastases to the periacetabulum is rare, and its surgical management is challenging. Instead of wide excision with reconstruction of the hip joint, we used a relatively noninvasive method to manage periacetabular metastasis. Such a procedure for this condition has the benefits of short surgical time, less bleeding, and fewer complications during surgery. Our surgical management of the case reported here included curettage, phenol cauterization and filling of cisplatin-loaded cement in order to reduce local recurrence. After following-up for 2 years, there was no local recurrence and disease progression. © 2012.

84866155960	Results of revision total hip arthroplasty with cementless cups with different coating	Background/Purpose: Revision total hip arthroplasty has become more and more challenging in recent years due to the lengthened lifespan of the patients and greater number of revision total hip surgeries. The hydroxyapatite (HA)-coated cup was reported to reduce the radiolucent line after total hip arthroplasty. However, it was also reported that HA particles increased the risk of polyethylene (PE) liner wear, resulting in osteolysis. Therefore, we wanted to know which cup coating would result in a lower loosening rate and better longevity after revision total hip surgery. Methods: We reviewed a series of revision total hip arthroplasties in our department from 2000 to 2009. A total of 321 patients underwent 374 revision hip arthroplasties with cup replacement. Cases of revision total hip arthroplasty with cup revision caused by aseptic loosening were included in our study. In all, 148 cases fulfilled our criteria and were enrolled into our study. Revision due to aseptic loosening after prior revision surgery was defined as [[lifespan of revision implant??]]<comment>Compuscript: This appears to be a comment left from Elsevier </comment>. We checked the revision rate and implant longevity of HA-coated TRIDENT (Stryker, Mahwah, NJ, USA), porous-coated DURALOC (Depuy, Warsaw, IN, USA) and fiber-metal-coated TRILOGY (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) cups after revision hip arthroplasty. Results: Of the 148 cases, 73 were revised with HA-coated, 32 with porous-coated and 43 with fiber-metal-coated cups. Fiber-metal coating, to a significant extent, had the highest incidence rate and shortest implant survival of the three groups. In terms of high degrees of pre-operative acetabular defects, HA-coating and porous coating preserved more bone stock than fiber-metal coating. Conclusion: HA-coated implants were regarded as beneficial to bone ingrowth after hip arthroplasty, especially with regard to the cup and stem components. Porous-coated cups had similar results. Fiber-metal-coated cups had a significantly higher loosening rate and lower implant survival, especially with large pre-operative acetabular bone defects with Paprosky classifications IIIA and IIIB. Revision total hip arthroplasty with HA-coated or porous-coated cup components revealed better results, greater longevity, and a low incidence of repeated revision, especially in cases with large bone defects. © 2012.

0036947109	Biomechanical analysis of the lumbar spine with anterior interbody fusion on the different locations of the bone grafts	The anterior lumbar interbody fusion is the common procedure in the management of the degenerated disc in the lumbar spine, but the biomechanical behavior of the fused segment would be changed because of the implantation of bone graft at the different locations. To investigate the biomechanical alteration, the study applied the finite element model to undergo the stress analysis. A three-dimensional finite element model of the lumbar spine was established, and modified to the three fusion models consisted of the bone graft at the anterior site, the middle site and the posterior site, respectively. The 12 N m flexion and the 10 N m torsion with pre-load 150 N were imposed on the L1 vertebral body. The results of the finite element model indicated that placing bone graft at anterior site could effectively resist flexion moment, and decreased the tensile force of the posterior ligaments about 15% above. Placing bone graft at posterior site could resist torsional moment, and also led to none of contact force of the facet joint in the fused segment. However, wherever the bone grafts were placed, stress slightly increased on the disc adjacent to interbody fusion about 5% below.

84867540703	Fixation strength of PMMA-augmented pedicle screws after depth adjustment in a synthetic bone model of osteoporosis	The purpose of this study was to determine the change of fixation strength after adjusting the height of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-augmented pedicle screws. Cement-augmented cannulated pedicle screws with or without PMMA augmentation with a radial hole in the distal third of the screw thread were inserted into synthetic bone blocks used to model osteoporosis. Screws were left unchanged (in situ), screwed in 3 threads, or screwed out 3 threads. The change in screw height was made 24 hours after cement placement. Radiographs of the samples were taken before and after screw adjustment, and pullout strength testing was performed. In the cement group, a radiolucent cavity was present after screwing in due to the screw-cement complex migrating downward, whereas no obvious change in the bone-cement complex existed after screwing out. Mean pullout strength was significantly higher in the groups with cement as compared to those without cement. However, in the cement groups, the screw-in group had the lowest mean pullout strength among 3 groups, and the mean pullout strength in the screw-out group was also significantly lower than that in the in situ group (P<.05). Adjustment of pedicle screw height after cement augmentation in a severely osteoporotic spine can significantly reduce the pullout strength of the screw.

84867573010	Bilateral stress fractures of the ulna in a young adolescent	We present a case of bilateral ulnar stress fractures in a young male adolescent (15 years old) due to honour guard training and discuss the possible mechanism of this injury. In addition to acquisition of medical history, physical examination and plain radiography, we performed MRI to exclude pathological causes and confirm the plain radiographic findings, indicating stress reactions. Ulnar stress fractures are bone injuries caused by repetitive muscle pull and the reaction of supporting tissues. In honour guard training, the acceleration due to gravity and chronic torsional stress may also contribute to overloading. Thus, such fractures are best managed by avoiding overloading. In addition, we review the literature on stress fractures of the ulnar shaft to map this special kind of fracture. Copyright © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84869490887	Joint replacement in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients	Background: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are at risk for bacterial and opportunistic infections with worsening immunosuppression. Methods: From June 2000 to January 2009, six patients who were diagnosed with HIV infection underwent 10 joint replacement procedures, including six total hip arthroplasties, two total knee arthroplasties, and one shoulder hemiarthroplasty. An ordinary dose of postsurgical-empirical antibiotics was prescribed, with an average follow-up period of 38.6 months. All prostheses of total knee arthroplasty and shoulder hemiarthroplasty were fixed with vancomycin-impregnated bone cement. Results: The rate of postoperative infection for HIV infected patients is supposed to be higher than for HIV negative patients. However, in our institution, there have been no HIV- positive patients who have suffered postoperative infection. Conclusion: HIV-positive patients can have excellent outcomes after undergoing various arthroplastic surgeries. This revelation, coupled with the advances in antiviral therapy that have helped to lengthen HIV patient lifespans, strongly suggests that these patients should receive arthroplastic surgery. © 2012.

84869126837	Rotator cuff tears in patients younger than 50 years of age	The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of rotator cuff tears and the clinical outcome of rotator cuff repair in patients under 50 years of age. Sixty-eight patients (72 shoulders) aged < 50 years, who underwent repair of rotator cuff tears were evaluated. We analyzed the cause of injury, tear size, time from symptom onset to surgery, and rate that patients returned to previous jobs and sports. Postoperative results were assessed by pain, strength, range of motion, and UCLA scoring system. Most of the injuries were caused by an unambiguous traumatic event. The tear size generally was medium or large, while the time from symptom onset to surgery was shorter than that seen in a mixed population. The postoperative outcomes generally were good to excellent, and the rate that patients returned to previous jobs and sports was high. The findings suggest that a good outcome after early repair in younger patients with traumatic rotator cuff tears can be expected. © 2012, Acta Orthopædica Belgica.

84870939026	Surgical results of long posterior fixation with short fusion in the treatment of pyogenic spondylodiscitis of the thoracic and lumbar spine: A retrospective study	Study Design. A single-institution, single-surgeon retrospective review. Objective. To evaluate the clinical results of long posterior instrumentation with short posterior or posterolateral fusion for pyogenic spondylodiscitis of the thoracic and lumbar spine retrospectively. Summary of Background Data. There are controversies concerning the optimal treatment for pyogenic spondylodiscitis, in terms of approach, grafting, and instrumentation. Reports of long posterior fixation with short fusion without debridement of infected tissue for pyogenic spondylodiscitis are rare. Methods. From June 1997 to June 2007, 48 patients with pyogenic spondylodiscitis were treated. The indications for surgery were neurological compromise, significant vertebral body destruction with kyphosis and segmental instability, failure of medical treatment, and the need for tissue diagnosis. All patients received long posterior instrumentation with or without posterior decompression, depending on whether the patients had neurological deficit. During operation, no debridement of infected tissue was done. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the criteria of Kirkaldy-Willis and the visual analogue scale for pain. The neurological outcome was graded using Frankel grading system. Segmental kyphotic angle and fusion were recorded and analyzed. Results. The average follow-up time was 64 months. The visual analogue scale scores improved from an average of 7.2 before surgery to 2.2 after surgery. Twenty-eight patients with initial neurological impairment had an average improvement of 1.03 grades, using the Frankel grading system, at the final follow-up. The segmental kyphotic deformity improved by an average of 8.5° immediately after operation and lost an average correction of 3.0° at the final follow-up. No relapse of infection was found among these 48 patients. Conclusion. The posterior approach with long segmental fixation and short posterior or posterolateral fusion without debridement of the infected tissue was effective for pyogenic spondylodiscitis of the thoracic and lumbar spine.

84872688582	Osteoblastoma in the region of the hip	Osteoblastoma occurring in the region of the hip is very rare, and vague symptoms with uncharacteristic radiographic features often lead to misdiagnosis. Because of radiographic and histological similarities, it must be carefully distinguished from osteoid osteoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, giant cell tumor, and osteosarcoma. Computed tomography is the preferred imaging modality as it is able to detect the nidus and images will not exhibit the flare phenomenon caused by surrounding inflammation seen with magnetic resonance imaging. For hip joint lesions in weight-bearing areas, intralesional curettage may achieve satisfactory outcomes as compared with wide resection. We herein report two cases of osteoblastoma in the hip region in which diagnosis was delayed that were successfully treated with curettage and followed by high-speed burring. © 2012.

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the clinical course of and the results in noncemented THA for ONFH in elderly patients. Between 1998 and 2007, one hundred seven consecutive hips with ONFH in 103 patients were evaluated. The causes of ONFH were traumatic in 46 (43%) hips and nontraumatic in 61 (57%) hips. All hips were treated with noncemented THA. Average follow-up was 72 months (range, 60-144 months). The functional results improved to statistical significance after THA. However, no significant differences existed between 6 months, 1 year, and 5 years postoperatively. Nine (8.4%) postoperative complications occurred in these 107 hips, including 1 stem loosening, 1 liner wearing, 4 postoperative infections, 2 postoperative dislocations, and 1 pulmonary embolism. Fifteen (14.6%) deaths occurred during follow-up. The progression of ONFH in elderly patients was so rapid and the result of core decompression was so poor that a salvage procedure seemed to have no role in the treatment. Harris Hip Score, Short Form 36 physical function score, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index scores significantly improved after noncemented THA. Ninety-two hips had a complete follow-up, and the survivorship of prosthesis was 95% (88/92) with minimal 5-year follow-up. Noncemented THA was effective in the treatment of ONFH in this group of patients.

84875374293	Thigh pain after total knee arthroplasty: Analysis of risk factors	Introduction: Thigh pain may sometimes occur following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The existence of thigh pain can interfere with postoperative rehabilitation and result in an unpleasant postoperative period. Our aim is to identify the risk factors of post-TKA thigh pain. Although the application of a pneumatic tourniquet is common while performing a TKA, it seems to play a role in the development of post-TKA thigh pain. In addition to the use of a tourniquet, some patient factors may also be associated with the occurrence of thigh pain after TKA. Therefore, we hypothesized that some factors correlated to post-TKA thigh pain exist. Materials and methods: During 2011-2012, we conducted a prospective cohort study enrolling 347 patients (with 411 cases of primary TKA) in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. There were 283 cases of unilateral and 64 cases of bilateral knee arthroplasty, respectively. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon. Thigh pain was measured according to the patients' response to the " squeeze test" on the next day after surgery, performed by a single technician. Thigh pain after surgery developed in 33 out of 411 cases of primary TKA. We analyzed the correlation between thigh pain and several possible risk factors, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), tourniquet time, blood pressure, tourniquet pressure, thigh circumference, and use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), using a generalized estimating equation, with SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results: The study consisted of 77 male (22%) and 270 female (78%) patients. The mean age of the patients was 72.2 years (range, 29-89 years). The mean tourniquet time was 35.3 minutes and mean cuff pressure was 268.8 mmHg. Higher diastolic blood pressure and higher tourniquet pressure correlated to thigh pain, which achieved statistical significance. Age, gender, BMI, PCA use, and tourniquet time were found to have no significant influences on the occurrence of thigh pain. Discussion: In this study, higher diastolic blood pressure and higher tourniquet pressure were found to have a correlation with thigh pain. Tissue ischemia and reperfusion may explain this finding. Tourniquet time seemed irrelevant, the reason for which might be attributed to the short tourniquet time in our study. In conclusion, factors that influence post-TKA thigh pain exist. © 2013.

84875814231	Body mass index and active range of motion exercise treatment after intra-articular injection in adhesive capsulitis	Background: Adhesive capsulitis is commonly associated with medical diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, and obesity. Intra-articular injection has been used to speed recovery and relieve pain associated with frozen shoulder. In this study, we evaluated and compared the effects of an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and lidocaine in the treatment of primary adhesive capsulitis in overweight and normal-weight patients. Methods: This is a prospective clinical study of patients with adhesive capsulitis, in which the main treatment strategy was an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid (3 mL) and lidocaine (3 mL). Active range of motion exercise was initiated immediately after the injection and performed four times daily. The evaluation included the recording of a detailed medical and orthopedic history, and the assessment of pain and function by determining the Constant score at baseline (before injection) and every 2 weeks thereafter.

84876968006	Subtalar distraction arthrodesis using fresh-frozen allogeneic femoral head augmented with local autograft	Background: Tricortical autograft has been commonly used in subtalar distraction arthrodesis (SDA) for severe calcaneal malunion. Structural allograft enriched with orthobiological agents is an alternative. This study was performed to evaluate the results of SDA using fresh-frozen allogeneic femoral head without the addition of orthobiological agents. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 15 consecutive SDA procedures (13 patients) with allogeneic femoral head augmented with local autograft for the treatment of severe calcaneal malunion. Clinical outcome was evaluated with the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot score, visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, Short Form-12 (SF-12), range of motion (ROM) of the ankle joint, and patient satisfaction rate. Radiographic assessment included the talar declination angle (TDA), calcaneal inclination angle (CIA), lateral talocalcaneal angle (LTCA), heel height, calcaneal length, and union time. Results: At a median follow-up of 36.0 months (range, 24-47 months), all 15 feet (100%) achieved union, at a median of 13.0 weeks (range, 12-18 weeks). The AOFAS score and VAS pain score improved significantly, with a satisfaction rate of 93.3%. The TDA, CIA, LTCA, and heel height improved significantly. The median increase in heel height was 8.6 mm (range, 1.9-20.1 mm). There was a significant reduction in calcaneal length. Complications included 1 varus malalignment, 1 complex regional pain syndrome, 1 hardware irritation, and 1 sural neuralgia. Conclusion: This study found that SDA using fresh-frozen femoral head allograft without an orthobiological agent was cost-effective and may have outcomes comparable to those using autograft or allograft enriched with orthobiological agents. Level of Evidence: Level IV, retrospective case series. © The Author(s) 2013.

84878187473	Effect on Pain Relief and Inflammatory Response Following Addition of Tenoxicam to Intravenous Patient-Controlled Morphine Analgesia: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Study in Patients Undergoing Spine Fusion Surgery	Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that adding tenoxicam (T) to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with morphine (M) would improve postoperative pain relief and wound inflammatory responses compared with M alone after spine surgery. Design: Randomized, prospective, double-blind, controlled study. Subjects: Ninety-four patients eligible for elective spine surgery. Setting: Teaching hospital. Methods: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: the M group (PCA regimen with M), the TM group (PCA regimen with T and M), or the T+TM group (20mg T administered 30 minutes before wound closure in addition to the TM regimen). The primary end point was the numeric rating scale score for pain intensity, and secondary end points pertaining to postoperative pain management included M consumption, PCA demand/delivery, use of rescue analgesics, adverse events, and levels of inflammatory mediators in wound drainages. Results: PCA demand was reduced in both the TM and T+TM groups compared with the M group (both P≤0.001). The incidence of skin itching was significantly reduced in the T+TM group compared with the other groups (both P≤0.05). PGE

84879068031	Effects of cord pretension and stiffness of the Dynesys system spacer on the biomechanics of spinal decompression - A finite element study	Background: The Dynesys system provides stability for destabilized spines while preserving segmental motion. However, clinical studies have demonstrated that the Dynesys system does not prevent adjacent segment disease. Moreover, biomechanical studies have revealed that the stiffness of the Dynesys system is comparable to rigid fixation. Our previous studies showed that adjusting the cord pretension of the Dynesys system alleviates stress on the adjacent level during flexion. We also demonstrated that altering the stiffness of Dynesys system spacers can alleviate stress on the adjacent level during extension of the intact spine. In the present study, we hypothesized that omitting the cord preload and changing the stiffness of the Dynesys system spacers would abate stress shielding on adjacent spinal segments. Methods. Finite element models were developed for - intact spine (INT), facetectomy and laminectomy at L3-4 (DEC), intact spine with Dynesys system (IntDyWL), decompressed spine with Dynesys system (DecDyWL), decompressed spine with Dynesys system without cord preload (DecDyNL), and decompressed spine with Dynesys system assembled using spacers that were 0.8 times the standard diameter without cord pretension (DecDyNL0.8). These models were subjected to hybrid control for flexion, extension, axial rotation; and lateral bending. Results: The greatest decreases in range of motion (ROM) at the L3-4 level occurred for axial rotation and lateral bending in the IntDyWL model and for flexion and extension in the DecDyWL model. The greatest decreases in disc stress occurred for extension and lateral bending in the IntDyWL model and for flexion in the DecDyWL model. The greatest decreases in facet contact force occurred for extension and lateral bending in the DecDyNL model and for axial rotation in the DecDyWL model. The greatest increases in ROMs at L2-3 level occurred for flexion, axial rotation and lateral bending in IntDyWL model and for extension in the DecDyNL model. The greatest increases in disc stress occurred for flexion, axial rotation and lateral bending in the IntDyWL model and for extension in the DecDyNL model. The greatest increases in facet contact force occurred for extension and lateral bending in the DecDyNL model and for axial rotation in the IntDyWL model. Conclusions: The results reveals that removing the Dynesys system cord pretension attenuates the ROMs, disc stress, and facet joint contact forces at adjacent levels during flexion and axial rotation. Removing cord pretension together with softening spacers abates stress shielding for adjacent segment during four different moments, and it provides enough security while not jeopardizes the stability of spine during axial rotation. © 2013 Shih et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84881462712	Polymethylmethacrylate augmentation of cannulated pedicle screws for fixation in osteoporotic spines and comparison of its clinical results and biomechanical characteristics with the needle injection method	Study Design: This is a retrospective study carried out to evaluate the clinical Results of patients with osteoporosis and various spinal diseases treated surgically with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-augmented cannulated pedicle screws, and to compare this method with the needle injection technique in terms of the clinical Results and fixation strength. Objectives: To report a technique using PMMA-augmented cannulated pedicle screws for fixation in osteoporotic spines and to compare its clinical Results and biomechanical characteristics with the needle injection technique. Summary of Background Data: Many studies have shown that PMMA-augmented pedicle screws can significantly increase the stiffness and strength of the screw. Various designs of cannulated screws have been used for cement augmentation in experimental studies; however, clinical reports using these screws in osteoporotic patients are rare. A practical and reliable technique and optimal screw design have not yet been established. Methods: Forty-five patients (23 women, 22 men), mean age of 71.37 years (range, 53-94 y), with osteoporosis and various spinal diseases underwent spinal decompression and instrumentation with PMMA augmentation of cannulated pedicle screws. Preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale scores for pain and the Oswestry disability index questionnaire data were analyzed. Screw migration, which is the distance from the screw tip to the anterior cortex and the upper endplate of the vertebra, was also evaluated immediately after surgery and at the mean follow-up of 15.9 months. These clinical Results were then compared with those reported for the needle injection technique. The pullout strength, insertional, and backout torque of these 2 techniques were compared using osteoporotic synthetic bone (0.12 g/cm). Results: A total of 255 out of 283 cannulated screws were augmented with PMMA. The mean visual analog scale pain score of these patients improved from 9.5 to 3.1 (P<0.01) and the functional Oswestry disability index score improved from 71% to 28.9% (P<0.01). Kyphotic deformity of the compression fracture group (19 patients) was improved from an average of 9.38 to 3.27 degrees after surgery, and to 5.45 degrees at the final follow-up (P<0.01). There was no significant vertical screw migration when the screws' distances were compared just after the operation and at the final follow-up (P>0.01). However, significant horizontal screw migration was found in lesions below the L2 level (P<0.01). There was no major neurovascular injury, except in 1 patient, who had persistent left thigh pain due to cement leakage at the L1 level, and the symptom was controlled with analgesics. The clinical Results of both techniques were satisfactory and there were no significant differences. Although the pullout strength and screw backout torque was significantly higher in the needle injection group (234.1 vs. 187.8 N, 1119.6 vs. 836.7 N mm, respectively), the operation time was shorter and the cement leakage rate was less in the cannulated pedicle screw group than that of the needle injection group (211.4 vs. 296.3 min, 14.05% vs. 26.2%, respectively). Conclusions: The technique of cannulated pedicle screws with PMMA augmentation used in this study can be an option for osteoporotic patients with various spinal diseases who require spinal instrumentation. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84883559720	The clinical significance of rapid prototyping technique in complex spinal deformity surgery-Case sharing and literature review	Treatment of complex severe spinal deformities, such as scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 90°, critical spinal kyphosis, or vertebral and rib deformity with impaired lung capacity, remains a great challenge. Preoperative image studies including plain film radiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging provide only two-dimensional (2D) images and limited information about these severe deformities. In addition, these studies cannot directly offer visual or tactile feedback for surgeons and patients. On the contrary, the rapid prototyping (RP) technique provides surgeons with full-scale, 3D models, which make more accurate and more direct morphometric information of the complex spinal deformity obtainable. In this study, we intend to share our experience with the RP technique in pediatric spine deformity cases and to provide a literature review. In our study, two patients with severe spinal deformity were included. A real-size spinal model was produced for each patient on the basis of contiguous computer tomography with a slice thickness of 1mm. All models were used to plan the resection and to identify the anatomic landmarks during the operation. With the aid of these full-scale spinal models, all surgical procedures were performed exactly according to the preoperative plan. A 16-year-old girl with congenital scoliosis with a Cobb angle greater than 90° received staged surgery, including vertebral column resection, correction, and posteriolateral spinal fusion. The other patient was a 3-year-old boy with 80° of Gibbus spine deformity. By means of an anteriolateral approach after thoracotomy, the paraspinal abscess debridement, vertebral column resection, and vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib application were performed. No postoperative complications such as spinal cord, nerve root, or major vascular injuries were found. The 3D RP models are really helpful in providing direct visual and tactile feedback, improving preoperative planning, identifying the important anatomic landmarks during the surgery, and communicating with patients. If the RP technique can be improved in the future, it is likely to become more acceptable and practical. © 2013.

84886094456	Primary cervical osteomyelitis	Background: Cervical osteomyelitis accounts for only 3-11% of all cases of spinal osteomyelitis, and the diagnosis may be delayed. The characteristics of different pathogens causing cervical osteomyelitis are not fully understood, and there are few established guidelines for treatment. Methods: The cases of six patients who presented with primary cervical osteomyelitis in the orthopedic department between January 2002 and March 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had been treated with anterior decompression, instrumentation, and autograft fusion. Data about preoperative and postoperative symptoms, neurological function, pain, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the results of plain film and magnetic resonance imaging were reviewed. Results: Intraoperative cultures revealed Staphylococcus aureus in three patients. Propionibacterium acnes in two, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one. The mean duration between symptoms and diagnosis was 7.2 weeks (range, 3-12 weeks). Three patients with S. aureus infections had relatively higher preoperative CRP levels (mean, 173mg/L) than did the patients with P. acnes infections or tuberculosis (mean, 5.5mg/L). However, bony destruction was less severe in patients with S. aureus infections than in those patients with P. acnes and tuberculosis. All CRP levels returned to normal in 12 weeks, and all six patients had a final stable cervical alignment and fusion. Ultimately, neurological function and pain score improved in all patients. Conclusion: Cervical osteomyelitis caused by S. aureus has an acute onset, higher CRP level, shorter duration from onset to diagnosis and thus causes less bony destruction. By contrast, cervical osteomyelitis caused by P. acnes and tuberculosis has an indolent course, a low or even normal CRP level, a longer duration from onset to diagnosis, and produces more severe bony destruction. Anterior decompression, instrumentation, and autograft fusion can be successfully used to treat primary cervical osteomyelitis. However, a mesh cage can also be a good alternative to an autograft. © 2013.

84886931910	Osteomyelitis of the femur mimicking bone tumors: A review of 10 cases	Background: The clinical symptoms and radiographic appearance of osteomyelitis can mimic those of bone tumors.Methods: We reviewed 10 patients with osteomyelitis of the femur who were initially diagnosed as having bone tumors and were subsequently transferred to our institution.Results: Nocturnal pain of moderate intensity occurred in seven patients, and all 10 patients had elevated C-reactive protein levels. The radiographic findings included the following: a permeative, moth-eaten osteolytic lesion in six patients, an osteolytic lesion with sclerotic borders in three patients, and cortical destruction with pathological fracture in one patient. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed for eight patients, and only one had a positive penumbra sign. All patients underwent a surgical biopsy to confirm the final diagnosis for histological analysis and cultures. Klebsiella pneumoniae was detected in six patients and Staphylococcus aureus, the most common organism in osteomyelitis, was detected in three. Recurrence of infection occurred in five patients following debridement surgery; of these three had a Klebsiella pneumoniae infection. All patients received antibiotic treatment for an average of 20.4 weeks (range, 4 to 44) and surgical treatment an average of 1.8 times (range, 1 to 4). At the final follow-up, all patients were fully recovered with no signs of infection.Conclusions: When used in combination, clinical examinations, laboratory data, and radiographic findings can reliably distinguishing osteomyelitis from bone tumors. © 2013 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0142027512	One-stage posterior surgery for treatment of advanced spinal tuberculosis	Background. It is not uncommon that some patients in poor general condition and advanced spinal tuberculosis cannot proceed with the staged anterior spinal surgery after posterior instrumentation. We demonstrated a group of patients with advanced spinal tuberculosis that were treated posterior procedure alone. Methods. From January 1993 to January 2001, 12 patients in our hospital in poor general condition and advanced spinal tuberculosis- marked abscess with angular deformity more than 25° and/or spinal canal compromised more than 30%, were treated in our hospital with posterior instrumentation and chemotherapy only. All patients were immobilized postoperatively with orthosis until solid fusion was noted on bony graft. The chemotherapy persisted for at least 12 months in all patients. Results. Spontaneous bony fusion of vertebrae at 1-year follow-up averaged 75%. Solid union on posterior or posterolateral fusion was about 91.7%. Implant loosening and deep wound infection were noted in 2 of the patients respectively. We assessed the functional results with the postoperative activity condition, symptom relief and medication dependence in the 6th month after the spinal surgery. Seven cases of the 12 patients (58.3%) had good to excellent results in this series. Conclusions. The one-stage posterior surgery adjunct with chemotherapy is a considerable and alternative treatment for patients with advanced spinal tuberculosis and in poor general condition.

0142135900	Kyphosis Correction and Height Restoration Effects of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is known for its pain-relieving effect. Our purpose was to evaluate its effect on the kyphosis angle, wedge angle, and height of the fractured vertebral body. METHODS: We reviewed digital radiographs of 73 vertebral bodies in 53 patients before and after vertebroplasty. We measured the spinal kyphosis angle and the wedge angle of the fractured vertebral body. Ratios of the height of the anterior border, center, and posterior borders of the collapsed vertebra to the height at the posterior border of an adjacent normal vertebral body were measured. Gain from vertebroplasty and the restoration percentage (gain divided by loss) were calculated for each parameter. RESULTS: The kyphosis angle, wedge angle, anterior height, center height, and posterior height significantly improved after vertebroplasty. The mean reduction in the kyphosis angle was 4.3°, and the wedge-angle reduction was 7.4°. The mean wedge-angle reduction in fractured vertebral bodies containing gas was 10.2°. Restoration percentages for the kyphosis angle and wedge angle were 19% and 44%, respectively. Gain in the height of the fractured vertebral bodies was 16.7% for the anterior border, 14% for the center, and 7% for the posterior border. Restoration percentages for the height of the vertebral body were 29% for the anterior border and 27% for the center. CONCLUSION: Vertebroplasty increases the height of the fractured vertebra and reduces the wedge and kyphosis angles. These effects are most remarkable in fractured vertebra containing gas.

0242636232	Flexion-distraction injury of the thoracolumbar spine	Flexion-distraction injury of the thoracolumbar spine results from a failure of both the posterior and middle columns under tension, and this injury is uncommon. Progressive kyphotic deformity frequently develops after conservative treatments. We report our 10 years' experience with the surgical treatment of flexion-distraction injuries. From January 1991 to December 2000, 30 flexion-distraction thoracolumbar spinal injuries were treated at our hospital. We included 23 patients in this study, and seven patients were excluded. The mean age of the patients was 37.2 years. Six were female and 17 were male. All patients received open reduction, posterior instrumentation, and posterior fusion at the level of injury. Post-operatively, patients were all placed in total contact orthoses for 3 months. Ambulation was allowed immediately after brace application. The mean follow-up period was 84.7 months follow-up. The final average follow-up kyphotic angulation was 5.4°, which is an average improvement of 9.5°. Post-operative back pain ratings indicated that result of surgery was mostly good, and the neurological evaluation was almost normal after long-term follow-up. A satisfactory reduction and good stabilisation with solid fusion was achieved in all cases, without any significant loss of reduction. Surgical treatment of reduction and stabilisation with posterior instrumentation and fusion is suggested in patients with flexion-distraction injury of the thoracolumbar spine. © 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

0345874590	Comparison of stabilities between obliquely and conventionally inserted Bagby and Kuslich cages as posterior lumbar interbody fusion in a cadaver model	Background. The Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) cage as posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is reported to give satisfactory results in restoring spinal stability. Moreover, correction by obliquely inserting a single BAK cage has the advantages of reducing exposure, precise implantation, and lower cost. However, biomechanical data on this procedure are not abundant. This study was designed to compare the stability imparted by the cages placed using an oblique and posterior approaches and to determine the effects of supplementary posterior instrumentation. Methods. After affixing nine human cadaveric spines (L2-S1) within a testing frame, load testing in several clinically relevant modes was performed sequentially for the intact and the following procedures across the L4-5 segments: posterior destabilization, stabilization using 2 parallel BAK cages (CBAK group) or 1 oblique BAK cage (OBAK group), and additional stabilization with posterior instrumentation. Spatial locations of vertebral bodies were recorded after each loading step using a 3-D motion measurement system. Results. Except the OBAK group that had a lower stability in left axial rotation, there were no significant differences in the stability between both groups in all loading modes for the stabilization using cages alone. Compared with the intact cases, CBAK cages provide significant improvement in the stability in 5 displacement modes and OBAK cage may restore the stabilities of the specimens to the intact state in 5 modes and provide significant improvement in flexion. Addition of supplementary posterior instrumentation significantly reduced the angular displacements in both groups. Conclusions. Both methods of cage insertion have similar stability. Both implantations, alone or with posterior instrumentation, may improve the stability of the spine, although posterior instrumentation may further strengthen the stability. The oblique insertion is more favorable since it requires less exposure, enables precise implantation, and is less expensive.

84890117541	Posterior instrumentation improves the stabilities of Brantigan and Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) methods of posterior lumbar interbody fusion across the L4-L5 segments in a cadaveric model	Background: The Brantigan and Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) cages for posterior lumbar interbody fusion have different geometric characteristics. However, both cage designs have been demonstrated to be helpful in restoring disc space across spinal motion segments in clinical observations. This study was designed to compare the biomechanical performance of these devices at one-motion segments and to determine the effects of posterior instrumentation on their stabilities. Methods: Eight intact fresh human cadaver spines (L2-S1) were affixed within a testing frame for invitro biomechanical testing: four randomly assigned spines for the BAK cage group and four for the Brantigan cage group. For each spine, the three-dimensional load-displacement behavior of each vertebra was quantified using the Selspot II Motion measurement system during the following steps: (1) intact state; (2) destabilization after laminectomy and discectomy across L4-L5; (3) stabilization using a pair of BAK cages or Brantigan cages; and (4) additional stabilization using variable screw plates (VSP) across L4-L5. Results: The Brantigan cage alone did not show satisfactory results in improving the stability of one-motion segment destabilized spines in left and right axial rotation. However, the BAK cages appeared to provide significant stability in extension, flexion, left and right lateral bending, and left axial rotation. After implanting the additional posterior instrumentation, both cages provided similar and significantly improved stabilities. Conclusion: Although the results indicate that the Brantigan cage did not provide satisfactory improvement in the stabilities as the BAK cage in the one-motion segment model, implantation with additional posterior instrumentation may significantly improve the stabilities and reduce the differences between the two cage designs. © 2013 .

84890119501	Accelerated patellofemoral joint erosion: A complication of isolated resurfacing of an arthritic patella with a polyethylene component	Patellofemoral arthrosis is commonly encountered in clinical practice. This morbid condition can critically affect the patient's quality of life. Many treatments have been reported to address this problem, including operative and nonoperative modalities. Patellofemoral arthroplasty had been reported to have an excellent outcome in some reports, although the treatment is still controversial. We report a case of a complication that arose after isolated resurfacing of an arthritic patella with a polyethylene component. Serious femoral cartilage wear with severe synovitis was noted in the early postoperative period. Clinicians are therefore cautioned to avoid isolated patellar resurfacing for treating patellofemoral arthritis. © 2013 .

84892977650	Concomitant tibial shaft and posterior malleolar fractures can be readily diagnosed from plain radiographs: A retrospective study	Background: Concomitant tibial shaft and posterior malleolar fractures (PMFs) are often encountered in clinical settings. Plain films were reviewed for concomitant PMF, and fracture patterns were analyzed by focusing on the integrity of the fibula and the location of the fibular fracture. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who presented with tibial shaft fractures between January 2005 and January 2010 was performed. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years of age and had a tibial diaphyseal fracture. Exclusion criteria were age less than 18 years, previous surgery on the same leg, and pathological fractures. Medical records were reviewed for information on injury mechanisms. Pre- and post-operative radiographs were analyzed for PMFs, tibial fracture pattern, fibular integrity, fibular fracture pattern, treatment type, and time to fracture union. Descriptive statistical tests were used. Results: Among 240 patients, there were 20 cases (15 male and 5 female) of concomitant PMF, all detected in lateral radiograph views. The incidence of PMF was 8.3%. Most patients had a motorcycle injury (n = 15, 75%). Distal tibia spiral fracture was the most common fracture pattern (85%) and there was no proximal tibia fracture (0%). Combined fibular fractures were found in 17 patients (85%). There were nine proximal fibular fractures (45%). Intact fibulas were found in three patients (15%). Only one PMF was treated with screw fixation. All PMFs showed radiographic evidence of healing within 5 months post-operatively. Conclusion: We recommend careful radiographic examination to evaluate PMF, especially in patients with distal tibial spiral fractures combined with proximal fibular fractures or intact fibulas. © 2013.

84896734743	Pulmonary embolism following total knee arthroplasty in Taiwanese patients	Background: Pulmonary embolism is a relatively uncommon, but serious, postoperative complication of hip and knee arthroplasty however, little information is available about the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in Taiwan. Methods: We report here a series of five patients who sustained a symptomatic pulmonary embolism after undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA). These patients were identified during a retrospective study of 1768 patients carried out between January 2007 and January 2010. Results: Five (0.28%) patients who sustained a symptomatic pulmonary embolism after TKA were identified in a series of 1768 patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography angiography findings in four patients and an increased d-dimer level in one patient. All the patients were women, with a mean age of 68.0 years (range 64-76 years). The average body mass index of these patients was 32.6kg/m

84896888841	Cytotoxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 against osteosarcoma through ROS-mediated AKT and cell cycle inhibition	Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a critical cell cycle regulator, has been identified as a potential target in osteosarcoma (OS). 15-deoxy-Δ12, 14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a prostaglandin derivative, has shown its anti-tumor activity by inducing apoptosis through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inactivation of v-akt, a murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog, (AKT) in cancer cells. In the study analyzing its effects on arthritis, 15d-PGJ2 mediated shear-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent regulation of PLK1. In this study, the cytotoxic effect and mechanism underlying 15d-PGJ2 effects against OS were explored using OS cell lines. 15d-PGJ2 induced significant G2/M arrest, and exerted time- and dosedependent cytotoxic effects against all OS cell lines. Western blot analysis showed that both AKT and PKA-PLK1 were down-regulated in OS cell lines after treatment with 15d-PGJ2. In addition, transfection of constitutively active AKT or PLK1 partially rescued cells from 15d-PGJ2-induced apoptosis, suggesting crucial roles for both pathways in the anti-cancer effects of 15d-PGJ2. Moreover, ROS generation was found treatment with 15d-PGJ2, and its cytotoxic effect could be reversed with N-acetyl l-cysteine. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK partially rescued 15d-PGJ2 cytotoxicity. Thus, ROS-mediated JNK activation may contribute to apoptosis through down-regulation of the p-Akt and PKA-PLK1 pathways. 15d-PGJ2 is a potential therapeutic agent for OS, exerting cytotoxicity mediated through both AKT and PKA-PLK1 inhibition, and these results form the basis for further analysis of its role in animal studies and clinical applications.

84899891214	Biomechanical analysis and design of a dynamic spinal fixator using topology optimization: A finite element analysis	Surgeons often use spinal fixators to manage spinal instability. Dynesys (DY) is a type of dynamic fixator that is designed to restore spinal stability and to provide flexibility. The aim of this study was to design a new spinal fixator using topology optimization [the topology design (TD) system]. Here, we constructed finite element (FE) models of degenerative disc disease, DY, and the TD system. A hybrid-controlled analysis was applied to each of the three FE models. The rod structure of the topology optimization was modelled at a 39 % reduced volume compared with the rigid rod. The TD system was similar to the DY system in terms of stiffness. In contrast, the TD system reduced the cranial adjacent disc stress and facet contact force at the adjacent level. The TD system also reduced pedicle screw stresses in flexion, extension, and lateral bending. © 2014 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

84902526705	Optimization of culture conditions for stem cells derived from human anterior cruciate ligament and bone marrow	Tissue engineering with stem cells is a fascinating approach for treating anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. In our previous study, stem cells isolated from the human anterior cruciate ligament were shown to possess extensive proliferation and differentiation capabilities when treated with specific growth factors. However, optimal culture conditions and the usefulness of fetal bovine serum (FBS) as a growth factor in in vitro culture systems are yet to be determined. In this study, we compared the effects of different culture media containing combinations of various concentrations of FBS and the growth factors basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) on the proliferation and differentiation of ligament-derived stem cells (LSCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). We found that α-MEM plus 10% FBS and bFGF was able to maintain both LSCs and BMSCs in a relatively undifferentiated state but with lower major extracellular matrix (ECM) component gene expression and protein production, which is beneficial for stem cell expansion. However, the differentiation and proliferation potentials of LSCs and BMSCs were increased when cultured in MesenPRO, a commercially available stem cell medium containing 2% FBS. MesenPRO in conjunction with TGF-β1 had the greatest ability to induce the differentiation of BMSCs and LSCs to ligament fibroblasts, which was evidenced by the highest ligamentous ECM gene expression and protein production. These results indicate that culture media and growth factors play a very important role in the success of tissue engineering. With α-MEM plus 10% FBS and bFGF, rapid proliferation of stem cells can be achieved. In this study, MesenPRO was able to promote differentiation of both LSCs and BMSCs to ligament fibroblasts. Differentiation was further increased by TGF-β1. With increasing understanding of the effects of different culture media and growth factors, manipulation of stem cells in the desired direction for ligament tissue engineering can be achieved. © 2014 Cognizant Comm.

84905453973	Does the size of the rod affect the surgical results in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? 5.5-mm versus 6.35-mm rod	Background Context Favorable clinical outcomes of surgical treatment with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation (CDI) or instrumentations that follow the principles of CDI, for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) have been reported. However, there are few studies concerning the results with rods of different sizes. Purpose To find out whether the rod size affects the surgical results for AIS. Study design A retrospective cohort study based on the same spinal system with different sizes of rod. Patient sample A consecutive series of 93 patients, who underwent posterior correction with posterior instrumentation and fusion for AIS, were included and retrospectively analyzed. Outcome measures Postoperative radiologic outcomes were evaluated using coronal curves, percentage of curve correction, and coronal global balance. Methods Ninety-three patients treated during the period January 2000 to December 2008 were included in this study; 48 patients were treated with the Cotrel-Dubousset Horizon (CDH) M10 system with a 6.35-mm rod from January 2000 through December 2004, and a CDH M8 was used with a 5.5-mm rod in another 45 patients from January 2005 through December 2008. The Cobb angle, Risser grade, coronal curves, flexibility of curve, percentage of curve correction, coronal global balance, operative time, and estimated blood loss were measured and analyzed. The same parameters were used when the patient was followed at the OPD. All of the patients underwent regular follow-up for at least 2 years. Results No statistical significance was observed in the demographic data, including age, sex, BMI, and Risser grade, between these 2 groups. The overall average percentage of correction was 60.0%±12.7%: 60.7%±12.5% for the CDH M10 group, and 59%±13.1% for the CDH M8 group. At the final follow-up, the overall average loss of correction was 4.8±3.9° for the CDH M10 group, and 4.3±4.0° for the CDH M8 group. The average percentage of correction at the final follow-up was 50.9%±15.1% for the CDH M10 group, and 51.1%±16.1% for the M8 group. No statistical significance could be observed in the radiologic parameters between these 2 groups. Conclusion The radiologic results for the 5.5-mm rod and the 6.35-mm rod were comparable in terms of correction, loss of correction, and coronal global balance. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84905665816	Wake-up test in total hip arthroplasty with high-riding developmental dysplasia	Total hip arthroplasty (THA) for patients with Crowe type IV developmental dysplasia of the hip is technically challenging. This group of patients has a higher incidence of nerve injury during THA. Although neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring has been developed to provide nerve monitoring, it is not always available. The wake-up test has been used for intraoperative spinal cord monitoring during major spinal surgery, but no study has reported the use of the wake-up test for neurologic monitoring during THA in patients with severe developmental dysplasia of the hip. The authors retrospectively reviewed 22 THA procedures in 20 patients with Crowe type IV developmental dysplasia of the hip who underwent the wakeup test during THA. In the current study, 1 patient could not dorsiflex her foot during the wake-up test. Therefore, the authors immediately reduced the length of limb lengthening by 1 cm. Postoperative drop foot and numbness occurred but resolved completely 2 months later. None of the patients who showed no deficits in motion of the feet during the intraoperative wake-up test had signs of postoperative nerve injury. In the current study, there was no false-positive or false-negative finding. The authors concluded that the wake-up test, which is simple, safe, and reliable, is a useful technique and a possible alternative to neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring in checking nerve function during THA in patients with severe developmental dysplasia of the hip.

The aim of this study was to review the clinical outcome and local recurrence rate after surgical excision of nonpalpable intramuscular hemangioma using preoperative ultrasound-guided hookwire localization. Methods: We performed ultrasound-guided hookwire localization before excision surgery for nonpalpable intramuscular hemangioma in 37 cases between January 1997 and 2011. There were 20 females and 17 males, with a mean age of 30.2 years (range, 17-49 years). The mean localization procedure time was 10.6 minutes (range, 3-20 minutes). Results: The average operation time was 48.6 minutes (range, 30-80 minutes). The average length of the excision wound was 5 cm (range, 4-11 cm), and the average hospital stay was 2.5 days (range, 2-4 days). The postoperative therapeutic report confirmed the diagnosis of intramuscular hemangioma. The average tumor size was 2.11 cm and all excision margins were free in all specimens. After the mean follow-up of 92.9 months (range, 14-179 months), one of the 37 patients had local recurrence (recurrence rate 2.7%). Conclusion: The use of ultrasound-guided hookwire localization before excision surgery is safe and effective in treating nonpalpable intramuscular hemangioma and could provide a better cosmetic result and functional recovery. © 2014.

13444272952	Posterior instrumentation reduces differences in spine stability as a result of different cage orientations an in vitro study	Study Design. A multisegmental cadaveric spine model was used to quantify the load-displacement behavior of intact spine specimens, specimens injured and stabilized using Bagby and Kuslich (BAK) cages as lumbar interbody fusion devices with or without posterior instrumentation across two levels. Objectives. To compare the stabilities imparted by the cages placed using an oblique and conventional posterior approaches and to determine the effects of supplementary posterior instrumentation. Summary of Background Data. The BAK cage as posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) has been used to restore disc height, reduce morbidity, provide immediate stability to the patients, and enhance fusion rates. The obliquely inserted BAK cage has the advantages of reducing exposure and precise implantation. The biomechanical efficacy of this procedure is sparse, especially in comparison to the PLIF with and without posterior instrumentation. Methods. Nine fresh human ligamentous spines (L2-S1) were affixed within a testing frame for determining their load-displacement behaviors. Load testing in clinically relevant modes was performed sequentially for the intact and the following procedures across the L4-S1 segment: posterior destabilisation, stabilization using two parallel BAK cages (CBAK group) or one oblique BAK cage (OBAK group), further stabilization with posterior instrumentation, and finally cyclic loading in flexion-extension. Spatial positions of the LEDs attached to vertebral bodies were recorded using a three-dimensional motion measurement system. Results. When used alone to restore stability the orientation of the cage affected the outcome. In flexion OBAK orientation and in extension CBAK orientation provided better stability (decrease in motion with respect to intact case), compared with the other orientation. In lateral bending, CBAK orientation was found to be better than OBAK. In axial mode, CBAK orientation was effective in both directions while OBAK was effective only in right axial rotation. With the supplementary posterior fixation, the differences in stability resulting from the orientations were not noticeable at all, both before and after cyclic tests. Conclusions. Owing to the differences in the surgical approach and the amount of dissection, the stability for the cages when used alone as a function of cage orientation was different. These subtle differences were reduced by the use of posterior fixation device, underscoring the importance of using instrumentation when cages are used as PLIFs. However, the oblique insertion may be more favorable since it requires less exposure, enables precise implantation, and is less expensive, especially when used with supplementary instrumentation.

13744256317	Biomechanical analysis of the disc adjacent to posterolateral fusion with laminectomy in lumbar spine	Objectives: After posterolateral fusion with laminectomy for the degenerative lumbar spine, accelerated degeneration of the disc adjacent to the fusion mass has been clinically observed. Previous studies used a finite element model (FEM) to calculate the stress of the adjacent disc in the fused lumbar spine with spinal fixator and bone graft. However, little emphasis was placed on the simultaneous spinal fusion and decompression procedure. To investigate if the spinal decompression procedure in posterolateral fusion would increase stress significantly, the FEM was employed to estimate the stress concentration of the disc above the fusion mass in posterolateral fusion with laminectomy and hemilaminectomy. Methods: Three FEMs of the lumbar spine were established: intact spine, posterolateral fusion with total laminectomy, and posterolateral fusion with hemilaminectomy (preserved partial lamina, spinous process, and supraspinous and interspinous ligaments). The posterolateral fusion added spinal fixator and bone graft between the transverse process. The L1 vertebral body was subjected to 10-Nm flexion, extension, torsion, and lateral bending. The bottom of the L5 vertebral body was fixed. Results: In flexion, the stress on the adjacent disc in posterolateral fusion with laminectomy and hemilaminectomy respectively increased 90% and 21% over that of the intact spine. In posterolateral fusion with hemilaminectomy, the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments shared some external forces to alleviate the stress concentration of the adjacent disc. However, in extension, torsion, and lateral bending, these two fusion models had almost no change in range of motion and stress of adjacent disc. Conclusion: Posterolateral fusion with hemilaminectomy (preserved partial lamina, spinous process, and supraspinous and interspinous ligaments) was able to alleviate the stress concentration of the disc above the fusion mass in flexion.
