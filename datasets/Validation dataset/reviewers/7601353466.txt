84940312845	Induction of peroxiredoxin 1 by hypoxia regulates heme oxygenase-1 via NF-κB in oral cancer	Overexpression of peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) has been observed in numerous cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The precise molecular mechanism of up-regulation of Prx1 in carcinogenesis, however, is still poorly understood. The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between Prx1 and hypoxia, and potential mechanism(s) of Prx1 in OSCC cell line SCC15 and xenograft model. We treated wild-type and Prx1 knockdown SCC15 cells with transient hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. We detected the condition of hypoxia, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and expression and/or activity of Prx1, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). We found that hypoxia induces ROS accumulation, up-regulates Prx1, increases NF-κB translocation and DNA binding activity, and down-regulates HO-1 in vitro. In Prx1 knockdown cells, the expression level of HO-1 was increased, while NFκB translocation and DNA binding activity were decreased after hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation treatment. Moreover, we mimicked the dynamic oxygenation tumor microenvironment in xenograft model and assessed the above indices in tumors with the maximal diameter of 2 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm or 15 mm, respectively. Our data showed that tumor hypoxic condition and expression of Prx1 are significantly associated with tumor growth. The expression of HO-1 and NF-κB, and NF-κB DNA binding activity were significantly elevated in 15 mm tumors, and the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine was increased in 10 mm and 15 mm tumors, compared to those in size of 2 mm. The results from this study provide experimental evidence that overexpression of Prx1 is associated with hypoxia, and Prx1/NF-κB/HO-1 signaling pathway may be involved in oral carcinogenesis. © 2014 Zhang et al.

21444446018	Biodegradation of DTP and PET fiber by enzymes	Biodegradation of PET is one of the current focus of study in the world, which can solve the environmental polluting problem of a great deal of white garbage induced by the increasing production of PET. Diethylene glycol terephthalate (DTP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fiber were degraded by enzymes in this paper. It was concluded that, the proper condition of biodegradation of DTP with the crude enzymes extracted from activated sludge was 30°C, medium pH. Through the analysis of degradation kinetics, the crude enzymes have stronger capability of degrading DTP than lipase. In addition, the crude enzymes can also degrade PET fiber.

3042660183	A study on the biodegradability of polyethylene terephthalate fiber and diethylene glycol terephthalate	The degradation of diethylene glycol terephthalate (DTP) and polyethylene terephthalate fiber (PET fiber) by microbes and lipase was studied. The HPLC method was used to determine the degradation ratio and degradation rule of DTP. Greater than 90% DTP was degraded by microbes in 24 days and 40% by lipase in 24 h. The degradation of DTP can be described by the first-order reaction model. Although the biodegradation ratio of PET fiber was still weak, we demonstrated with SEM micrographs and HPLC analysis that microbes and lipase could act on the PET fiber and there were some cracks on the surface of the fiber. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33646856395	Influence of ageing on fracture toughness and stress corrosion cracking resistance of B95 forging	The effect of two-stage ageing and regression and reaging heat treatment(RRA) on the fracture toughness and stress corrosion cracking resistance of B95 forging was studied. The fracture toughness, conductivity and strength under nine kinds of two-stage ageing treatment and three kinds of RRA treatment were measured. The results showed that the microstructure and property of the fracture toughness and stress corrosion cracking resistance increased with increase of ageing time and ageing temperature, when the condition of first order ageing treatment was identical. Of all two-step ageing treatment (115°C × 7h+185°C × 13h) was the best ageing one. Although RRA treatment could make B95jre forging the highest strength and stress corrosion cracking resistance, which can reach the level of the treatment (115°C × 7h + 185°C ×13h) after twenty minutes of regression as well, the fracture toughness was lower.

33744961399	Cause of overweight transportation and administration countermeasure	Authors used economic cost and price analysis method to analyze two patterns of the economic profit incentive of overweight transportation: overloading could increase revenue and using lower registered but actually higher load ability vehicle could decrease tax and fee. By evaluating the highway transportation profit maximum condition, authors found that highway transportation operators could not maximize their profit, so they tried to load more goods. Then, authors added the enforcement factor into transportation profit maximum analysis and found that overweight detection probability and punishment degree were two key factors which influenced overweight transportation enforcement effect. On the basis of cause analysis, authors put forward the main idea of overweight transportation administration, such as strengthening economic adjustment, enhancing intensity of weight enforcement and severity of overweight punishment.

33845517461	Measuring weight loss of the wool treated by enzyme with Coomassie Brilliant Blue	This paper studied the feasibility of measuring weight loss of the wool which treated by enzyme with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, analyzed the linearity relationship of the weight loss of the wool fabrics and protein concentration separated out in spent baths. The wool fabrics was treated by three different kinds of enzymes: pawpaw protease, savinase, woolase alone and by three different kinds of pretreatment followed by the same kinds of enzyme or the different kinds of enzymes. The research proved that the linearity relationship was not related to the technics and the stability of the weight loss measured by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This kind of method was not only propitious to the research of the wool shinkproofing treatment using enzyme in the lab, but also made an important role if enzyme used in the practical production.

34548566048	Low temperature dyeing and shrinkage-resistance finishing of wool by composition of salt-ammonia and enzyme treatment	Wool top and knitted fabric were treated with ammonia in the presence of sodium chloride ( salt-ammonia process ). The effectiveness of salt-ammonia process traditionally used as pretreatment for low temperature dyeing has been investigated for conferring shrink-resistance of wool. The pretreatment of salt-ammonia process followed by enzymatic treatment has been proved that contribute to not only the enhancement of dyeing behaviour but also shrinkage-resistance in the present studies. A novel composition of salt-ammonia pretreatment, oxidized and reduced treatment as well as protease modification was recommended to achieve low temperature dyeing and shrinkage-resistance of wool. At the same time, the process conditions were optimized by orthogonal array and assessed by dye uptake rate, weight loss and area shrinkage. Laboratory experiments showed that the knitted fabric treated according to optimized conditions of the combined process, achieved not only improvement of dye abilities but also the strict requirement of machine-washable, representing a possible alternative to chlorination.

77954768456	Study on characteristics of directionally-solidified microstructure for NiAl-Mo eutectic composites	NiAl-Mo eutectic composites with two kinds of composition, 46.59Ni-45.61Al-7.8Mo and 44.86Ni-46.3Al-9.01Mo(at%), were prepared by directional solidification technology. The characteristics of solidification microstructure for the alloys at different withdrawing rates were studied. Results show that the microstructure of 46.59Ni-45.61Al-7.8Mo alloy was hypoeutectic at different withdrawing rates. The primary NiAl phase was dendritic; those initial dendrites disappeared gradually as their preferred growth direction did not coincide with the direction of heat transfer during the vertical directional solidification. With increase of the withdrawing rate, the dendrite arm spacing of NiAl phases was decreased little by little. For the 44.86Ni-46.3Al-9.01Mo alloy, eutectic microstructure of rod-like Mo phases inserted in NiAl matrix was formed at different withdrawing rates. With the increase of the withdrawing rate, both of the average spacing and the average diameter of the Mo phases decreased. When the withdrawing rate exceeded 14 mm/h, the continuous and regularly-ranged rod-like Mo-phase turned to irregular and discontinuous. © 2010, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.

47149096731	Boundaries between subsegments IVa and IVb in the human liver	Until now there has been no definitive anatomical study of the boundary between hepatic subsegments IVa and IVb. In this study, we used a multicolor segmental corrosion cast technique and a multicolor segmental technique on plastinated slices, in combination with helical CT three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction on 15 donated fresh isolated human liver specimens. The corrosion cast technique was carried out on eight of these specimens, and the remaining seven livers were used to make horizontal plastinated slices. Examination of these specimens and observation of 20 additional liver corrosion cast specimens showed that all boundaries between hepatic segments were complex, undulating scissures rather than simple, flat planes. We also found that there was an obvious boundary between subsegments IVa and IVb, such that subsegment IVa laid posterosuperior to subsegment IVb. A tributary of a hepatic vein passed through the boundary between subsegments IVa and IVb, and could serve as an anatomical landmark of this boundary. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The results show that, when the helix cycle is fixed, for the same flow rate, the pressure drop of the shell side of helical baffled heat exchanger decreases with the increase of helix angle, and is far lower than that of segmental baffle heat exchanger; as the shell diameter decreases, the pressure drop increase markedly. For the same Re number, the shell side heat transfer coefficients for helical baffled heat exchanger are lower than those for segmental baffle heat exchanger, and reach the maximum when the helix angle is 40 degrees. At the same flow rate, the helical baffle shell-tube heat exchanger has a higher heat transfer coefficient than that of segmental baffled heat exchanger for both per unit pressure drop and per unit pump power.

69949092815	3D numerical simulation on shell-and-tube heat exchangers with middle-overlapped helical baffles and continuous baffles - Part II: Simulation results of periodic model and comparison between continuous and noncontinuous helical baffles	In this paper, based on the simplified periodic model the performance predictions for heat exchanger with middle-overlapped helical baffles are carried out by 3D simulation for three different helix angles (30°, 40° and 50°), and the commercial codes of GAMBIT 2.3 and FLEUNT 6.3 are adopted in the simulation. It is found that the model average heat transfer coefficient per unit pressure drop of the 40° angle case is the largest, which is in qualitative agreement with the existing literature. The predicted average intersection angle of this case is the smallest, being consistent with the field synergy principle. The performance of periodic model with continuous helical baffle is also compared with that of the noncontinuous middle-overlapped helical baffles. It is found that the heat transfer coefficient per unit pressure drop of the noncontinuous middle-overlapped helical baffles is appreciably larger than that of the continuous helical baffle, indicating that the heat exchanger with noncontinuous middle-overlapped helical baffles has its advantage over the one with continuous helical baffle. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

77953297553	A combination method for preparing casting and transparent liver specimen	With the development of hepatic surgery and radiology, a more accurate understanding of intrahepatic vessels and hepatic segments is necessary. Previously, research in these fields was primarily by means of dissecting livers, preparing corrosion cast specimens, reconstructing three-dimensional MSCT images of intrahepatic vessels, and so on. The aim of this study was to search for a new specimen preparing method, which could demonstrate intrahepatic vessels and the relationships between internal vessels and external structures of liver simultaneously. Rabbit livers were prepared with three different techniques in this study: (a) corrosion-cast technique; (b) transparency technique; and (c) combination technique of cast and transparency. The results showed that the combination of casting and transparent liver specimens in group C could demonstrate both the intrahepatic vessels and the external structures clearly. The relationships between the internal vessels and external structures could also be observed clearly. In conclusion, the combination method for preparing casting and transparent liver specimen created a new approach for the research of intrahepatic vessels, especially for applied basic research of hepatic segments. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Ultraviolet spectrophotometer and HPLC was used to monitor the degradation process and reasonable degradation pathway and the species of enzymes comamonas testosteroni excreted during degradation could be presumed. The degradation pathway might include the breaking of ester bond, the oxidation of hydroxyl, the decarboxylation, the breaking of benzyl and so on revealing that the enzymes might include hydrolase, oxidase, decarboxylase and so on. Benzyl containing chemicals were usually poisonous, so the various degradation capability of comamonas testosteroni ensure it a kind of suitable bacillus to clean the environment. © 2011 IEEE.

Terahertz sensing technology provides a new way for detecting the materials. THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a novel spectroscopic technique which measures the electric field of the radiation through a sample and provides the phase and amplitude changes of the radiation, which can provide information unavailable through conventional methods such as microwave and X-ray techniques. In this investigation, THz-TDS technology was introduced into the textile differentiation. Three kinds of cellulose textile fibers, cotton fiber, bamboo fiber and viscose fiber, were prepared as the sample and detected by THz-TDS at room temperature in the absence of vapor. The temporal and frequency signals of the fibers were obtained. In the THz absorption spectrum, the characteristic absorption peaks of textile fibers in THz wave band were found, which can be used to recognize the fibers. This approach provides a novel non-contact examine method for fiber identification in complicated textiles.3. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The location and the causes of the 12 cases with mechanical obstruction were all clear diagnosed, and the vessels and the involved intestinal tube of 4 cases with vascular intestinal obstruction were also determined. Nine cases of the 16 patients were complete obstruction, and other 7 cases were partial obstruction. [Conclusion] The different angle MPR of MSCT is added to transaxial images which could help to definite the cause, location, characteristics of bowel obstruction. The MSCT is a preferred investigative method to definitely diagnose the bowel obstruction in clinic.

80053202846	Evolutionary engineering of bacillus for terephthalic acid degradation	Evolutionary engineering is a novel whole-genome wide engineering strategy inspired by natural evolution for strain improvement. Terephthalic acid (TA) is the most important starting material for making synthetic products, especially polyester fiber and plastics. Both TA and its manufacturing wastewater show acute, chronic and molecular toxicity to organisms. In textiles manufacturing, alkali de-weighting finishing of polyester fabrics was a main resource for producing waster water containing TA. Microorganisms can hardly adapt to the high pH caused by the alkali in wastewater of alkali de-weighting process. Although the strain for TA biodegradation already have been isolated, it is necessary to develop new innovative methods of treating TA in alkali de-weighting wastewater effectively. In this investigation, evolutionary engineering was applied to improve the characterization of Bacillus strain and the high pH resistance phenotypes were obtained. The approach of selection procedure presented in this investigation may provide an attractive promising alternative for improvement of pH resistance strain. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

80155143711	Microstructure and room temperature fracture toughness of directionally solidified NiAl-Mo eutectic in situ composites	The microstructure and room temperature fracture toughness of pseudo-binary NiAl-Mo (x= 7.8, 9, 13 and 16 at. %) in situ composites were investigated. For all four alloys examined, uniform and well-aligned Mo fibrous structures were directionally solidified by the liquid metal cooling process at the growth rate of V = 6 μm/s, respectively. With the increase of the Mo content, the spacing of the Mo fibers decreased and the volume fraction of Mo fibers increased. Significant influence of Mo addition on the toughness was observed for the directional solidification alloys, and the fracture toughness was found to increase with volume fraction of Mo rods. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the fracture behavior. Based on the results of theoretical analysis, the composite structures of these alloys provided improvement in fracture toughness over binary NiAl primarily by crack trapping and crack bridging. Interface debonding, crack deflection and microcrack linkage provided further resistance to crack growth. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84859606420	Reconfirmation of the right medial division of the portal venous system of liver	With the development of hepatic surgery and radiology, an increasing amount of researchers have reported discrepancies between the real distribution of the hepatic portal vein branches and Couinaud's segmentation, especially for further division of the right medial division. The present study investigated 25 cadaveric liver dissections and 30 three-dimensional reconstruction images of intrahepatic vessels. The ramifications, course, distribution and quantity of the portal branches were analyzed. An oblique fissure that had few vessels was found among third-order branches of the hepatic portal vein of the right medial division. The right medial division could be redivided into the ventral subsegment and dorsal subsegment by this oblique fissure. A hepatic vein coursed in the oblique fissure between the ventral subsegment and dorsal subsegment. The hepatic vein could serve as an anatomical landmark of the inter-subsegmental plane. This new method of identifying further division of the right medial division is a novel concept providing further information on conventional segmental anatomy. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84863041806	Numerical analysis of two-dimensional fluid/thermal structure loosely-coupled simulation	In this article, the loosely-coupled method is applied to simulate a two dimensional hypersonic fluid-solid thermally-coupled flow around the leading edge of an axisymmetric flying vehicle. The outer flow field governed by the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations and the inner temperature field governed controlled by unsteady heat-conduction equation are both solved by the commercial code FLUENT. From the differences of results of heat transfer rate, surface temperature, and heat transfer coefficient which were obtained by the loosely-coupled simulation at the same instant but with different forward time steps for outer and inner computations the influence of forward time steps are revealed. Such results have a positive significance for the research of the hypersonic vehicle flying simulation by the loosely-coupled method.

84862973477	Surface modification of polyester film by comamonas testosteroni	Polyester film has been widely applied in engineering plastics field, but the high hydrophobicity and low surface free energy limits its usage and desires its surface modification. Biomodification of materials is a developing field which can improve the surface property of materials whithout environmental pollution and high energy consumption. Comamonas testosteroni which could biodegrade the monomer of polyester film diethyl terephthalate was used to biomodify polyester film. The modification reaction was carried out in constant temperature oscillator for 15 days. Diethyl terephthalate was added into the modification medium termly as inducing substrate to induce the microbe secrete more enzymes to catalyse the modification of polyester film. The surface property of the original and modified polyester film were tested through contact angle examination, XPS analysis and FTIR. The results showed that hydrophilicity and surface free energy of the film was increased; the content of oxygen element in the molecules increased; a small quantity of phenolic hydroxyl group appeared on the surface of the film; lipase catalysed hydrolysis reactions and oxygenase catalysed oxidation reactions might occur at the surface of the film according to the degradation pathway of the simulacrum diethyl terephthalate.

84862978429	Perfect cellular eutectic growth in directionally solidified NiAl-Cr(Mo) hypereutectic alloy	Cellular eutectic microstructures with fully lamellar morphology were observed in the directionally solidified Ni-31Al-32Cr-6Mo (at%) hypereutectic alloy at withdrawal rates of 15, 25 and 50 μm/s, but the morphologies of cellular microstructures did not change consecutively with increasing withdrawal rate. The growth interfaces were deep cellular at withdrawal rates of 15 and 50 μm/s, but it changed to be shallow cellular at rate of 25 μm/s. The reason is that the interface undercooling comes to minimum at the middle rate of 25 μm/s. If the interface undercooling decreases, the tendency of constitutional undercooling will be weaken. The small constitutional undercooling will increase the interface stability, so that the interface morphology changes from deep cellular to shallow cellular. The shallow cellular growth interface led to a perfect cellular eutectic microstructure, which was analogous to the planar eutectic microstructure. In this case, the widths of the intercellular regions were narrowest, no coarse or irregular plates existed at the cell boundaries, and the thicknesses of the lamellae were almost uniform. The properties of the alloy may be markedly improved. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863359262	Preparation and properties of pullulan composite films	In the paper, preparation and properties of pullulan composite films were studied. Several kinds of materials (glass, iron, steel, propene polymer and polyvinyl chloride plates) were chosen for preparing films. The results showed that the steel plate was the most suitable material for preparing film. The tensile strength of pullulan film was significantly reduced when the drying temperature was higher than 50°C. The time of dissolution observably decreased, whereas water vapor permeability increased with increasing drying temperature. Pullulan film has higher tensile strength, better water barrier properties, shorter solubilization time and lower elongation at break than those of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose film, respectively. The composite film (Pullulan and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) with weight ratio (1/2) has higher tensile strength, better water barrier properties, longer solubilization time than those of other ratios. Difference properties of films could be obtained in different weight ratio (Pullulan and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

Regenerated cellulose beads were modified with silane, and characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Papain was immobilized on the beads used two different methods including glutaraldehyde and covalent cross-linking method. The immobilized enzyme activity of bead was determinated by BAEE (N-benzoyl- DL-arginine ethyl ester hydrochloride) determination. According to the enzyme activity and immobilization rate compared with covalent cross-linking method, glutaraldehyde cross-linking method is more suitable for amino-modified. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84876293171	A comparison of hepatic segmental anatomy as revealed by cross-sections and MPR CT imaging	To compare the areas of human liver horizontal sections with computed tomography (CT) images and to evaluate whether the subsegments determined by CT are consistent with the actual anatomy. Six human cadaver livers were made into horizontal slices with multislice spiral CT three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction was used during infusion process. Each liver segment was displayed using different color, and 3D images of the portal and hepatic vein were reconstructed. Each segmental area was measured on CT-reconstructed images, which were compared with the actual area on the sections of the same liver. The measurements were performed at four key levels namely: (1) the three hepatic veins, (2) the left, and (3) the right branch of portal vein (PV), and (4) caudal to the bifurcation of the PV. By dividing the sum of these areas by the total area of the liver, the authors got the percentage of the incorrectly determined subsegmental areas. In addition to these percentage values, the maximum distances of the radiologically determined intersegmental boundaries from the true anatomic boundaries were measured. On the four key levels, an average of 28.64 ± 10.26% of the hepatic area of CT images was attributed to an incorrect segment. The mean-maximum error between artificial segments on images and actual anatomical segments was 3.81 ± 1.37 cm. The correlation between radiological segmenting method and actual anatomy was poor. The hepatic segments being divided strictly according to the branching point of the PV could be more informative during liver segmental resection. Clin. Anat. 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84878158944	Experimental performance comparison of shell-and-tube oil coolers with overlapped helical baffles and segmental baffles	Many research studies have been conducted on the performance of shell and tube heat exchanger with helical baffles because of its lower shell-side pressure drop, lower fouling resistance and lower operation and maintenance cost. But the extension of those studies into practical application is limited because of the additional effects caused by the small-size model. In this paper, the performance of shell-and-tube oil coolers with overlapped helical baffles and segmental baffles is compared experimentally, and both of the oil coolers are practical products. The results show that the OCHB (Oil Cooler with Helical Baffles) gets lower shell side pressure drop and higher heat transfer coefficient per unit pressure drop at fixed volume flow rate than the OCSB (Oil Cooler with Segmental Baffles). Based on the experimental data, it can be predicted that with proper design the OCHB can get better heat transfer performance than OCSB. The present studies are beneficial for the design and practical operation of OCSB and OCHB. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84882801333	Field synergy angle distribution and local heat transfer characteristic in shell and tube heat exchanger with helical baffles	Three dimensional numerical simulation and field synergy principle analysis were conducted with simplified periodic models for shell and tube heat exchangers with helical baffles at three helix angles(30°, 40°and 50°), and commercial codes of GAMBIT 2.3 and FLUENT 6.3 were adopted in the simulation. It is found that Nusselt number from the model with 40° angle is the largest and the predicted average field synergy intersection angle is the smallest, which is consistent with the field synergy principle. The distribution characteristics of field synergy angles reveal that the distribution is quite uniform through whole shell side of the exchangers. The investigation on local heat transfer characteristics in different regions on the shell side shows that the heat transfer rate in the central region of the heat exchanger increases with the increase of Reynolds number. © All Rights Reserved.

A series of correction factors were applied to flow and heat transfer correlation equations of ideal tube bank to obtain the shell-side pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient of specific helical baffled heat exchangers. Based on the correlations and Bell-Delaware method, a calculation method for shell-side flow and heat transfer performance was proposed, which can be used for the design and check of helical baffled heat exchangers. Meanwhile, the shell-side pressure drop and overall heat transfer coefficient of an actual oil cooler with helical baffles were tested and applied to the verification of the calculation method. Results show that the proposed design method can basically meet the requirements for engineering application. © 2013 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84887225343	Microstructure investigation of directionally solidified NiAl-Cr(Mo)-xDy (x = 0, 0.1 wt.%) hypereutectic alloys at different withdrawal rates	The microstructures of directionally solidified Ni-31Al-32Cr-6Mo (at.%)-xDy (x = 0, 0.1 wt.%) hypereutectic alloys were studied at different withdrawal rates. The results show that the microstructure changes from the planar eutectic to the cellular eutectic and the volume fraction of the primary Cr(Mo) dendrites decreases for the Dy-free alloy with the withdrawal rate varying from 6 μm/s to 30 μm/s. The addition of 0.1 wt.% Dy promotes the planar-to-cellular transition. Moreover, the white Dy-containing phase does not form in the alloy for the planar interface growth (6 μm/s), but it can occur in the boundary of eutectic cells for the cellular interface growth (30 μm/s). A sketchy model of the planar and cellular growth is supposed to interpret it. © 2013 TMS.

84898678550	Microstructure and mechanical property of directionally solidified NiAl-Cr(Mo)-(Hf, Dy) alloy at different withdrawal rates	The microstructure and mechanical property of directionally solidified Ni-30.95Al-32Cr-6Mo-0.05Hf (at%)-0.1Dy (wt%) alloy were investigated by means of OM, SEM, TEM, EPMA, three-point bending tests and high-temperature tensile tests. With the withdrawal rate increasing from 6 to 120. μm/s, the microstructure changes from planar eutectic to cellular or dendritic eutectic, and both the interlamellar spacing and eutectic cell size decrease gradually. The relation between interlamellar spacing and withdrawal rate can be obtained as λ-=4.55V-0.40. The corresponding room temperature fracture toughness first increases and then decreases, which should be attributed to the microstructural evolution at different withdrawal rates. Moreover, some toughness mechanisms are responsible for the improvement of fracture toughness, such as crack bridging, interface debonding and microcrack linkage. The high-temperature tensile strength is low at the planar growth rate (10. μm/s), and it increases gradually with the increase of withdrawal rate. The strengthening mechanism is also discussed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is observed from experimental results that cross-linking agent, curing temperature and curing time all have significant effects on the wrinkle recovery angle and the mechanical property of fabrics. In addition, foam ratio plays an important role in the process of one-side finished fabric.

84903214246	Evolutionary engineering of bacillus strain for biofunctionalization of PET fabrics	Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) shows excellent properties for textile applications. However, textiles made of PET are uncomfortable to wear for its poor water absorption and adsorption due to the hydrophobic surface. Bioprocess methods are potential tools for fabric modification. However, high crystallinity negatively affects the ability of the enzymes to hydrolyse PET. Although several kinds of hydrolyzing enzymes, such as cutinases, lipase and esterases, have been reported to applied in modification of PET fabric, new microorganism strains remain need to be developed for obtaining more powerful biocatalyst in the modification of PET fabric. Evolutionary engineering is a novel whole-genome wide engineering strategy inspired by natural evolution for strain improvement. This method exploits natural design principles and can be vary effective in phenotype improvement. There have been many recent examples in which satisfactory performance of rationally designed strains was achieved only through evolutionary engineering. In our previous study, a kind of bacilli strain was isolated from the waste water of PET processing factory and has been employed to treat the PET fabrics for improving the comfortable property. In this investigation, the strategy of evolutionary engineering was applied to improve the utilization of PET polymer as carbon source for bacilli strain in the processing of surface biofunctionalization of PET materials. A selection procedure was developed for adaptive evolution of bacilli strain to improve the ability of conversion of PET to small molecular substance in a bacillus strain metabolizes pathways. To increase genetic variability, the initial strain was mutagenesised with ultraviolet radiation to acquire the initial strain population. Evolution of bacilli strain capable of growth on PET as the sole carbon source was started with the initial strain population. The nano- particle of PET was prepared as substrate. In the process of adaptive evolution, the concentration of PET nano- particle was increased slowly until it became the sole carbon source. After a total of 200 generations of selective cultivation, the populations can growth stably on PET nano- particle. The evolved strain was selected and isolated from the populations. The result shows that the evolved strain have the improved capability in surface modification of PET fabrics. The approach of strain improvement presented in this investigation may provide an attractive promising alternative for the application of biotechnology in textile engineering.

84911871954	3D numerical simulation of heat transfer of a heated plate under the electric field generated by a needle electrode	A three-dimensional numerical model that couples the electric field, velocity field, and temperature field is developed based on the commercial code COMSOL Multiphysics. The influences of several factors on convective heat transfer on a heated plate in the electric field generated by a needle electrode are observed. The factors are the applied voltage, the distance between the two electrodes, and the size of the ground plate. The results show that applied voltage is one of the most important factors for the convection heat transfer. The convection heat transfer efficiency significantly increases with the improvement of the applied voltage. From the perspective of the model size, the decrease of the distance between two electrodes and the size of the plate could improve the average convection heat transfer coefficient. Smaller ionic wind device needs lower applied voltage and less electric energy to obtain the same average convection heat transfer coefficient as the bigger one, which provides the theoretical basis for the potential of miniaturizing the ionic wind cooling device.

In the paper the pressure-based CLEAR algorithm is adopted to compute the compressible flows. Meanwhile the performance of different schemes for density and convection terms in compressible flows is investigated. OFCUI, ADBQUICKEST and HLPA schemes are used to discretize the convection term. FUD scheme, the second-order center difference scheme blended first upwind scheme and SMART scheme are used to calculate the density. Flow in a converging-diverging nozzle and flow over a bump are taken as the test cases. Results show that CLEAR algorithm is reliable to compute the compressible flows. The convergence rate accelerates by using SMART scheme to interpolate the density. ADBQUICKEST convection scheme shows the superiority on stability compared with the other two convection schemes.
