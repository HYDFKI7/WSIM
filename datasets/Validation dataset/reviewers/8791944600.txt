84927801918	Search for heavy long-lived charged particles in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV	The result of a search for heavy long-lived charged particles produced in pp collisions at √s=7 TeV at the LHC is described. The data sample has been collected using the CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb<sup>-1</sup>. The inner tracking detectors are used to define a sample of events containing tracks with high momentum and high ionization energy loss. A second sample of events, which have high-momentum tracks satisfying muon identification requirements in addition to meeting high-ionization and long time-of-flight requirements, is analyzed independently. In both cases, the results are consistent with the expected background estimated from data. The results are used to establish cross section limits as a function of mass within the context of models with long-lived gluinos, scalar top quarks and scalar taus. Cross section limits on hyper-meson particles, containing new elementary long-lived hyper-quarks predicted by a vector-like confinement model, are also presented. Lower limits at 95% confidence level on the mass of gluinos (scalar top quarks) are found to be 1098 (737) GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. A limit of 928 (626) GeV/c<sup>2</sup> is set for a gluino (scalar top quark) that hadronizes into a neutral bound state before reaching the muon detectors. The lower mass limit for a pair produced scalar tau is found to be 223 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. Mass limits for a hyper-kaon are placed at 484, 602, and 747 GeV/c<sup>2</sup> for hyper-ρ masses of 800, 1200, and 1600 GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, respectively. © 2012 CERN.

84939493306	Measurement of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at √s = 7 TeV	A measurement is presented of the inelastic proton-proton cross section at a centre-of-mass energy of √s=7 TeV. Using the CMS detector at the LHC, the inelastic cross section is measured through two independent methods based on information from (i) forward calorimetry (for pseudorapidity 3<|η|<5), in collisions where at least one proton loses more than 5×10<sup>-6</sup> of its longitudinal momentum, and (ii) the central tracker (|η|<2.4), in collisions containing an interaction vertex with more than one, two, or three tracks with transverse momenta pT >200 MeV/c. The measurements cover a large fraction of the inelastic cross section for particle production over about nine units of pseudorapidity and down to small transverse momenta. The results are compared with those of other experiments, and with models used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions. © 2013 CERN.

34247648309	CMS physics technical design report, volume II: Physics performance	CMS is a general purpose experiment, designed to study the physics of pp collisions at 14 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It currently involves more than 2000 physicists from more than 150 institutes and 37 countries. The LHC will provide extraordinary opportunities for particle physics based on its unprecedented collision energy and luminosity when it begins operation in 2007. The principal aim of this report is to present the strategy of CMS to explore the rich physics programme offered by the LHC. This volume demonstrates the physics capability of the CMS experiment. The prime goals of CMS are to explore physics at the TeV scale and to study the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking - through the discovery of the Higgs particle or otherwise. To carry out this task, CMS must be prepared to search for new particles, such as the Higgs boson or supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model particles, from the start-up of the LHC since new physics at the TeV scale may manifest itself with modest data samples of the order of a few fb

77954594464	Transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of charged hadrons in pp collisions at √s=7TeV	Charged-hadron transverse-momentum and pseudorapidity distributions in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV are measured with the inner tracking system of the CMS detector at the LHC. The charged-hadron yield is obtained by counting the number of reconstructed hits, hit pairs, and fully reconstructed charged-particle tracks. The combination of the three methods gives a charged-particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity dNch/ dη|η|<0.5 = 5.78 ± 0.01(stat)±0.23(syst) for non-single-diffractive events, higher than predicted by commonly used models. The relative increase in charged-particle multiplicity from √s=0.9 to 7 TeV is [66.1±1.0(stat)±4.2(syst)]%. The mean transverse momentum is measured to be 0.545±0.005(stat)±0.015(syst)GeV/c.

They are based on data from LHC proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0fb-1 collected with the CMS detector in 2011. The ratio of these two measurements is obtained as a function of the rapidity and transverse momentum of the jets. Significant discrepancies are found comparing the data to leading-order simulations and to fixed-order calculations at next-to-leading order, corrected for nonperturbative effects, whereas simulations with next-to-leading-order matrix elements matched to parton showers describe the data best.

The normalised differential top quark-antiquark production cross section is measured as a function of the jet multiplicity in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7(Formula presented.) at the LHC with the CMS detector. The measurement is performed in both the dilepton and lepton+jets decay channels using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0(Formula presented.). Using a procedure to associate jets to decay products of the top quarks, the differential cross section of the (Formula presented.) production is determined as a function of the additional jet multiplicity in the lepton+jets channel. Furthermore, the fraction of events with no additional jets is measured in the dilepton channel, as a function of the threshold on the jet transverse momentum. The measurements are compared with predictions from perturbative quantum chromodynamics and no significant deviations are observed.

84925794665	Study of the underlying event at forward rapidity in pp collisions at √s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV	The underlying event activity in proton-proton collisions at forward pseudo-rapidity (—6.6 < η < —5.2) is studied with the CMS detector at the LHC, using a novel observable: the ratio of the forward energy density, dE/dη, for events with a charged-particle jet produced at central pseudorapidity (|η<sup>jet</sup>| < 2) to the forward energy density for inclusive events. This forward energy density ratio is measured as a function of the central jet transverse momentum, pT, at three different pp centre-of-mass energies (√s = 0.9, 2.76, and 7TeV). In addition, the √s evolution of the forward energy density is studied in inclusive events and in events with a central jet. The results are compared to those of Monte Carlo event generators for pp collisions and are discussed in terms of the underlying event. Whereas the dependence of the forward energy density ratio on jet pT at each ^fs separately can be well reproduced by some models, all models fail to simultaneously describe the increase of the forward energy density with √s in both inclusive events and in events with a central jet.

A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 nb<sup>−1</sup> was collected using the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet transverse momentum balance, azimuthal angle correlations, and pseudorapidity distributions are studied as a function of the transverse energy in the forward calorimeters (E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>). For pPb collisions, the dijet transverse momentum ratio and the width of the distribution of dijet azimuthal angle difference are comparable to the same quantities obtained from a simulated pp reference and insensitive to E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>. In contrast, the mean value of the dijet pseudorapidity is found to change monotonically with increasing E<sup>4<|η|<5.2</sup> <inf>T</inf>, indicating a correlation between the energy emitted at large pseudorapidity and the longitudinal motion of the dijet frame. The pseudorapidity distribution of the dijet system in minimum bias pPb collisions is compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions, and the data more closely match the latter.

71049130701	Performance studies of the CMS Strip Tracker before installation	In March 2007 the assembly of the Silicon Strip Tracker was completed at the Tracker Integration Facility at CERN. Nearly 15% of the detector was instrumented using cables, fiber optics, power supplies, and electronics intended for the operation at the LHC. A local chiller was used to circulate the coolant for low temperature operation. In order to understand the efficiency and alignment of the strip tracker modules, a cosmic ray trigger was implemented. From March through July 4.5 million triggers were recorded. This period, referred to as the Sector Test, provided practical experience with the operation of the Tracker, especially safety, data acquisition, power, and cooling systems.

This allowed us to perform first alignment of the active silicon modules with the cosmic tracks using three different statistical approaches; validate the survey and laser alignment system performance; and test the stability of Tracker structures under various stresses and temperatures ranging from +15 °C to -15 °C. Comparison with simulation shows that the achieved alignment precision in the barrel part of the tracker leads to residual distributions similar to those obtained with a random misalignment of 50 (80) μm RMS in the outer (inner) part of the barrel. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

78650553319	Search for quark compositeness with the dijet centrality ratio in pp collisions at √s=7TeV	A search for quark compositeness in the form of quark contact interactions, based on hadronic jet pairs (dijets) produced in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV, is described. The data sample of the study corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.9pb⊃-1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The dijet centrality ratio, which quantifies the angular distribution of the dijets, is measured as a function of the invariant mass of the dijet system and is found to agree with the predictions of the standard model. A statistical analysis of the data provides a lower limit on the energy scale of quark contact interactions. The sensitivity of the analysis is such that the expected limit is 2.9 TeV; because the observed value of the centrality ratio at high invariant mass is below the expectation, the observed limit is 4.0 TeV at the 95% confidence level. © 2010 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

79960179054	Measurement of Wγ and Zγ production in pp collisions at s=7 TeV	A measurement of W γ and Z γ production in proton-proton collisions at s=7 TeV is presented. Results are based on a data sample recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb-1. The electron and muon decay channels of the W and Z are used. The total cross sections are measured for photon transverse energy ETγ>10 GeV and spatial separation from charged leptons in the plane of pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle ΔR(ℓ,γ)>0.7, and with an additional dilepton invariant mass requirement of Mℓℓ>50 GeV for the Z γ process. The following cross section times branching fraction values are found: σ(pp→Wγ+X)×B(W→ℓν)=56.3±5.0(stat.)±5.0(syst.)±2.3(lumi.) pb and σ(pp→Zγ+X)×B(Z→ℓℓ)=9.4±1.0(stat.)±0.6(syst.)±0.4(lumi.) pb. These measurements are in agreement with standard model predictions. The first limits on anomalous WW γ, ZZ γ, and Z γγ trilinear gauge couplings at s=7 TeV are set. © 2011 CERN.

80053362057	Long-range and short-range dihadron angular correlations in central PbPb collisions at psNN = 2:76 TeV	First measurements of dihadron correlations for charged particles are presented for central PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 2.76TeV over a broad range in relative pseudorapidity (Δν) and the full range of relative azimuthal angle (Δø). The data were collected with the CMS detector, at the LHC. A broadening of the away-side (Δø y≈ π) azimuthal correlation is observed at all Δν, as compared to the measurements in pp collisions. Furthermore, long-range dihadron correlations in Δν are observed for particles with similar ø values. This phenomenon, also known as the \ridge", persists up to at least jΔνj = 4. For particles with transverse momenta (pT) of 2-4 GeV/c, the ridge is found to be most prominent when these particles are correlated with particles of pT = 2-6 GeV/c, and to be much reduced when paired with particles of pT = 10-12 GeV/c.

80053395960	Charged particle multiplicities in pp interactions at √s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7TeV	Measurements of primary charged hadron multiplicity distributions are presented for non-single-diffractive events in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of √s = 0.9, 2.36, and 7TeV, in five pseudorapidity ranges from |η| < 0.5 to |η| < 2.4. The data were collected with the minimum-bias trigger of the CMS experiment during the LHC commissioning runs in 2009 and the 7TeV run in 2010. The multiplicity distribution at √s = 0.9 TeV is in agreement with previous measurements. At higher energies the increase of the mean multiplicity with √s is underestimated by most event generators. The average transverse momentum as a function of the multiplicity is also presented. The measurement of higher-order moments of the multiplicity distribution confirms the violation of Koba-Nielsen-Olesen scaling that has been observed at lower energies.

80053654786	Missing transverse energy performance of the CMS detector	During 2010 the LHC delivered pp collisions with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In this paper, the results of comprehensive studies of missing transverse energy as measured by the CMS detector are presented. The results cover the measurements of the scale and resolution for missing transverse energy, and the effects of multiple pp interactions within the same bunch crossings on the scale and resolution. Anomalous measurements of missing transverse energy are studied, and algorithms for their identification are described. The performance of several reconstruction algorithms for calculating missing transverse energy are compared. An algorithm, called missing-transverse-energy significance, which estimates the compatibility of the reconstructed missing transverse energy with zero, is described, and its performance is demonstrated. © 2011 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration, published under license by IOP Publishing Ltd.

For most of these data, the solenoidal magnet was operated with a central field of 3.8 T. The analysis of data from 246 out of a total of 250 chambers indicates a very good muon reconstruction capability, with a coordinate resolution for a single hit of about 260 μm, and a nearly 100% efficiency for the drift tube cells. The resolution of the track direction measured in the bending plane is about 1.8 mrad, and the efficiency to reconstruct a segment in a single chamber is higher than 99%.

The measurement is based on a dimuon sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 314 nb<sup>-1</sup>. The J/ψ differential cross section is determined, as a function of the J/ψ transverse momentum, in three rapidity ranges. A fit to the decay length distribution is used to separate the prompt from the non-prompt (b hadron to J/ψ) component. Integrated over J/ψ transverse momentum from 6.5 to 30 GeV/c and over rapidity in the range {pipe}y{pipe} < 2.4, the measured cross sections, times the dimuon decay branching fraction, are 70.9 ± 2.1(stat.) ± 3.0(syst.) ± 7.8(luminosity) nb for prompt J/ψ mesons assuming unpolarized production and 26.0 ± 1.4(stat.) ± 1.6(syst.) ± 2.9(luminosity) nb for J/ψ mesons from b-hadron decays. © CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration 2011.

84860360064	Search for microscopic black holes in pp collisions at √ s = 7 TeV	A search for microscopic black holes in pp collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7TeV is presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 fb1 recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011. Events with large total transverse energy have been analyzed for the presence of multiple energetic jets, leptons, and photons, which are typical signals of evaporating semiclassical and quantum black holes, and string balls. Agreement with the expected standard model backgrounds, which are dominated by QCD multijet production, has been observed for various combined multiplicities of jets and other reconstructed objects in the final state. Model-independent limits are set on new physics processes producing high-multiplicity, energetic final states. In addition, new model-specific indicative limits are set excluding semiclassical and quantum black holes with masses below 3.8 to 5.3TeV and string balls with masses below 4.6 to 4.8TeV . The analysis has a substantially increased sensitivity compared to previous searches.

84863282065	Measurement of the underlying event activity at the LHC with √s = 7 TeV and comparison with √s = 0:9 TeV	A measurement of the underlying activity in events with a jet of transverse momentum in the several GeV region is performed in proton-proton collisions at √ s = 0:9 and 7TeV, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The production of charged particles with pseudorapidity |η|<2 and transverse momentum pT >0:5 GeV/c is studied in the azimuthal region transverse to that of the leading set of charged particles forming a track-jet. A significant growth of the average multiplicity and scalar-pT sum of the particles in the transverse region is observed with increasing pT of the leading trackjet, followed by a much slower rise above a few GeV/c. For track-jet pT larger than a few GeV/c, the activity in the transverse region is approximately doubled with a centreof- mass energy increase from 0:9 to 7TeV. Predictions of several QCD-inspired models as implemented in pythia are compared to the data.

84868541278	Measurement of jet fragmentation into charged particles in pp and PbPb collisions at √s 	Jet fragmentation in pp and PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 2.76TeV per nucleon pair was studied using data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. Fragmentation functions are constructed using charged-particle tracks with transverse momenta pT > 4 GeV/c for dijet events with a leading jet of pT > 100 GeV/c. The fragmentation functions in PbPb events are compared to those in pp data as a function of collision centrality, as well as dijet-pT imbalance. Special emphasis is placed on the most central PbPb events including dijets with unbalanced momentum, indicative of energy loss of the hard scattered parent partons. The fragmentation patterns for both the leading and subleading jets in PbPb collisions agree with those seen in pp data at 2.76TeV. The results provide evidence that, despite the large parton energy loss observed in PbPb collisions, the partition of the remaining momentum within the jet cone into high-pT particles is not strongly modified in comparison to that observed for jets in vacuum.

84871443529	A new Boson with a mass of 125 GeV observed with the CMS experiment at the large hadron collider	The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup>, and Z <sup>0</sup> bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.

This search is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 5.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of proton-proton collisions collected in the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. For sufficiently heavy resonances the decay products of each vector boson are merged into a single jet, and the event effectively has a dijet topology. The background from QCD dijet events is reduced using recently developed techniques that resolve jet substructure. A 95% CL lower limit is set on the mass of excited quark resonances decaying into qW (qZ) at 2.38 TeV (2.15 TeV) and upper limits are set on the cross section for resonances decaying to qW, qZ, WW, WZ, or ZZ final states.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1 and was collected at s=8TeV by the CMS experiment. No significant excess is observed in the data above the expected background, and the existence of top-quark partners with masses below 800 GeV is excluded at a 95% confidence level, assuming they decay exclusively to tW.

Expressed in terms of the Fourier components of the azimuthal distribution, the n=3-6 harmonic coefficients are presented for charged particles as a function of their transverse momentum (0.3<pT<8.0GeV/c), collision centrality (0%-70%), and pseudorapidity (|η|<2.0). The data are analyzed using the event plane, multiparticle cumulant, and Lee-Yang zeros methods, which provide different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. Taken together with earlier LHC measurements of elliptic flow (n=2), the results on higher-order harmonic coefficients develop a more complete picture of the collective motion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions and shed light on the properties of the produced medium. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84907266414	Evidence of b -jet quenching in PbPb collisions at sNN =2.76TeV	The production of jets associated to bottom quarks is measured for the first time in PbPb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair. Jet spectra are reported in the transverse momentum (pT) range of 80-250GeV/c, and within pseudorapidity |η|<2. The nuclear modification factor (RAA) calculated from these spectra shows a strong suppression in the b-jet yield in PbPb collisions relative to the yield observed in pp collisions at the same energy. The suppression persists to the largest values of pT studied, and is centrality dependent. The RAA is about 0.4 in the most central events, similar to previous observations for inclusive jets. This implies that jet quenching does not have a strong dependence on parton mass and flavor in the jet pT range studied.

84914697722	Search for supersymmetry with razor variables in pp collisions at s =7TeV	The razor approach to search for R-parity conserving supersymmetric particles is described in detail. Two analyses are considered: an inclusive search for new heavy particle pairs decaying to final states with at least two jets and missing transverse energy, and a dedicated search for final states with at least one jet originating from a bottom quark. For both the inclusive study and the study requiring a bottom-quark jet, the data are examined in exclusive final states corresponding to all-hadronic, single-lepton, and dilepton events. The study is based on the data set of proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1. The study consists of a shape analysis performed in the plane of two kinematic variables, denoted MR and R2, that correspond to the mass and transverse energy flow, respectively, of pair-produced, heavy, new-physics particles. The data are found to be compatible with the background model, defined by studying event simulations and data control samples. Exclusion limits for squark and gluino production are derived in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) and also for simplified-model spectra (SMS). Within the CMSSM parameter space considered, squark and gluino masses up to 1350 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, depending on the model parameters. For SMS scenarios, the direct production of pairs of top or bottom squarks is excluded for masses as high as 400 GeV.

84920513310	Searches for electroweak production of charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons decaying to leptons and W, Z, and Higgs bosons in pp collisions at 8 TeV	Searches for the direct electroweak production of supersymmetric charginos, neutralinos, and sleptons in a variety of signatures with leptons and W, Z, and Higgs bosons are presented. Results are based on a sample of proton-proton collision data collected at center-of-mass energy (Formula Presented.) with the CMS detector in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5 (Formula Presented.). The observed event rates are in agreement with expectations from the standard model. These results probe charginos and neutralinos with masses up to 720 (Formula Presented.), and sleptons up to 260 (Formula Presented.), depending on the model details.

84919906986	Observation of the diphoton decay of the Higgs boson and measurement of its properties	Observation of the diphoton decay mode of the recently discovered Higgs boson and measurement of some of its properties are reported. The analysis uses the entire dataset collected by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions during the 2011 and 2012 LHC running periods. The data samples correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.1(Equation Present) and 19.7(Equation Present). A clear signal is observed in the diphoton channel at a mass close to 125(Equation Present)A with a local significance of (Equation Present), where a significance of (Equation Present) is expected for the standard model Higgs boson. The mass is measured to be (Equation Present), and the best-fit signal strength relative to the standard model prediction is (Equation Present). Additional measurements include the signal strength modifiers associated with different production mechanisms, and hypothesis tests between spin-0 and spin-2 models.

84919915970	Searches for heavy Higgs bosons in two-Higgs-doublet models and for t →ch decay using multilepton and diphoton final states in pp collisions at 8 TeV searches for heavy Higgs bosons in two-Higgs- ... V. Khachatryan et al.	Searches are presented for heavy scalar (H) and pseudoscalar (A) Higgs bosons posited in the two doublet model (2HDM) extensions of the standard model (SM). These searches are based on a data sample of pp collisions collected with the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of s=8TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1. The decays H→hh and A→Zh, where h denotes an SM-like Higgs boson, lead to events with three or more isolated charged leptons or with a photon pair accompanied by one or more isolated leptons. The search results are presented in terms of the H and A production cross sections times branching fractions and are further interpreted in terms of 2HDM parameters. We place 95% C.L. cross section upper limits of approximately 7 pb on σB for H→hh and 2 pb for A→Zh. Also presented are the results of a search for the rare decay of the top quark that results in a charm quark and an SM Higgs boson, t→ch, the existence of which would indicate a nonzero flavor-changing Yukawa coupling of the top quark to the Higgs boson. We place a 95% C.L. upper limit of 0.56% on B(t→ch).

84919926013	Measurement of pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in proton–proton collisions at (Equation Present) TeV by the CMS and TOTEM experiments	Pseudorapidity (Equation Present) distributions of charged particles produced in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8(Equation Present) are measured in the ranges (Equation Present) and (Equation Present) covered by the CMS and TOTEM detectors, respectively. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of (Equation Present). Measurements are presented for three event categories. The most inclusive category is sensitive to 91–96 % of the total inelastic proton–proton cross section. The other two categories are disjoint subsets of the inclusive sample that are either enhanced or depleted in single diffractive dissociation events. The data are compared to models used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions. None of the models considered provide a consistent description of the measured distributions.

84922833302	Measurement of jet fragmentation in PbPb and pp collisions at s NN =2.76 TeV	The jet fragmentation function of inclusive jets with transverse momentum pT above 100GeV/c in PbPb collisions has been measured using reconstructed charged particles with pT above 1GeV/c in a cone of radius 0.3 around the jet axis. A data sample of PbPb collisions collected in 2011 at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of sNN=2.76TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150μb-1 is used. The results for PbPb collisions as a function of collision centrality and jet transverse momentum are compared to reference distributions based on pp data collected at the same center-of-mass energy in 2013, with an integrated luminosity of 5.3pb-1. A centrality-dependent modification of the fragmentation function is found. For the most central collisions, a significant enhancement is observed in the PbPb/pp fragmentation function ratio for charged particles with pT less than 3GeV/c. This enhancement is observed for all jet pT bins studied. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834050	Search for anomalous production of events with three or more leptons in pp collisions at s =8TeV	A search for physics beyond the standard model in events with at least three leptons is presented. The data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5fb-1 of proton-proton collisions with center-of-mass energy s=8TeV, was collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC during 2012. The data are divided into exclusive categories based on the number of leptons and their flavor, the presence or absence of an opposite-sign, same-flavor lepton pair (OSSF), the invariant mass of the OSSF pair, the presence or absence of a tagged bottom-quark jet, the number of identified hadronically decaying τ leptons, and the magnitude of the missing transverse energy and of the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta. The numbers of observed events are found to be consistent with the expected numbers from standard model processes, and limits are placed on new-physics scenarios that yield multilepton final states. In particular, scenarios that predict Higgs boson production in the context of supersymmetric decay chains are examined. We also place a 95% confidence level upper limit of 1.3% on the branching fraction for the decay of a top quark to a charm quark and a Higgs boson (t→cH), which translates to a bound on the left- and right-handed top-charm flavor-violating Higgs Yukawa couplings, λtcH and λctH, respectively, of |λtcH|2+|λctH|2<0.21. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834125	Search for jet extinction in the inclusive jet-pT spectrum from proton-proton collisions at s=8TeV	The first search at the LHC for the extinction of QCD jet production is presented, using data collected with the CMS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The extinction model studied in this analysis is motivated by the search for signatures of strong gravity at the TeV scale (terascale gravity) and assumes the existence of string couplings in the strong-coupling limit. In this limit, the string model predicts the suppression of all high-transverse-momentum standard model processes, including jet production, beyond a certain energy scale. To test this prediction, the measured transverse-momentum spectrum is compared to the theoretical prediction of the standard model. No significant deficit of events is found at high transverse momentum. A 95% confidence level lower limit of 3.3 TeV is set on the extinction mass scale. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922834193	Measurement of the muon charge asymmetry in inclusive pp →w+X production at s =7TeV and an improved determination of light parton distribution functions	Measurements of the muon charge asymmetry in inclusive pp→W+X production at s=7TeV are presented. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1 recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. With a sample of more than 20 million W→μν events, the statistical precision is greatly improved in comparison to previous measurements. These new results provide additional constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton in the range of the Bjorken scaling variable x from 10-3 to 10-1. These measurements and the recent CMS measurement of associated W+charm production are used together with the cross sections for inclusive deep inelastic e±p scattering at HERA in a next-to-leading-order QCD analysis. The determination of the valence quark distributions is improved, and the strange-quark distribution is probed directly through the leading-order process g+s→W+c in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84922959119	Determination of the top-quark pole mass and strong coupling constant from the tt̄ production cross section in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV	The inclusive cross section for top-quark pair production measured by the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is compared to the QCD prediction at next-to-next-to-leading order with various parton distribution functions to determine the top-quark pole mass, m<inf>t</inf> <sup>pole</sup>, or the strong coupling constant, α<inf>S</inf>. With the parton distribution function set NNPDF2.3, a pole mass of 176. 7<sup>+3.8</sup> <inf>-3.4</inf>GeV is obtained when constraining α<inf>S</inf>at the scale of the Z boson mass, m<inf>Z</inf>, to the current world average. Alternatively, by constraining m<inf>t</inf> <sup>pole</sup>to the latest average from direct mass measurements, a value of α<inf>S</inf>(m<inf>Z</inf>) = 0. 1151<sup>+0.0033</sup> <inf>-0.0032</inf>is extracted.

84924025032	Search for WWγ and WZγ production and constraints on anomalous quartic gauge couplings in pp collisions at s =8TeV	A search for WVγ triple vector boson production is presented based on events containing a W boson decaying to a muon or an electron and a neutrino, a second V (W or Z) boson, and a photon. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 19.3fb-1 collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC in pp collisions at s=8TeV. An upper limit of 311 fb on the cross section for the WVγ production process is obtained at 95% confidence level for photons with a transverse energy above 30 GeV and with an absolute value of pseudorapidity of less than 1.44. This limit is approximately a factor of 3.4 larger than the standard model predictions that are based on next-to-leading order QCD calculations. Since no evidence of anomalous WWγγ or WWZγ quartic gauge boson couplings is found, this paper presents the first experimental limits on the dimension-eight parameter fT,0 and the CP-conserving WWZγ parameters κ0W and κCW. Limits are also obtained for the WWγγ parameters a0W and aCW. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

84924620013	Searches for electroweak neutralino and chargino production in channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons in pp collisions at 8 TeV	Searches for supersymmetry (SUSY) are presented based on the electroweak pair production of neutralinos and charginos, leading to decay channels with Higgs, Z, and W bosons and undetected lightest SUSY particles (LSPs). The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 19.5fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected in 2012 with the CMS detector at the LHC. The main emphasis is neutralino pair production in which each neutralino decays either to a Higgs boson (h) and an LSP or to a Z boson and an LSP, leading to hh, hZ, and ZZ states with missing transverse energy (ETmiss). A second aspect is chargino-neutralino pair production, leading to hW states with ETmiss. The decays of a Higgs boson to a bottom-quark pair, to a photon pair, and to final states with leptons are considered in conjunction with hadronic and leptonic decay modes of the Z and W bosons. No evidence is found for supersymmetric particles, and 95% confidence level upper limits are evaluated for the respective pair production cross sections and for neutralino and chargino mass values.

84925595714	Evidence for the 125 gev higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons	A search for a standard model Higgs boson decaying into a pair of τ leptons is performed using events recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011 and 2012. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb<sup>-1</sup> at a centre-of-mass energy of 7TeV and 19.7fb<sup>-1</sup> at 8TeV. Each τ lepton decays hadronically or leptonically to an electron or a muon, leading to six different final states for the τ-lepton pair, all considered in this analysis. An excess of events is observed over the expected background contributions, with a local significance larger than 3 standard deviations for mH values between 115 and 130 GeV. The best fit of the observed H → ττ signal cross section times branching fraction for m<inf>H</inf> = 125 GeV is 0.78±0.27 times the standard model expectation. These observations constitute evidence for the 125 GeV Higgs boson decaying to a pair of τ leptons.
