0031574504	Asset allocation with time variation in expected returns	This paper analyzes the consumption investment problem of a risk averse investor in continuous time when there are several asset classes. The classic paper in this area is due to Merton who solved the problem when the returns were assumed to be stationary. We assume that there is time variation in the expected returns on the different assets and that this time variation arises from movements in the underlying state variables. We formulate the investor's decision as a problem in optimal stochastic control. Our work extends the paper by Brennan et al. (1997) to incorporate a different interest rate process. In addition we investigate the impact of transaction costs on the stock. We employ a viscosity solution approach to the problem and to guarantee a solution we need to impose strong assumptions.

27144473473	Ruin in the perturbed compound Poisson risk process under interest force	In this paper, we study ruin in a perturbed compound Poisson risk process under stochastic interest force and constant interest force. By using the technique of stochastic control, we show that the ruin probability in the perturbed risk model is always twice continuously differentiable provided that claim sizes have continuous density functions. In the perturbed risk model, ruin may be caused by a claim or by oscillation. We decompose the ruin probability into the sum of two ruin probabilities; one is the probability that ruin is caused by a claim and the other is the probability that ruin is caused by oscillation. Integrodifferential equations for these ruin probabilities are derived when the interest force is constant. When the claim sizes are exponentially distributed, explicit solutions of the ruin probabilities are derived from the integrodifferential equations. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effects of diffusion volatility and interest force on the ruin probabilities. © Applied Probability Trust 2005.

29144449796	Optimal investment for insurer with jump-diffusion risk process	In this paper, we study optimal investment policies of an insurer with jump-diffusion risk process. Under the assumptions that the risk process is compound Poisson process perturbed by a standard Brownian motion and the insurer can invest in the money market and in a risky asset, we obtain the close form expression of the optimal policy when the utility function is exponential. We also study the insurer's optimal policy for general objective function, a verification theorem is proved by using martingale optimality principle and Ito's formula for jump-diffusion process. In the case of minimizing ruin probability, numerical methods and numerical results are presented for various claim-size distributions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

29144495786	Optimal stopping behavior of equity-linked investment products with regime switching	In recent years, there is a growing interest in equity-linked investment products. The return credited to such product depends on the return of some underlying reference index. A prominent example is the equity-indexed annuities (EIAs). A special feature of many of the equity-linked products is that the holders are entitled the right to surrender the product prior to maturity. In this paper, we will study the optimal surrender time for a equity-linked product in a discrete-time setting. We assume that the market environment will switch among different regimes in a Markovian way, and the return of the reference index will have different distributions in different regimes. Assuming a CRRA preference, we have obtained the optimal surrender policy. Properties of the optimal surrender behavior, in particular the effect of regime switching, are examined. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

27744517972	On Erlang(2) risk process perturbed by diffusion	In thi s article, we consider an Erlang(2) risk process perturbed by diffusion. From the extreme value distribution of Brownian motion with drift and the renewal theory, we show that the survival probability satisfies an integral equation. We then give the bounds for the ultimate ruin probability and the ruin probability caused by claim. By introducing a random walk associated with the proposed risk process, we define an adjustment-coefficient. The relation between the adjustment-coefficient and the bound is given and the Lundberg-type inequality for the bound is obtained. Also, a formula of Pollaczek-Khinchin type for the bound is derived. Using these results, the bound can be calculated when claim sizes are exponentially distributed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis, Inc.

33745182285	Development of pulsed high current drivers for fast Z-pinch	It is required that the peak current of high power pulsed driver for fast Z-pinch reaches 60 MA to realize inertial confine fusion (ICF) and high yield (HY). With the conventional technological methods similar to the Z or Saturn apparatus, increasing driver current further is impractical and difficult according to the cost, structure complexity and reliability of the driver, so it is necessary to develop novel fast pulsed high current driver. The present art-of-state and trends of fast Z-pinch driver are summarized in the paper, and the typical conceptual designs and technological methods on ICF/HY PRS (plasma radiation source) and destroying-level super X-ray simulators in USA and Russia are outlined, such as HCEI's UGXX1 driver and new Saturn driver based on fast linear transformer driver (FLTD) and novel driver based on fast Marx generator (FMG) with current of 15 MA. The crucial technological problems and requirements to investigate in the future are presented.

33749501719	On Bayesian value at risk: From linear to non-linear portfolios	This paper proposes the use of Bayesian approach to implement Value at Risk (VaR) model for both linear and non-linear portfolios. The Bayesian approach provides risk traders with the flexibility of adjusting their VaR models according to their subjective views. First, we deal with the case of linear portfolios. By imposing the conjugate-prior assumptions, a closed-form expression for the Bayesian VaR is obtained. The Bayesian VaR model can also be adjusted in order to deal with the ageing effect of the past data. By adopting Gerber-Shiu's option-pricing model, our Bayesian VaR model can also be applied to deal with non-linear portfolios of derivatives. We obtain an exact formula for the Bayesian VaR in the case of a single European call option. We adopt the method of back-testing to compare the non-adjusted and adjusted Bayesian VaR models with their corresponding classica' counterparts in both linear and non-linear cases. © Springer 2006.

Instead of using the classical variance as usual, we use earnings-at-risk (EaR) of terminal wealth as a measure of risk. In the settings of Black-Scholes type financial markets and constantly-rebalanced portfolio (CRP) investment strategies, we obtain closed-form expressions for the best CRP investment strategy and the efficient frontier of the mean-EaR problem, and compare our mean-EaR analysis to the classical mean-variance analysis and to the mean-CaR (capital-at-risk) analysis. We also examine some economic implications arising from using the mean-EaR model. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

34547642290	Experimental study on magnetizing property of magnetic core for LTD	This paper studies the pulsed magnetizing property of annealing metglass and silicon steel core with polymer foil between layers fitted to the linear transformer driver (LTD). The capacitor fast discharge method was used to acquire a pulse with about 20 ns rise time and measure the magnetizing properties of annealing metglass 2605SA1 and silicon sted DG6. Through measuring primary current and secondary coil opened voltage, magnetic core hysteresis loops have been drawn. After the experiment, relative permeability was obtained in different dB/dt. The results indicate that the relative permeability is decreased with the increase of dB/dt. The relative permeability of annealing metglas 2605SAl is less than 1000 when dB/dt is more than 20 T/μs and that of silicon steel DG6 is less than 1000 when dB/dt is more than 4 T/μs.

35348840445	On Bayesian mixture credibility	We introduce a class of Bayesian infinite mixture models first introduced by Lo (1984) to determine the credibility premium for a non-homogeneous insurance portfolio. The Bayesian infinite mixture models provide us with much flexibility in the specification of the claim distribution. We employ the sampling scheme based on a weighted Chinese restaurant process introduced in Lo et al. (1996) to estimate a Bayesian infinite mixture model from the claim data. The Bayesian sampling scheme also provides a systematic way to cluster the claim data. This can provide some insights into the risk characteristics of the policyholders. The estimated credibility premium from the Bayesian infinite mixture model can be written as a linear combination of the prior estimate and the sample mean of the claim data. Estimation results for the Bayesian mixture credibility premiums will be presented. © 2006 by Astin Bulletin. All rights reserved.

35348889157	A note on the dividends-penalty identity and the optimal dividend barrier	For a general class of risk models, the dividends-penalty identity is derived by probabilistic reasoning. This identity is the key for understanding and determining the optimal dividend barrier, which maximizes the difference between the expected present value of all dividends until ruin and the expected discounted value of a penalty at ruin (which is typically a function of the deficit at ruin). As an illustration, the optimal barrier is calculated in two classical models, for different penalty functions and a variety of parameter values. © 2006 by Astin Bulletin. All rights reserved.

38649142963	Lundberg-type bounds for the joint distribution of surplus immediately before and at ruin under the sparre andersen model	In this paper we consider the Sparre Andersen insurance risk model. Three cases are discussed: the ordinary renewal risk process, stationary renewal risk process, and s-delayed renewal risk process. In the first part of the paper we study the joint distribution of surplus immediately before and at ruin under the renewal insurance risk model. By constructing an exponential martingale, we obtain Lundberg-type upper bounds for the joint distribution. Consequently we obtain bounds for the distribution of the deficit at ruin and ruin probability. In the second part of the paper, we consider the special case of phase-type claims and rederive the closed-form expression for the distribution of the severity of ruin, obtained by Drekic et al. (2003, 2004). Finally, we present some numerical results to illustrate the tightness of the bounds obtained in this paper.

38649096282	Ruin theory for a Markov regime-switching model under a threshold dividend strategy	In this paper, we study a Markov regime-switching risk model where dividends are paid out according to a certain threshold strategy depending on the underlying Markovian environment process. We are interested in these quantities: ruin probabilities, deficit at ruin and expected ruin time. To study them, we introduce functions involving the deficit at ruin and the indicator of the event that ruin occurs. We show that the above functions and the expectations of the time to ruin as functions of the initial capital satisfy systems of integro-differential equations. Closed form solutions are derived when the underlying Markovian environment process has only two states and the claim size distributions are exponential. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

41149088113	On valuing participating life insurance contracts with conditional heteroscedasticity	In this paper, we consider a novel approach for the fair valuation of a participating life insurance policy when the dynamics of the reference portfolio underlying the policy are governed by an Asymmetric Power GARCH (APGARCH) model with innovations having a general parametric distribution. The APGARCH model provides a flexible way to incorporate the effect of conditional heteroscedasticity or time-varying conditional volatility and nests a number of important symmetric or asymmetric ARCH-type models in the literature. It also provides a flexible way to capture both the memory effect of the conditional volatility and the asymmetric effects of past positive and negative returns on the current conditional volatility, called the leverage effect. The key valuation tool here is the conditional Esscher transform of Bühlmann et al. (1996, 1998). The conditional Esscher transform provides a convenient and flexible way for the fair valuation under different specifications of the conditional heteroscedastic models. We illustrate the practical implementation of the model using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the reference portfolio. We also conduct sensitivity analysis of the fair value of the policy with respect to the parameters in the APGARCH model to document the impacts of different conditional volatility models nested in the APGARCH model and the leverage effect on the fair value. The results of the analysis reveal that the memory effect of the conditional volatility has more significant impact on the fair value of the policy than the leverage effect. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Assuming that the interclaim times follow a Coxian distribution, we show that the Laplace transforms and defective renewal equations for the Gerber-Shiu functions can be obtained by employing the roots of a generalized Lundberg equation. When the SNLP is a combination of a Brownian motion and a compound Poisson process with exponential jumps, explicit expressions and asymptotic formulas for the Gerber-Shiu functions are obtained for exponential claim size distribution and heavy-tailed claim size distribution, respectively. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

46449103797	Insurance claims modulated by a hidden marked point process	Recently Markov-modulated compound Poisson models have gained its popularity in modelling insurance claims in the actuarial science literature. A Markov-modulated compound Poisson model can provide a realistic and flexibile way to model aggregate insurance claims by incorporating the impact of hidden states of an economy on claim frequencies and claim sizes. However, in practice, the Markov chain in the model is not observable. It is of practical interest to develop some methods to estimate the hidden state of the Markov chain and other unknown model parameters of the Markov-modulated compound Poisson model. This paper considers this important issue. We shall develop filters and smoothers for the hidden state of the economy underlying the Markov-modulated compound Poisson model. In general, we consider the case when both the stochastic intensity and the distribution of the claim sizes of the compound Poisson process depend on the hidden Markov chain. The filter and smoother provide an optimal way to estimate the insurance claims model in the "mean-squared- error" sense. We shall also develop estimators for the unknown model parameters of the Markov-modulated marked point process using the robust filter-based and smoother-based EM algorithms. © 2007 IEEE.

52749090722	Optimal dividends in an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type model with credit and debit interest	In the absence of investment and dividend payments, the surplus is modeled by a Brownian motion. But now assume that the surplus earns investment income at a constant rate of credit interest. Dividends are paid to the shareholders according to a barrier strategy. It is shown how the expected discounted value of the dividends and the optimal dividend barrier can be calculated; Kummer's confluent hypergeometric differential equation plays a key role in this context. An alternative assumption is that business can go on after ruin, as long as it is profitable. When the surplus is negative, a higher rate of debit interest is applied. Several numerical examples document the influence of the parameters on the optimal dividend strategy.

A new approach based on stochastic optimization methods is developed. Compared with the existing results in the literature, more general surplus processes are considered. Precise models of the surplus need not be known; only noise-corrupted observations of the dividends are used. Using barrier-type strategies, a class of stochastic optimization algorithms are developed. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed; rate of convergence is also provided. Numerical results are reported to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

55549125210	Estimates for the absolute ruin probability in the compound Poisson risk model with credit and debit interest	In this paper we consider a compound Poisson risk model where the insurer earns credit interest at a constant rate if the surplus is positive and pays out debit interest at another constant rate if the surplus is negative. Absolute ruin occurs at the moment when the surplus first drops below a critical value (a negative constant). We study the asymptotic properties of the absolute ruin probability of this model. First we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the absolute ruin probability when the claim size distribution is light tailed. Then we study the case where the common distribution of claim sizes are heavy tailed. © Applied Probability Trust 2003.

56549111181	Pricing currency options under two-factor Markov-modulated stochastic volatility models	This article investigates the valuation of currency options when the dynamic of the spot Foreign Exchange (FX) rate is governed by a two-factor Markov-modulated stochastic volatility model, with the first stochastic volatility component driven by a lognormal diffusion process and the second independent stochastic volatility component driven by a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain model. The states of the Markov chain can be interpreted as the states of an economy. We employ the regime-switching Esscher transform to determine a martingale pricing measure for valuing currency options under the incomplete market setting. We consider the valuation of the European-style and American-style currency options. In the case of American options, we provide a decomposition result for the American option price into the sum of its European counterpart and the early exercise premium.

We suppose that the drift and volatility of the underlying risky asset are modulated by an observable continuous-time, finite-state Markov chain. We develop a two-stage pricing model which can price both the diffusion risk and the regime-switching risk based on the Esscher transform and the minimization of the maximum entropy between an equivalent martingale measure and the real-world probability measure over different states. Numerical experiments are conducted and their results reveal that the impact of pricing regime-switching risk on the option prices is significant. © 2009 The Editorial Office of AMAS & Springer-Verlag 2009.

In this paper, a novel multiple-receiver SAS signal model is proposed on the background of high mapping rate and wide swath, and then a method of variational non-uniform sampling reconstruction is presented without the approximation of stop-and-hop using the method of frequency domain. A fast algorithm of reconstruction is also proposed, which has the same computation complex level with FFT. The proposed method can avoid the excursion and defocusing in the SAS imaging process with high mapping rate and wide swath. The simulation and trial results show the validity of this method.

72949090375	Option pricing in a jump-diffusion model with regime switching	Nowadays, the regime switching model has become a popular model in mathematical finance and actuarial science. The market is not complete when the model has regime switching. Thus, pricing the regime switching risk is an important issue. In Naik (1993), a jump diffusion model with two regimes is studied. In this paper, we extend the model of Naik (1993) to a multi-regime case. We present a trinomial tree method to price options in the extended model. Our results show that the trinomial tree method in this paper is an effective method; it is very fast and easy to implement. Compared with the existing methodologies, the proposed method has an obvious advantage when one needs to price exotic options and the number of regime states is large. Various numerical examples are presented to illustrate the ideas and methodologies. © 2009 by Astin Bulletin. All rights reserved.

74249092485	An elementary approach to discrete models of dividend strategies	The paper studies a discrete counterpart of Gerber et al. (2006). The surplus of an insurance company (before dividends) is modeled as a time-homogeneous Markov chain with possible changes of size + 1, 0, - 1, - 2, - 3, .... If a barrier strategy is applied for paying dividends, it is shown that the dividends-penalty identity holds. The identity expresses the expected present value of a penalty at ruin in terms of the expected discounted dividends until ruin and the expected present value of the penalty at ruin if no dividends are paid. For the problem of maximizing the difference between the expected discounted dividends until ruin and the expected present value of the penalty at ruin, barrier strategies play a prominent role. In some cases an optimal dividend barrier exists. The paper discusses in detail the special case where the distribution of the change in surplus does not depend on the current surplus (so that in the absence of dividends the surplus process has independent increments). A closed-form result for zero initial surplus is given, and it is shown how the relevant quantities can be calculated recursively. Finally, it is shown how optimal dividend strategies can be determined; typically, they are band strategies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Actuarial J. 2003; 7:37-51) to a regimeswitching case. The market mode is modeled by a continuous-time stationary Markov chain. The asset value process and liability value process are modeled by Markov-modulated geometric Brownian motions. We consider a pension funding plan in which the asset value is to be within a band that is proportional to the liability value. The pension plan sponsor is asked to provide sufficient funds to guarantee the asset value stays above the lower barrier of the band. The amount by which the asset value exceeds the upper barrier will be paid back to the sponsor. By applying differential equation approach, this paper calculates the expected present value of the payments to be made by the sponsor as well as that of the refunds to the sponsor. In addition, we study the effects of different barriers and regime switching on the results using some numerical examples. The optimal dividend problem is studied in our examples as an application of our theory. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

77955655390	Upper comonotonicity and convex upper bounds for sums of random variables	It is well-known that if a random vector with given marginal distributions is comonotonic, it has the largest sum with respect to convex order. However, replacing the (unknown) copula by the comonotonic copula will in most cases not reflect reality well. For instance, in an insurance context we may have partial information about the dependence structure of different risks in the lower tail. In this paper, we extend the aforementioned result, using the concept of upper comonotonicity, to the case where the dependence structure of a random vector in the lower tail is already known. Since upper comonotonic random vectors have comonotonic behavior in the upper tail, we are able to extend several well-known results of comonotonicity to upper comonotonicity. As an application, we construct different increasing convex upper bounds for sums of random variables and compare these bounds in terms of increasing convex order. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We assume that the claim inter-arrivals, claim sizes and premium process are influenced by an external Markovian environment process. The considered tax rule, which is the same as the one considered by Albrecher and Hipp [Blätter DGVFM 28(1):13-28, 2007], is to pay a certain proportion of the premium income, whenever the insurer is in a profitable situation. A system of differential equations of the non-ruin probabilities, given the initial environment state, are established in terms of the ruin probabilities under the Markov-modulated insurance risk model without tax. Furthermore, given the initial state, the differential equations satisfied by the expected accumulated discounted tax until ruin are also derived. We also give the analytical expressions for them by iteration methods. © 2010 DAV / DGVFM.

77955161315	Multiperiod optimal investment consumption strategies with mortality risk and environment uncertainty	In this article we investigate three related investment-consumption problems for a risk-averse investor: (1) an investment-only problem that involves utility from only terminal wealth, (2) an investment-consumption problem that involves utility from only consumption, and (3) an extended investment-consumption problem that involves utility from both consumption and terminal wealth. Although these problems have been studied quite extensively in continuous-time frameworks, we focus on discrete time. Our contributions are (1) to model these investmentconsumption problems using a discrete model that incorporates the environment risk and mortality risk, in addition to the market risk that is typically considered, and (2) to derive explicit expressions of the optimal investment-consumption strategies to these modeled problems. Furthermore, economic implications of our results are presented. It is reassuring that many of our findings are consistent with the well-known results from the continuous-time models, even though our models have the additional features of modeling the environment uncertainty and the uncertain exit time.

77956461735	Asymptotically optimal dividend policy for regime-switching compound Poisson models	This work develops asymptotically optimal dividend policies to maximize the expected present value of dividends until ruin. Compound Poisson processes with regime switching are used to model the surplus and the switching (a continuous-time controlled Markov chain) represents random environment and other economic conditions. Assuming the switching to be fast varying together with suitable conditions, it is shown that the system has a limit that is an average with respect to the invariant measure of a related Markov chain. Under simple conditions, the optimal policy of the limit dividend strategy is a threshold policy. Using the optimal policy of the limit system as a guide, feedback control for the original surplus is then developed. It is demonstrated that the constructed dividend policy is asymptotically optimal. © 2010 Institute of Applied Mathematics, Academy of Mathematics and System Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956601405	Pricing asian options and equity-indexed annuities with regime switching by the trinomial tree method	Equity-indexed annuities (EIAs) provide investors with a minimum rate of return and at the same time the opportunity of gaining a profit that is linked to the performance of an equity index. These properties make EIAs a popular product in the market. For modeling the equity index process and calculating the price of EIAs, as the maturity of EIAs usually is long, it is more reasonable to assume that the interest rate and the volatility of the equity index are stochastic processes. One simple way is to apply the regime-switching model, which allows these parameters depending on the market situation. However, the valuation of derivatives in such models is challenging, especially for the strong path-dependent options such as Asian options. A trinomial tree model is introduced to provide an efficient way to solve this problem. The valuation of Asian options is studied and extended to Asian-option-related EIAs.

Such a model might be appropriate for a company that specializes in inventions and discoveries, which pays costs continuously and has occasional profits. Assuming proportional transaction costs, we aim at finding optimal strategy which maximizes the expected present value of the dividends payout minus the discounted costs of issuing new equity before bankruptcy. By adopting some of the techniques and methodologies in LØkka and Zervos (2008), we construct two categories of suboptimal models, one is the ordinary dual model without issuance of equity, the other one assumes that, by issuing new equity, the company never goes bankrupt. We identify the value functions and the optimal strategies corresponding to the suboptimal models in two different cases. For exponentially distributed jump sizes, closed-form solutions are obtained.

By adapting the techniques and methods of stochastic control, we study the quasi-variational inequality for this classical and impulse control problem and establish a verification theorem. We show that the optimal value function is characterized as the unique viscosity solution of the corresponding quasi-variational inequality. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

79951706640	Markowitz's mean-variance asset-liability management with regime switching: A multi-period model	This paper considers an optimal portfolio selection problem under Markowitz's meanvariance portfolio selection problem in a multi-period regime-switching model. We assume that there are n + 1 securities in the market. Given an economic state which is modelled by a finite state Markov chain, the return of each security at a fixed time point is a random variable. The return random variables may be different if the economic state is changed even for the same security at the same time point. We start our analysis from the no-liability case, in the spirit of Li and Ng (2000), both the optimal investment strategy and the efficient frontier are derived. Then we add uncontrollable liability into the model. By direct comparison with the no-liability case, the optimal strategy can be derived explicitly. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

79952187704	Optimal dividend and capital injection problem in the dual model with proportional and fixed transaction costs	In this paper we consider the dividend payments and capital injections control problem in a dual risk model. Such a model might be appropriate for a company that specializes in inventions and discoveries, which pays costs continuously and has occasional profits. The objective is to maximize the expected present value of the dividends minus the discounted costs of capital injections. This paper can be considered as an extension of Yao et al. (2010), we include fixed transaction costs incurred by capital injections in this paper. This leads to an impulse control problem. Using the techniques of quasi-variational inequalities (QVI), this optimal control problem is solved. Numerical solutions are provided to illustrate the idea and methodologies, and some interesting economic insights are included. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79953135193	On the absolute ruin in a MAP risk model with debit interest	In this paper we consider a risk model where claims arrive according to a Markovian arrival process (MAP). When the surplus becomes negative or the insurer is in deficit, the insurer could borrow money at a constant debit interest rate to repay the claims. We derive the integro-differential equations satisfied by the discounted penalty functions and discuss the solutions. A matrix renewal equation is obtained for the discounted penalty function provided that the initial surplus is nonnegative. Based on this matrix renewal equation, we present some asymptotic formulae for the discounted penalty functions when the claim size distributions are heavy tailed. © Applied Probability Trust 2011.

79954542362	A direct approach to the discounted penalty function	This paper provides a new and accessible approach to establishing certain results concerning the discounted penalty function. The direct approach consists of two steps. In the first step, closedform expressions are obtained in the special case in which the claim amount distribution is a combination of exponential distributions. A rational function is useful in this context. For the second step, one observes that the family of combinations of exponential distributions is dense. Hence, it suffices to reformulate the results of the first step to obtain general results. The surplus process has downward and upward jumps, modeled by two independent compound Poisson processes. If the distribution of the upward jumps is exponential, a series of new results can be obtained with ease. Subsequently, certain results of Gerber and Shiu [H. U. Gerber and E. S. W. Shiu, North American Actuarial Journal 2(1): 48-78 (1998)] can be reproduced. The two-step approach is also applied when an independent Wiener process is added to the surplus process. Certain results are related to Zhang et al. [Z. Zhang, H. Yang, and S. Li, Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 233: 1773-1784 (2010)], which uses different methods.

80053240506	Ruin probabilities for the perturbed compound Poisson risk process with investment	In this article, we consider the perturbed compound Poisson risk process with investment incomes. The risk reserve process is perturbed by an independent Brownian motion and the surplus is invested at a constant force of interest. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the ruin probability as the initial reserve goes to infinity. Bounds and time-dependent bounds are derived for the ultimate ruin probability and the probabilities of ruin within finite time, respectively. We also obtain an explicit expression for the Laplace transform of the ultimate ruin probability. © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We assume that parameters of the Lévy process which models the dynamic of risky asset in the financial market depend on a finite state Markov chain. The state of the Markov chain can be interpreted as the state of the economy. Under the regime switching Lévy model, we obtain the locally risk-minimizing hedging strategies for some unit-linked life insurance products, including both the pure endowment policy and the term insurance contract. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84857038909	Asset allocation under threshold autoregressive models	We discuss the asset allocation problem in the important class of parametric non-linear time series models called the threshold autoregressive model in (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. A 1977; 140:34-35; Patten Recognition and Signal Processing. Sijthoff and Noordhoff: Netherlands, 1978; and J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 1980; 42:245-292). We consider two specific forms, one self-exciting (i.e. the SETAR model) and the other smooth (i.e. the STAR) model developed by Chan and Tong (J. Time Ser. Anal. 1986; 7:179-190). The problem of maximizing the expected utility of wealth over a planning horizon is considered using a discrete-time dynamic programming approach. This optimization approach is flexible enough to deal with the optimal asset allocation problem under a general stochastic dynamical system, which includes the SETAR model and the STAR model as particular cases. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the practical implementation of the proposed model. We also investigate the impacts of non-linearity in the SETAR and STAR models on the optimal portfolio strategies. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84859339556	Valuing equity-linked death benefits and other contingent options: A discounted density approach	Motivated by the Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits in various deferred annuities, we investigate the calculation of the expected discounted value of a payment at the time of death. The payment depends on the price of a stock at that time and possibly also on the history of the stock price. If the payment turns out to be the payoff of an option, we call the contract for the payment a (life) contingent option. Because each time-until-death distribution can be approximated by a combination of exponential distributions, the analysis is made for the case where the time until death is exponentially distributed, i.e., under the assumption of a constant force of mortality. The time-until-death random variable is assumed to be independent of the stock price process which is a geometric Brownian motion. Our key tool is a discounted joint density function. A substantial series of closed-form formulas is obtained, for the contingent call and put options, for lookback options, for barrier options, for dynamic fund protection, and for dynamic withdrawal benefits. In a section on several stocks, the method of Esscher transforms proves to be useful for finding among others an explicit result for valuing contingent Margrabe options or exchange options. For the case where the contracts have a finite expiry date, closed-form formulas are found for the contingent call and put options. From these, results for De Moivre's law are obtained as limits. We also discuss equity-linked death benefit reserves and investment strategies for maintaining such reserves. The elasticity of the reserve with respect to the stock price plays an important role. Whereas in the most important applications the stopping time is the time of death, it could be different in other applications, for example, the time of the next catastrophe. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84860120722	Optimal surrender strategies for equity-indexed annuity investors with partial information	In this paper we consider an equity-indexed annuity (EIA) investor who wants to determine when he should surrender the EIA in order to maximize his logarithmic utility of the wealth at surrender time. We model the dynamics of the index using a geometric Brownian motion with regime switching. To be more realistic, we consider a finite time horizon and assume that the Markov chain is unobservable. This leads to the optimal stopping problem with partial information. We give a representation of the value function and an integral equation satisfied by the boundary. In the Bayesian case which is a special case of our model, we obtain analytical results for the value function and the boundary. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84860620223	Optimal Asset Allocation: A Worst Scenario Expectation Approach	Mean-variance criterion has long been the main stream approach in the optimal portfolio theory. The investors try to balance the risk and the return on their portfolio. In this paper, the deviation of the asset return from the investor's expectation in the worst scenario is used as the measure of risk for portfolio selection. One important advantage of this approach is that the investors can base on their own knowledge, information, and preference on various risks, in addition to the asset's volatility, to adjust their exposure to various risks. It also pinpoints one main concern of the investors when they invest, the amount they lose in the worst situation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84862926946	Elasticity approach to asset allocation in discrete time	In this paper, we apply the elasticity approach to optimal asset allocation problems in discrete-time setting. In particular, firstly, for a portfolio optimization problem, which targets to maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth of a portfolio of an option, the underlying stock, and the risk-free bond, the elasticity approach can decompose this problem into a reduced optimization problem, consisting of only the stock and bond, and a pure delta neutral hedging problem. This decomposition provides a discrete-time version of the optimal alternative to the delta hedge, which was initially proposed in continuous time. Moreover, the general principle given by the pure delta neutral strategy is analyzed in our setting. Secondly, the same approach is applied to an optimal investment problem with defaultable securities, and show that this problem is essentially the same as the above mentioned reduced optimization problem. This work can be regarded as an extension of the elasticity approach in Kraft [Mathematical Methods of Operations Research 58(1) (2003), 159-182] to discrete-time models, and it shows that this approach can largely deduce the asset allocation problems in complete market. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors.

To approximate the optimal dividend policies or optimal controls, we use Markov chain approximation techniques to construct a discrete-time controlled Markov chain with two components. Under simple conditions, we prove the convergence of the approximation sequence to the surplus process and the convergence of the approximation to the value function. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the algorithms.

It derives the equity premium and pricing kernel analytically for the stock price process, obtains an equilibrium option pricing formula, and explains some empirical evidence such as the negative variance risk premium, implied volatility smirk, and negative skewness risk premium by comparing the physical and risk-neutral distributions of the log return. Different from most of the current studies in equilibrium pricing under jump diffusion models, this work models the underlying asset price as the exponential of a Lévy process and thus allows nearly an arbitrage distribution of the jump component. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84867902642	On a Sparre Andersen Risk Model with Time-Dependent Claim Sizes and Jump-Diffusion Perturbation	In this paper, we consider a Sparre Andersen risk model where the interclaim time and claim size follow some bivariate distribution. Assuming that the risk model is also perturbed by a jump-diffusion process, we study the Gerber-Shiu functions when ruin is due to a claim or the jump-diffusion process. By using a q-potential measure, we obtain some integral equations for the Gerber-Shiu functions, from which we derive the Laplace transforms and defective renewal equations. When the joint density of the interclaim time and claim size is a finite mixture of bivariate exponentials, we obtain the explicit expressions for the Gerber-Shiu functions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84870231296	Pricing options and equity-indexed annuities in a regime-switching model by trinomial tree method	In this paper we summarize the main idea and results of Yuen and Yang (2009, 2010a, 2010b). The Markov regime-switching model (MRSM) has recently become a popular model. The MRSM allows the parameters of the market model depending on a Markovian process, and the model can reflect the information of the market environment which cannot be modeled solely by linear Gaussian process. The Markovian process can ensure that the parameters change according to the market environment and at the same time preserves the simplicity of the model. It is also consistent with the efficient market hypothesis that all the effects of the information about the stock price would reflect on the stock price. However, when the parameters of the stock price model are not constant but governed by a Markovian process, the pricing of the options becomes complex. We present a fast and simple trinomial tree model to price options in MRSM. In recent years, the pricing of modern insurance products, such as Equity-Indexed annuity (EIA) and variable annuities (VAs), has become a popular topic. These products can be considered investment plans with associated life insurance benefits, a specified benchmark return, a guarantee of an annual minimum rate of return and a specified rule of the distribution of annual excess investment return above the guaranteed return. EIA usually has a long maturity time, hence it is not appropriate to assume that the interest rate and the volatility of the equity index are constants. One way to deal with this problem is to apply the regime switching model. However, the valuation of derivatives in such model is challenging when the number of states are large, especially for the strong path dependent options such as Asian options. Our trinomial tree model provides an efficient way to solve this problem.

84872064231	On the optimal dividend strategy in a regime-switching diffusion model	In this paper we consider the optimal dividend strategy under the diffusion model with regime switching. In contrast to the classical risk theory, the dividends can only be paid at the arrival times of a Poisson process. By solving an auxiliary optimal problem we showthat the optimal strategy is the modulated barrier strategy. The value function can be obtained by iteration or by solving the system of differential equations. We also provide a numerical example to illustrate the effects of the restriction on the timing of the payment of dividends. © Applied Probability Trust 2012.

This model provides a way to describe the effect of regime switching on price dynamics via the self-exciting threshold principle. Its main advantage is to incorporate the regime switching effect without introducing an additional source of uncertainty. A martingale approach is used to discuss the problem. Analytical solutions are derived in some special cases. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the regime-switching effect described by the proposed model.

84878178791	Optimal dividends with debts and nonlinear insurance risk processes	The optimal dividend problem is a classic problem in corporate finance though an early contribution to this problem can be traced back to the seminal work of an actuary, Bruno De Finetti, in the late 1950s. Nowadays, there is a leap of literature on the optimal dividend problem. However, most of the literature focus on linear insurance risk processes which fail to take into account some realistic features such as the nonlinear effect on the insurance risk processes. In this paper, we articulate this problem and consider an optimal dividend problem with nonlinear insurance risk processes attributed to internal competition factors. We also incorporate other important features such as the presence of debts, constraints in regular control variables, fixed transaction costs and proportional taxes. This poses some theoretical challenges as the problem becomes a nonlinear regular-impulse control problem. Under some suitable hypotheses for the value function, we obtain the structure of the value function using its properties, without guessing its structure, which is widely used in the literature. By solving the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, closed-form solutions to the problem are obtained in various cases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84882340113	Cox risk model with variable premium rate and stochastic return on investment	This paper studies the ruin probability for a Cox risk model with intensity depending on premiums and stochastic investment returns, and the model proposed in this paper allows the dependence between premiums and claims. When the surplus is invested in the bond market with constant interest force, coupled integral equations for the Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function (GS function) are derived; together with the initial value and Laplace transformation of the GS function, we provide a numerical procedure for obtaining the GS function. When the surplus can be invested in risky asset driven by a drifted Brownian motion, we focus on finding a minimal upper bound of ruin probability and find that optimal piecewise constant policy yields the minimal upper bound. It turns out that the optimal piecewise constant policy is asymptotically optimal when initial surplus tends to infinity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84882448817	Numerical methods for optimal dividend payment and investment strategies of regime-switching jump diffusion models with capital injections	This work focuses on numerical methods for finding optimal investment, dividend payment, and capital injection policies to maximize the present value of the difference between the cumulative dividend payment and the possible capital injections. The surplus is modeled by a regime-switching jump diffusion process subject to both regular and singular controls. Using the dynamic programming principle, the value function is a solution of the coupled system of nonlinear integro-differential quasi-variational inequalities. In this paper, the state constraint of the impulsive control gives rise to a capital injection region with free boundary, which makes the problem even more difficult to analyze. Together with the regular control and regime-switching, the closed-form solutions are virtually impossible to obtain. We use Markov chain approximation techniques to construct a discrete-time controlled Markov chain to approximate the value function and optimal controls. Convergence of the approximation algorithms is proved. Examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the numerical methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884402153	Valuing equity-linked death benefits in jump diffusion models	The paper is motivated by the valuation problem of guaranteed minimum death benefits in various equity-linked products. At the time of death, a benefit payment is due. It may depend not only on the price of a stock or stock fund at that time, but also on prior prices. The problem is to calculate the expected discounted value of the benefit payment. Because the distribution of the time of death can be approximated by a combination of exponential distributions, it suffices to solve the problem for an exponentially distributed time of death. The stock price process is assumed to be the exponential of a Brownian motion plus an independent compound Poisson process whose upward and downward jumps are modeled by combinations (or mixtures) of exponential distributions. Results for exponential stopping of a Lévy process are used to derive a series of closed-form formulas for call, put, lookback, and barrier options, dynamic fund protection, and dynamic withdrawal benefit with guarantee. We also discuss how barrier options can be used to model lapses and surrenders. © 2013.

84885623987	Portfolio optimization in a regime-switching market with derivatives	We consider the optimal asset allocation problem in a continuous-time regime-switching market. The problem is to maximize the expected utility of the terminal wealth of a portfolio that contains an option, an underlying stock and a risk-free bond. The difficulty that arises in our setting is finding a way to represent the return of the option by the returns of the stock and the risk-free bond in an incomplete regime-switching market. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a functional operator to generate a sequence of value functions, and then show that the optimal value function is the limit of this sequence. The explicit form of each function in the sequence can be obtained by solving an auxiliary portfolio optimization problem in a single-regime market. And then the original optimal value function can be approximated by taking the limit. Additionally, we can also show that the optimal value function is a solution to a dynamic programming equation, which leads to the explicit forms for the optimal value function and the optimal portfolio process. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, as long as the current state of the Markov chain is given, it is still optimal for an investor in a multiple-regime market to simply allocate his/her wealth in the same way as in a single-regime market. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

0041841494	Some results on ruin probabilities in a two-dimensional risk model	Ruin theory under multi-dimensional risk models is very complex. Even in the two-dimensional case, the problem is challenging. In this paper, we consider a bivariate risk model. Three different types of ruin probabilities are defined. Using some results of one-dimensional risk processes, simple bounds for the two-dimensional ruin probabilities are obtained. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are given to illustrate the tightness of the bounds. A partial integral-differential equation satisfied by the two-dimensional ruin probabilities is derived. Although special cases and examples in this paper provide some exciting results, the problem of ruin probability in a multi-dimensional risk model is still far from solved. We hope that this paper stimulates more research by actuaries in this area. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84891901564	On the decomposition of the absolute ruin probability in a perturbed compound Poisson surplus process with debit interest	We consider a compound Poisson surplus process perturbed by diffusion with debit interest. When the surplus is below zero or the company is on deficit, the company is allowed to borrow money at a debit interest rate to continue its business as long as its debt is at a reasonable level. When the surplus of a company is below a certain critical level, the company is no longer profitable, we say that absolute ruin occurs at this situation. In this risk model, absolute ruin may be caused by a claim or by oscillation. Thus, the absolute ruin probability in the model is decomposed as the sum of two absolute ruin probabilities, where one is the probability that absolute ruin is caused by a claim and the other is the probability that absolute ruin is caused by oscillation. In this paper, we first give the integro-differential equations satisfied by the absolute ruin probabilities and then derive the defective renewal equations for the absolute ruin probabilities. Using these defective renewal equations, we derive the asymptotical forms of the absolute ruin probabilities when the distributions of claim sizes are heavy-tailed and light-tailed. Finally, we derive explicit expressions for the absolute ruin probabilities when claim sizes are exponentially distributed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84905276780	A class of non-zero-sum stochastic differential investment and reinsurance games	In this article, we provide a systematic study on the non-zero-sum stochastic differential investment and reinsurance game between two insurance companies. Each insurance company's surplus process consists of a proportional reinsurance protection and an investment in risky and risk-free assets. Each insurance company is assumed to maximize his utility of the difference between his terminal surplus and that of his competitor. The surplus process of each insurance company is modeled by a mixed regime-switching Cramer-Lundberg diffusion approximation process, i.e. the coefficients of the diffusion risk processes are modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain and an independent market-index process. Correlation between the two surplus processes, independent of the risky asset process, is allowed. Despite the complex structure, we manage to solve the resulting non-zero sum game problem by applying the dynamic programming principle. The Nash equilibrium, the optimal reinsurance/investment, and the resulting value processes of the insurance companies are obtained in closed forms, together with sound economic interpretations, for the case of an exponential utility function.

It is well known that the default risks of different instruments are dependent on each other.

Two different models are proposed to model the default mechanism: the Threshold Model and the Independence Model.

10144255101	On the distribution of surplus immediately after ruin under interest force and subexponential claims	The compound Poisson risk process with a constant interest force is an interesting stochastic model in risk theory. It provides a basic understanding about how investments will affect the ruin probability and related ruin functions. This paper considers the compound Poisson risk model with a constant interest force for an insurance portfolio and studies the distribution of the surplus immediately after ruin under the model. By using the techniques of Kalashnikov and Konstantinides [Kalashnikov, V., Konstantinides, D., 2000. Ruin under interest force and subexponential claims: a simple treatment. Insurance Math. Econ. 27, 145-149] and a formula obtained by Yang and Zhang [Yang, H.L., Zhang, L.H., 2001a. On the distribution of surplus immediately after ruin under interest force. Insurance Math. Econ. 29, 247-255], we give asymptotic formulas of the low and upper bounds for the distribution of the surplus immediately after ruin under subexponential claims. To some extent, we can view our work here as the continuation of the recent important work of Kalashnikov and Konstantinides [Kalashnikov, V., Konstantinides, D., 2000. Ruin under interest force and subexponential claims: a simple treatment. Insurance Math. Econ. 27, 145-149], Yang and Zhang [Yang, H.L., Zhang, L.H., 2001a.
