18344369055	Sorption enhancement of aromatic sulfonates onto an animated hyper-cross-linked polymer	A macroreticular resin adsorbent CHA-101 was aminated by dimethylamine, and a novel sorbent named M-101 was obtained. Several industrially important aromatic sulfonates including sodium benzenesulfonate (BS), sodium p-toluenesulfonate (TS), and sodium 2-naphthalenesulfonate (NS) were selected as general solutes to evaluate the performance of the newly synthesized resin particles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) analyses was used to determine the protonation degree of amino group at different solution pH, and the effect of pH on the sorption of these solutes onto M-101 can be explained by the ion exchange mechanism. The experimentally observed sequence of the sorption capacity of the tested organic sulfonates onto M-101 indicates that the π-π interaction between the solute molecule and the polymer matrix plays an important role in uptake of organic sulfonates from aqueous solution. Sodium sulfate was selected as a typical competitive inorganic anion, and improved selectivity of BS sorption over sulfate on M-101 was observed by comparison with a common macroporous weak base anion exchanger D-301. In addition, both sorption and desorption kinetics of M-101 were also found to be faster than that of D-301. Analyses of sorption isotherms and thermodynamics proved that BS sorption on M-101 was an exothermic and more selective process than on D-301. Both column tests and field applications proved M-101 to be an effective sorbent that can be used to remove aromatic sulfonates from aqueous solution. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

18544366597	Adsorption of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution onto a macroporous polymer and its aminated derivative: Isotherm analysis	Adsorption of phenolic compounds from aqueous solution to a macroporous polymeric adsorbent (CHA-111), its animated derivative (MCH-111) and a reference weakly anion exchanger (ND-900) was studied. Experimental results indicated that amino functional groups on the polymeric matrix play an important role in phenol adsorption by MCH-111 and ND-900, which was attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the phenol molecule and the amino group on the polymeric matrix. The semi-empirical Freundlich isotherm equation and its reduced form were employed to interpret the adsorption behavior. A site energy distribution model based on the Polanyi adsorption potential theory can elucidate the adsorption mechanism reasonably. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

20544456018	Study of sorption mechanism of o-chlorophenol and p-chlorophenol onto D301	In the present study X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was adopted to elucidate sorption mechanism of o-chlorophenol and p-chlorophenol onto a weak anion exchanger D301. The distribution of specific forms of amino groups on D301 was obtained and effect of free tertiary amine group on phenol sorption onto D301 was discussed. The result indicate that less free amino group on D301 caused by external solution with lower pH leads to less sorptive capacity of o-chlorophenol and p-chlorophenol respectively. Under the experimental conditions sorption of chlorophenols onto D301 can be explained by solid extraction mechanism and the coefficient of distribution has a linear relationship with the content of free amino group on D301.

23344432104	Application of an effective method in predicting breakthrough curves of fixed-bed adsorption onto resin adsorbent	Removal of many organic pollutants including phenolic compounds from industrial wastewater can always be achieved by fixed-bed adsorption onto the polymeric resin adsorbent, and the relevant breakthrough curves would provide much valuable information to help to design a fixed-bed adsorption process in field application. In the present study, a model developed based on the constant-pattern wave approach theory and the Freundlich model was adopted to describe the breakthrough curves of phenol and p-nitrophenol adsorption onto a macroreticular resin adsorbent NDA-100 from aqueous solution. Column experiments were performed at different conditions to verify the model and the results proved that the model would describe the breakthrough curves well. Effect of the operation parameters on breakthrough curves was also discussed to get helpful information in choosing the adsorption process. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

30744450272	Competitive and cooperative adsorption behaviors of phenol and aniline onto nonpolar macroreticular adsorbents	The adsorption behaviors of phenol and aniline on nonpolar macroreticular adsorbents (NDA100 and Amberlite XAD4) were investigated in single or binary batch system at 293K and 313K respectively in this study. The results indicated that the adsorption isotherms of phenol and aniline on both adsorbents in both systems fitted well Langmuir equation, which indicated a favourable and exothermic process. At the lower equilibrium concentrations, the individual amount adsorbed of phenol or aniline or macroreticular adsorbents in single-component systems was higher than those in binary-component systems because of the competition between phenol and aniline towards the adsorption sites. It is noteworthy, on the contrast, that at higher concentrations, the total uptake amounts of phenol and aniline in binary-component systems were obviously larger than that in single-component systems, and a large excess was noted on the adsorbent surface at saturation, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect primarily arisen from the hydrogen bonding or weak acidbase interaction between phenol and aniline. © 2005 Science Press.

30744457857	Effects of the surface chemistry of macroreticular adsorbents on the adsorption of 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine mixtures from water	The adsorption behaviors of 1-naphthol, 1-naphthylamine and 1-naphthol/ 1-naphthylamine mixtures in water over two macroreticular adsorbents were investigated in single or binary batch systems at 293 K, 303 K and 313 K respectively. All the adsorption isotherms in the studied systems can be adequately fitted by Langmuir model. In the case of aminated macroreticular adsorbent NDA103, 1-naphthol is adsorbed to a larger extent than 1-naphthylamine; while, the opposite trend is found for nonpolar macroreticular adsorbent NDA100. It is noteworthy that at higher temperature (303 K and 313 K), the total uptake amounts of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in all binary-component systems are obvious larger than the pure uptake amounts in single-component systems, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect primarily arisen from the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the loaded 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine molecules. The simultaneous adsorption systems were confirmed to be helpful to the selective adsorption towards 1-naphthol according to the larger selective index. © 2005 Science Press. All rights reserved.

It is noteworthy that the experimental uptakes of adsorbates in the test binary-component systems are obviously larger than the corresponding ones predicted from Extended Langmuir model postulating no lateral interaction between the loaded molecules, which is assumably due to the cooperative effect mainly arisen from the acid-base interaction between the loaded aromatic acid (phenol, NSA) and aromatic base (aniline) molecules. The newly modified model, with single-component adsorption isotherm parameters and binary-component fitting parameters, generally showed a marked improvement in the correlation of binary adsorption equilibrium compared to the Extended Langmuir model, which used only single-component isotherm parameters.

33646094933	Cooperative adsorption behaviours of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine onto nonpolar macroreticular adsorbents	In this study, the adsorption behaviours of 1-naphthol, 1-naphthylamine and 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine mixtures in aqueous solutions on nonpolar macroreticular adsorbents (NDA100 and Amberlite XAD4) were investigated in single or binary batch system at 293, 303 and 313 K, respectively. The results showed that all the adsorption isotherms of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine on both adsorbents in both systems can be well fitted by Langmuir equation, and 1-naphthylamine is adsorbed to a larger extent than 1-naphthol on both adsorbents because of its greater electronic density of the aromatic ring of 1-naphthylamine. Owing to the greater surface area and micropores, NDA100 displays much higher adsorption capacity toward both adsorbates than XAD4. It is noteworthy that at higher equilibrium concentrations, the total uptake amounts of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in all binary-component systems are remarkably higher than that in single-component systems. The excess was observed on the adsorbent surface at saturation, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect arisen from the hydrogen bonding or weak acid-base interaction between 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine. The cooperative coefficients of them on XAD4 are notably larger than those on NDA100 for the more appropriate pore size of XAD4. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that at the higher equilibrium concentrations, the total uptake amounts of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in binary systems (1-naphthol-l-naphthylamine = 3:1, 1:1, 1:3) are obvious larger than the pure uptake amounts in single systems, and a large excess was noted on the particle surface at saturation, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect primarily arisen from the hydrogen bonding or weak acid-base interaction between 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine. The adsorption isotherms for them in both single and binary systems can be well fitted by Langmuir equation. The increasing temperature from 293K to 313K puts much more effect on the cooperative coefficient of simultaneous adsorption of 1-naphthylamine and 1-naphthol on NDA103 than on NDA100. The amino groups on NDA103 enhance the adsorption affinity as well as the cooperative coefficient of 1-naphthol.

The results indicated that adsorption isotherms for them in both single and binary systems can be well fitted by the Langmuir equation. At the lower equilibrium concentrations, the individual adsorbed amounts of phenol or aniline on macroreticular adsorbents in single systems is higher than those in binary systems because of the competition between phenol and aniline towards the adsorption sites. It is noteworthy that at higher concentrations, the total uptake amounts of phenol and aniline in binary systems are obviously larger than the pure uptake amounts in single systems, and a large excess was noted on the particle surface at saturation, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect primarily arisen from the hydrogen bonding or weak acid-base interaction between phenol and aniline. Increasing temperature from 293 K to 313 K enhanced the cooperative effect on simultaneous adsorption of aniline and phenol on NDA103; while, the cooperative coefficients on NDA101 and NDA100 almost kept unchanged.

33746321539	Competitive and cooperative adsorption of aromatic acids and bases onto a new aminated macroreticular adsorbent	The adsorption behaviour of three aromatic acids [phenol, benzoic acid (BCA) and 2-naphthalene sulphonic acid (2-NSA)] and of one aromatic base (aniline) on an aminated macroreticular adsorbent (NDA103) were investigated employing single or binary batch systems at 293 K and 313 K, respectively. All the adsorption isotherms in the studied systems could be adequately fitted by the Langmuir model, thereby indicating the existence of an exothermic adsorption process for phenol, BCA and aniline. At low equilibrium concentrations, the individual uptakes in the shigle-component systems were higher than those in binary-component systems because of competition between the two types of adsorbate molecules towards the adsorption sites. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the total molar uptakes of adsorbates in the binary-component systems at high equilibrium concentrations were larger than the uptakes in the single-component systems. In binary-component systems, a large excess of aromatic acids was noted on the adsorbent surface at saturation, presumably as a result of a cooperative effect arising primarily from acid-base interaction between the loaded adsorbates. © 2006 Ingenta.

33748428498	Preparation of an aminated macroreticular resin adsorbent and its adsorption of p-nitrophenol from water	A chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer was post-cross-linked through Friedel-Crafts reaction to get a macroreticular resin adsorbent NA-01, and then chemically modified by dimethylamine to obtain an aminated adsorbent NA-01A. Batch adsorption runs of p-nitrophenol from aqueous solution onto adsorbent NA-01A were conducted to evaluate the effect of amino group on adsorption. The adsorption capacity of p-nitrophenol on NA-01A increased noticeably by comparison with the mother adsorbent. A linear relationship was observed between the adsorption capacity of NA-01A caused by amination and the equilibrium concentration of p-nitrophenol in aqueous solution, which can be reasonably elucidated by a modified isotherm equation based on the Freundlich model. The breakthrough curves on both adsorbents were experimentally determined and also predicted by the mathematic model based on the non-linear wave propagation theory and the corresponding isotherm model. The model based on the Freundlich model gave a good prediction of the breakthrough curve on NA-01, but a deviation occurred for NA-01A when C/C

33845579691	Adsorption of laterally interacting 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine mixtures on nonpolar surfaces from aqueous solutions	The binary adsorption behavior of 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine mixtures in water on nonpolar adsorbent Amberlite XAD4 was investigated at 293 K, 303 K and 313 K, respectively. The experimental uptakes of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in all binary-component systems of different molar ratios were obviously higher than the corresponding uptakes predicted by the extended Langmuir model, assuming no interaction between the adsorbed molecules of the two components. This phenomenon was attributed to the cooperative adsorption effect arising from the hydrogen bonding interaction between 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine molecules. A modified extended Langmuir model was proposed to describe the binary adsorption behavior by means of introducing a fitting parameter related with the cooperative adsorption effect of the adsorbates. © 2006 World-Scientific.

33845592305	Synergistic interactions on phenol adsorption from aqueous solutions by polymeric adsorbents	In this paper, the adsorption behaviors of phenol on polymeric adsorbents (Amberlite XAD4, NDA101, and D301) were investigated in batch system at 293, 303, and 313 K, respectively. As the results shown, the adsorption isotherms of phenol on all adsorbents can be well fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich equations, which indicate a favorable and exothermic process. The adsorption capacity on a newly developed aminated adsorbent, NDA101, on which adsorption could be achieved by both hydrogen bonding interaction and π-π interaction, are higher than that on a weak base adsorbent, D301, on which adsorption could be achieved by hydrogen bonding interaction only, and on a nonpolar adsorbent, XAD4, on which adsorption could be achieved by π-π interaction only. The results of this paper indicate that the synergistic effect of some weak interactions, which occur simultaneously would contribute more to the adsorption than that occur individually. ©2005 World-Scientific.

33845596700	Effect of weak interactions on phenol adsorption from aqueous solutions by aminated polymeric adsorbents	Adsorption behaviors of phenol from aqueous solutions have been investigated in batch systems at 303 K and 318 K respectively, using hypercrosslinked polymeric adsorbent (CHA111), aminated hypercrosslinked polymeric adsorbents (NDA101, NDA103, NDA105) and weakly basic polymeric adsorbent (D301) with a view to studying the effect of hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions between adsorbate and the adsorbent. All adsorption isotherms can be well fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich equations. Compared with D301 driven by hydrogen bonding interaction only and CHA111 driven by Van der Waals interaction only, phenol adsorption on aminated adsorbents driven by both hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions were apparently different, i.e., negative effect for NDA105, positive effect for NDA101 and synergistic effect for NDA103. In this synergistic action, some weak interactions would contribute more or less to the adsorption than they work individually. © 2006 World-Scientific.

33845625727	Modeling synergistic adsorption of phenol/aniline mixtures in the aqueous phase onto porous polymer adsorbents	The adsorption equilibria of phenol and aniline on nonpolar polymer adsorbents (NDA-100, XAD-4, NDA-16 and NDA-1800) were investigated in single- and binary-solute adsorption systems at 313 K. The results showed that all the adsorption isotherms of phenol and aniline on these adsorbents can be well fitted by Freundlich and Langmuir equations, and the experimental uptake of phenol and aniline in all binary-component systems is obviously higher than predicted by the extended Langmuir model, arising presumably from the synergistic effect caused by the laterally acid-base interaction between the adsorbed phenol and aniline molecules. A new model (MELM) was developed to quantitatively describe the synergistic adsorption behavior of phenol/aniline equimolar mixtures in the binary-solute systems and showed a marked improvement in correlating the binary-solute adsorption of phenol and aniline by comparison with the widely used extended Langmuir model. The newly developed model confirms that the synergistic coefficient of one adsorbate is linearly correlated with the adsorbed amount of the other, and the larger average pore size of adsorbent results in the greater synergistic effect of phenol/aniline equimolar mixtures adsorption. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33846065539	Adsorption enhancement of laterally interacting phenol/aniline mixtures onto nonpolar adsorbents	Adsorption equilibria of phenol and aniline onto nonpolar macroreticular adsorbents were investigated in single and binary-solute aqueous systems at 293 K and 313 K. All adsorption isotherms can be well represented by the Langmuir equation. Larger uptake of aniline than phenol onto all the adsorbents probably results from the higher hydrophobicity of the former compound as well as the greater electronic density of the aromatic ring of aniline. It is interestingly observed that at a relatively high loading, the total uptake of phenol and aniline in a binary system is remarkably higher than those in a single system. Such uptake difference was elucidated by the cooperative effect arising from the lateral acid-base interaction between the loaded phenol and aniline molecules. Moreover, larger average pore size of the adsorbent is found to result in a greater cooperative coefficient, as observed from the equimolar phenol/aniline adsorption system. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental results indicated that NaCl in solution takes a negligible effect on p-nitroanilien adsorption. NDA-99 and NDA-150 exhibited a maximum capacity at neutral solution pH, while the capacity of XAD-4 was increased as solution pH increased. All the adsorption isotherms can be well represented by Freundlich equation. Adsorption capacity of the adsorbents follows the sequence as NDA-150 > NDA-99 > XAD-4. Subsequently, NDA-150 was employed for treatment of p-nitroaniline manufacturing wastewater. P-nitroaniline concentration in the wastewater was decreased from 1450mg / L to 43.5mg / L after NDA-150 adsorption with the corresponding removal efficiency of about 97%. The spent NDA-150 could be readily regenerated with 95% ethanol for repeated use. p-nitroaniline would be subsequently recovered from the high concentrated regenerant solution by distillation.

34147155920	Highly effective removal of heavy metals by polymer-based zirconium phosphate: A case study of lead ion	Zirconium phosphate (ZrP) has recently been demonstrated as an excellent sorbent for heavy metals due to its high selectivity, high thermal stability, and absolute insolubility in water. However, it cannot be readily adopted in fixed beds or any other flowthrough system due to the excessive pressure drop and poor mechanical strength resulting from its fine submicrometer particle sizes. In the present study a hybrid sorbent, i.e., polymer-supported ZrP, was prepared by dispersing ZrP within a strongly acidic cation exchanger D-001 and used for enhanced lead removal from contaminated waters. D-001 was selected as a host material for sorbent preparation mainly because of the Donnan membrane effect resulting from the nondiffusible negatively charged sulfonic acid group on the exchanger surface, which would enhance permeation of the targeted metal ions. The hybrid sorbent (hereafter denoted ZrP-001) was characterized using a nitrogen adsorption technique, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Lead sorption onto ZrP-001 was found to be pH dependent due to the ion-exchange mechanism, and its sorption kinetics onto ZrP-001 followed the pseudo-first-order model. Compared to D-001, ZrP-001 exhibited more favorable lead sorption particularly in terms of high selectivity, as indicated by its substantially larger distribution coefficients when other competing cations Na

34147181197	Enhanced removal of p-chloroaniline from aqueous solution by a carboxylated polymeric sorbent	In the present study a carboxylated styrene-divinylbenzene (St-DVB) polymeric sorbent (CSPS) was prepared for enhanced removal of p-chloroaniline from aqueous solution. A commercial styrene-divinylbenzene polymeric sorbent Amberlite XAD-4 was selected as the reference sorbent to evaluate the performance of CSPS. Characterization of CSPS was determined by infrared spectroscopy and pore size distribution. A p-chloroaniline sorption enhancement on CSPS at capacity about twice of Amberlite XAD-4 was observed, which was mainly attributed to the carboxyl group added on the polymeric matrix. Different pH-dependent sorption property of p-chloroaniline onto XAD-4 and CSPS was observed partly due to the role of carboxyl group. Sorption isotherm of p-chloroaniline on CSPS could be represented by Freundlich model reasonably, and that on XAD-4 was more suitable for Langmuir model. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the uptake of p-chloroaniline on CSPS and XAD-4 followed the pseudo-second order model. Moreover, breakthrough curves on CSPS further demonstrated its better performance towards p-chloroaniline removal from aqueous solution. Complete regeneration of the spent sorbent CSPS was achieved by dilute hydrochloric acid for its repeated use, implying its potential application in associated chemical wastewater treatments. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

34248340941	Assessment on the removal of dimethyl phthalate from aqueous phase using a hydrophilic hyper-cross-linked polymer resin NDA-702	A hydrophilic hyper-cross-linked polymer resin (NDA-702) was synthesized, and the adsorption performance of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) on NDA-702 was compared with that on the commercial hydrophobic macroporous resin (Amberlite XAD-4) and granular activated carbon (AC-750). The kinetic adsorption of DMP onto NDA-702 and AC-750 is limited mainly by intraparticle diffusion and obeys the pseudo-second-order rate model, while the uptake on XAD-4 is limited mainly by film diffusion and follows the pseudo-first-order rate model. All the associated adsorption isotherms are well described by the Freundlich equation, and the larger uptake and stronger affinity of NDA-702 than AC-750 and XAD-4 probably result from the microporous structure, phenyl rings, and polar groups on NDA-702 polymer matrix. An interesting observation is that in the aqueous phase all the adsorbents spontaneously adsorb DMP driven mainly by enthalpy change, but the hydrophilic nature of NDA-702 and AC-750 surfaces results in less entropy change compared to hydrophobic XAD-4. Dynamic adsorption studies show that the high breakthrough and the total adsorption capacities of NDA-702 are 388 and 559 mg per gram dry resin at 313 K. Nearly 100% regeneration efficiency for the resin was achieved by methanol at 313 K. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34547228197	Improved adsorption of 4-nitrophenol onto a novel hyper-cross-linked polymer	In the present study we prepared a hyper-cross-linked polymeric adsorbent (NDA-701) possessing a uniquely bimodal pore size distribution for 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) adsorption from water. A macroporous polymeric adsorbent Amberlite XAD-4 and a granular activated carbon GAC-1 were chosen for comparison. NDA-701 exhibited better mechanical strength and higher capacity of 4-NP than XAD-4, which possibly resulted from its hyper-cross-linking nature and micropore structure, respectively. 4-NP adsorption isotherm onto NDA-701 is well described by the Freundlich model, and its better kinetics performance than GAC-1 resulted from its macropore structure After adsorption NDA-701 was amenable to an entire regeneration by using NaOH solution as regenerant, whereas only ∼75% regeneration efficiency was observed for GAC-1. Results of continuous fixed-bed runs in pilot and industrial scale demonstrated that NDA-701 is capable of completely removing 4-NP from chemical effluent with no capacity loss, and 4-NP can be readily recovered by further treatment of the concentrated regenerant solution. It is attractive that the value of the recovered 4-NP from chemical wastewater will even engender a surplus after countervailing all the operation cost during field application. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

34548672593	Enhanced adsorption of p-nitroaniline from water by a carboxylated polymeric adsorbent	In the present study a carboxylated polymeric adsorbent ZK-1 was synthesized for enhanced removal of p-nitroaniline (PNA) from aqueous solution. A commercial polymeric adsorbent XAD-4 was selected for comparison purpose. Characterization of ZK-1 was characterized by infrared spectroscopy and pore size distribution analysis. Experimental results showed that PNA adsorption onto ZK-1 was greatly enhanced due to its micropore structure and the carboxylic group introduced onto polymeric matrix. Different pH-dependent adsorption tendency of PNA onto XAD-4 and ZK-1 was observed mainly due to the role of carboxyl group on the ZK-1 surface. Isotherms of PNA adsorption onto ZK-1 and XAD-4 could be represented by Langmuir model reasonably. More favorable PNA adsorption onto ZK-1 than XAD-4 was further demonstrated by thermodynamic ananlysis. Kinetic studies demonstrated that PNA uptake onto ZK-1 followed the pseudo-second order model, while that onto XAD-4 would be more suitably represented by the pseudo-first order model. Column adsorption runs indicated that PNA could be completely removed from aqueous system by ZK-1. Moreover, efficient regeneration of the spent adsorbent ZK-1 was readily achieved by ethanol and water for its repeated use. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

And a coal-based granular activated carbon (AC-750) was chosen for comparison. All the adsorption equilibrium data of DMP were well fitted by the Polanyi-based isotherm modeling (Polanyi-Manes (PM) equation), and the characteristic curves of the three adsorbents were obtained. It is noteworthy that a reasonably good agreement was obtained between the combined micropore and mesopore volume of adsorbents and the corresponding adsorption volume capacity for phthalates. Compared to the granular activated carbon (AC-750), the greater adsorption performances of the two resins (NDA-99 and NDA-150) were assumed to result from their more abundant micro- and mesopore structure, where phthalates can be intensively adsorbed by pore-filling mechanism. According to the exponent b value of the PM equation, NDA-99 and NDA-150 show the more micro- and mesopore heterogeneity than AC-750. On the other hand, the functional groups on the adsorbent surfaces did not take a notable effect on the adsorption equilibria of phthalates. The theory equilibrium adsorption amounts of DEP, predicted by the specific characteristic curve of each adsorbent, agree well with the experimental ones, respectively. The characteristic curve of hyper-cross-linked polymer resins and its prediction of phthalates adsorption calculated by Polanyi-based isotherm modeling have a potential applicability for field applications. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While NaCl existed in the solution, equilibrium adsorption data fitted Freundlich isotherms in the studied concentration range, as well as NaCl was inexistent.

33645019267	Binary competitive and cooperative adsorption of aromatic compounds on polymeric resins	The adsorption behaviors of 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid and aniline on a conventional macroporous resin Amberlite XAD4 and the other two newly-developed hypercrosslinked resins NDA101 and NDA100 were investigated in a single or binary batch system at 293 K and 313 K, respectively. All the adsorption isotherms of 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid and aniline on the test resins in both systems can fit well with the Langmuir equation, indicating that the adsorption is a favorable process. At the identical equilibrium concentration, the amount of aniline adsorbed on polymeric resins in the single system is higher than that in the binary system because of the competitive adsorption between 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid and aniline on the resin surface. However, the uptake amount of 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid in the binary system is markedly larger than that in the single system, which is presumably due to the cooperative effect arisen from the electrostatic interaction between 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid and aniline adsorbed on the resin surface. The simultaneous adsorption system was proven to be helpful for the selective adsorption toward 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid due to its larger selective index. © 2005 World-Scientific.

The experimental uptakes of phenol and aniline in all binary-component systems are obviously higher than predicted by Extended Langmuir model, arising presumably from the synergistic effect caused by the hydrogen bonding interaction between the loaded phenol and aniline molecules.

34247469797	Cooperative effect of lateral acid-base interaction on 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine binary adsorption onto nonpolar polymer adsorbents	Adsorption equilibria of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine were investigated in single-solute and binary-solute (primary-co-solute and equimolar solute experiments) adsorption systems at 293 K. Two commercial nonpolar polystyrene adsorbents (NDA-16 and NDA-1800) were employed here for their frequent use in organic pollutants removal from contaminated waters. All the adsorption isotherms of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in single-solute and equimolar binary-solute adsorption systems were found to be well fitted by Langmuir equation. Adsorption uptake of the primary solute was enhanced in the presence of the co-solute, arising presumably from the cooperative effect caused by the laterally attractive acid-base interaction between the adsorbed 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine molecules. Due to the stronger adsorption affinity of 1-naphthylamine to nonpolar adsorbents, adsorption enhancement of 1-naphthylamine in the presence of 1-naphthol is greater than that of 1-naphthol in the presence of 1-naphthylamine. A model (modified extended Langmuir model, MLM) is proved to well describe the cooperative adsorption of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in the equimolar binary-solute system. The cooperative coefficient of one adsorbate is linearly correlated with the amount of the other adsorbed on the adsorbent. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84861458781	Simple fabrication of polymer-based Trametes versicolor laccase for decolorization of malachite green	A highly efficient and stable biocatalyst (denoted D201_Lac) was fabricated by encapsulating . Trametes versicolor laccase within a macroporous and strongly basic exchange resin D201 through a simple adsorption process. Transmission electron micrographs and Fourier transform infrared spectra of the resultant D201_Lac proved that nanosized laccase clusters were embedded into the inner nano-pores/channels of D201. As compared to the free laccase, D201_Lac showed enhanced resistance in the pH range of 3-7 or at temperature of 30-60. °C. Besides, negligible laccase was leached out from the host polymer D201 in solution of pH 3-7 and NaCl concentration up to 0.5. M, which might be attributed to the electrostatic attraction and the possible twining between long-chain laccase and the cross-linking host resin. Continuous seven-cycle batch decoloration of malachite green demonstrates that decoloration efficiency of D201_Lac kept constant for more than 320-h operation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84861740897	Effect of effluent organic matter on the adsorption of perfluorinated compounds onto activated carbon	Effect of effluent organic matter (EfOM) on the adsorption of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) onto powdered activated carbon (PAC) was quantitatively investigated at environmentally relevant concentration levels. The adsorption of both perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) onto PAC followed pseudo-second order kinetics and fitted the Freundlich model well under the given conditions. Intraparticle diffusion was found to be the rate-controlling step in the PFC adsorption process onto PAC in the absence and presence of EfOM. The presence of EfOM, either in PFC-EfOM simultaneous adsorption onto fresh PAC or in PFC adsorption onto EfOM-preloaded PAC, significantly reduced the adsorption capacities and sorption rates of PFCs. The pH of zero point of charge was found to be 7.5 for fresh PAC and 4.2 for EfOM-preloaded PAC, suggesting that the adsorbed EfOM imparted a negative charge on PAC surface. The effect of molecular weight distribution of EfOM on the adsorption of PFCs was investigated with two EfOM fractions obtained by ultrafiltration. The low-molecular-weight compounds (<1. kDa) were found to be the major contributors to the significant reduction in PFC adsorption capacity, while large-molecular-weight compounds (>30. kDa) had much less effect on PFC adsorption capacity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84897942252	Acid and organic resistant nano-hydrated zirconium oxide (HZO)/polystyrene hybrid adsorbent for arsenic removal from water	Hydrous zirconium oxide (HZO)-originated nanocomposite adsorbent of excellent stability against pH variation and organic ligands was fabricated for efficient arsenic removal from water. The nanocomposite adsorbent HZO-201 was obtained by encapsulating nanosized HZO particles inside a polystyrene anion exchanger D201. Negligible metal dissolution was observed from HZO-201 in solution of acidic pHs (to ~1) and oxalate at high levels, while significant metal leaching occurred from a similar hydrated ferric oxide-based nanocomposite HFO-201of the same host. Arsenate adsorption by HZO-201 is a pH-dependent process with maximum capacity of 88.74. mg/g at pH 7.0 ± 0.1, comparable to HFO-201 under similar conditions. As compared to sulfate, chloride, and bicarbonate, silicate and phosphate could inhibit arsenic uptake more strongly by HZO-201. Fixed-bed adsorption indicated that arsenate in simulated groundwater could be effectively captured from 100. μg/L to <10. μg/L within 2600. BV (bed volume), and that in a real acidic mining effluent could be removed from 750. μg/L to <50. μg/L within 2900. BV. The exhausted HZO-201 was also amenable to efficient regeneration with a binary NaCl-NaOH solution for repeated use without any significant capacity loss. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Lead sorption onto both sorbents was found to be pH-dependent due to the ion-exchange mechanism. Sorption isotherms onto both sorbents can be well correlated by Langmuir model.

46449128792	Adsorptive removal of phenol from aqueous phase by using a porous acrylic ester polymer	The removal of phenol from aqueous solution was examined by using a porous acrylic ester polymer (Amberlite XAD-7) as an adsorbent. Favorable phenol adsorption was observed at acidic solution pH and further increase of solution pH results in a marked decrease of adsorption capacity, and the coexisting inorganic salt NaCl exerts positive effect on the adsorption process. Adsorption isotherms of phenol were linearly correlated and found to be well represented by either the Langmuir or Freundlich isotherm model. Thermodynamic parameters such as changes in the enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS) and free energy (ΔG) indicate that phenol adsorption onto XAD-7 is an exothermic and spontaneous process in nature, and lower ambient temperature results in more favorable adsorption. Kinetic experiments at different initial solute concentrations were investigated and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model was successfully represented the kinetic data. Additionally, the column adsorption result showed that a complete removal of phenol from aqueous phase can be achieved by XAD-7 beads and the exhausted adsorbent was amenable to an entire regeneration by using ethanol as the regenerant. More interestingly, relatively more volume of hot water in place of ethanol can also achieve a similar result for repeated use of the adsorbent. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

47749121738	Equilibrium and heat of adsorption of diethyl phthalate on heterogeneous adsorbents	Removal of phthalate esters from water has been of considerable concern recently. In the present study, the adsorptive removal performance of diethyl phthalate (DEP) from water was investigated with the aminated polystyrene resin (NDA-101) and oxidized polystyrene resin (NDA-702). In addition, the commercial homogeneous polystyrene resin (XAD-4) and acrylic ester resin (Amberlite XAD-7) as well as coal-based granular activated carbon (AC-750) were chosen for comparison. The corresponding equilibrium isotherms are well described by the Freundlich equation and the adsorption capacities for DEP followed the order NDA-702 > NDA-101 > AC-750 > XAD-4 > XAD-7. Analysis of adsorption mechanisms suggested that these adsorbents spontaneously adsorb DEP molecules driven mainly by enthalpy change, and the adsorption process was derived by multiple adsorbent-adsorbate interactions such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and micropore filling. The information related to the adsorbent surface heterogeneity and the adsorbate-adsorbate interaction was obtained by Do's model. All the results indicate that heterogeneous resins NDA-702 and NDA-101 have excellent potential as an adsorption material for the removal of DEP from the contaminated water. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, several nanosized hydrated ferric oxide (HFO)-loaded polymer sorbents were prepared and assayed to examine the effect of HFO loadings on arsenate sorption from aqueous solution. Batch and column sorption studies showed that the sorption capacity of arsenate increased with the increase of HFO loadings from 3 to 15% (in Fe mass); however, a further increase in the HFO loadings resulted in a dramatic decrease of the sorption capacity. At relatively low arsenate levels (e.g., < 1 mg/L), sorbents with lower HFO loadings exhibited higher distribution coefficients (K

50549103385	Removal enhancement of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine in single and binary aqueous phase by acid-basic interactions with polymer adsorbents	In the present study removal performance of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine from wastewater by single and binary adsorption was compared. Synergistic effects were investigated in single-solute, binary-solute, and the preloading adsorption systems at 293 K. Two commercial polystyrene adsorbents Amberlite XAD-4, a macroporous adsorbent, and NDA-100, a hyper-cross-linked adsorbent, were employed here for their frequent use in organic pollutants removal from contaminated waters. All the adsorption isotherms of 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine on both adsorbents were found to be well represented by the Langmuir equation. Adsorption capacity of the primary solute was enhanced in the presence of the co-solute, arising presumably from the synergistic effect caused by the laterally acid-base interaction between the adsorbed 1-naphthol and 1-naphthylamine molecules. Due to the stronger adsorption affinity of 1-naphthylamine to nonpolar adsorbents, adsorption enhancement of 1-naphthylamine in the presence of 1-naphthol is greater than that of 1-naphthol in the presence of 1-naphthylamine. The greater synergistic effect of 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine equimolar mixtures on XAD-4 than that on NDA-100 partly results from the larger average pore size of the former adsorbent. A modified extended Langmuir model is proved to well describe the synergistic adsorption of 1-naphthol/1-naphthylamine equimolar mixtures in the binary-solute system. The synergistic coefficient of one adsorbate is linearly correlated with the amount of the other adsorbed on the adsorbent. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

53949099659	Removal of aromatic sulfonates from aqueous media by aminated polymeric sorbents: Concentration-dependent selectivity and the application	Sorption of aromatic sulfonates onto two aminated polystyrene sorbents with different pore structures (M-101 and D-301) was investigated for optimization of their potential application in chemical wastewater treatment. Sodium benzenesulfonate (BS), sodium 2-naphthalene sulfonate (2-NS) and disodium 2,6-naphthalene disulfonate (2,6-NDS) were selected as reference solutes and sodium sulfate was as a competitive inorganic salt. Sorption selectivity of both sorbents is dependent upon the concentration levels of aromatic sulfonates in solution coexisting with sodium sulfate at a high level. However, both sorbents exhibit different characters. D-301 presents more favorable sorption for the solutes at relatively high levels (e.g., higher than 5 mM for BS, 0.7 mM for 2-NS and 0.05 mM for 2,6-NS), while M-101 removes aromatic sulfonates more completely when the solute concentration kept at relatively low levels. Based on the experimental results, we proposed an integral process of sorption onto D-301 followed by secondary-sorption onto M-101 to remove aromatic sulfonates from industrial wastewater completely and economically. Furthermore, the satisfactory performance revealed from large-scale application further demonstrated the feasibility of extending this process to dispose of other associated chemical wastewaters. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

55849095866	Recent patents on polymeric adsorbents and their derivatives for pollutants removal from aqueous media: A mini review	Water pollution by organic and/or inorganic pollutants has gained considerable attention all over the world. In the past decades, adsorption has been proposed as one of the most effective and simplest approaches to remove pollutants from contaminated waters, and polymer-based adsorbents have been widely used as efficient adsorbents except for activated carbon. Here, we reviewed recent patents on preparation of polymeric adsorbents and their derivatives as well as their application in pollutants removal from waters. Here, we classify the polymer-based adsorbents as four types for review: polymeric porous adsorbents; their chemically modified derivatives, polymer-coated inorganic hybrid adsorbents, and polymeric chelating adsorbents. Some of the features on their preparation, properties, and applications were illustrated by case studies.

56249091028	A comparative study of the adsorption properties of 1-naphthylamine by XAD-4 and NDA-150 polymer resins	A hydrophilic polymer resin (NDA-150) was synthesized, and the adsorption performance of 1-naphthylamine on NDA-150 was compared with that on the commercial hydrophobic resin (XAD-4). The kinetic adsorption of 1-naphthylamine onto the two resins is limited by the successive steps of film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion, and obeys the pseudo-second-order rate model. But the adsorption rate on XAD-4 is greater than NDA-150. All the associated adsorption isotherms can be well represented by Langmuir equation, and the larger uptake and stronger affinity of NDA-150 than XAD-4 probably results from the abundant microporous structure and polar groups of NDA-150. It is obviously observed that hydrophobic XAD-4 spontaneously adsorbs 1-naphthylamine driven mainly by enthalpy change, while hydrophilic NDA-150 does driven mainly by both entropy change and enthalpy change. Dynamic breakthrough and the total adsorption capacity of NDA-150 at 293 K are 1.49 and 1.82 mmol mL

The sorption performance of 1-naphthol on NDA-150 was explored and compared with that on the commercial hydrophobic resin XAD-4. The sorption rates of 1-naphthol onto both of the two resins obey the pseudo-second-order kinetics, and are limited by the successive steps of film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. The greater sorption rate on XAD-4 than NDA-150 is probably due to the larger average pore diameter of XAD-4. All the adsorption isotherms can be represented by Langmuir equation. The larger capacity and stronger affinity of NDA-150 than XAD-4 probably result from the abundant microporous structure and polar groups of NDA-150. In aqueous phase hydrophobic XAD-4 adsorbs 1-naphthol driven principally by enthalpy change, while the adsorption onto hydrophilic NDA-150 driven mainly by entropy change. The breakthrough and the total sorption capacity of NDA-150 to 1-naphthol were obtained to be 1.10 and 1.58 mmol mL

58249142275	Impregnating titanium phosphate nanoparticles onto a porous cation exchanger for enhanced lead removal from waters	Titanium phosphate (TiP) exhibits preferable sorption toward lead ion in the presence of competing calcium ions at high levels, however, it is present as fine or ultrafine particles and cannot be directly employed in fixed-bed or any flow-through systems due to the excessive pressure drop and poor mechanical strength. In the present study a new hybrid sorbent TiP-001 was fabricated by impregnating titanium phosphate (TiP) nanoparticles onto a strongly acidic cation exchanger D-001 for enhanced lead removal from waters. D-001 was selected as a host material mainly because of the Donnan membrane effect resulting from the immobilized sulfonic acid groups bound on the exchanger matrix, which would enhance permeation of the target metal cation prior to effective sequestration. TiP-001 was characterized by transmission electron micrograph (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and pH-titration. Batch and column sorption onto TiP-001 was assayed to evaluate its performance as compared to the host exchanger D-001. Lead sorption onto TiP-001 is a pH-dependent process due to the ion-exchange nature, and its sorption kinetics follows the pseudo-second-order model well. Compared to D-001, TiP-001 displays highly selective lead sorption in the presence of competing calcium cations at concentration of several orders higher than the target metal. Fixed-bed sorption of a synthetic feeding solution indicates that lead retention by TiP-001 results in a conspicuous decrease of this toxic metal from 0.50 to below 0.010 mg/L (drinking water standard recommended by WHO). Moreover, its feasible regeneration by dilute HCl solution also favors TiP-001 to be a feasible sorbent for enhanced lead removal from water. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67349286796	Critical review in adsorption kinetic models	Adsorption is one of the most widely applied techniques for environmental remediation. Its kinetics are of great significance to evaluate the performance of a given adsorbent and gain insight into the underlying mechanisms. There are lots of references available concerning adsorption kinetics, and several mathematic models have been developed to describe adsorption reaction and diffusion processes. However, these models were frequently employed to fit the kinetic data in an unsuitable or improper manner. This is mainly because the boundary conditions of the associated models were, to a considerable extent, ignored for data modeling. Here we reviewed several widely-used adsorption kinetic models and paid more attention to their boundary conditions. We believe that the review is of certain significance and improvement for adsorption kinetic modeling. © 2009 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

All the associated adsorption isotherms are well described by Freundlich and Langmuir equations. The results indicated that all the four resins spontaneously adsorb phenol driven mainly by enthalpy change, and their adsorption capacities, free energy changes, enthalpy changes, and entropy changes for phenol followed the same order as: NDA-101 > NDA-103 > XAD-4 > IRA-96. Surface energy heterogeneity analysis by Do's model also suggested that the surfaces of XAD-4 and IRA-96 were more homogeneous, and the better adsorption capacity and affinity of the aminated resins (NDA-101 and NDA-103) are probably due to their multiple hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking interactions with phenol molecule. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

67649791879	Adsorption and desorption hysteresis of 4-nitrophenol on a hyper-cross-linked polymer resin NDA-701	Removal and recovery of aromatic pollutants from water by solid adsorbents have been of considerable concern recently. Relatively limited information is available on desorption kinetics and isotherms aspects. In the present study, batch desorption experiments of loaded 4-nitrophenol on a hyper-cross-linked polymer resin NDA-701, a polymeric adsorbent Amberlite XAD-4 and a granular activated carbon GAC-1 were carried out to study the effects of reaction temperature and pore-size distribution of adsorbents. 4-Nitrophenol desorbed rapidly in the early stages, followed by a much slower release, which was described well by a first-order two-component four-parameter model. The adsorption and desorption equilibrium isotherms were well described by Freundlich equation and the apparent adsorption-desorption hysteresis (hysteresis index) for 4-nitrophenol followed an order as: NDA-701 ≈ XAD-4 ≪ GAC-1. Analysis of adsorption-desorption process suggested that higher reaction temperature and larger proportion of macropore of adsorbents favoured desorption kinetic and reduced adsorption-desorption hysteresis. All the results indicated that NDA-701, with a specific bimodal property in macro- and micropore region, had excellent potential as an adsorption material for achieving high removal and recovery of 4-nitrophenol from the contaminated water. These results will also advance the understanding of the adsorption and desorption behavior of hyper-cross-linked polymer resin in the wastewater treatment systems. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

69949092730	Development of polymer-based nanosized hydrated ferric oxides (HFOs) for enhanced phosphate removal from waste effluents	Phosphate originated from industrial effluents is one of the key factors responsible for eutrophication of the receiving waterways especially in the developing countries such as China. In the current study we proposed a novel process to immobilize nanoparticulate hydrated ferric oxide (HFO) within a macroporous anion exchange resin D-201, and obtained a hybrid adsorbent (HFO-201) for enhanced phosphate removal from aqueous system. The resulting HFO-201 possesses two types of adsorption sites for phosphate removal, the ammonium groups bound to the D-201 matrix and the loaded HFO nanoparticles. The coexisting sulfate anion strongly competes for ammonium groups, which bind phosphate through electrostatic interaction. However, it does not pose any noticeable effect on phosphate adsorption by the loaded HFO nanoparticles, which is driven by the formation of the inner-sphere complexes. Batch adsorption experiments also indicated that HFO-201 exhibits a little higher capacity for phosphate than the commercially available phosphate-specific adsorbent ArsenX

D-001 was selected as a support material mainly because of the potential Donnan membrane effect exerted by the immobilized negatively charged sulfonic acid groups bound to the polymeric matrix, which would result in preconcentration and permeation enhancement of lead ions prior to their effective sequestration by the impregnated HMO. HMO-001 was characterized by scanning electron micrograph (SEM), transmission electron micrograph (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

77950944984	A new approach to catalytic degradation of dimethyl phthlate by a macroporous OH-type strongly basic anion exchange resin	In the present study, a novel approach was developed to remove dimethyl phthalate (DMP), a representative phthalic acid ester (PAE) pollutant, from an aqueous solution using a macroporous OH-type strong base anion exchange resin D201-OH. As compared to the traditional catalyst aqueous NaOH, D201-OH displayed much higher catalytic efficiency for DMP hydrolytic degradation. Almost 100% of DMP was hydrolyzed to far less toxic phthalic acid (PA) in the presence of D201-OH, while only about 29% of DMP was converted to PA in the presence of NaOH under the identical amount of hydroxyl anions in the reaction system. More attractively, the hydrolysis product PA also can be simultaneously removed by the solid basic polymer D201-OH through a preferable anion exchange process, while NaOH induced hydrolysis products were still left in solution. The underlying mechanism for the hydrolytic degradation and simultaneous ion exchange removal process was proposed. Fixed-bed column hydrolytic degradation and ion exchange removal tests indicate that DMP can be completely converted to PA and subsequently removed from water without any further process, with pH values of the effluent being around 6 constantly. The exhausted D201-OH was amenable to an efficient regeneration by 3 bed volumes (BV) of NaOH solution (2 mol/L) for repeated use without any efficiency loss. The results reported herein indicated that D201-OH-induced catalytic degradation and removal is a promising approach for PAEs treatment in waters. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

Two polymeric exchangers, a polystyrene-sulfonic cation exchanger, D-001, and an iminodiacetic acid chelating exchanger, Amberlite IRC 748, were involved for comparison. Hydrogen ion release is accompanied by metal uptake onto HMO, implying that metal sorption could be generally represented by an ion-exchange process. As compared to both exchangers, HMO exhibits preferable sorption toward the toxic metals in the presence of Ca(II) ions at greater levels. FT-IR of the HMO samples laden with different metals indicate that Ca(II) uptake onto HMO is mainly driven by outer-sphere complexation, while that of three toxic metals might be related to inner-sphere complex formation. In addition, uptake of heavy metals onto HMO approaches equilibrium quickly and the exhausted HMO particles can be regenerated readily for repeated use by HCl solution. The results reported strongly display the potential of HMO as an economic and selective sorbent for removal of toxic metals from contaminated waters. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The surface of XAD-7 was demonstrated to be relatively homogeneous through surface energy heterogeneity analysis, offering the sole hydrogen bonding interaction. Contrarily, heterogeneous surface of oxidized resins NDA-702 and the aminated resins NDA-101 exhibited a promising adsorption capacity and affinity toward DMP probably derived by multiple hydrogen bonding, Π-Π stacking, and micropore filling interactions. © 2010 American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

79952563958	Treatment of aqueous diethyl phthalate by adsorption using a functional polymer resin	To study the adsorptive separation efficiency, adsorption and desorption performances of diethyl phthalate (DEP) were investigated with a functional polymer resin (NDA-702). A macroporous polymer resin (XAD-4) and a coal-based granular activated carbon (AC-750) were chosen for comparison. The kinetic adsorption data obeyed the pseudo-second-order rate model, and the adsorption processes were limited by both film and intraparticle diffusions. Adsorption equilibrium data were well fitted by the Freundlich equation, and the larger uptake and higher selection of NDA-702 than AC-750 and XAD-4 was probably due to the microporous structure, phenyl rings and polar groups on NDA-702. Thermodynamic adsorption studies indicated that the test adsorbents spontaneously adsorbed DEP, driven mainly by enthalpy change. Continuous fixed-bed runs demonstrated that there no significant loss of the resin's adsorption capacity and there was complete regeneration of NDA-702. The results suggest that NDA-702 has excellent potential as an adsorption material for water treatment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

Looking at the nanoscale has stimulated the development and use of novel and cost-effective technologies for catalytic degradation, adsorptive removal and detection of contaminants as well as other environmental concerns. Polymer-based nanocomposites (PNCs), which incorporate advantages of both nanoparticles and polymers, have received increasing attention in both academia and industry. They present outstanding mechanical properties and compatibility owing to their polymer matrix, the unique physical and chemical properties caused by the unusually large surface area to volume ratios and high interfacial reactivity of the nanofillers. In addition, the composites provide an effective approach to overcome the bottleneck problems of nanoparticles in practice such as separation and reuse. This article gives an overview of PNCs for environment application. A brief summary of the fabrication methods of PNCs is provided, and recent advances on the application of PNC materials for treatment of contaminants, pollutant sensing and detection and green chemistry are highlighted.

79960459091	Fabrication of anion exchanger resin/nano-CdS composite photocatalyst for visible light RhB degradation	A novel nanocomposite photocatalyst, D201-CdS beads (0.70-0.80mm in diameter), was fabricated for visible light (λ > 420nm) photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB). Sphalerite CdS nanoparticles (5-15nm) were distributed within the outer layer of D201 for favorable visible light permeation. Ultraviolet-visible spectral changes of RhB solution indicated that efficient RhB photodegradation was achieved by D201-CdS under visible light irradiation. More attractively, negligible photocorrosion of the hybrid catalyst D201-CdS was demonstrated by the constant photodegradation efficiency and negligible CdS leaching during five-cycle batch runs. Besides the higher stability, D201-CdS is superior to CdS in terms of separation. The used nanocomposite can be readily separated from solutions by a simple filtration while a high speed centrifugation is needed for the separation of CdS. The above results suggested that the resultant D201-CdS nanocomposite catalyst is promising for practical application in environmental remediation. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.

80053992520	Effect of CdS distribution on the photocatalytic performance of resin-CdS nanocomposites	A nanocomposite, D201-CdS, made by depositing CdS nanoparticles on a resin support (D201) was found to be a promising photocatalyst with visible light response. To elucidate the structure-activity relationship, a set of D201-CdS nanocomposites varying in CdS amount and distribution were prepared by adjusting the concentration of sulfide anion and the precipitation time. The maximum compressive strength of the nanocomposites increased first with the loading of CdS and then declined with the further increase of CdS. There was a valid shell thickness of CdS due to the limitation of visible light in penetration through the resin matrix. Within a certain range of shell thickness, the increase of shell density of CdS would be favorable for the purpose of photodegradation. The shell density could be easily tuned by adjusting the fabrication condition employed in this work, which is an important merit for the potential production and application. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

83955164194	Hydrous ferric oxide-resin nanocomposites of tunable structure for arsenite removal: Effect of the host pore structure	Hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) loaded hybrid sorbents are considered to be excellent materials for arsenic removal from water. However, role of the host pore structure in the performance of the composites is still unclear. In the current study five HFO nanocomposites of similar HFO loadings (3.9-5.3% in Fe mass) were fabricated for arsenite removal, using self-synthesized polystyrene (PS) resins of similar particle sizes but different pore structures as hosts. Structure analysis demonstrated that the particle size of HFO aggregates decreased with decreasing pore size of PS. The adsorption of arsenite onto the nanocomposites with PS of smaller average pore size achieved equilibrium faster. Analysis of kinetic data with the intraparticle diffusion model demonstrated that arsenite adsorption onto PS-HFO nanocomposites with larger HFO particles was controlled by intraparticle diffusion whereas the limitation caused by intraparticle diffusion was weakened as the particle size of HFO decreased. The adsorption capacity of the hybrid adsorbents increased with decreased pore size of PS. These results indicated that the pore structure of the support materials would play a significant role in the performance of nanoparticle-loaded porous adsorbents. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84858288339	Heavy metal removal from water/wastewater by nanosized metal oxides: A review	Nanosized metal oxides (NMOs), including nanosized ferric oxides, manganese oxides, aluminum oxides, titanium oxides, magnesium oxides and cerium oxides, provide high surface area and specific affinity for heavy metal adsorption from aqueous systems. To date, it has become a hot topic to develop new technologies to synthesize NMOs, to evaluate their removal of heavy metals under varying experimental conditions, to reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for metal removal based on modern analytical techniques (XAS, ATR-FT-IR, NMR, etc.) or mathematical models, and to develop metal oxide-based materials of better applicability for practical use (such as granular oxides or composite materials). The present review mainly focuses on NMOs' preparation, their physicochemical properties, adsorption characteristics and mechanism, as well as their application in heavy metal removal. In addition, porous host supported NMOs are particularly concerned because of their great advantages for practical application as compared to the original NMOs. Also, some magnetic NMOs were included due to their unique separation performance. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84862569207	Efficient As(III) removal by macroporous anion exchanger-supported Fe-Mn binary oxide: Behavior and mechanism	Fe-Mn binary oxide is a promising material for As(III) removal through a combined oxidation and adsorption process. To improve its applicability in column or other flow-through systems, we developed a new nanocomposite motivated by the Donnan membrane principle, i.e., Fe-Mn binary oxide encapsulated within a polystyrene anion exchanger D201 (designated D201-Fe/Mn), for efficient As(III) removal from water. As compared to single Fe(III) oxide-loaded D201, the resultant D201-Fe/Mn was less sensitive to pH variation in the range of 4-10 and exhibited higher As(III) capacity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed that As(III) was oxidized to As(V) by Mn(IV) oxide during its sequestration by D201-Fe/Mn, whereas Mn(IV) was reduced to MnOOH

84862650279	Development of cation exchanger-based nano-CdS hybrid catalyst for visible-light photodegradation of rhodamine B from water	A new polymeric nanocomposite photocatalyst A15-CdS with large spherical beads (0.70-0.80 mm in diameter) was fabricated for efficient Rhodamine B (RhB) photodegradation with facile separation during cyclic runs, and photocorrosion, a congenital drawback of CdS, was successfully inhibited for A15-CdS. The nanocomposite catalyst was obtained by impregnating CdS nanoparticles within porous polymeric cation exchanger A15 through a facile inner-surface deposition. CdS nanoparticles (<20 nm) immobilized in A15 were deliberately distributed within an outside ring-like region of 40-50 μm in depth, which is dominant for photoreaction because visible light is not expected to permeate through the inner region of nontransparent A15. As expected, efficient RhB photodegradation by A15-CdS was achieved under visible light irradiation, and large-size A15-CdS beads are expected to result in their facile separation from solution for repeated use. More significantly, negligible photocorro-sion for the hybrid catalyst A15-CdS was demonstrated by the constant photodegradation efficiency and negligible CdS loss during five-cycle runs. The results indicated that nano-CdS immobilization within A15 would greatly improve the applicability of CdS nanoparticles in practical environmental remediation. © 2012 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0036894915	Adsorption of aromatic acids on an aminated hypercrosslinked macroporous polymer	In the present study a hypercrosslinked macroporous polymer CHA-111 was chemically modified by amination with dimethylamine. Adsorption of five aromatic acids on the modified polymer MCH-111 was investigated and adsorption capacities of aromatic acids from aqueous solution increased significantly after amination. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations were employed to fit the adsorption processes to describe adsorption mechanism. Hydrogen-bonding interaction should be regarded as a fundamental contributor to increasing adsorption capacities of aromatic acids on MCH-111. Surface structure of MCH-111 caused by postcrosslinking reaction will enhance the NPM-matrix interaction and then lead to higher activity of amino group on MCH-111 than a macroporous weakly anion exchanger D301. The negative isosteric enthalpy changes for adsorption of benzenesulfonic acid and naphthalenesulfonic acid indicate an exothermic process on the aminated polymer. © Elsevier Science B.V.

84867232363	The correlation between structural characteristics of activated carbons and their adsorption of organic solutes from aqueous solutions	Adsorption is controlled by an array of attractive forces between adsorbent, adsorbate, and solvent molecules. Such forces work interactively, making the interpretation and prediction of sorption processes difficult. By carefully designing the experimental matrix, the effects of adsorbent surface chemistry and pore structure on the adsorption of aromatic compounds were isolated from the complicated web of interactions. Two parameters, γ and δ, were created to describe the relative adsorption affinity index of activated carbons to adsorbates and the occupancy rate of activated carbons by active sites that can lead to formation of water clusters. Taking the space availability and the relative adsorption affinity index into account, a correlation between the Freundlich adsorption affinity coefficient and the characteristics of adsorbent was established. With this correlation, if the Freundlich adsorption affinity coefficient of a compound on one carbon is known, its adsorption affinity coefficient on another carbon might be predictable if the surface chemistries and pore structures of both carbons are available. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Amorphous zirconium phosphate (ZrP), is generally acknowledged to be cation exchanger, little is known the sorption behaviors toward anionic pollutants. In the present study, ZrP was fabricated and the enhanced sorption properties towards anion-phosphate were explored.

Here we prepared a hybrid adsorbent (HFO-CMPS) by dispersing nanosized HFOs onto an inactive porous polymeric support (i.e., chloromethylated polystyrene, CMPS). A surface complexation model (SCM) was employed to quantitatively evaluate the acid-base reactions and adsorption behaviors of HFO-CMPS as compared to the bare HFOs. Results demonstrated that the intrinsic equilibrium constants for acid-base reactions of surface sites of HFOs distinctly changed upon loading, that is, the log K

Here a recyclable aminated hyper-cross-linked polymeric adsorbent (NDA-802) featured with aminated functional groups, large specific surface area, and sufficient micropore region was synthesized for effective removal of EfOM from the bio-treated coking wastewater (BTCW), and its removal characteristics was investigated.

As compared to the abiotic experiments, phenol preloaded with NDA-802 could be effectively desorbed and biodegraded, and the bioregenerated NDA-802 could be employed for multiple use. The concentration gradient hypothesis could interpret such bioregeneration process reasonably. A slight drop in adsorption capacity of NDA-802 after bioregeneration possibly resulted from the mesopore blockage by microbial metabolic by-products. In general, bioregeneration could serve as a potential choice for the exhausted hyper-cross-linked polymeric resin in wastewater treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84879610226	Mathematically modeling fixed-bed adsorption in aqueous systems	Adsorption is one of the widely used processes in the chemical industry environmental application. As compared to mathematical models proposed to describe batch adsorption in terms of isotherm and kinetic behavior, insufficient models are available to describe and predict fixed-bed or column adsorption, though the latter one is the main option in practical application. The present review first provides a brief summary on basic concepts and mathematic models to describe the mass transfer and isotherm behavior of batch adsorption, which dominate the column adsorption behavior in nature. Afterwards, the widely used models developed to predict the breakthrough curve, i.e., the general rate models, linear driving force (LDF) model, wave propagation theory model, constant pattern model, Clark model, Thomas model, Bohart-Adams model, Yoon-Nelson model, Wang model, Wolborska model, and modified dose-response model, are briefly introduced from the mechanism and mathematical viewpoint. Their basic characteristics, including the advantages and inherit shortcomings, are also discussed. This review could help those interested in column adsorption to reasonably choose or develop an accurate and convenient model for their study and practical application. © 2013 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

HZO-201 exhibited much higher preference than activated alumina and D201 toward fluoride removal when competing anions (chloride, sulfate, nitrate, and bicarbonate) coexisted at relatively high levels. Fixed column adsorption indicated that the effective treatable volume of water with HZO-201 was about 7-14 times as much as with D201 irrespective of whether synthetic solution or groundwater was the feeding solution. In addition, HZO-201 could treat >3000 BV of the acidic effluent (around 3.5 mg F

84882774284	Oxalate-promoted dissolution of hydrous ferric oxide immobilized within nanoporous polymers: Effect of ionic strength and visible light irradiation	Oxalate is supposed to affect the applicability of hydrated ferric oxide (HFO)-based composites for environmental remediation because it would enhance HFO dissolution. Here, we examined the effect of ionic strength and visible light irradiation on the oxalate-induced dissolution of HFO, which is supported by two porous polystyrene beads binding chloromethyl groups (P-C) and sulfonate groups (P-S) respectively. As compared to the bare HFO, the dissolution of the immobilized HFO was considerably slower as a result of the slower oxalate adsorption. Compared to P-C, P-S could favor HFO dispersion greatly and achieve HFO nanoparticles of smaller size and higher surface area, resulting in more oxalate uptake with HFO-P-S than with HFO-P-C and a faster dissolution of the former composite. Increasing ionic strength from 0.01 to 0.1. M did not expose any significant effect on the dissolution kinetics of the bare HFO, but apparently promoted HFO dissolution for both composites. In the presence of visible light irradiation, an obvious photochemical reduction of Fe(III) into Fe(II) was observed for the bare HFO, which greatly promoted the iron leaching from solid to solution. However, it did not occur for both composites because the solid polymers keep the inside HFO nanoparticles from light irradiation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Results indicated that the ethanol-induced procedure improved the dispersion of HFO inside the polymer host D201 and increased the HFO sorption capacities towards arsenate by 20%. Also, the ethanol-induced procedure resulted in the increase of pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area of D201-HFO by 52%, 65% and 28%, respectively. Nevertheless, ethanol rinsing did not affect the mechanical strength of D201-HFO and the crystal type of the immobilized HFO. Little effects of the ethanol process was observed on the pH and co-anion dependent adsorption of arsenate. Furthermore, the ethanol step posed insignificant influence on the fix-bed adsorption and the repeated use of the adsorbent. The results showed that the ethanol procedure exerted little influence on the sorption properties of D201-HFO from the viewpoint of practical application and thus, it could not be included.

NZP exhibited efficient removal of lead and cadmium ions in a pH range of 2-6, where no Zr(IV) leaching was detected from NZP. As compared to D-001, NZP showed more preferable adsorption toward both toxic metals from the background Ca(II) solution at greater levels. The synthetic Pb(II) or Cd(II) solution containing other ubiquitous metal ions was employed as the feeding influent for column adsorption, and the results indicated that the treatable volume of NZP is around 3-4 times that of D-001 before reaching the breakthrough point set according to the effluent discharge standard of China. With respect to Pb(II) removal from an acidic mining effluent, the treatable volume of NZP was 13 times higher than that of D-001. The exhausted NZP could be effectively regenerated by HNO

Fe(III) dissolution of HFO-D001 in the presence of EDTA in solution under various experimental conditions, such as EDTA concentration, dissolution time, solution pH and coexisting ions, were examined. At pH=3, Fe(III) dissolution from HFO-D001 was enhanced significantly as EDTA concentration increased. However, under pH=5 and 7, negligible Fe(III) was detected in solution due to the protection of the polymer host and the electrostatic repulsion between EDTA and sulfonic acid groups of D001.

The resultant adsorbents (denoted as HFO-201 and IOCCS) were employed for Sb(V) removal from water. Increasing solution pH from 3 to 9 apparently weakened Sb(V) removal by both composites, while increasing temperature from 293 to 313 K only improved Sb(V) uptake by IOCCS.

84897825643	Regeneration of lead-preloaded amino methylene phosphonic acid resin using hydrochloric acid	The amino methylene phosphonic acid resin (APAR) has been widely used for heave metal sequestration from water, and it exhibits high selectivity towards Pb(II) removal. However, regeneration of the Pb(II)-loaded resin is still a challenging task. Here the desorption of Pb(II) loaded by D860 was studied by using hydrochloric acid as the desorption agent, and the factors affecting the desorption were optimized. The results showed that HCl exhibited satisfactory desorption efficiency, and only 10 min was needed to reach desorption equilibrium for D860 preloaded with lead ion at 10% saturated capacity. And the desorption was limited by the solubility of Pb(II) in HCl solution.

84901369697	A new polymer-based laccase for decolorization of AO7: Long-term storage and mediator reuse	To address the bottlenecks of laccase-based catalysis, i.e., poor long-term stability and potential secondary pollution caused by synthetic mediator, we fabricated a new biocatalyst (N-PS-Lac) through adsorption of laccase onto polystyrene anion exchangers (N-PS) binding quaternary ammonium groups. After 2-year storage, the residual activity of N-PS-Lac remained as high as 101.7%, while that for native laccase was only 14.6%. Also, N-PS-Lac exhibited improved durability against pH variation and thermal treatment at 60. °C. Gaussian curve fitting of FT-IR spectra indicated that laccase conformation of N-PS-Lac was rigidified, possibly because of the host geometric restriction and the host-laccase electrostatic attraction. A two-step method, i.e., adsorption of an azo dye AO7 by N-PS and then ectopic degradation by the immobilized laccase, was proposed to reuse the mediator HOBT for seven cyclic runs, where N-PS-Lac kept the constant decolorization efficiency. AO7 solution was detoxified completely after decolorization by the two-step method. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Glutaraldehyde was used as cross-linking agent. Chitosan thin-film was well coated onto the surface of the polystyrene (PS) beads characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). Their adsorption toward Cu(II) ions was investigated as a function of solution pH, degree of cross-linking, equilibrium Cu(II) ions concentration and contact time. The maximum adsorptive capacity of PS-CS was 99.8. mg/g in the adsorption isotherm study. More attractively, the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 10. min, which showed superior properties among similar adsorbents. Continuous adsorption-desorption cyclic results demonstrated that Cu(II)-loaded PS-CS can be effectively regenerated by a hydrochloric acid solution (HCl), and the regenerated composite beads could be employed for repeated use without significant capacity loss, indicating the good stability of the adsorbents. The XPS analysis confirmed that the adsorption process was due to surface complexes with atoms of chitosan. Generally, PS beads could be employed as a promising host to fabricate efficient composites that originated from chitosan or other bio-sorbents for environmental remediation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905918409	Recyclable polymer-based nano-hydrous manganese dioxide for highly efficient Tl(I) removal from water	Tl(I) in water even at a trace level is fatal to human beings and the ecosystem. Here we fabricated a new polymer-supported nanocomposite (HMO-001) for efficient Tl(I) removal by encapsulating nanosized hydrous manganese dioxide (HMO) within a polystyrene cation exchanger (D-001). The resultant HMO-001 exhibited more preferable removal of Tl(I) than D-001 and IRC-748, an iminodiacetic chelating polymer, particularly in the presence of competing Ca(II) ions at greater levels in solution. Such preference was ascribed to the Donnan membrane effect caused by D-001 as well as the specific interaction between Tl(I) and HMO. The adsorbed Tl(I) was partially oxidized into insoluble Tl(III) by HMO at acidic pH, while negligible oxidation was observed at circumneutral pH. The exhausted HMO-001 was amenable to efficient regeneration by binary NaOH-NaClO solution for at least 10-cycle batch runs without any significant capacity loss. Fixed-bed column test of Tl(I)-contained industrial effluent and natural water further validated that Tl(I) retention on HMO-001 resulted in a conspicuous concentration drop from 1.3 mg/L to a value lower than 0.14 mg/L (maximum concentration level for industrial effluent regulated by US EPA) and from 1-4 μg/L to a value lower than 0.1 μg/L (drinking water standard regulated by China Health Ministry), respectively. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Initial pH, sulfate concentration, operating temperature, and adsorbent dosage were chosen as four variables for the batch study, while the removal efficiency was considered as the output. A central composite design (CCD) was referred to design 33 sets of batch experiments, and a RSM model was developed to compare with the ANN model. The three-layer feed-forward back-propagation network was established in MATLAB to estimate the phosphate removal efficiency. The positive behavior of both models was verified by Pearson and Spearman coefficient and mean squared error (MSE). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests and sensitivity analysis were performed on the models to find relative influence of four variables. Temperature was deemed as the least influential whereas the other three variables were considered significant to the output. Genetic Algorithm (GA) was employed to find optimum dosages for a desired removal efficiency under given conditions. ANN modeling was further attempted to estimate the breakthrough curves of fixed-bed adsorption, where pH, sulfate, temperature, flow rate (BV/h) and bed volume was considered as variables. Predictions made by the developed models were in reasonably good agreement with the test runs. This study suggested that ANN and RSM be considered as effective tools to model and predict trace pollutants removal by nanocomposite adsorbents. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
