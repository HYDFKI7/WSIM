0031273223	Design and implementation of a high speed ATM network interface card	In the cell-based ATM network environment, the data must be fast processed to take advantage of the underlying huge transmission bandwidth. There is no room to use the software for the cell-based protocol processing - all cell-based processing ought to be done in hardware. We have conducted an ATM/TAXI interface card design for the ISA-bus based PC host. The goal is to build a high speed communication interface which performs all cell-based protocol processing. Based on this interface, we can further experiment our control mechanism for supporting the multimedia application on the PC platform. Two FPGAs that support the TAXI interface and the ATM/AAL5 functions are implemented. A parallel CRC algorithm is derived and its associated hardware circuits for the CRC-32 of the AAL5 and the HEC of the ATM header are also implemented in the ATM/AAL5 chips. This working ATM network interface card enables our further research on the ATM technology.

29144495946	Causal-ordered real-time communications of grid computing on the internet	Grid computing is a state-of-the-art parallel computing technology which enables worldwide computers to dynamically share their computing powers and resource to each other. The grid takes advantage of Internet as a universal communication platform to carry messages. Basically, Internet doesn't guarantee loss-free and ordered transmission, hence, the grid should keep the cause and effect of events by itself to ensure the correct ordering of command invocations at the remote hosts. The ordering issue arises when the messages travel across the networks with unpredictable delay. Recent research has studied the security and resource control issues, but failed to address the requirements of transport layer on the grid communication platform. In this paper, we propose the Causal Ordered Grid (COG) architecture and implement it to study the transport performance issues when the grid is built over worldwide networks. The COG provides a novel service model to the applications with time-sensitive and causal-ordered transportation. From our experiments, the design of the grid middleware should use a causal-ordered, time-sensitive transportation rather than TCP. Our research will be beneficial to the improvement of the grid computing and can provide wealthy empirical results for the designer.

33745469267	A high-performance low power direct 2-D transform coding IP design for MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 with a switching power suppression technique	This paper proposes a high-performance low-power direct 2-D transform coding IP design for H.264 with a switching power suppression technique. The proposed transform coding design not only suitably arranges the data sequences in row and column transforms to greatly increase the data processing rate but also takes advantage of the correlation existed in natural video sequences to suppress the spurious switching power. When compared with the parallel transform architecture [2], this design possesses 4 times higher data processing rate (in terms of pixels/cycle) and 3.52 times higher throughput (in terms of pixels/sec) at the cost of 1.80 times hardware cost in computing the multi-transform for H.264. In addition, without voltage scaling, the power consumed by the proposed forward transform design is only 35% of that consumed by the forward transform design in [2] to maintain the same throughput. When the proposed switching power suppression technique is applied, the proposed transform design can perform digital cinema video coding format by consuming only 1.86 mW. © 2005 IEEE.

33749859302	An area-efficient variable length decoder IP core design for MPEG-1/2/4 video coding applications	This paper proposes an area-efficient variable length decoder (VLD) IP core design for MPEG-1/2/4 video coding applications. The proposed IP core exploits the parallel numerical matching in the MPEG-1/2/4 entropy decoding to achieve high data throughput rate in terms of limited hardware cost. This feature not only improves the performance of VLD, but also facilitates reducing the power consumption through lowering down the supply voltage while maintaining enough data throughput rate. Moreover, we propose a partial combinational component enabling approach for minimizing the power consumption of the proposed design. Based on 0.18-μm CMOS technology, the implementation results show that the proposed IP core operates at 125-MHz clock frequency with the cost of 13105 gates. In addition, the power consumption of the proposed design reaches 163.4 μW operated at 12.5 MHz with 0.9-V supply voltage, which is fast enough for MPEG-1/2/4 real-time decoding on 4CIF video@30 Hz.

The SPST has been applied on both the modified Booth decoder and the compression tree of multipliers to enlarge the power reduction. The simulation results show that the SPST implementation with AND gates owns an extremely high flexibility on adjusting the data asserting time which not only facilitates the robustness of SPST but also leads to a 40% speed improvement.

34547240889	High speed routing lookup IC design for IPv6	With the growth of Internet users and services, the IP address has been exhausted. In order to solve this problem, the short term solution was presented, i.e., CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing). The long term solution for insufficient IP addresses is the IPv6 protocol which was defined by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). The length of IPv6 address is 128 bits that can avoid the IP address exhaustion. In this paper, a complete hardware for IPv6 routing lookup architecture is proposed. It is composed of routing lookup ASIC and memory set. In our system, the simple hash hardware is used to reduce the lookup time, and the CAM (Content Addressable Memory) is used to solve the collision problem effectively. In our performance analysis, 91.89% routing entries of the routing table can be searched in one memory access, and the worst case about 10% needs two memory accesses. The CAM in the ASIC is used as cache memory with FIFO replacement algorithm. The routing lookup system approaches 213.4Mlps (109.26Gb/s).

34547267278	Low-power mechanism with power block management	In this paper, a low power mechanism with power block management is proposed to reduce the power consumption in DSP chips. Because the digital signal processing (DSP) chips use many functional units in the data-path to achieve parallel processing, the unnecessary functional units are also executed simultaneously, and they dissipate the power. In the paper, we classify the types of instruction sets based on their data flow in the DSP to generate the control signals which active the necessary units in their data-path. The mechanism is called power block management (PBM). We employ particular guarded circuits in the different situations to avoid the actions of unnecessary functional units so as to reduce the power dissipation. The experimental results show that the power consumption can be saved about 14% at the cost of less than 2.7% area increment. © 2006 IEEE.

Particularly, the SMTP attacks and spam varies on email, for example spoofing address, illegal characters, sending in bulk, too many SMTP commands and so on. A single security technique is not enough to protect the system from these attacks and spam.

60649083803	A spurious-power suppression technique for multimedia/DSP applications	This paper presents the design exploration and applications of a spurious-power suppression technique (SPST) which can dramatically reduce the power dissipation of combinational VLSI designs for multimedia/DSP purposes. The proposed SPST separates the target designs into two parts, i.e., the most significant part and least significant part (MSP and LSP), and turns off the MSP when it does not affect the computation results to save power. Furthermore, this paper proposes an original glitch-diminishing technique to filter out useless switching power by asserting the data signals after the data transient period. This paper adopts two multimedia/DSP design examples, i.e., a multitransform design for H.264 and a versatile multimedia functional unit (VMFU), to evaluate the proposed SPST. These two design examples have quite different hardware configurations, thus, the realization issues of the SPST on every design also remarkably differ from each other. The multitransform design can compute three transforms which are required in H.264 encoding while the VMFU possesses six commonly used multimedia/DSP functions, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, MAC, interpolation, and sum-of-absolute-difference. After optimizing the design elaborately, we find that the proposed SPST can, respectively, save 27% and 24% power dissipation on average of the H.264 multitransform design and the VMFU at the expense of less than 20% area augmentation. © 2009 IEEE.

84876778031	Poster abstract: Enabling a cloud-based logging service for ball screw with an autonomous networked sensor system	Precision ball screw assembly (hereafter called "ball screw"), as shown in Fig. 1, is a mechanical wear out part that widely used in CNC (computer numerical control) machine tools to control the movement of processing targets and spindles. Up until now, there has been no simple way to directly measure ball screw for knowing the state of wear quantitatively. An indirect approach is logging all the signals (vibration, temperature, and preload change) during the operation of ball screw, and to use them to construct the wear model for estimating its remaining lifetime. To achieve this goal, we proposed a cloud-based logging system in this study that emphasizes (1) logging all the signals during operation in a ball screw's whole lifetime, and transferring to the data server without data loss; and (2) saving all the data into the cloud data storage of the ball screw's manufacturer. The data collected from many ball screws can be used to analyze and construct the wear model of ball screw, allowing the manufacturer to understand the state of wear and send a warning to the tool machine's owner before excessive wear.

42949166698	Cell search in WCDMA under large-frequency and clock errors: Algorithms to hardware implementation	This paper proposes a complete cell-search solution for real-world handset operations in the wide-band code-division multiple-access system. Large-frequency and clock errors are induced at initial search due to an inaccuracy of crystal oscillators within handsets and could cause fatal performance degradation. In addition to a primary search algorithm for achieving essential pseudo-noise code acquisitions, an enhanced algorithm combining frequency offset compensation, random sample per frame, and sample point reordering is proposed to achieve fast initial search even while an inaccuracy is up to 12 ppm. After a series of trade-off between performance and complexity, two search bins in the first stage are adopted to mitigate possible errors in each bin and make the enhanced schemes become effective. In final, the complete solution is presented with alternative algorithms: a primary one and an enhanced one. The solution is implemented with the flexibility for switching algorithms in different searches and using low-power methods for the sake of handsets' working time. Its core area is 3.8 × 3.8-mm

47849101231	IP local node protection	Network survivability has become one of the most important QoS (Quality of Service) parameters in IP network services. IP protection can improve network resilience and avoid service disruption better than traditional routing recovery or other lower layer recovery technologies. In this paper, we proposed an IP Local Node-Protection (IPLNP) scheme based on the characteristic of shortest path routing in IP networks. Our schemes working in an intra-area routing domain provide simple and efficient solutions to improve IP network survivability. Unlike source-routing-based MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) Fast-Reroute which needs an extra MPLS layer and complex control protocols, our scheme are applicable to a network employing only conventional IP routing and forwarding. Our scheme can prevent service disruption and packet loss caused by the loops which normally occur during the re-convergence of the network upon a failure. Because the backup next hops are predetermined in advance, the service interrupted time can be limited to a few milliseconds. In the simulation results, we observe that IP Local Node-Protection scheme can efficiently improve network survivability while single node failure occurs. © 2007 IEEE.

47849108506	Energy Residue Aware (ERA) clustering algorithm for leach-based wireless sensor networks	Many energy efficient routing protocols have been proposed in sensor networks for different scenarios and various applications in literature. One of the efficient way is to group sensors in the neighboring into clusters and send aggregate data by a designated cluster head. However, such design discipline still can not balance the energy consumption of the entire network. As such, in worst cases, some nodes may be soon exhausted. Consequently, it is difficult to provide effective operation and seamless coverage in such a network. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering associating algorithm, known as Energy Residue Aware (ERA) clustering algorithm, to prolong the lifetime of a sensor network by balancing the energy consumption of the entire network. ERA enables each sensor to associate its cluster head to find a path with maximum energy residue sum instead of a path with the minimum energy consumption. Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance in terms of the network lifetime and energy distribution among nodes. Numerical results show that proposed ERA can maintain a balanced energy consumption distribution among nodes in a sensor network and thus prolong the network lifetime. © 2007 IEEE.

70449454796	Pushout with global thresholds buffer control scheme in a shared buffer ATM switch	In this paper, a buffer management scheme called pushout with global thresholds (PGT) is proposed for a shared buffer ATM switch. The PGT can be viewed as the combination of the per-port basis pushout and the global threshold schemes. The key idea of the global threshold scheme is to separate the output ports into active and inactive output ports according to whether their queue lengths are larger than the fair buffer allocation factor or not When the remained buffer size is larger than a certain threshold value, all arrival cells are accepted. Otherwise, only the cells destined for inactive output ports are admitted to enter the shared buffer. The simulation study of the global threshold scheme is applied to a shared buffer ATM switch under the per-port basis pushout mechanism. Unlike the selective pushout (SP) scheme, the PGT scheme is simple to implement and easy to maintain. Computer simulation shows that PGT control is very robust and efficient to support much better fairness among different output queues, lower overall cell loss probability, with near loss probability of high priority cells than SP control. © 2002 IEEE.

77949883347	High speed UDP/IP ASIC design	With the growing of internet service, multimedia applications require higher communication speed. The network traffic has rapidly increased that produces amount of interrupts, memory copies and checksum calculation in end system. The CPU workload is heavy and the processing of network protocol task is the bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a UDP/IP ASIC to accelerate networking multimedia transmission. The checksum hardware just calculates packet header instead of whole packet with payload for UDP packet so that it can reduce the processing clock cycles for multimedia delivery. Besides, because of the Gigabit NIC support Jumbo Frame mostly, we figure out the packet size adopted 9Kbyte from which the performance is higher than the traditional 1.5KByte. As the results of simulation, the speed of the chip is 227.2MHz and the area is 0.936 * 0.733 mm2. The power consumption without SRAM is 7.21 mW.

79251516383	A low-cost MMSE-SIC detector for the MIMO system: Algorithm and hardware implementation	We consider the minimum mean-squared error with successive interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC) detection of a frame of data in the spatially multiplexed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system. A complete MMSE-SIC detector needs to compute at both the preprocessing and SIC-detection stages. Since the SIC detection, which can be regarded as a backward substitution, is inevitable, we develop a computationally efficient preprocessing algorithm that relies on the backward substitution. We then propose a low-cost hardware architecture with a commonly shared backward-substitution module to work at both the preprocessing and detection stages. The very-large-scale-integration implementation results of our architecture for the four-by-four MIMO system using the 0.18-μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology reveal that our architecture requires the fewest 79-K gates, provides the high throughput rate of 416 Mb/s, and works with the smallest preprocessing latency of 64 clock cycles. Our MMSE-SIC detector is a cheap solution for MIMO detection. © 2006 IEEE.

0036461144	Partial sharing and partial partitioning buffer management scheme for shared buffer packet switches	In a shared buffer packet switch, a good buffer management scheme is needed to reduce the overall packet loss probability and improve the fairness between different users. In this paper, a novel buffer control scheme called partial sharing and partial partitioning (PSPP) is proposed. The PSPP is an adaptive scheme that can be dynamically adjusted to the changing traffic conditions while simple to implement. The key idea of the PSPP is that part of the buffer space, proportional to the number of inactive output ports, is reserved for sharing between inactive output ports. This portion of buffer is called PS buffer. The residual buffer space, called PP buffer, is partitioned and distributed to active output ports equally. From the analysis results, we only need to reserve a small amount of PS buffer space to get good performance for the entire system. Computer simulation shows the PSPP control is very robust and very close to the performance of pushout (PO) buffer management scheme which is a scheme considered as optimal in terms of fairness and total loss ratio while too complicated for implementation.

79959217443	A design of bandwidth adaptive multimedia gateway for scalable video coding	Delivering multimedia streaming on Internet remains several limitations, such as bandwidth fluctuations and network conjunction. We present a multimedia gateway design including dynamic bandwidth estimation, SVC extractor and buffer management to resolve the limitations. The dynamic bandwidth estimation not only selects the appropriate SVC sub-stream, but also measures the change of bandwidth and packet loss with multimedia transmission. When the network congestion happened, the buffer management picks the important one from all packets. Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) is used to increase peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of video stream. Comparing four WRED schemes, we figure out that Disjoint setting can get higher average of PSNR. The result shows that PSNR is elevated in the system proposed by us. © 2010 IEEE.

84862908164	An integrated two-tier multicast-agent architecture for all-IP multicast transport services	Current group communication applications need to overcome inter-domain and heterogeneous multicast transport challenges. All-IP multicast over Internet is proposed to achieve the efficiency and transparency on IP multicast packet delivery not only for native IP multicast domains, but also for non-IP multicast supported domains. To guarantee the efficient IP multicast packet delivery over heterogeneous networks, therefore application level multicast (ALM) and overlay multicast (OM) were introduced for the connectivity of inter-domain coordination and local hetero-geneous access. In this paper, we propose two-tier multicast agent (MA) mechanism to integrate ALM with overlay tunnel connections to inter-domain multicast and network level connections to local heterogeneous multicast access. In our experimental results, the proposed MA mechanism can achieve all-IP multicast transport services with multicast packet transmission over inter-domain and heterogeneous local wired/wireless access networks. © 2011 IEEE.

84862922219	Multi-layered monitoring framework with indices relationship analysis for distributed service performance evaluation	System performance monitoring accumulates and analyzes performance information to detect and evaluate anomaly performance behavior. Recent advances in Internet-based services have led to an increasing variety and complexity. Abnormal service operations adversely impact other services, making it extremely difficult to identify and resolve anomaly performance behavior. This work describes a novel multi-layered framework to monitor multiple system layers simultaneously, including server layer, network layer, database layer, data processing layer, and user interface layer. By providing a comprehensive perspective of system monitoring, this work elucidates how performance indices across different system layers are related to information technicians attempting to explain abnormal system performances and resolve them. A state matrix structure is also developed for recording state information of system performance. Based on a state matrix database, the state information of new anomaly performance is inferred to resolve performance problems. A performance analysis and evaluation case study of the Social Media Analysis Platform demonstrates how to reduce administrative burden according to explain abnormal performance and resolve anomalies efficiently. © 2011 IEEE.

This paper introduced an idea called Indexes' Concept Map (ICM) Construction Algorithm based on vocabulary analysis in order to solve the problems. Indexes' concept map makes vocabularies (keywords) linked together with association factors. With analysis of vaguely-structured (non-structured or semi-structured) internet documents, ICM Construction Algorithm may extract vocabularies from documents and link these vocabularies together in indexes' concept map. Following, ICM Construction Algorithm classifies documents into indexes' concept map by vector space model. Because of documents classification by multi-words in ICM, more than single words, it makes documents classified to each keyword more precisely and reduces huge quantity documents in keyword search. This paper also proposed system design of Indexes' Concept Map Construction Subsystem for search engine. User searches by the search engine may get visualize indexes' concept map with documents links. Indexes' Concept Map makes user handling results from search engine efficiently. Indexes' Concept Map Construction Algorithm both reduces the problems of huge quantity and fuzziness of documents from search engine.

0037347415	Pushout with virtual thresholds buffer management scheme in a shared buffer ATM switch	In this paper we investigate the performance metrics of buffer management schemes. In general, the selective pushout (SP) scheme can support very low loss probability of the high-priority cells, but it may cause unfairness of buffer allocation among different output queues and high overall cell loss probability. In order to fit the dynamic required performance metrics of ATM switches, a novel buffer management scheme called pushout with virtual thresholds (PVT) is proposed. In the PVT scheme, each output queue is guaranteed to increase in length until its virtual threshold (VT). Simulation results show the PVT can dynamically achieve the fairness and low overall cell loss probability or very low loss probability of the high priority cells by adequately adjusting the VT. Specially, when the VT = 0, the PVT control can be viewed as the SP control. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A transient analysis of TSD is derived to prove the fairness of buffer allocation. Computer simulation shows that the overall loss performance of TSD approaches to the pushout (PO) scheme, which is considered as an optimal solution with implementation difficulties in high-speed Internet. However, unlike the PO, the TSD will block the unwanted packets before they enter the queue, and does not need to pre-empty the queue for accepting new packets.

84870004991	Self-configured fair queueing	Many core-stateless mechanisms such as core-stateless fair queueing (CSFQ) and linear fair sharing estimation (LFSE) are proposed to address the scalable problem in core routers. These mechanisms rely heavily on the edge router to correctly mark the flow data. As a result, incorrect flow information marked at edge or core routers by mistake or by malicious could severely impact the fairness. In order to be fair, there must be some schemes at the core router to regulate the traffic. A novel fair sharing mechanism called self-configured fair queueing (SCFQ) is presented in this paper. The SCFQ scheme makes use of two rate estimators. One estimator is used to capture and estimate the arrival rate of those malicious or heavily loaded flows. The other estimator is used to calculate the desired fair bandwidth sharing. We use computer simulation to compare the fairness of the CSFQ, LFSE, deficit round robin (DRR), first in first out (FIFO) and SCFQ. The SCFQ is shown to be more robust and efficient to provide better fair bandwidth allocation beyond other proposed mechanisms.

84875221728	A high-throughput and high-capacity IPv6 routing lookup system	With the growing number of routing entries, IP routing lookup has become the major performance bottleneck in backbone routers. In this paper, a complete hardware-based routing lookup system is proposed to achieve high-throughput and high-capacity for IPv6. The proposed system is a cache-centric, hash-based architecture that contains a routing lookup application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a memory set. A hash function is used to reduce lookup time for the routing table and ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) effectively resolves the collision problem. The gate count of the ASIC, excluding the binary content addressable memory (BCAM), is about 5306 gates, using an in-house 0.18 μm CMOS single-poly six-metal standard cell library. The results of post-layout simulations show that the ASIC operates in 3.6 ns so that the routing lookup system approaches 260 Mega lookups per second (Mlps), which is sufficient for 100 Gbps networks. The memory density is good, with each routing entry requiring only 64 bits. Moreover, the routing table only needs 10.24 KB on-chip BCAM, 20.04 KB off-chip TCAM and 29.29 MB DRAM for 3.6 M routing entries in the proposed system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Embedded memory therefore occupies large area and consumes power to store and process pixel data, especially for those low-cost applications without a framebuffer. In this paper, we design a scaling engine with the proposed pixel-based memory access method, which achieves 52% power reduction and 37% line buffer reductions as compared with the conventional line-based memory access method. In addition, it also reduces 10% power consumption for a general noise reduction processing because the pixel-based memory access method can efficiently reduce the memory activity. © 2013 IEEE.

One novel property, found by Sayed about the QR-decomposition (QRD) of this equivalent channel matrix is that the produced Q-and R-matrices are also matrices with Alamouti sub-blocks. Taking advantage of this property, we propose a new block-wise complex Givens rotation (BCGR) based algorithm and a triangular systolic array (TSA) to compute the QRD of the equivalent channel matrix in an Alamouti block by block manner. Implementation results reveal that our new TSA can compute QRDs of 4-by-4 equivalent channel matrices faster than any architecture that has been developed for the SDM MIMO system. This property of fast QRD makes our TSA very attractive for the layered Alamouti STBC MIMO system combined with the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. Our new BCGR based approach can also be applied to the hybrid Alamouti STBC MIMO system, which is also a system with equivalent channel matrix consisting of Alamouti sub-blocks. © 2014 IEEE.

10844275661	Threshold-based filtering buffer management scheme in a shared buffer packet switch	In this paper, an efficient threshold-based filtering (TF) buffer management scheme is proposed. The TF is capable of minimizing the overall loss performance and improving the fairness of buffer usage in a shared buffer packet switch. The TF consists of two mechanisms. One mechanism is to classify the output ports as active or inactive by comparing their queue lengths with a dedicated buffer allocation factor. The other mechanism is to filter the arrival packets of inactive output ports when the total queue length exceeds a threshold value. A theoretical queuing model of TF is formulated and resolved for the overall packet loss probability. Computer simulations are used to compare the overall loss performance of TF, dynamic threshold (DT), static threshold (ST) and pushout (PO). We find that TF scheme is more robust against dynamic traffic variations than DT and ST. Also, although the overall loss performance between TF and PO are close to each other, the implementation of TF is much simpler than the PO.
