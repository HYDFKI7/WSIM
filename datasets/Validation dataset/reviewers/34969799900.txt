15444371191	Oxidative graft polymerization of aniline on the surface of poly(propylene)-graft-polyacrylic acid films	A method for the preparation of electrically conductive poly(propylene) -graft-polyacrylic acid/polyaniline (PP-g-PAA/PANI) composite films was developed. The synthesis was mainly performed by two steps, i.e., the surface graft copolymerization of PP films with acrylic acid induced by ultraviolet (UV) and then chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline. The influence of experimental conditions on graft percentage of PANI on PP-g-PAA films was systematically investigated. It was found that when the polymerization on the surface of PP-g-PAA films was performed in aqueous HCl medium, the optimum aniline concentration was 0.1 M at pH 1. Additionally, UV-visible spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize and analyze the interaction between PAA and aniline, the formation mechanism and the surface structure of the PP-g-PAA/PANI films. The morphologies of the PP-g-PAA/PANI composite films were also detected by scanning electron microscope. The conductivity and the thickness of the composite films with 2 wt.% PANI were about 10

20444465565	Novel pore-covering membrane as a full open/close valve	A pH-switching membrane with novel pore-covering structure was designed and synthesized by photografting 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) onto the poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) track membranes. The membrane has a thin grafting layer, which was confined to the membrane surface rather than inside pores. The ATR-FTIR and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to characterize the photografting polymerization and the configuration of membrane pores in different conditions. The membrane pores are regulated by the grafted poly(4-vinylpyridine) chains, which give a pore-covering effect by stretching over or into the pores. The water fluxes of the grafted membranes have great leap near the pH range of 2-4 even with a very low grafting degree (0.3 wt%). Moreover, the fluxes approximate to that of blank membrane in neutral solution (open state), and close to zero in acidic solution (close state). Different from poly(acrylic acid) grafted membranes, the poor water solubility of poly(4-vinylpyridine) makes the grafting chains float on the surface of water inside pores and no obvious open and close configuration of the membrane pores were observed under AFM. The filtration test indicated that grafted membranes have no retention to both riboflavin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) under pressure driving, whereas diffusion tests showed that both in open and close states, the BSA could be trapped completely at high grafting degree (more than 2.54%) while riboflavin can freely diffuse through the membranes. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

23944474307	Photografting of HSS on the surface of LDPE film by two steps	In order to get the surface of polymer materials acidified effectively, the introduction of strong acid group (sulfonic group) to the surface of LDPE film by photografting polymerization in two steps was investigated. Influences of parameters such as reaction time, monomer concentration, pH value in solution and grafting times on polymerization were examined. The obtained results indicate that prolonging photo reduction time and graft reaction time, increasing monomer concentration and pH value in solution, and grafting for more than once help to the improvement of graft extent. The grafted film was characterized by gravimetric method, water contact angle measurement, infrared spectrum analysis and scanning electron microscope observation.

24044444535	Photo-initiated inverse emulsion graft copolymerization of acrylic acid onto corn starch to prepare super water-absorbent resin	Graft copolymerization of acrylic acid (AA) onto corn starch (ST) initiated by different photoinitiators was carried out in inverse emulsion system using kerosene as reaction medium, and sorbitan monooleate blended with nonylphenol polyoxyethylene ether as emulsifier. Effects of reaction conditions, namely types and mass fraction of photo-initiator, mass fraction of corn starch and emulsifier, and reaction time, on graft copolymerization were investigated. Several photo-initiators could be applied and monomer conversion could reach 65.31%-92.61% within 30 min. The super water-absorbent resin in particle form was prepared by proper cross-linking of the graft copolymer. Water absorption capacity of resin depended on mass fraction of cross-linking agent and its addition manners. Properties and particle size of resin could be improved by second inverse emulsion graft copolymerization.

24644490184	Facile preparation of a patterned, aminated polymer surface by UV-light-induced surface aminolysis	Introducing amine functional groups on polymer surfaces is extremely important for studying various processes that involve polymer surfaces. We report a novel and extremely simple method for preparing a tertiary-amine- terminated poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) surface by using a UV-iight-induced surface aminolysis reaction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and attenuated total-reflection infrared spectroscopy give direct evidence of the incorporation of tertiary amine functionalities and the possible reaction mechanism behind this technique. Tertiary amines are easily protonated, so we have developed an extremely simple method for immobilizing and patterning biomolecules on a soft surface by the electrostatic self-assembly of proteins, such as immunoglobulin (IgG) and horseradish peroxide (HRP), onto a patterned, aminated surface. An enzyme-substrate reaction, which is followed optically by observing the resulting precipitation on the surface, is used to reveal the patterned immobilization of HRP, where 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole, as a substrate for HRP, is deposited on the aminated surface after HRP adsorption. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled IgG (FITC-IgG) has been immobilized electrostatically onto the ordered aminated spots, and the fluorescence intensity ratio of the IgG-immobilized region (inside the spot) to the background (outside the spot) is about 5:1, as calculated from a fluorescence image and fluorescence spectra obtained by microlaser confocal Raman spectroscopy. We have found that the background intensity is mainly caused by the autofluorescence of virgin PET, and after subtracting this value from the measured intensity inside and outside the spot, respectively, a much higher intensity ratio between the spot and the background is obtained (about 22:1). The patterned immobilization of FITC-IgG has been further proven by examining the change in intensity inside the spot after photobleaching the fluorophore. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Some principal factors affecting the microspheres, such as reaction time, monomer concentration and feed ratio, reaction media, and cosolvent, were investigated.

2642536129	Nonaqueous dispersion polymerization of styrene in methanol with the lonomer block copolymer poly[(4-methylstyrene)-co-(4-vinyltriethylbenzyl ammonium bromide)]-b-polyisobutene as a stabilizer	The nonaqueous dispersion polymerization of styrene in methanol with poly[(4-methylstyrene)-co-(4-vinyltriethylbenzyl ammonium bromide)]-b- polyisobutene as a stabilizer was investigated. There was no observable inducing period or autoacceleration in the polymerization process. The conversion increased almost linearly with the polymerization time as high as 80%. The average sizes of the obtained polystyrene particles increased, and the size distributions of the polystyrene particles tended to become narrower, with increasing conversion. The mechanism of the dispersion polymerization in the presence of polyisobutene-b-poly[(4-methylstyrene)-co-(4-vinyltriethylbenzyl ammonium bromide)] was nucleation/growth. When the stabilizer/monomer ratio (w/w) was greater than 2.0%, the polystyrene dispersion was stable, and there was no observable polymer particle coagulation taking place during the whole polymerization process. The average diameter of the polymer particles can be mediated through changes in the polymerization conversion, monomer, and stabilizer. Nearly monodispersed polystyrene particles with average diameters of approximately 0.45-2.21 μm were obtained under optimal conditions. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30344478589	A facile method for grafting polymerisation of acrylonitrile onto LDPE film with high grafting efficiency	A facile and effective surface grafting polymerisation method was designed and investigated to graft acrylonitrile (AN) onto low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film using benzoyl peroxide (BPO) as an initiator. This method consisted of two steps. In the first step, BPO was adsorbed on the surface of LDPE film by immersing LDPE film in BPO solution; in the second step, grafting polymerisation of AN onto LDPE film was carried out under heat. Because the grafting polymerisation was carried out with AN in vapour phase and the concentration of AN was very low, the homopolymerisation of AN could be effectively suppressed and therefore the grafting efficiency was very high (approaching 100%). Grafting percent (Gp) could be controlled from 0 to 118% by adjusting reaction conditions in the first step and/or in the second step respectively. A possible model was proposed to interpret the experimental results. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. Weinheim.

By this method, the fabrication of primary nanoparticles (poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA), the linkers (polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP, chains) between the nanoparticles, and the final assembled solid or hollow particles could be achieved in just one-pot by methyl methacrylate (MMA)/N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) microemulsion polymerization under UV irradiation. The structures of the supramolecular particles can be changed from solid to hollow by tuning the mass ratio of MMA/NVP in the microemulsion.

33746378642	Photografting of unable-to-be-irradiated surfaces. I. Batch vapor-phase process by one-step method	Surfaces unable-to-be-irradiated are those that could not be directly exposed to UV irradiation because of their irregular structure or instability under UV irradiation. It is difficult to conduct surface photografting on these kinds of surfaces with conventional photografting methods. Here, a novel one-step surface photografting method is introduced, by which some monomers were smoothly grafted on the surface of polymer substrates located in a region out of the reach of UV radiation. The mechanism is that the photochemical reaction is separated into three events, absorbing UV light in one place, then transporting light energy to another place, and reacting there; in other words, the conventional photochemical reaction is separated by space and time, and the key point is that the substrate does not need to be exposed to UV irradiation. The occurrence of grafting polymerization was proved by UV-vis, ATR-IR, SEM, XPS, and water contact angle measurements. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of several factors on monomer conversion were studied, such as reaction time, reaction temperature, composition of the monomer feed (MAn/CHDDVE) and initiator concentration. Molecular weight and its polydispersity and polymer material morphology were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) technologies, respectively. It was demonstrated that CTC was formed in MAn/CHDDVE system, based on ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) analysis. The product was alternating copolymer with high crosslinking degree, so it could not be dissolved in common solvents, e.g. water, chloroform, N, N-dimethyl formamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF) and acetone (Ac).

Effects of reaction time and quantity of BPO on the polymerization were investigated. With the prolongation of reaction time, the graft polymerization took place rapidly at first, then slowed down, and leveled off. With the increase of BPO, the graft yield increased, then remained unchanged, and lastly began to decrease. The surface topography structure of the grafted PET film was observed by SEM.

ATR-FITR spectra proved the occurrence of grafting polymerization of LiAA on the substrate. Gravimetric analysis was performed to investigate the influences of some important factors on the photografting polymerization of LiAA. SEM was utilized to investigate the topography of the grafted film. The experimental results indicated that elongation of the irradiation time could increase the grafting yield (Yg) and Yg performed a maximum at a certain concentration of LiAA.

33745954010	A novel method for functionalization of polypropylene with oligomer of glycidyl methacrylate: Characterization of copolymers	A novel approach to functionalize polypropylene (PP) is presented. This method consists of two steps. Firstly, oligomers of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) were synthesized via UV photo-polymerization using benzophenone (BP) as initiator. Secondly, the GMA oligomers were grafted onto PP, which was initiated by the free radicals generated through the reactivation of semipinacol dormant groups in the oligomers. By this method, the functionalization of PP could be facilely achieved in a simple system without either organic peroxide initiator or monomer; additionally, degradation of the substrate PP was not observed. This presentation is mainly focused on the characterization of the grafted PP products by XRD, DSC and TGA measurements. It is demonstrated that the melting temperature, crystallinity and the initial decomposition temperature of the grafted PP were all increased, compared with those of the origin PP; the functionalization of PP led to the change of the crystal form from the mixed form of α and β into only α form.

33749166253	Studies on photografting of trimethylol propane triacrylate onto the surface of LDPE films	Photografting (λ > 300 nm) of trimethylol propane triacrylate (TMPTA) onto the surface of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films was investigated at room temperature in a mixed solvent composed of acetone and water, using benzophenone (BP) as an initiator. It seems that the polyfunctional monomer could be grafted easily onto the surface, forming a cross-linked structure, and as confirmed by IR spectroscopy there were still some double bonds un-reacted. Influences on the photografting of TMPTA were examined and the experimental results indicated that longer irradiation time and higher monomer concentration were useful for the increase of grafted polymer conversion. At a certain concentration of BP, a maximum grafted polymer conversion was obtained, and the decrease of grafted conversion at higher BP concentrations was probably due to the absorption effect of initiator. The increase of grafted polymer conversion was observed with increasing the water contents. SEM images showed that a lot of small particles appeared on the surface of grafted films, and water contact angle measurements noted that the surface hydrophobicity was improved.

Batch liquid-phase process by one-step method	In this article, a batch liquid-phase process was reported, by which the photo-initiated grafting polymerization could be carried out on the dark surfaces that were not directly irradiated by UV light. In the reaction system, an aluminum foil was placed horizontally to reflect UV light back and form a dark area underneath where the grafting polymerization took place. The occurrence of the polymerization was demonstrated by gravitational analyses and XPS spectra. The factors affecting the grafting reaction have been studied and the results showed that increasing irradiation time, reaction temperature, and benzophenone concentration and decreasing distance (D) between the light area and the place where grafting reaction took place were beneficial to the grafting reaction. The highest grafting density was obtained at a acrylic acid concentration of 15 vol %. Moreover, some further investigations were also made. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33846370571	A new vapor/solid polymerization system initiated by UV light	A new apparatus for carrying out vapor/solid polymerization initiated by UV light has been designed. The system relies on monomer photolysis and the benzophenone/triethanolamine system to initiate polymerization of vinyl acetate to afford poly (vinyl acetate) on the surface of biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) film and glass respectively. The poly (vinyl acetate) formed on the surface of the BOPP film was shown to be partly crosslinked (up to 46%), while that formed on the surface of the glass could all pass through a 200 mesh metal filter (0.071 mm). The values of the polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were 6.0 and 4.0 respectively. In the case of both BOPP and glass substrates, the mass/thickness of the polymer and its molecular weight increased with reaction time. Increasing the temperature gave an increase in the molecular weight of the polymer formed on the BOPP film but not of that on glass. Mechanisms for the formation of polymer on BOPP film and glass substrates are proposed. Furthermore, after modification of the reaction apparatus, the degree of crosslinking of the polymer formed on the BOPP film was higher than 95% and while the mass of polymer formed on the surface of glass decreased significantly, it could still all pass through the 200 mesh (0.071 mm) metal filter.

After each step of reaction, the PP film surface was characterized by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Static water contact angles of the PP, PP-g-PAA, and PP-g-PAA/PANI films were measured, and the results revealed that graft reactions took place as expected. The morphology of the PP-g-PAA film and the PP-g-PAA/PANI composite film were observed by atomic force microscopy. The conductivity and the thickness of the PP-g-PAA/PANI composite films with 1.5 wt % PANI were around 0.21 S/cm and 0.4 μm, respectively.

The results show that a photografting of NVP aqueous solution on the BOPP films produced a morphology of cloudlike grafted layer. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) studies reveal that the surface grafted particles are closely assembled by a number of primary particles. The results also show that the poly N-Vinylpyrrolidone (PVP) chains with propagating radicals rearrange into micelles due to their affinity to the used cationic surfactant. The durable propagating radicals move to the interfaces of the micelles and initiate the polymerization of the NVP monomers.

33847750283	Covalently attached graft polymer monolayer on organic polymeric substrate via confined surface inhibition reaction	A grafting technique was proposed for the preparation of polymer monolayer on polymeric substrate. On the basis of our recent work on polymer-supported inhibitor (PSI), hydroquinone (HQ) was first implanted onto polypropylene (PP) surface through UV-initiated grafting. The resulting immobilized HQ was used as PSI for the thermal-induced free radical polymerization (FRP) of acrylic acid (AA). The inhibition mechanism was similar to that of free HQ molecule, that is, polymer chain-carrying radical or peroxy radical could be deactivated by abstracting hydrogen atom from hydroxyl group of immobilized HQ, and the resulting oxyradical (semiquinone radical) combined with another active chain free radical. According to this mechanism, a devised redox initiator consisting of sodium hydrogen sulfite and ammonium persulfate was used to initiate FRP of AA in water at low temperature (50°C). High crystal-line biaxial oriented PP film with HQ immobilized was deliberately laid in this system as a radical trap to capture poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) short chain radical.

Monomer conversion, grafting efficiency, and grafting yields were determined by the gravimetric method. ATR-IR, AFM, and TEM were used to characterize the surface composition, to observe the topography of the grafted substrates, and to view inter-film colloid particles formed by cross-linking. The results reveal that, with the opaque MMA/DVB emulsion system and CPP film as substrate, the monomer conversion is in the range of 15-55%, the grafting efficiency is about 80%, the grafting yield reaches 5%, and the thickness of the graft layer can be controlled in the range 0.09- 1.5 μm. Images of AFM show that the graft layer is pilled up by nanoparticles (about 30-50 nm in diameter), which are linked together and tied to the substrate surface with covalent bonds. A possible model of surface graft polymerization including surface initiating, nucleation, and shish kebab growing is put forward to interpreting the above results.

Proved by ATR-IR, highly crosslinked grafted layer was generated rapidly under UV irradiation. Effects on percent conversion of grafting are detailed with, such as feed ratio of BP to TMPTA, mass percent of TMPTA in the reaction system, mass percent of water in the mixed solvents and addition of the second monomer, methyl methacrylate (MMA). As both verified by SEM and AFM, relatively planar grafted layer was produced when photografting was carried out merely in THF; adding water in the reaction system caused the formation of "craters" in the grafted layer. In addition, effects of mass percent of water in the mixed solvents, UV irradiation time, TMPTA concentration and addition of MMA on the size, shape and quantity of the "craters" were investigated by SEM. A plausible mechanism for the formation of "craters" is also proposed. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

These monomers were polymerized with Rh-catalyst in high yields (nearly 100%), and the obtained polymers demonstrated high steroregularity.

The different pendent groups in the polymers' side chains placed different effects on the stability of the helices adopted by the corresponding polymers. It was concluded that the pendent groups affected largely both the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the neighboring amide groups and the rigidity of the polymer main chains. These two factors are exceptionally important for poly(N-paropargylamides) to take the configuration of stable helices.

As the first step, UV photoreduction followed by cross-linking/coupling reactions with benzophenone (BP) as the photoinitiator and trimethylpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) as the accelerator were carried out in order to attach dormant semi-pinacol groups to the surface of the NBR particles (NBR-SP). The second step, carried out under heating, involved the grafting of styrene (St) which was induced from the particle surface by bond breaking of NBR-SP and propagation towards the center of the particles. The grafting efficiency could be kept at a high level, i.e. approx. 90%, and the grafting yield increased with time (could reach up to 140%). Finally, by adding acrylamide (AM) or N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) as a second monomer under heating, a composite core-shell particle could be prepared. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

36448961189	A novel strategy for the preparation of reactively compatibilized polymer blends with oligomers containing α-methyl styrene units	A novel strategy to prepare reactively compatibilized polymer blends is reported. An oligomer that consists of AMS (α-methyl styrene) and GMA (glycidyl methacrylate) is initially synthesized. When this oligomer is melt blended with poly(propylene) (PP), the GMA units in the oligomer are successfully grafted onto the PP chain, which is proven by measuring the FT-IR spectrum of the blended PP. When the oligomer is added to a blend of PP/Ny66, an in-situ compatibilization occurs, which leads to an increase in torque values during blending, a decrease in crystallinity degree of Ny66, and is observed by SEM images of the resulting blends. The compatibilizing effects of the oligomer are also observed in PP/Ny6 and polyethylene/Ny6 blends. A relevant compatibilization mechanism is proposed. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

37749043016	Effects of pendent groups on optical activity of helical N-propargylamide copolymers	5 Series of chiral-achiral N-propargylamide copolymers were synthesized, providing copolymers with moderate number-average molecular weights in high yields. For the copolymers from the achiral monomers with appropriate bulky pendent groups, the moderate steric hindrance between the pendent groups enabled the copolymer main chains to adopt helices preferring the same handed screw sense taken by the chiral units; the corresponding copolymers exhibited higher CD signal intensity even when compared with the pure chiral polymer. However, for the achiral co-monomers with too small or too large pendent groups, they were unfavorable for the resulting copolymers to prefer the helical handedness adopted by the chiral units, leading to low CD signal intensity. These findings would be helpful for us to design and synthesize novel helical N-propargylamide poly- and copolymers with high optical activity.

Structural analysis by 1D/2D NMR showed that the hydroxyl groups of the semibenzopinacol moieties after hydrogen abstraction reaction have reacted directly to form a new ether structure instead of the cleavage of a C-C bond in a photopolymerization system featured constant intensity of absorbed light when there is only vinyl acetate added. In order to clarify this new reaction, comparative experiments and several characterization methods were applied. Results revealed that poly(vinyl acetate) radicals initiated by UV irradiation or benzophenone/triethanolamine system, and UV irradiation under or above 300 nm, were two necessary factors for the formation of the new ether structure from hydroxyl groups of semibenzopinacol moieties. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The strategy involved two main steps, i.e., a grafting polymerization of acrylate acid (AA) onto the surface of a polypropylene (PP) film and subsequently an oxidative polymerization of aniline on the grafted surface. By tuning the conformation of the surface-grafted poly acrylate acid (PAA) brushes, as well as the ratio of AA to aniline, the shape of the PANIs fixated onto the surfaces of the polymer substrate could be controlled to go from spherical particles to nanowires and eventually to nanoribbons. In these structures, the PAA brushes not only acted as templates but also as dopants of PANI, and thereby, the nanostructured PANIs could be strongly bonded with the substrate. In addition, the surface of the PP films grafted with polyaniline nanowires and nanoribbons displayed superhydrophobicity with contact angles for water of approxiamtely 145 and 151°, respectively. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

This review surveys the recent advances in UV light induced surface graft polymerizations, predominantly focusing on: (1) various initiating methods, controlled/living grafting, self-initiated grafting (grafting without the addition of photoinitiators), graft polymerizations with monomer pairs able to form charge transfer (CT) complexes, grafting in liquid, vapor and bulk phase, and the substrates used for grafting; (2) the topography of grafted surface layers, including granular structure, crosslinked structure, and well-defined structure; and (3) the application of techniques to prepare functionalized polymer surfaces with designed performances, e.g., to obtain polymer materials suitable for biomedical applications, membranes or microfluidics. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

58049113467	Photo-induced polymerization of methyl methacrylate/cyclodextrin complex in aqueous solution	Polymerization of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) complex of methyl methacrylate (MMA) (MMA/HP-β-CD) was carried out under UV irradiation in aqueous solution with Irgacure 2959 (4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl-(2-hydroxy-2-propyl)ketone) as a photoinitiator at room temperature. The effects of some principal factors, including UV irradiation intensity, initiator concentration, and the ratio of HP-β-CD to MMA, on the polymerization were investigated in detail. Compared to the corresponding thermal polymerization, photo-induced polymerization of the MMA/HP-β-CD complex could be accomplished at a higher speed; the polymerization conversion in photo-induced polymerization reached 94% within 30 min, while it was only 62% for the thermal polymerization of 16 hr at 70°C.

84867036857	Surface photografting of functional monomers initiated by fluorenone on ldpe films	Vio the process of photografting surface modification by UV light, fluorenone (FL) was employed as an initiator in the grafting reaction of acrylic acid ( AA ) , acryamide ( AM ) , methylacrylic acid ( MAA ) , methyl acrylate (MA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) onto the surface of LDPE films for introducing new chemical properties to the film surface. In this study, influences of the initiator concentration, UV light irradiation time,UV light irradiation intensity as well as the types of functional monomers on the grafting yield of LDPE films were investigated respectively. Within a certain range, the results showed that raising the fluorenone concentration would lead to the increasing of the grafting yield, however, when the fluorenone concentration reached 5% , the grafting yield decreased. The grafting polymerization was fully promoted by increasing the light irradiation intensity up to 100 W/m and prolonging the UV light irradiation time to 4 min. Grafting ability of different types of monomers on LDPE films was concerned with parameters such as activity of monomers, compatibility of monomers with the matrix and so on. After successful grafting of functional monomers,the changes of water contact angle of the grafted LDPE film were related to the grafting yield of monomer on the film as well as the hydrophilicity of the applied monomers.

84877780106	Creating "living" polymer surfaces to pattern biomolecules and cells on common plastics	Creating patterns of biomolecules and cells has been applied widely in many fields associated with the life sciences, including diagnostics. In these applications it has become increasingly apparent that the spatiotemporal arrangement of biological molecules in vitro is important for the investigation of the cellular functions found in vivo. However, the cell patterning techniques often used are limited to creating 2D functional surfaces on glass and silicon. In addition, in general, these procedures are not easy to implement in conventional biological laboratories. Here, we show the formation of a living poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layer that can be patterned with visible light on plastic surfaces. This new and simple method can be expanded to pattern multiple types of biomolecule on either a previously formed PEG layer or a plastic substrate. Using common plastic wares (i.e., polyethylene films and polystyrene cell culture Petri-dishes), we demonstrate that these PEG-modified surfaces have a high resistance to protein adsorption and cell adhesion, while at the same time, being capable of undergoing further molecular grafting with bioactive motifs. With a photomask and a fluid delivery system, we illustrate a flexible way to immobilize biological functions with a high degree of 2D and 3D spatial control. We anticipate that our method can be easily implemented in a typical life science laboratory (without the need for specialized lithography equipment) offering the prospect of imparting desirable properties to plastic products, for example, the creation of functional microenvironments in biological studies or reducing biological adhesion to surfaces. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84896997295	Hydroxylation of organic polymer surface: Method and application	It may be hardly believable that inert C-H bonds on a polymeric material surface could be quickly and efficiently transformed into C-OH by a simple and mild way. Thanks to the approaches developed recently, it is now possible to transform surface H atoms of a polymeric substrate into monolayer OH groups by a simple/mild photochemical reaction. Herein the method and application of this small-molecular interfacial chemistry is highlighted. The existence of hydroxyl groups on material surfaces not only determines the physical and chemical properties of materials but also provides effective reaction sites for postsynthetic sequential modification to fulfill the requirements of various applications. However, organic synthetic materials based on petroleum, especially polyolefins comprise mainly C and H atoms and thus present serious surface problems due to low surface energy and inertness in reactivity. These limitations make it challenging to perform postsynthetic surface sequential chemical derivatization toward enhanced functionalities and properties and also cause serious interfacial problems when bonding or integrating polymer substrates with natural or inorganic materials. Polymer surface hydroxylation based on direct conversion of C-H bonds on polymer surfaces is thus of significant importance for academic and practical industrial applications. Although highly active research results have reported on small-molecular C-H bond activation in solution (thus homogeneous), most of them, featuring the use of a variety of transition metals as catalysts, present a slow reaction rate, a low atom economy and an obvious environmental pollution. In sharp contrast to these conventional C-H activation strategies, the present Spotlight describes a universal confined photocatalytic oxidation (CPO) system that is able to directly convert polymer surface C-H bonds to C-OSO

84897641820	Multiple levels hydrophobic modification of polymeric substrates by UV-grafting polymerization with TFEMA as monomer	The hydrophobic solid surface modification with fluorine-containing monomers has received tremendous attention because of its unique structure and excellent property. However, these hydrophobic films normally suffer from two major problems: one is weak interface interaction between fluoropolymers and substrates, and the other is the high cost of fluorine-containing monomers. Herein, with the aim of feasible industrial application, a facile in situ UV photo-grafting method is reported, which could ensure the formation of chemical bonds between fluoropolymer-grafted layer and substrate with a low cost commercial 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA) as monomer. With low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film as a model substrate, four kinds of poly-TFEMA-grafted layer are fabricated on LDPE films with different surface morphologies: polymer brush, polymer network, crosslinked nanoparticles, and a micro- and nanoscale hierarchical structure. The experimental results showed that the water contact angles (CAs) of the LDPE films grafted with polymer brush, polymer network, and crosslinked nanoparticles were (103 ± 2)°, (95 ± 2)°, and (122 ± 2)°, respectively, which were much higher than that of LDPE film. The introduction of micro- and nanoscale hierarchical structures can dramatically improve the surface roughness, which will further enhance the film hydrophobicity, and the water CA can reach as high as (140 ± 1)°. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem. 2014, 52, 1059-1067 To prepare a micro- and nanoscale hierarchical structure onto the low-density polyethylene surface, a two-step photo-grafting procedure is devised. The introduction of micro- and nanoscale hierarchical structures can dramatically improve the surface roughness, which enhances the film hydrophobicity, and the water contact angle can reach as high as (140 ± 1°), which is superior to that of micropatterned films grafted with polymer brushes (128 ± 2°).

84925503566	Facile synthesis of core-shell, multiple compartment anisotropic particles via control of cross-linking and continuous phase separations in one-pot dispersion polymerization	Preparation of anisotropic particles based on phase separation of prefabricated seeds in polymerizations generally involves multiple process steps. In conventional one-pot dispersion polymerization, only spherical particles are produced. Herein, anisotropic particles with asymmetrical core-shell structure, multiple compartments, and continuously tunable surface roughness and sizes were synthesized by a modified one-pot dispersion polymerization. A mixture of polar solvents, ethylene glycol (EG), and water (6/4, vol.) was used as medium for polymerization of styrene (St). In the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS) and vinyl acetate (VA), divinylbenzene (DVB, 16.1–66.4 %) and (St, 50.3–0 %) were added at 60, 180, and 360 min, respectively. Dense cross-linking was confined to exterior of swollen growing particles, resulting in phase separation and formation of snowman-like particles with coarse, core-shell structured body, and smooth, no or partially cross-linked head. The newly formed compartments were also inhomogeneously cross-linked and their phases separated, producing three and four compartment anisotropic particles with an aspect ratio up to 2.3. Gel content of final particles was less than 75 %. Due to a sequential cross-linking from growing particle to newly formed compartments, reaction stability and particle monodispersity were maintained even when high amounts of DVB were added. Asymmetrical morphologies, structures, sizes, and surface roughness of particles were continuously tuned by varying DVB amount and its start addition time. This one-pot method provides a simple, efficient route for synthesis of anisotropic particles.

43049106467	High efficient grafting polymerization of styrene on surface of NBR latex and physical properties of NBR/NBR-g-PSt composite	The grafting polymerization of styrene on the surface of commercial available vulcanized acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) latex was initiated by the heat decomposing cleavage of dormant groups of semipinacol (SP) immobilized firstly under UV irradiation. Extremely high grafting efficiency in the range from about 90% to nearly 100% could be achieved. Certain factors affinitive to the grafting polymerization, such as the concentration of monomer, the UV irradiation time taking on the immobilization of SP groups, and concentration of NBR latex containing SP groups, were investigated. It was noted that there was the highest conversion when the weight ratio of NBR and St was 4:6; the grafting polymerization had a constant grafting efficiency that was almost not affected by polymerization time and the ratio of NBR-SP/St. Furthermore, the morphologies of the thermal compression molded composites of NBR/NBR-g-PSt were observed by TEM and the thermal properties as well as tensile behaviors were examined. Obviously rubber-plastic transition could be displayed with the increasing of grafting yield. When the grafting yield was controlled at about 50%, the strength of modified rubbers increased significantly without losing its elongation. © 2008 The Society of Polymer Science.

4344579364	Synthesis and inhibition performance of a polymer-supported inhibitor	The synthesis of a polymer-supported inhibitor (PSI) and its inhibition performance for free-radical polymerization are reported for the first time. A special method has been devised to synthesize PSI with pure and abundant hydroquinone (HQ) groups anchored onto the polymer surface. A thin HQ/acetone (AC) solution is sandwiched between two polymer films. Under ultraviolet irradiation, AC as an photoinitiator quickly and effectively grafts HQ onto the polymer surface. PSI has been characterized with ultraviolet-visible and attenuated total reflectance/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. For potential applications, PSI has been used to inhibit the thermal polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate, The corresponding inhibition performance has been investigated through the measurement of the induction period with the dilatometer method. With the same absolute amount, the maximum inhibition ability of PSI approaches half that of a free inhibitor. Increasing the dispersion degree of PSI is favorable for the enhancement of the inhibition ability. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In short irradiation time (4 min) and at room temperature, high grafting efficiency (approaching 100%) and remarkable graft polymer amount (grafting percent is about 4.6%) was obtained. The possible reaction mechanism was based on the photosensittvity of DMF, which induced this photografting polymerization. This finding is useful to develop photoinitiator-free grafting or photopolymerization system. Using SEM, special discrete globular structure was found on the MMA-grafted LDPE film surface, and a possible model was proposed to interpret it.

45449101181	A novel type of optically active helical polymers: Synthesis and characterization of poly(N-propargylureas)	This article presents two novel artificial helical polymers, substituted polyacetylenes with urea groups in side chains. Poly(4) and poly(5) can be obtained in high yields (≥97%) and with moderate molecular weights (11,000-14,000). Poly(4) contains chiral centers in side chains, and poly(5) is an achiral polymer. Both of the two polymers adopted helical structures under certain conditions. More interestingly, poly(4) exhibited large specific optical rotations, resulting from the predominant one-handed screw sense. The helical conformation in poly(5) was stable against heat, while poly(4) underwent conformational transition from helix to random coil upon increasing temperature from 0 to 55°C. Solvents had considerable influence on the stability of the helical conformation in poly(4). The screw sense adopted by the helices was also largely affected by the nature of the solvent. Poly(4-co-5)s formed helical conformation and showed large optical rotations, following the Sergeants and Soldiers rule. By comparing the present two polymers (with one -N-H groups) with the three polymers previously reported (with two -N-H groups in side chains), the nature of the hydrogen bonds formed between the neighboring urea groups played big roles in the formation of stable helical conformation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

52649177357	Positive and negative ZnO micropatterning on functionalized polymer surfaces	Patterned ZnO deposition on substrates has received increasing attention because of its great potential in photocatalysis, energy conversion, and electro-optical techniques. Chemical solution growth is especially promising for organic substrates due to its very mild reaction conditions. Here this method is used on functionality-patterned polymer surfaces in order to fabricate positive and negative ZnO micropatterns. A ZnO film made of arrayed rods, typically 500-750 nm in diameter and 2.5 μm in length, is selectively obtained on sulfated and hydroxylated regions of biaxially oriented poly(propylene), giving rise to positive patterns. For reactive polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), the ZnO rods selectively remain on the unmodified original regions, creating negative patterns. Unlike complex photolithography procedures, the irradiation and patterning processes do not require the use of positive or negative photoresists, and possible damage from acidic solutions on the underlying substrate during the chemical etching process is avoided. The process thus proves to be a simple, creditable, and low-cost method, which could be easily applied on a variety of inert and reactive polymer surfaces. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

53349096036	Precipitation polymerization in acetic acid: Synthesis of monodisperse cross-linked poly(divinylbenzene) microspheres	This paper reports two important results with cross-linked precipitation polymerization. (1) Acetonitrile, a substance harmful to human health, is the most commonly used solvent for the synthesis of cross-linked polymeric microspheres by precipitation polymerization. Here, the much safer acetic acid replaced acetonitrile as a solvent in the precipitation polymerization of monodisperse cross-linked poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB-55) microspheres. Pumpkin-like particles and microspheres were obtained. XPS results displayed a significant amount of double bonds on the surface of the particles. The effect of monomer content, temperature, and initiator amount on the formed particles were studied. For a DVB loading below 1 vol % at 70°C, monodisperse microspheres with smooth surfaces and narrow diameters were successfully obtained. With a DVB loading of 2 vol % and by observing the shapes of particles obtained with three different temperature(60, 70, and 80°C), we found that more spherical particles were obtained at higher temperatures and pumpkin-like particles were obtained at lower temperatures. No significant differences in morphology or the coefficient of variation (CV) of the particles were obtained for different initiator loadings, whereas the particle diameters could be increased with increased initiator concentrations. (2) In order to obtain a better understanding of the formation mechanism of these particles, time-dependent experiments, for the first time, were conducted in a hydrophobic monomer system. By tracing the whole polymerization process, some important results were found. First, with the polymerization time at 70°C, the particle diameters were found to increase from 800 nm to 3.0 μm, the CV displayed a decrease, and the amount of spheres and the spherical evenness of the particle surfaces improved. Second, by quantitatively calculating the particle number from the yields and diameters data, it is found that starting from 3.1% yield or two hours reaction time the total amount of particles in the system is almost a constant (about 9.6 × 10

The entire polymerization could be performed within 1-2 h and display a conversion higher than 90%. The particle sizes could be tuned in the range of 20-40 nm. The formation mechanism for these of nano-sized latex particles was attributed to an in situ formation of PS chains with terminal hydroxyl groups.

65249165499	Precipitation polymerization in acetic acid: Study of the solvent effect on the morphology of poly(divinylbenzene)	This paper reports on two important results regarding the precipitation polymerization of poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB) in acetic acid (HAc). (1) Acetic acid is a novel kind of solvent worthy of investigation because it is amphipathic and innoxious. Thus, two kinds of model solvents, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and n-heptane, were selected to investigate the solvent effect on the particle morphology of PDVB-55 during precipitation polymerization in acetic acid. Monodisperse PDVB-55 microspheres were obtained with an MEK content of 30 vol % and a DVB loading of 2 vol %. Odd-shaped particles were found to almost disappear when MEK was added. For MEK contents up to 90 vol %, space-filling macrogels consisting of small particles with diameters of around 10 nm were obtained. More homocoagulated particles were produced when n-heptane was added, for which concentrations up to 50 vol % gave rise to cauliflower-like particles. Thus, in the acetic acid system, microspheres, pumpkin-like particles, macrogels, and coagulum could be successfully obtained.

Three types of substituted acetylenes-one achiral N-propargylamide, two chiral N-propargylsulfamides, and chiral A-propaygylurea- were polymerized in the presence of hydrophobic Rh-based catalyst and with SDS as emulsifier and DMF as coemulsifier. Such microemulsion polymerizations led to nanoscale particles (70-110 nm in diameter) of polymers adopting helical conformations. The particles derived from the chiral monomers showed large specific rotations and intense circular dichroism (CD) signals. The obtained polymer dispersions demonstrated high stability. The thus-prepared polymers after removing the emulsifier and coemulsifier showed much stronger CD signals, and the helices were found to have higher thermal stability when compared with the corresponding polymers synthesized via catalytic polymerizations in organic solvents. The microemulsion polymerizations enable the polymers to form predominantly one-handed helical structures. The possible mechanisms were proposed for the formation of optically active polymer particles, for the formation of predominantly one-handed helices, and for the increased thermal stability of the helices formed in the polymers. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

The content of incorporation of the reduced ITX groups in the precursor was estimated by UV-vis spectrum analysis and the results indicated that it was greatly influenced by the ITX concentration in system. The presence of EDAB could promote the polymerization and result in high monomer conversions and low molecular weight of polymers with wide distributions, but had no evident effect on the incorporation of reduced ITX moieties in polymer. Furthermore, more monomer supplied in system was advantageous for the production of high molecular weight of polymers and provided apparently low content of reduced ITX residues in polymer. Using a selected precursor of PMMA-ITXH with a moderate level of reduced ITX residues, molecular weight and its distribution, the bulk polymerization of St was initiated. FTIR spectrum analysis and GPC measurement confirmed the formation of block copolymer of PMMA-b-PSt. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Herein, well-defined comb-shaped cationic copolymers (HPDs) composed of long biocompatible hydroxypropyl cellulose (or HPC) backbones and short poly((2-dimethyl amino)ethyl methacrylate) (or P(DMAEMA)) side chains were prepared as gene vectors via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from the bromoisobutyryl-terminated HPC biopolymers. The P(DMAEMA) side chains of HPDs can be further partially quaternized to produce the quaternary ammonium HPDs (QHPDs). HPDs and QHPDs were assessed in vitro for nonviral gene delivery. HPDs exhibit much lower cytotoxicity and better gene transfection yield than high-molecular-weight P(DMAEMA) homopolymers. QHPDs exhibit a stronger ability to complex pDNA, due to increased surface cationic charges. Thus, the approach to well-defined comb-shaped cationic copolymers provides a versatile means for tailoring the functional structure of nonviral gene vectors to meet the requirements of strong DNA-condensing ability and high transfection capability. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

70349200748	The initiation of a macroinitiator	The initiation of a novel macroinitiator is presented. The oligomers of α-methyl styrene (AMS) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) (designated as PAG) were used as macroinitiator in the bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and styrene (St).The polymerization of MMA was carried out at 90°C and that of St at 100°C, respectively. The resulting copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The results indicated that the copolymers can be prepared by simply heating PAG in the presence of the second monomer, without any other initiator. During the process of polymerization of MMA, the higher AMS content in PAG led to higher monomer conversion, which suggested that the polymerization reaction was initiated by PAG. Under the certain reaction time, copolymers can be obtained from the reaction system of St and PAG, but there had nothing in the system of pure St. Also, the copolymers gained by polymerization of MMA initiated with PAG have the reinitiating reactivity, and the curve of molecular weight with reaction time (M

72449184573	Visible light-induced living surface grafting polymerization for the potential biological applications	A novel visible light-induced living surface grafting polymerization was developed by a strategy in which isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) was first photoreduced under UV light and sequentially coupled onto the surface of polymeric substrates, and the produced isopropyl thioxanthone-semipinacol (ITXSP) "dormant" groups were subsequently reactivated under visible light to initiate a surface grafting polymerization. By using glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and low-density polyethylene(LDPE) films as models, a "living" surface grafting polymerization initiated by ITXSP under visible light at room temperature was observed. Both the surface grafting chain length versus grafting conversion of monomer and the grafting polymerization rate versus monomer concentration demonstrated a linear dependence, which is in accord with the known characteristics of living polymerization. The livingness rendered it possible to accurately control the thickness of the grafted layer by simply altering the irradiation time. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

71949094417	The mechanism of PVA-activated modification of maleic anhydride copolymers	Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been used as a modifier to improve the properties of maleic anhydride copolymers under mild conditions, and the mechanism involved is discussed. When a solution of PVA in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was dropped into a solution of maleic anhydride/vinyl acetate copolymer (P(MAn/VAc)) in DMSO, the color of the P(MAn/VAc) solution turned immediately from light violet to purple. UV-visible spectroscopy showed a strong absorbance in the range 400-650nm, indicating that a tetrahedral zwitterion structure is formed between hydroxyl groups of PVA and anhydride groups of P(MAn/VAc). No such color change or UV-visible absorbance change was observed for a solution of a maleic anhydride/styrene copolymer (P(MAn/St)) when PVA was added, suggesting that in this case the tetrahedral zwitterion structure is unstable and the anhydride group opens directly to produce bulk hydrogel. UV irradiation promoted the transformation of the tetrahedral zwitterion structure to the electrically neutral isomer, and thus accelerated the ring opening of the anhydride group.

The catalyzed chain extension of these prepolymers was carried out at 180-220°C with 2,2′ -(1,4-phenylene)-bis(2-oxazoline) as a chain extender and p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) as a catalyst. Higher molecular weight polyesters were obtained from the catalyzed chain extension than from the noncatalyzed one. However, an improperly high amount of p-TSA and a high temperature caused branching or a crosslinking reaction. Under optimal conditions, chain-extended poly (butylene adipate) (PBA) with a number-average molecular weight up to 29,600 and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) with an intrinsic viscosity of 0.82 dL/g were synthesized.

75749117928	Preparation of soft hydrogel nanoparticles with pnipam hair and characterization of their temperature-induced aggregation	There exists a great number of publications concerning the synthesis of core-shell and/or hairy particles by means of controlled/living polymerization. Nevertheless, how to fabricate ultrafine nanosized hairy particles, especially polymeric soft hairy particles, remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a simple self-developed approach consisting of a two-step photoinduced polymerization of cross-linked Polyacrylamide (CLPAM) soft hydrogel nanoparticles (5-10 nm in diameter) grafted with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) chains. The architecture of such ultrafine soft waterswollen CLPAM@PNIPA.m core/shell nanoparticles (20-35 nm in diameter) demonstrated very specific temperature sensitive behaviors. During heating a fast association process was observed, at approximately 33-34 °C and. the singular hairy particles with 34 nm diameters clustered into aggregates that were ∼120 nm in diameter. Raising the temperature further, however, led to a decrease in size to about 100 nm at 45 °C. This behavior was attributed to the formation of hydrophobic shell layers accompanying the shrinkage of PNIPAm chains with chain polar transformations. With the contraction pressure produced by further shrinkage of the hydrophobic shell layers, the soft fully swollen PAM cores expelled water and diminished in size, During the cooling process, these contracted cores that were trapped in the aggregates gave rise to an early dissociation. The hydrophilic hairy CLPAM@PNIPAm particles are believed to be potentially useful as carriers to specific target regions, e.g., cells for controlled drug delivery and other smart biomaterial applications. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77649146777	Thermally on-off switching membranes prepared by pore-filling poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels	Pore-filling N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAM) polymer hydrogels were successfully grafted onto track-etched polycarbonate (PC) membranes by plasma-induced graft copolymerization. The microstructure and morphology of the PC-g-PNIPAAM membranes were investigated by XPS, SEM, ATR-FTIR, TGA, and water flux experiments. The effective pore sizes were regulated by the volume change of the cross-linked PNIPAAM hydrogels in the temperature range around its lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The PC-g-PNIPAAM membranes demonstrated a fast and reversible valve switching mechanism in a small temperature range. The on-off water flux ratio became more significant with the increase of the monomer concentration. Contact angle results showed that the thermal-responsive gating characteristics of PC-g-PNIPAAM membranes were mainly dependent on the pore size change. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

75849142579	Study of surface oxidation of carbon black and its water dispersion	A simple and environmentally friendly method for the oxidization of carbon black in water, using ammonium persulfate (APS) as an oxidant, has been proposed. The parameters affecting the dispersity and stability of carbon black samples were studied systematically. The functional groups present on the surface of carbon black samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and pH value measurement. The dispersity was examined by determining the degree of retention of carbon black on filter paper and the stability was examined by measuring the absorbance of the decantate after separation by centrifugation. Furthermore, the particle size of oxidized carbon black was measured with a laser light scattering system and the morphology of the particles was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results indicated that the optimum oxidation conditions are an APS content of 0.018%, an oxidation temperature of 30°C and an oxidation time of 20h; under these conditions, the modal particle size of the carbon black decreased from 315.6nm to 146.8nm.

The polymerization was initiated by the reversible coupling-fragmentation of ITX residues. Conventional emulsion polymerization of styrene (St) was initiated by poly(methyl methacrylate)-ITXH (PMMA-ITXH), and the soap-free emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) was initiated by maleic anhydride/vinyl acetate copolymer-ITXH (PMV-ITXH). The polymer weights, polydispersities and particle morphologies were investigated. The results showed that the macroinitiators containing ITX residues can initiate the emulsion polymerization of St and MMA. The emulsion polymerization exhibited fast polymerization rates and gave high molecular weights whilst the soap-free emulsion produced stable particles with even particle sizes.

77749280075	Hollow polymer particles with nanoscale pores and reactive groups on their rigid shells: Preparation and application as nanoreactors	A novel type of hollow polymeric particles was prepared according to a strategy consisting of three major steps: the synthesis of template particles (PMV) based on maleic anhydride/vinyl acetate; the formation of core/shell particles by using maleic anhydride/divinylbenzene as comonomers, AIBN as initiator, and PMV as templates; and the removal of the core by dissolving it with an organic solvent. This route gave rise to core/shell and hollow particles in high yields, and the as-prepared particles possessed obvious advantages. The size of the core and the thickness of the shell were controllable by adjusting the reaction conditions. The shells were of high rigidity and strength as a result of the high cross-linking degree. The surface anhydride groups offered a platform for various postfunctionalization reactions of the particles. The nanoscale pores in the shells enabled an encapsulation of target compounds. The as-prepared hollow particles could be applied as "nanoreactors". To attest to this concept,Ag-encapsulated composite particles were further prepared via redox reactions between NaBH

Such nanoparticles were prepared via aqueous catalytic miniemulsion polymerization, by which nanoparticles with a wide range of size (diameter: 60-400 nm) can be easily prepared. The nanoparticles could be obtained in quantitative monomer conversions. Large specific rotations and intense circular dichroism effects demonstrated that the nanoparticles possessed large optical activities; moreover, the optical activities were found to increase with a decrease in particle size.

77949634819	Hollow polymeric microspheres grafted with optically active helical polymer chains: Preparation and their chiral recognition ability	A novel class of hollow polymeric microspheres was prepared from optically active helical polymers. To prepare the hollow spheres, optically active helical N-propargylamide copolymers (OAHPs) containing specially designed CC groups in pendent groups, were first synthesized and subsequently used as a macromonomer. Polymeric particles based on maleic anhydride (MAH) and vinyl acetate were prepared and used as sacrificial templates for the subsequent preparation of core/shell spheres, which were accomplished by using the system consisting of MAH, divinyl benzene and OAHP macromonomers. After extracting the core in the prepared core/shell particles, hollow microspheres grafted with optically active helical polymer chains were successfully obtained. The hollow particles were characterized with FTIR, field-emission SEM and TEM measurements. The size and the shell thickness of these hollow spheres were readily controllable. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on the hollow spheres dispersed in THF. The intense CD effects indicated that the hollow spheres possessed high optical activity, arising from the helical polymer chains. The preferential adsorption of (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine to the (S)-form by the obtained hollow spheres clearly attested to the chiral recognition ability of the novel spheres. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

77949836900	Comb-shaped conjugates comprising hydroxypropyl cellulose backbones and low-molecular-weight poly(n-isopropylacryamide) side chains for smart hydrogels: Synthesis, characterization, and biomedical applications	Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) possesses a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) above 40 &C, while the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (P(NIPAAm)) exhibits a LCST of about 32 °C. Herein, comb-shaped copolymer conjugates of HPC backbones and low-molecular-weight. P(NIPAAm) side chains (HPC-g-P(NIPAAm) or HPN) were prepared via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from the bromoisobutyryl-functionalized HPC biopolymers. By changing the composition ratio of HPC and P(NIPAAm), the LCSTs of HPNs can be adjusted to be lower than the body temperature. The MTT assay from the HEK293 cell line indicated that HPNs possess reduced cytotoxicity. Some of the hydroxyl groups of HPNs were used as cross-linking sites for the preparation of stable HPN hydrogels. In comparison with the HPC hydrogels, the cross-linked HPN hydrogels possess interconnected pore structures and higher swelling ratios. The in vitro release kinetics of fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled dextran and BSA (or dextran-FITC and BSA-FITC) as model drugs from, the hydrogels showed that the HPN hydrogels are suitable for long-term sustained release of macromolecular drugs at body temperature. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77951618056	Novel category of optically active core/shell nanoparticles: The core consisting of a helical-substituted polyacetylene and the shell consisting of a vinyl polymer	This article reports on a novel methodology for preparing a new class of core/shell nanoparticles. The nanoparticles consist of a unique core (composed of an optically active helical-substituted polyacetylene) and a shell (composed of a vinyl polymer) and thus exhibit optical activities. Such nanoparticles were synthesized by combining aqueous catalytic microemulsion polymerization and free radical polymerization in one specific system. The shells could be further cross-linked for improving the properties of particles. The investigations are of high importance not only in polymer chemistry due to the combination of catalytic polymerization and free radical polymerization in one system but also in materials due to the integration of "chirality" and "nano" concepts in one single material. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

These radicals were generated by photolysis of 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanone under ultraviolet (UV) light. Pristine SWCNTs were dispersed in a tetrahydrofuran solution, and then free radicals were attached to their surface when the solution was subjected to UV irradiation. The functionalization of SWCNTs was evidenced by UV/visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry (TGA-MS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). UV/visible results indicated a loss of Van Hove singularities because of the covalent functionalization. The modification was further proved by FTIR. Raman spectra showed that the intensity ratio of the G band and D band (IG/ID) decreased for the functionalized SWCNTs. TGA-MS also showed a signal corresponding to m/z 59 at 400°C, indicating the presence of 2-propanol-2-yl groups. HRTEM and solubility data proved that the sidewall functionalization dissociated the bundle structure, improved the solubility in common organic solvents and retained the original electronic structure of the SWCNTs without severe modification that damages the nanotubes.

Pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (p-SWCNTs) were dispersed in acetone along with HPHMP photoinitiator.

The oxidized SWNTs showed good solubility in polar solvents including water and DMF. Atomic force microscopic images showed that SWNTs could be cut into short pipes by the highly concentrated APS solution at 80 °C.

78649915654	Preparation of pH-sensitive membranes via dopamine-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization	A facile method to immobilize the initiators onto the substrate is desirable for surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). In this work, a two-step process was first developed for covalent immobilization of ATRP initiators on the outside and inside surfaces of the porous nylon membrane. The nylon membrane was functionalized with poly(dopamine), and the bromoalkyl initiators were then immobilized on the poly(dopamine) functionalized nylon membrane surfaces in a two-step solid-phase reaction, followed by ATRP of acrylic acid (AAc), which was deprotonated by the addition of NaOH in an aqueous solution. The resulting nylon membranes with grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) side chains were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology of the nylon membranes was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicated that the grafted PAAc polymers formed uniformly inside the pores throughout the entire membrane. With the increase of the polymerizing time, the average diameter of the pores became smaller. A kinetics study revealed that the chain growth from the membranes was consistent with a " controlled" process. The nylon-g-PAAc membranes exhibit rapid and reversible responses of the flux to the environmental pH varied from 3 to 8. Between pH 3.5 and 5.5, the membranes demonstrated a pH-valve function as the carboxyl group changed from neutral to charged states with a corresponding variation of chain configuration. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

First, an amino functionalized monomer N-(3-aminopropyl)-p- vinylbenzylimine (CVPD) was synthesized by the displacement reaction of 4-vinylbenzy chloride and 1,3-propane diamine between dichloromethane. Then the nano-latex of styrene and N-(3-aminopropyl)-p-vinylbenzylimine copolymer were synthesized by UV-induced emulsion polymerization with water-soluble 4-(2-hydroxyethoxy) phenyl-(2-hydroxy-2-propyl) ketone (Irgacure 2959) as the photo-initiator and cetyltrimethylammonium bromides (CTAB) as the surfactant. The surfactant amount is only 0.1 wt% ∼0.8 wt% of the total system, much lower than that of mieoemulsion polymerization system which is generally used to synthesize nanoparticles. The diameter and diameter distribution of the P(St-co-CVPD) nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The amino groups of the copolymer were evident from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and the quantity of the amino groups was calculated by ninhydrin reaction. The effects of St/CVPD ratios, initiator concentrations, surfactant concentrations and UV light intensity on the polymerization system were investigated, respectively.

The cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (CTAOH)/p-toluenesulfonic acid (CTAT) wormlike micelle system was selected for both the dispersion of different nanomaterials and the enhancement of viscosities of the coating fluids. With the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)/wormlike micelle aqueous dispersions as coating fluid, TCFs of SWNTs on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) substrates made by rod-coating method were demonstrated. After doping by immersion into thionyl chloride solution, the sheet resistance of SWNTs thin films, which had a transmittance of about 78%, was as low as 480ω/sq. This coating method was extended to the preparation of thin films or networks of other materials such as reduced graphene oxide and Ag nanowires. The obtained TCF from Ag nanowire networks has a low sheet resistance of 17ω/sq, which is comparable to the value of best indium tin oxide (ITO) coating on plastic substrates.

Triplet state acetone abstracts the hydrogen atoms from both the C.H bond of the polymeric film substrate and the O.H bond of phenol which is the building block and the amino group carrier. As a result, two kinds of free radicals, confined carbon-centered chain radicals of the polymer substrate and mobile oxygen-centered phenoxy radicals, were generated. Then the C.O bonds were formed by the coupling reaction between these two kinds of free radicals. p-Tyramine and p-aminophenol were used as amino carriers. The successful introduction of amino groups onto LDPE, BOPP and PET film substrates was demonstrated by measurements of water contract angle (CA), ultraviolet spectra (UV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and fluorescent microscopy. The processing factors, such as the UV-light intensity and irradiation time, concentrations of p-tyramine and p-aminophenol, and the ratio of acetone/water were investigated. The optimized process parameters are as follows: UV light intensity 9500 μ W/cm2; irradiation time 18 min for BOPP and LDPE, 22 min for PET; the ratio of acetone/water = 1; and concentration of p-tyramine and p-aminophenol 15% for BOPP and LDPE, 1% for PET. Based on the UV absorbance, the amino groups on the polymeric substrates were estimated to be in the range of 6.3 × 10

84865863306	Photo-induced living/controlled surface radical grafting polymerization and its application in fabricating 3-D micro-architectures on the surface of flat/particulate organic substrates	This feature article covers the fundamental chemistry and applications of photo-induced living surface grafting polymerization. The mechanism of activation of inert alkyl CeH bonds of polymer substrates, the structures of the active free radical and reversible dormant species, the modes of the grafting chain growth (including linear, branched and cross-linked variants), and the role of spatial effect are discussed. Two technologies, i.e., 1-step and 2-step processes, their features and applications in fabricating polymer brushes with precisely controlled patterns, desired functions, branched and block grafting chains on planar substrates, and polymer lamination are presented. The fabrication of 3-dimensional covalently bonded polymer particles, such as nano-sized polymer particle monolayers (with uniform and bimodal distributions), discrete solid and hollow polymer particles of micrometer size, and multilayer polymer particles on polymeric substrates are also introduced. In the last part, the application of photo-induced living surface grafting polymerization in non-planar surface modifications, such as the preparation of coreeshell polymer particles, Janus particles and cross-linked hydrogels with hairy polymer chains is summarized. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

0036954658	Surface photografting polymerization of binary monomers maleic anhydride and n-butyl vinyl ether on polypropylene film I. Effects of principal factors	Maleic anhydride (MAH) was grafted onto polypropylene (PP) film efficiently by means of introducing the electron donor monomer n-butyl vinyl ether (n-BVE), under UV irradiation. The principal factors affecting surface photografting polymerization such as irradiation time, molar ratio of MAH to BVE, monomer concentration, photoinitiators, UV and solvents, were investigated systematically. The results show that the photografting of MAH/BVE is an effective approach to modify the surface property of the polymeric materials, and the photografting process is very efficient. The contact angle of the grafted surface against water could decrease from 87° to less than 20° within 40 s of the irradiation time. The grafting efficiency would reach the highest when the molar ratio of MAH to BVE was 1:1, which indicated that the formation of charge transfer complex (CTC) between the binary monomers was favorable to the photografting polymerization. Among the photoinitiators benzildimethylketal (BDK), benzophenone (BP) and isopropylthioxanthone (ITX), the sequence of grafting efficiency was BP>ITX>BDK. Far UV (200-300 nm) radiation played a decisive role in the photografting polymerization and high UV intensity could accelerate this process. The solvent with good affinity towards the substrates was favorable to increase the grafting efficiency, because the diffusion of monomer and photoinitiator to the liquid-solid interface could be swimmingly. FT-IR spectra confirmed that both MAH and BVE had been successfully grafted onto PP film.

0038725118	Thermo-sensitive switching membranes regulated by pore-covering polymer brushes	Novel thermo-sensitive switching membrane regulated by pore-covering polymer brushes was prepared by photografting N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) onto the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) track membranes with benzophenone (BP) as initiator. The influence of solvent, initiator concentration and temperature on photografting has been investigated. ATR-FTIR and SEM confirmed that poly-NIPAAm brushes were immobilized on the membranes surface exposed to the UV light instead of inside the pores. The thickness of grafted layer can be adjusted by grafting reaction parameters via grafting degree. The membrane flux is regulated by pore-covering effect that comes from the grafted chains' stretching into the membrane pores. Responding to the change of the temperature, the pore size varied with the swelling and shrinkage of poly-NIPAAm brushes and accordingly adjusted the membranes flux. The 0.2 μm-grafted membranes do not show a remarkable thermo-sensitive valve effect near the range of 30-35°C until the grafting degree exceeds 1%. To 0.4 μm membrane, the grafted brushes are not long enough to cover the membrane pores and thus crosslink agent is necessary. The crosslink network limit the free movement of grafted polymer brushes and thus the critical temperature has a shift to high temperature. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

84867905005	Photoreactive, core-shell cross-linked/hollow microspheres prepared by delayed addition of cross-linker in dispersion polymerization for antifouling and immobilization of protein	When dispersion polymerization of styrene (St) had run for 3. h, after particle rapidly growing stage, 4,4'-dimethacryloyloxybenzophenone (DMABP) cross-linker was added to reaction system and photoreactive, core(PSt)-shell(Poly(St-co-DMABP)) particles with rich benzophenone (BP) groups on surface were prepared. Polymerization of DMABP could occurred mainly on the preformed core of PSt because its diffusion could be impeded by (1) compactness of particles formed at the moment of cross-linker addition (more than 80% of monomer had been consumed, particles were no longer fully swollen by monomer), (2) reduced polarity of continuous phase, and (3) immediate occurrence of cross-linking. Subsequently, photoreactive, cross-linked hollow particles were yielded by removal of uncross-linked core in THF. SEM and TEM observation demonstrated the formation of core-shell structure and improvement of shell thickness when DMABP content increased. UV-vis spectra analysis on polymer dissolved in THF indicated that there is no polymer of DMABP in core. FTIR spectra analysis and XPS measurement further revealed that BP component on particle surface was enriched when amount of DMABP increased. Finally, an anti-fouling polymer (poly (ethylene glycol), PEG) and protein of mouse IgG was immobilized on particle surface under UV irradiation, as confirmed by FTIR spectra analysis, SEM observation and TMB color reaction. © 2012.

84869425666	High immobilization of antibacterial moieties onto monodisperse microspheres by dispersion polymerization using bicationic viologen surfmer	In order to achieve monodisperse particles with high content of antibacterial groups covalently bonded on surface, a bicationic viologen, N-hexyl-N′-(4-vinylbenzyl)-4,4′-bipyridinium bromide chloride (HVV) was devised as a surfmer in dispersion polymerization of styrene (St) using a mixture of methanol (or ethylene glycol) and water as media. Effects of content of HVV, its addition profile and composition of reaction media on particles size and incorporation of HVV moieties were mainly investigated. The attachment of silver and gold nanoparticles on particle surface under UV irradiation ascertained the surface-bonded HVV segments. SEM, TEM observations and XPS, zata potential measurements indicated that increase of initial HVV contents and addition of HVV (when polymerization had been performed for 3 h) led to grown particles and enhanced immobilization of HVV moieties. Using a mixture of ethylene glycol and water as reaction media, small particles (520-142 nm) with highly attached HVV moieties were prepared. Furthermore, antibacterial efficacy of the resultant particles against S. aureus was assayed, and particles with more HVV moieties anchored on surface demonstrated greater efficiency of antibacterial activity. © 2012 Chinese Chemical Society Institute of Chemistry, CAS Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Helical poly(N-propargylamide) bearing a-bromoisobutyryl pendent groups was synthesized via catalytic polymerization, followed by substituting the -Br moieties with azido groups. Then, alkynyl terminated PNIPAm formed via ATRP was successfully grafted onto the azido functionalized helical polymer backbones via click chemistry, providing the expected polymer brushes. GPC, FT-IR, and 1H-NMR measurements indicated the successful synthesis of the novel amphiphilic polymer brushes. UV-vis and CD spectra evidently demonstrated the helical structures of the polymer backbones and the considerable optical activity of the final brushes. The polymer brushes self-assembled in aqueous solution forming core/shell structured nanoparticles, which were comprised of optically active cores (helical polyacetylenes) and thermosensitive shells (PNIPAm). © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84873394614	Simple strategy to functionalize polymeric substrates via surface-initiated ATRP for biomedical applications	The functionalization of polymer surfaces via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) is of crucial importance to prepare various functional materials. It is generally complicated to conduct ATRP on different organic material surfaces. In this work, a facile photoinduced one-step method was first developed for the covalent immobilization of ATRP initiators on the C-H group-containing substrates such as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). The C-H bonds of precise location of inert polymer surfaces were readily transferred to bromoalkyl initiator, followed by ATRP of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), respectively, to produce the resultant patterned BOPP-g-P(DMAEMA) and BOPP-g-P(GMA) films. The epoxy groups of the P(GMA) microdomains can be aminated for covalently coupling IgG, while the P(DMAEMA) microdomains were used for immobilizing IgG via electronic interactions. The resultant IgG-coupled microdomains could interact with the corresponding target proteins, anti-IgG. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84874839715	Study on the compatibility of PA6/LLDPE/nano-sized copolymer microspheres composites	Crosslinked maleic anhydride-vinyl acetate copolymer microspheres were synthesized by charge transfer complexes (CTC) self-stable precipitation polymerization with mean diameter of about 150 nm. Afterwards,copolymer microspheres/poly (ethylene) composites (CM/LLDPE) with low CM contents were used as pre-dispersed composites and melt-mixed with nylon6 (PA6) resin to prepare a series of PA6/LLDPE/CM composites with low CM contents. It was found that the divinylbenzene' s double bond groups and poly(ethylene), anhydride groups and nylon6 produced chemical reaction on phase interface respectively. According to the SEM analyses, it was found that the effect of various amounts of copolymer microspheres on the morphological structure and size of dispersed phase was obvious. It can effectively reduce the size of dispersed phase to fill the copolymer microspheres; on the surface of poly (ethylene) dispersed phase, the nano-sized microspheres played the role of a dispersed phase stabilizer, and this was similar to the emulsifier in emulsion polymerizationin. When the nano-sized microspheres content reached about 1.75%, the performance of composites was improved obviously: the impact strength of composites was increased by 1.35 times compared to pure nylon 6, although the tensile strength and Young's modulus of composites were reduced by about 10%. The water absorption percentage droped to 1. 2% compared to 4. 9% of pure nylon 6. The toughening mechanism was also discussed in this paper;it was a new and important method to compatibilize two phase by stabilizing the size of dispersed phase.

84876340724	A novel macroinitiator based on the copolymer of α-methylstyrene synthesis and its application in preparing block and graft polymers	Due to the steric hindrance effects in combination with stability of the tertiary benzylic α-methylstyryl radical, there is a dynamic equilibrium between the monomer α-methylstyrene (AMS) and its polymer (PAMS) when the temperature is greater than 61°C (the ceiling polymerization temperature). Based on this unique feature, a novel strategy to prepare copolymers of AMS having liable bonds as potential macromolecular free radical initiators for synthesizing block and graft copolymers has been successfully developed in our laboratory. By conventional free radical polymerization, a series of AMS copolymers, including copolymers with (meth) acrylate, acrylic acid, styrene and maleic anhydride were synthesized. Typically, with the increasing of AMS fraction in monomer feed, the rate of copolymerization was significantly retarded and the molecular weight of the copolymers was reduced. However, the copolymer yield could be as high as 90% (w) with the increased addition of initiator, up to 4% (w), and the molar fraction of AMS structural unit in AMS copolymers could be up to 25% (mol%). It has been demonstrated that the copolymers containing AMS structural units are efficient free radical initiators when the temperature is greater than 80°C (much better higher than 90°C). These copolymers could be exploited as macroinitiator in preparing block copolymers and core-shell polymer particles by bulk, solution and emulsion polymerization processes. In addition, the experimental results demonstrated that the molecular weight of copolymer products prepared with AMS copolymers as macromolecular initiators increased steadily with the monomer conversion. Though the polymerization initiated by AMS copolymers was not a well-controlled living system yet, it showed some characteristics of living polymerization. The ESR spectrum presented direct evidence of the generation of carbon centered radicals in the products of copolymer of AMS with glycidyl methacrylate (PAG) heated with N-t-butyl-α-phenylnitrone at 90°C in toluene. Besides initiating the polymerization of vinyl monomer to prepare diblock copolymer, the AMS copolymers offered a practical pathway to synthesize grafting polymers in melting state. For example, with the addition of PAG in the PP/Nylon melten blending, it has been demonstrated a significant in situ compatibilization effect and the formation of graft polymer of PAG and PP. Furthermore, the AMS copolymers could also be used to modify MWCNT by free radical grafting onto mechanism. Instead of com-peting with the other existing controlled free radical polymerization technologies, the AMS copolymer method, with competitive cost and no small molecular residues, offers an alternative tool for polymer chemists to develop block copolymers on an industrial scale for some applications, such as dispersant and compatibilizer. © 2013 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

84879460414	A facile, green, versatile protocol to prepare polypropylene-g-poly(methyl methacrylate) copolymer by water-solid phase suspension grafting polymerization using the surface of reactor granule technology polypropylene granules as reaction loci	A facile and environment friendly process, called water-solid phase suspension grafting polymerization, was developed to prepare polypropylene-g-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PP-g-PMMA) copolymer with a submicrometer microdomain. In this approach, graft polymerization was elaborately regulated to occur within micropores of polypropylene particles prepared by reactor granule technology. FTIR spectra of the samples after extraction demonstrated that PMMA was successfully grafted onto the PP. The results showed grafting percentage (GP) of PMMA increased with the increasing monomer ratios to PP and that could reach 13.6%. Whereas the grafting efficiency decreased as the monomer ratio increased. The addition of second monomer styrene improved GP up to 24.5%. Differential Scanning Calorimetry tests showed that the grafting of PMMA have a slight effect on the melting point and the relative crystallinity of PP. TEM micrographs demonstrated PMMA domains distributed in PP matrix with sizes ranging from about 100 to 300 nm. In addition, Shear viscosity increased with the growing GP indicated by rheological measurement. The preliminary evaluation showed PP-g-PMMA was effective in improving the compatibility of PP/acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate blends. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

New demands on polymer surfaces have led chemists to develop chemical systems that can directly convert C-H bonds on these soft organic material surfaces into functional groups or polymer chains in facile, efficient, specific, and selective ways. Several methods have been established for C-H transformations in molecules based on the use of different catalysts such as transition metal complexes, enzymes, and pure organic compound-catalyzed coupling methods. Examples based on photochemistry have emerged to achieve chemoselective activation of C-H bonds, which have become the emphasis of extensive discussion and summary. Top-down techniques such as photochemistry, which facilitate the preparation of gradient surfaces, have also found a wide range of applications in high-tech fields.

SMA was saponified with KOH to get SMAA,and the resulting SMA A then served as polymeric surfactant for the suspension polymerization of St. The influence of ionization degree of SMAA, rotation speed and weight ratio of St to water on the size and morphology of the obtained PS particles has been studied in detail by optical microscopy and SEM. When ionization degree of the SMAA was 50%,the SMAA was partially saponified product containing both carboxylic acid and carboxylate groups. By using this SMAA as polymeric surfactant,spindle PS particles were prepared at high ratios of St to water(3. 0: 3. 5-3.0=4. 5) and medium rotation speeds. At optimum reaction conditions, the average size of the particles was 6. 8 mm in length, 1.4 mm in width, 0.5 mm in thickness and the ratio of length to width was 5. 0. With increasing rotation speed,the size of the particles decreased gradually and the ratio of length to width became higher. Based on these experiment results,the formation mechanism of the PS nonspherical particles by suspension polymerization in the presence of SMAA was preliminarily proposed.

84885332490	Surfactant-free emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by α-methyl styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer macroinitiator	The copolymer of a-methyl styrene (AMS) and maleic anhydride (MANH) was synthesized by self-stable precipitation polymerization. The resulting AMS-MANH copolymer was saponified and then served as macroinitiator and emulsifier for the further surfactant-free polymerization of methyl methacrylate ( MMA ). Surfactant-free emulsion polymerization of MMA was carried at 90°C. The AMS-MANH copolymer and the obtained block-copolymer were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the surfactant-free polymerization of MMA can be carried out by using saponified AMS-MANH copolymer,without any other initiator and emulsifier. Based on FTIR and 'H-NMRjthe emulsion polymerization product was block copolymer of PMMA and AMS-MANH copolymer. During the process of surfactant-free polymerization of MMA, the polymerization rate increased along with the increasing of the concentration of macroinitiator. The maximum of polymerization conversion was 85% and the particle sizes ranged from 150 nm to 200 nm. The intrinsic viscosity number of the copolymer was about 80 mL/g. In addition, the intrinsic viscosity numbers of copolymers increased linearly with the rising of polymerization conversion. Based on the research results,a possible reaction mechanism has been proposed. This novel method is expected to be applied to other kinds of monomers.

However, it is still a challenge to prepare functional polymeric NPs, especially for particle diameters smaller than 50 nm. In this work, we demonstrate a one-pot method to fabricate reactive poly(divinyl benzene-co-maleic anhydride) NPs (PDVBMAH NPs) through a self-stable precipitation polymerization process. The size and morphology of these PDVBMAH NPs were characterized in detail by scanning electronic microscopy, and their chemical structure was determined by IR. The results showed that these NPs were highly cross-linked and their diameter was about 30 nm with narrow distribution. Additionally, the DVB and MAH endow the NPs with reactive surface anhydride and pendant vinyl groups, and these particles could be further functionalized through reaction of these groups. A plausible pathway was proposed for the formation of PDVBMAH NPs. © 2013 Wan-Tai Yang. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

The polymerization proceeds to give a high yield graft copolymer, however it was observed that even in the early stage of the polymerization there formed an insoluble polymer. In the presence of tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TETD) the gel fraction of the yield graft copolymer was drastically reduced and the polymerization was retarded as well. When the [TETD]/[VBDC] increased from 0 to 1.0, the gel fraction of the graft copolymer decreased from 33.2% to 1.6% (wt) while the fraction of the homopolymer of the MMA increased from 4.5% to 10.5% (wt).

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and fluorescence spectrometry are used to investigate the morphologies and optical properties of the composites. By adjusting the PVP content and reaction time, fluorescent silica-doped PVP film and fluorescent PVP-covered silica core-shell nanoparticles are obtained without stirring and under magnetic stirring, respectively. Because both the silica nanoparticles and the dye molecules react with ring-opened PVP, the composites exhibit highly stable optical properties.

With isoamyl acetate as solvent, the effects of polymerization conditions, such as reaction temperature and concentrations of AIBN, on both the yield and number average molecular weight (Mn) of polymers were investigated in detail. For bulk polymerization of TFEMA, the molecular weight was as high as 1,471,000 with the monomer conversion up to 90% when the reaction temperature was 60°C and AIBN was 0.5 wt% to monomer. Interestingly, the experiment results showed that the water contact angles of the poly-TFEMA films increased from 98 ± 1° to 118 ± 1°when the Mn of poly-TFEMA increased from 95,000 to 1,471,000. Surface analysis techniques, including contact angle measurement, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), were used to characterize the surface hydrophilicity, roughness, surface morphology and chemical composition of the polymer films. The results demonstrated that the degree of the roughness of the film surface increased with an increase of polymer molecular weight while the surfaces chemical compositions had almost no significant variation. The changing of the water contact angle with the Mn of the poly-TFEMA is likely due to the roughness of the film surface which depended on the Mn of the poly-TFEMA. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

84902481895	An extremely simple method for fabricating 3D protein microarrays with an anti-fouling background and high protein capacity	Protein microarrays have become vital tools for various applications in biomedicine and bio-analysis during the past decade. The intense requirements for a lower detection limit and industrialization in this area have resulted in a persistent pursuit to fabricate protein microarrays with a low background and high signal intensity via simple methods. Here, we report on an extremely simple strategy to create three-dimensional (3D) protein microarrays with an anti-fouling background and a high protein capacity by photo-induced surface sequential controlled/living graft polymerization developed in our lab. According to this strategy, "dormant" groups of isopropyl thioxanthone semipinacol (ITXSP) were first introduced to a polymeric substrate through ultraviolet (UV)-induced surface abstraction of hydrogen, followed by a coupling reaction. Under visible light irradiation, the ITXSP groups were photolyzed to initiate surface living graft polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl methacrylate (PEGMMA), thus introducing PEG brushes to the substrate to generate a full anti-fouling background. Due to the living nature of this graft polymerization, there were still ITXSP groups on the chain ends of the PEG brushes. Therefore, by in situ secondary living graft cross-linking copolymerization of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), we could finally plant height-controllable cylinder microarrays of a 3D PEG network containing reactive epoxy groups onto the PEG brushes. Through a commonly used reaction of amine and epoxy groups, the proteins could readily be covalently immobilized onto the microarrays. This delicate design aims to overcome two universal limitations in protein microarrays: a full anti-fouling background can effectively eliminate noise caused by non-specific absorption and a 3D reactive network provides a larger protein-loading capacity to improve signal intensity. The results of non-specific protein absorption tests demonstrated that the introduction of PEG brushes greatly improved the anti-fouling properties of the pristine low-density polyethylene (LDPE), for which the absorption to bovine serum albumin was reduced by 83.3%. Moreover, the 3D protein microarrays exhibited a higher protein capacity than the controls to which were attached the same protein on PGMA brushes and monolayer epoxy functional groups. The 3D protein microarrays were used to test the immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in human serum, suggesting that they could be used for biomedical diagnosis, which indicates that more potential bio-applications could be developed for these protein microarrays in the future.

The resulting copolymers, designated as PAS, were characterized by FTIR, GPC, NMR and TGA. When the reaction temperature was below 75°C, the molecular weights increased almost linearly as the evolution of the copolymerization. The phenomenon revealed that AMS could mediate the conventional free radical polymerization having some features of a controlled system. As the AMS/St = 50/50 (molar) in feed, the overall fraction of the AMS unit incorporated into the copolymer was as high as 42 mol%, the monomer conversion could be more than 90 wt% and the molecular weights could reach as high as 4400.

However, synthesis and purification of organotellurium compounds are time-consuming and to be operated in an inert atmosphere due to their extreme sensitivity to trace oxygen.

It has demonstrated that the crude organotellurium compound, ethyl 2-phenyltellanyl-2-methylpropionate, could mediate 2,2′-azobis (isobutyronitrile) initiated styrene (St) and butyl acrylate (BA) polymerization as an LRP system. For the bulk and solution polymerization of St and the solution polymerization of BA, the molecular weights of produced polymers increased linearly with the monomer conversions. During the same time, the molecular weight distributions kept under 1.3. The UV-vis spectrum showed that the PS polymer chain bearing C-TePh end group. With the sequential monomer addition technique, a clean diblock polymer of PS-b-PBA was also obtained. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84907494103	Construction of DNA microarrays on cyclic olefin copolymer surfaces using confined photocatalytic oxidation	During recent research on the fabrication of DNA microarrays, polymers have been intensively investigated as substrates for immobilizing oligonucleotides, due to their low cost, disposability and excellent processing flexibility. Among these, cyclic olefin copolymers (COCs) are of special interest because of their many favorable properties, including high glass transition temperature, low auto-fluorescence, optical clarity and resistance to organic solvents. In the present study a novel strategy has been developed by introducing epoxy groups on the COC surface, based on a confined photocatalytic oxidation (CPO) method. Firstly, a sulfate anion (-SO

84919754665	A mild strategy to encapsulate enzyme into hydrogel layer grafted on polymeric substrate	Although the hydrogel network has been widely investigated as a carrier for enzyme immobilization, to in situ encapsulate enzymes into a hydrogel network in an efficient, practical, and active way is still one of the great challenges in the field of biochemical engineering. Here, we report a new protocol to address this issue by encapsulating enzyme into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel network grafted on polymeric substrates. In our strategy, isopropyl thioxanthone semipinacol (ITXSP) dormant groups were first planted onto the surface of a plastic matrix with low density polyethylene (LDPE) film as a model by a UV-induced abstracting hydrogen-coupling reaction. As a proof of concept, lipase, which could catalyze esterification of glucose with palmitic acid, then was in situ net-immobilized into a PEG-based hydrogel network layer through a visible light-induced surface controlled/living graft cross-linking polymerization. This strategy demonstrates the following novel significant merits: (1) in comparison with the UV irradiation or high temperature, the visible light and room temperature used provide a friendly condition to maintain activity of enzyme during immobilization; (2) the uniqueness of controlled/living cross-linking polymerization not only makes it easy to form a uniform PEG hydrogel network, which is a benefit to avoid the leakage of net-immobilizing enzyme, but also to tune the net-thickness or capacity to accommodate enzyme; and (3) as compared to systems of nanoparticles and porous matrixes, the flexible/robust end-products of the surface net-immobilizing enzyme with polymer film are more suitable to be applied in a bioreactor due to their features of easier separation and reuse. We confirmed that this catalytic film could retain almost all of its initial activity after seven batches of 24 h esterifications. The proposed strategy provides an extremely simple, effective, and flexible method for enzyme immobilization.

13344262661	A study on the synthesis, characterization and properties of polyaniline using acrylic acid as a primary dopant. I: Polymerization and polymer	In the presence of acrylic acid (AA) as a primary dopant, polyaniline (PANI) doped with poly(-acrylic acid) was successfully synthesized by using ammonium persulfate (APS) as initiator and oxidizing agent. The effect of experimental conditions on the polymer yields was systematically studied. It was found that the polymer yield can be as high as 65%, and this value strongly depends on synthesis conditions, such as the reaction time, the molar ratio of oxidizing agent to aniline monomer, the concentration of reactants and reaction temperature. The molecular weight (M̄

84924059999	Studies on ultrasound emulsification-Pickering emulsion polymerization with aminolyzed PDVB-alt-MAH nanoparticles as stabilizer	The present work reports on a method of ultrasound emulsification-Pickering emulsion polymerization, which was developed to fabricate polystyrene (PSt) microspheres through the assistant technique of ultrasonic emulsification in a reaction system consisting of the immobilizer aminolyzed poly(divinylbenzene-alt-maleic anhydride) nanoparticles (PDVB-alt-MAH nanoparticles, PDMNPs), the initiator 2,2-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), the medium deionized water and monomer styrene (St). The morphology and diameter were characterized through scanning electronic microscope (SEM) and laser particle sizer. The influences of emulsion stability, mechanical agitation speed and stabilizer usage on polymerization were investigated, respectively. It can be found that ultrasonic emulsification and mechanical agitation were necessary for the formation and stabilization of emulsion; meanwhile, the diameter of PSt microspheres could be controlled in the range of 200 nm to 90 nm with increasing amount of aminolyzed PDMNPs. Moreover, studies on the polymerization kinetics and the chemical structure of PSt microspheres were then conducted through gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). Based on the results, the highlights of this polymerization method are as follows: (1) high efficiency of stabilization of aminolyzed PDMNPs; (2) simple device of ultrasonic emulsification; (3) the surfactant-free polymer microspheres with narrow-distributed diameter. Furthermore, this polymerization method was then successfully used in polymerizations of other oil-soluble monomers, such as methyl methacrylate (MMA), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and α-methyl styrene (AMS). It therefore indicated that the present work not only developed a novel strategy for Pickering emulsion polymerization, but also broadened the field of industrial preparation of polymer microspheres.
