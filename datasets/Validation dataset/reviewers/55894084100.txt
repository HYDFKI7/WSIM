18944382736	Improvement of characteristic temperature for AlGaInP laser diodes	An optimized 650-nm AlGaInP multiple-quantum-well (MQW) laser, which has a compressively strained graded-index separate confinement heterostructure (GRIN-SCH), with improved characteristic temperature, is described. We theoretically show that the parabolic GRIN-SCH has a better carrier injection and smaller overflow than the conventional step-SCH for the AlGaInP LD under identical optical confinement. We have also calculated the electron distribution in the quantum wells for both GRIN-SCH-4QW and SCH-4QW at high temperature. The results indicate that the electron leakage to the p-cladding layer is greatly reduced if the GRIN-SCH-4QW structure is used. We have also compared the performance of LDs with different GRIN-SCH profiles and found that the parabolic GRIN-SCH is better than linear GRIN-SCH in terms of carrier confinement. We have further demonstrated the performance of AlGaInP LDs with four different structures (4-QW step-SCH, 5-QW step-SCH, 4-QW parabolic-GRIN-SCH and 5-QW parabolic-GRIN-SCH). Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the laser diode with GRIN-SCH-4QW shows the best laser performance among the three structures. A characteristic temperature of 110 K has been demonstrated.

Specifically, the optical performance of the Cr:YSO Q-switched Cr:LiSAF laser as functions of the initial population in the ground state of the Cr:YSO saturable absorber, the pumping rate, the reflectivity of the output coupler, and the dissipative loss inside the laser cavity are studied. Simulation results show that the Cr:YSO is an effective saturable absorber Q switch for the Cr:LiSAF laser over its entire tuning range. Unlike the Cr:YSO Q-switched alexandrite laser and the Cr:YSO Q-switched Cr:LiCAF laser, the Cr:YSO Q-switched Cr:LiSAF laser has similar passive Q-switching performance when the laser polarization is along each of the three principal axes of the Cr:YSO.

Specifically, the effects of electronic current overflow and inhomogeneous carrier distribution on the laser performance of InGaN QW lasers operating at different wavelengths are investigated. Simulation results indicate that the use of an AlGaN blocking layer can help reduce the electronic current overflow and, in addition to the dissociation of the InGaN well layer at a high growth temperature during crystal growth, the inhomogeneous carrier distribution in the QWs also plays an important role in the laser performance. From the simulation results, we conclude that the lowest threshold current density is obtained when the number of InGaN well layers is two if the emission wavelength is shorter than 427 nm and one if the emission wavelength is longer than 427 nm, which are in good agreement with the results observed by Nakamura et al. in their experiments.

33646199240	Optimization of oxide-confinement and active layers for high-speed 850-nm VCSELs	Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers with variant compressively strained InGaAlAs quantum wells have been investigated. The valence band structures, optical gain spectra, and threshold properties of InGaAlAs/AlGaAs quantum wells are compared and analyzed. The simulation results indicate that the characteristics of InGaAlAs quantum wells can be improved by increasing the amount of compressive strain in quantum well. Furthermore, the properties of VCSELs with these compressively strained InGaAlAs quantum welk are studied numerically. The results of numerical calculations show that the threshold current and maximum output power can be enhanced by using higher compressively strained InGaAlAs quantum well. However, when the compressive strain is larger than about 1.5%, further improvement of the laser performance becomes minimal. The effects of the position and aperture size of the oxide-confinement layers on the laser performance are also investigated. Variation of the oxide layer design is shown to affect the current distribution which makes the temperature in the active region different. It is the main reason for the power roll-off in the VCSEL devices.

The optimum active layer materials of AlGaInAs/InP and InGaNAs/GaAs system are suggested. For the AlGaInAs/InP system, we optimize the structure by varying the number of quantum wells, the linear GRINSCH, and the compensated tensile strain in barriers. The optimized active structure possesses four quantum wells, linear GRINSCH, and a compensated tensile strain in the barrier of 0.325% at an emission wavelength of 1.3 μm. The characteristic temperature can be improved to 99.4K, 51.0K, and 68.6K as it is operating among 288K-318K, 318K-348K, and 288K-348K respectively. Furthermore, the optimized structure can also enhance the stimulated recombination rate and reduce the Auger recombination rate because of the compensated tensile strain in barriers. The simulation results show that the active layer with a certain amount of compensated tensile strain in barriers is beneficial for improving the laser performance. On the other hand, the performance of the InGaNAs/GaAs lasers with quantum wells of different compressive strains is investigated. The wavelength of InGaNAs/GaAs system is about 1.3 μm if the Ga composition in quantum wells is 0.54.

The experimental measurements and simulation results are in close agreement for maximum blue shift. Base on the simulation, the difference between blue shift caused by band filling effect and red shift caused by lateral carrier confinement are approximately the same. Hence, the maximum blue shift increases when the size of micro-size LED increases because of decreased red shift resulted from thermal effect. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Under this circumstance, the electron leakage current and the laser threshold current can obviously be decreased as compared with the laser structure with a conventional AlGaN EBL when the built-in polarization is taken into account in the calculation. Furthermore, the AlInGaN EBL also gives a higher refractive index than the AlGaN EBL, which is a benefit for a higher quantum-well optical confinement factor in laser operations. © 2008 IEEE.

Specifically, the band diagram, carrier distribution, radiative recombination current, and light-current performance curves are discussed for various polarization situations.

Therefore, the band diagram and overlap between electrons and holes in quantum wells are improved effectively and the light-current performance is raised apparently as the piezoelectric polarization is removed and only the spontaneous polarization is taken into account. The possible reason is that the influence of piezoelectric polarization due to lattice constant mismatch on optical properties is severe than the spontaneous polarization due to asymmetry of the wurtzite structure along the c-axis.

Furthermore, it is found that the different values of the ridge height cause the lateral carrier distribution within the active region to be varied, which is also an important factor in determining the emergence of the first order lateral mode in addition to the geometry-dependent waveguide cutoff condition. © 2009 The Optical Society of Japan.

67650504960	Advantages of blue InGaN multiple-quantum well light-emitting diodes with InGaN barriers	The advantages of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with InGaN barriers are studied. The L-I curves, carrier concentrations in the quantum wells, energy band diagrams, and internal quantum efficiency are investigated. The simulation results show that the InGaN/InGaN LED has better performance over its conventional InGaN/GaN counterpart due to the enhancement of electron confinement, the reduced polarization effect between the barrier and well, and the lower potential barrier height for the holes to transport in the active region. The simulation results also suggest that the efficiency droop is markedly improved when the traditional GaN barriers are replaced by InGaN barriers. © 2009 American Institute of Physics.

67650698547	Effect of N-type AlGaN layer on carrier transportation and efficiency droop of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes	The effect of an n-type AlGaN layer on the physical properties of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is investigated numerically. The p-type AlGaN electron-blocking layer is usually used in blue LEDs to reduce the electron leakage current. However, the p-type AlGaN layer also retards the injection of holes, which leads to the degradation of efficiency at high current. To improve the efficiency droop of blue InGaN LEDs at high current, an n-type AlGaN layer below the active region is proposed to replace the traditional p-type AlGaN layer. The simulation results show that the improvement in efficiency droop is due mainly to the sufficiently reduced electron leakage current and more uniform distribution of holes in the quantum wells. © 2009 IEEE.

69849110997	Numerical simulation of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes with polarization-matched AlGaInN electron-blocking layer and barrier layer	The effect of polarization-matched AlGaInN electron-blocking layer and barrier layer on the optical performance of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes is numerically investigated. The polarization-matched AlGaInN electron-blocking layer and barrier layer are employed in an attempt to reduce the polarization effect inside the active region of the light-emitting diodes. The simulation results show that the polarization-matched AlGaInN electron-blocking layer is beneficial for confining the electrons inside the quantum well region. With the use of both polarization-matched AlGaInN electron-blocking layer and barrier layer, the optical performance of blue InGaN light-emitting diodes is greatly improved due to the increased overlap of electron and hole wavefunctions. The method proposed in this paper can also be applied to the light-emitting diodes operating in other spectral range. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Auger recombination behavior is quite different under widely varied Auger coefficients. The effect of Auger coefficient on the efficiency and output power is investigated numerically. The simulation results indicate that the Auger recombination with large Auger coefficient greatly decreases the efficiency in the whole current range under study. It is found that the electron current leakage and nonuniform hole distribution are the possible mechanisms responsible for the efficiency droop at high injection current. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

Moreover, to increase the hole injection and improve the carrier distribution across the multiple quantum wells, the three barriers near the p-layers are p-doped with a gradually increased doping concentration in a blue InGaN light-emitting diode. According to the simulation results, when the stepwise p-doping profile is used in the selected barrier regions, the output power and internal quantum efficiency markedly improve due to the increased hole injection efficiency and decreased electron leakage. © 2006 IEEE.

The best light-emitting performance under normal and reversed polarization is obtained in a single quantum-well structure and double quantum-well structure, respectively. The key factors responsible for these phenomena are presumably the carrier concentration distribution and the amount of carriers in quantum wells. The turn-on voltage of light-emitting diodes under reversed polarization is lower than that of light-emitting diodes under normal polarization, due mainly to lower potential heights for electrons and holes in the active region. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

The lightcurrent curves, energy band diagrams, carrier concentrations, radiative recombination efficiency, and internal quantum efficiency of the blue LEDs under study are investigated. The simulation results show that the efficiency droop is significantly improved when the last undoped GaN barrier in a typical blue LED is replaced by a p-type GaN barrier. The simulation results suggest that the improvement in efficiency droop is mainly due to the decrease of electron current leakage and increase of hole injection efficiency. © 2010 IEEE.

77953296477	Role of electron blocking layer in III-nitride laser diodes and light-emitting diodes	A high energy bandgap electron blocking layer (EBL) just behind the active region is conventionally used in the nitride-based laser diodes (LDs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to improve the confinement capability of electrons within the quantum wells. Nevertheless, the EBL may also act as a potential barrier for the holes and cause non-uniform distribution of holes among quantum wells. A most recent study by Han et al. (Appl. Phys. Lett. 94, 231123, 2009) reported that, because of the blocking effect for holes, the InGaN LED device without an EBL has slighter efficiency droop and higher light output at high level of current injection when compared with the LED device with an EBL. This result seems to contradict with the original intention of using the EBL. Furthermore, findings from our previous studies (IEEE J. Lightwave Technol. 26, 329, 2008; J. Appl. Phys. 103, 103115, 2008; Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 201118, 2007) indicated that the utilization of EBL is essential for the InGaN laser diodes. Thus, in this work, the optical properties of the InGaN LDs and LEDs are explored numerically with the LASTIP simulation program and APSYS simulation program, respectively. The analyses focus particularly on the light output power, energy band diagrams, recombination rates, distribution of electrons and holes in the active region, and electron overflow. This study will then conclude with a discussion of the effect of EBL on the optical properties of the InGaN LDs and LEDs. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

The solar cell structure used as a reference was based on a published article by Geisz et al. (Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 023502, 2007). By optimizing the layer thickness of the top and middle cells, the appropriate solar cell structure which possesses high sunlight-to-energy conversion efficiency is recommended. At AM1.5G and one sun, the conversion efficiency is improved by 2.3%. At AM0 and one sun, the conversion efficiency is improved by 4.2%. At AM1.5D and one sun, the conversion efficiency is improved by 1.3%. Furthermore, based on the optimized structures, this device can achieve efficiencies of more than 40% at high concentrations. For the triple-junction solar cell under AM1.5G solar spectrum, the conversion efficiency reaches 40.2% at 40 suns. For the device under AM0 solar spectrum, the conversion efficiency reaches 36.2% at 30 suns. For the device under AM1.5D solar spectrum, the conversion efficiency reaches 40.2% at 50 suns. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

For the laser structures under normal polarization, the lowest threshold current is obtained when the number of quantum wells is two in the spectral range of 380-408 nm. For the laser structures under reversed polarization, the single quantum-well laser structure possesses the lowest threshold current. The simulation results suggest that the physical origin for these phenomena is caused by the sufficiently suppressed electron and hole leakage currents when the laser diode is under reversed polarization. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental measurement shows that the optical power of the InGaN LED with thinner last barrier is apparently improved. According to simulation analysis, thinner last barrier is beneficial for increasing the hole injection efficiency and holes can inject into more quantum wells within the active region. With better hole injection efficiency, the leakage electrons from active region to p-side layers are depressed correspondingly. Therefore, the radiative recombination and optical power are enhanced accordingly when the thinner last barrier is utilized. © 2006 IEEE.

Compared with the original structure with equal barrier thickness, the analyses focus on hole injection efficiency, carrier distribution, electron leakage, and radiative recombination. Simulation approach yields to a result that, when varied barrier thicknesses are used, more than one quantum well contributes to radiative recombination at high injection current which leads to the improvement of efficiency droop. Further analysis indicates that the thinner barrier located close to the p-side layers is beneficial for increasing hole injection, which leads to the reduction of electron leakage; moreover, holes can be confined in more quantum wells in such condition as well. © 2006 IEEE.

The simulation results show that, for the LEDs with GaN barriers, the single quantum-well (SQW) structure has the best optical performance. However, for the LEDs with InGaN barriers, the 5-QW structure has less serious efficiency droop and higher output power at high current than the SQW one, which makes it a better structure for high-power LEDs. The physical mechanisms of the aforementioned phenomena can be well explained by uniformity of carrier distribution, band-filling effect, and overlap between the electron and hole wavefunctions. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

79952942735	Efficiency enhancement of blue InGaN LEDs with indium composition graded InGaN barriers	In recent literatures, the quantum efficiency of conventional blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is quite limited under relatively high driving current with conventional GaN barriers due presumably to the poor injection efficiency of hole. In this study, the efficiency enhancement of blue InGaN LEDs with indium composition graded InGaN barriers is proposed. The energy band diagram, carrier concentration in the quantum wells, diagram of hole current, radiative recombination rate, L-I curves, and internal quantum efficiency are investigated numerically. The simulation results show that the InGaN LED with graded InGaN barriers has better performance over its conventional counterpart with GaN barriers due to enhanced efficiency of hole injection. The simulation results also suggest that under relatively high current injection, the internal quantum efficiency and output light power are markedly improved when the traditional GaN barriers are replaced by graded InGaN barriers. According to the improved optical properties, the new-designed LED has promising potential in solid state lighting. © 2011 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.

Systematic analyses included the energy band diagrams, radiative and SRH recombination rates, distribution of electrons and holes in the active region, and electron overflow. Simulation results show that, with appropriate designs, the efficiency droop may be effectively reduced due to the increase of hole injection efficiency, the enhancement of blocking capability for electrons, or the uniform carrier distribution of carriers in the active region. © 2011 SPIE.

0036438398	Band structures and bandgap bowing parameters of wurtzite and zincblende III-nitrides	The III-nitride semiconductor materials attract much attention in the past few years owing to their important application in light-emitting diodes and semiconductor lasers. Since the III-nitride semiconductor devices are usually grown on the sapphire substrate, they all have wurtzite crystal structures. The energy bandgaps of the wurtzite III-nitrides are usually obtained experimentally. Several researchers have investigated the energy bandgaps and the bandgap bowing parameters of the wurtzite InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN alloys; however, the results are quite diverging. In this work we investigate the band structures of the wurtzite InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN alloys with a CASTEP simulation program. The simulation results suggest that the wurtzite InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN have a bandgap bowing parameter of 1.21 eV, 0.35 eV, and 3.33 eV respectively. Our simulation results also indicate that the widths of the top valance bands of the wurtzite InGaN and AlGaN alloys decrease when the indium and aluminum compositions increase while the width of the AlInN top valence band has a maximum value of about 6.57 eV when the aluminum composition is near 0.53. In this paper, the investigation of the band structures and bandgap bowing parameters for the zincblende InGaN, AlGaN, and AlInN alloys is also reported.

0036438411	Optical performance of Cr:YSO Q-switched Cr:LiCAF and Cr:LiSAF lasers	Both Cr:LiCAF and Cr:LiSAF solid state lasers were developed by Payne et al. As transition-metal vibronic lasers the Cr:LiCAF and Cr:LiSAF exhibit broad emission spectra, long lifetime of the upper laser levels, low nonlinear refractive indices, low thermal lensing, and low excited state absorption that make both of them unique sources for tunable or short pulse lasers. In previous work we had experimentally demonstrated that the Cr:YSO could work as a saturable absorber Q switch for the Cr:LiCAF laser near 780 nm, i.e., the peak of its tuning range. In this work, we theoretically investigate the optical performance of the Cr:YSO Q-switched Cr:LiCAF laser system over its entire tuning range by solving the coupled rate equations. The simulation results indicate that the results obtained numerically are in good agreement with that obtained experimentally. The theoretical simulation also shows that the Cr:YSO may be used as an effective saturable absorber Q switch for the tunable Cr:LiCAF laser over a major portion of its entire tuning range from 725 nm to 840 nm. On the other hand, the Cr:YSO had also been experimentally demonstrated to be an effective saturable absorber Q switch for the tunable Cr:LiSAF laser by Munin et al.

0036439986	Characteristics of 850-nm InGaAs/AlGaAs vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers	The vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) operating in the spectral range near 850 nm usually utilize GaAs/AlGaAs as the active layer materials. In this work, in addition to the traditional unstrained GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor laser, the characteristics of the strained InGaAs/AlGaAs vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser and the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) used in this semiconductor laser are investigated with a PICS3D (abbreviation of Photonic Integrated Circuit Simulator in 3D) simulation program. The simulation results show that the strained InGaAs/AlGaAs VCSEL has a better optical performance than that of the traditional unstrained GaAs/AlGaAs VCSEL. That is, when compared with the unstrained GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well structures, the strained InGaAs/AlGaAs VCSEL has a higher stimulated recombination rate, a lower threshold current, a higher main-side mode suppression ratio, and a higher characteristic temperature, which might be owing to its narrower well width and smaller carrier effective masses.

0036440202	Electronic current overflow and inhomogeneous hole distribution of the InGaN quantum well structures	The InGaN semiconductor materials have important application in visible light-emitting diodes (LED) and short-wavelength laser diodes. In this work we investigate the electronic current overflow and the inhomogeneous hole distribution of the blue InGaN quantum well structures with a LASTIP (abbreviation of LASer Technology Integrated Program) simulation program. The simulation results show that the InGaN quantum well structure has an appreciable electronic current overflow at room temperature. The electronic current overflow problem becomes even more severe at elevated temperatures, which not only affects the emission efficiency of the quantum well structure, but also deteriorates the operation lifetime of the InGaN optical devices. The simulation results indicate that it is possible to improve the electronic current overflow by increasing the doping level of the p-type epi-layers and adding an AlGaN blocking layer in the p-type region. On the other hand, our numerical simulation also shows that, in addition to the electronic current overflow issue, the distribution of the holes in the InGaN active region is very inhomogeneous. It turns out that the laser performance of a single quantum well InGaN laser is better than that of the multiple quantum well lasers. According to our studies, if the barriers between the quantum wells are properly doped, the inhomogeneous hole distribution in the active region may be improved and hence the laser performance of the multiple quantum well InGaN lasers may be enhanced.

In a previous work we experimentally demonstrated that passive Q-switching of the 2017-nm, flashlamp pumped Tm,Cr:YAG laser with a Ho:YLF saturable absorber could be obtained with an internal focusing lens. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the optical performance of the Ho:YLF Q-switched Tm:YAG laser system by solving the coupled rate equations. The simulation results indicate that the results obtained numerically are in good agreement with that obtained experimentally. Moreover, we study the passive Q-switching performance of the Ho:YLF Q-switched Tm:YAG laser system as functions of the reflectivity of the output coupler, the initial population of the saturable absorber ground state, the laser pumping rate, and the loss inside the laser resonator. On the other hand, assuming that a polarizer is utilized inside the laser cavity, we explore the passive Q-switching performance of the Ho:YLF Q-switched Tm:YAG laser system when the polarization of the laser light is along different direction between the two saturable absorber principal axes. Effect of the relative position between the saturable absorber and the output coupler is also investigated.

Because of the enhancement of carrier collection efficiency, the conversion efficiency is improved markedly, which can be ascribed to both the reduction of the polarization-induced electric field in the InGaN absorption layer and the mitigation of potential barriers at heterojunctions.

With the use of the grading layer, the conversion efficiency is markedly promoted due to the reduction of potential barrier height for holes and due to the decrease of polarization. Optimized conversion efficiency is obtained when the thickness of the grading layer increases to a critical value.

Simulation results show that the LED is markedly improved when regular first well is replaced by shallow first well due to reduced polarization field and thereby enhanced injection efficiency of carriers in quantum wells. The proposed structure is beneficial for the blue InGaN LED even at a high level of current injection. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

84870509418	Simulation of high-efficiency GaN/InGaN p-i-n solar cell with suppressed polarization and barrier effects	The photovoltaic characteristics of Ga-face GaN/InGaN p-i-n solar cells are investigated numerically. The severe polarization and barrier effects induced by the GaN/InGaN hetero-interfaces are demonstrated to be detrimental for the carrier collection. The conversion efficiency could be degraded to be out of application when the degree of polarization and/or indium composition are high. To efficiently eliminate both critical issues, the solar cell structure with appropriate band engineering is introduced. In the proposed structure, the photovoltaic characteristics not only show high-grade performance but also become insensitive to the degree of polarization, even in the situation of high indium composition. © 2012 IEEE.

84878130078	Polarization engineering in III-nitride based ultraviolet light-emitting diodes	In this study, the polarization effect in III-nitride based ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been investigated theoretically. Some specific designs in active region are proposed to reduce the polarization effect and, hence, improve the device performance. Simulation results show that by utilizing properly designed quaternary AlInGaN material in active region, the hole injection efficiency can be enhanced due to the reduction of polarization mismatch between hetero-layers. On the other hand, the electron leakage is suppressed owing to that the effective potential height for electrons is increased. Therefore, the performance of UV LEDs is significantly improved by the polarization engineering in active region. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

84878612247	Numerical investigation on the structural characteristics of GaN/InGaN solar cells	In traditional III-nitride solar cells, the polarization-induced charges and potential barrier in the hetero-interfaces are demonstrated to be harmful for carrier collection. To solve these challenges, the elimination or mitigation of the abrupt hetero-interfaces should be efficient. In this study, various kinds of solar cell structures are investigated numerically. The structures under various situations of indium composition and degree of polarization are systematically explored. Specifically, the photovoltaic performance, energy band diagrams, electrostatic fields, and recombination rates are analyzed. Then, according to the simulation results, the appropriate solar cell structure which possesses high conversion efficiency is proposed. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

84878741454	Numerical analysis of using superlattice-AlGaN/InGaN as electron blocking layer in green InGaN light-emitting diodes	In this study, a specific design on the electron blocking layer (EBL) by band engineering is investigated numerically with an aim to improve the output performance and to reduce the efficiency droop in green LEDs. Systematic analyses including the energy band diagrams, carrier distributions in the active region, and electron leakage current are given and the simulation results show that the proposed lattice-compensated superlattice-AlGaN/InGaN EBL can provide better optical and electrical output performances when compared to the conventional rectangular AlGaN EBL. The output power of the green LED can be enhanced by a factor of 52% and the applied voltage can be reduced from 5.08 V to 4.53 V at an injection current of 1500 mA. The internal quantum efficiency is improved and the percentage of the efficiency droop can also be reduced from 58% to 37%, which is mainly attributed to the successful suppression of electron leakage current and improvement in hole injection efficiency. © 2013 SPIE.

84882279365	Numerical study of the suppressed efficiency droop in blue InGaN LEDs with polarization-matched configuration	In blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the intuitive approaches to suppress Auger recombination by reducing carrier density, e.g., increasing the number of quantum wells (QWs) and thickening the width of wells, suffer from nonuniform carrier distribution and more severe spatial separation of electron and hole wave functions. To resolve this issue, LED structures with thick InGaN wells and polarization-matched AlGaInN barriers are proposed theoretically. Furthermore, the number of QWs is reduced for the purpose of mitigating the additional compressive strain in AlGaInN barriers. Simulation results reveal that, in the proposed structures, the quantum-confined Stark effect in strained wells is nearly eliminated through the utilization of polarization-matched barriers, which efficiently promotes internal quantum efficiency. Furthermore, the phenomenon of efficiency droop is also markedly improved because of the uniformly distributed or dispersed carriers, and accordingly the suppressed Auger recombination. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

0042383103	Numerical study of passive Q switching of a Tm:YAG laser with a Ho:YLF solid-state saturable absorber	In a previous work [Appl. Phys. Lett. 65, 3060 (1994)] we experimentally demonstrated that passive Q switching of a 2017-nm, flashlamp-pumped Tm,Cr:YAG laser with a Ho:YLF saturable absorber could be obtained with an internal focusing lens. We numerically investigate the optical performance of the Ho:YLF Q-switched Tm:YAG laser system by solving the coupled rate equations. The simulation results indicate that the results obtained numerically are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally. With typical laser configuration, a Q-switched laser pulse of 35 mJ in 30 ns is obtained. © 2003 Optical Society of America.

84892635577	Hole injection and electron overflow improvement in InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes by a tapered AlGaN electron blocking layer	A tapered AlGaN electron blocking layer with step-graded aluminum composition is analyzed in nitride-based blue light-emitting diode (LED) numerically and experimentally. The energy band diagrams, electrostatic fields, carrier concentration, electron current density profiles, and hole transmitting probability are investigated. The simulation results demonstrated that such tapered structure can effectively enhance the hole injection efficiency as well as the electron confinement. Consequently, the LED with a tapered EBL grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition exhibits reduced efficiency droop behavior of 29% as compared with 44% for original LED, which reflects the improvement in hole injection and electron overflow in our design. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84897409587	Reduced efficiency droop in blue InGaN light-emitting diodes by thin AlGaN barriers	The phenomenon of efficiency droop in blue InGaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is studied numerically. Simulation results indicate that the severe Auger recombination is one critical mechanism corresponding to the degraded efficiency under high current injection. To solve this issue, LED structure with thin AlGaN barriers and without the use of an AlGaN EBL is proposed. The purpose of the strain-compensation AlGaN barriers is to mitigate the strain accumulation in a multiquantum well (MQW) active region in this thin-barrier structure. With the proposed LED structure, the hole injection and transportation of the MQWactive region are largely improved. The carriers can thus distribute/disperse much more uniformly in QWs, and the Auger recombination is suppressed accordingly. The internal quantum efficiency and the efficiency droop are therefore efficiently improved. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84899655436	Tandem structure for efficiency improvement in GaN based light-emitting diodes	The improvement in efficiency of nitride-based light-emitting diodes by the implementation of a vertically stacked tandem structure is investigated. The electrical and optical characteristics of an LED with a tunnel junction inserted between two active regions are modeled, and the wall-plug efficiency gain of the tandem LED is shown to start at 4.2% at low output powers (27.6 mW), with increasing efficiency gains with increased output power due to the alleviation of efficiency droop. The TLED concept further enables optimization of device structure, allowing removal of electron blocking layer, and optimization of number of quantum wells for improvement in efficiency. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

84906715884	Fabrication and characterization of back-side illuminated InGaN/GaN solar cells with periodic via-holes etching and Bragg mirror processes	In this study, the design and fabrication schemes of back-side illuminated InGaN/GaN solar cells with periodic via-holes etching and Bragg mirror processes are presented. Compared to typical front-side illuminated solar cells, the improvements of open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 1.88 to 1.94 V and short-circuit current density (Jsc) from 0.84 to 1.02 mA/cm2 are observed. Most significantly, the back-side illuminated InGaN/GaN solar cells exhibit an extremely high fill factor up to 85.5%, leading to a conversion efficiency of 1.69% from 0.66% of typical frontside illuminated solar cells under air mass 1.5 global illuminations. Moreover, the effects of bottom Bragg mirrors on the photovoltaic characteristics of back-side illuminated solar cells are studied by an advanced simulation program. The results show that the Jsc could further be improved with a factor of 10% from the original back-side illuminated solar cell by the structure optimization of bottom Bragg mirrors. © 2014 Optical Society of America.
