Two modelling-error based adaptive fuzzy systems are utilised to estimate the unknown non-linear systems. Based on the approximation of unknown non-linearities, the equivalent control part of sliding mode control is constructed to adaptively compensate the known part of the uncertainties. Concurrently, a third fuzzy system automatically adjusts the discontinuous gain of switch control to a necessary level in order to overcome the modelling error of the first two fuzzy systems for guaranteeing the reachability of sliding mode. With more knowledge of the uncertainties and acquisition of equivalent control, the switch gain and therefore the chattering can be effectively decreased to the minimum level.

84874135492	A novel genetic algorithm based on immunity and its application	In this paper, a novel genetic algorithm based on immunity (GABI) on the basis of parallel genetic algorithms (PGA) is proposed in order to overcome some defects of them, such as premature and slow convergence rate. The global performance of the algorithm is improved by introducing immunity theory into PGA. This is revealed in the following two aspects. One is that the immune selection based on proposed adjustable geometric-progression rank-based selection can prevent the algorithm from premature. The other is that convergence rate can be accelerate by individual migration strategy between subpopulations based on immune memory mechanism. In this algorithm, the idea of multiple subpopulations evolution based on improved adaptive crossover and mutation is adopted. To be hybridized with the Powell method can further improve local searching performance of the algorithm. An example of layout design shows that GABI is feasible and effective. © 2012 IEEE.

84875899755	Modeling and simulation of wave disturbances for dynamic positioning ship	In order to effectively calculate the effect acted on dynamic positioning (DP) ships by waves, the mathematical model of the wave environmental disturbances is established. Based on the Matlab/Simulink, a simulation platform for the wave disturbance is set up to calculate the effect between ocean environment with wave disturbing force and moment of dynamic positioning ship in any wave height and any wave angle. A supply ship is taken as an example, the influence of wave disturbances forces and moments on the positions of the ship are forecasted based on different wave height and wave angle. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model. The simulation platform can be used for testing the design of dynamic positioning systems controller, which can improve the performance and robustness of the system in extreme sea conditions.

84876101957	A robust adaptive neural networks controller for maritime dynamic positioning system	This paper aims to develop a neural controller using the vectorial backstepping technique for dynamically positioned surface ships with uncertainties and unknown disturbances. The radial basis function networks are employed to compensate for the uncertainties of ship dynamics and disturbances in controller design. The advantage of the proposed control scheme is that there is no requirement of any priori knowledge about dynamics of ships and disturbances. It is shown that our proposed control law can regulate the position and heading of ships to the desired targets with arbitrarily small positioning error. Theoretical results on stability analysis indicate that our proposed controller guarantees uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop system. Simulation studies with comparisons on a supply ship are carried out, and results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic surface control is incorporated into backstepping technique to overcome the problem of its inherent "explosion of terms" so that the control law is simpler and easier to implement in engineering. Nussbaum function is used to deal with the unknown sign of uncertain control coefficient and the possible controller singularity problem. By means of Lyapunov function and the lemma of Nussbaum function, it is proved theoretically that the designed adaptive nonlinear control law can force the actual course of ships to converge to and keep at the desired course of ships, while guarantee the global uniform boundedness of all signals of the resulting closed-loop control system. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through the simulations involving two ships. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84891855022	Output feedback control for dynamic positioning system of a ship based on a high gain observer	Because the velocity vector of the ship is not available, we propose output feedback control for dynamic positioning system of a ship with external disturbances by integrating the high gain observer, the dynamic surface control technique and the vectorial backstepping design. The proposed control scheme only relies on measurements of the ship position and heading. Because of the introduction of the dynamic surface control, the designed control law is simpler and more easily to be implemented in engineering practice. It is proved by means of Lyapunov function that the proposed control law can force the position and heading of the ship to approach the desired values while guaranteeing the uniform ultimate boundedness for all signals of the closed-loop dynamic positioning system. The simulation results on a supply ship are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

84908093087	Robust adaptive NN-based output feedback control for a dynamic positioning ship using DSC approach	A robust adaptive NN-based output feedback control scheme is presented for a dynamic positioning ship with uncertainties and unknown external disturbances. We tackle the problem that velocity vector of a ship is not available by employing a high-gain observer, and develop the proposed control approach by combing vectorial backstepping with dynamic surface control approach, which is simpler and easier to implement in engineering practice.

84911481511	Control law design of dynamic positioning for ship based on dynamic surface control	The control problem of dynamic positioning for surface ship was analyzed, the time-variant environmental disturbances with unknown bounds were considered, the dynamic surface control technology was combined with the vectorial backstepping method, based on which, an adaptive robust nonlinear control law of dynamic positioning was proposed. By introducing the dynamic surface control technique, the proposed control law utilized the differentiation term of the first-order low-pass filter to replace the differentiation term of virtual control vector. As a result, the differentiation operations in the control law design were replaced by the simple algebraic operations. Hence, the control law simplified the computation and was implemented in engineering practice easily. Leakage terms based on a variation of σ-modification were incorporated into the adaptive laws for estimating the unknown bounds of disturbances to prevent parameters from drifting. By using the Lyapunov function, it was proved that the proposed control law could force the ship's position and heading to converge and keep at the desired target values and guarantee the uniformly ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop dynamic positioning system of ship. Simulation result shows that as the initial horizontal-plane position of ship deviates 25 m from the desired position, the ship can achieve the desired position within 50 s based on the control law, so the proposed control law is effective.
