33645996389	Rough learning vector quantization case generation for CBR classifiers	To build competent and efficient CBR classifiers, we develop a case generation approach which integrates fuzzy sets, rough sets and learning vector quantization (LVQ). If the feature values of the cases are numerical, fuzzy sets are firstly used to discretize the feature spaces. Secondly, a fast rough set-based feature selection method is built to identify the significant features. The representative cases (prototypes) are then generated through LVQ learning process on the case bases after feature selection. These prototypes can be also considered as the extracted knowledge which improves the understanding of the case base. Three real life data sets are used in the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of this case generation approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33646734888	Learning similarity measure of nominal features in CBR classifiers	Nominal feature is one type of symbolic features, whose feature values are completely unordered. The most often used existing similarity metrics for symbolic features is the Hamming metric, where similarity computation is coarse-grained and may affect the performance of case retrieval and then the classification accuracy. This paper presents a GA-based approach for learning similarity measure of nominal features for CBR classifiers. Based on the learned similarities, the classification accuracy can be improved, and the importance of each nominal feature can be analyzed to enhance the understanding of the used data sets. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33747597342	An on-line multi-CBR agent dispatching algorithm	Case-based reasoning (CBR) is an effective and fast problem-solving methodology, which solves new problems by remembering and adaptation of past cases. With the increasing requests for useful references for all kinds of problems and from different locations, keeping a single CBR system seems to be outdated and not practical. Multi-CBR agents located in different places are of great support to fast meet these requests. In this paper, the architecture of a multi-CBR agent system is proposed, where the CBR agents locate at different places, and are assumed to have the same ability to deal with new problem independently. When the requests in a request queue from different places are coming one by one, we propose a new policy of dispatching which agent to satisfy the request queue. Throughout the paper, we assume that the system must solve the coming request by considering only past requests. In this context, the performance of traditional greedy algorithms is not satisfactory. We apply a new but simple approach - competitive algorithm for on-line problem (called On-line multi-CBR agent dispatching algorithm) to determine the dispatching policy to keep comparative low cost. The corresponding on-line dispatching algorithm is proposed and the competitive ratio is given. Based on the competitive algorithm, the dispatching of multi-CBR agents is optimized. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

33749647689	Ab initio investigations of the electric field dependence of the geometric and electronic structures of molecular wires	Theoretical investigations on the typical molecular wire, polyacetylene, which bridges two chemically inert electrodes, have been carried out at the Hartree-Fock level by incorporating the external electric field into the calculations. The results demonstrate that both the geometric and the electronic structures of the conjugated molecular wires are sensitive to the electric field. When the electric field increases, the carbon-carbon single bonds become shorter and the double bonds become longer, leading to a higher conjugation. The electric field reduces the HOMO-LUMO gap and increases the dipole moment. The spatial distributions of the molecular orbitals are used to analyze the electrical properties of the molecular wire. All of these features are more pronounced with increasing conjugation chain length. Quantitative correlations between most of these features and the electric field have been discussed as well. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

When the external electric field increases, the single bonds become shorter, the double bonds become longer, and the molecular configuration tends to be more planar. All these features make the molecular wire more conjugated. The molecular electronic structure is sensitive to the electric field as well.

33845802640	Theoretical investigations on the geometric and electronic structures of phenylene-acetylene macrocycles	The geometric and electronic structures of a series of conjugated macrocycles (phenylene-acetylene macrocycles, PAMs) have been studied theoretically with ab initio and semiempirical molecular orbital methods. The ab initio calculations at the HF/6-31G* level demonstrate that the model molecules may have a planar conformation. Bigger macrocycles, for example, 7PAM, 8PAM, and 9PAM, result in several energy minima. The boatlike conformation is the most energetically favored form. Based on the conformational analysis, a novel method for analyzing the ring-strain energy was proposed and used. In view of their potential applications as electronic materials, the electronic structures of a series of PAMs are also investigated. The LUMO-HOMO gaps of the planar PAMs show an odd-even difference behavior. In addition, the HOMOs of the planar species 3PAM, 5PAM, 7PAM, and 9PAM are doubly degenerated. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

It demonstrates that many molecular features are sensitive to the EF applied. In particular, the torsional barrier increases and the LUMO-HOMO gap decreases with the increase of EF. Quantitative correlations between these features and the external EF were revealed.

It demonstrates that the electronic structures of this kind of diode molecule are essentially different from those based on the Aviram and Ratner model, in which donor and acceptor-conjugated segments are separated by an insulating σ-bonded segment, in terms of the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitais as well as their spatial distributions. The introduction of the external EF modifies both the geometric and electronic structures. In particular, the spatial distributions of the frontier molecular orbitals are also shifted under the external EF. Moreover, all these features show strong EF direction dependence due to the build in intrinsic molecular asymmetric features, which could be used to intuitively interpret the asymmetrical current-voltage behaviors of molecules.

The results show that the porphyrin with parallel connection to gold (111) electrodes is more conductive than the porphyrin with diagonal connection to gold (111) electrodes. The mechanism of the difference of electron transport for these two molecular junctions is analyzed from the transmission spectra and the molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian states. It is found that the intrinsic nature of the molecule, such as the π-conjugated framework and the strength of molecule-electrode coupling, are the essential reason for generating this difference of electron transport for the two molecular systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Results of photodegradation tests reveal that the Ag doped hierarchical ZnO microspheres show much better photocatalytic activity than pure ZnO nanomaterials.

The results demonstrate rectification behavior of the diode molecule and the maximum rectification ratio is up to 7.7. The mechanism of the rectification behavior was analyzed in terms of the evolution of molecular energy levels, the change of spatial distribution of molecular orbitals, and the electron transmission spectra. The asymmetric evolutions of the energy levels and the alignment of the states localized on the electro donating and electron withdrawing segments with the applied voltage were found to be essential in generating this rectification behavior for the molecular system. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The electron transport properties were discussed in terms of the spatial distributions of molecular orbitals and the transmission spectra of the molecular wires under various applied voltages.

The results show that both the geometric and electronic structures of the PA molecule are sensitive to the external electric field (EF). For neutral PA molecule, with the increase of EF, the carbon-carbon single bonds are shortened while the carbon-carbon double bonds are elongated. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO-HOMO gap) decreases with the EF increasing. For cationic PA molecule, the carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-carbon double bonds on the high potential side are elongated and shortened, respectively. While, the carbon-carbon single bonds and carbon-carbon double bonds on the low potential side are shortened and elongated, respectively. Contrary to the neutral PA case, the LUMO-HOMO gap increases with the EF increasing. Contrast to the case of cationic PA, the evolution of carbon-carbon bond lengths for the anionic PA molecule under the external EF reverses. The LUMO-HOMO gap of the anionic PA molecule decreases with the increase of external EF. In addition, the spatial distributions of the HOMO and LUMO under the influence of external EF are also discussed for the PA molecule in neutral, cationic, and anionic states. © BME-PT.

77954004485	A review of analytical methods for indium in different content level	This review has summarized the advance of analytical methods for indium in different content level over the last decade, including macro indium, micro indium and trace indium. Among the analytical methods for macro indium, complexometry is the most widely applied technique at present, followed by atomic absorption spectroscopy and polarography. Among the analytical methods for micro indium, spectrophotometry is the most popular. In spectrophotometry, fluorone reagents, azo compounds and dyestuff series are used as chromogenic reagents, which occurs a sensitive color reaction with indium. In addition, atomic absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical method are also very important analytical methods for micro indium. Among the analytical methods for trace indium, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry have been widely used. Because the content of indium is very low, separation and enrichment of indium become great important before determination of indium. In addition, the methods for direct determination of trace indium have also been reported, but there are only a few reports. The references of every method for indium in different content level were summarized from the aspects of determination methods, conditions, results, etc.

The current-voltage characteristics of the single Fe-porphyrin molecular wires with and without CO adsorption are calculated. The results demonstrate that Fe-porphyrin molecular wire shows a negative differential resistance (NDR) at 2.0 V. The molecular current through Fe-porphyrin is significantly reduced after CO adsorption. Such a significant difference indicates the potential application of Fe-porphyrin as a molecular sensor and/or a molecular switch. The molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian (MPSH) states and transmission coefficients of the single Fe-porphyrin molecular wires with and without CO adsorption are analyzed. It is found that the changes of the MPSH states of the single Fe-porphyrin molecular wires with and without CO adsorption lead to the switching behavior. Furthermore, the transmission coefficients of the single Fe-porphyrin molecular wires with and without CO adsorption under various external voltages are also investigated. The results show that the transmissions through the highest occupied MPSH and the lowest unoccupied MPSH states of the single Fe-porphyrin molecular wire are suppressed significantly at this external voltage of 2.0 V, which causes the NDR. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78650925883	Prediction of association constants of cesium chelates based on Uniform Design Optimized Support Vector Machine	Mushrooms that have demonstrated a high affinity for radiocesium uptake were edible. Humans eating those mushrooms accumulated radiocesium and have been driven by health concerns in recent years. Considering cesium chelates exhibited high stability constant, environmental concentration of radiocesium was diminished by macrocyclic compounds, and the method has been seen as one of the best way to reduce radiocesium pollution. To understand the factors of cesium chelates' stability and predict stability constant value of a new macrocyclic compound, quantitative structure-property relationship studies based on molecular descriptors were presented for building models of cesium chelates. The stability constant, namely the association constant (logK), was correlated with six descriptors by Best Multi-Linear Regression (BMLR), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Uniform Design Optimized Support Vector Machine (UDO-SVM) methods. The correlation coefficients (R) of the best model predicted logK were 0.9332 for the training set and 0.9252 for the test set. This paper provided a novel method that only used chemical structures to develop efficient and stable models for testing and estimating association constants of the cesium chelates. This method will be an experimental guide to find macrocyclic compounds which are used to detect and minimize the radiocesium pollution. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Sodium tetraphenylborate (Na-TPB) is added to precipitate pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin in HAc-NaAc buffer solution (pH = 4.8). After filtering, the excess of TPB in the filtrate was titrated by substituting CTMAB standard solution, which was used instead of poisonous thallous sulfate as titrant. The disappearance of the incision of TPB on dE/dr = f(E) curve was used to indicate the end point of the titration. The method is simple and rapid. It has been applied to the determination of pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin raw materials with satisfactory results. The recovery was from 99.9% to 100.3% and the relative error was less than ± 0.3%. Experiments showed that the method gave the same results as the approach using nonaqueous titration.

Furthermore, copolymerization of SWNTs with PBOpolymer was successfully carried out in a mixed solvent of polyphosphoric acid and methanesulfonic acid. The SWNTs were homogeneously distributed throughout the films of copolymerized products, as determined by Raman spectroscopy. The benzoxazolemoieties could be formed between the carboxyl of SWNTs and o-aminophenol derivatives of PBO polymer. The length of SWNTs affected the dispersion and reaction activity. Short SWNTs could react with the PBO polymer more easily and form more covalent bonds. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84856212833	Kinetic study on hydrolysis and oxidation of formamidine disulfide in acidic solutions	Hydrolysis and oxidation of formamidine disulfide in acidic medium were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) at 25 °C. By controlling the slow reaction rate and choosing appropriate mobile phase, HPLC provides the unique advantages over other methods (UV-Vis, chemical separation) in species tracking and kinetic study. In addition to thiourea and formamidine sulfinic acid, two unreported products were also detected in the hydrolysis reaction. Mass spectrometry measurement indicates these two products to be formamidine sulfenic acid and thiocyanogen with mass weights of 92.28 and 116.36, respectively. In the oxidation of formamidine disulfide by hydrogen peroxide, besides thiourea, formamidine sulfenic acid, formamidine sulfinic acid, thiocyanogen and urea, formamidine sulfonic acid and sulfate could be detected. The oxidation reaction was found to be first order in both formamidine disulfide and hydrogen peroxide. The rate constants of hydrolysis and oxidation reactions were determined in the pH range of 1.5-3.0. It was found both rate constants are increased with the increasing of pH. Experimental curves of different species can be effectively simulated via a mechanism scheme for formamidine disulfide oxidation, including hydrolysis equilibrium of formamidine disulfide and irreversible hydrolysis of formamidine sulfenic acid. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84862799934	First-principles study of the electron transport through conjugated molecular wires with different carbon backbones	The nonequilibrium Green's function approach in combination with density-functional theory is used to perform ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations of the electron transport properties of polyacetylene, polythiophene, poly(phenylene vinylene), poly(p-phenylene ethynylene), and poly(p-phenylene) molecules sandwiched between two gold electrodes. The results demonstrate that the conjugation path has a profound effect on the electron transport property of the molecular wires. Among the five molecular wires, polyacetylene is the most conductive one. The conductivities of the five molecular wires decrease with an order of polyacetylene > polythiophene > poly(phenylene vinylene) > poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) > poly(p-phenylene). The conductivities of polyacetylene and polythiophene are much higher than those of poly(phenylene vinylene), poly(p-phenylene ethynylene), and poly(p-phenylene). The difference of electron transport behaviors of these molecular wires are analyzed in terms of the electronic structures, the transmission spectra, and the spatial distributions of molecular orbitals. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863051553	Synthesis and characterization of the structural and electrochemical properties of Nd-Al codoped amorphous nickel hydroxide	Nd-Al codoped amorphous nickel hydroxide powders were synthesized by microemulsion precipitation method combined with rapid freezing technique. The microstructure of the prepared samples was analyzed with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the prepared samples were characterized with charge/discharge test, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectra. The results showed that the codoping of Nd-Al resulted in more structural defects within the nickel hydroxide. Compared with the Al singly doped amorphous nickel hydroxide, the Nd-Al codoped amorphous nickel hydroxide showed improved electrochemical properties, such as better electrochemical reversibility, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher discharge capacity.

The results show that the molecular current of FeP decreases dramatically after adsorptions of oxygen and carbon monoxide. The molecular current decreases with a order of FeP > FeP+O2 complex > FeP+CO complex. This change of the molecular current after adsorption of oxygen or carbon monoxide can be potentially used to design a molecular sensor or a molecular switch.

84863988127	Theoretical investigations of the effect of vacancies on the geometric and electronic structures of zinc sulfide	The effects of S-vacancy and Zn-vacancy on the geometric and electronic structures of zinc blende ZnS are investigated by the first-principles calculation of the plane wave ultrasoft pseudopotential method based on the density functional theory. The results demonstrate that both S-vacancy and Zn-vacancy decrease the cell volume and induce slight deformation of the perfect ZnS. Furthermore, this change of geometric structure caused by Zn-vacancy is more obvious than the one due to the S-vacancy. The formation energy of S-vacancy is higher than that of Zn-vacancy, indicating that Zn-vacancy is easier to form than S-vacancy in ZnS crystal. Electronic structure analysis shows that Zn-vacancy increases the band-gap of ZnS from 2.03 eV to 2.15 eV, while the S-vacancy has almost no effect on the band-gap of ZnS. Bond population analysis shows that Zn-vacancy increases covalence character of the Zn-S bonds around Zn-vacancy, while S-vacancy shows a relatively weak effect on the covalence character of Zn-S bonds. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84865722500	One-pot preparation and continuous spinning of carbon nanotube/poly(p- phenylene benzobisoxazole) copolymer fibers	Poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers are some of the strongest organic polymer fibers, however, even stronger fibers can be made using carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In the present study, the copolymerization of functionalized CNTs with PBO was successfully carried out by one-pot in situ polycondensation in polyphosphoric acid. Pristine CNTs were first oxidized to CNT-COOH and then modified by 4,6-diaminoresorcinol (DAR) or PBO trimer (DAR-TA-DAR) to improve the reactivity, solubility, dispersivity, and interfacial adhesion of CNTs in polymer matrix. Functionalized CNTs were further covalently incorporated with PBO through in situ polymerization. The chemical structure and morphology of functionalized CNTs and CNT-PBO copolymers were well characterized for confirming the formation of covalent bond between CNTs and PBO. Moreover, continuous CNT-PBO copolymer fibers have been fabricated using a dry-jet wet-spinning technique. The structure and morphology of CNT-PBO copolymer fibers have been characterized and their mechanical and thermal properties have been investigated. The tensile modulus, tensile strength, and thermal stability of CNT-PBO copolymer fibers have been improved. The improvement in PBO molecular chain packing order, the good dispersion and high alignment of CNTs in the PBO matrix, and the covalent bonding at the CNT-PBO interface have been suggested as the main reasons for the performance improvement of PBO. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84867803728	Enhanced cycling performance of Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxide by coating with β-nickel hydroxide	Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxide is modified by coating with pure β-nickel hydroxide in an attempt to improve its cycling performance. The crystal structure and morphology of the prepared samples are examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performances of the bare and the β-nickel hydroxide coated Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxides are characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and charge/discharge tests. The results show that a β-nickel hydroxide coating on Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxide decreases the charge-transfer resistance and increases the specific discharge capacity. In particular, the enhancement of the capacity retention of β-nickel hydroxide coated Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxide is significant, maintaining 92.5% of the maximum capacity after 100 cycles at a charge/discharge rate of 0.5 C, whereas that of bare Al-substituted α-nickel hydroxide is only 53.6%. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The composite inner salts were achieved to improve the dispersivity, solubility, reactivity, and interfacial adhesion of GO in PBO polymer matrix. The structure and morphology of GO-co-PBO copolymer fibers have been characterized. It was demonstrated that GO were covalently incorporated with PBO molecular chains and dispersed considerably well in PBO fiber even the GO reach to 3 wt %. Meanwhile, the tensile modulus, tensile strength and thermal stability of GO-co-PBO copolymer fibers increased considerably with GO. The mechanism and theoretical calculation of GO enhanced PBO fiber were also discussed. The main reasons for the improvement on performance of PBO fiber should be attributed to good dispersion GO in PBO matrix and covalent bonding networks at the interface between GO and PBO molecular chains. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84875478725	Copper nanocrystal modified activated carbon for supercapacitors with enhanced volumetric energy and power density	Copper nanocrystals homogeneously dispersed in activated carbon (AC) were synthesized by an in situ solution-based absorption-reduction method, and the resulting composites were characterized and studied for supercapacitor application. The effects of copper nanocrystals and their content on the electrochemical properties of the obtained AC composites were investigated using multiple techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nitrogen sorption analysis, cyclic voltammetry, galvanic cycling, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results showed that the addition of copper nanocrystals in the AC composites has little effect on the surface area and porosity of AC, and is helpful to reduce its equivalent series resistance, which is favorable to achieve higher charge/discharge rate and improve its power density when used as electrodes for supercapacitors. Copper nanocrystals and the partially oxidized phase CuO act as pseudo-active materials and improve the capacity of the AC composite electrode. The volumetric capacity, energy density, and power density of copper nanocrystal modified activated carbon are much higher than those of AC and AC mechanically mixed with copper particles. Copper nanocrystal modified AC presents a high volumetric capacitance of 62 F cm

84883781228	Synthesis of amphiphilic dextran-poly(lactide) copolymer and their nanoparticles as doxorubicin delivery systems	Novel biodegradable amphiphilic copolymer nanoparticles based on dextran and poly(lactide) have been prepared. To estimate the feasibility as drug carriers, an anti-tumor model drug doxorubicin (DOX) was successfully incorporated into polymeric nanoparticles by double emulsion (DE) and nanoprecipitation (NP) methods. The DOX-loaded nanoparticles were confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrometry. The DOX-loaded nanoparticle size, size distribution and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were influenced by the feed weight ratio of the copolymer to DOX. In addition, in vitro release experiments exhibited the release behavior was affected by pH of release media. The DOX-loaded nanoparticles release slower in pH 7.4 than in pH 5.0 buffer. The dextran-co-PLA polymeric nanoparticles can be useful as drug carriers for anti-tumor drug delivery.

84885374499	Homogenous incorporation of SnO2 nanoparticles in carbon cryogels via the thermal decomposition of stannous sulfate and their enhanced lithium-ion intercalation properties	An impregnation-calcination method based on the thermal decomposition of stannous sulfate is developed to prepare carbon cryogel-tin oxide nanocomposites with less impurity for anode materials of lithium-ion batteries. Structural characterization reveals that the tin oxide nanoparticles, arising from the decomposition of stannous sulfate, are homogeneously distributed inside the pores of carbon cryogels. The detail results demonstrate that carbon cryogels with large specific surface area, large porosity, and small mesopores are beneficial to the deposition of tin oxide nanoparticles. As a result, carbon cryogel-tin oxide nanocomposites with optimized structures show a discharge capacity of 590. mA. h/g after 50 cycles, much higher than that of either carbon cryogels, pure tin oxides or their mechanical mixture. The superior electrochemical properties of carbon cryogel-tin oxide nanocomposites could be attributed to their novel microstructures and the synergistic effects between carbon cryogels and tin oxide. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The feasibility of the selective electrosynthesis of methyl benzaldehyde was discussed. The relation between experimental results(i.e. three methyl benzaldehyde isomer ratio of selective synthesis, current efficiency) and experimental conditions(i.e. xylene mixture concentration, sulfuric acid concentration and the current strength) were explored using radial basis function(RBF) neural network and genetic algorithm(GA)in the electrosynthesis process, and moreover, the prediction model was established. The mean squared error goal(Goal) and the spread of radial basis functions values(Spread) of the RBF neural network in prediction model were optimized by GA. Then electrochemical synthesis conditions, whenever 4-methyl benzaldehyde dominated, 2-methyl benzaldehyde and 4-methyl benzaldehyde dominated, or the current efficiency reached highest, were optimized by GA according to prediction model. In accordance with these conditions, the prediction results of model were given as follow: first, the percent content of 4-methyl benzaldehyde dominated was 90.01%; second, the percent content of 2-methyl benzaldehyde and 4-methyl benzaldehyde dominated was 80.38%; third, the percentage of 2-methyl benzaldehyde, 3-methyl benzaldehyde and 4-methyl benzaldehyde were 16.80%, 8.43% and 74.77%, respectively when the current efficiency reached the highest. The corresponding actual experiment results were 90.10%, 79.91% and 17.20%, 8.49%, 74.31%, respectively. The maximum relative error between prediction results and experiment results was less than ±2.24%. It showed that the model's prediction results were in agreement with experimental results.

84918809022	The complete mitochondrial genome of Neobenedenia melleni (Platyhelminthes: Monogenea): mitochondrial gene content, arrangement and composition compared with two Benedenia species	The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequences of Neobenedenia melleni were determined and compared with those of Benedenia seriolae and B. hoshinai. This circular genome comprises 13,270 bp and includes all 36 typical mt genes found in flatworms. Total AT content of N. melleni is 75.9 %. ATG is the most common start codon, while nad4L is initiated by GTG. All protein-coding genes are predicted to terminate with TAG and TAA. N. melleni has the trnR with a TCG anticodon, which is the same to B. seriolae but different from B. hoshinai (ACG). The mt gene arrangement of N. melleni is similar to that of B. seriolae and B. hoshinai with the exception of three translocations (trnF, trnT and trnG). The overlapped region between nad4L and nad4 was found in the N. melleni mt genome, which was also reported for the published Gyrodactylus species, but it was not found in those of B. seriolae and B. hoshinai, which are non-coding regions instead. The present study provides useful molecular characters for species or strain identification and systematic studies of this parasite.
