0032106040	Clinical use of nonthoracotomy cardioversion-defibrillation system	Objective To summarize our experience in 22 patients who had attempted nonthoracotomy implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) for malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Methods Indications for implantation were ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 17 patients and refractory ventricular tachycardia in 5. Thirteen patients of them had underlying ischaemic heart disease. Seven had dilated cardiomyopathy and two had arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Results 20 out of 22 patients were successfully implanted nonthoracotomic ICD with defibrillating threshold of 16.7 J. The mean hospital stay was 7.8 days. The complications included chest wall haematoma and ventricular lead dislodgment requiring repositioning. In the follow-up period of 10.1 ± 8 months, 6 patients with VA were treated successfully by ICD. Conclusion Nonthoracotomy ICD is possible in a vast majority of patients (91%) and should be considered in all patients requiring ICD without concomitant surgery.

2342466716	Effects of right atrial and ventricular DDD pacing on cardiac function and ventricular contraction synchrony	Background. Right ventricular apical pacing has been reported to reduce cardiac performance. But there are few reports on the effects of dual chamber (DDD) pacing on cardiac function compared to sinus rhythm. In this study, we evaluated the effects of right atrial and ventricular DDD pacing on cardiac function and ventricular contraction synchrony using equilibrium radionuclide angiography. Methods. Ten patients implanted with a right atrial and ventricular DDD pacemaker underwent equilibrium radionuclide angiography. The scintigraphic data were obtained during sinus rhythm and pacing rhythm. Cardiac function parameters were obtained semimanually. Phase analysis was used to study the ventricular activation sequence and ventricular synchrony. Results. The left ventricular 1/3 ejection fraction decreased significantly during pacing compared with that during sinus rhythm[(23.4±6.1)% vs (27.7±4.5)% , P=0.01]. Regional ejection fraction also decreased during pacing, although the difference was not statistically significant. Phase analysis showed that the right ventricle was activated earlier than the left ventricle during pacing, and that the phase shift was significantly greater during pacing than that during sinus rhythm [64.13°±16.80° vs 52.88° ±9.26°, P=0.007]. The activation of both ventricles occurred simultaneously during sinus rhythm, with the activation sequence from proximal septum or base of left ventricle to apex. The earliest activation during pacing occurred at the right ventricular apex, and subsequently spread to the base and left ventricle. Conclusion. Right atrial and ventricular DDD pacing impairs left ventricular systolic function and ventricular synchrony.

33645966544	Complications of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with congestive heart failure	Background: Previous clinical studies have suggested that patients with congestive heart failure and intraventricular conduction delay could benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Implantation of left ventricular lead is a complex procedure with some potential for complications. This study was conducted to analyse the complications of CRT in patients with congestive heart failure. Methods: Totally 117 patients, 86 males and 31 females, mean age of 53 years, with congestive heart failure and intraventricular conduction delaywere enrolled in this study. Venography was performed on all patients. Different types of coronary sinus leads were used to pace the left ventricle. Results: Left ventricular lead was attempted to implant through coronary sinus for all the 117 patients and was successfully implanted in 111 patients. The success rate was 94.9%. Main complications rate was 6.8%, including coronary sinus dissection in 4 patients, phrenic nerve stimulation required lead repositioning in 2 patients and lead dislodgement in 2 patients. Conclusions: It is feasible and safe to pace left ventricle through coronary sinus. However, there are some procedural complications.

33646824338	Incidence and causes of inappropriate detection and therapy by implantable defibrillators of cardioversion in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia	Background: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the only effective therapy in patients with life threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Inappropriate detection and therapy by ICDs are the most common causes of side effects that affect the quality of life in ICD recipients. This study evaluated the incidence and causes of inappropriate detection and therapy by ICDs in patients in our hospital. Methods: From January 2000 to December 2005, fifty patients who received ICD implantation for ventricular arrhythmias for prevention of sudden cardiac death were evaluated in this study. Each ICD was programmed using clinical arrhythmic and cardiac data of the patient before discharge. Patients were followed up by standard schedule after implantation and all data retrieved from each device were collected and saved for further analysis. Results: No arrhythmic event was detected in 12/50 (24%) patients during the period of follow-up. Among the remaining patients, 11 (22%) experienced inappropriate detections and therapies during follow-up in this study. ICD detected 383 ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) and 108 ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes and delivered 678 therapies. In VT group, ICD delivered 413 antitachycardiac pacings (ATPs) and 118 shocks, among which 78 ATPs and 9 shocks were initiated by 55/383 (14.3%) inappropriate detections. In VF group ICD delivered 147 shocks, among which 56 shocks were initiated by 28/108 (26.9%) inappropriate detections. Overall, more than 50% of these episodes were caused by atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response, followed by electromagnetic or myopotential interference. In addition, most inappropriate therapies occurred within one year after ICD implantation. Conclusions: About one fifth of patients experienced ICD inappropriate detection and therapy after implantation. The main cause was AF with rapid ventricular response, followed by electromagnetic or myopotential interference.

33745102327	Impact of automatic threshold capture on pulse generator longevity	Background: The automatic, threshold tracking, pacing algorithm developed by St.Jude Medical, verifies ventricular capture beat by beat by recognizing the evoked response following each pacemaker stimulus. This function was assumed to be not only energy saving but safe. This study estimated the extension in longevity obtained by AutoCapture (AC) compared wit pacemakers programmed to manually optimized, nominal output. Methods: Thirty-four patients who received the St. Jude Affinity series pacemaker were included in the study. The following measurements were taken: stimulation and sensing threshold, impedance of leads, evoked response and polarization signals by 3501 programmer during followup, battery current and battery impedance under different conditions. For longevity comparison, ventricular output was programmed under three different conditions: (1) AC on; (2) AC off with nominal output, and (3) AC off with pacing output set at twice the pacing threshold with a minimum of 2.0 V. Patients were divided into two groups: chronic threshold is higher or lower than 1 V. The efficacy of AC was evaluated. Results: Current drain in the AC on group, AC off with optimized programming or nominal output was (14.33 ± 2.84) mA, (16.74 ± 2.75) mA and (18.4 ± 2.44) mA, respectively (AC on or AC off with optimized programming vs. nominal output, P <0.01). Estimated longevity was significantly extended by AC on when comparedwith nominal setting [(103±27) months, (80±24) months, P < 0.01). Furthermore, compared with the optimized programming, AC extends the longevity when the pacing threshold is higher than 1 V. Conclusion: AC could significantly prolong pacemaker longevity; especially in the patient with high pacing threshold. ©2005-2008 Chinese Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

33749049956	Short-term effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with ischaemic or nonischaemic cardiomyopathy	Background: Patients with heart failure were candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) regardless of underlying aetiology. This study observed the effect of CRT in patients with ischaemic or nonischaemic cardiomyopathy. Methods: One hundred and forty-two patients with refractory chronic heart failure and left bundle branch block received cardiac resynchronization therapy, 91 men and 51 women, average age 60 years, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was severely depressed (mean 29%), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) enlarged (mean 72 mm) and QRS width was lengthened (mean 147 ms). Ninety-eight had nonischaemic cardiomyopathy and 44 had ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Results: After cardiac resynchronization therapy, the heart function was significantly improved. The mean LVEF increased from 29% to 36% after pacing. In patients with nonischaemic cardiomyopathy, the LVEF was improved from 28% to 37%, and in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the LVEF was improved from 30% to 36%. No significant difference of the improvement was found between the two groups (P>0.05). Conclusions: Cardiac resynchronization therapy could significantly improve cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure regardless of the underlying heart disease.

33845911708	Effect of nifekalant on acute electrical remodelling in rapid atrial pacing canine model	Background: Nifekalant may prevent atrial fibrillation (AF) and possibly be useful in treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmia in patients with severe heart failure. This study investigated the electophysiologic effect of nifekalant on the acute atrial remodeling in rapid atrial pacing (RAP) model of canine. Methods: Twelve mongrel dogs subjected to rapid stimulation (400 beats/ min) at left atrial appendage (LAA) for 24 hours, were randomized into the control group (rapid pacing only, n=6) and the nifekalant group (intravenous nifekalant therapy immediately after RAP, n=6). Atrial, electrophysiological parameters were measured in right atrium, coronary sinus, LAA, posterior wall of left atrium (PWLA) and left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), before and after the RAP. Results: In the control group, the effective refractory periods (ERP) were shortened greatly at all sites, paced dogs had substantially shorter ERPs in the high right atrium, LAA, and LSPV, but fewer changes in the PWLA, the coefficient variation of ERP (COV ERP) was increased significantly. After rapid atrial stimulation, the inducibility of AF increased significantly [induction number: pre-RAP vs post-RAP, 1.00±0.89 vs 8.17±2.79, P<0.01; duration of AF: pre-RAP vs post-RAP, (450.34±362.59) ms vs (9975.77±4376.99) ms, P<0.01]. In the nifekalant group, although the ERPs were prolonged at all sites compared with those in pre-RAP state, only the value at LSPV differed significantly from that in pre-RAP state [pre-RAP vs post-RAP, (102.50±5.24) ms vs (132.51±5.20) ms, P<0.01]; the COV ERP did not change statistically in this group. The inducibility of AF slightly increased but insignificantly after pacing [induction number: pre-RAP vs post-RAP, 0.83±0.75 vs 1.67 ±0.82, P=0.19; duration of AF: pre-RAP vs post-RAP, (378.67±317.88) ms vs (1124.08±1109.77) ms, P=0.06]. Conduction time values did not alter significantly in either of the two groups after RAP. Conclusions: In canine RAP model, nifekalant inhibited ERP shortening and ERP heterogeneity increasing, decreased AF induction. Nifekalant can reverse acute electrical remodeling effect in this model.

33947362000	Prevalence of dyssynchrony derived from echocardiographic criteria in heart failure patients with normal or prolonged QRS duration	Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure is targeted at specific patients with mechanical dyssynchrony. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dyssynchrony in heart failure patients with either normal or prolonged QRS duration using Doppler imaging. Sixty heart failure patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (30 with prolonged QRS duration 30 with normal QRS duration) underwent standard echocardiography and tissue Doppler imaging examinations. Difference between left and right ventricular pre-ejection intervals of more than 40 msec was considered a marker of interventricular dyssynchrony. Intraventricular dyssynchrony was defined as a delay of 60 msec between the time to peak velocities of the septum and left ventricular lateral wall. Patients who have either intra- or interventricular dyssynchrony were defined as with cardiac dyssynchrony. Dyssynchrony was observed in 7 (23.3%) heart failure patients with normal QRS duration versus 26 (86.7%) patients with prolonged QRS duration. There was significant difference between the prevalence of dyssynchrony derived from echo criteria in two groups (P<0.05). Although patients with prolonged QRS duration have a high prevalence of dyssynchrony, yet some still have good cardiac synchronicity. Moreover, dyssynchrony also exists in a small percentage of heart failure patients with normal QRS duration. To identify the potential responders for CRT, both QRS duration and cardiac synchronicity should be assessed. © 2007, the Authors.

34247113286	Radiofrequency ablation of the ventricular tachycardia with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy using non-contact mapping	Background: Intracardiac non-contact mapping provides a rapid and accurate isopotential mapping that facilitates catheter ablation of the ventricular tachyarrhythmias in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients (26 men and 6 women, mean 37.2 ± 13.8 years) were treated with ablation. Fourteen patients had a history of syncope/pre-syncope. Two patients had an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) previously implanted. Results: There were 67 ventricular tachycardias (VTs) induced in the 32 patients. The average VT rate was 210 ± 32.2 (130-310) bpm. There were 42 episodes of VT that had a heart rate ≥200 bpm and 24 of the 32 patients (75%) had ≥2 morphologies of VT. Regional ablation was applied by targeting the earliest VT activation sites under the guidance of non-contact mapping. Acute success was achieved in 84.4% (27/32) patients, and significant improvement was seen in 15.6% (5/32) patients as evidenced by a slower rate of VT. None of the patients experienced syncope/pre-syncope or sudden death during the 28.6 ± 16 (9-72) month follow-up. There were no complications of the procedure. At the end of follow-up, 81.3% of the patients were free of VT without medication while the rest of the patients achieved a modified success. Conclusions: The rapid ventricular tachyarrhythmias in ARVC patients can be abolished or improved significantly by regional RF catheter ablation under the guidance of non-contact mapping. There was no sudden cardiac arrest or death in those patients without ICD implantation. Delayed efficacy may occur in some patients after ablation. © 2007, The Authors.

84867435150	Home monitoring system improves the detection of ventricular arrhythmia and inappropriate shock	Background The impact of home monitoring system in the early detection of ventricular arrhythmia and inappropriate shock in daily work is not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of home monitoring system on the early detection of ventricular arrhythmia and inappropriate shock in daily clinical practice. Methods Cases of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation with or without the home monitoring system from June 2010 to October 2011 at our center were reviewed. Follow-up was scheduled after implantation. Data relating to the home monitoring ICD were retrieved using a remote transmitter system. Data relating to the other devices were obtained during scheduled follow-up or unscheduled visits. Results Our study involved 69 patients (mean age (68.4±17.6) years, 64.3% males, 26 in the home monitoring group vs. 43 in the non-home monitoring group). In all, 561 ventricular arrhythmia episodes were detected in 17 patients (39.5%) in the non-home monitoring group: 495 episodes were ventricular tachycardia and 66 episodes were ventricular fibrillation; among these, 476 episodes of ventricular tachycardia and 45 episodes of ventricular fibrillation were appropriately diagnosed (96.1% and 68.2%, respectively). In the home monitoring group, 389 ventricular arrhythmia episodes were transmitted by the home monitoring system in nine patients (34.6%): 348 ventricular tachycardia episodes and 41 ventricular fibrillation episodes. Device detection was appropriate in 348 ventricular tachycardia episodes (100.0%) and 36 ventricular fibrillation episodes (87.8%). The home monitoring group showed a higher appropriate detection rate of ventricular tachycardia (P <0.01) and ventricular fibrillation (P=0.02). The proportion of inappropriate shock was comparable in the two groups (6/11 in the non-home monitoring group vs. 1/7 in the home monitoring group; P=0.08). Conclusions The home monitoring ICD was able to provide information relating to inappropriate detection and shock earlier than conventional devices. It proved to be a reliable tool and has a strong potential to provide greater reaction time in the case of inappropriate shock.

84887577410	Reduction of atrial fibrillation in remotely monitored pacemaker patients: Results from a Chinese multicentre registry	Background Many recipients of implantable cardiac electronic devices have atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrences after device implantation, even if there is no previous history of AF, and some of the episodes are asymptomatic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in AF burden following early AF detection in patients treated with pacemakers equipped with automatic, daily Home Monitoring function. Methods Between February 2009 and December 2010, the registry recruited 701 pacemaker patients (628 dual-chamber, 73 biventricular devices) at 97 clinical centers in China. Daily Home Monitoring data transmissions were analyzed to screen for the AF burden. In-office follow-ups were scheduled for 3 and 6 months after implantation. Upon first AF (i.e., mode-switch) detection in a patient, screening of AF burden by Home Monitoring was extended for the next 180 days. Results At least one episode of AF was observed in 22.9% of patients with dual-chamber pacemakers and in 28.8% of patients with biventricular pacemakers. The first AF detection in a patient occurred, on average, about 2 months before scheduled follow-up visits. In both pacemaker groups, mean AF burden decreased significantly (P<0.05) over 180 days following first AF detection: from 12.0% to 2.5% in dual-chamber and from 12.2% to 0.5% in biventricular pacemaker recipients. The number of patients with an AF burden >10% per month was significantly reduced over 6 months of implantation in both dual chamber (38 patients in the first month vs. 21 patients in month 6, P<0.05) and biventricular (7 patients in the first month vs. 0 patient in months 4-6, P<0.05) pacemaker recipients. Conclusions Automatic, daily Home Monitoring of patients treated with cardiac pacemakers allows early detection of AF, and there is a gradual and significant decrease in AF burden.

84897054349	Comparison of the Prevalence, Clinical Features, and Long-term Outcomes of Midventricular Hypertrophy vs Apical Phenotype in Patients With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy	Background: Previous studies on the association between the distribution of left ventricle hypertrophy and the clinical features of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have yielded unclear results. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in the prevalence, clinical features, management strategies, and long-term outcomes between patients with midventricular hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (MVHOCM) and patients with apical HCM (ApHCM). Methods: A retrospective study of 60 patients with MVHOCM and 263 patients with ApHCM identified in a consecutive single-centre cohort consisting of 2068 patients with HCM was performed. The prevalence, clinical features, and natural history of the patients in these 2 groups were compared. Results: Compared with ApHCM patients, patients with MVHOCM tended to be much younger and more symptomatic during their initial evaluation. Over a mean follow-up of 7 years, the probability of cardiovascular mortality and that of morbidity was significantly greater in MVHOCM patients compared with ApHCM patients (log-rank, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest that, compared with ApHCM, MVHOCM represents an uncommon presentation of the clinical spectrum of HCM that is characterized by progressive clinical deterioration leading to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Our results also underscore the importance of the timely recognition of MVHOCM for the prediction of prognosis and the early consideration of appropriate management strategies. © 2014 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

67249104954	Improvement of P wave dispersion after cardiac resynchronization therapy for heart failure	Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on P wave maximum duration (PWM) and P wave dispersion (PWD) in patients with advanced heart failure. Methods: Forty-six patients (33 men; mean age, 60 ± 11 years) with CRT were enrolled in the present study. PWM and PWD were measured using 12-lead surface electrocardiography (ECG) at a paper speed of 50 mm/s and 20 mm/mV. Serial ECG, echocardiography, clinical assessment, and device interrogations were performed at baseline and 3 months after CRT. Results: After 3 months of follow-up, PWM and PWD values were significantly decreased (129.6 ± 11.3 to 120.7 ± 10.7 milliseconds, P < .001; 42.6 ± 8.0 to 32.3 ± 10.1 milliseconds; P < .001, respectively). It showed a significant reduction in left atrial diameter (LAD) (46.5 ± 5.2 to 44.9 ± 5.6 mm, P = .021) and an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (29.0% ± 7.5% to 36.2% ± 8.0%, P < .001). The decrease of PWM and PWD was positively correlated with the reduction of LAD and negatively correlated with the improvement of LVEF. The reduction in atrial fibrillation burden was observed after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Cardiac resynchronization therapy decreases PWM and PWD along with an improvement of LVEF and a reduction of LAD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical implications of decrease of PWD on prevention of atrial fibrillation. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

67349103349	Electrocardiographic alterations after chronic right ventricular apical pacing in patients with sinus node dysfunction	Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to induce electrical remodeling by chronic right ventricular apical (RVA) in patients with sinus node dysfunction. Methods: Ninety-two patients with sinus node dysfunction who underwent initial pacemaker implantation were included in the study. During routine clinic visits, electrocardiograms and echocardiograms were recorded. Forty-five patients were also studied as controls. Results: During a mean follow-up time of 3.3 ± 0.5 years, the intrinsic QRS duration increased from 87 ± 9 milliseconds before device implantation to 94 ± 10 milliseconds (P < .001). The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter increased from 46 ± 3 to 50 ± 4 mm (P < .001), and the left ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 63% ± 4% to 57% ± 5% (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that elderly age at the time of pacemaker implantation (odds ratio [OR], 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-10.90; P = .04), RVA pacing (OR, 3.91; 95% CI, 1.10-13.89; P = .03), and coronary artery disease (OR, 7.33; 95% CI, 1.09-50.29; P = .04) were independent predictors of the prolongation of intrinsic QRS duration. Conclusions: The present study indicated that chronic RVA pacing may lead to a prolongation of intrinsic QRS duration, which could be independently predicted by elderly age, chronic RVA pacing, and the presence of coronary artery disease. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67649786631	Decrease of plasma N-terminal pro β-type natriuretic peptide as a predictor of clinical improvement after cardiac resynchronization therapy for heart failure	Background: N-terminal pro β-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro BNP) has been shown to predict the prognosis and could guide the treatment of heart failure. We aimed to investigate the values of NT pro BNP in predicting the clinical response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Methods: A total of 44 patients with chronic heart failure (34 male and 10 female, mean age of (58±13) years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3.3±0.5, QRS duration (150±14) milliseconds) who underwent successful implantation of a CRT system were enrolled in this study. Pharmacotherapy remained stable during the first 3 months of follow-up. Plasma levels of NT pro BNP were evaluated before and 3 months after implantation. Clinical, echocardiographic and exercise parameters were monitored at each clinical visit after CRT implantation. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and a paired t test were performed to analyze the data. Results: After a mean of (16.3±5.5) months of follow-up, 11 nonresponders were identified. CRT resulted in a significant reduction in NT pro BNP ((1.70±1.28) vs (1.07±0.88) pmol/ml, P <0.001) in responders. Percentage change in NT pro BNP level (ΔBNP%) was a statistically significant predictor of long term clinical improvement at 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions ΔBNP% from baseline to 3 months of follow-up is a predictor of long term response to CRT. NT pro BNP may be a simple method for monitoring the effects of CRT.

68249154738	Prognostic factors affecting the all-cause death and sudden cardiac death rates of post myocardial infarction patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction	Background: Post myocardial infarction (post-MI) patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) have been candidates for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) since the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trail II (MADIT II). However, due to the high costs of ICDs, widespread usage has not been accepted. Therefore, further risk stratification for post-MI patients with low LVEF may aid in the selection of patients that will benefit most from ICD treatment. Methods: Four hundred and seventeen post-MI patients with low LVEF (≤35%) were enrolled in the study. All the patients received standard examination and proper treatment and were followed up to observe the all-cause death rate and sudden cardiac death (SCD) rate. Then COX proportional-hazards regression model was used to investigate the clinical factors which affect the all-cause death rate and SCD rate. Results: Of 55 patients who died during (32±24) months of follow-up, 37 (67%) died suddenly. After adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, multivariate COX proportional-hazards regression model identified the following variables associated with death from all causes: New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure class ≥III (Hazard ratio: 2.361), LVEF ≤20% (Hazard ratio: 2.514), sustained ventricular tachycardia (Hazard ratio: 6.453), and age ≥70 years (Hazard ratio: 3.116). The presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia (Hazard ratio: 6.491) and age ≥70 years (Hazard ratio: 2.694) were specifically associated with SCD. Conclusions: In the post-MI patients with low LVEF, factors as LVEF ≤20%, age ≥70 years, presence of ventricular tachycardia, and NYHA heart failure class ≥III predict an adverse outcome. The presence of sustained ventricular tachycardia and age ≥70 years was associated with occurrence of SCD in these patients.

70249091781	C-reactive protein and atrial fibrillation in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy	Background: Previous studies have found elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Most of these studies included AF patients with various heart diseases, but few studies were designed to investigate CRP in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) patients with AF. Method and Results: CRP levels in 242 IDCM patients with AF were compared with CRP levels in 280 control IDCM patients. Among control patients, 70 had atrial premature beats or atrial tachycardia and 210 had normal sinus rhythm. CRP was higher in the AF group than in the control group (median, 4.59 versus 2.81 mg/L; p<0.001). The prevalence of AF in IDCM patients increased as plasma CRP levels increased, and the patients with the highest plasma CRP levels had the highest probability of suffering from AF. Outcome of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed body mass index, AF, and white blood cell count significantly correlated with the plasma CRP levels. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that the plasma CRP level in IDCM patients with AF was higher than in IDCM patients without AF, and an increase in plasma CRP levels was associated with an increased prevalence of AF in IDCM patients. Also, body mass index, AF, and white blood cell count correlate with plasma CRP levels in IDCM patients. These data suggest there is presence of inflammation in IDCM patients with AF. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

70349472807	Perioperative anticoagulation for patients with mechanic heart valve(s) undertaking pacemaker implantation	AimsThis study was to evaluate perioperative anticoagulation therapy in patients with mechanic heart valve(s) undergoing pacemaker implantation.Methods and reslutsA total of 109 patients with mechanical heart valve(s) undertaking pacemaker implantation were studied. Fifty-one patients with warfarin suspended 3 days before surgery were classified into Group 1 and 58 patients with warfarin suspended <3 days or not at all into Group 2. The perioperative incidence of complications was compared. Suspension of warfarin <3 days before surgery was associated with a higher incidence of excessive haemorrhage (16/51 vs. 5/58, P = 0.003). Patients with pocket haematoma were more likely to have been treated with post-operation heparin (60 vs. 17.3, P = 0.032). In 42 patients treated with proposed protocol of perioperative anticoagulation, no pocket haematoma or embolism occurred.ConclusionsA minimum of 3 days cessation of warfarin prior to surgery is preferred. Low-molecular-weight heparin should not be used for at least 3 days post-surgery. We propose that the protocol of perioperative anticoagulation be a suspension of warfarin not <3 days with low-molecular-weight heparin bridging stopped 12 h before surgery, and warfarin rather than low-molecular-weight heparin initiated immediately after surgery.

77956103917	Nifekalant hydrochloride terminating sustained ventricular tachycardia accompanied with QT dispersion prolongation	Background: Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation are the main reasons causing sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the effects of nifekalant hydrochloride (NIF) on QT dispersion (QTd) in treating VT. Methods: A total of 16 consecutive patients suffered sustained VT was included and then randomly divided into two groups according to the administration duration of NIF. In long-time group (group L), patients were injected with NIF continuously for at least 12 hours after a bolus dose. The patients in short-time group (group S) were injected with NIF just for 1 hour. Results: There were 7 of all 10 episodes of VT which were terminated by NIF, including 4 episodes in group L were stopped over 1 hour after continuous infusion of NIF. One patient suffered from torsade de pointes. Electrocardiography analysis indicated that QTd was significantly decreased 12 hours after stopping of infusing NIF compared with that when VT stopped ((45.4±22.1) ms vs. (73.4±33.2) ms, P <0.01), and the corrected QTd (QTcd) decreased too ((47.8±22.9) ms vs. (78.3±36.5) ms, P <0.01). There was a positive correlation between the increase in QTd and dose of administrating NIF (P <0.01), so was QTcd (P <0.01). Conclusions: More administration of NIF indicates higher terminating rate of VT and more QTd prolongation. However, the safety is acceptable if several important issues were noticed in using NIF, such as serum potassium concentration, stopping side-effect related agents, and carefully observing clinical responses.

78649648135	Preimplant left ventricular end-diastolic dimension and body weight independently associate with paced QRS duration in patients receiving right ventricular apical pacing for complete atrioventricular block	Background: Paced QRS duration, a good marker of ventricular asynchrony while pacing, has been accepted as a valuable predictor of new-onset heart failure in patients receiving right ventricular apical pacing. But nowadays we have little evidence for predicting paced QRS duration before the implantation. Hypothesis: There might be relationships between paced QRS duration and demographic characteristics, clinical features such as comorbidities, native QRS duration, or preimplant cardiac size. The purpose of this article was to identify potential predictors of paced QRS duration in patients receiving right ventricular apical pacing for complete atrioventricular block. Methods: One hundred seventy patients with right ventricular apical pacing for complete atrioventricular block were divided into 2 groups according to whether the paced QRS duration was longer than 170 ms or not. Demographic characteristics, clinical features, electrocardiogram and echocardiography before implantation, and electrocardiogram immediately after implantation, were retrospectively recorded. Results: Preimplant left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD) and body weight were found to be independently associated with the paced QRS duration. Although both of them had low sensitivity and specificity in predicting paced QRS duration longer than 170 ms, the specificity could increase to 81.2% when they were combined. Conclusions: Both preimplant LVEDD and body weight independently associate with paced QRS duration in patients receiving apical pacing for complete atrioventricular block. Although whether they really have an effect on new-onset heart failure still needs to be verified, and these findings might be a good indication. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

78649233266	Factors influencing survival of patient with in-hospital ventricular fibrillation: Experience of a single center	Objective: To evaluate the factors influencing the outcome of patients who suffered in-hospital ventricular fibrillation (IHVF). Methods: Data of patients with IHVF in a single center were collected. Clinical characteristics of patients were compared between those survived (n=112) and those died (n=94), and those with IHVF occurred in inpatient ward and in emergency center. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with survival. Results: There were 206 events in the analysis. The most common underlying disease was coronary artery disease (CAD), especially acute myocardial infarction (AMI). On multiple logistic regression analysis, independent predictors for failure to survive were higher NYHA class (odds ratio 1.7,95% CI, 1.3-2.2, P< 0.001), lower serum potassium concentration ([K

78649271762	Does electrophysiological testing have any role in risk stratification for sudden cardiac death?	It is current practice that ICD implantation is indicated in patients with a low LVEF. Other risk factors are to be sought to increase the cost-effectiveness of ICD for primary prevention of SCD. EP testing can be used for risk stratification for SCD in patients with CAD. This may improve predictive accuracy in patients stratified using other risk factors, including a low LVEF. Based on the data from MADITT II and MUSTT trials, it is class I indication for ICD implantation in patients with nonsustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF <40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at EP testing.

79151484347	Adiponectin inhibits lymphotoxin-β receptor-mediated NF-κB signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Adiponectin exerts anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenesis properties through its 2 receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2). However, the signaling pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of adiponectin are largely unknown. In this study, we identified the lymphotoxin (LT)-β receptor (LTBR) as an interacting partner of human AdipoR1 by using a yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction between LTBR and AdipoR1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analysis. Furthermore, adiponectin incubation inhibited lymphotoxin-induced NF-κB activation and the expression of adhesion molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. These results indicated that AdipoR1 interacted with LTBR and mediated the inhibition of LTBR-activated NF-κB pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79955934165	Potential predictors of non-response and super-response to cardiac resynchronization therapy	Background Although cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is already an established treatment, the characteristics of patients who have an excellent response to CRT and those who get no benefit remain to be determined. The purpose of this study was to search for potential predictors of both non-response and super-response to CRT. Methods Seventy-six consecutive patients who received CRT treatment were divided into group A (non-responders), group C (super-responders) and group B (responders exclusive of super-responders). Student's t test, Mann-Whitney test, Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve were employed to identify potential predictors among the patients' demographic characteristics, clinical features, several electrocardiographic parameters before and after CRT implantation, and their pre-implant echocardiographic parameters. Results Group A had the lowest 3-month left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Group C had the smallest pre-implant left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), the shortest post-implant QRS duration, the smallest 3-month LVEDD and the highest 3-month LVEF. In addition, there was a trend of gradual change in percent of left bundle branch block, severity of pre-implant mitral regurgitation, pre-implant QRS dispersion, post-implant QRS duration as well as post-implant QRS dispersion from group A to group B and from group B to group C. Multivariable Logistic analysis revealed that only pre-implant LVEDD could predict CRT super-response. A pre-implant LVEDD of 68.5 mm was the cut-off value that identified super-responders with 87.5% sensitivity and 79.7% specificity. A pre-implant LVEDD of 62.5 mm identified super-responders with 50.0% sensitivity and 89.8% specificity. Conclusions Predictors of a CRT non-response remain unclear at present. But it is credible that patients with a smaller left ventricle would have a better chance to become super-responders to CRT.

79960660464	Single center experience with intrathoracic impedance monitoring in chronic heart failure patients	Background The Medtronic InSync Sentry is the first available cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) which can monitor fluid status by measuring intrathoracic impedance. This study was designed to observe the effectiveness of intrathoracic impedance monitoring on detecting aggravation of heart failure. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 14 consecutive patients. Patients were regularly followed up every 3-6 months after the implantation. At each visit, interrogation of the device was done. Patients were instructed to inform the researcher on hearing the device alert, and to take extra 40 milligrams of furosemidum if they had aggravated symptoms later. If the symptoms could not be relieved, they were asked to see a doctor. Data about heart failure hospitalization were collected from the medical record. Results During 18-48 months follow-up, a total of 7 patients encountered 28 alert events. On one hand, alert events appeared before all deteriorated symptoms and heart failure hospitalizations. On the other hand, there were 23 alerts followed by deterioration of heart failure symptoms, and 2 alerts related to 2 hospitalizations caused by pulmonary infection in one patient. Only 5 patients were hospitalized 10 times for deterioration of cardiac function. Conclusion The function of intrathoracic impedance monitoring is reliable in predicting deterioration of heart failure.

84855365336	Impact of myocardial scarring on outcomes of cardiac resynchronization therapy: Extent or location?	Refining the criteria for patient selection for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may improve its outcomes. The study objective was to determine the effect of scar location, scar burden, and left ventricular (LV) lead position on CRT outcomes. Methods: The study included 213 consecutive CRT recipients with radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging before CRT between January 2002 and December 2008. Scar localization and myocardial viability were analyzed using a 17-segment model and a 5-point semiquantitative scale. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and echocardiography were assessed before and after CRT. The anatomic LV lead location in the 17-segment model was assessed by review of fluoroscopic cinegrams in right and left anterior oblique views. As in published studies, clinical response was defined as an absolute improvement in LV ejection fraction of $5 percentage points after CRT. Results: A total of 651 scar segments was identified in 213 patients. Eighty-three percent of scar segments were located in the LV anterior, posterior, septal, and apical regions, whereas 84% of LV leads were in the lateral wall. Only 11% of LV leads were positioned in scar segments. The extent of scarring was significantly higher in nonresponders than in responders (18.0% vs. 6%, P = 0.001). Compared with patients with scarring >22%, patients ≤70 y with scarring ≤22% of the left ventricle had a greater increase in LV ejection fraction (10.1% ± 10.5% vs. 0.8% ± 6.1%; P = 0.001) and improvement in NYHA class (-0.9 ± 0.7 vs. -0.5 ± 0.8; P = 0.02). Conclusion: LV leads were often located in viable myocardial regions. Less scar burden was associated with a greater improvement in heart failure but only in relatively younger CRT recipients.

84857031074	Cardiac resynchronization therapy: Do women benefit more than men?	Gender and Resynchronization Therapy. Introduction: Women are underrepresented in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) trials. Whether there is a gender difference in the benefit derived from CRT has not been well studied. Methods: This study included 728 consecutive CRT recipients at our institution who met guidelines for placement of a CRT device. Clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were collected at baseline and after CRT; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed using a national death and location database. The effects and outcome of CRT were compared between women and men. Results: Of 728 patients, 166 were female (22.8%). Female patients were younger than male patients (66.0 ± 11.9 years vs 69.4 ± 10.9 years; P < 0.001) and more often had nonischemic cardiomyopathy (68% vs 36%; P < 0.001). Both female and male patients had significantly improved clinical and echocardiographic parameters after CRT. The magnitude of improvement was similar in women and men, except that improvement in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class was greater in women than in men (-0.79 ± 0.78 vs -0.56 ± 0.85; P = 0.009). Although women were at lower risk of death than men after CRT (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.75; P < 0.001, unadjusted), multivariate analysis indicated gender was not, but age at CRT placement, cardiomyopathy cause, NYHA class, and lead location were independent predictors of survival. Conclusion: Female CRT recipients seem to achieve greater survival benefit than male recipients. However, this benefit is majorly driven by nonischemic cardiomyopathy and other clinical factors. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84862247850	Improvement of P-wave dispersion is associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation after cardiac resynchronization therapy	Background: P-wave dispersion (PWD) is a useful predictor of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). The effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on PWD and the prognostic implications of the improvement in PWD remain undefined. The aim of the study was to explore the clinical significance of the improvement of PWD after CRT. Methods: Electrocardiographic studies were performed before and three months after CRT in 81 patients (57 men and 24 women; age (60.5±11.2) years) with standard CRT indication but no history of AF. A significant improvement of PWD (PWD responder) was defined as a relative decrease >20% from baseline PWD. The primary endpoints were new-onset AF detected by electrocardiogram (ECG) or CRT. Results: After (30.6±7.5) months of follow-up, PWD responders (n=43) had a significantly lower incidence of AF than did PWD nonresponders, 12% vs. 29% (P <0.001). In Cox proportional hazard analysis, PWD responders was the only predictor of lower risk of new-onset AF (HR 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.96, P=0.033). Conclusion: Improvement of P-wave dispersion after CRT was associated with a lower incidence of AF, which may be related to the significant improvement in left ventricular systolic function and the reverse modeling of the left atrium.

84862899611	Human leukocyte antigen-DQ beta 1 chain (DQB1) gene polymorphisms are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Background: Previous studies reported an association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ antigen beta 1 chain (DQB1) alleles and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the results of those studies have been inconsistent. To clarify the association between HLA-DQB1 and DCM, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies. Methods: Searches were performed using the PubMed database, the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, the Science Citation Index database, the China Biology Medicine disc, the China National Knowledge Information database, the Wanfang database, and the Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database (VIP database). The search terms included "dilated cardiomyopathy" and "DQB1." Ten case-controlled studies were included in the systematic review to assess the association between DCM and the HLA-DQB1*0201, *0302, *0504, *0301, and *0602 alleles. Results: In total, 8 studies were included in the meta-analysis of the HLA-DQB1 *0201 allele. The pooled odds risk (OR) for this allele was .47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of .28 to .77 (P < .01). With respect to the HLA-DQB1 *0504 allele, only 3 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled OR was .36 (95% CI, .15 to .84; P < .05). Nine, 8, and 7 studies of the HLA-DQB1 *0301, *0302, and *0602 alleles, respectively, were included in our meta-analysis. No statistically significant difference was evident in the frequency of these 3 alleles between the DCM and normal control groups. Conclusion: The HLA-DQB1 *0201 and *0504 alleles may be protective against DCM. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84863080766	A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of an intracardiac electrogram-based atrioventricular and interventricular intervals optimization method in cardiac resynchronization therapy	Background Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing improves cardiac function, functional capacity and quality of life in selected patients with heart failure. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the intracardiac electrogram (IEGM)-based optimization method, QuickOpt™, in Chinese patients treated with CRT. Methods: Aortic time velocity integrals (AVTI) achieved at the sensed atrioventricular (AV), paced AV and interventricular (VV) interval settings recommended by both QuickOpt™ and standard echocardiographic optimization were measured in 101 patients. Consistency and the strength of the relationship between the two timing cycle optimization methods were assessed by intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The ICC showed good agreement and correlation with what the AVTI achieved at the optimal sensed AV (ICC=0.9683 (0.9535-0.9785)), paced AV (ICC=0.9642 (0.9475-0.9757)) and VV (ICC=0.9730 (0.9602-0.9817)) interval settings determined by the two optimization methods. The average time required by echocardiographic optimization and by QuickOpt™ were (78.32±32.40) minutes and (1.98±1.64) minutes respectively (P <0.0001). Conclusion: The QuickOpt™ algorithm provides a quicker, simpler and reliable alternative to the standard method for timing cycle optimization. (ClinicalTrial.gov Reference Number: NCT00918294).

84863875724	The Prognostic Significance of Fragmented QRS in Patients With Left Ventricular Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy	Background: Fragmented QRS complexes (fQRS) were proven to be associated with the prognosis of several heart diseases. However, no data is available regarding fQRS in left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC), in which the outcome varies greatly and a simple yet practicable prognostic predictor is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic value of fQRS in LVNC patients. Methods: Sixty-four LVNC patients were evaluated. Fragmented narrow QRS (f-nQRS) included single or multiple notches in the R or S wave in at least 2 contiguous electrocardiogram (ECG) leads and QRS duration ≤ 120 ms, fragmented wide QRS (f-wQRS) included more than 2 notches and QRS duration ≥ 120 ms. Results: f-nQRS and f-wQRS was present in 24 (38%) and 7 (11%) patients respectively. During follow-up, 13 patients died and 7 patients underwent heart transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that compared with the non-f-nQRS group, the f-nQRS group associated with a significantly lower survival (P = 0.005). The f-wQRS group also demonstrated a substantially lower survival as compared with the non-f-wQRS group (P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis indicated fnQRS was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HR: 5.33; P = 0.045). Conclusions: In LVNC patients, the presence of f-nQRS has significant prognostic value and may provide a valid method of risk stratification. © 2012 Canadian Cardiovascular Society.

84866262304	Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation with fragmented QRS complex and J wave in resting electrocardiogram	Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics of idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) with fragmented QRS complex (f-QRS) and J wave in resting electrocardiogram. Methods: We reviewed data from 21 case subjects in our hospital who were resuscitated after cardiac arrest due to IVF and assessed the prevalence of f-QRS and J wave in resting electrocardiogram (ECG). All the case subjects were classified among three groups based on the electrocardiographic morphology: group I, both f-QRS and J wave were observed (n = 6), group II, only J wave was observed (n = 9), group III, neither f-QRS nor J wave was observed (n = 6). Population characteristics, history of syncope or sudden cardiac arrest, incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF), and circumstance of VF were evaluated among the three groups. Results: The incidence of index events (syncope, survived cardiac arrest and VF episodes recorded in implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or pacemakers) was 13.4 ± 5.6 per-year in group I, 10.8 ± 3.9 per-year in group II, and 9.8 ± 4.2 per-year in group III. There were significant differences in incidences among the three groups, the most frequent index events were observed in group I. The hazard ratio for incidence was 3.2 (95%CI, 1.1-7.9; P = 0.01). The history and circumstance of the index events were different among the groups. In group I, all the index events occurred during sleep in early morning. In group II, four subjects suffered VF during strenuous physical activities or agitation state, two during sleep in early morning, three in usual activity. In group III, one subject suffered VF during sleep in early morning, one in agitation state, four in usual activity. Conclusions: This study suggests that the IVF patients with the combined appearance of f-QRS and J wave in the resting ECG suffer an increased risk of VF, this subgroup of IVF patients has a unique clinical feature. ©2012 JGC All rights reserved.

0039180021	Transvenous pectoral implantation of single lead implantable cardioverter defibrillator	Objective To report our initial experience of transveneous pectoral implantation of single lead implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in fifteen patients. Methods Fifteen patients (male 13, female 2, mean age of 51.7 years), including dilated cardiomyopathy in 4, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 2, coronary artery disease in 5 and syncope of unknown etiology in 2, underwent ICD implantation. Indications for ICD implantation were ventricular fibrillation (8 patients) and refractory ventricular tachycardia (7 patients). All patients had syncope out of hospital. The ICD system were Medtronic Jewel active can in 5 patients (Model 7219C in 2, 7220C in 3) and CPI Ventak PRxIII in 9 patients. For active can, shocks were delivered through distal coil to ICD shell and for PRxIII through the endotak lead of proximal to distal coil. Successful implantation criteria was 2 consecutive defibrillation at less than 24 J. Results All 15 patients had successful implantation using single lead ICD system in catheter laboratory. The mean defibrillation threshold was 12.8 J (5-15 J) and R wave was 9.9 mV (3.7-14.6 mV). All devices were of pectoral implantation. No operative and perioperative complications occurred. In 7.6 months (1 - 18 months) of follow-up, 3 patients had VT terminated by antitachycardia pacing (ATP) and 1 patient VF terminated by shock. Conclusion Transveneous pectoral implantation of single lead ICD is easy to perform and has high defibrillation efficacy and should be a preferred approach.

84873946023	The role of the Hsp90/Akt pathway in myocardial calpain-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis during sepsis	Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that myocardial calpain triggers caspase-3 activation and myocardial apoptosis in models of sepsis, whereas the inhibition of calpain activity down-regulates myocardial caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying this pathological process is unclear. Therefore, in this study, our aim was to explore whether the Hsp90/Akt signaling pathway plays a role in the induction of myocardial calpain activity, caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in the septic mice.Methods: Adult male C57 mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 4 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce sepsis. Next, myocardial caspase-3 activity and the levels of Hsp90/p-Akt (phospho-Akt) proteins were detected, and apoptotic cells were assessed by performing the TUNEL assay.Results: In the septic mice, there was an increase in myocardial calpain and caspase-3 activity in addition to an increase in the number of apoptotic cells; however, there was a time-dependent decrease in myocardial Hsp90/p-Akt protein levels. The administration of calpain inhibitors (calpain inhibitor-Sh{cyrillic} or PD150606) prevented the LPS-induced degradation of myocardial Hsp90/p-Akt protein and its expression in cardiomyocytes in addition to inhibiting myocardial caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. The inhibition of Hsp90 by pretreatment with 17-AAG induced p-Akt degradation, and the inhibition of Akt activity by pretreatment with wortmannin resulted in caspase-3 activation in wildtype C57 murine heart tissues.Conclusions: Myocardial calpain induces myocardial caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in septic mice via the activation of the Hsp90/Akt pathway. © 2013 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84876206786	Polymorphism of ZBTB17 gene is associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: A case control study in a Han Chinese population	Background: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been extensively investigated for many years, but its pathogenesis remains uncertain. The ACTC1 gene was the first sarcomeric gene whose mutation was shown to cause DCM; recent studies have indicated that the HSPB7 and ZBTB17 genes are also associated with DCM. To assess the potential role of these three genes in DCM, we examined 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ZBTB17, HSPB7 and ACTC1 genes: namely, rs10927875 in ZBTB17; rs1739843, rs7523558, and rs6660685 in HSPB7; rs533021, rs589759, rs1370154, rs2070664, rs3759834, rs525720 and rs670957 in ACTC1. Methods. A total of 97 DCM patients and 189 controls were included in the study. All SNPs were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Results: The genotype of SNP rs10927875 in ZBTB17 (OR=5.19, 95% CI =1.00 to 27.03, P=0.05) was associated with DCM in a Han Chinese population. There was no difference in genotype or allele frequencies in ACTC1 or HSPB7 between DCM patients and control subjects. Conclusion: The ZBTB17 polymorphism rs10927875 appears to play a role in the susceptibility of the Han Chinese population to DCM. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84876549584	TNNT2 gene polymorphisms are associated with susceptibility to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in the Han Chinese population	Background. Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction. The pathogenesis of DCM remains uncertain, and the TNNT2 gene is potentially associated with DCM. To assess the role of TNNT2 in DCM, we examined 10 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the patients. Methods. A total of 97 DCM patients and 189 control subjects were included in the study, and all SNPs were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results. In the TNNT2 gene, there was a significant association between DCM and genotype for the tagging SNPs rs3729547 (χ 2 = 6.63, P = 0.036, O R = 0.650, and 95% CI = 0.453-0.934) and rs3729843 (χ 2 = 9.787, P = 0.008, O R = 1.912, and 95% CI = 1.265-2.890) in the Chinese Han population. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed that the SNPs rs7521796, rs2275862, rs3729547, rs10800775, and rs1892028, which are approximately 6 kb apart, were in high LD (D ′ > 0.80) in the DCM patients. Conclusion. These results suggest that the TNNT2 polymorphisms might play an important role in susceptibility to DCM in the Chinese Han population. © 2013 Xiaoping Li et al.

84877064561	Preventive effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillator in reducing sudden cardiac death in the chinese population: A multicenter trial of ICD therapy versus non-ICD therapy	Preventive Effectiveness of Implantable Cardioverter. Introduction: This prospective and multicenter trial of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) aimed to evaluate the mortality rate (including sudden cardiac death [SCD]) and the efficacy of ICD in Chinese patients with high risk of sudden death. Methods and Results: This trial was conducted in 31 centers in China. We enrolled 497 patients who fulfilled Class I indication for ICD (2002 ACC/AHA/NASPE guideline). All patients were followed-up at 3, 6, and 12 months. Clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters were collected at baseline and follow-up; Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Among 497 enrolled patients with Class I indication of ICD therapy, 112 (22.5%) agreed to and received ICD implantation (ICD group). The remaining 385 patients who were not available for ICD therapy were designated as the non-ICD group. During a mean follow-up of 11 ± 3 months, there were a total of 38 deaths, 2 in the ICD group with a mortality of 1.8% and 36 in the non-ICD group, with a mortality of 9.4% and 26 due to SCD. The overall survival rate was 93% at 3 months of follow-up, 91% at 6 months, and 89% at 12 months, with an incidence of SCD of 5%, 7%, and 8% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with Class I indication of ICD implantation, the total mortality and incidence of SCD were high. ICD therapy can effectively reduce the mortality in such patients.

Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the utility and reliability of the OptiVol alert feature in clinical practice. Methods: We continuously recruited patients who underwent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation with feature of intrathoracic impedance monitoring system in our center from Sep. 2010 to Oct. 2012. Regular in-office follow-up were required of all patients and the following information was collected at each visit: medical history, device interrogation, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement and an echocardiogram. Worsening HF was defined as hospitalization or the presentation of signs or symptoms of HF. Results: Forty three patients (male: 76.7%, mean age: 57 ± 15 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 33% ± 14%) were included in this observational study. Fifty four alert events and 14 adjudicated worsening HF were detected within 288 ±163 days follow-up. Eleven (20.4%) alert episodes were associated with acute cardiac decompensation in 9 patients with a positive predictive value of 78.6%. Forty three audible alerts showed no connection to worsening HF. The unexplained alerts rate was 79.6% and 1.27 per person-year. Thirty seven alarm alerts were detected in patients with EF < 45%, among which 9 accompanied with HF, 17 alerts detected in patients with LVEF ≥ 45% and 2 associated with HF. There was no significant difference between the two groups (9/37 vs. 2/17; P = 0.47). Conclusions: Patients with normal or nearly normal left ventricular systolic function also exhibited considerable alert events. The OptiVol fluid index predicted worsening cardiac events with a high unexplained detection rate, and any alert must therefore be analyzed with great caution. Efforts to improve the specificity of this monitoring system represent a significant aspect of future studies. ©2013 JGC All rights reserved.

84886406816	The Influence of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme and Angiotensinogen Gene Polymorphisms on Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy	Some studies have reported that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen (AGT) genes have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there have been inconsonant results among different studies. To clarify the influence of ACE and AGT on HCM, a systemic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies were performed. The following databases were searched to indentify related studies: PubMed database, the Embase database, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, China National Knowledge Information database, and Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal database. Search terms included "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "angiotensin converting enzyme" (ACE) or "ACE" and "polymorphism or mutation". For the association of AGT M235T polymorphism and HCM, "angiotensin converting enzyme" or "ACE" was replaced with "angiotensinogen". A total of seventeen studies were included in our review. For the association of ACE I/D polymorphism and HCM, eleven literatures were included in the meta-analysis on association of penetrance and genotype. Similarly, six case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis for AGT M235T. For ACE I/D polymorphism, the comparison of DI/II genotype vs DD genotype was performed in the present meta-analysis. The OR was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.527, 0.998, P = 0.049, power = 94%, alpha = 0.05) after the study which deviated from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium was excluded, indicating that the ACE I/D gene polymorphism might be associated with HCM. The AGT M235T polymorphism did not significantly affect the risk of HCM. In addition, ACE I/D gene polymorphism did not significantly influence the interventricular septal thickness in HCM patients. In conclusion, the ACE I/D polymorphism might be associated with the risk of HCM. © 2013 Luo et al.

84891886051	Retrospective analysis on the clinical features and management of acute and subacute right ventricular perforation by pacemaker lead	Objective: To describe the clinical characteristics and management of the acute and subacute cardiac perforation by pacing leads. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of patients with acute and subacute right ventricular perforation by pacemaker lead occurred in our hospital between 2006 and 2011. Results: Seven cases of confirmed acute and subacute right ventricular perforation by pacemaker lead were enrolled. The perforation rate was 0.15%, 2 cases of perforation occurred during the procedure. The main manifestation was low blood pressure and pericardial effusion. These two patients with cardiac tamponade underwent urgent percutaneous pericardiocentesis and patients recovered without complication. The remaining 5 cases of perforation occurred within 4-16 days after the pacemaker implantation. The main symptoms were diaphragm stimulation and chest pain. Signs of leads dysfunction were observed in all 5 patients. The diagnosis of cardiac: perforation was confirmed by chest X-ray, echocardiography, or computed tomography. In all these 5 patients, the leads were removed by simple traction under fluoroscopic guidance with surgical backup support, no complication was observed. Conclusion: Acute and subacute right ventricular perforation is a rare but serious complication of pacemaker implantation. In most patients, the leads can be safely removed under fluoroscopic guidance with surgical backup support and close monitoring. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84899672250	The prognostic use of serum concentrations of cardiac troponin-I, CK-MB and myoglobin in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy	Objective: To examine the association between survival and serum concentrations of cTnI, CK-MB, and myoglobin in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC). Background: It has been suggested that elevated circulating biomarkers of myocardial damage such as cardiac troponin-I (cTnI), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) and myoglobin are independent risk factors for mortality in patients with heart failure, and recent studies, although limited, showed that there was a potential association between cTnI and the prognosis of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Methods: A cohort study was undertaken in 310 patients with IDC. Standard demographic information, transthoracic echocardiography, and routine blood tests were obtained shortly after hospital admission. Outcome was assessed with all-cause mortality. Results: Among the 310 patients studied, 61 (19.7%) died during a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. There was a significant difference in the all-cause mortality rate between patients with serum cTnI >0.05ng/mL and with cTnI ≤0.05ng/mL (37.5% vs 15%, log-rank χ

84899432370	SCN5A mutation in Chinese patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia	Background: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a genetically determined disorder, characterized by two components: cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia. To date, the ion channel-related pathogenesis underlying this phenomenon has been poorly understood. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the sodium channel variants in Chinese patients with ARVD. Patients and methods: Patients meeting the diagnostic guidelines of ARVD revised in 2010 were enrolled. All exons and exon-intron boundaries of the SCN5A gene and desmosomal genes known to be associated with ARVD, including DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, and PKP2, were sequenced by direct DNA sequencing. A total of 12 unrelated index patients were included in the study. Results: Eight of the patients developed ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), one of them showed epsilon wave, one of them showed type-1 Brugada wave, seven of them exhibited syncope or dizziness, and none of the patients had a family history of SCD. A new missense heterozygote mutation, I137M, in SCN5A was found in proband 5 with recurrent palpitations and a high incidence of VT. I137M is in exon 4 of SCN5A, at the S1 segment in domain I of Nav1.5, which predicted a substitution of isoleucine for methionine at codon site 137 (p. Ile137Met, I137M). I137M was not detected in 400 healthy control chromosomes from individuals of the same ethnic background, which indicated that this mutation was a conservative site in the SCN5A gene, and the encoded protein Nav1.5 might have a functional defect resulting in arrhythmia. Conclusion: This was the first study to systematically investigate sodium channel variants in Chinese patients with ARVD; a new SCN5A mutation, I137M, was found. This finding may provide new evidence of the genetic pathogenesis of ARVD in Chinese patients, implying that the SCN5A gene should be screened in patients with ARVD and VT/VF. © 2013 Urban & Vogel.

84899618612	Cleavage of IκBα by calpain induces myocardial NF-κB activation, TNF-α expression, and cardiac dysfunction in septic mice	Recent studies in septic models have shown that myocardial calpain activity and TNF-α expression increase during sepsis and that inhibition of calpain activation downregulates myocardial TNF-α expression and improves cardiac dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying this pathological process is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to explore whether IκBα/NF-κB signaling linked myocardial calpain activity and TNF-α expression in septic mice. Adult male mice were injected with LPS (4 mg/kg ip) to induce sepsis. Myocardial calpain activity, IκBα/NF-κB signaling activity, and TNF-α expression were assessed, and myocardial function was evaluated using the Langendorff system. In septic mice, myocardial calpain activity and TNF-α expression were increased and IκBα protein was degraded. Furthermore, NF-κB was activated, as indicated by increased NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, cleavage of p105 into p50, and its nuclear translocation. Administration of the calpain inhibitors calpain inhibitor III and PD-150606 prevented the LPS-induced degradation of myocardial IκBα, NF-κB activation, and TNF-α expression and ultimately improved myocardial function. In calpastatin transgenic mice, an endogenous calpain inhibitor and cultured neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes overexpressing calpastatin also inhibited calpain activity, IκBα protein degradation, and NF-κB activation after LPS treatment. In conclusion, myocardial calpain activity was increased in septic mice. Calpain induced myocardial NF-κB activation, TNF-α expression, and myocardial dysfunction in septic mice through IκBα protein cleavage. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.

84901918891	Plasma NT pro-BNP, hs-CRP and big-ET levels at admission as prognostic markers of survival in hospitalized patients with dilated cardiomyopathy: A single-center cohort study	Background: Circulating N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high- sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and big endothelin (big-ET) have been shown to be increased in heart failure and to contribute to both hemodynamic deterioration and cardiovascular remodeling. Here, we examined the prognostic value of the three neurohormones at admission in a population of hospitalized patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).Methods and results: This cohort study was undertaken in 622 hospitalized patients with DCM in Fuwai Hospital from January 2005 to September 2011 (female 26.5%, 51.4 ± 14.6 years old). Standard demographics, echocardiography and routine blood samples were obtained shortly after admission. NT pro-BNP, hs-CRP and big-ET were measured, and their concentrations in relation to all-cause mortality were assessed through a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 1.6 years. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the all-cause mortality rates were higher in patients with NT pro-BNP > 2247 pmol/L compared to patients with NT pro-BNP < 2247 pmol/L (11.9% vs 34.8%, log-rank χ

84903839068	The prevalence and prognostic effects of subclinical thyroid dysfunction in dilated cardiomyopathy patients: A single-center cohort study	Background Subclinical thyroid dysfunction may be a risk factor for mortality in patients with heart failure and may be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). This was a cohort study to examine the possible association between subclinical thyroid dysfunction and all-cause mortality in DCM patients, because the current evidence on this association remains elusive. Methods and Results A total of 963 DCM patients were evaluated for thyroid function. Of these patients, 7.1% (n = 68) had subclinical hyperthyroidism (defined as serum thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] <0.35 μIU/mL), 84.7% (n = 816) had euthyroidism (TSH 0.35-5.5 μIU/mL), and 8.2% (n = 79) had subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH >5.5 μIU/mL). There was a significant difference in all-cause mortality rates between patients with euthyroidism and patients with subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism (21%, 38.2%, and 26.6%, respectively; log-rank χ

84903879128	Incidence of sudden cardiac death of urban residents in Beijing	Objective: To explore the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) of urban residents in Beijing. Methods: A community based epidemiology survey was performed on the residents of 4 communities in the Xicheng and Haidian districts in Beijing from October 2008 to September 2009. Data on the total population, age, gender and vital status were monitored, and incidence of SCD as well as related information were collected from the household administrative workers, the family members of the deceased, the hospital personnel and the witnesses. Results: 479521 subjects (244000 men and 235521 women) were monitored, a total of 1285 (642 men and 643 women) all cause death occurred during the study period and 184 (86 men and 98 women) deaths were identified as SCD. The incidence of SCD was 35.2 (95% CI 27.8-42.7) per 100000 per year for men and 41.6 (95% CI 33.4 - 49.8) per 100 000 per year for women. SCD accounted for 13.4% mortality in men and 15.2% mortality in women. There were 171 (91.0%) SCD cases in residents over 55 years of age. The incidence of SCD for the age group 0 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 44, 45 - 54, 55 - 64, 65 - 74 and 75 years and over was 5.6, 4.6, 3.0, 9.8, 78.4, 88.4, and 272.8 per 100 000 per year for men, and 1.6, 0, 3.2, 0, 21.1, 84.2 and 470.0 per 100000 per year for women, respectively. The proportion of the cases that have at least one cardiovascular disease history was 57.0% (49/86) for men and 60.2% (59/98) for women. The cases that occurred at home, on the way to hospital, in the hospital emergency room, in the hospital ward and other places account for 53.3% (98 cases), 12.2% (22 cases), 9.2% (17 cases), 12.5% (23 cases) and 13.0% (24 cases) of the 184 SCD cases, respectively. Conclusion: SCD is a great threat to the urban residents in Beijing. Most SCD cases occurred at home on residents over 55 years of age. More than half SCD residents have at least one cardiovascular disease. It is important to take preventive measures in the urban residents over 55 years old and with history of cardiovascular disease.

84904695829	Incidence and predictors of sudden cardiac death in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after myocardial infarction in an era of revascularisation	Objective: To determine the incidence and predictors of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the current era of revascularisation of myocardial infarction (MI) survivors with reduced LVEF. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in FuWai Hospital from 2004 to 2009. A total of 1018 consecutive patients who had an LVEF ≤35% and New York Heart Association Class II/III heart failure at least 40 days after MI were enrolled if they were not available for implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The degree of coronary artery disease and revascularisation were analysed. The primary outcome was SCD and secondary outcome was all-cause death. Results: During a mean follow-up of 2.8 years, the SCD rate was 5% and all-cause mortality was 7.4%. The annual incidence of SCD was 1.8%. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the cumulative rate of SCD was significantly increased in patients with triple-vessel disease (6.7% vs 0.6%), left main coronary disease (10.3% vs 4.1%), EF ≤25% (8.3% vs 3.9%) and non-revascularisation therapy (9.6% vs 2.7%) (all log-rank, p<0.05). After multivariable Cox regression analysis, the risk of SCD was predicted by age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09), EF ≤25% (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.21) and non-revascularisation (HR 3.97, 95% CI 2.15 to 7.31). Conclusions: Revascularisation may reduce the risk of SCD in post-MI patients with an LVEF ≤35% on the basis of medical therapy, and the increased risk for SCD may be predicted by age, LVEF ≤25% and non-revascularisation.

84904811103	Cardiac troponin T (TNNT2) mutations in Chinese dilated cardiomyopathy patients	Background. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes of heart failure with high morbidity and mortality. Although more than 40 genes have been reported to cause DCM, the role of genetic testing in clinical practice is not well defined. Mutations in the troponin T (TNNT2) gene represent an important subset of known disease-causing mutations associated with DCM. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the genetic variations in TNNT2 and the associations of those variations with DCM in Chinese patients. Methods. An approximately 4 kb fragment of the TNNT2 gene was isolated from 103 DCM patients and 192 healthy controls and was analyzed by DNA sequence analysis for genetic variations. Results. A total of 6 TNNT2 mutations were identified in 99 patients, including a G321T missense mutation (Leu84Phe) and 5 novel intronic mutations. Alleles of two novel SNPs (c. 192 + 353 C > A, OR = 0.095, 95% CI: 0.013 - 0.714, P = 0.022; c. 192 + 463 G > A, OR = 0.090, 95% CI: 0.012 - 0.675, P = 0.019) and SNP rs3729843 (OR = 1.889, 95% CI: 1.252 - 2.852; P = 0.002) were significantly correlated with DCM. Conclusions. These results suggest that the missense mutation (Leu84Phe) and two novel SNPs (c. 192 + 353 C > A, c. 192 + 463 G > A) in TNNT2 gene might be associated with DCM in the Chinese population. © 2014 Xiaoping Li et al.

84909999134	Native QRS narrowing reflects electrical reversal and associates with anatomical reversal in cardiac resynchronization therapy	Results: Over median follow-up of 13 months, 47 patients had response to CRT and 30 subjects had abbreviation in native QRS duration. Native ΔQRS correlated positively with QRS duration pre- and post-CRT as well as with changes in echocardiography. Reversal of electrical remodeling as assessed by native QRS narrowing accompanied with greater improvements in LVEF (20 % ± 11 % vs 10% ± 10 %, p = 0.000) and LVEDD (14 ± 11 mm vs. 4 ± 10 mm, p = 0.000). Multivariate analysis indicated that native ΔQRS was the lone independent factor of ECG in association to response to CRT (OR1.049, 95%CI 1.015–1.085, p = 0.004): 83.3 % of patients with native QRS reduction were responders. Among the non-responders, 18.5 % had native QRS narrowing at follow-ups.

84920532259	High sensitivity C-reactive protein and cardfiac resynchronization therapy in patients with advanced heart failure	Background: The data on the prognostic values of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in patients with advanced symptomatic heart failure (HF) receiving cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) are scarce. The aim of present study was to investigate the association of serum hsCRP levels with left ventricle reverse remodeling after six months of CRT as well as long-term outcome. Methods: A total of 232 CRT patients were included. The assessment of hsCRP values, clinical status and echocardiographic data were performed at baseline and after six months of CRT. Long-term follow-up included all-cause mortality and hospitalizations for HF. Results: During the mean follow-up periods of 31.3 ± 31.5 months, elevated hsCRP (> 3 mg/L) prior to CRT was associated with a significant 2.39-fold increase (P = 0.006) in the risk of death or HF hospitalizations. At 6-month follow-up, patients who responded to CRT showed significant reductions or maintained low in hsCRP levels (-0.5 ± 4.1 mg/L reduction) compared with non-responders (1.7 ± 6.1 mg/L increase, P = 0.018). Compared with patients in whom 6-month hsCRP levels were reduced or remained low, patients in whom 6-month hsCRP levels were increased or maintained high experienced a significantly higher risk of subsequent death or HF hospitalizations (Log-rank P < 0.001). The echocardiographic improvement was also better among patients in whom 6-month hsCRP levels were reduced or remained low compared to those in whom 6-month hsCRP levels were raised or maintained high. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that measurement of baseline and follow-up hsCRP levels may be useful as prognostic markers for timely potential risk stratification and subsequent appropriate treatment strategies in patients with advanced HF undergoing CRT.

84922420360	Cardiac resynchronization therapy reduces T-wave alternans in patients with heart failure	Aims T-wave alternans (TWA) represents myocardial instability. The present study was to determine the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) on TWA and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in heart failure patients. Methods and results T-wave alternans was analysed using a spectral method in 27 CRT-ICD patients. Ambulatory device electrograms were collected and LVEF and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification were assessed at baseline prior to CRT and 3 months following CRT. Patients were followed for 6 months to monitor cardiac events. Spectral TWA of device electrograms was measured during AAI and CRT pacing tests. Each pacing mode had the up-titration pacing rate from 90 to 105 b.p.m. with 90 s for each pacing rate. At baseline, 20 (76.9%) patients had TWA during AAI pacing tests and 13 (50%) during CRT pacing tests (P = 0.044 between two pacing modes). Following 3-month CRT, TWA was identified in 11 patients (45.8%) during AAI pacing tests (a 31.1% reduction from the baseline value, P = 0.023) and 7 patients (28%) during CRT pacing tests (a 22% reduction, P = 0.108). Six of seven patients who had cardiac events had TWA (three patients had arrhythmic events, two died of heart failure, one received heart transplant). Overall, LVEF improved from 27.3 ± 5.8 to 35.9 ± 10.5% (P < 0.001) and NYHA classification improved from 2.8 ± 0.6 to 1.6 ± 0.6 after 3-month CRT (P < 0.001). Conclusion In heart failure patients who receive a CRT-ICD, CRT reduces TWA that is associated to cardiac events, suggesting that CRT promotes clinically significant reverse electrical and mechanical remodelling.
