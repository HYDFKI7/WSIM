15744375528	A chain multinomial model for estimating the real-time fatality rate of a disease, with an application to severe acute respiratory syndrome	It is well known that statistics using cumulative data are insensitive to changes. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of fatality rates are of the above type, which may not be able to reflect the latest changes in fatality due to treatment or government policy in a timely fashion. Here, the authors propose an estimate of a real-time fatality rate based on a chain multinomial model with a kernel function. It is more accurate than the WHO estimate in describing fatality, especially earlier in the course of an epidemic. The estimator provides useful information for public health policy makers for understanding the severity of the disease or evaluating the effects of treatments or policies within a shorter time period, which is critical in disease control during an outbreak. Simulation results showed that the performance of the proposed estimator is superior to that of the WHO estimator in terms of its sensitivity to changes and its timeliness in reflecting the severity of the disease.

21044436007	Estimating the proportion of cured patients in a censored sample	There has been a recurring interest in modelling survival data which hypothesize subpopulations of individuals highly susceptible to some types of adverse events while other individuals are assumed to be at much less risk, like recurrence of breast cancer. A binary random effect is assumed in this article to model the susceptibility of each individual. We propose a simple multiple imputation algorithm for the analysis of censored data which combines a binary regression formulation for the probability of occurrence of an event, say recurrence of the breast cancer tumour, and a Cox's proportional hazards regression model for the time to occurrence of the event if it does. The model distinguishes the effects of the covariates on the probability of cure and on the time to recurrence of the disease. A SAS macro has been written to implement the proposed multiple imputation algorithm so that sophisticated programming effort can be rendered into a user-friendly application. Simulation results show that the estimates are reasonably efficient. The method is applied to analyse the breast cancer recurrence data. The proposed method can be modified easily to accommodate more general random effects other than the binary random effects so that the random effects not only affect the probability of occurrence of the event, but also the heterogeneity of the time to recurrence of the event among the uncured patients.

21244443877	Factor analysis for ranked data with application to a job selection attitude survey	Factor analysis is a powerful tool to identify the common characteristics among a set of variables that are measured on a continuous scale. In the context of factor analysis for non-continuous-type data, most applications are restricted to item response data only. We extend the factor model to accommodate ranked data. The Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is used for parameter estimation at which the E-step is implemented via the Gibbs sampler. An analysis based on both complete and incomplete ranked data (e.g. rank the top q out of k items) is considered. Estimation of the factor scores is also discussed. The method proposed is applied to analyse a set of incomplete ranked data that were obtained from a survey that was carried out in GuangZhou, a major city in mainland China, to investigate the factors affecting people's attitude towards choosing jobs. © 2005 Royal Statistical Society.

21744450667	A marginal likelihood approach to estimation in frailty models	A marginal likelihood approach is proposed for estimating the parameters in a frailty model using clustered survival data. To overcome the analytic intractability of the marginal likelihood function, we propose a Monte Carlo approximation using the technique of importance sampling. Implementation is by means of simulations from the uniform distribution. The suggested method can cope with censoring and unequal cluster sizes and can be applied to any frailty distribution with explicit Laplace transform. We concentrate on a two-parameter family that includes the gamma, inverse Gaussian, and posilive stable distributions as special cases. The method is illustrated using data from an animal carcinogenesis experiment and validated in a simulation study.

0004103505	A class of tests for the equality of k cause-specific hazard rates in a competing risks model	A class of asymptotically distribution-free tests for the equality of the k risks in a competing risks model is considered. The tests can be derived by martingale theory or by a marginal likelihood approach. When the risks are dependent, the quantities to be compared would be the cause-specific hazard rates or equivalently the pseudosurvivor functions related to the cause-specific hazard rates. This class of tests allows one to compare k risks simultaneously for k > 2, is able to handle possibly right-censored data and is extremely simple to apply. Choices of the optimal weight functions leading to the locally most powerful rank tests for a general class of semiparametric alternative hypotheses are discussed. The performances of the tests are studied by simulation under various alternative hypotheses.

24144438218	A semiparametric regression cure model with current status data	This paper considers the analysis of current status data with a cured proportion in the population using a mixture model that combines a logistic regression formulation for the probability of cure with a semiparametric regression model for the time to occurrence of the event. The semiparametric regression model belongs to the flexible class of partly linear models that allows one to explore the possibly nonlinear effect of a certain covariate on the response variable. A sieve maximum likelihood estimation method is proposed and the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are discussed. Under some mild conditions, the estimators are shown to be strongly consistent. The convergence rate of the estimator for the unknown smooth function is obtained and the estimator for the unknown parameter is shown to be asymptotically efficient and normally distributed. Simulation studies were carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method and the model is fitted to a dataset from a study of calcification of the hydrogel intraocular lenses, a complication of cataract treatment. © 2005 Biometrika Trust.

24344489949	Validated questionnaire on diagnosis and symptom severity for functional constipation in the Chinese population	Background: Functional constipation is a common problem in clinical practice. No validated questionnaire is available in Chinese. Aim: To develop a validated questionnaire for diagnosis and symptom assessment in functional constipation for the Chinese population. Methods: One hundred and eleven patients with constipation and 110 healthy controls were presented with a 24-item constipation questionnaire in the Chinese language. Quality of life in constipation patients was assessed by Short Form-36. Polyethylene glycol was prescribed, for 4 weeks, to 20 patients with newly diagnosed constipation. The questionnaire was administered before and 4 weeks after treatment. Concept, content, construct, discriminant validity and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed. Results: Six items were selected by logistic regression to account for most of the differences between controls and constipated patients with a good reproducibility and internal consistency. A cut-off score of ≥5 was determined to discriminate between controls and constipated patients with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 91%. The constipation questionnaire correlated negatively with seven domains of the Short Form-3 6 and discriminated between constipated patients who reported symptomatic improvement during polyethylene glycol treatment. Conclusions: The Chinese constipation questionnaire could be used in epidemiological studies to assess the frequency and severity of constipation in patient populations and in interventional studies of constipation. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

26844492891	Merits of modelling multivariate survival data using random effects proportional odds model	Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the analysis of multivariate survival data. In most epidemiological studies, survival times of the same cluster are related because of some unobserved risk factors such as the environmental or genetic factors. Therefore, modelling of dependence between events of correlated individuals is required to ensure a correct inference on the effects of treatments or covariates on the survival times. In the past decades, extension of proportional hazards model has been widely considered for modelling multivariate survival data by incorporating a random effect which acts multiplicatively on the hazard function. In this article, we consider the proportional odds model, which is an alternative to the proportional hazards model at which the hazard ratio between individuals converges to unity eventually. This is a reasonable property particularly when the treatment effect fades out gradually and the homogeneity of the population increases over time. The objective of this paper is to assess the influence of the random effect on the within-subject correlation and the population heterogeneity. We are particularly interested in the properties of the proportional odds model with univariate random effect and correlated random effect. The correlations between survival times are derived explicitly for both choices of mixing distributions and are shown to be independent of the covariates. The time path of the odds function among the survivors are also examined to study the effect of the choice of mixing distribution. Modelling multivariate survival data using a univariate mixing distribution may be inadequate as the random effect not only characterises the dependence of the survival times, but also the conditional heterogeneity among the survivors. A robust estimate for the correlation of the logarithm of the survival times within a cluster is obtained disregarding the choice of the mixing distributions. The sensitivity of the estimate of the regression parameter under a misspecification of the mixing distribution is studied through simulation. © 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

27244434834	Bayesian analysis of clustered interval-censored data	The recording of multiple interval-censored failure times is common in dental research. Modeling multilevel data has been a difficult task. This paper aims to use the Bayesian approach to analyze a set of multilevel clustered interval-censored data from a clinical study to investigate the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride and sodium fluoride varnish in arresting active dentin caries in Chinese pre-school children. The time to arrest dentin caries on a surface was measured. A three-level random-effects Weibull regression model was used. Analysis was performed with WinBUGS. Results revealed a strong positive correlation (0.596) among the caries lesions' arrest times on different surfaces from the same child. The software WinBUGS made the above complicated estimation simple. In conclusion, the annual application of silver diamine fluoride on caries lesions, and caries removal before the application, were found to shorten the arrest time.

26244455748	Differing coping mechanisms, stress level and anorectal physiology in patients with functional constipation	Aim: To investigate coping mechanisms, constipation symptoms and anorectal physiology in 80 constipated subjects and 18 controls. Methods: Constipation was diagnosed by Rome II criteria. Coping ability and anxiety/depression were assessed by validated questionnaires. Transit time and balloon distension test were performed. Results: 34.5% patients were classified as slow transit type of constipation. The total colonic transit time (56 h vs 10 h, P<0.0001) and rectal sensation including urge sensation (79 mL vs 63 mL, P = 0.019) and maximum tolerable volume (110 mL vs 95 mL, P = 0.03) differed in patients and controls. Constipated subjects had significantly higher anxiety and depression scores and lower SF-36 scores in all categories. They also demonstrated higher scores of 'monitoring' coping strategy (14±6 vs 9±3, P = 0.001), which correlated with the rectal distension sensation (P = 0.005), urge sensation (P=0.002), and maximum tolerable volume (P = 0.035). The less use of blunting strategy predicted slow transit constipation in both univariate (P = 0.01) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Defective or ineffective use of coping strategies may be an important etiology in functional constipation and subsequently reflected in abnormal anorectal physiology. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

29044445757	Determinants of bone mineral density in Chinese men	Osteoporotic fractures are increasing among Asian populations in both genders, but the risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD) in Asian men is unclear. To determine the hormonal and lifestyle risk factors for low BMD in Asian men, we studied 407 community-dwelling southern Chinese men aged 50 years and above. Medical history and lifestyle habits were obtained with a structured questionnaire. Dietary calcium and phytoestrogen intake were assessed by a semi-quantitative questionnaire. BMD at the spine and hip were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Fasting blood was analyzed for 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), total and bioavailable estradiol (bio-E) and testosterone (bio-T). The mean age of the cohort was 68.42 ± 10.4 (50-96) years. In the linear regression model, weight, age, body mass index (BMI), bio-E, PTH, cigarette smoking and weight-bearing exercise were significant determinants of total hip BMD. Together they explained 55% of the total variance of hip BMD, with body weight being the most important determining factor. With age and weight adjustment, height, bio-T and flavonoid intake were identified as additional determinants of total hip BMD. Strategies to prevent bone loss and osteoporosis in Asian men should include lifestyle modification and maintenance of hormonal sufficiency. © International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation 2005.

2942599714	Sieve maximum likelihood estimator for semiparametric regression models with current status data	In a randomized controlled clinical trial study where the response variable of interest is the time to occurrence of a certain event, it is often too expensive or even impossible to observe the exact time. However, the current status of the subject at a random time of inspection is much more natural, feasible, and practical in terms of cost-effectiveness. This article considers a semiparametric regression model that consists of parametric and nonparametric regression components. A sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is proposed to estimate the regression parameter, allowing exploration of the nonlinear relationship between a certain covariate and the response function. Asymptotic properties of the proposed sieve MLEs are discussed. Under some mild conditions, the estimators are shown to be strongly consistent. Moreover, the estimators of the unknown parameters are asymptotically efficient and normally distributed, and the estimator of the nonparametric function has an optimal convergence rate. Simulation studies were carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method. For illustration purposes, the method is applied to a dataset from a study of the calcification of the hydrogel intraocular lenses, a complication of cataract treatment.

28844435701	Use of the Minimum Data Set - Home Care: A cluster randomized controlled trial among the Chinese older adults	The objective of this study was to test whether the utilization of Minimum Data Set - Home Care (MDS-HC) as a case finding instrument for Chinese attenders of elderly health centres in Hong Kong had a beneficial impact on the physical and mental health status of those older clients. The dependent variables were 13 outcome variables measuring different dimensions of participants' physical and mental health status. Using a cluster randomized controlled trial design, we assigned three of six participating elderly health centres to the experimental group and the other three to the control group. The respondents were 925 (472 in the experimental group and 453 in the control group) elderly health centre attenders aged 65 years or above. They were assessed by MDS-HC and 734 (382 in the experimental group and 352 in the control group) of them were re-assessed one year later. In the experimental group, the medical doctors had been given their patients' profile of potential problem areas identified by MDS-HC before they treated their patients whereas in the control, the medical doctors treated their patients with their usual practice. We found that older attenders in the experimental group improved more than the ones in the control group in only two out of 13 areas. Surprisingly, the patients in the experimental group deteriorated even more than the ones in the control group in terms of bowel incontinence. Our results indicated that the function of the MDS-HC in case finding or screening is limited in the Hong Kong primary medical care setting. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

3042696407	Excess hospital admissions for pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure during influenza seasons in Hong Kong	It is widely held that Southern China is a hypothetical influenza epicentre for the emergence of pandemic influenza viruses. However, influenza is perceived as a relatively unimportant infection in this part of the world compared with western countries. Hong Kong is situated within the hypothetical epicentre and serves as a sentinel post for the region. In a retrospective study, the influenza-associated excess hospitalisations in a regional hospital for pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, and asthma in persons aged ≥65 years from 1998 to 2001 were each estimated by a model taking into consideration the confounding effect of other respiratory viral infections, seasonal factors, time trends, and weather and pollution indices. In the regression models, influenza activity is an independent significant factor affecting admission rates for pneumonia, COPD, and heart failure but not that for asthma. The variations in hospital admissions for pneumonia, COPD, and heart failure explained by influenza activity were 38.9, 7.5, and 45.6%, respectively. The adjusted rates of excess influenza-associated hospital admissions for the three diagnoses combined amounted to 58.5, 20.0, 29.2, and 13.4 per 10,000 populations aged ≥65 years in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. In conclusion, influenza activity is associated significant excess hospital admissions among elderly aged 65 or above in Hong Kong, comparable to the data reported in Western countries. The findings support a wider application of annual influenza vaccination in this region. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33744496293	Incidence and predictors of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease	Aim: The use of low-dose aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease events is well established. However, the incidence and predictors of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) with its use are unknown. We studied prospectively the incidence and outcome of peptic ulceration in low-dose aspirin users. Methods: A total of 991 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) on low-dose aspirin were prospectively followed-up for two years for the occurrence and clinical features of first hospitalized episode of UGIB. Results: UGIB had a bimodal presentation with 45% occurring within four months of aspirin initiation and had an overall prevalence of 1.5% per year. There was no UGIB-related death. Hypertension (OR = 4.6, 95%CI 1.5 - 14.7, P = 0.009), history of peptic ulceration (OR = 3.1, 95%CI 1.1 - 9.0, P = 0.039), tertiary education (OR = 3.08, 95%CI 1.1 - 9.0, P = 0.039) and higher lean body mass (P = 0.016) were independent factors associated with UGIB. Use of nitrate did not reduce UGIB. Conclusion: The incidence of UGIB in patients with CAD on long-term low-dose aspirin is low, but is accompanied with significant morbidity. With prolonged use of aspirin, UGIB continues to be a problem for those with risk factors and especially in patients with a history of peptic ulcers, in which UGIB tends to occur early after aspirin therapy. © 2006 The WJG Press.

33745346627	Why do primary care doctors undertake postgraduate diploma studies in a mixed private/public Asian setting?	Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the reasons why primary care doctors undertake postgraduate diploma studies in a mixed private/public Asian setting. Methods: Twenty four past or current postgraduate diploma students of the family medicine unit (FMU) of the University of Hong Kong participated in three focus group interviews. A structured questionnaire was constructed based on the qualitative data collected and was sent to 328 former applicants of postgraduate diploma studies at FMU. Results: "Upgrading medical knowledge and skills" and "improving quality of practice" were two of the factors that most of the respondents considered to be significant in motivating them to undertake postgraduate diploma studies. "Time constraint" and "workload in practice" were however the most significant demotivating factors. Financial issues were more seriously considered by the junior than the senior doctors. To be able to "expand patient base and/or number" was considered to be a significant factor by the private doctors who were also keen to "improve communication and relationship with patients". Conclusion: These findings suggest that there are mixed reasons for primary care doctors to undertake postgraduate diploma studies. Course organisers should take into consideration these various reasons in planning their programmes.

33745918313	Coexistence between colorectal cancer/adenoma and coronary artery disease: Results from 1382 patients	Background: Common risk factors exist in colorectal neoplasia (cancer or adenoma) and coronary artery disease. Aim: To investigate in a retrospective study if there is coexistence of the two events in patients ≥50 years. Methods: Computer data on colonoscopies performed on symptomatic patients, the corresponding medical record and colonic histology in 1997-2000 were retrieved. History of coronary artery disease was recorded. To adjust for the factors of age and sex, bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test for coexistence. Results: 1382 patients were recruited. Colorectal neoplasia and history of coronary artery disease were present in 27% (373) and 12% (167) of patients, respectively. The mean age of patients was older in colorectal neoplasia+ (75 ± 11 vs. 69 ± 13 years, P < 0.0001) and in coronary artery disease+ (79 ± 9 vs. 69 ± 12 years, P < 0.0001) patients. Male was the predominant sex in colorectal neoplasia+: 33% vs. 22% (P < 0.0001), but not in coronary artery disease+ (P = 0.29). Colorectal neoplasia+ patients were more likely to have coronary artery disease+ [21.2% (79/ 373) vs. 8.8% (89/1098) (P < 0.0001)]. Bivariate logistic regression analysis showed strong association between the two events (OR: 2.12, 95% CI: 1.5, 3.0). Conclusion: There is strong coexistence of colorectal neoplasia and coronary artery disease, probably due to exposure to common risk factors. © 2006 The Authors.

33748323445	Comparison between empirical prokinetics, Helicobacter test-and-treat and empirical endoscopy in primary-care patients presenting with dyspepsia: A one-year study	Aim: To investigate the optimal strategy to treat dyspeptic patients in primary care. Methods: Dyspeptic patients presenting to primary care outpatient clinics were randomly assigned to: (1) empirical endoscopy, (2) H pylori test-and-treat, and (3) empirical prokinetic treatment with cisapride. Early endoscopy was arranged if patients remained symptomatic after 2 wk. Symptom severity, quality-of-life (SF-36) as well as patient preference and satisfaction were assessed. All patients underwent endoscopy by wk 6. Patients were followed up for one year. Results: Two hundred and thirty four patients were recruited (163 female, mean age 49). 46% were H pylori positive. 26% of H pylori tested and 25% of empirical prokinetic patients showed no improvement at wk 2 follow-up and needed early endoscopy. 15% of patients receiving empirical cisapride responded well to treatment but peptic ulcer was the final diagnosis. Symptom resolution and quality-of-life were similar among the groups. Costs for the three strategies were HK$4343, $1771 and $1750 per patient. 66% of the patients preferred to have early endoscopy. Conclusion: The three strategies are equally effective. Empirical prokinetic treatment was the least expensive but peptic ulcers may be missed with this treatment. The H pylori test-and-treat was the most cost-effective option. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

33750504029	Comparison of esophageal acid exposure distribution along the esophagus among the different gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) groups	BACKGROUND: Patients with nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) have the lowest esophageal acid exposure profile compared with the other gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) groups. AIM: To compare lower esophageal acid exposure recordings 1 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) with those 6 cm above the LES as well as to determine the characteristics of esophageal acid exposure along the esophagus among the different GERD groups. METHODS: Patients with classic heartburn symptoms were enrolled into the study. Patients were evaluated by a demographics questionnaire and the validated GERD Symptom Checklist. Upper endoscopy was performed to evaluate the presence of esophageal erosions and Barrett's esophagus (BE). Ambulatory pH testing was performed using a commercially available 4-sensor pH probe with sensors located 5 cm apart. The distal sensor was placed 1 cm above the LES. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients completed the study. Of those, 21 patients had NERD, 20 had erosive esophagitis (EE), and 23 had BE. All patient groups demonstrated greater esophageal acid exposure 1 cm above the LES than 6 cm above the LES. In NERD and EE, this phenomenon was primarily a result of a higher mean percentage of upright time with pH <4. Unlike patients with EE and BE, those with NERD had very little variation in esophageal acid exposure throughout the esophagus (total and supine). CONCLUSIONS: ALL GERD groups demonstrated significant greater esophageal acid exposure at the very distal portion of the esophagus, primarily as a result of short upright reflux events. Unlike erosive esophagitis and BE, NERD patients demonstrate a more homogenous acid distribution along the esophagus. © 2006 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

33845494068	Semiparametric analysis of zero-inflated count data	Medical and public health research often involve the analysis of count data that exhibit a substantially large proportion of zeros, such as the number of heart attacks and the number of days of missed primary activities in a given period. A zero-inflated Poisson regression model, which hypothesizes a two-point heterogeneity in the population characterized by a binary random effect, is generally used to model such data. Subjects are broadly categorized into the low-risk group leading to structural zero counts and high-risk (or normal) group so that the counts can be modeled by a Poisson regression model. The main aim is to identify the explanatory variables that have significant effects on (i) the probability that the subject is from the low-risk group by means of a logistic regression formulation; and (ii) the magnitude of the counts, given that the subject is from the high-risk group by means of a Poisson regression where the effects of the covariates are assumed to be linearly related to the natural logarithm of the mean of the counts. In this article we consider a semiparametric zero-inflated Poisson regression model that postulates a possibly nonlinear relationship between the natural logarithm of the mean of the counts and a particular covariate. A sieve maximum likelihood estimation method is proposed. Asymptotic properties of the proposed sieve maximum likelihood estimators are discussed. Under some mild conditions, the estimators are shown to be asymptotically efficient and normally distributed. Simulation studies were carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method. For illustration purpose, the method is applied to a data set from a public health survey conducted in Indonesia where the variable of interest is the number of days of missed primary activities due to illness in a 4-week period. © 2006, The International Biometric Society.

33750878541	Semi-parametric accelerated failure time regression analysis with application to interval-censored HIV/AIDS data	This paper demonstrates a way to investigate a potentially non-linear relationship between an interval-censored response variable and a continuously distributed explanatory variable. A potentially non-linear effect of a continuous explanatory variable on the response is incorporated into an accelerated failure time model, forming a partial linear model. A sieve maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is suggested to simultaneously estimate all the parameters. The sieve MLE is shown to be asymptotically efficient and normally distributed. Simulation studies show that the proposed estimators for the scale and regression parameters are robust and efficient, and the estimator for the non-linear function is able to capture the shape of a variety of smooth non-linear functions. The model is applied to observational HIV data, where the response variable is the time to suppression of HIV viral load after initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and baseline viral load is investigated as a potentially non-linear effect.

33846131525	Familial aggregation in constipated subjects in a tertiary referral center	OBJECTIVES: Clinical observation showed that there is family aggregation in constipated subjects, but formal data are lacking. This prompted us to conduct a formal family study in constipated subjects. METHODS: Constipated subjects (probands) were identified according to the Rome II and Chinese constipation questionnaire criteria, healthy subjects were chosen as controls. Living first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) and spouses (as internal controls) from both groups were identified. The questionnaire on Rome II criteria was given to the relatives either through the index subjects or by mail. The questionnaire was received by mailing back or through the index subjects. Any nonresponders were chased. RESULTS: There were 132 probands with constipation and 114 controls. The Rome II questionnaire was sent to a total of 677 relatives of the probands and 591 of the controls. Relatives were comparable in mean age, sex distribution, family size, and marital status in the two groups. Constipation prevalence was 16.4% in probands' relatives versus 9.1% in controls' relatives, i.e., 13% in the relatives from both proband and controls. Among the constipated relatives, 6.3% versus 9.3% of the relatives were spouses of the probands and controls (P = 0.5). Subjects with more family members having constipation will have higher risk of constipation: OR 2.02, CI 1.14-3.65, P = 0.0177 for at least one family member; OR 3.99, CI 1.86-9.23, P = 0.0006 for at least two family members. CONCLUSIONS: Familial aggregation of constipation occurs, supporting a genetic or intrafamilial environment component. © 2007 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

33846826966	Influence of Positive Family History on Clinical Characteristics of Functional Constipation	Background & Aims: We observed that there is familial aggregation in patients with functional constipation. Their clinical characteristics have not been studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with functional constipation with and without a positive family history. Methods: Patients with functional constipation satisfying Rome II criteria were recruited. A Rome II questionnaire on constipation was given to the patients' families to identify whether there were any family members with idiopathic constipation. The clinical characteristics between those with and without positive family history were evaluated. Results: There were 118 patients with at least one first-degree relative with idiopathic constipation and 114 patients without a positive family history. The patients in the 2 groups were comparable in mean age (P = .3) and sex distribution (P = .09). Patients with positive family history had a younger age of onset (median, 11-20 years vs 21-30 years, P < .0001); longer duration of constipation (20 ± 14 vs 15 ± 13, P = .016); more complications, eg, symptomatic hemorrhoids, anal fissure, and rectal prolapse (54.2% vs 40.4%, P = .034); less precipitating factors leading to the onset of constipation (35.6% vs 49.1%, P = .037); more frequent use of digital evacuation (27.1% vs 13.2%, P = .008), but no difference in the association with psychological disorders (P = .3); transit time (P = .5); or manometric dyssynergia (P = .5). Conclusions: Patients with idiopathic constipation and with a positive family history exhibited different clinical characteristics. This might be related to the early age of onset of the symptoms, which might, in turn, give clues to the underlying etiology. © 2007 AGA Institute.

34247101532	Positive association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome in a Chinese population	Background: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome are common diseases which may be related. Aim: To examine the association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome in Chinese population in Hong Kong. Methods: Randomly selected ethnic Chinese were invited to participate in a telephone survey in 1996. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was defined as subjects having heartburn and/or acid regurgitation once weekly or more. Irritable bowel syndrome was diagnosed according to the Rome I criteria. The association between gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome was calculated using a statistical model which allows the odds ratio to be measured. Results: One thousand six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate 62%). The population prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome were 5% and 4%, respectively. Thirteen per cent of subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and 11% with irritable bowel syndrome suffered from both gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome. The OR of having gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and irritable bowel syndrome together was estimated to be 3 (95% CI: 1.05, 6.27) indicating a positive association between the two diseases. This association occurred predominantly in male subjects [OR = 9.3, (95% CI: 2.3, 26.2)] but not as strong in females [OR = 1.5, (95% CI: 0.3, 4.3)]. Younger subjects were statistically more prone to the two diseases.

34249306512	Assessment of intervention measures for the 2003 SARS epidemic in Taiwan by use of a back-projection method	OBJECTIVES. To reconstruct the infection curve for the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan and to ascertain the temporal changes in the daily number of infections that occurred during the course of the outbreak. METHOD. Back-projection method. RESULTS. The peaks of the epidemic correspond well with the occurrence of major infection clusters in the hospitals. The overall downward trend of the infection curve after early May corresponds well to the date (May 10) when changes in the review and classification procedure were implemented by the SARS Prevention and Extrication Committee. CONCLUSION. The major infection control measures taken by the Taiwanese government over the course of the SARS epidemic, particularly those regarding infection control in hospitals, played a crucial role in containing the outbreak. © 2007 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

37749010736	Nonparametric estimation of multiplicative counting process intensity functions with an application to the Beijing SARS epidemic	The local polynomial methods and martingale estimating equations are used to develop closed form estimators of the intensity function and its derivatives for multiplicative counting process models. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators are established. The estimator generalizes that proposed by Ramlau-Hansen (1983) with a smaller bias than the Ramlau-Hansen intensity estimator. The derivative estimators give smoother estimates than the Ramlau-Hansen derivative estimators. The proposed estimators are applied to analyze the infection rate and its derivatives of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Beijing, China.

0033739899	Validation of Minimum Data Set for Home Care assessment instrument (MDS-HC) for Hong Kong Chinese elders	The objective of this study was to validate the Chinese version of Minimum Data Set-Home Care (MDS-HC) in Hong Kong Chinese elders. The respondents were 179 people aged 60 years or older who attend an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. Firstly, inter-rater reliability was examined and we found acceptable inter-rater reliability. Internal consistency was also obtained for all the composite outcome measures in MDS-HC and most of the Cronbach coefficients were in the range from 0.6 to 0.8. Finally, the concurrent validity of the Chinese version of MDS-HC was assessed by comparing the MDS-HC triggered CAPs and a clinician's diagnoses. We found that high consistency between the results from MDS-HC and clinical judgement in 20 out of 30 CAPs.

4043079270	Serotype distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nasopharyngeal and invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates in Hong Kong children	A study was conducted to determine the vaccine coverage of prevalent carriage and invasive pneumococci from children aged less than 6 years in Hong Kong. A total of 383 nasopharyngeal carriage isolates and 88 invasive isolates from diverse sources were serotyped and their antimicrobial susceptibilities determined. The most common carriage serotypes were the same as the invasive isolates (6B, 14, 19F and 23F), although the rank order of specific serotypes was different. Serotypes in the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) accounted for 89.7 and 66.1% of the invasive and carriage isolates, respectively. The same seven serotypes comprised 87.5% invasive isolates and 82.8% carriage isolates with resistance to penicillin, erythromycin and/or cefotaxime. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

31744448992	Multilevel modelling of clustered grouped survival data using Cox regression model: An application to ART dental restorations	In some controlled clinical trials in dental research, multiple failure time data from the same patient are frequently observed that result in clustered multiple failure time. Moreover, the treatments are often delivered by more than one operator and thus the multiple failure times are clustered according to a multilevel structure when the operator effects are assumed to be random. In practice, it is often too expensive or even impossible to monitor the study subjects continuously, but they are examined periodically at some regular pre-scheduled visits. Hence, discrete or grouped clustered failure time data are collected. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of the Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) approach and non-informative prior in a Bayesian framework to mimic the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation in a frequentist approach in multilevel modelling of clustered grouped survival data. A three-level model with additive variance components model for the random effects is considered in this paper. Both the grouped proportional hazards model and the dynamic logistic regression model are used. The approximate intra-cluster correlation of the log failure times can be estimated when the grouped proportional hazards model is used. The statistical package WinBUGS is adopted to estimate the parameter of interest based on the MCMC method. The models and method are applied to a data set obtained from a prospective clinical study on a cohort of Chinese school children that atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) restorations were placed on permanent teeth with carious lesions. Altogether 284 ART restorations were placed by five dentists and clinical status of the ART restorations was evaluated annually for 6 years after placement, thus clustered grouped failure times of the restorations were recorded. Results based on the grouped proportional hazards model revealed that clustering effect among the log failure times of the different restorations from the same child was fairly strong (corr

0034906428	Management of upper respiratory tract infection by family doctors	The prescribing behaviour of family doctors in Hong Kong towards upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and the factors that might affect such behaviour were studied. All 1016 members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians were sent a postal questionnaire. A total of 730 family doctors completed the questionnaire, with an overall response rate of 71.8%. Doctors who were older, more senior, or in private practice were more likely to think antibiotics were useful for URTIs and to prescribe them. These doctors were also more likely to think their patients would expect antibiotics from them. Postgraduate vocational training in general practice/family medicine helped make family doctors think fewer patients would expect antibiotics from them but did not affect their perception of the usefulness of antibiotics for URTIs. Our results showed that doctors with certain characteristics were more likely to prescribe antibiotics for URTIs and these doctors may be targeted for continued medical education.

79952404701	Increased arterial stiffness in patients with psoriasis is associated with active systemic inflammation	Background Psoriasis is associated with premature atherosclerosis although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Objectives We sought to investigate the relationship between disease activity and systemic inflammation in patients with psoriasis, and macrovascular and microvascular function. Methods Fifty-two patients with psoriasis (mean ± SD age 44 ± 8 years; 38 men) were compared with 50 age- and sex-matched controls. Baseline demographics and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level were recorded for each subject. Psoriatic disease activity was assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Arterial stiffness and endothelial function were assessed using brachial to ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and digital hyperaemic response measured using the peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) index. Results Patients with psoriasis had significantly higher hs-CRP (mean ± SD 5·3 ± 5·1 vs. 1·9 ± 1·6 mg L

79952704105	Age, period, and cohort analysis of regular dental care behavior and edentulism: A marginal approach	Background: To analyze the regular dental care behavior and prevalence of edentulism in adult Danes, reported in sequential cross-sectional oral health surveys by the application of a marginal approach to consider the possible clustering effect of birth cohorts.Methods: Data from four sequential cross-sectional surveys of non-institutionalized Danes conducted from 1975-2005 comprising 4330 respondents aged 15+ years in 9 birth cohorts were analyzed. The key study variables were seeking dental care on an annual basis (ADC) and edentulism. For the analysis of ADC, survey year, age, gender, socio-economic status (SES) group, denture-wearing, and school dental care (SDC) during childhood were considered. For the analysis of edentulism, only respondents aged 35+ years were included. Survey year, age, gender, SES group, ADC, and SDC during childhood were considered as the independent factors. To take into account the clustering effect of birth cohorts, marginal logistic regressions with an independent correlation structure in generalized estimating equations (GEE) were carried out, with PROC GENMOD in SAS software.Results: The overall proportion of people seeking ADC increased from 58.8% in 1975 to 86.7% in 2005, while for respondents aged 35 years or older, the overall prevalence of edentulism (35+ years) decreased from 36.4% in 1975 to 5.0% in 2005. Females, respondents in the higher SES group, in more recent survey years, with no denture, and receiving SDC in all grades during childhood were associated with higher probability of seeking ADC regularly (P < 0.05). The interaction of SDC and age (P < 0.0001) was significant. The probabilities of seeking ADC were even higher among subjects with SDC in all grades and aged 45 years or older. Females, older age group, respondents in earlier survey years, not seeking ADC, lower SES group, and not receiving SDC in all grades were associated with higher probability of being edentulous (P < 0.05).Conclusions: With the use of GEE, the potential clustering effect of birth cohorts in sequential cross-sectional oral health survey data could be appropriately considered. The success of Danish dental health policy was demonstrated by a continued increase of regular dental visiting habits and tooth retention in adults because school dental care was provided to Danes in their childhood. © 2011 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

41849094074	Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving a combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin in acute coronary syndrome	BACKGROUND: The combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin (combination therapy) is the standard treatment for acute coronary syndrome but is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. However, information in this area is scarce. AIM: This retrospective study aimed to determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a real-life situation. The effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment was also analyzed. METHOD: From January 2002 to December 2006, all patients receiving combination therapy were analyzed. The end point was the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding during combination therapy or within 7 days of stopping enoxaparin. RESULTS: The patient group consisted of 666 patients (age 72.1 ± 12.6 yr). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 18 (2.7%) patients. The overall hospital mortality was 4.1% (27 patients). A cardiac event was the major cause (N = 24, 3.6%). Only one patient died of massive gastrointestinal bleeding (0.15%). Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that previous peptic ulcer, cardiogenic shock, and the lack of PPI coprescription were significant risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding. The age-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for gastrointestinal bleeding was 5.07 (1.31-16.58) for previous peptic ulcer, 21.41 (2.56-146.68) for cardiogenic shock, and 0.068 (0.010-0.272) for the coprescription with a PPI. CONCLUSION: In real life, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding associated with the combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin therapy was estimated to be 2.7%. Previous peptic ulcer disease or cardiogenic shock were significant independent risk factors. Coprescription with a PPI can significantly reduce the risk. © 2008 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

4544276202	The first batch of graduates of a new medical curriculum in Asia: How their teachers see them	OBJECTIVE: To examine teachers' views of the first batch of graduates of a revised medical curriculum in Asia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a structured questionnaire was carried out to obtain the views of all the clinical teachers involved in teaching final year students of the old curriculum in 2000-01 and the new curriculum in 2001-02 at the University of Hong Kong, which commenced curricular reform in 1997. RESULTS: Nearly 62% of respondents felt that better graduates were being produced with the new curriculum. The majority of them rated the new curriculum students better in nearly all the major goals of the new curriculum, such as self-directed learning initiative, problem solving skills, interpersonal skills and clinical performance in patient care. However, the core knowledge of the new curriculum students was of concern to some teachers. CONCLUSION: This study focused on the first complete cycle of a revised medical curriculum in Asia. Teachers' views of the new curriculum students were highly positive and they felt that better graduates were being produced.

4844224394	Onset and disappearance of reflux symptoms in a Chinese population: A 1-year follow-up study	Background: The natural history of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Asian population has not been studied before. Aim: To study the onset and disappearances of reflux symptoms over a 1-year period in the Chinese population. Methods: A population-based telephone survey was performed in 2002 and repeated 1 year later. The change in prevalence rate, onset and disappearance of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and the change in diagnoses were assessed. Factors associated with the onset and disappearance of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were studied. Results: A total of 712 subjects completed the first and second survey. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were 34.1%, 10.1% and 2.7% respectively. The onset rate (per 1000 person-year) and disappearance rate of any gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and frequent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (≥ monthly symptoms) were 209, 40; and 395, 243 respectively. Forty-four percentage of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease subjects changed their diagnoses in 2003. By multiple logistic regression analysis, high anxiety score (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.2) and higher educational level (OR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.3-6.3) were associated with the onset of gastrooesophageal reflux disease; while the frequency of acid regurgitation (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.70) and use of antisecretory therapy (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.89) were associated with the disappearance of gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Conclusion: The prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is stable over 1 year. Higher anxiety score and higher educational level were associated with the onset of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, while lower frequency of reflux symptoms and infrequent use of antisecretory therapy were associated with the disappearance of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in a Chinese population.

47649133264	Local polynomial estimation of Poisson intensities in the presence of reporting delays	Summary. The system for monitoring suicides in Hong Kong has considerable delays in reporting as the cause of death needs to be determined by a coroner's investigation. However, timely estimates of suicide rates are desirable to assist in the formulation of public health policies. This motivated us to develop a non-parametric procedure to estimate the intensity function of a Poisson process in the presence of reporting delays. We give closed form estimators of the Poisson intensity and the delay distribution, conduct simulation studies to evaluate the method proposed and derive their asymptotic properties. The method proposed is applied to estimate the intensity of suicide in Hong Kong. © 2008 Royal Statistical Society.

49749084808	A test for constant fatality rate of an emerging epidemic: With applications to severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong and Beijing	The etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis for a newly emerging disease are generally unknown to clinicians. Effective interventions and treatments at the earliest possible times are warranted to suppress the fatality of the disease to a minimum, and inappropriate treatments should be abolished. In this situation, the ability to extract most information out of the data available is critical so that important decisions can be made. Ineffectiveness of the treatment can be reflected by a constant fatality over time while effective treatment normally leads to a decreasing fatality rate. A statistical test for constant fatality over time is proposed in this article. The proposed statistic is shown to converge to a Brownian motion asymptotically under the null hypothesis. With the special features of the Brownian motion, we are able to analyze the first passage time distribution based on a sequential tests approach. This allows the null hypothesis of constant fatality rate to be rejected at the earliest possible time when adequate statistical evidence accumulates. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed test is good and it is extremely sensitive in picking up decreasing fatality rate. The proposed test is applied to the severe acute respiratory syndrome data in Hong Kong and Beijing. © 2008, The International Biometric Society.

65349131205	Iron supplement in pregnancy and development of gestational diabetes - A randomised placebo-controlled trial	Objective To test the hypothesis that iron supplement from early pregnancy would increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Design Randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting A university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Population One thousand one hundred sixty-four women with singleton pregnancy at less than 16 weeks of gestation with haemoglobin (Hb) level between 8 and 14 g/dl and no pre-existing diabetes or haemoglobinopathies. Methods Women were randomly allocated to receive 60 mg of iron supplement daily (n = 565) or placebo (n = 599). Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed at 28 and 36 weeks. Women were followed up until delivery. Outcome measures The primary outcome was development of GDM at 28 weeks. The secondary outcomes were 2-hour post-OGTT glucose levels, development of GDM at 36 weeks and delivery and infant outcomes. Results There was no significant difference in the incidence of GDM in the iron supplement and placebo groups at 28 weeks (OR: 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-1.53 at 90% power) or 36 weeks. Maternal Hb and ferritin levels were higher in the iron supplement group at delivery (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, respectively). Elective caesarean section rate was lower in the iron supplement group (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.89). Infant birthweight was heavier (P = 0.001), and there were fewer small-for-gestational-age babies in the iron supplement group (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.24-0.85). Conclusion Iron supplement from early pregnancy does not increase the risk of GDM. It may have benefits in terms of pregnancy outcomes. © RCOG 2009 BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

67649800834	Intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous amiodarone or digoxin for achieving ventricular rate control in patients with acute uncomplicated atrial fibrillation	Objectives: To compare the clinical efficacy of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone for acute ventricular rate (VR) control in patients with acute symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) necessitating hospitalization. Design: Randomized control trial. Setting: Acute emergency medical admission unit in a regional teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Patients: One hundred fifty adult patients with acute AF and rapid VR (>120 bpm). Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for VR control. Measurements and Main Results: The primary end point was sustained VR control (<90 bpm) within 24 hours; the secondary end points included AF symptom improvement and length of hospitalization. At 24 hours, VR control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%). The time to VR control was significantly shorter among patients in the diltiazem group (log-rank test, p < 0.0001) with the percentage of patients who achieved VR control being higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). The median time to VR control was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3 hours, 1-21 hours) compared with the digoxin (6 hours, 3-15 hours, p < 0.001) and amiodarone groups (7 hours, 1-18 hours, p = 0.003). Furthermore, patients in the diltiazem group persistently had the lowest mean VR after the first hour of drug administration compared with the other two groups (p < 0.05). The diltiazem group had the largest reduction in AF symptom frequency score and severity score (p < 0.0001). In addition, length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3.9 ± 1.6 days) compared with digoxin (4.7 ± 2.1 days, p = 0.023) and amiodarone groups (4.7 ± 2.2 days, p = 0.038). Conclusions: As compared with digoxin and amiodarone, intravenous diltiazem was safe and effective in achieving VR control to improve symptoms and to reduce hospital stay in patients with acute AF.

67651172930	Quality of life and psychological impact in patients with noncardiac chest pain	BACKGROUND: Chest pain is common and data regarding noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) in Asia are lacking. AIM: To determine the differences in clinical presentations, psychologic impact, and quality of life between patients with NCCP and cardiac chest pain (CCP), and to identify any factors that impacted on these patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography for the evaluation of chest pain were recruited in Hong Kong and Wuhan, China. One hundred and forty patients with abnormal and 141 patients with normal angiography were included in the study. The validated gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale, and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) were used for assessment. RESULTS: NCCP patients reported similar days-off work and impairment of their social life compared with those with CCP. No difference was found in the anxiety and depression scores between the 2 groups. NCCP patients with reflux symptoms had higher anxiety score (7.19 vs. 5.74, P=0.044), reported more interruption of their social life (26% vs. 5%, P<0.0001), and had taken more sick leaves (17% vs. 5%, P=0.018) compared with those without gastroesophageal reflux disease. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of life and psychologic impact of patients with NCCP were as significant as those with CCP. NCCP patients with reflux symptoms were more anxious and were impaired in their productivity and social life. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

69249188303	Three estimates of the association between linear growth failure and cognitive ability	Objectives To compare three estimators of association between growth stunting as measured by height-for-age Z-score and cognitive ability in children, and to examine the extent statistical adjustment for covariates is useful for removing confounding due to socio-economic status. Methods Three estimators, namely random-effects, within- and between-cluster estimators, for panel data were used to estimate the association in a survey of 1105 pairs of siblings who were assessed for anthropometry and cognition. Furthermore, a 'combined' model was formulated to simultaneously provide the within- and between-cluster estimates. Results Random-effects and between-cluster estimators showed strong association between linear growth and cognitive ability, even after adjustment for a range of socio-economic variables. In contrast, the within-cluster estimator showed a much more modest association: For every increase of one Z-score in linear growth, cognitive ability increased by about 0.08 standard deviation (P < 0.001). The combined model verified that the between-cluster estimate was significantly larger than the within-cluster estimate (P = 0.004). Conclusion Residual confounding by socio-economic situations may explain a substantial proportion of the observed association between linear growth and cognition in studies that attempt to control the confounding by means of multivariable regression analysis. The within-cluster estimator provides more convincing and modest results about the strength of association. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

70450186219	Pattern of arterial calcification in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus	Objective. To evaluate the prevalence and pattern of arterial calcification in patients with asymptomatic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared with control subjects. SLE patients are prone to adverse cardiovascular events; however, the underlying atherosclerotic process is unknown. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) measured arterial calcium score (CS) reflecting underlying atherosclerosis and is closely associated with cardiovascular events. Methods. Fifty age and sex matched SLE patients and controls were enrolled. All subjects underwent 64 slice MDCT scan to evaluate CS in coronary, carotid arteries and the aorta. Results. As compared with controls, SLE patients had higher mean CS and prevalence of CS > 0 across all vascular beds. After adjustment for age and sex, SLE patient odds of having CS > 0 in any vascular bed was 33.6 (95% CI: 9.5-165.2) were higher versus patients in the control group, mainly due to more prevalent coronary calcification (OR 30.0, 95% CI: 6.7-203.8). In SLE patients, the most frequent vessel with CS > 0 was coronary (42%) followed by carotid artery (24%). Further, arterial calcification occurred early involving 40% of SLE patients at age < 40 years , with increasing prevalence as age advanced. Conclusion. Our study confirms that patients with SLE have significantly higher prevalence and extent of systemic arterial calcification compared with age and sex matched controls.

0035293623	Marginal Likelihood Estimation for Proportional Odds Models with Right Censored Data	One major aspect in medical research is to relate the survival times of patients with the relevant covariates or explanatory variables. The proportional hazards model has been used extensively in the past decades with the assumption that the covariate effects act multiplicatively on the hazard function, independent of time. If the patients become more homogeneous over time, say the treatment effects decrease with time or fade out eventually, then a proportional odds model may be more appropriate. In the proportional odds model, the odds ratio between patients can be expressed as a function of their corresponding covariate vectors, in which, the hazard ratio between individuals converges to unity in the long run. In this paper, we consider the estimation of the regression parameter for a semiparametric proportional odds model at which the baseline odds function is an arbitrary, non-decreasing function but is left unspecified. Instead of using the exact survival times, only the rank order information among patients is used. A Monte Carlo method is used to approximate the marginal likelihood function of the rank invariant transformation of the survival times which preserves the information about the regression parameter. The method can be applied to other transformation models with censored data such as the proportional hazards model, the generalized probit model or others. The proposed method is applied to the Veteran's Administration lung cancer trial data.

77649197304	A multiple imputation approach for clustered interval-censored survival data	Multivariate interval-censored failure time data arise commonly in many studies of epidemiology and biomedicine. Analysis of these type of data is more challenging than the right-censored data. We propose a simple multiple imputation strategy to recover the order of occurrences based on the interval-censored event times using a conditional predictive distribution function derived from a parametric gamma random effects model. By imputing the interval-censored failure times, the estimation of the regression and dependence parameters in the context of a gamma frailty proportional hazards model using the well-developed EM algorithm is made possible. A robust estimator for the covariance matrix is suggested to adjust for the possible misspecification of the parametric baseline hazard function. The finite sample properties of the proposed method are investigated via simulation. The performance of the proposed method is highly satisfactory, whereas the computation burden is minimal. The proposed method is also applied to the diabetic retinopathy study (DRS) data for illustration purpose and the estimates are compared with those based on other existing methods for bivariate grouped survival data.

77949685550	Role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with coronary calcification	Objective. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are prone to premature atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that depletion of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) related to RA can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Methods. We studied coronary calcifications by multidetector computed tomography and their relationship with different subtypes of circulating EPC in 70 patients with RA and 35 age- and sex-matched controls (mean age 54.1 ± 10.2 yrs, 87% were women). The presence of coronary atherosclerosis was defined as an Agatston score ≥ 10. Four subpopulations of EPC were determined by flow cytometry on the basis of surface expression of CD34, CD133, and KDR antigen: CD34+, CD34/KDR+, CD133+, and CD133/KDR+ EPC, respectively. Results. Among those with RA, 15 patients (21%) had coronary atherosclerosis. The mean Agatston score was higher (61.8 ± 201.7 vs 0.14 ± 0.69; p = 0.01) and coronary atherosclerosis was more prevalent (21.4% vs 0%; p < 0.01) in patients with RA compared to controls. RA patients with coronary atherosclerosis were older (66.2 ± 6.9 vs 51.5 ± 16.2 yrs; p < 0.01), had higher prevalence of hypertension (46.7% vs 14.5%; p = 0.01), and had lower CD133/KDR+ (0.45% ± 0.28% vs 0.89% ± 0.81%; p < 0.01) and CD133+ EPC levels (0.74% ± 0.39% vs 1.22% ± 0.83%; p < 0.01), but similar CD34/KDR+ and CD34+ EPC levels (all p > 0.05) compared to those without. Multiple logistic regression revealed that older age (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.41, p < 0.01) and lower CD133/KDR+ EPC (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00-0.97, p < 0.01) were independent predictors for coronary atherosclerosis in patients with RA. Conclusion. Our results demonstrated that RA patients with coronary atherosclerosis have significantly lower levels of CD133/KDR+ and CD133+ EPC than those without. In addition to older age, lower levels of circulating CD133/KDR+ EPC also predicted occurrence of coronary atherosclerosis in RA patients. The Journal of Rheumatology Copyright © 2010.

77949367335	Psychological well-being of interns in Hong Kong: What causes them stress and what helps them	Background: Many doctors experience psychological ill health. Interns are known to be particularly vulnerable. Aim: To examine the level of depression, anxiety and stress in interns in Hong Kong, as well as the causes and how they cope. Methods: A questionnaire was designed based on the themes identified in three focus groups of medical graduates of Year 2004 of the University of Hong Kong. The 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21) was also administered. All 155 graduates of the same year were invited to participate with a response rate of 63%. Results: Percentages of respondents with abnormal levels of depression, anxiety and stress were 35.8%, 35.4% and 29.2%, respectively. Frequent calls during night shift, long working hours and heavy workload constituted the most significant stressors. Factor analysis of the stressors showed that seven factors could explain 68% of the total variance: multidisciplinary team working issues, clinical difficulties, job seeking and employment, workload issues, ethical and interpersonal issues, adjustment to job rotation and performance appraisal. Holidays, peers and sleep offered the most significant relief. Conclusion: Interns experience considerable depression, anxiety and stress. The source of stress is multi-faceted, but workload is the most significant stressor. Peer support groups may relief stress. © 2010 Informa Healthcare Ltd.

IL-33 has recently been found to be the specific ligand of ST2, an IL-1 receptor family member that is selectively expressed in Th2 cells and mediates Th2 response. This study aims to measure the serum levels of soluble ST2 (sST2) and IL-33 in patients with SLE and to examine their association with disease activity. Methods. Seventy SLE patients were evaluated for disease activity, determined by SLEDAI, levels of anti-dsDNA antibody, C3 and C4. Fifty-seven patients were evaluated longitudinally on a second occasion. IL-33 and sST2 were measured by sandwich ELISA in the 127 SLE serum samples and compared with 28 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Results. Serum sST2 level was significantly higher in active SLE patients [0.51 (0.18) ng/ml] compared with inactive patients [0.42 (0.08) ng/ml] (P = 0.006) and normal controls [0.36 (0.13) ng/ml] (P<0.001). sST2 level correlated significantly with SLEDAI, anti-dsDNA antibody and prednisolone dosage, and negatively with C3. Linear regression analysis showed that serum sST2 level was an independent predictive factor for modified SLEDAI, excluding anti-dsDNA and complement score after controlling for age, sex, glomerular filtration rate and prednisolone dosage (regression coefficient: 8.5; 95% CI 2.6, 14.3) (P = 0.005). Serum sST2 level was sensitive to change in disease activity longitudinally, with an effect size of 0.29. Elevated serum IL-33 was comparable in frequency (4.3 vs 7.1%; P = 0.62) and levels (P = 0.53) between SLE patients and controls. Conclusions. Elevated serum sST2 level in SLE patients was found to correlate with disease activity and was sensitive to change, suggesting a potential role as a surrogate marker of disease activity. © The Author 2009.

77955166368	A simple approach to the estimation of incidence rate difference	The incidence rate difference (IRD) is a parameter of interest in many medical studies. For example, in vaccine studies, it is interpreted as the vaccine-attributable reduction in disease incidence. This is an important parameter, because it shows the public health impact of an intervention. The IRD is difficult to estimate for various reasons, especially when there are quantitative covariates or the duration of follow-up is variable. In this paper, the authors propose an approach based on weighted least-squares regression for estimating the IRD. It is very easy to implement because it boils down to performing ordinary least-squares regression analysis of transformed variables. Furthermore, if the outcome events are repeatable, the authors propose that data on all events be analyzed instead of first events only. Four versions of the Huber-White robust standard error are considered for statistical inference. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of the proposed method. In a variety of scenarios simulated, the method provides an unbiased estimate for the IRD, and the empirical coverage proportion of the 95% confidence interval is very close to the nominal level. The method is illustrated with data from a vaccine trial carried out in the Gambia in 2001-2004. © 2010 The Author.

78650606043	How do patients choose their doctors for primary care in a free market?	Aims A recent trend in health care system is to provide more choices to the patients. This study surveyed the general public's choices for primary care in Hong Kong which has the setting of free choices for private or public service and also direct access to specialists. Methods We used a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. We held five focus group interviews with participants of different socio-economic categories. Information from the focus groups helped to design a questionnaire for random telephone interviews with members of the public aged 18 or above. Results There were 37 participants in the focus groups and 1647 respondents in the telephone survey. The most important factor for choosing a doctor was proximity to home or workplace, followed by quick relief from the illness. Once continuity of care had been established, distance was of less importance but comprehensive care was valued. Nearly 70% of the public had regular doctors. About 93% of the public would consult specialists directly when they thought they needed a specialist's opinion. Nearly 30% chose specialists for any medical care and 38% preferred specialists to also look after their primary care problems. Conclusion Convenient accessibility was the most important factor for the initial choice of primary care doctors by the general public. The perceived clinical proficiency of the doctor determined future continuity of care. Patients liked to have direct access to specialists. Though some chose to see the specialists even for primary care problems, most people had regular doctors who were likely to have the attributes of family doctors. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

78650926518	Analysis of multilevel grouped survival data with time-varying regression coefficients	Correlated or multilevel grouped survival data are common in medical and dental research. Two common approaches to analyze such data are the marginal and the random-effects approaches. Models and methods in the literature generally assume that the treatment effect is constant over time. A researcher may be interested in studying whether the treatment effects in a clinical trial vary over time, say fade out gradually. This is of particular clinical value when studying the long-term effect of a treatment. This paper proposed to extend the random effects grouped proportional hazards models by incorporating the possibly time-varying covariate effects into the model in terms of a state-space formulation. The proposed model is very flexible and the estimation can be performed using the MCMC approach with non-informative priors in the Bayesian framework. The method is applied to a data set from a prospective clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) and sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish in arresting active dentin caries in the Chinese preschool children. It is shown that the treatment groups with caries removal prior to the topical fluoride applications are most effective in shortening the arrest times in the first 6-month interval, but their effects fade out rapidly since then. The effects of treatment groups without caries removal prior to topical fluoride application drop at a very slow rate and can be considered as more or less constant over time. The applications of SDF solution is found to be more effective than the applications of NaF vanish. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

79251497685	Introducing family medicine in a pluralistic health care system: How patients and doctors see it	Background: The health care systems in many countries are focused on specialist care. In those countries that have recently changed to a primary care-based system, some doctors and patients were dissatisfied with the change. Objective: To explore the opinions of the general public and the doctors on the change to a family medicine (FM)-based health care system. Methods: Qualitative study with focus groups of doctors working in different practice settings. Quantitative study with questionnaires sent to all doctors registered in Hong Kong and a telephone survey targeting the general public aged >18. Results: Doctors in the focus groups generally supported a FM-based health care system. They were concerned that there were not enough family doctors for such a system and the patients' current free choice of any doctor for primary care would impede its success. Thousand six hundred and forty-seven adults took part in the telephone survey (response rate 67.6%) and 2310 doctors (22.8%) responded to the questionnaire. Nearly 95% of the general public respondents agreed to the FM system though only 66.3% of them had ever heard of the term family doctor. About 65% of the doctors supported this system but only 33% agreed that the system would work. The specialist-doctors were less supportive of mandatory referral than the non-specialists, while the public was equally divided on this issue. Conclusions: The public accepts the FM-based system but needs education on the benefits of primary health care. Direct access to the specialist would be the greatest barrier. Government involvements are essential for the reform. © The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

79951492685	Family medicine training in Hong Kong: Similarities and differences between family and non-family doctors	Objective: To study the local medical profession's opinions on the training requirements for the specialty of family medicine. This was to serve as a reference for future planning of the health care system. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and Setting: All registered doctors in Hong Kong. Main outcome measures: Doctors' ratings on the importance of vocational training, professional assessment, job nature, and experience to become suitably qualified as a family doctor, and their opinions on the length of necessary vocational training. Results: A total of 2310 doctors (23% of doctors in the local register) responded. Professional assessment was mostly agreed as a qualification, followed by vocational training, clinical experience, and job nature. Over 70% agreed on a training period of 4 years or less. Non-family doctors were more likely to opt for professional assessment as the qualification and also opt for a longer training period. Conclusion: Vocational training was considered important as a qualification for the specialty of family medicine. The length of training was mostly agreed to be 4 years or less, not the 6 years currently required by the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine. The vocational training programme for family medicine might require reexamination.

79953086354	Evaluation of the learning outcomes of a year-long postgraduate training course in community geriatrics for primary care doctors	There are increasing expectations on primary care doctors to shoulder a bigger share of care for patients with common geriatric problems in the community. This study aims to examine the outcomes of a postgraduate training course in geriatrics for primary care doctors. A questionnaire developed by the research team was sent to the course graduates (years 2001-2007). Ninety-eight replies were received with a response rate of 52.4% (98/187). Difference in the ratings by the respondents before and after taking the course was analyzed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Most respondents felt more rewarding and had participated more in geriatric care, and the majority had improvement in their communication skills with elderly patients after taking the course. Moreover, the graduates are more confident in diagnosing and managing common geriatric problems, and deciding to which specialty to refer the elderly patients. Of the referrals, there was a significant increase to private geriatricians and a significant reduction to other specialists. The average number of elderly patients seen per day had also increased. However, little change was observed about making nursing home visits, the frequency of which remained low. Many graduates expressed difficulties in conducting nursing home visits. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

79955921195	What are the learning outcomes of a short postgraduate training course in dermatology for primary care doctors?	Background: There are increasing expectations on primary care doctors to shoulder a bigger share of care for patients with common dermatological problems in the community. This study examined the learning outcomes of a short postgraduate course in dermatology for primary care doctors. Methods: A self-reported questionnaire developed by the research team was sent to the Course graduates. A retrospective design was adopted to compare their clinical practice characteristics before and after the Course. Differences in the ratings were analysed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate the effectiveness of the Course in various aspects. Results: Sixty-nine graduates replied with a response rate of 42.9% (69/161). Most were confident of diagnosing (91.2%) and managing (88.4%) common dermatological problems after the Course, compared to 61.8% and 58.0% respectively before the Course. Most had also modified their approach and increased their attention to patients with dermatological problems. The number of patients with dermatological problems seen by the graduates per day showed significant increase after the Course, while the average percentage of referrals to dermatologists dropped from 31.9% to 23.5%. The proportion of graduates interested in following up patients with chronic dermatological problems increased from 60.3% to 77.9%. Conclusions: Graduates of the Course reported improved confidence, attitudes and skills in treating common dermatological problems. They also reported to handle more patients with common dermatological problems in their practice and refer fewer patients. © 2011 Lam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79955936653	Reasons for preferring a primary care physician for care if depressed	BACKGROUND: Most studies showed that patients would first go to their primary care physicians (PCPs) when depressed. This choice is probably due to PCP being the entry point into the health care system. We studied the general population's initial choice of mental care in Hong Kong, where patients were unclear about family medicine and free to choose doctors of any specialty. METHODS: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was adopted. We held focus groups with participants recruited from community centers and a telephone survey with adults ages 18 or above randomly selected from the domestic telephone directory. RESULTS: Of 1,647 adults successfully interviewed, 49.0% would seek help from their regular PCP, 19.3% from psychiatrists, 4.8% from any doctors, 16.5% from non-medical resources; 6.9% would not seek any help, and 3.5% were uncertain of what to do. Those who did not seek any help were more likely to be male or without regular doctors. The focus group participants highlighted the stigmatizing effect of consulting psychiatrists and expressed strong expectation of empathic relationship, time, and communication skills from their care providers. Some participants were not aware that PCP could manage mental illness. CONCLUSIONS: Given free choice of health care service, most people would first consult their regular doctors for treatment of depression specifically because of better relationship and no stigmatization. To draw depressed patients to seek help, especially from primary care, public education of the PCPs role in mental health should be promoted, and the PCPs could demonstrate their empathy and listening skills to patients.

0035656099	Dynamic Random Effects Models for Times between Repeated Events	We consider recurrent event data when the duration or gap times between successive event occurrences are of intrinsic interest. Subject heterogeneity not attributed to observed covariates is usually handled by random effects which result in an exchangeable correlation structure for the gap times of a subject. Recently, efforts have been put into relaxing this restriction to allow non-exchangeable correlation. Here we consider dynamic models where random effects can vary stochastically over the gap times. We extend the traditional Gaussian variance components models and evaluate a previously proposed proportional hazards model through a simulation study and some examples. Besides, semiparametric estimation of the proportional hazards models is considered. Both models are easily used. The Gaussian models are easily interpreted in terms of the variance structure. On the other hand, the proportional hazards models would be more appropriate in the context of survival analysis, particularly in the interpretation of the regression parameters. They can be sensitive to the choice of model for random effects but not to the choice of the baseline hazard function.

0035989810	Modeling multivariate survival data by a semiparametric random effects proportional odds model	In this article, the focus is on the analysis of multivariate survival time data with various types of dependence structures. Examples of multivariate survival data include clustered data and repeated measurements from the same subject, such as the interrecurrence times of cancer tumors. A random effect semiparametric proportional odds model is proposed as an alternative to the proportional hazards model. The distribution of the random effects is assumed to be multivariate normal and the random effect is assumed to act additively to the baseline log-odds function. This class of models, which includes the usual shared random effects model, the additive variance components model, and the dynamic random effects model as special cases, is highly flexible and is capable of modeling a wide range of multivariate survival data. A unified estimation procedure is proposed to estimate the regression and dependence parameters simultaneously by means of a marginal-likelihood approach. Unlike the fully parametric case, the regression parameter estimate is not sensitive to the choice of correlation structure of the random effects. The marginal likelihood is approximated by the Monte Carlo method. Simulation studies are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed method is applied to two well-known data sets, including clustered data and recurrent event times data.

0036282423	Kernel method for the estimation of the distribution function and the mean with auxiliary information in ranked set sampling	The method of ranked set sampling is widely applicable in environmental research mainly in the estimation of the mean and distribution function of the variable of interest, Y. Ranking of the Ys by visual judgment may be imperfect sometimes. When the Ys are expensive to measure, it would be more convenient to determine the 'rankings' of the Ys by a concomitant variable, X, which is relatively easy and cheap to make measurements. The information carried in X is not utilized in all estimation methods available in the literature except in determining the rankings of Ys unless extra distributional or linearity assumptions are made. However, these assumptions may be too stringent in environmental research. Nonparametric estimators for the distribution function and the mean of Y utilizing the concomitant variable and auxiliary information in a ranked set sampling setup are proposed in this article. The estimators are robust to model misspecification, and the performance of the estimators is highly satisfactory, supported by some simulation studies. The estimators are applied to a real data set to estimate the mean and distribution function of plutonium concentration in surface soil on the Nevada Test Site, Nevada, U.S.A.

0036301964	The Hong Kong index of dyspepsia: A validated symptom severity questionnaire for patients with dyspepsia	Aim: Locally validated symptom questionnaires are essential instruments in dyspepsia research. A symptom score for Chinese dyspeptics was developed. Multiple aspects of validity and reliability were assessed. Methods: Sixty-five patients with endoscopy-negative dyspepsia and 65 healthy controls were presented with a list of 24 previously determined common abdominal symptoms and asked to rate the severity in a five point Likert scale. Comprehensibility and relevance of symptoms were assessed. The questionnaire was administered 3 h later to assess for reproducibility. A locally validated Short Form-36 quality-of-life questionnaire was also administered. Cisapride 5 mg thrice daily was prescribed to dyspeptic patients but not to the controls. The dyspepsia symptom and SF-36 questionnaires were repeated after 3 weeks for patients under treatment. Global change in symptoms and the need for further medical care were assessed. Concept, content, construct and criterion validity, consistency and reproducibility of the dyspepsia symptom questionnaire were assessed. Results: All items were considered comprehensible by more than 90% of subjects. Relevance of individual symptoms to dyspeptic patients ranged from 10.8-76.9%. Twelve items were selected by logistic regression to account for most of the differences between control and dyspeptic patients. Test-retest reproducibility and internal consistency were good with the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89 and Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.90. A cut-off score of equal to or greater than 16 was determined to discriminate between controls and dyspeptic patients. The dyspepsia score correlated negatively with all domains of the SF-36 quality of life scale except physical functioning. The dyspepsia questionnaire also discriminated between patients who reported a subjective improvement in symptoms and those who reported no change or worsening. Conclusions: The dyspepsia symptom index was easy to understand, internally consistent and reproducible. It predicted global symptom change, and the symptom severity scores correlated negatively with quality of life. © 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

0036715573	Generalized Supremum Tests for the Equality of Cause Specific Hazard Rates	In this paper we propose two new classes of asymptotically distribution-free Renyi-type tests for testing the equality of two risks in a competing risk model with possible censoring. This work extends the work of Aly, Kochar and McKeague [1994, Journal of American Statistical Association, 89, 994-999] and many of the existing tests for this problem belong to these newly proposed classes. The asymptotic properties of the proposed tests are investigated. Simulation studies are done to compare the performance with existing tests. A competing risks data set is analyzed to demonstrate the usefulness of the procedure.

81255214744	Effect of esomeprazole versus famotidine on platelet inhibition by clopidogrel: A double-blind, randomized trial	Background: Previous studies showed that esomeprazole does not interfere significantly with the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, interacts with clopidogrel. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the influence of esomeprazole and famotidine on the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. Methods: Patients with acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary interventions treated with aspirin and clopidogrel cotherapy were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or famotidine 40 mg daily. Platelet reactivity units (PRUs) were measured at baseline and on day 28. The primary analysis involved the PRU values on day 28. Results: There were 44 patients in the esomeprazole group and 44 in the famotidine group. The baseline PRUs of the 2 groups were comparable (esomeprazole vs famotidine, 229.1 ± 85.6 vs 220.4 ± 83.0, P =.63). The PRUs on day 28 were 242.6 ± 89.7 and 237.5 ± 79.2 in the groups receiving esomeprazole and famotidine, respectively (mean difference 5.1, 95% CI -30.8 to 41.0, P =.78). Conclusions: The platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was not significantly different between patients receiving esomeprazole and those receiving famotidine. Neither esomeprazole nor famotidine reduced the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

81855194379	On the local polynomial estimators of the counting process intensity function and its derivatives	We consider the properties of the local polynomial estimators of a counting process intensity function and its derivatives. By expressing the local polynomial estimators in a kernel smoothing form via effective kernels, we show that the bias and variance of the estimators at boundary points are of the same magnitude as at interior points and therefore the local polynomial estimators in the context of intensity estimation also enjoy the automatic boundary correction property as they do in other contexts such as regression. The asymptotically optimal bandwidths and optimal kernel functions are obtained through the asymptotic expressions of the mean square error of the estimators. For practical purpose, we suggest an effective and easy-to-calculate data-driven bandwidth selector. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the performance of the local polynomial estimators and the proposed bandwidth selector. The estimators and the bandwidth selector are applied to estimate the rate of aftershocks of the Sichuan earthquake and the rate of the Personal Emergency Link calls in Hong Kong. © 2011 Board of the Foundation of the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics.

83655164624	What do primary care doctors get out of a year-long postgraduate course in community psychological medicine	Objective: There are increasing expectations on primary care doctors to care for patients with common mental health problems. This study examines the outcomes of a postgraduate training course in psychological medicine for primary care doctors. Methods: A questionnaire developed by the research team was sent to the Course graduates (year 2003-2007). A retrospective design was adopted to compare their clinical practice characteristics before and after the Course. Differences in the ratings by the respondents before and after the Course were analyzed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Sixty-nine graduates replied with a response rate of 58.5% (69/118). Most respondents were confident of diagnosing (96.9%) and managing (97.0%) common mental health problems after the Course, compared to 50.0% and 50.7%, respectively, before the Course. Most graduates had modified their approach, increased their attention and empathy to patients with mental health problems. The percentage of respondents having enough time to treat these patients had increased from 55.8% to 72.1%. The median number of patients with mental health problems seen per week was in the range of 3-6 before, and had increased to the range of 7-10 after the Course. The proportion of respondents being confident of making appropriate referrals had increased from 72.8% to 97.0%, while the number of referrals to psychiatrists had dropped significantly. Conclusions: The Course is effective in improving graduates' confidence, attitude, and skills in treating patients with common mental health problems. There are significant increases in the number of mental health patients handled, increased confidence in making referrals to psychiatrists, and decreased percentage of patients being referred. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

84857910372	Esomeprazole compared with famotidine in the prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction	Objectives: Little is known about the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors compared with H 2 receptor antagonists in preventing adverse upper gastrointestinal complications in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin or thrombolytics. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacies of esomeprazole and famotidine in preventing gastrointestinal complications. Methods: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was performed in patients receiving a combination of aspirin, clopidogrel, and either enoxaparin or thrombolytics. Patients received either esomeprazole (20 mg nocte) or famotidine (40 mg nocte) orally for 4-52 weeks, depending on the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The primary end point was upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), perforation, or obstruction from ulcer/erosion (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00683111). Results: In all, 311 patients were recruited, with 163 and 148 patients in the esomeprazole and famotidine groups, respectively. Mean (s.d.) follow-up was 19.2 (17.6) and 17.6 (18.0) weeks, respectively. One (0.6%) patient in the esomeprazole group and 9 (6.1%) in the famotidine group reached the primary end point (log-rank test, P=0.0052, hazard ratio0.095, 95% confidence interval: 0.005-0.504); all had upper GIB. Conclusions: In patients with ACS or STEMI, esomeprazole is superior to famotidine in preventing upper gastrointestinal complications related to aspirin, clopidogrel, and enoxaparin or thrombolytics. © 2012 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

84862979101	Frequent premature atrial complexes predict new occurrence of atrial fibrillation and adverse cardiovascular events	AimsTo investigate the relation between baseline frequency of premature atrial complexes (PACs) and new atrial fibrillation (AF) and adverse cardiovascular events.Method and resultsFour hundred and twenty-eight patients without AF or structural heart disease undergoing 24 h electrocardiography monitoring for palpitations, dizziness, or syncope were recruited. One hundred and seven patients with number of PACs at the top quartile (i.e. >100PACs/day) were defined to have frequent PACs. After 6.1-year follow-up, 31 patients (29) with frequent PACs developed AF compared with 29 patients (9) with PACs ≤100/day (P< 0.01). Cox regression analysis revealed that frequent PACs [hazard ratio (HR): 3.22 (95 confidence interval (CI): 1.95.5; P< 0.001)], age >75 years (HR: 2.3; 95 CI: 1.33.9; P 0.004), and coronary artery disease (HR: 2.5; 95 CI: 1.44.4; P 0.002) were independent predictors for new AF. Concerning the composite endpoint (ischaemic stroke, heart failure, and death), patients with frequent PACs were more at risk than those without (34.5 vs. 19.3) (HR: 1.95; 95 CI: 1.373.50; P 0.001). Cox regression analysis showed that age >75 years (HR: 2.2; 95 CI: 1.473.41; P< 0.001), coronary artery disease (HR: 2.2, 95 CI: 1.423.44, P< 0.001), and frequent PACs (HR: 1.6; 95 CI: 1.042.44; P 0.03) were independent predictors for the secondary composite endpoint.ConclusionFrequent PACs predict new AF and adverse cardiovascular events.

0036909537	Anxiety but not depression determines health care-seeking behaviour in Chinese patients with dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome: A population-based study	Aims: To study the prevalence of dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome and the effects of co-existing anxiety and depression on health care utilization by a population survey in Chinese. Methods: Ethnic Chinese households were invited to participate in a telephone survey using a validated bowel symptom questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Gastrointestinal symptoms were classified as dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome according to the Rome I criteria and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease by the presence of weekly heartburn or acid regurgitation. The anxiety and depression scores were compared between patients who sought medical attention and those who did not, using multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: One thousand, six hundred and forty-nine subjects completed the interview (response rate, 62%). The population prevalences of dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were 18.4%, 4.1% and 4.8%, respectively. Dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome were associated with anxiety, depression, medical consultation, sick leave and adverse effects on social life. The degree of anxiety was an independent factor associated with health care-seeking behaviour in both dyspeptics (P = 0.003) and irritable bowel syndrome patients (P = 0.036). Conclusions: Irritable bowel syndrome and dyspepsia are associated with anxiety, depression, significant social morbidity, health care utilization and days off work. Anxiety is an independent factor in determining health care utilization in patients with dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

0037397770	Why do family doctors prescribe antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection?	The prescribing behaviour of family doctors in Hong Kong towards upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), and the major clinical factors that might affect such behaviour, were studied. Members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians were surveyed; 801 completed the questionnaire with an overall response rate of 65%. Purulent nasal discharge, purulent sputum, persistent fever over three days, patients looking unwell, exudates on throat, inflamed eardrums and cervical lymphadenopathy made more than half the respondents 'likely' or 'very likely' to prescribe antibiotics. Those in private practice and those who graduated in Hong Kong were more likely to prescribe antibiotics, while fellows of the College were less likely to do so. Vocational training and higher qualifications in family medicine/general practice, however, revealed minimal effect. Our results showed that many doctors are still prescribing antibiotics when they encounter URTI patients presenting with clinical factors that have been proven to have no or little benefit from antibiotics.

0037529418	REML and ML estimation for clustered grouped survival data	Clustered grouped survival data arise naturally in clinical medicine and biological research. For example, in a randomized clinical trial, the variable of interest is the time to occurrence of a certain event with or without a new treatment and the data are collected from possibly correlated subjects from independent clusters. However it is sometimes impossible or too expensive to monitor the experimental subjects continuously. The subjects are examined regularly and the continuous survival data are thus grouped into a discrete time scale. With such a design, researchers are mainly interested in the effectiveness of the new treatment as well as the correlation among subjects from the same cluster, namely the intracluster correlation. This paper suggests a random effects approach to the estimation of the regression parameter with various choices of regression model and also the dependence parameter which characterizes the intracluster correlation. Time dependent covariates can be accommodated in the proposed model, and the estimation procedure will not be further complicated with large cluster sizes. The proposed method is applied to the data from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, the objective of which is to evaluate the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation in delaying or preventing the onset of blindness in the left and right eyes of individuals with diabetes-associated retinopathy. The intracluster correlation using a grouped proportional hazards regression model can be estimated and the relationship between the regression parameter estimates based on the random effects approach and the marginal approach using a dynamic logistic regression model are discussed.

0037757976	A validated symptoms questionnaire (Chinese GERDQ) for the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in the Chinese population	Background and aims: To develop a validated gastrooesophageal disease (GERD) symptom questionnaire for the Chinese population. Methods: One hundred Chinese patients with GERD and 101 healthy Chinese controls were presented with a 20-item GERD questionnaire in the Chinese language (Chinese GERDQ). Quality of life in GERD patients was assessed by SF-36. A standard dose of proton pump inhibitors for 4 weeks was prescribed to 35 patients with newly diagnosed GERD. The Chinese GERDQ was performed before. 4 weeks and 8 weeks after treatment. Concept, content, construct, discriminant validity and reliability of the questionnaire were assessed. Results: Seven items were selected by logistic regression to account for most of the differences between controls and GERD patients with a good reproducibility and internal consistency. A cut-off score of equal or greater than 12 was determined to discriminate between controls and GERD patients with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 84%. The Chinese GERDQ correlated negatively with five domains of the SF-36 and discriminated between GERD patients who reported symptomatic improvement during proton pump inhibitor treatment and symptoms deterioration upon withdrawal of proton pump inhibitor treatment. Conclusions: The Chinese GERDQ could be used in epidemiological studies to assess the frequency and severity of GERD in patient populations and in interventional studies of GERD.

0038817847	What are the non-biomedical reasons which make family doctors over-prescribe antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection in a mixed private/public Asian setting?	Objectives: To examine the non-biomedical reasons which make family doctors over-prescribe antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in a mixed private/public Asian setting. Methods: The questionnaire was sent to the members of the Hong Kong College of Family Physicians between August and December 2001. Results: A total of 801 family doctors completed a postal questionnaire with an overall response rate of 65.0%. A significant number of respondents (21.8%) felt they might be prescribing antibiotics too often for URTI but the majority of them felt they were using antibiotics just a bit too often. Doctors who were older, more senior or in private practice were more likely to feel that they might be prescribing antibiotics too often. More than 50% of respondents thought that to satisfy the patient or his/her carer and fear of medicolegal problem if the patient deteriorates would make them very likely or likely to over-prescribe antibiotics for patients with URTIs. Public doctors might over-prescribe in order to save time, whereas private doctors might do so in order to keep patients in their practice. Conclusion: The results showed that doctors with certain characteristics are more likely to overprescribe antibiotics. Factors, other than biomedical ones, may play important roles in doctor's prescription of antibiotics for URTI.

0038909446	A nonparametric inference procedure for an illness-death model	Methods of nonparametric inference are proposed for a process with two transient and three absorbing states. It is assumed that the times of transitions between the transient states are unobservable. One area of application is in epidemiology where the transient states correspond to healthy and ill, while the absorbing states correspond to types of death. It is the time of onset of illness which is assumed unobservable. Here we use the martingale theory to make inference about the cumulative hazard rate of the onset of the disease. The assumption of equality of hazard rates from the other causes with or without the disease is not needed. Instead, an assumption of proportionality between the two rates is made. A simulation study is given to compare the suggested procedure and the Nelson-Aalen estimator which requires complete observation of process.

84867929558	Estimation and interpretation of incidence rate difference for recurrent events when the estimation model is misspecified	Recurrent events data are common in experimental and observational studies. It is often of interest to estimate the effect of an intervention on the incidence rate of the recurrent events. The incidence rate difference is a useful measure of intervention effect. A weighted least squares estimator of the incidence rate difference for recurrent events was recently proposed for an additive rate model in which both the baseline incidence rate and the covariate effects were constant over time. In this article, we relax this model assumption and examine the properties of the estimator under the additive and multiplicative rate models assumption in which the baseline incidence rate and covariate effects may vary over time. We show analytically and numerically that the estimator gives an appropriate summary measure of the time-varying covariate effects. In particular, when the underlying covariate effects are additive and time-varying, the estimator consistently estimates the weighted average of the covariate effects over time. When the underlying covariate effects are multiplicative and time-varying, and if there is only one binary covariate indicating the intervention status, the estimator consistently estimates the weighted average of the underlying incidence rate difference between the intervention and control groups over time. We illustrate the method with data from a randomized vaccine trial. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84869459712	Antibiotic use: Do parents act differently for their children?	Background: Many children in the community take antibiotics inappropriately. Previous studies comparing parents with other adults suggest that parents are more judicious with antibiotics for their children. This study aims to explore the difference between parents' use of antibiotics for themselves and for their children. Methods: The study adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. Eight focus groups were conducted with 56 participants purposively recruited from community centres and of different socio-economic strata. The qualitative data collected were used to construct a questionnaire for the telephone survey, which recruited 2471 adults randomly selected from the local household directory, of whom 547 had ever brought their children or grand children for medical consultation. Results: Both the qualitative and quantitative approaches showed that parents were more cautious with antibiotics for children than for themselves. The main reason was their concern of side effects. Fever was the most important drive for their desire of antibiotics for children. The misconception of antibiotics' effectiveness for sore throat was another determinant of the desire. These attitudes and behaviour were not affected by the respondents' sex, age, education or household income. Conclusion: On the whole, parents did to their children what they would do for themselves, but to a lesser extent. Parents' better knowledge and attitudes will lead to more appropriate use of antibiotics for their children. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84868695471	Western mental health training for Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners	Objective: To investigate the impact of a Western mental health training course for Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioners. Method: A combined qualitative and quantitative approach was applied to examine the changes in the TCM practitioners' clinical practice characteristics and attitudes. Focus groups and structured questionnaire surveys were conducted to compare their responses before and after the Course. Results: After a 10-week training course conducted by psychiatrists and family physicians, there were significant changes in confidence of the TCM practitioners for diagnosis (33% being confident before the Course vs. 76% after the Course) and management (24% vs. 55%) of common mental health problems. The causal effects of better classifications to recognition of mental health problems were explained by the qualitative responses. Proportion of TCM practitioners being confident of referring mental health patients to other healthcare professionals doubled from 25% to 50% after the Course. Nonetheless, there was no significant change in percentage of these patients being recommended to Western doctors owing to a lack of formal referral channel. Conclusions: Western mental health training for TCM practitioners has positive impact on their clinical practice. However, the practical barriers in making referrals highlight the need of closer collaboration between conventional and traditional medicine. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84869792154	Sudden cardiac death after myocardial infarction in type 2 diabetic patients with no residual myocardial ischemia	OBJECTIVE - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a well-established risk factor for coronary artery disease. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether DM contributes to sudden cardiac death in patients who survive myocardial infarction (MI). The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of sudden cardiac death post-MI in diabetic and nondiabetic patients with no residual myocardial ischemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A total of 610 consecutive post-MI patients referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program with negative exercise stress test were studied. RESULTS - Of these, 236 patients had DM at baseline. Over a mean follow-up of 5 years, 67 patients with DM (28.4%) and 76 of 374 patients without DM (20.2%) had died with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.74 (95%CI: 1.28-2.56; P< 0.001). Patients with DMalso had a higher incidence of cardiac death (1.84 [1.16-3.21]; P = 0.01), principally due to a higher incidence of sudden cardiac death (2.14 [1.22-4.23]; P < 0.001). Multiple Cox regression analysis revealed that only DM (adjusted HR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.04-3.40]; P = 0.04), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 30% (3.6 [1.46-8.75]; P < 0.01), and New York Heart Association functional class >II (4.2 [1.87-9.45]; P < 0.01) were independent predictors for sudden cardiac death. Among patients with DM, the 5-year sudden cardiac death rate did not differ significantly among thosewith LVEF ≤30%, LVEF 31-50%, or LVEF >50% (8.8 vs. 7.8 vs. 6.8%, respectively; P = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS - Post-MI patients with DM, even in the absence of residual myocardial ischemia clinically, were at higher risk of sudden cardiac death than their non-DM counterparts. © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.

84870058766	Estimation of summary protective efficacy using a frailty mixture model for recurrent event time data	Recurrent event time data are common in experimental and observational studies. The analytic strategy needs to consider three issues: within-subject event dependence, between-subject heterogeneity in event rates, and the possibility of a nonsusceptible fraction. Motivated by the need to estimate the summary protective efficacy from recurrent event time data as seen in many infectious disease clinical trials, we propose a two-part frailty mixture model that simultaneously accommodates all the three issues. In terms of vaccine action models, the proposed model is a combination of the 'all-or-none' and the 'leaky' models, and the summary protective efficacy is a unified measure of the vaccine's twofold effects in completely or partially protecting the vaccinated individuals against the study event. The model parameters of interest are estimated using the expectation-maximization algorithm with their respective variances estimated using Louis's formula for the expectation-maximization algorithm. The summary protective efficacy is estimated by a composite estimand with its variance estimated using the delta method. The performance of the proposed estimation approach is investigated by a simulation study. Data from a trial of malaria prophylaxis conducted in Ghana are reanalyzed. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84874529392	The public's perspectives on antibiotic resistance and abuse among Chinese in Hong Kong	Purpose: Antibiotic abuse and resistance impose a continuing threat to the world. The awareness of antibiotic resistance is said to be inversely associated with the prevalence of abuse. We examined the public's perspectives on antibiotic resistance in our study of the public's knowledge, attitude and practice with antibiotics. Methods: The study adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach. Eight focus groups were conducted with 56 participants purposively selected from community centres and of different socio-economic strata. The qualitative data collected were used to construct a questionnaire for the telephone survey which surveyed 2471 adults from randomly selected residential numbers. Results: The focus-group participants were unclear about the nature and causes of antibiotic resistance; they also attributed antibiotic abuse to the doctors' responsibility. Of the questionnaire respondents, 9.0% had not heard of the term, 7.8% had ever acquired non-prescribed antibiotics, 6.6% had ever kept the leftover and only 69.8% had always finished the full course of antibiotics. Furthermore, 77.3 % and 75.1%, respectively, agreed that the purchase of antibiotics without prescription and incomplete courses of antibiotics would lead to undesirable consequences. Of the respondents who had heard about antibiotic resistance, 38.7% agreed that they could help the prevention of resistance. They were more likely to complete the full course of antibiotics and less likely to keep the leftovers. Conclusions: The public in general was not aware of the causes of, nor their role and capability in preventing, antibiotic resistance. Future campaigns and health education should empower everyone to restrain antibiotic resistance. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84874316173	Attitudes of primary care physicians towards patients with mental illness in Hong Kong	Introduction: This study aims to describe the attitudes of primary care physicians towards mental health patients in Hong Kong, especially to examine the doctors' views on schizophrenia and depression, and the influence of their demographic variables. Methods: A questionnaire developed by the research team was sent to members of Hong Kong College of Family Physicians. Potential respondents were allocated on equal basis to one of the two sets of questionnaire, set 1 for clinical vignette of schizophrenia and set 2 for depression. Results: A response rate of 37% (500 of 1,360) was achieved. There were 255 and 245 returned questionnaires for set 1 and set 2, respectively. Comparing the two clinical vignettes, there were large differences in their willingness to have the patient on practice list for mental issues (40.0% for schizophrenia versus 71.5% for depression) and to deal with the patient's needs (37.0% versus 60.9%). Multiple ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that doctors with the following demographic factors tended to have more worries or stigma on mental health patients: "having longer years of practice," "being female," "working in hospital," "employed in public sector," and "not having a relative/friend with mental health problems." Discussion: Our study shows that two-thirds of primary care doctors are prepared to look after patients with depression, which is substantially higher than that for schizophrenia. In contrast with the Australian findings, the experienced doctors in Hong Kong have more negative attitudes towards mental health patients than the younger ones. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84875232768	Modeling zero-inflated count data using a covariate-dependent random effect model	In various medical related researches, excessive zeros, which make the standard Poisson regression model inadequate, often exist in count data. We proposed a covariate-dependent random effect model to accommodate the excess zeros and the heterogeneity in the population simultaneously. This work is motivated by a data set from a survey on the dental health status of Hong Kong preschool children where the response variable is the number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth. The random effect has a sound biological interpretation as the overall oral health status or other personal qualities of an individual child that is unobserved and unable to be quantified easily. The overall measure of oral health status, responsible for accommodating the excessive zeros and also the heterogeneity among the children, is covariate dependent. This covariate-dependent random effect model allows one to distinguish whether a potential covariate has an effect on the conceived overall oral health condition of the children, that is, the random effect, or has a direct effect on the magnitude of the counts, or both. We proposed a multiple imputation approach for estimation of the parameters. We discussed the choice of the imputation size. We evaluated the performance of the proposed estimation method through simulation studies, and we applied the model and method to the dental data. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84879424212	A long non-coding RNA signature in glioblastoma multiforme predicts survival	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the leading edge of cancer research, and have been implicated in cancer biogenesis and prognosis. We aimed to identify lncRNA signatures that have prognostic values in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Using a lncRNA-mining approach, we performed lncRNA expression profiling in 213 GBM tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), randomly divided into a training (n. = 107) and a testing set (n. = 106). We analyzed the associations between lncRNA signatures and clinical outcome in the training set, and validated the findings in the testing set. We also validated the identified lncRNA signature in another two independent GBM data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which contained specimens from 68 and 101 patients, respectively. We identified a set of six lncRNAs that were significantly associated with the overall survival in the training set (P≤ 0.01). Based on this six-lncRNA signature, the training-set patients could be classified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with significantly different survival (HR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.38-3.29; P= 0.001). The prognostic value of this six-lncRNA signature was confirmed in the testing set and the two independent data sets. Further analysis revealed that the prognostic value of this signature was independent of age and O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status. The identification of the prognostic lncRNAs indicates the potential roles of lncRNAs in GBM pathogenesis. This six-lncRNA signature may have clinical implications in the subclassification of GBM. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84880642819	The Chinese medicine construct "stagnation" in mind-body connection mediates the effects of mindfulness training on depression and anxiety	Objectives: Previous studies have identified different, but highly correlated variables explaining the effects of mindfulness training. Many of them are limited by tautological explanation. Under the framework of the mind-body connection, mindfulness training cultivates body awareness and promotes self-management of illness. Stagnation, a concept from Chinese medicine, may help explain the mechanism of change in mindfulness training. Methods: Individuals with depressive and anxiety symptoms (n= 82) were randomized to either a Compassion-Mindfulness Therapy (C-MT) program or a waitlist control condition. The effect of stagnation as a mediator was investigated for dependent variables including depression, anxiety, and other physical and mental health variables. Major outcome measures: Depression, anxiety, stagnation, physical distress, daily functioning, positive affect, negative affect. Results: Compared with the participants in the control group, those who completed C-MT demonstrated significant decreases in depression, F(1, 78) = 15.67, p< .001, anxiety, F(1, 78) = 7.72, p< .001, stagnation, F(1, 78) = 4.96, p< .001, and other body-mind-spirit well-being measures. After entering the change in stagnation as the mediator, the effect of treatment reduced: depression (35-22), anxiety (33-05), and same patterns in other three secondary measures. The Sobel test was administered and significant reductions between group and depression (z= 2.18, p= .029), anxiety (z= 2.21, p= .027), and three secondary other measures (p< .05) were indicated. Conclusion: The study provides initial support for the role of stagnation in mediating changes in mindfulness training. It adds evidence to body-mind nondualism and offers new possibilities in studying treatment process and change mechanism. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880928795	Sex knowledge, attitudes, and high-risk sexual behaviors among unmarried youth in Hong Kong	Background: Little is known about sex knowledge, attitudes, and high-risk sexual behaviors among unmarried youth in Hong Kong. It is of public health importance to investigate this topic to inform sex education, policymaking, and prevention and intervention programs. Methods. Based on the Youth Sexuality Survey conducted by Hong Kong Family Planning Association (FPAHK) in 2011, this study explored the characteristics of sexual knowledge, attitudes, and high-risk sexual behaviors among 1,126 unmarried youth aged 18 to 27 years. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to examine factors associated with unmarried youth's premarital sex, casual relationships, multiple sex partners, and premarital pregnancy. Results: Unmarried youth in Hong Kong had adequate sex knowledge, but contraceptive knowledge was deficient. The majority of unmarried youth (63.8%) held liberal attitudes toward premarital sex and about half held liberal attitudes toward any form of sexual activity and premarital pregnancy. Around 60% held conservative attitudes toward causal sex relationships and multiple sex partners. Males tended to hold more liberal attitudes toward high-risk sex behaviors than female youth. Approximately 41.5% of unmarried youth reported having engaged in premarital sex, whereas less than 10% engaged in high-risk sexual behaviors. Males also reported higher amounts of premarital sex, casual sex relationships, and multiple sex partners. Females reported higher levels of sexual coercion. Logistic regressions indicated that being older, coming from a divorced family, out of school status and liberal attitudes toward risky sex behavior were more likely to engage in premarital sex or high-risk sex behaviors, and being female, being better educated and being immigrants were less likely to engage in premarital sex. However, being immigrants was more likely to engage in casual relationship and to have multiple partners. Conclusions: Premarital sex is becoming more prevalent among unmarried youth in Hong Kong, and a small proportion of young adults are engaging in high-risk sexual behaviors. Sex education and HIV prevention programs should equip them with adequate knowledge on contraception and condom use. Intervention programs can start with their attitudes toward sex. © 2013 Yip et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84883399994	A semiparametric cure model for interval-censored data	There is a growing interest in the analysis of survival data with a cured proportion particularly in tumor recurrences studies. Biologically, it is reasonable to assume that the recurrence time is mainly affected by the overall health condition of the patient that depends on some covariates such as age, sex, or treatment type received. We propose a semiparametric frailty-Cox cure model to quantify the overall health condition of the patient by a covariate-dependent frailty that has a discrete mass at zero to characterize the cured patients, and a positive continuous part to characterize the heterogeneous health conditions among the uncured patients. A multiple imputation estimation method is proposed for the right-censored case, which is further extended to accommodate interval-censored data. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed method is highly satisfactory. For illustration, the model is fitted to a set of right-censored melanoma incidence data and a set of interval-censored breast cosmesis data. Our analysis suggests that patients receiving treatment of radiotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy have a significantly higher probability of breast retraction, but also a lower hazard rate of breast retraction among those patients who will eventually experience the event with similar health conditions. The interpretation is very different to those based on models without a cure component that the treatment of radiotherapy with adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increases the risk of breast retraction. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84886723915	Prevalence of and associations with reduced exercise capacity in peritoneal dialysis patients	Background: Exercise capacity is reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance home peritoneal dialysis therapy, although the potential mechanisms and clinical implications remain unclear. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting & Participants: 95 ambulatory prevalent and incident peritoneal dialysis patients in a well-established renal dialysis center (mean age, 58.26 ± 12.6 [SD] years; 63% men; mean duration of peritoneal dialysis therapy, 3.2 ± 4.1 years). Predictor: Estimated volume status using spectral bioelectrical impedance, echocardiography-derived hemodynamic parameters. Outcome: Exercise capacity measured as peak oxygen consumption using symptom-limiting treadmill exercise testing. Results: Exercise capacity was reduced in 96% of patients and severely reduced in 65%. Extracellular to intracellular fluid volume ratio showed the strongest correlation with reduced exercise capacity (R = -0.63; P < 0.001) and was superior to age, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (E:E′ ratio), lean tissue mass index, and hemoglobin and albumin levels in predicting exercise intolerance. Limitations: Relatively small sample size and echocardiogram that was performed only at rest. Conclusions: There was a strong relationship between body extracellular to intracellular fluid volume ratio and exercise capacity in peritoneal dialysis patients. These findings provide new evidence for a connection between fluid distribution, muscle mass, and exercise capacity. Therapeutic strategies targeting fluid status and muscle mass may improve the exercise capacity of patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy. © 2013 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

0141427804	Prevalence, clinical spectrum and health care utilization of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in a Chinese population: A population-based study	Background: Population-based data on gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in Chinese are lacking. The prevalence, clinical spectrum and health care-seeking behaviour of subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were studied. Methods: Ethnic Chinese (3605) were invited to participate in a telephone survey using a validated gastro-oesophageal reflux disease questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: A total of 2209 subjects (58% female; mean age, 40.3 years) completed the interview. The annual, monthly and weekly prevalence rates of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were 29.8%, 8.9% and 2.5%, respectively. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms were associated with non-cardiac chest pain [odds ratio (OR), 2.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.7-3.1], dyspepsia (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4-2.5), globus (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7), acid feeling in the stomach (OR, 5.8; 95% CI, 4.5-7.5) and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5-3.6), but not with dysphagia, bronchitis, asthma, hoarseness and pneumonia. Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease had a significantly higher anxiety and depression score and required more days off work when compared with subjects without. The frequency of heartburn (P = 0.032), female gender (P < 0.001), degree of depression (P = 0.004) and social morbidity (P < 0.001) were independent factors associated with health care-seeking behaviour. Conclusion: The prevalence of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease was lower than that in Western populations, but carried a significant socio-economic burden in the studied Chinese population. The frequency of heart-burn, female gender and psychosocial factors were associated with health care utilization in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.

Ignorance of ties - that is, zero differences - in the sign test can substantially inflate the Type I error rate. A uniformly most powerful test has been developed to test for the symmetry of the positive and negative differences but little attention has been given about inferences concerning the median difference when ties are abundant. This article examines a simple modified sign test which can be implemented in most computer packages and a likelihood ratio test.

84894254658	Comparison of the knowledge, attitudes and practice with antibiotic use between traditional chinese medicine and western medicine usual attenders in hong kong	Background: Patients who usually attend Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) need to go to western medicine (WM) doctors for antibiotics in Hong Kong. They might have different knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with antibiotics from the WM-attenders. Objective: This study compares TCM attenders with the WM-attenders in Hong Kong about their KAP with antibiotics. The comparison could help future campaigns/education on appropriate antibiotic use. Design and setting: A questionnaire on KAP with antibiotics was designed after eight focus groups of purposively selected participants. A territory-wide telephone survey then interviewed randomly selected residents who were aged 18 years or above and spoke the local dialect. Result: Of 2471 respondents, 270 and 2092 usually attended TCM and WM, respectively. Majority of both the TCM- and WM-attenders preferred doctors who were judicious in prescribing antibiotics and seldom asked for them. The TCM-attenders were significantly more likely to be female and with lower household income. They were also more likely to agree that antibiotics were not useful for upper respiratory tract infections and that antibiotic resistance was a serious local problem. They were less likely to accept or be treated with antibiotics. The TCM-attenders were also more concerned about the side-effects of antibiotics. However, they were also less likely than the WM-attenders to always finish a full course of antibiotic. Conclusion: Apart from non-compliance, the TCM-attenders' KAP with antibiotics favour the appropriate use of antibiotics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84899952736	Estimation of intervention effects using recurrent event time data in the presence of event dependence and a cured fraction	Recurrent event data with a fraction of subjects having zero event are often seen in randomized clinical trials. Those with zero event may belong to a cured (or non-susceptible) fraction. Event dependence refers to the situation that a person's past event history affects his future event occurrences. In the presence of event dependence, an intervention may have an impact on the event rate in the non-cured through two pathways-a primary effect directly on the outcome event and a secondary effect mediated through event dependence. The primary effect combined with the secondary effect is the total effect. We propose a frailty mixture model and a two-step estimation procedure for the estimation of the effect of an intervention on the probability of cure and the total effect on event rate in the non-cured. A summary measure of intervention effects is derived. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by simulation. Data on respiratory exacerbations from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial are re-analyzed for illustration. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84902650511	Semiparametric analysis of clustered interval-censored survival data with a cure fraction	A generalization of the semiparametric Cox's proportional hazards model by means of a random effect or frailty approach to accommodate clustered survival data with a cure fraction is considered. The frailty serves as a quantification of the health condition of the subjects under study and may depend on some observed covariates like age. One single individual-specific frailty that acts on the hazard function is adopted to determine the cure status of an individual and the heterogeneity on the time to event if the individual is not cured. Under this formulation, an individual who has a high propensity to be cured would tend to have a longer time to event if he is not cured. Within a cluster, both the cure statuses and the times to event of the individuals would be correlated. In contrast to some models proposed in the literature, the model accommodates the correlations among the observations in a more natural way. A multiple imputation estimation method is proposed for both right-censored and interval-censored data. Simulation studies show that the performance of the proposed estimation method is highly satisfactory. The proposed model and method are applied to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's hypobaric decompression sickness data to investigate the factors associated with the occurrence and the time to onset of grade IV venous gas emboli under hypobaric environments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The purpose of this study was to describe the risk of ischemic stroke and ICH in a large contemporary "real world" cohort of Chinese AF patients in Hong Kong with detailed long-term follow-up. Methods This observational study used a hospital-based cohort of Chinese patients with nonvalvular AF. Results Among 9727 patients with nonvalvular AF (age 76.9 ± 12.5 years, 52.1% female), 3881 patients (39.9%) did not receive antithrombotic therapy, 3934 patients (40.4%) were taking aspirin, and 1912 (19.7%) were taking warfarin. After mean follow-up of 3.19 years, 847 patients (21.8%) without antithrombotic therapy developed ischemic strokes (annual risk 9.28%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 8.89%-9.70%).

84920522134	Health system reforms, violence against doctors and job satisfaction in the medical profession: A cross-sectional survey in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China	Objective: To explore the factors influencing doctors' job satisfaction and morale in China, in the context of the ongoing health system reforms and the deteriorating doctor-patient relationship. Design: Cross-sectional survey using self-completion questionnaires. Study setting: The survey was conducted from March to May 2012 among doctors at the provincial, county and primary care levels in Zhejiang Province, China. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 202 doctors. Factors which contributed most to low job satisfaction were low income and long working hours. Provincial level doctors were most dissatisfied while primary care doctors were the least dissatisfied. Three per cent of doctors at high-level hospitals and 27% of those in primary care were satisfied with the salary. Only 7% at high-level hospitals were satisfied with the work hours, compared to 43% in primary care. Less than 10% at high levels were satisfied with the amount of paid vacation time (3%) and paid sick leave (5%), compared with 38% and 41%, respectively, in primary care. Overall, 87% reported that patients were more likely to sue and that patient violence against doctors was increasing. Only 4.5% wanted their children to be doctors. Of those 125 who provided a reason, 34% said poor pay, 17% said it was a high-risk profession, and 9% expressed concerns about personal insecurity or patient violence. Conclusions: Doctors have low job satisfaction overall. Recruitment and retention of doctors have become major challenges for the Chinese health system. Measures must be taken to address this, in order to ensure recruitment and retention of doctors in the future. These measures must first include reduction of doctors' workload, especially at provincial hospitals, partly through incentivisation of appropriate utilisation of primary care, increase in doctors' salary and more effective measures to tackle patient violence against doctors.

10744232346	Double-blind, randomized controlled study to assess the effects of lansoprazole 30 mg and lansoprazole 15 mg on 24-h oesophageal and intragastric pH in Chinese subjects with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease	Background: Previous studies have suggested that the acid secretory capacity of the Chinese population is lower than that of the Western population. Aim: To compare the effect of lansoprazole 30 mg and 15 mg once daily on the 24-h oesophageal and intragastric pH profiles in Chinese patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Methods: Forty-four patients (male to female ratio, 27:17; mean age, 53 years; 55% with oesophagitis) with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were randomized to receive lansoprazole 30 mg or 15 mg once daily for 4 weeks. Measurement of the 24-h oesophageal and intragastric pH, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms and quality of life was performed at baseline and during the last week of each dosing period. Results: Lansoprazole 30 mg maintained an intragastric pH > 4 for 10.5 h vs. 9.6 h for lansoprazole 15 mg (P = 0.44). The percentage total time at oesophageal pH < 4 was similar for lansoprazole 30 mg and 15 mg (2.0% vs. 2.3%, P = 0.30). The proportion of patients with complete cure of heartburn and acid regurgitation and the quality of life assessment were similar for lansoprazole 30 mg and 15 mg. Both dosages of lansoprazole were well tolerated and the compliance was 100% in both groups. Conclusion: Lansoprazole dosages of 30 mg and 15 mg once daily provide a satisfactory decrease for oesophageal acid exposure and are equally effective for the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in the Chinese population.

12844256467	A comparison study of realtime fatality rates: Severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Toronto and Beijing, China	In an outbreak of a completely new infectious disease like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), estimation of the fatality rate over the course of the epidemic is of clinical and epidemiological importance. In contrast with the constant case fatality rate, a new measure, termed the 'realtime' fatality rate, is proposed for monitoring the new emerging epidemic at a population level. A competing risk model implemented via a counting process is used to estimate the realtime fatality rate in an epidemic of SARS. It can capture and reflect the time-varying nature of the fatality rate over the course of the outbreak in a timely and accurate manner. More importantly, it can provide information on the efficacy of a certain treatment and management policy for the disease. The method has been applied to the SARS data from the regions affected, namely Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, Taiwan and Beijing. The magnitudes and patterns of the estimated fatalities are virtually the same except in Beijing, which has a lower rate. It is speculated that the effect is linked to the different treatment protocols that were used. The standard estimate of the case fatality rate that was used by the World Health Organization has been shown to be unable to provide useful information to monitor the time-varying fatalities that are caused by the epidemic.

12144288624	Population based study of noncardiac chest pain in southern Chinese: Prevalence, psychosocial factors and health care utilization	Aim: Population-based assessment of noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, psychosocial factors and health seeking behaviour of NCCP in southern Chinese. Methods: A total of 2 209 ethnic Hong Kong Chinese households were recruited to participate in a telephone survey to study the epidemiology of NCCP using the Rose angina questionnaire, a validated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) questionnaire and the hospital anxiety-depression scale. NCCP was defined as non-exertional chest pain according to the Rose angina questionnaire and had not been diagnosed as ischaemic heart diseases by a physician. Results: Chest pain over the past year was present in 454 subjects (20.6%, 95% CI 19-22), while NCCP was present in 307 subjects (13.9%, 95% CI 13-15). GERD was present in 51% of subjects with NCCP and 34% had consulted a physician for chest pain. Subjects with NCCP had a significantly higher anxiety (P<0.001) and depression score (P=0.007), and required more days off (P=0.021) than subjects with no chest pain. By multiple logistic regression analysis, female gender (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), presence of GERD (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-4.8), and social life being affected by NCCP (OR 6.9, 95% CI 3.3-15.9) were independent factors associated with health seeking behaviour in southern Chinese with NCCP. Conclusion: NCCP is a common problem in southern Chinese and associated with anxiety and depression. Female gender, GERD and social life affected by chest pain were associated with health care utilization in subjects with NCCP. Copyright © 2004 by The WJG Press.
