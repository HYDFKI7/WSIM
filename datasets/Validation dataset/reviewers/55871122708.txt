2342506619	A neuron model-free controller with fuzzy tuning gain for continuous steel casting processes	The continuous steel casting is an important link in steel production. The performance of mold level control for the continuous steel casting affects the steel quality directly. The main difficulties for mold level control are that the continuous steel casting has big uncertainties and grave nonlinearities, and the continuous steel caster runs in its hot and hostile environment. In this paper, the neuron model-free control method with fuzzy tuning gain is proposed for continuous steel casting processes. In this control system, the neuron controller is used to control the mold level and the fuzzy algorithm to tune controller gain. According to the system operation conditions, the fuzzy rule base is updated to improve control performance. The experiments are made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

34248176164	P systems based multi-objective optimization algorithm	Based on P systems, this paper proposes a new multi-objective optimization algorithm (PMOA). Similar to P systems, PMOA has a cell-like structure. The structure is dynamic and its membranes merge and divide at different stages. The key rule of a membrane is the communication rule which is derived from P systems. Mutation rules are important for the algorithm, which has different ranges of mutation in different membranes. The cooperation of the two rules contributes to the diversity of the population, the conquest of the multimodality of objective function and the convergence of algorithm. Moreover, the unique structure divides the whole population into several subpopulations, which decreases the computational complexity. Almost a dozen popular algorithms are compared using several test problems. Simulation results illustrate that the PMOA has the best performance. Its solutions are closer to the true Pareto-optimal front and distributed well. Moreover, it converges fast.

The GA chromosome consists of integer string, which has shorter length than binary string. Using the proposed repairing mechanism, new chromosomes produced in evolution process are repaired to comply with all constraints. As the alternative to penalty function method, the repairing mechanism turns solutions to feasible ones, and avoid coping with economic load dispatch(ELD) sub-problem for infeasible solutions. The algorithm is tested and validated in 6 cases with different scale up to 100 units. The solutions obtained by r-ICGA have lower operating costs, and the algorithm has approximate linear execution time versus unit number. These simulation results indicate that r-ICGA is more appropriate to large scale unit-commitment problem. © All Rights Reserved.

84876698863	Hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm for parameter estimation of proton exchange membrane fuel cell	The accurate electrochemical model plays an important role in design and analysis of hydrogen fuel cell systems. For the purpose of estimating parameters of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) model, and inspired by the foraging behavior of bacteria and bees, a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is proposed. The HABC uses an improved solution search equation that mimics the chemotactic effect of bacteria to enhance the local search ability. To avoid premature convergence and improve search accuracy, the adaptive Boltzmann selection scheme is adopted, which adjusts selective probabilities in different stages. Performance testing has been conducted on some typical benchmark functions. The results demonstrate that the HABC outperforms other methods (BIPOA, PSOPS and two improved GAs) in both convergence speed and accuracy. The proposed approach is applied to estimate the PEMFC model parameters and the satisfactory model predictive curves are obtained. More experimental results in different search ranges and validate strategies indicate that HABC is an efficient technique for the parameter estimation problem of PEMFC.

The netted membrane structure of HBS is based on the distributed parallel computational mode of membrane computing (MC) and inspired by the shape, structure, and function of the Golgi apparatus of eukaryotic cells. The different localized subalgorithms in the proposed hybrid method are translated from the different local rules used in different membranes. When this hybrid method is applied to solve optimization problems, these subalgorithms operate in an orderly fashion on the objects containing a tentative solution in accordance with their probabilities; simultaneously, the communication object comprising best objects is transferred between different membranes according to the communication rule. The search capacity of the proposed method is ensured by both the global search subalgorithm of the improved BIAMC and the local search subalgorithm of SQP.

The proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a complex nonlinear, multi-variable system. The mathematical modeling of PEM fuel cell usually leads to nonlinear parameter estimation problems which often contain more than one minimum. In this paper, a novel bio-inspired P systems based optimization algorithm, named BIPOA, is proposed to solve PEM fuel cell model parameter estimation problems. In BIPOA, the nested membrane structure and new rules such as adaptive mutation rule, partial migration rule and autophagy rule are combined to improve the algorithm's global search capacities and convergence accuracy. Studies on some benchmark test functions indicate that the BIPOA outperforms the other two methods (PSOPS and GAs) in both convergence speed and accuracy. In addition, experimental results reveal that the model predictive outputs are in better agreement with the actual experimental data. Therefore, the BIPOA is a helpful and reliable technique for estimating the PEM fuel cell model parameters and is available to other complex parameter estimation problems of fuel cell models. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

However, how to tackle large-scale ZWSPs with setup times is still a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel hybrid permutation-based differential evolution (HPDE) for this purpose. More specifically, ZWSPs are formulated as asymmetrical traveling salesman problems (ATSP). To deal with ATSP model effectively, a permutation-based DE (PDE) algorithm and fast complex heuristic (FCH) local search scheme are proposed. Furthermore, HPDE, a hybrid approach of PDE and FCH local search, is proposed. The performances of HPDE are illustrated based on extensive experiments and comparisons with recently developed approaches in literature. The results demonstrate that HPDE reaches high-quality solutions in short computational time. Furthermore, it requires fewer user-defined parameters, rendering it applicable to real-life large-scale ZWSPs with setup times. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, relearning strategy is adopted in asynchronous particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to enhance its convergence. Although asynchronous PSO converges faster than synchronous PSO in most cases, it cannot guarantee a high successful rate of reproduction of better offspring in each generation. When a particle cannot search a better personal best position, the relearning strategy is utilized to enforce the particle learn again according to the original PSO formula. Moreover, a new mutation operator called Gaussian hypermutation is proposed to maintain the population diversity. Simulation results based on nine benchmark functions show that relearning strategy significantly improves the performance of asynchronous PSO. © 2011 IEEE.

84876081916	BMP9-regulated angiogenic signaling plays an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors that can be isolated from numerous tissues. MSCs can undergo osteogenic differentiation under proper stimuli.Wehave recently demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is one of the most osteogenic BMPs. As one of the least studied BMPs, BMP9 has been shown to regulate angiogenesis in endothelial cells. However, it is unclear whether BMP9-regulated angiogenic signaling plays any important role in the BMP9-initiated osteogenic pathway in MSCs. Here, we investigate the functional role of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)-mediated angiogenic signaling in BMP9-regulated osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. We find that BMP9 induces HIF1α expression in MSCs through Smad1/5/8 signaling. Exogenous expression of HIF1α potentiates BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. siRNA-mediated silencing of HIF1α or HIF1α inhibitor CAY10585 profoundly blunts BMP9-induced osteogenic signaling inMSCs. HIF1α expressionregulated by cobalt-induced hypoxia also recapitulates the synergistic effect between HIF1α and BMP9 in osteogenic differentiation. Mechanistically, HIF1α is shown to exert its synergisticeffect with BMP9 by inducing both angiogenic signaling and osteogenic signaling in MSCs. Thus,our findings should not only expand our understanding of the molecular basis behind BMP9-regulated osteoblastic lineage-specific differentiation, but also provide an opportunity to harnessthe BMP9-induced synergy between osteogenic and angiogenic signaling pathways in regenerative medicine. © 2013.

84878348235	Wnt signaling in bone formation and its therapeutic potential for bone diseases	The Wnt signaling pathway plays an important role not only in embryonic development but also in the maintenance and differentiation of the stem cells in adulthood. In particular, Wnt signaling has been shown as an important regulatory pathway in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Induction of the Wnt signaling pathway promotes bone formation while inactivation of the pathway leads to osteopenic states. Our current understanding of Wnt signaling in osteogenesis elucidates the molecular mechanisms of classic osteogenic pathologies. Activating and inactivating aberrations of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis results in sclerosteosis and osteoporosis respectively. Recent studies have sought to target the Wnt signaling pathway to treat osteogenic disorders. Potential therapeutic approaches attempt to stimulate the Wnt signaling pathway by upregulating the intracellular mediators of the Wnt signaling cascade and inhibiting the endogenous antagonists of the pathway. Antibodies against endogenous antagonists, such as sclerostin and dickkopf-1, have demonstrated promising results in promoting bone formation and fracture healing. Lithium, an inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3β, has also been reported to stimulate osteogenesis by stabilizing β catenin. Although manipulating the Wnt signaling pathway has abundant therapeutic potential, it requires cautious approach due to risks of tumorigenesis. The present review discusses the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis and examines its targeted therapeutic potential. © The Author(s) 2012.

84878907199	Particle swarm optimization with age-group topology for multimodal functions and data clustering	This paper proposes particle swarm optimization with age-group topology (PSOAG), a novel age-based particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this work, we present a new concept of age to measure the search ability of each particle in local area. To keep population diversity during searching, we separate particles to different age-groups by their age and particles in each age-group can only select the ones in younger groups or their own groups as their neighbourhoods. To allow search escape from local optima, the aging particles are regularly replaced by new and randomly generated ones. In addition, we design an age-group based parameter setting method, where particles in different age-groups have different parameters, to accelerate convergence. This algorithm is applied to nonlinear function optimization and data clustering problems for performance evaluation. In comparison against several PSO variants and other EAs, we find that the proposed algorithm provides significantly better performances on both the function optimization problems and the data clustering tasks. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879667812	Particle Swarm Optimizer with Aging Operator for Multimodal Function Optimization	This paper proposes a new scheme for preventing a Particle Swarm Optimizer from premature convergence on multimodal optimization problems. Instead of only using fitness evaluation, we use a new index called particle age to guide population towards more promising region of the search space. The particle age is a measure of how long each particle moves towards a better solution. The main novelty of the proposed method is to let each particle learn from not only neighbours with better fitness values but also the neighbours whose fitness values are updated more frequently. To achieve this, we design a comprehensive age-based learning strategy, in which age is used for excluding old particles, selecting learning exemplars and deciding mutation strength and inertial weight for each particle. Experiments were conducted on 15 multimodal test functions to assess the performance of this new strategy in comparison with 7 state-of-the-art PSOs from the literature. The experimental results show the good performance of the proposed algorithm in solving multimodal functions when compared with several existing PSO variants. © 2013 Copyright the authors.

84883409771	Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress Inducible Factor Cysteine-Rich with EGF-Like Domains 2 (Creld2) Is an Important Mediator of BMP9-Regulated Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors that can undergo osteogenic differentiation under proper stimuli. We demonstrated that BMP9 is one of the most osteogenic BMPs. However, the molecular mechanism underlying BMP9-initiated osteogenic signaling in MSCs remains unclear. Through gene expression profiling analysis we identified several candidate mediators of BMP9 osteogenic signaling. Here, we focus on one such signaling mediator and investigate the functional role of cysteine-rich with EGF-like domains 2 (Creld2) in BMP9-initiated osteogenic signaling. Creld2 was originally identified as an ER stress-inducible factor localized in the ER-Golgi apparatus. Our genomewide expression profiling analysis indicates that Creld2 is among the top up-regulated genes in BMP9-stimulated MSCs. We confirm that Creld2 is up-regulated by BMP9 in MSCs. ChIP analysis indicates that Smad1/5/8 directly binds to the Creld2 promoter in a BMP9-dependent fashion. Exogenous expression of Creld2 in MSCs potentiates BMP9-induced early and late osteogenic markers, and matrix mineralization. Conversely, silencing Creld2 expression inhibits BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. In vivo stem cell implantation assay reveals that exogenous Creld2 promotes BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation and matrix mineralization, whereas silencing Creld2 expression diminishes BMP9-induced bone formation and matrix mineralization. We further show that Creld2 is localized in ER and the ER stress inducers potentiate BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. Our results strongly suggest that Creld2 may be directly regulated by BMP9 and ER stress response may play an important role in regulating osteogenic differentiation. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84884763205	Cross-talk between EGF and BMP9 signalling pathways regulates the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors, which give rise to several lineages, including bone, cartilage and fat. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates cell growth, proliferation and differentiation. EGF acts by binding with high affinity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface and stimulating the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity of its receptor, which initiates a signal transduction cascade causing a variety of biochemical changes within the cell and regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. We have identified BMP9 as one of the most osteogenic BMPs in MSCs. In this study, we investigate if EGF signalling cross-talks with BMP9 and regulates BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation. We find that EGF potentiates BMP9-induced early and late osteogenic markers of MSCs in vitro, which can be effectively blunted by EGFR inhibitors Gefitinib and Erlotinib or receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG-1478 and AG-494 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, EGF significantly augments BMP9-induced bone formation in the cultured mouse foetal limb explants. In vivo stem cell implantation experiment reveals that exogenous expression of EGF in MSCs can effectively potentiate BMP9-induced ectopic bone formation, yielding larger and more mature bone masses. Interestingly, we find that, while EGF can induce BMP9 expression in MSCs, EGFR expression is directly up-regulated by BMP9 through Smad1/5/8 signalling pathway. Thus, the cross-talk between EGF and BMP9 signalling pathways in MSCs may underline their important roles in regulating osteogenic differentiation. Harnessing the synergy between BMP9 and EGF should be beneficial for enhancing osteogenesis in regenerative medicine. © 2013 The Authors.

It is known that epigenetic regulations play an important role in regulating the stem cell potency and lineage commitment. Here, we investigate if the inhibition of histone deacetylases (Hdacs) affects BMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Methods: Using the Hdac inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), we assess that TSA enhances BMP9-mediated osteogenic markers and matrix mineralization in MSCs, and bone formation in mouse embryonic limb explants. Results: We find that the endogenous expression of most of the 11 Hdacs is readily detectable in MSCs. BMP9 is shown to induce most Hdacs in MSCs. We demonstrate that TSA potentiates BMP9-induced early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in MSCs, as well as late osteogenic markers osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) and matrix mineralization. Fetal limb explant culture studies reveal that TSA potentiates BMP9-induced endochondral bone formation, possibly by expanding hypertrophic chondrocyte zone of growth plate. Conclusion: Our findings strongly suggest histone deacetylases may play an important role in fine-tuning BMP9-mediated osteogenic signaling through a negative feedback network in MSCs. Thus, Hdac inhibitors may be used as novel therapeutics for bone fracture healing. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

0242469241	Model-free PID controller with gain scheduling for turning processes	The model-free PID control method with fuzzy neuron gain scheduling is proposed for turning processes in this paper. In order to enhance the control system stability and adaptability to the plants with nonlinearities and uncertainties, the model-free PID controller is designed to keep the cutting force to be constant by changing the controller gain on-line when a cutting tool cuts at various cutting depth or the spindle operates in different speeds. In this control system, the PID controller is used to control the turning process, the neuron is applied to tune the PID controller gain, and a fuzzy scheme is set up to change the neuron gain. With the two examples of different turning processes, the experiments of using the proposed control method are made. The simulation results show the good performance of the model-free PID controller.

84888174535	The E-F hand calcium-binding protein s100a4 regulates the proliferation, survival and differentiation potential of human osteosarcoma cells	Background/Aims: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy in children and young adults. Molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of OS remain to be fully understood. Several members of the E-F hand calcium-binding S100 protein family are differentially expressed in human cancers. We previously showed that S100A6 is highly expressed in OS tumors. In this study, we investigated the role of S100A4 in regulating OS proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Methods/Results: Endogenous S100 expression was examined by semi-quantitative PCR in human OS lines. Adenoviral vector-mediated overexpression and RNAi knockdown of S100A4 were used to assess S100A4's effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion and osteogenic differentiation. Apoptosis was assessed by using anti-caspase-3 immunostaining and flow cytometry with annexin V staining. Early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and late markers osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN) were assessed to determine the status of osteogenic differentiation. We found that S100A4 was elevated in metastatic MG63.2 cells. S100A4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, prolonged cell doubling time, and induced significant apoptosis. Silencing S100A4 expression in OS cells delayed cell wounding closure and diminished the numbers of migrated OS cells in transwell invasion assay. Furthermore, silencing S100A4 expression stimulated ALP activity, as well as late markers OPN and OCN, in both OS cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that S100A4 may promote OS tumor growth by regulating the cell cycle, reducing apoptosis, and inhibiting osteogenic differentiation. Thus, S100A4 may serve as a marker for tumorigenic potential, as well as a therapeutic target. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84889604059	Modulation of β-catenin signaling by the inhibitors of MAP kinase, tyrosine kinase, and PI3-kinase pathways	Aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling plays an important role in human tumorigenesis. However, molecular mechanisms behind the β-catenin signaling deregulation are mostly unknown because genetic alterations in this pathway only account for a small fraction of tumors. Here, we investigator if other major pathways can regulate β-catenin signaling activity. By employing a panel of chemical activators and/or inhibitors of several cellular signaling pathways, we assess these modulators' effects on luciferase reporter driven by β-catenin/TCF4-responsive elements. We find that lithium-stimulated β-catenin activity is synergistically enhanced by protein kinase C activator PMA. However, β-catenin-regulated transcriptional (CRT) activity is significantly inhibited by casein kinase II inhibitor DRB, MEK inhibitor PD98059, G-proteins and their receptor uncoupling agent suramin, protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, and PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, suggesting that these cellular pathways may participate in regulating β-catenin signaling.

84890425623	Parameter identification for solid oxide fuel cells using cooperative barebone particle swarm optimization with hybrid learning	Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) has been widely recognized as one of the most promising fuel cells. The SOFC performance is highly influenced by several parameters associated with the internal multi-physicochemical processes. In this work, the optimal modeling strategy is designed to determine the parameters of SOFC using a simple and efficient barebone particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm. The cooperative coevolution strategy is applied to divide the output voltage function into four subfunctions based on the interdependence among variables. To the nonlinear characteristic of SOFC model, a hybrid learning strategy is proposed for BPSO to ensure a good balance between exploration and exploitation. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The comparisons also indicate that cooperative coevolution strategy and hybrid learning improve the performance of original PSO algorithm, offering better approximation effect and stronger robustness.

In acRNA-GA, each individual is represented by nucleotide bases. The crossover operators including competitive permutation operator, translocation operators and inversion operator based on RNA molecular operations are designed to improve the diversity of the population and overcome the premature convergence of GA. An adaptive crossover probability in term of the fitness value is employed to further enhance the global searching ability and the convergence speed. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by four typical benchmark functions. Finally, acRNA-GA is implemented on parameter estimation of the heavy oil thermal cracking three-lumped model.

The recurrent least square method is utilized to obtain the weights of sequent part in the RFNN. Thus, the dynamic RFNN model is obtained with high precision to pH neutralization process.

84890666920	Destabilization of heterologous proteins mediated by the GSK3β phosphorylation domain of the β-catenin protein	Background and Aims: Wnt/β-catenin signaling plays important roles in development and cellular processes. The hallmark of canonical Wnt signaling activation is the stabilization of β-catenin protein in cytoplasm and/or nucleus. The stability of β-catenin is the key to its biological functions and is controlled by the phosphorylation of its amino-terminal degradation domain. Aberrant activation of β-catenin signaling has been implicated in the development of human cancers. It has been recently suggested that GSK3βmay play an essential role in regulating global protein turnover. Here, we investigate if the GSK3β phosphorylation site-containing degradation domain of β-catenin is sufficient to destabilize heterologous proteins. Methods and Results: We engineer chimeric proteins by fusing β-catenin degradation domain at the N- and/or C-termini of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). In both transient and stable expression experiments, the chimeric GFP proteins exhibit a significantly decreased stability, which can be effectively antagonized by lithium and Wnt1. An activating mutation in the destruction domain significantly stabilizes the fusion protein. Furthermore, GSK3 inhibitor SB-216763 effectively increases the GFP signal of the fusion protein. Conversely, the inhibition of Wnt signaling with tankyrase inhibitor XAV939 results in a decrease in GFP signal of the fusion proteins, while these small molecules have no significant effects on the mutant destruction domain-GFP fusion protein. Conclusion: Our findings strongly suggest that the β-catenin degradation domain may be sufficient to destabilize heterologous proteins in Wnt signaling-dependent manner. It is conceivable that the chimeric GFP proteins may be used as a functional reporter to measure the dynamic status of β-catenin signaling, and to identify potential anticancer drugs that target β-catenin signaling. © 2013 S.

84891935212	Crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin and estrogen receptor signaling synergistically promotes osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells	Osteogenic differentiation from mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are initiated and regulated by a cascade of signaling events. Either Wnt/β-catenin or estrogen signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating skeletal development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis. Here, we investigate the potential crosstalk and synergy of these two signaling pathways in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MPCs. We find that the activation of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling by estradiol (E2) or exogenously expressed ERα in MPCs synergistically enhances Wnt3A-induced early and late osteogenic markers, as well as matrix mineralization. The E2 or ERα-mediated synergy can be effectively blocked by ERα antagonist tamoxifen. E2 stimulation can enhance endochondral ossification of Wnt3A-transduced mouse fetal limb explants. Furthermore, exogenously expressed ERα significantly enhances the maturity and mineralization of Wnt3A-induced subcutaneous and intramuscular ectopic bone formation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that E2 does not exert any detectable effect on β- catenin/Tcf reporter activity. However, ERα expression is up-regulated within the first 48h in AdWnt3A-transduced MPCs, whereas ERβ expression is significantly inhibited within 24h. Moreover, the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of estrogens aromatase is modulated by Wnt3A in a biphasic manner, up-regulated at 24h but reduced after 48h. Our results demonstrate that, while ER signaling acts synergistically with Wnt3A in promoting osteogenic differentiation, Wnt3A may crosstalk with ER signaling by up-regulating ERα expression and down-regulating ERβ expression in MPCs. Thus, the signaling crosstalk and synergy between these two pathways should be further explored as a potential therapeutic approach to combating bone and skeletal disorders, such as fracture healing and osteoporosis. © 2013 Gao et al.

84897385071	Reduced-complexity constellation mapping and decoding in wireless multi-way relaying networks	In this paper, we focus on the multi-way relaying channel where K users wish to exchange information with each other within two phases. Precoding at each user and the relay is carefully constructed to ensure that the signals from the same user pair are grouped together and cross-pair interference can be cancelled. Reliable detection is challenging at the relay since the observation constellation is no longer one of the regular ones, due to the fact that a relay observation is the superposition of the messages from one of the 1/2 K(K - 1) user pairs. When the trellis coded modulation is used at each node, a simple constellation mapping function and a reduced-states decoding scheme can be applied at the relay, which result in much lower complexity. Furthermore, a modified version of the decoding method is also developed which is called the re-encoding-avoidance scheme at the relay. Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme. Copyright © 2014 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.

84898849001	Adenovirus-mediated efficient gene transfer into cultured three-dimensional organoids	Three-dimensional organoids have been recently established from various tissue-specific progenitors (such as intestinal stem cells), induced pluripotent stem cells, or embryonic stem cells. These cultured self-sustaining stem cell-based organoids may become valuable systems to study the roles of tissue-specific stem cells in tissue genesis and disease development. It is thus conceivable that effective genetic manipulations in such organoids may allow us to reconstruct disease processes and/or develop novel therapeutics. Recombinant adenoviruses are one of the most commonly used viral vectors for in vitro and in vivo gene deliveries. In this study, we investigate if adenoviruses can be used to effectively deliver transgenes into the cultured ''mini-gut'' organoids derived from intestinal stem cells. Using adenoviral vectors that express fluorescent proteins, we demonstrate that adenoviruses can effectively deliver transgenes into the cultured 3-D "mini-gut" organoids. The transgene expression can last at least 10 days in the cultured organoids. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated noggin expression effectively support the survival and self-renewal of mini-gut organoids, while adenovirus-mediated expression of BMP4 inhibits the self-sustainability and proliferation of the organoids. Thus, our results strongly suggest that adenovirus vectors can be explored as effective gene delivery vehicles to introduce genetic manipulations in 3-D organoids. © 2014 Wang et al.

84899128722	Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in mesenchymal stem cells can be significantly enhanced by the cationic polymer polybrene	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitors, which can undergo self-renewal and give rise to multi-lineages. A great deal of attentions have been paid to their potential use in regenerative medicine as potential therapeutic genes can be introduced into MSCs. Genetic manipulations in MSCs requires effective gene deliveries. Recombinant adenoviruses are widely used gene transfer vectors. We have found that although MSCs can be infected in vitro by adenoviruses, high virus titers are needed to achieve high efficiency. Here, we investigate if the commonly-used cationic polymer Polybrene can potentiate adenovirus-mediated transgene delivery into MSCs, such as C2C12 cells and iMEFs. Using the AdRFP adenovirus, we find that AdRFP transduction efficiency is significantly increased by Polybrene in a dose-dependent fashion peaking at 8 mg/ml in C2C12 and iMEFs cells. Quantitative luciferase assay reveals that Polybrene significantly enhances AdFLuc-mediated luciferase activity in C2C12 and iMEFs at as low as 4 μg/ml and 2 μg/ml, respectively. FACS analysis indicates that Polybrene (at 4 μg/ml) increases the percentage of RFP-positive cells by approximately 430 folds in AdRFP-transduced iMEFs, suggesting Polybrene may increase adenovirus infection efficiency. Furthermore, Polybrene can enhance AdBMP9-induced osteogenic differentiation of MSCs as early osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase activity can be increased more than 73 folds by Polybrene (4 μg/ml) in AdBMP9-transduced iMEFs. No cytotoxicity was observed in C2C12 and iMEFs at Polybrene up to 40 μg/ml, which is about 10-fold higher than the effective concentration required to enhance adenovirus transduction in MSCs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Polybrene should be routinely used as a safe, effective and inexpensive augmenting agent for adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in MSCs, as well as other types of mammalian cells. © 2014 Zhao et al.

84899560540	Characterization of constitutive promoters for piggyBac transposon-mediated stable transgene expression in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)	Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can undergo self-renewal and give rise to multi-lineages under given differentiation cues. It is frequently desirable to achieve a stable and high level of transgene expression in MSCs in order to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms through which MSC self-renewal and lineage commitment are regulated. Retroviral or lentiviral vector-mediated gene expression in MSCs usually decreases over time. Here, we choose to use the piggyBac transposon system and conduct a systematic comparison of six commonly-used constitutive promoters for their abilities to drive RFP or firefly luciferase expression in somatic HEK-293 cells and MSC iMEF cells. The analyzed promoters include three viral promoters (CMV, CMV-IVS, and SV40), one housekeeping gene promoter (UbC), and two composite promoters of viral and housekeeping gene promoters (hEFH and CAG-hEFH). CMV-derived promoters are shown to drive the highest transgene expression in HEK-293 cells, which is however significantly reduced in MSCs. Conversely, the composite promoter hEFH exhibits the highest transgene expression in MSCs whereas its promoter activity is modest in HEK-293 cells. The reduced transgene expression driven by CMV promoters in MSCs may be at least in part caused by DNA methylation, or to a lesser extent histone deacetlyation. However, the hEFH promoter is not significantly affected by these epigenetic modifications. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the hEFH composite promoter may be an ideal promoter to drive long-term and high level transgene expression using the piggyBac transposon vector in progenitor cells such as MSCs. © 2014 Wen et al.

84901339177	The piggyBac transposon-mediated expression of SV40 T antigen efficiently immortalizes Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)	Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like multipotent progenitor cells and can undergo self-renewal and differentiate into to multiple lineages, including bone, cartilage and adipose. Primary MEFs have limited life span in culture, which thus hampers MEFs' basic research and translational applications. To overcome this challenge, we investigate if piggyBac transposon-mediated expression of SV40 T antigen can effectively immortalize mouse MEFs and that the immortalized MEFs can maintain long-term cell proliferation without compromising their multipotency. Using the piggyBac vector MPH86 which expresses SV40 T antigen flanked with flippase (FLP) recognition target (FRT) sites, we demonstrate that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can be efficiently immortalized. The immortalized MEFs (piMEFs) exhibit an enhanced proliferative activity and maintain long-term cell proliferation, which can be reversed by FLP recombinase. The piMEFs express most MEF markers and retain multipotency as they can differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages upon BMP9 stimulation in vitro. Stem cell implantation studies indicate that piMEFs can form bone, cartilage and adipose tissues upon BMP9 stimulation, whereas FLP-mediated removal of SV40 T antigen diminishes the ability of piMEFs to differentiate into these lineages, possibly due to the reduced expansion of progenitor populations. Our results demonstrate that piggyBac transposon-mediated expression of SV40 T can effectively immortalize MEFs and that the reversibly immortalized piMEFs not only maintain long-term cell proliferation but also retain their multipotency. Thus, the high transposition efficiency and the potential footprint-free natures may render piggyBac transposition an effective and safe strategy to immortalize progenitor cells isolated from limited tissue supplies, which is essential for basic and translational studies. © 2014 Wang et al.

84901041743	Cooperative bare-bone particle swarm optimization for data clustering	Cooperative coevolution (CC) was used to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on complex optimization problems in a divide-and-conquer way. In this paper, we show that the CC framework can be very helpful to improve the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO) on clustering high-dimensional datasets. Based on CC framework, the original partitional clustering problem is first decomposed to several subproblems, each of which is then evolved by an optimizer independently. We employ a very simple but efficient optimization algorithm, namely bare-bone particle swarm optimization (BPSO), as the optimizer to solve each subproblem cooperatively. In addition, we design a new centroid-based encoding schema for each particle and apply the Chernoff bounds to decide a proper population size. The experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the BPSO and CC framework. The comparisons show the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms five EA-based clustering algorithms, i.e., PSO, SRPSO, ACO, ABC and DE, and K-means on most of the datasets. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The quad notched bands' center frequencies are modulated by changing the size of SRR-shaped slots and parasitic meandered ground stubs.

Besides, the proposed antenna has a compact size of 33mm*46mm, where these characteristics denote it is fit for mobile devices. © 2013 IEEE.

84902201674	Bone morphogenetic protein-9 effectively induces osteo/odontoblastic differentiation of the reversibly immortalized stem cells of dental apical papilla	Dental pulp/dentin regeneration using dental stem cells combined with odontogenic factors may offer great promise to treat and/or prevent premature tooth loss. We previously demonstrated that bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) is one of the most potent factors in inducing bone formation. Here, we investigate whether BMP9 can effectively induce odontogenic differentiation of the stem cells from mouse apical papilla (SCAPs). Using a reversible immortalization system expressing SV40 T flanked with Cre/loxP sites, we demonstrate that the SCAPs can be immortalized, resulting in immortalized SCAPs (iSCAPs) that express mesenchymal stem cell markers. BMP9 upregulates Runx2, Sox9, and PPARγ2 and odontoblastic markers, and induces alkaline phosphatase activity and matrix mineralization in the iSCAPs. Cre-mediated removal of SV40 T antigen decreases iSCAP proliferation. The in vivo stem cell implantation studies indicate that iSCAPs can differentiate into bone, cartilage, and, to lesser extent, adipocytes upon BMP9 stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the conditionally iSCAPs not only maintain long-term cell proliferation but also retain the ability to differentiate into multiple lineages, including osteo/odontoblastic differentiation. Thus, the reversibly iSCAPs may serve as an important tool to study SCAP biology and SCAP translational use in tooth engineering. Further, BMP9 may be explored as a novel and efficacious factor for odontogenic regeneration. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.

84903725662	Targeting BMP9-promoted human osteosarcoma growth by inactivation of notch signaling	Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignancy of bone and is usually associated with poor prognosis due to its high incidence of metastasis and chemoresistance. Molecular pathogenesis of OS is poorly understood. We previously showed that OS cells are refractory to BMP9-induced osteogenesis and respond favorably to proliferation and tumor growth. Here we investigate if Notch signaling mediates the BMP9-promoted cell proliferation and tumor growth of human osteosarcoma (OS). We find that the expression of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, DLL1, JAG1 and JAG2 is readily detected in most of the tested OS cell lines. BMP9-promoted OS cell proliferation, migration, and cell cycle S/G2 progression are effectively inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of Notch1 (dnNotch1) or the aγ-secretase inhibitor Compound E (ComE). Furthermore, BMP9-promoted tumor growth and osteolytic lesions in vivo are significantly inhibited by dnNotch1. BMP9 up-regulates the expression of Notch1, Notch3, DLL1, and JAG1 in OS cells. Accordingly, BMP9 stimulation induces a nuclear accumulation of NICD, which is blocked by ComE. Our results demonstrate that BMP9-promoted OS proliferation and tumor growth is at least in part mediated by Notch signaling, suggesting that osteogenic BMPs may function as upstream regulators of Notch signaling in OS tumorigenesis. Thus, pharmacologic intervention of Notch signaling may be explored as a new therapeutic strategy for human OS tumors. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.

Here, we investigate whether exogenous precursor terminal protein (pTP) expression in 293 cells improves the efficiency of adenovirus packaging and amplification. We used a piggyBac transposon-based vector and engineered a stable 293 line that expresses high level of Ad5 pTP, designated as 293pTP. Using the AdBMP6-GLuc that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP), BMP6 and Gaussia luciferase, we found that the infectivity of AdBMP6-GLuc viral samples packaged in 293pTP cells was titrated up to 19.3 times higher than that packaged in parental 293 cells. AdBMP6-GLuc viral samples packaged in 293pTP cells exhibited significantly higher transduction efficiency in 143B and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF) cells, as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of GFP-positive cells, the luciferase activity assay and BMP6-induced osteogenic marker alkaline phosphatase activities in iMEFs. When adenovirus amplification efficiency was analyzed, we found that 293pTP cells infected with AdBMP6-GLuc yielded up to 12.6 times higher titer than that in parental 293 cells, especially at lower multiplicities of infection. These results strongly suggest that exogenous pTP expression may accelerate the packaging and amplification of recombinant adenoviruses. Thus, the engineered 293pTP cells should be a superior packaging line for efficient adenovirus production. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84908331652	Composite differential evolution with modified oracle penalty method for constrained optimization problems	Motivated by recent advancements in differential evolution and constraints handling methods, this paper presents a novel modified oracle penalty function-based composite differential evolution (MOCoDE) for constrained optimization problems (COPs). More specifically, the original oracle penalty function approach is modified so as to satisfy the optimization criterion of COPs; then the modified oracle penalty function is incorporated in composite DE. Furthermore, in order to solve more complex COPs with discrete, integer, or binary variables, a discrete variable handling technique is introduced into MOCoDE to solve complex COPs with mix variables. This method is assessed on eleven constrained optimization benchmark functions and seven well-studied engineering problems in real life. Experimental results demonstrate that MOCoDE achieves competitive performance with respect to some other state-of-the-art approaches in constrained optimization evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, the strengths of the proposed method include few parameters and its ease of implementation, rendering it applicable to real life. Therefore, MOCoDE can be an efficient alternative to solving constrained optimization problems.

84911923093	Bone morphogenetic protein 2 inhibits the proliferation and growth of human colorectal cancer cells	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide. Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of CRC, which has led to successful early diagnosis, surgical intervention and combination chemotherapy. However, limited therapeutic options are available for metastatic and/or drug-resistant CRC. While the aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a critical initiating role in CRC development, disruption of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway causes juvenile polyposis syndrome, suggesting that BMP signaling may play a role in CRC development. However, conflicting results have been reported concerning the possible roles of BMP signaling in sporadic colon cancer. Here, we investigated the effect of BMP2 on the proliferation, migration, invasiveness and tumor growth capability of human CRC cells. Using an adenovirus vector that overexpresses BMP2 and the piggyBac transposon-mediated stable BMP2 overexpression CRC line, we found that exogenous BMP2 effectively inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation and colony formation. BMP2 was shown to suppress colon cancer cell migration and invasiveness. Under a low serum culture condition, forced expression of BMP2 induced a significantly increased level of apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Using a xenograft tumor model, we found that forced expression of BMP2 in HCT116 cells suppressed tumor growth, accompanied by decreased cell proliferation activity. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that BMP2 plays an important inhibitory role in governing the proliferation and aggressive features of human CRC cells.

Performance tests conducted on some typical benchmark functions have witnessed the validity of cRNA-GA. The cRNA-GA is also applied to estimate the parameters of the PEMFC model and the satisfactory results have shown its effectiveness.
