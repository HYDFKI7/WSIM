84877835247	A pseudo wavelet system-based vibration signature extracting method for rotating machinery fault detection	The rotating machinery, as a typical example of large and complex mechanical systems, is prone to diversified sorts of mechanical faults, especially on their rotating components. Although they can be collected via vibration measurements, the critical fault signatures are always masked by overwhelming interfering contents, therefore difficult to be identified. Moreover, owing to the distinguished time-frequency characteristics of the machinery fault signatures, classical dyadic wavelet transforms (DWTs) are not perfect for detecting them in noisy environments. In order to address the deficiencies of DWTs, a pseudo wavelet system (PWS) is proposed based on the filter constructing strategies of wavelet tight frames. The presented PWS is implemented via a specially devised shift-invariant filterbank structure, which generates non-dyadic wavelet subbands as well as dyadic ones. The PWS offers a finer partition of the vibration signal into the frequency-scale plane. In addition, in order to correctly identify the essential transient signatures produced by the faulty mechanical components, a new signal impulsiveness measure, named spatial spectral ensemble kurtosis (SSEK), is put forward. SSEK is used for selecting the optimal analyzing parameters among the decomposed wavelet subbands so that the masked critical fault signatures can be explicitly recognized. The proposed method has been applied to engineering fault diagnosis cases, in which the processing results showed its effectiveness and superiority to some existing methods. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Under the condition that only observed signals are known, the mixed signals can be separated into several components by denoising source separation (DSS) method according to statistical feature. The sources of observed signals are revealed by these independent components, thus it provides a direct reference to condition monitoring and active control of vibration and noise. The basic theory of DSS and denoising functions based on different criterion are studied, and the separation performance of four types of denoising function such as energy function, slope function, kurtosis function and tangent function are quantitatively compared by means of simulation of typical mechanical signals. The results show that the correlation coefficients between independent components, which are separated from nonlinear mixed signals by DSS based on tangent function, and related sources are more than 0.89.

84865646191	Fault feature extraction of gearbox by using overcomplete rational dilation discrete wavelet transform on signals measured from vibration sensors	Gearbox fault diagnosis is very important for preventing catastrophic accidents. Vibration signals of gearboxes measured by sensors are useful and dependable as they carry key information related to the mechanical faults in gearboxes. Effective signal processing techniques are in necessary demands to extract the fault features contained in the collected gearbox vibration signals. Overcomplete rational dilation discrete wavelet transform (ORDWT) enjoys attractive properties such as better shift-invariance, adjustable timefrequency distributions and flexible wavelet atoms of tunable oscillation in comparison with classical dyadic wavelet transform (DWT). Due to these advantages, ORDWT is presented as a versatile tool that can be adapted to analysis of gearbox fault features of different types, especially in analyzing the non-stationary and transient characteristics of the signals. Aiming to extract the various types of fault features confronted in gearbox fault diagnosis, a fault feature extraction technique based on ORDWT is proposed in this paper. In the routine of the proposed technique, ORDWT is used as the pre-processing decomposition tool, and a corresponding post-processing method is combined with ORDWT to extract the fault feature of a specific type. For extracting periodical impulses in the signal, an impulse matching algorithm is presented. In this algorithm, ORDWT bases of varied timefrequency distributions and varied oscillatory natures are adopted, moreover an improved signal impulsiveness measure derived from kurtosis is developed for choosing optimal ORDWT bases that perfectly match the hidden periodical impulses. For demodulation purpose, an improved instantaneous timefrequency spectrum (ITFS), based on the combination of ORDWT and Hilbert transform, is presented. For signal denoising applications, ORDWT is enhanced by neighboring coefficient shrinkage strategy as well as subband selection step to reveal the buried transient vibration contents. The proposed fault feature extraction technique is applied in a range of engineering applications, and the processing results demonstrate that the ORDWT-based feature extraction technique successfully identifies the incipient fault features in the cases where DWT and empirical mode decomposition method are less effective. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Aiming at solving the problem that reliability assessment methods based on probability statistical analysis are inappropriate to assess the reliability of the individual aero-engine, a novel method using the condition monitoring information is proposed. The condition subspace of the aero-engine is constructed by utilizing the Kernel principal component analysis(KPCA) to describe the performance change of the aero-engine. The principal angles between the subspaces from the normal state and the damage state are calculated. The principal angles are transformed into operating reliability index by a proper mapping function. The proposed method is validated by using both the aero-engine run-to-failure data shared by National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the practical test data from a repair factory of aero-plane. The results illustrate the proposed method can assess the operating reliability of the aero-plane reasonably. It also offers valid approach for the operating reliability assessment of the aero-plane whose failure model subjects to small sample characteristics. © 2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84881162548	Manifold subspace distance derived from kernel principal angles and its application to machinery structural damage assessment	Damage assessment of machinery structure is beneficial for identifying structural health states and preventing sudden failures. A novel scheme for damage assessment is presented by using manifold subspace distance in this study. Vibration response signals from the machinery structure are collected by accelerometers first, and feature matrices are extracted to characterize the acceleration response comprehensively. Thereafter, a manifold learning method, namely kernel locality preserving projection (KLPP), is performed to obtain manifold subspace from the feature matrix. KLPP is available to mine nonlinear information hidden in the feature matrix, which makes it different from the linear subspace analysis method. This merit enables KLPP to be more effective in exploring the intrinsic model of the feature matrix. Further, kernel principal angles that represent similarity between the manifold subspaces are calculated. Finally, a manifold subspace distance is derived from the kernel principal angles. This distance is an appropriate metric for measuring closeness or similarity between the subspaces embedded on a manifold. The distance between manifold subspaces from normal state and damage state of a machinery structure is defined as a damage index. Effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by two case studies with regard to damage assessment for different machinery structures. The results show that the defined damage index is not only sensitive to the occurrence of structural damage but also increases obviously with the increasing damage level. These positive results illustrate that the proposed scheme has promise for future performance and is a valuable method for damage assessment. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84881581016	Mechanical fault diagnosis model based on multiwavelet packet and neighborhood rough set	To overcome the difficulties in recognizing the compound faults of machanical equipment, a novel mechanical fault diagnosis model based on multiwavelet packet, neighborhood rough set and multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. In the model, the raw signals are decomposed via multiwavelet packet, and the features in time domain are extracted from the raw signals and each decomposed signal to construct the original features. Then, the sensitive features are selected by neighborhood rough set method and input into the multi-class SVM to automatically identify different conditions of mechanical equipment. The model is applied to fault diagnosis of rolling bearings in electric locomotive. The application results demonstrate that multiwavelet packet enables to extract more abundant fault information and obtain higher classification accuracy than traditional wavelet packet; neighborhood rough set enables to select sensitive ones from a large number of original features to rapidly and more correctly diagnosis the mechanical faults. Therefore, this model possesses significant advantage in diagnosis of compound faults.

84881312436	Detecting of transient vibration signatures using an improved fast spatial-spectral ensemble kurtosis kurtogram and its applications to mechanical signature analysis of short duration data from rotating machinery	Detecting transient vibration signatures is of vital importance for vibration-based condition monitoring and fault detection of the rotating machinery. However, raw mechanical signals collected by vibration sensors are generally mixtures of physical vibrations of the multiple mechanical components installed in the examined machinery. Fault-generated incipient vibration signatures masked by interfering contents are difficult to be identified. The fast kurtogram (FK) is a concise and smart gadget for characterizing these vibration features. The multi-rate filter-bank (MRFB) and the spectral kurtosis (SK) indicator of the FK are less powerful when strong interfering vibration contents exist, especially when the FK are applied to vibration signals of short duration. It is encountered that the impulsive interfering contents not authentically induced by mechanical faults complicate the optimal analyzing process and lead to incorrect choosing of the optimal analysis subband, therefore the original FK may leave out the essential fault signatures. To enhance the analyzing performance of FK for industrial applications, an improved version of fast kurtogram, named as "fast spatial-spectral ensemble kurtosis kurtogram", is presented. In the proposed technique, discrete quasi-analytic wavelet tight frame (QAWTF) expansion methods are incorporated as the detection filters. The QAWTF, constructed based on dual tree complex wavelet transform, possesses better vibration transient signature extracting ability and enhanced time-frequency localizability compared with conventional wavelet packet transforms (WPTs). Moreover, in the constructed QAWTF, a non-dyadic ensemble wavelet subband generating strategy is put forward to produce extra wavelet subbands that are capable of identifying fault features located in transition-band of WPT. On the other hand, an enhanced signal impulsiveness evaluating indicator, named "spatial-spectral ensemble kurtosis" (SSEK), is put forward and utilized as the quantitative measure to select optimal analyzing parameters. The SSEK indicator is robuster in evaluating the impulsiveness intensity of vibration signals due to its better suppressing ability of Gaussian noise, harmonics and sporadic impulsive shocks. Numerical validations, an experimental test and two engineering applications were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique. The analyzing results of the numerical validations, experimental tests and engineering applications demonstrate that the proposed technique possesses robuster transient vibration content detecting performance in comparison with the original FK and the WPT-based FK method, especially when they are applied to the processing of vibration signals of relative limited duration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84882241637	An improved independent component analysis by reference signals and its application on source contribution estimation	To estimate the contribution of main vibration and noise sources of vehicles, a source contribution estimation method based on an improved independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm is proposed. A measure of the similarity between the independent components and the reference signals with given characteristics is introduced. A widely used contrast function, namely kurtosis, is enhanced by the measure to obtain an improved contrast function. By means of fixed-point iteration and deflation approach, the improved contrast function is optimized and the improved ICA algorithm is attained. The contribution is computed by the reduced energy in each extraction, the reduction of the energy corresponds to the contribution of the extracted independent components. The correspondence relationship between the independent components (ICs) and source signals can be obtained by the signal characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by numerical simulation and experiment. © 2013 IEEE.

84882253792	Pseudo non-dyadic second generation wavelet tight frame for machine fault diagnosis	This paper investigates a novel wavelet tight frame (WTF) constructing strategy for obtaining pseudo second generation bases with non-dyadic time-frequency partition grids. The proposed constructing strategy starts with a known second generation wavelet basis and applies it in an undecimated filterbank. Via forward and inverse transformation procedure, an input signal is decomposed into a set of dyadic wavelet packets. By introducing a systematic way of wavelet packet reordering and ensemble wavelet generating method, another corresponding set of non-dyadic wavelet packets are generated. It is demonstrated that the derived pseudo non-dyadic second generation wavelet packets (PNSGW) are associated with well-defined band-pass filters, which ensure good time-frequency localizability and exact shift-invariance. The PNSGW strategy is combined with spectral kurtosis to detect incipient faults in mechanical systems. The processing results show that the proposed technique is a well complement to conventional dyadic wavelet transform in investigating transient impulse responses caused by faulty mechanical components. © 2013 IEEE.

84883062508	Dissimilarity measures for ICA-based source number estimation	Most of blind source separation problems are carried out with a priori knowledge of the source numbers. However, for source separation-based machinery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, it is a challenge work to determine the number of sources for a well source separation due to complex structures and nonlinear mixing mode. Therefore, source number estimation is a necessary and important procedure prior to source separation and further diagnosis work. In this paper, we focus on a novel source number estimation method based on independent component analysis (ICA) and clustering evaluation analysis, and investigate the performances of different dissimilarity measures of ICA-based source number estimations with typical mechanical vibration signals. Our work contributes to find an effective solution of source number estimation for source separation-based machinery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

84893680430	Novel method for bearing performance degradation assessment - A kernel locality preserving projection-based approach	Bearing performance degradation assessment is meaningful for keeping mechanical reliability and safety. For this purpose, a novel method based on kernel locality preserving projection is proposed in this article. Kernel locality preserving projection extends the traditional locality preserving projection into the non-linear form by using a kernel function and it is more appropriate to explore the non-linear information hidden in the data sets. Considering this point, the kernel locality preserving projection is used to generate a non-linear subspace from the normal bearing data. The test data are then projected onto the subspace to obtain an index for assessing bearing degradation degrees. The degradation index that is expressed in the form of inner product indicates similarity of the normal data and the test data. Validations by using monitoring data from two experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © IMechE 2013.

84899618397	Investigations of denoising source separation technique and its application to source separation and identification of mechanical vibration signals	A novel vibration source separation and identification method using the denoising source separation (DSS) technique is proposed for the mixed mechanical vibration signals from engines in ships. Denoising source separation enables us to extract the source signals from the mixed signals without prior knowledge of sources and their mixing mode, and thus the important source information extracted by DSS can be used to monitor or actively control engine noises. Different denoising functions such as energy, skew, kurtosis, and tangential functions in DSS are applied to both simulation studies and experimental data to evaluate their separating performances. The tangential function provides the best outperformance with both numerical study and engineering application. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed DSS method is validated by correlation analysis and the frequency marker tracking method.

84899621237	A comparative study of information-based source number estimation methods and experimental validations on mechanical systems	This paper investigates one eigenvalue decomposition-based source number estimation method, and three information-based source number estimation methods, namely the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Minimum Description Length (MDL) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and improves BIC as Improved BIC (IBIC) to make it more efficient and easier for calculation. The performances of the abovementioned source number estimation methods are studied comparatively with numerical case studies, which contain a linear superposition case and a both linear superposition and nonlinear modulation mixing case. A test bed with three sound sources is constructed to test the performances of these methods on mechanical systems, and source separation is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the experimental studies.

84902377297	Kurtosis-based constrained independent component analysis and its application on source contribution quantitative estimation	Aiming at finding the major vibration and noise sources of vehicles, a quantitative estimation method for source contribution using the kurtosis-based constrained independent component analysis (cICA) algorithm is proposed. First, the similarity between the ICs and the reference signals with given characteristics is described by a concise and effective closeness measurement function. Meanwhile, how to choose the reference signals and the choice of some other closeness measurements is discussed. Then, a widely used contrast function, namely, kurtosis, is modified by the closeness measurement to obtain an enhanced contrast function. The fixed-point iteration and deflation approach are employed to train the separating matrix. Then, the enhanced contrast function is therefore maximized and the kurtosis-based cICA algorithm is obtained. After that, the source contribution is quantitatively calculated by the reduced energy of the mixed signals in each extraction: the reduction of the energy in mixed signals corresponds to the contribution of the extracted IC. The correspondence relationship between the ICs and source signals can be obtained by prior knowledge. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by numerical simulation and experiments. The results show that the proposed method has high accuracy in separating sources and quantitatively calculating the source contribution. © 2014 IEEE.

84902810110	Detecting the bonding state of explosive welding structures based on EEMD and sensitive IMF time entropy	With the increasing application of explosive welding structures in many engineering fields, interface bonding state detection has become more and more significant to avoid catastrophic accidents. However, the complexity of the interface bonding state makes this task challenging. In this paper, a new method based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and sensitive intrinsic mode function (IMF) time entropy is proposed for this task. As a self-adaptive non-stationary signal analysis method, EEMD can decompose a complicated signal into a set of IMFs with truly physical meaning, which is beneficial to allocate the structural vibration response signal containing a wealth of bonding state information to certain IMFs. Then, the time entropies of these IMFs are calculated to quantitatively assess the bonding state of the explosive welding structure. However, the IMF time entropies have different sensitivities to the bonding state. Therefore, the most sensitive IMF time entropy is selected based on a distance evaluation technique to detect the bonding state of explosive welding structures. The proposed method is applied to bonding state detection of explosive welding pipes in three cases, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84903770372	A comprehensive study of vibration signals for a thin shell structure using enhanced independent component analysis and experimental validation	Vibration source information (source number, source waveforms, and source contributions) of gears, bearings, motors, and shafts is very important for machinery condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and especially vibration monitoring and control. However, it has been a challenging to effectively extract the source information from the measured mixed vibration signals without a priori knowledge of the mixing mode and sources. In this paper, we propose source number estimation, source separation, and source contribution evaluation methods based on an enhanced independent component analysis (EICA). The effects of nonlinear mixing mode and different source number on source separation are studied with typical vibration signals, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated by numerical case studies and experimental studies on a thin shell test bed. The conclusions show that the proposed methods have a high accuracy for thin shell structures. This research benefits for application of independent component analysis (ICA) to solve the vibration monitoring and control problems for thin shell structures and provides important references for machinery condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

84904409247	State recognition of the viscoelastic sandwich structure based on the adaptive redundant second generation wavelet packet transform, permutation entropy and the wavelet support vector machine	The viscoelastic sandwich structure is widely used in mechanical equipment, yet the structure always suffers from damage during long-term service. Therefore, state recognition of the viscoelastic sandwich structure is very necessary for monitoring structural health states and keeping the equipment running with high reliability. Through the analysis of vibration response signals, this paper presents a novel method for this task based on the adaptive redundant second generation wavelet packet transform (ARSGWPT), permutation entropy (PE) and the wavelet support vector machine (WSVM). In order to tackle the non-linearity existing in the structure vibration response, the PE is introduced to reveal the state changes of the structure. In the case of complex non-stationary vibration response signals, in order to obtain more effective information regarding the structural health states, the ARSGWPT, which can adaptively match the characteristics of a given signal, is proposed to process the vibration response signals, and then multiple PE features are extracted from the resultant wavelet packet coefficients. The WSVM, which can benefit from the conventional SVM as well as wavelet theory, is applied to classify the various structural states automatically. In this study, to achieve accurate and automated state recognition, the ARSGWPT, PE and WSVM are combined for signal processing, feature extraction and state classification, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a typical viscoelastic sandwich structure is designed, and the different degrees of preload on the structure are used to characterize the various looseness states. The test results show that the proposed method can reliably recognize the different looseness states of the viscoelastic sandwich structure, and the WSVM can achieve a better classification performance than the conventional SVM. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed ARSGWPT in processing the complex vibration response signals and the powerful ability of the PE in revealing the structural state changes are also demonstrated by the test results. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84907090702	Identification method for structural damage based on acoustic signal	Increased demands on the reliability of key equipment have created the need for its important components to be non-destructively inspected after main production processes, and detected on-line in the working state. Due to the difficulty of existing structural damage identification methods in meeting requirements for convenience or efficiency, a new model based on acoustic signals is constructed, with advantages such as non-contact measurement, high efficiency, and on-line detection. The emphases of the model are signal denoising, feature extraction, and the sensitive feature selection of damage based on distance evaluation. This model is applied to crack damage identification of the cantilever beam and switch machine's traction pole. The results show a 100% correct recognition rate, with high speed of recognition. Thus, this model is effective and feasible, and provides a new method for the identification of structural damage.

84907575760	Novel ensemble analytic discrete framelet expansion for machinery fault diagnosis1	As the celebrated "mathematical scope", the multi-resolution analyzing capacity of wavelet transform (WT) plays an important role in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. However, it has proven that the effectiveness of WT is hampered by several negative factors, such as shift-sensitiveness, significant energy leakage, and the fixed dyadic "frequency-sale" paving. Especially, the dyadic "frequency-sale" paving creates inevitable deficiency in identifying mechanical signatures located in transition areas of adjacent wavelet scales. A novel "time-sale" analysis methodology, named as derived ensemble analytic framelet (DEAF), based on overcomplete wavelet tight frame, is proposed. The DEAF is developed based on the existing dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). The DEAF starts from a selected DTCWT basis, and combines it with a hybrid augmented tree-structured filter-bank, which results in quasi analytic wavelet packet decomposition (QAWPD). With the results of QAWPT, an ensemble wavelet packet generating strategy is applied such that an unprecedented implicit wavelet packet tight frame (IWPTF) containing pseudo dyadic wavelet packets is obtained. With the combination of QAWPD and IWPTF, the proposed DEAF can be derived which possesses the "frequency-sale" paving characterized by continued time-frequency refinement of analysis centers. The proposed technique is applied to the mechanical signature analysis of an engineering application to validate its superiority compared with the existing methods.
