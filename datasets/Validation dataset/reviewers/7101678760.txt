21144450515	Research on measurement of bankrupt risks	The factors that determine the bankrupt risk can be represented both qualitatively and quantitatively. To effectively recognize, measure and control bankrupt risk, an approach is suggested combining qualitative recognition with quantitative calculation based on modeling. A method based on parameter distribution and fuzzy recognition is adopted to classify bankrupt risk. In addition, a probability inference for bankrupt, a probability model to measure bankrupt risk and a probability distribution function of businesses lifetime are given. Focusing on business assets and based on the pricing theory of financial options, the model of bankrupt probability is developed. Finally, a planning model to control bankrupt risk is given.

33750585396	Empirical study on liquidity and volatility in Chinese stock market	In Chinese stock market where all the stock buying/selling actions have to be done via an order-commission system, the bid-ask spread is really a market spread and it reflects the immediate trading costs in transactions. Spread and depth are the two important liquidity indices. Analyzing both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets, it is found that in Chinese stock market the liquidity is relatively higher and volatility slightly lower than other countries. When comparing horizontally, it is shown that the liquidity in the two stock markets has no obvious difference, and the stock price volatilities in the two markets are much synchronized. It indicates that the homogeneity of investors' behavior makes the business operation of the two markets similar eventually.

36448996656	Multifractal description of stock price index fluctuation using a quadratic function fitting	In order to obtain a quantitative multifractal characterization of the stock price index, the multifractal spectrum of Shanghai stock price index time series in 2005 was investigated and the multifractal spectrum was fitted using a quadratic function. A sliding window of 240 frequency data in 5 trading days was used to investigate the stock price index fluctuation. The multifractal parameters and coefficients in each window were obtained by fitting the local multifractal spectrum using a quadratic function. It is found that when the stock price index fluctuates sharply, a strong variability is clearly characterized by the multifractal parameters and the quadratic function coefficients. This has led to a better understanding of complex stock markets. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

37149045300	Co-integration of high-frequency data between the call warrants and their underlying target stocks on Shanghai Stock Market	The Black-Scholes option pricing model is often applied to pricing the warrant, which has some strict hypotheses and therefore the underlying target assets affect greatly the pricing practice. When there is no co-integration relationship between warrants and underlying target stocks, the Black-Scholes option model can not confirm the price of warrants efficiently. EG test and Johansen test are used to analyze the co-integration between the call warrants in Shanghai Stock Market and its underlying target stocks, and the result shows no co-integration between them. Moreover, the price trend of the call warrants will deviate from their underlying stocks, thus limiting the pricing practice to a certain extent when using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. It reveals the serious speculation in our warrant market.

84887240580	Analysis of the temporal properties of price shock sequences in crude oil markets	As one of the fundamental energy sources and important chemical raw materials, crude oil is crucially important to every country. Especially, the price shock of crude oil will bring about hidden dangers in energy security and economic security. Therefore, investigating the dynamics of frequent price shocks of crude oil markets seems to be crucial and necessary. In order to make the conclusions more reliable and valid, we use two different representations of the price shocks (inter-event times and series of counts) to study the temporal properties of price shock sequences in crude oil markets, such as coefficient of variation, Allan Factor, Fano Factors, Rescaled Range analysis and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. We find evidence that the time dynamics of the price shock sequences can be considered as a fractal process with a high degree of time-clusterization of the events. It could give us some useful information to better understand the nature and dynamics of crude oil markets. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that the returns term does not exert any effect on the information spillover among industries. The market factors significantly strengthen the bilateral information spillover effects among industries and significantly weaken the unilateral information spillover effects among industries. The information spillover effects tend to be strengthened or weakened with the ups and downs of the market. The individual industry's information spillover ability takes on the distribution of a higher peak and a fat tail. Furthermore, with the MST (minimal spanning tree) method, the rules of information spillover among industries can be found quickly and effectively.

43549089772	The forecasting research of stock price index by the symbol sequence	Using two kinds of symbol sequence as the condition, this paper presents an empirical research on the data of Shanghai Stock Price Index. One is the symbol sequence of closing index; the other is the symbol sequence of multifractal spectrum parameter. The result shows that, the Shanghai stock market is not totally efficient, the index fluctuating is not strictly random, and either of these two conditional probabilities has the forecasting capacity. It is also found that the correlation between the condition of different symbol sequences and the larger fluctuation of stock price index is stronger than the correlation between the condition and the smaller fluctuation of stock price index when threshold values are greater. These remarks can be used to predict the probability of the near future price movements.

62549141870	Measuring multifractality of stock price fluctuation using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis	Analyzing the Shanghai stock price index daily returns using MF-DFA method, it is found that there are two different types of sources for multifractality in time series, namely, fat-tailed probability distributions and non-linear temporal correlations. Based on that, a sliding window of 240 frequency data in 5 trading days was used to study stock price index fluctuation. It is found that when the stock price index fluctuates sharply, a strong variability is clearly characterized by the generalized Hurst exponents h (q). Therefore, two measures, Δ h and σ, based on generalized Hurst exponents were proposed to compare financial risks before and after Price Limits and Reform of Non-tradable Shares. The empirical results verify the validity of the measures, and this has led to a better understanding of complex stock markets. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

67349139621	A network analysis of the Chinese stock market	In many practical important cases, a massive dataset can be represented as a very large network with certain attributes associated with its vertices and edges. Stock markets generate huge amounts of data, which can be use for constructing the network reflecting the market's behavior. In this paper, we use a threshold method to construct China's stock correlation network and then study the network's structural properties and topological stability. We conduct a statistical analysis of this network and show that it follows a power-law model. We also detect components, cliques and independent sets in this network. These analyses allows one to apply a new data mining technique of classifying financial instruments based on stock price data, which provides a deeper insight into the internal structure of the stock market. Moreover, we test the topological stability of this network and find that it displays a topological robustness against random vertex failures, but it is also fragile to intentional attacks. Such a network stability property would be also useful for portfolio investment and risk management. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

According to the hope, object and permitting difference given by investor, the membership was taken as object function. The models of the linear membership function and the non-linear membership function were discussed. When the membership function takes value between [0, 1], the solution of two models has no big difference and reflects, the satisfactory degree of the customer. The parameter of the non-linear membership function corresponds to fuzzy scale of the investor's profit rate and the risk. These values are smaller and the fuzzy scale is smaller compared with the linear membership function. It is well shown that the investor takes the value intention for the object value. For the data of ten stock profit rate in Shen Zhen stock market, the evolution programming is adopted to wage the optimization calculation and to verify the effectiveness of the model.

77952497124	Multifractal statistical description and its sources for time series of returns on futures price	According to the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, an investigation on the time series of returns on the copper and soy bean futures prices in China was done empirically. It was found that the time series of returns on both futures prices are characterized with the leptokurtic especially the multifractality and not distributed normally, thus indicating that a single-scale index is insufficient to describe the commodity futures price fluctuation. Furthermore, the cause of multifractality was analyzed and it was found that most multifractality of the data is due to different long-range correlations for either small or large fluctuation. This correlations result in the price return series to be a biased random walk, i.e. the stock market fails to reach the soft efficiency.

The results shown that the efficiency loss resulted from incentive mechanism will increase as the degree of information transparency in security market reduces, while decrease with the increase of the investment horizon. And the reputation mechanism set up by the fund family will exert a kind of favorable reputation transfer function, which will promote the incentive efficiency to increase, and achieve Pareto optimality under the given conditions. The practical applications of the model are revealed at last.

84879713444	Characteristics of the merger target firm in post non-tradable share reform era-an empirical study on the listed companies in Chinese equity market	Characteristics of the merger target firm were investigated based on Chinese capital market and institutions in post non-tradable share reform era with the listed companies of A share market taken over in 2009~2011, using statistical analysis such as ANOVA and Logit model. It shows that the targets companies usually have inefficient managements, large firm size, low equity liquidities, lower growth rate and insufficient financial resources. The trading volume and turnover rate of the targets can reflect the merger in advance. The operating capacity, debt paying ability and capital to expand capacity well explain the merger target firm. The Logit model can well help to identify the merger targets.

0345868309	Research on the fractal structure in the Chinese stock market	Applying fractal theory, this paper probes and discusses self-similarity and scale invariance of the Chinese stock market. It analyses three kinds of scale indexes, i.e., autocorrelation index, Hurst index and the scale index on the basis of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) algorithm and promotes DFA into a recursive algorithm. Using the three kinds of scale indexes, we conduct empirical research on the Chinese Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. The results indicate that the rate of returns of the two stock markets does not obey the normal distribution. A correlation exists between the stock price indexes over time scales. The stock price indexes exhibit fractal time series. It indicates that the policy guide hidden at the back influences the characteristic of the Chinese stock market. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

84890813835	Impact of dynamic inconsistency on optimal long-term contracts	With the repeated moral hazard of long-term contracts aimed at and the agent of time preference taken into account, a three-period incentive model was developed and the impact of dynamic inconsistency on long-term contracts was then explored. The results showed that dynamic inconsistency does not change the memorability of long-term contracts, i. e. the high output at the current stage will positively affect the agent's payoff in the later periods; dynamic inconsistency does change the martingales of different periods, and the agent's optimal utility in Period 1 is less than the expected value in Period 2 and Period 3.

84890848357	Effects of non-tradable shares reform on the structural stability of china's stock cross-correlation networks	By collecting the yield data of Shanghai and Shenzhen A shares from 2002 to 2012, this paper constructs the stock cross-correlation networks of pre-, in- and post-non-tradable shares reform periods and empirically studies the networks' structural stability under perturbations. The results demonstrate that from the perspective of yield synchronization and maximal eigenvalue of correlation matrix, the networks' structural stability is not changed in the process of the non-tradable shares reform, and is strengthened after this reform. Moreover, from the perspective of the networks' basic topological features, the reform does not significantly affect the stability of network average shortest path length and average clustering coefficient under perturbations. This study might provide guidance to portfolio investment and risk management in the stock markets.

84901253347	The impact of gender and working experience on intertemporal choices	Intertemporal choice has been drawing attention in econophysics and neuroeconomics. In this paper, we experimentally estimate the parameters and AICc (Akaike Information Criterion with small sample correction) of intertemporal choice models (exponential, simple hyperbolic, quasi hyperbolic, and q-exponential) for senior undergraduate students and MBA students, respectively. Our results show that (1) regardless of gender or working experience, q-exponential discount model always generates minimum AICc value, and it is thus the optimal discount model; (2) gender affects the degree of inconsistency and fitness of the discount model. Comparing to female participants, male participants have a higher degree of inconsistency while their discount pattern is better explained by q-exponential discount model; (3) working experience has an interaction effect with gender. For male participants, working experience is inversely related to the degree of inconsistency and the fitness of q-exponential discount model. On the contrary, for female participants, working experience is positively related to the degree of inconsistency and the fitness of q-exponential discount model. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84904971819	Stable distribution and long-range correlation of Brent crude oil market	An empirical study of stable distribution and long-range correlation in Brent crude oil market was presented. First, it is found that the empirical distribution of Brent crude oil returns can be fitted well by a stable distribution, which is significantly different from a normal distribution. Second, the detrended fluctuation analysis for the Brent crude oil returns shows that there are long-range correlation in returns. It implies that there are patterns or trends in returns that persist over time. Third, the detrended fluctuation analysis for the Brent crude oil returns shows that after the financial crisis 2008, the Brent crude oil market becomes more persistence. It implies that the financial crisis 2008 could increase the frequency and strength of the interdependence and correlations between the financial time series. All of these findings may be used to improve the current fractal theories. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84905281490	An empirical study on the relationship between executive rewards and merger and acquisition of Chinese listed companies	Based on the M&A (merger and acquisition) of Chinese listed companies from 2005 to 2010, this paper empirically studies the relationship between executive rewards and M&A. The M&A samples include types of stock ownership replacement and asset transactions, and they are divided into four sub-samples according to the majority stockholder's characteristics of acquiring companies and whether this M&A being before or after the non-tradable shares reform. The results demonstrate that the company asset size induced by M&A has significant positive effects on the executive rewards. There are no significant relationship between the company's past business performances and the executive rewards. The degree of ownership concentration is positively related with executive rewards. At last, the non-tradable shares reform has exerted great influences on the ownership concentration degree. © 2014 IEEE.

84907590648	The effects of optimism bias in teams	This article imports a behavioural perspective into a team context to study the effort-coordination problem among agents. Specifically, we investigate how the presence of optimism bias impacts the severity of the free-rider problem, the organizational structure of the team and the compensation contracts offered to agents in equilibrium. The results indicate that all agents become more reluctant to exert effort and the team welfare decreases when some of its agents are optimistic, suggesting that optimism aggravates the free-rider problem in teams. Appointing a team leader makes all agents work harder, and the team benefits more by having the optimistic agent as its leader. These findings are in sharp contrast to the effects of overconfidence as identified in the literature. It is advisable to pay the optimistic agents less than the rational agents. Encouragingly, optimistic agents can learn about their own bias in the long run, leaving their team without too much detriment of optimism.
