84936776775	The R219K Polymorphism on ATP-Binding Cassette Transporter A1 Gene is Associated with Coronary Heart Disease Risk in Asia Population: Evidence from a Meta-Analysis	A number of case–control studies have been conducted to investigate the relationship between the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene polymorphisms and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the results have been inconclusive. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether this polymorphism confers significant susceptibility to CHD using a meta-analysis. We conducted searches of the published literature in PubMed, Embase, and CBM databases. 13 studies were included in our meta-analysis, involving a total of 11,678 individuals. Subgroup analyses were performed by ethnicity and cancer type. Statistically significant association between ABCA1 gene R219K polymorphism and increased CHD risk was found in total population analyses in all four genetic comparison models (OR<inf>C vs. T</inf> 1.19, 95 % CI 1.07–1.31; P = 0.001; OR<inf>Homozygote model</inf> 1.28, 95 % CI 1.07–1.52; P = 0.007; OR<inf>Recessive genetic model</inf> 1.22, 95 % CI 1.04–1.44, P = 0.015; OR<inf>Dominant model</inf> 1.21, 95 % CI 1.07–1.35; P = 0.001). In subgroup analyses based on ethnicity, the association was still significant in Asians (All P values < 0.001), but not in Caucasians (All P values > 0.05). ABCA1 R219K polymorphism is associated with CHD susceptibility, and individuals with ABCA1 have a significantly higher risk of cancer particularly in Asians.

84939874470	Clinical Research of Treatment with Tirofiban for High-Risk Non-ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome During Peri-Operative Intervention Operation Period	The objectives of this study are to explore the clinical effects of treatment with tirofiban for high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) during peri-operative intervention operation period and to improve the level of clinical treatment. Ninety cases of high-risk NSTE ACS patients were randomly selected from January 2011 to April 2013 as the research objects, which were divided into two groups: the control group and the observation group. The control group received conventional aspirin, clopidogrel anticoagulation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) treatment, while the observation group took tirofiban treatment in addition to the treatment of control group. The differences in major adverse cardiovascular events, TIMI flow grading, and complications of the two groups were observed after treatment. There were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the distal vascular blockage of major adverse cardiovascular events, intra-operative no-reflow, reoccurrence of acute myocardial infarction and stenocardia, and post-PCI TIMI flow grades 2 and 3. But in terms of bleeding complications, and TIMI flow grades 0 and 1 before PCI and after PCI, there was no significant difference (P > 0.05). Application of tirofiban treatment for high-risk NSTE ACS during the peri-intervention period is safe and effective, which can improve TIMI flow, increase tissue perfusion, and reduce postoperative complications.

33747364677	Evaluation of protective effect of ischemic postconditioning on myocardial function of dogs with real-time three-dimensional echocardiography and Doppler tissue imaging	Aim: To evaluate the value of protective effect of ischemic postconditioning on systolic and diastolic function of the myocardium and left ventricle of dogs after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3D) and Doppler tissue imaging (DTI). Methods: The experiment was conducted at the Cardiovascular Test Center, Department of Experimental Animal and Department of Pathology, First Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University between 2004 and 2006. Totally 16 hybrid dogs were randomly divided into control group and postconditioning group (n=8). The ramus descendens anterior arteriae coronariae sinistrae was occluded for 240 minutes followed by 120 minutes reperfusion in the control group. After deligation for 240 minutes in the postconditioning group, bulldog clamp was used, and then reperfusion for 30 s, ischemia for 30 s, repetitively for 3 times, and then followed by reperfusion for 118.5 minutes. RT-3D was performed before deligation, deligation for 240 minutes and reperfusion for 120 minutes to measure left ventricular ejection fraction, at the same time to detect the DTI parameters of systolic velocity (Sa), early diastolic velocity (Ea), late diastolic velocity (Aa) and Ea/Aa ratio at anterior left ventricular wall and mitral annulus. Sa in anterior wall represented local systolic function of myocardium. Ea, Aa and Ea/Aa indicated local diastolic function of myocardium. Left ventricular ejection fraction represented global left ventricular systolic function. Ea, Aa and Ea/Aa of mitral annulus indicated global left ventricular diastolic function. Results: A total of 15 dogs were involved in the final analysis. 1 There was insignificant change in Aa, while the Sa, Ea and Ea/Aa of myocardium of anterior wall of the two groups after ischemia significantly decreased. There was insignificant difference between the two groups. Each decreased parameter recovered gradually after reperfusion, but did not recover to basic value. Above items in the control group recovered to 44%, 43% and 52% of the basic value, respectively, and recovered to 74%, 64% and 69% in the postconditioning group. The recovery was more obvious in the post-conditioning group as compared with the control group. 2 Left ventricular ejection fraction, Sa, Ea, Ea/Aa of mitral annulus markedly declined in the two groups after ischemia, while there was insignificant change in Aa. There was insignificant difference between the two groups. Each parameter recovered slightly after reperfusion, but did not recover to the basic value. Left ventricular ejection fraction, Ea, Ea/Aa in the control group recovered to 32%, 34% and 38% of the basic value, respectively, while recovered to 60%, 52% and 54% in the postconditioning group, respectively. The recovery was great in the postconditioning group as compared with the control group. Conclusion: Ischemic postconditioning can protect local myocardium, global left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after myocardial ischemic and reperfusion. RT-3D and DTI can quantitatively measure local myocardium and left ventricular function.

33750874254	Assessment of protective effect of preinfarction angina on myocardial and microvascular damage by myocardial contrast echocardiography	Objective: To evaluate the relationship between preinfarction angina (PA), microvascular reflow, and myocardia function myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). Methods: In 37 patients with a first acute myocardial infarction we noninvasively assessed the microvascular perfusion with intravenous myocardial contrast echocardiography and 3-month follow-up echocardiography. The percentage extent of contrast defect after MCE within the risk area and left ventricular volume were evaluated. Results: Typical angina was present in 19 patients and absent in 18 patients during the 7 days preceding the myocardial infarction. Compared with those patients without PA, patients with PA showed a greater microvascular reflow extent (P<0.05). The patients with PA had a better regional myocardial function expressed with significantly less pronounced left ventricular dilation at follow-up despite being similar in the first echocardiogram. Conclusion: Presence of preinfarction angina, because of the preconditioning effect, reduces myocardial damage and favors myocardial viability, limiting left ventricular remodeling.

Left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) were occluded 30 min in ischemia group, dogs in reperfusion group were studied at LAD ligation 30 min, following reperfusion 120 min. Dogs without LAD ligation were used as control group. The left ventricular segmental function were detected by echocardiography using strain rate anlysis software. The percentage of apoptosis in left myocardial dysfunction was detected by terminal deoxynudeotidy transferease-mediated biotinylated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL). Caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Results: The peak strain rate (SRpeak) in ischemia group decreased obviously (P<0.01), and postsystolic compression (PSC) was found in ischemia segment. SRpeak increased slightly after reperfusion 120 min, but still decreased than control group. The positive cell of TUNEL detected in ischemia myocardial had no difference between ischemia group and control groups, and increased in reperfusion group (P< 0.05). Caspase-3 mRNA and protein expression increased more significantly in ischemia group than that in control group. And significantly increased in reperfusion group (P<0.01). Conclusion: Caspase-3 expression and cell apoptosis may be the early changes following acute ischemia reperfusion in dogs, which are related to the left ventricular segmental function.

34548756874	Cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the expressions of bcl-2, bax protein in adriamycin-induced myocardial damage in rabbits	Aim: To study cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the expressions of bcl-2 and bax protein in adriamycin (ADM)-induced myocardial damage in rabbits treated with different doses of ADM. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Experimental Center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University from June 2005 to August 2006. Forty-two New Zealand purebred white rabbits were stochastically divided into four groups: 1 Control group (n =10): Rabbits received 2 mL/kg normal saline by intravenous injection, once a week for 8 weeks. 2 ADM at 4 mg/kg group, 8 mg/kg group and 16 mg/kg group (n =10, 10, 12): Rabbits were given 2 mg/kg ADM, which was diluted with normal saline intravenously, once a week for 2, 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. Twelve weeks later, rabbits were executed under anesthesia, apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. The expressions of bcl-2 and bax protein were determined by immunohistochemical method through mean absorbance. Results: Except 3 deaths in ADM at 16 mg/kg group, other 39 rabbits were all involved in the result analysis. 1 Observation by transmission electron microscope: There were no apoptotic cardiomyocytes in control group and 4 mg/kg group, however apoptotic cardiomyocytes were found in 8 mg/kg group and 16 mg/kg group, appearing cellular nucleus shrank and nuclear chromatin condensed. 2 The index of apoptotic cardiomyocytes increased significantly in 8 mg/kg group and 16 mg/kg group compared with control group (P < 0.01). 3 Compared with control group, the expression of bcl-2 protein was significantly lower in 8 mg/kg group and 16 mg/kg group (P < 0.01), the expression of bax protein was significantly higher (P < 0.01), and bcl-2/bax was significantly lower. The expression of bcl-2 protein was significantly lower in 16 mg/kg group than in 8 mg/kg group (P < 0.01), however the expression of bax protein was significantly higher (P < 0.01). The expressions of bcl-2 and bax protein together with bcl-2/bax in 4 mg/kg group were closed to those in control group (P > 0.05). Conclusion: There is no apoptotic cardiomyocytes in ADM 4 mg/kg group due to low dose, and typical cardiomyocyte apoptosis is found in 8 and 16 mg/kg groups, presenting in a dose-effect manner. It is indicated that cardiomyocyte apoptosis is an important pathological mechanism of ADM-induced myocardial damage, and the effect may be related to the down-regulation of bcl-2 protein expression and up-regulation of bax protein expression.

Immunohistochemistry and western-blot anylysis of NF-ΚB protein expression. Results: NF-ΚB was obviously expression on injury myocardium of IR group, and increased significantly in contrast to control group (P < 0.05). However, the expression of NF-ΚB was reduced in PDTC group and had significant difference than that of IR group (P < 0.05). While apoptosis index of the ischemical myocardium of PDTC groups significantly decreased than that of IR group (P < 0.05). The peak strain rate (SRpeak) in IR group decreased obviously in contrast to C group (P < 0.01), SRpeak increased in PDTC group comparing with IR group (P < 0.05). But there was no significant difference in LVEF between three groups (P > 0.05) Conclusions: NF-ΚB might play an important role in acute myocardial ischemia reperfusion. PDTC reduces myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury by preventing expression of factor NF-ΚB.

Methods: Fifty-one healthy volunteers were regarded as the subjects. The IVS was observed at long axis view of left ventricle, short axis view of left ventricle and apical 4-chamber view. The central line of bright band in IVS was thought as the dividing line, thus the thicknesses of left and right ventricular sides of IVS (TLV and TRV, respectively) were measured at these three scanned planes, and the ratio of TLV to TRL was calculated. Results: The bright band of IVS that divided the IVS into left and right ventricular sides was clearly shown with echocardiography. At anterior IVS, TLV was thicker than TRV; at middle and posterior IVS, TLV and TRV were roughly the same. With naked hands, the IVS of boiled swine's heart could easily be divided into two parts, of which the characteristics in thickness were unanimous to the results of echo-cardiographic examination of 51 healthy volunteers. Conclusion: IVS could be divided into two structural layers, the left and right ventricular sides; with echocardiography, the interface of the two layers of IVS can be shown, i. e., the bright band, and the thicknesses of left and right ventricular sides can be accurately measured.

Methods: Ninety-five patients with small gastric subepithelial masses detected by gastroscopy examination were enrolled. For each patient, TUS-OCCA was performed prior to EUS by a skilled examiner. TUS-OCCA diagnoses were compared with those of EUS. Results: TUS-OCCA had a detection rate of 94% (89 of 95) in visualizing small gastric subepithelial masses previously detected by gastroscopy. The sizes of 6 undetected masses ranged from 7 to 12 mm (4 located at the fundus, 2 at the cardia). All of six patients whose lesions were undetected by TUS-OCCA were obese. The findings of gastric subepithelial masses demonstrated by TUS-OCCA were similar to that shown on EUS. Conclusions: TUS-OCCA can provide useful information about small gastric subepithelial masses, especially for the patients who are not obese. It can be used to follow gastric submucosal tumors that are not excised. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.

41849108025	Evaluation of the left ventricular systolic synchrony in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography	Objective: To evaluate left ventricular (LV) systolic dyssynchrony in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT3DE). Methods: The RT3DE examination was performed in 76 patients with LVH including 34 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and 42 with hypertensive heart disease (HHD), and 40 controls. The difference (Dif) and standard deviation (SD) of the time to the point with minimal systolic volume (Tmsv) in 16 segments were measured and adjusted by the R-R interval (Tmsv 16-Dif and Tmsv 16-SD). Results: The Tmsv 16-Dif and Tmsv 16-SD were significantly higher in patients with HCM than in controls and patients with HHD, but no difference between controls and patients with HHD. Conclusion: The presence of LVH is not always associated with LV dyssynchrony,and the HCM is associated with more severe LV dyssynchron than HHD. RT3DE is an useful and reliable technique for detecting LV dyssynchrony of all 16 segments simultaneously.

Methods: 30 T2DM patients with normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF≥55%), 30 normal controls were selected. The peak strain of segments in apical long-axis, four-chamber, and two-chamber views were evaluated, and average peak strain in the long axis at basal, middle and apical levels were assessed by automated functional imaging (AFI). Results: LVEDV, LVESV, SV and LVEF in T2DM patients and normal controls were all within normal limits. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). Compared with normal controls, the peak strain at each plane in T2DM patients was significantly reduced (P<0.01). Conclusion: The long-axis regional systolic function of LV in the patients with T2DM is impaired ahead of global systolic function disturbance. 2D-SE may be used to identify early abnormalities of systolic function in T2DM patients with normal LVEF.

80052835666	Sonographic findings predictive of the need for surgical management in pediatric patients with small bowel intussusceptions	Purpose: This study aims to evaluate ultrasound findings that are predictive of the need for surgical management in pediatric patients with small bowel intussusceptions (SBIs). Methods: A retrospective review of pediatric patients with SBIs treated from 2004 to 2009 was conducted. Patients were divided into surgical and non-surgical groups. Demographic data, ultrasound findings, treatments, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: There were 56 cases of SBIs in 31 males and 25 females ranging in age from 4 months to 9 years; 39 patients were managed conservatively and 17 patients underwent surgery. The mean length and diameter of the intussusception in the surgical group were 6.53 and 2.78 cm, respectively, and 3.21 and 1.81 cm, respectively in the non-surgical group (both, P∈<∈0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that diameter, length, and thickness of the outer rim were independent predictors of surgery. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated an intussusception diameter ≥2.1 cm, length ≥4.2 cm, and thickness of the outer rim ≥0.40 cm were optimal cutoff values for predicting the need for surgery. Conclusions: A diameter ≥2.1 cm, length ≥4.2 cm, and thickness of the outer rim ≥0.40 cm predict the need for surgical management in pediatric patients with SBIs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84860110754	Differential diagnosis of hepatic tumor-like lesions with real time contrast enhanced ultrasonography	Objective: To observe the blood flow characteristics of hepatic tumor-like lesions with CEUS. Methods: Totally 41 lesions in 35 patients of tumor-like lesions were evaluated. Among them, 21 cases were confirmed with surgery, 14 with enhanced CT/MRI or follow-up. Results: Hyperenhancement in the arterial phase was observed in all 13 FNHs (13/13, 100%). Central spoke wheel-shaped enhancement during early arterial phase was found in 10 cases of FNH, while central enhancement and a transient peripheral unenhanced zone was seen in 3 FNHs. Hyperenhancement in the portal venous phase was seen in all FNHs (13/13, 100%), while hyper or isoenhancement (11/13, 84.62%) and central hypoenhancement (2/13, 15.38%) were detected in the late phase. Twelve patients with solitary necrotic nodules (SNN) showed no enhancement throughout three phases, but the size and shape were all different. Four patients with inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver (IPL) showed diffuse hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and washout rapidly in portal venous phase. In 6 patients with focal fatty change (FFC), hyperenhancement (2/6, 33.33%), hypoenhancement (1/6, 16.67%) and isoenhancement (3/6, 50.00%) were found in arterial phase, whereas isoenhancement in the portal venous and late phase were noticed in all 6 patients. Conclusion: FNH, SNN and FFC have specific performance during CEUS. IPL should be differentiated from primary hepatocellular carcinoma.

84860505838	Quantitation of the volume of left ventricular models by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography: experimental study	Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3DE) full volume and X-plane for quantifying the volume of left ventricular (LV) models. Methods: Twenty-two different rubber bursas (include 10 normal LV models and 12 irregular LV aneurysm models, 53-292 ml) were quantified by RT-3DE full volume and X-plane respectively. The volumes were calculated using Philips iE33 3DQ Advance software online, which compared with 2DE (measured by Simpson method) and true volume (measured by drained water) using correlation analysis and Bland-Altman methods. Results: In the 10 normal LV models, excellent correlation coefficients and low variability were observed between the three methods and the true volumes. In the 12 LV aneurysm models, excellent correlation coefficients and low variability were observed in the volumes measured by RT-3DE full volume and X-plane, there was no significant difference between the two methods and the true volumes. However, there was difference between 2DE and true volume (P<0.05), and the consistency was not acceptable. Conclusion: Comparing with 2DE, RT-3DE full volume and X-plane can quantify LV volumes accurately, X-plane was more rapidly, and full volume was more accurate, which provide a new method for quantifying LV geometric volume and function accurately, conveniently and rapidly.

84860507278	Application progresses of real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography in diagnosis and interventional treatment of atrial septal defect	Transcatheter closure of atrial septal defects (TCASD) has excellent success rate for treatment of ASD. Appropriate selection of patients and suitable device implantation remain crucial for the procedure's success. Real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3D-TEE) is a recently developed technique that allows acquisition of high-quality RT3D images. Using RT3D-TEE, a defect of the interatrial septum (IAS) can be visualized enface. The accurate measurements of defect size and area, better estimation of the rim, as well as the spatial relationship between the ASD and cardiac structure can be easily demonstrated. RT3D-TEE allows continuous visualization of the procedure of TCASD, verification of the absence of flow across the device minimizing the complications. RT3D-TEE is a powerful new imaging tool that may become the technique of choice and the standard of evaluation of ASD morphology and for interventional guidance. The application progresses of diagnosis and interventional treatment of ASD using RT3D-TEE were reviewed in this article.

Objective: To observe the presence of intramural or subserosal gas in small bowel intussusception, and to evaluate their correlation with successful reducibility. Methods: Ultrasonic findings of 34 patients with small bowel intussusception were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: Among 34 patients with small bowel intussusceptions, successful reducibility was obtained in 23 patients (67.65%) by conservative treatment or ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction, in 11 (32.35%) by surgical treatment. In 10 patients with intramural gas, conservative treatment or ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction failed in 7 (7/10, 70.00%), while in 12 intussusceptions with subserosal gas, conservative treatment or ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction failed in 8 (8/12, 66.67%) patients, and surgical treatment was performed and succeeded in these 15 patients. The presence of intramural or subserosal gas predicted a lower chance of reduction by conservative treatment or ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction (P<0.05). Conclusion: The presence of intramural or subserosal gas in patients with small bowel intussusception significantly decreased the chance of reduction by conservative treatment or ultrasound guided hydrostatic reduction, indicating the necessity of surgical operation.

Methods: 2D echocardiography and RT-3DE images of 26 patients with isolated anterior mitral cleft were analyzed, including the shape and location of the cleft, mitral regurgitation (MR) and so on. Results: Among 26 patients with isolated anterior mitral clefts, clefts of 23 patients located near the commissure of mitral valve, 3 were on the middle part. Clefts combined with mitral valve prolapse and rupture of chordae tendineae were detected in 8 patients. For the shape of the cleft, 15 were like "I", the others liked "C" or "S". Five cases were found without MR, while 9 with moderate-severe MR. Conclusion: A discontinuous anterior mitral valve with an echo-lost in the video image along mitral valve short-axis is confirmed as the specific diagnostic feature for isolated anterior mitral cleft. Color Doppler flow imaging shows that the regurgitant jet originate from the cleft. Continuous 2D echocardiographic scan with the help of RT-3DE can demostrate clearly the position, shape and extent of isolated anterior mitral cleft.

Patients were divided into responders and non-responders, based on a reduction ≥15% in LVESV after CRT. Results: Twenty-seven patients (55.10%) were classified as responders. Compared with non-responders, there was no difference in preoperative state, while the responders demonstrated a significant increase of LVEF, LAPEF, LAAEF, SRs-LA, SRs-IAs, SRe-LA, SRe-IAs, SRa-LA, SRa-IAs on the interatrial septum and the lateral wall of the left atrium, and LVESV decreased (all P<0.05). Conclusion: CRT can promptly increase the left atrial function. STE are readily obtained parameters that provide unique data about atrial function.

84860638582	Evaluation of left ventricular torsion in patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with two-dimensional ultrasound speckle tracking imaging	Objective: To explore the value of two-dimensional ultrasound speckle-tracking imaging (STI) in assessing the left ventricular torsion (LVtor) in patients with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM). Methods: Thirty-four patients with AHCM and 21 healthy volunteers underwent two-dimensional echocardiography. High frame rate two-dimensional images of left ventricular short-axis views at the levels of mitral annulus and apex were obtained. Peak rotation (Prot) and the time to Prot, peak rotation velocity on basal and apical plane in left ventricular short-axis views, the peak twist (Ptw) and time to peak twist, half time of untwisting (HTU) were measured using two-dimensional strain software while twisting rate (Untw R) was calculated. All the above indices were compared between patients and healthy volunteers. Correlation was analyzed between HTU and E, A, E/A ratio. Results: Compare with healthy volunteers, Prot and time to Prot and peak rotation velocity on apical plane in AHCM significantly increased, so did Ptw and peak rotation velocity of left ventricular (all P<0.05). HTU delayed with the Untw R and peak untwisting velocity decreased in the AHCM group (all P<0.05). There was negative correlation between HTU and E/A ratio in patients with AHCM. Conclusion: When the left ventricular systolic function maintained normal in patients with AHCM, the peak rotation on apical plane and the LVtor increased with Untw R decreased. STI can sensitively evaluate the function alteration of myocardium in patients with AHCM.

84860640848	Assessment on the spatial structure of mitral annular in the normal subjects with real time three-dimensional echocardiography	Objective: To investigate the changes of mitral annular shape during the cardiac cycle in the healthy subjects with real time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3DE). Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects underwent RT-3DE. The three-dimensional images were analyzed with Philips cardio-view analysis software QLab 6.0, mitral annular was reconstructed with three-dimensional structure image, and all indexes of mitral annular were calculated. Results: Mitral annulus stereo configuration could be reconstructed accurately and annular parameters could be calculated with three-dimensional coordinate. The mitral annulus kept saddle shape during the cardiac cycle. The annular circumference, area, anteroposterior diameter, left-right diameter and height were smaller, but anteroposterior degree and left-right degree were larger in systole than those in diastole. Conclusion: The annular stereo configuration can be three dimensional reconstructed accurately with RT-3DE, which can be used as a noninvasive method to research mitral annular dynamics in human being.

Methods: Twenty-seven patients with pathologically confirmed primary HCC were enrolled, including 16 with poorly to moderately differentiated HCC and 11 with well differentiated HCC. The hepatic tissues around HCC in 13 patients were selected as control. CEUS images before operation were analyzed. Time-intensity curve was drawn and the parameters such as intensity time, rising slope, relative peak intensity, peak enhancement rate, descending slope were calculated. VEGF was located with immunohistochemistry method and quantitatively analyzed with Western-blot method. The correlation between the parameters of enhancement time-intensity curve and VEGF expression was analyzed. Results: VEGF was mainly distributed in cytoplasm. The quantitative analysis showed that the relative value of VEGF was (46.63±9.70)% in moderately to poorly differentiated HCC, (32.36±8.56)% in well differentiated HCC, and (8.85±5.05)% in control group, statistical differences were found between each two groups (all P<0.05). The relative peak intensity of HCC was positively correlated to VEGF expression(r=0.56, P<0.05), while no correlation was found with intensity time, rising slope, peak enhancement rate nor descending slope (all P>0.05). Conclusion: The relative peak intensity of HCC may indicate VEGF expression, and the relative value of VEGF in different differentiated HCC is obviously different.

84864649915	Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography of the rabbit VX2 tumor model: Analysis of vascular pathology	The accuracy of diagnosing t umors may be improved significantly by detecting the microvascular distri- bution. Indeed, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) has shown a distinct advantage in detecting microvasculature. This study aimed to determine the angiogenic characteristics of VX2 tumors in rabbits using CEUS. A total of 17 rabbits were injected with 0.5 ml VX2 cell suspension into the muscles of both hind legs to prepare the VX2 tumor models. At 14, 21, 28 and 35 days after tumor inoculation, CEUS was performed on the rabbits with 0.3 ml SonoVue following a local anesthesia. The pathological findings of the tumors were compared. A total of 12 rabbits survived after being inocu- lated with the tumor cells and developed a total of 38 tumors. The size of the tumors ranged from 1.12 to 10.85 cm. Using CEUS, all tumors demonstrated rim enhancement with some unenhanced regions. Enhancement began from the periph- eral region and quickly showed internal reticular vessels. Regardless of the tumor size or the presence of necrosis, no complete enhancement of the tumors was observed. On microscopic examination, VX2 tumor cells were detected in striated muscles, immature blood capillaries and fibrosis tissues scattered in tumor nests. Im munohistochem ical examination revealed that CD34+ cells appeared mainly in the muscles adjacent to vessels. In conclusion, CEUS may be an efficient method to evaluate angiogenesis and blood perfusion in VX2 tumors.

84864501171	Observation on variations of curvature radius of interventricular septum in atrial septal defect patients with speckle tracking imaging	Objective To compare atrial septal defect (ASD) patients with normal adults about variations of curvature radius of interventricular septum (IVS) throughout the cardiac cycle with speckle tracking imaging (STI). Methods Short-axis images at the basal and middle levels were recorded in 24 ASD patients (ASD group) and 20 control subjects (control group). Radius curvature (RC) and RC ratio (RCR) of IVS and left ventricular lateral-posterior wall (LVLPW) were measured and calculated with STI. Results There was statistical difference between changes of the basal and middle levels of IVS RC and LVLPW RC in ASD group at the end of diastole (all P < 0.05), but not during systole (all P > 0.05). There was also statistical difference between changes of the basal and middle levels of IVS RC in ASD group and in controls at the end of diastole (all P < 0.05), but not systole (all P > 0.05). In addition, both the basal and middle levels of RCR in ASD group were statistically different with those of the controls at the end of diastole (all P < 0.05), but not systole (all P > 0.05). In the control group, no statistical difference of RC was found between IVS and LVLPW at the end of systole or diastole (all P > 0.05). Conclusion IVS RC of ASD patients was greater in diastolic than in systolic, and the pressure changes between left ventricular and right ventricular in ASD patients can be evaluated by observing the variations of IVS RC.

84870065130	Evaluation of normal fetal pulmonary veins using B-flow imaging with spatiotemporal image correlation and by traditional color Doppler echocardiography	Objective: The purpose of our report is to evaluate the use of color Doppler echocardiography (CDE) with four chamber view (4CV), scanning around left atrium, and four-dimensional echocardiography with B-flow imaging and spatiotemporal image correlation (4D BF-STIC) in detecting fetal pulmonary veins at 17 to 40weeks' gestation. Methods: This was a prospective study. Color Doppler echocardiography with 4CV, scanning around left atrium, and 4D BF-STIC were used to detect the pulmonary veins in 460 normal fetuses at 17 to 40weeks of gestation. Routine prenatal screening was used to confirm that the fetuses were in good health with no cardiac or extra cardiac anomalies. All patients underwent follow up at one year. Twenty-two patients were excluded from the study. The number of pulmonary veins visualized using each method was recorded and then compared in six subgroups according to gestational age. Results: Four-dimensional echocardiography with B-flow imaging and spatiotemporal image correlation was the best method to detect the greatest number of pulmonary veins between 17 and 31weeks of gestation. Scanning around left atrium detected more pulmonary veins than the traditional 4CV method throughout the gestational period. Conclusions: The scanning around left atrium method proved to be the most suited for detecting pulmonary veins in clinical practice. 4D BF-STIC was superior in detecting the greatest number of pulmonary veins before 32 gestational weeks, but had limited clinical usage because it was very time-consuming and experience-dependent. The 4D method should be considered as a complement to traditional two-dimensional sonography, because it facilitates understanding of the anatomy and the spatial relationships of the cardiac structures. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84872114170	Neovascularized myxoma-causing abnormal blood flow in the left atrium diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography	Myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumor, and neovascularization of cardiac myxoma has been shown in previous case reports. However, it is seldom reported that abnormal blood flow spurted from a neovascularized myxoma into the cardiac chamber. In this unusual case report, we present a left atrial myxoma in a 44-year-old woman with atypical angina. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) revealed several small blood streams spurting from the surface of massively vascularized myxoma into the left atrium. Coronary angiography showed a feeding artery which arose from the right coronary artery and supplied the left atrial myxoma, with no evidence of coronary artery stenosis. This case demonstrated that TTE might be helpful for confirming the neovascularization of myxoma in the left atrium and finding the abnormal blood flow that spurts from the neovascularized myxoma. We speculate that the abnormal blood flow spurting from the neovascularized myxoma into the left atrium may have caused a coronary steal phenomenon thus resulting in myocardial ischemia. Mini-Abstract In this case report, we present a left atrial myxoma in a 44-year-old woman with atypical angina.

84875588397	Speckle tracking imaging in evaluation of radial strain of subendocardial and epicardial myocardium in canine acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion	Objective: To evaluate the radial strain function of subendocardial and epicardial myocardium in acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion canine with speckle tracking imaging. Methods: The first diagonal branch of left coronary artery of 20 adult healthy hybrid dogs were ligated. Radial strain of subendocardial and epicardial myocardium at basal, apical and papillary muscle level were compared by speckle tracking imaging before ligation, ligation immediately, 60, 120, 180 min after ligation, reperfusion immediately, and 60, 120 min after reperfusion, respectively. Results: Radial strain of basal level elevated by compensatory role in canine acute ischemic process. Radial strain of apical and papillary muscle level decreased obviously. Myocardial reverse movement was even found at apical level. In acute ischemia and reperfusion process, subendocardial myocardium was more sensitive to ischemia. After reperfusion, radial strain of subendocardial and epicardial myocardium at apical and papillary muscle level were still lower than that in basic status. Conclusion: Speckle tracking imaging can objectively quantify regional and overall heart function and transmural extent of myocardial infarction in canine.

84875323510	Prenatal diagnosis of fetal unilateral lung agenesis complicated with cardiac malposition	Background: Fetal unilateral lung agenesis, complicated with cardiac shifting, is a rare anomaly, the diagnosis of which remains a challenge for many sonographers in routine screening programs. The present study describes a systematic approach for the diagnosis of fetal unilateral lung agenesis and cardiac malpositions in routine prenatal screening. Methods: A total of 18 cases of fetal unilateral lung agenesis complicated with cardiac malposition were reviewed. A systematic method was proposed to identify the fetal left side and right side according to the fetal head position and posture by acquiring a long axis and transverse view of the fetus. Fetal unilateral lung agenesis was diagnosed by evaluation of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery. The diagnosis was confirmed by postnatal echocardiography, digital radiology, and computed tomography after birth or by autopsy findings. Results: The left-sided fetal heart with the cardiac apex rotating to the left and posterior were confirmed in all 7 left lung agenesis cases, while the rightward shifting of the fetal heart together with the cardiac axis deviating to the right were confirmed in all 11 cases of right lung agenesis. The disappearance of the ipsilateral pulmonary artery was confirmed in all 18 cases of unilateral lung agenesis. Cardiac anomalies were present in a total of 7 of the18 cases of lung agenesis with 4 of 7 in cases of left lung agenesis and 3 of 11 in cases of right agenesis. Conclusions: The systematic approach introduced in the current report is helpful in the diagnosis of fetal unilateral lung agenesis complicated with cardiac malposition. The information provided by this study may be helpful to better understand unilateral lung agenesis anatomically and to facilitate its potential examination. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878494403	Application of CHADS2 score in prediction of left atrial/left atrial appendage thrombus in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation	Objective: To explore the correlation between CHADS2 score and prevalence of left atrial/left atrial appendage (LA/LAA) thrombus in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Methods: Clinical data of 187 NVAF patients were analyzed, and CHADS2 score were derived. The patients were divided into thrombus group and non-thrombus group based on the results of TEE. The association between CHADS2 score and prevalence of LA/LAA thrombus, and frequency differences of CHADS2 factors between thrombus group and non-thrombus groups were analyzed. Results: The prevalence of LA/LAA thrombus was 14.44% (27/187), and the detection rate of thrombus was 2.13% (1/47), 13.41% (11/82), 24.24% (8/33), 29.41% (5/17), 16.67% (1/6), 50.00% (1/2) in patients with CHADS2 score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. The prevalence of LA/LAA thrombus showed a trend of increase with the raising of CHADS2 score, and both of them had significant correlation (P=0.001).

84879182513	Left Atrial Systolic and Diastolic Dysfunction in Patients with Chronic Constrictive Pericarditis: A Study Using Speckle Tracking and Conventional Echocardiography	Background:Left atrial (LA) function plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiac output, however, in patients with constrictive pericarditis (CP), whether pericardial restriction and adhesion can lead to LA dysfunction, and the characteristics of LA function remain unclear. The aim of the study is to compare the left atrial (LA) function of patients with CP to that of healthy study participants using speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) and conventional echocardiography.Methods and Results:Thirty patients with CP and 30 healthy volunteers (controls) were enrolled in the study. The underlying cause of CP was viral pericarditis in 24 (80%) patients and unknown in 6 (20%) patients. The LA maximum volume (Vmax), LA minimal volume (Vmin), and LA volume before atrial contraction (Vpre-a) were measured using biplane modified Simpson's method. The LA expansion index (LA reservoir function) was determined as follows: ([LAVmax - LAVmin]/LAVmin) ×100. The passive emptying index (LA conduit function) was calculated as follows: ([LAVmax - LAVpre-a]/LAVmax) ×100, and the active emptying index (booster pump function) was calculated as follows: ([LAVpre-a - LAVmin]/LAVpre-a) ×100. All the patients underwent two-dimensional STE. The LA global systolic strain (S), systolic strain rate (SrS), early diastolic strain rate (SrE) and late diastolic strain rate (SrA) were measured. The LA expansion index, passive emptying index, the active emptying index and the LA global S, SrS, SrE, SrA were found to be significantly lower in patients with CP than in the control participants (P <0.001). LA function was correlated with the early diastolic velocity of the lateral mitral annulus (P <0.05).Conclusions:Although left ventricular systolic function was preserved in patients with CP, the LA reservoir, conduit, and booster functions were impaired. Pericardial restriction and impairment of the LA myocardium may play an important role in the reduction of LA function in patients with CP. © 2013 Liu et al.

84884908914	A novel plasmid and SonoVue formulation plus ultrasound sonication for effective gene delivery in nude mice	Aims This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of gene therapy mediated by ultrasound-targeted SonoVue using the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TSV-TK) driven by the kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) promoter (KDR-TK) for the treatment of ovarian carcinomas in nude mice. The optimized conditions for gene transfection were also explored. Main methods In this study, we developed a novel technique to deliver a plasmid vector-carried gene into tumor xenografts in sixty nude mice. We first mixed plasmid DNA with SonoVue to form microbubbles and then treated the mice with ultrasound sonication to enhance plasmid gene transfection and expression in tumor xenografts. Key findings The data showed that injection of pBluescript-KDR-TK cDNA mixed with SonoVue into nude mice plus ultrasound sonication significantly (Group E) increased the transfection efficiency and expression of KDR-TK mRNA in tumor xenografts. The growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice was significantly suppressed in Group E compared to the other four control groups (Groups A, B, C, and D, namely, treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), KDR-TK + PBS, KDR-TK + SonoVue, KDR-TK + PBS + ultrasound sonication, respectively). TUNEL staining showed that SonoVue plus ultrasound sonication significantly induced apoptosis and reduced microvessel density (MVD). Significance This study revealed that the formulation of plasmid with SonoVue plus ultrasound could provide efficient gene delivery into tumor xenografts. Increased gene expression was observed in vivo, which effectively reduced the tumor growth and MVD of tumor xenografts and induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Future clinical trials are necessary to further analyze the relevance of this technique. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84884949070	Ultrasonographic dimensions of the common bile duct in Chinese children: Results of 343 cases	Background At present, the diagnostic criteria of congenital cholangiectasis are still vague. Purpose The aim of this study was to assess the diameter references of the common bile duct (CBD) in pediatric population in different age groups with ultrasound. Methods The diameter of the common bile duct was measured with ultrasound in 343 Chinese Han children aged 1 day to 14 years (mean: 3.2 years, median: 2.8 years) who were all free of hepatic and biliary tract disease. The ultrasound records, gender, and age were collected for reviewed analysis. Results A total of 343 children were included, and the CBD was clearly detected in 322 cases (93.9%). The mean diameter of this population was 1.58 ± 0.70 mm. (ranging from 0.4 to 4.4 mm). Spearman correlation analysis showed that the diameter of CBD was positively associated with age (r = 0.573, P < 0.001). The percentile method demonstrated that the diameter references of CBD was as follows: ≤ 1 years: ≤ 2.26 mm; ≤ 4 years: ≤ 2.99 mm; ≤ 7 years: ≤ 3.03 mm; and ≤ 14 years: ≤ 4.10 mm. Conclusions There was a close correlation between CBD width and the age. The range of CBD widths in each age group will be helpful in the diagnosis of biliary dilatation in childhood. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84885936322	Evaluation on radial motion of damaged myocardium in newborn pigs model with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy using speckle tracking imaging technology	Objective: To observe the changes of radial motion of the damaged myocardium in newborn pig models with hypoxic ischemic-encephalopathy (HIE) with speckle tracking imaging (STI) technology. Methods: Eighteen newborn pigs were randomly divided into control group (n=8) and model group (n=10). The bilateral carotid arteries were blocked, and nitrogen oxygen atmosphere (6% oxygen and 94% nitrogen) were given mechanically through endotracheal intubation in the model group. In the control group, nitrogen oxygen atmosphere (40% oxygen) were given as the model group, but carotid arteries were not blocked. After 24 h, the peak value of radial strain (SR) and radial strain rate (SrR) of each segment were measured with STI. Then the average of global, base, middle and apex levels were calculated, the heart rate (HR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and Tei index were measured. The pathological slices of the myocardium and brain were observed at last. Results: Compared with the control group, the peak value of SR and SrR, LVEF decreased, HR and Tei index increased in the model group (all P<0.05). In the model group, swelling, degeneration, necrosis and apoptosis were found in some myocardial cells, while swelling, degeneration and necrosis were found in some brain glial cells and neuronal cells. Conclusion: The radial motion and heart function decreased in the early time of newborn pig HIE models. It is a reliable method to use newborn pigs model of HIE to simulate neonatal HIE with myocardial damage.

84896318222	Giant fibroadenomatoid hyperplasia of the breast: A case report	Fibroadenomatoid hyperplasia of the breast (FAHB) is a rare benign breast lesion and its clinical features are similar to fibroadenoma and fibrocystic changes. FAHB has been previously termed sclerosing lobular hyperplasia, fibroadenomatosis, fibroadenomatoid change, or fibroadenomatoid mastopathy. Typically, FAHB is derived from stroma and epithelia. The pathologic characteristics of FAHB are microfocal lobulocentric proliferation of stroma accompanied by epithelial and myoepithelial components resembling similar histological changes, as found in fibroadenoma, apocrine hyperplasia, intraductal hyperplasia, and lobular hyperplasia. FAHB could be present as a localized or diffused pattern in pathology. Most cases show no well-circumscribed mass lesions and no apparent capsules; it is usually identified as an incidental finding in other benign lesions or in random sampling in cancerous breast tissues. FAHB is categorized as a benign proliferative breast disease and it has previously been reported; however, the authors believe this study may be the first case with two giant masses reported. Fiber adenoma hyperplasia is a rare cystic hyperplasia of breast pathology and its ultrasonographic manifestations are easily confused with breast cancer. Comparative MRI ultrasound analysis will help make the differential diagnosis. © 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel.

84900470873	Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging in evaluation on left ventricular systolic function in patients with cardiac amyloidosis and hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy	Objective: To analyze strain characteristics of cardiac amyloidosis (CA) and hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (HLVH), and to observe clinical value of speckle tracking imaging (STI) in differentiating CA from HLVH. Methods: Totally 25 patients with CA (CA group), 20 with HLVH (HLVH group) and 27 healthy subjects (control group) were examined with echocardiography. Two-dimensional images were obtained, including left ventricular apical four-chamber view, three-chamber view, two-chamber view and 3 short-axis views (basal, papillary muscle and apical planes). The peak systolic circumferential strain (CS), radial strain (RS) and longitudinal strain (LS) of 16 segments were measured using QLab 8. 1 software. The basal, mid-LV and apical strains (CS, RS, LS) were obtained by averaging the corresponding strain values of segments at each level. The global CS, RS, LS (GCS, GRS, GLS) were obtained by averaging the corresponding strain values of all 16 segments. ROC curves were used to analyze value of routine echocardiographic and strain parameters in differentiating CA from HLVH. Results: (1)Compared with control group, the global, basal, mid-LV and apical strains (CS, RS, LS) in CA group significantly decreased (P<0.001), while the global strains (GCS, GRS, GLS), basal LS, mid-LV LS, apical LS, apical CS, mid-LV RS in HLVH group decreased (P<0.05). (2)Compared with HLVH group, the global, basal, mid-LV and apical strains (LS, CS, RS) in CA group significantly decreased (P<0.001). (3)Analysis of ROC curves demonstrated that strain parameters (GCS, GRS, GLS) had higher accuracy for discriminating CA from HLVH than those of DT and E/e (AUC 0.88, 0.90, 0.99 vs. 0.74, 0.82, respectively). Taking GLS>-12.91% as the cutoff value, GLS had highest sensitivity (100%) and specificity (95%) in differentiating CA and HLVH. Conclusion: 2D-STI is a feasible technique for assessing cardiac longitudinal, circumferential and radial systolic function in patients with CA and HLVH. GLS could be applied as an useful tool in discriminating CA from HLVH.

Methods Seventy-one women with perineal masses were referred consecutively for transvaginal ultrasonography. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound was used to scan the pelvic floor, including the urethra, vagina and rectum, and identify any possible areas of interest. A static three-dimensional (3D) sonographic reconstruction of the pelvic anatomy was created to further delineate the relation of the lesions with their neighboring structures. Ultrasound results were compared retrospectively with surgical pathology outcome when possible. Results Seventy-nine cystic, cystic-solid or solid masses were detected on transvaginal 2D ultrasonography in the 71 women: in 44 patients, 47 anechoic cystic masses were identified and diagnosed as vaginal wall cysts; in 19 patients, 23 hyperechoic cystic masses were diagnosed as vaginal epidermoid cysts; in each of two patients, a hypoechoic cystic-solid mass showing blood-flow signals on color Doppler imaging was diagnosed as urogenital angiomyofibroblastoma; in each of three patients, a hypoechoic cyst was diagnosed as urethral diverticulum; and in three patients with a known history of gynecological malignancy, solid heterogeneous masses with blood flow signals on color Doppler imaging were diagnosed as metastatic cancer. In all patients, 3D ultrasonography delineated the anatomical relationship of these masses to the vagina, urethra and rectum. Conclusions Transvaginal 2D and 3D ultrasonography is an accurate, non-invasive, cost-effective diagnostic modality for the delineation of congenital, septic and neoplastic lower urogenital tract perineal masses in women.

84902700559	Right atrial pressure alterations during echocardiography-guided- catheterization predict tricuspid valvular impairment: A novel method for the creation of a rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis	We previously reported the use of a catheter system to damage the tricuspid valve and create infectious endocarditis (IE) in an animal model. The current study aims to create a faint IE model suitable for antibiotic prophylaxis using a low bacterial inoculum. We also aim to explore a way to quantitatively assess valvular impairment and to predict the success of the IE models during catheterization. Methods. Ninety rabbits were assigned to two groups according to the density of bacteria inoculated (1 × 10
