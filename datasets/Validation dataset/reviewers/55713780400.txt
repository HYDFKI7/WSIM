19944378488	Impact properties, phase structure, compatibility, and fracture morphology of polyamide-1010/thermoplastic poly(ester urethane) elastomer blends	Blends of polyamide-1010 (PA1010) and a thermoplastic poly(ester urethane) elastomer (TPU) were prepared by melt extrusion. The impact properties, phase structure, compatibility, and fracture morphology under impact were investigated for PA1010/TPU blends. The results indicated that TPU enhanced the impact strength of PA1010, and the best impact modification effect of the blends was obtained with 20 wt % TPU. The phase structure was investigated with scanning electron microscopy, and the compatibility was investigated with dynamic mechanical analysis and small-angle X-ray scattering. The study of the fracture morphology of PA1010/TPU blends indicated that the fracture surface of the blends had special features, consisting of many fibrillar elastomer particles and a conglutination-multilayer structure, as well as many small tubers on this structure. These fracture phenomena could not be found on the fracture surface of pure PA1010. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33646493326	Synthesis and characterization of thermotropic liquid crystalline poly(arylether ketone) copolymers with pendant 3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl groups	Novel poly(aryl ether ketone) copolymers with pendant 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl groups were synthesized by the reaction of a crystal-disrupting monomer, 3-(trifluoromethyl)phenylhydroquinone (FH) and a mesogenic monomer, 4,4′-biphenol (BP) with 1,4-bis(p-fluorobenzoyl)benzene (BF). Thermotropic liquid crystalline behavior of the copolymers was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimetry, polarized optical microscope and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. As a result, the copolymers with the respective molar ratios of FH/BP/BF of 0/100/100-10/90/100 and 80/20/100-100/0/100 were semi-crystalline without liquid crystalline properties, and amorphous polymers, respectively. In contrast, copolymers with the molar ratio of FH/BP/BF/ of 20/80/100-70/30/100 had liquid crystalline characteristics. Interestingly, the formation of a highly ordered smectic phase was confirmed for copolymers with the molar ratio of FH/BP/BF of 20/80/ 100-50/50/100, respectively. All the liquid crystalline copolymers had a wide liquid crystalline temperature range (57-75°C). © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

33750632884	Toughening mechanism of PA1010/ester-based TPU blends	To improve the notched impact strength of polyamide-1010 (PA1010), it was modified with a thermoplastic poly (ester urethane) elastomer (ester-based TPU). The notched impact strength of PA1010/ester-based TPU blends was investigated by using an impact tester and the fracture morphology of PA1010/ester-based TPU blends was investigated by means of SEM. In the impact experiments, it was found that the notched impact strength of the blends is obviously higher than that of pure PA1010, and the fracture surfaces of the blends show a corrugated and oriented structure. The results indicate that the brittle-to-tough transition of the blends occurs when the content of ester-based TPU is 20 wt.% and there is a new toughening mechanism, which is the multi-layer crack extension mechanism, besides the crazing with a shear-yield mechanism in the process of fracture for the blend samples under impact. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33846227385	Effects of magnetic field and rare-earth ions on properties of polyaniline nanoparticles	The uniform polyaniline nanoparticles with the size of about 50 nm were electropolymerized using the method of constant potential of 0.8 V. The effects of rareearth cations and magnetic field on the preparation and properties of polyaniline were investigated. It was found that the addition of rare-earth cations could enhance the effect of magnetic field on the properties of polyaniline. The resulting products were characterized by FTIR spectra, UVvis spectra and scanning electron microscope (SEM); the conductivity and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were also investigated. The experimental results show that the magnetic field has an orientation effect on polyaniline chain and there exists the interaction between rare-earth cations and polyaniline chain because of the electrostatic interaction.

38849111209	Influence of regenerated PU on mechanical properties and thermal stability of PP	The possibility of polypropylene (PP) modification by regenerated polyurethane (PU), obtained after partial thermochemical decomposition of waste PU, has been studied. The partial thermochemical decomposition of waste PU was carried out using diethanolamine (DEA) in a one-screw extruder. The degradation product was a thermoplastic mixture, applicable for reuse without any purification and fractionation. The influence of regenerated PU on mechanical properties and thermal stability of PP was studied using universal testing machine (UTM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). The results showed that regenerated PU could be reused as an effectively polymeric plasticizer for PP and the addition of regenerated PU did not decrease the thermal stability of PP. © 2007.

The influence of regenerated PU on the mechanical properties and thermal stability of PP during multiple processing cycles was evaluated by a universal testing machine, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analyses.

84877810010	Frequency dependence of magnetization and giant magneto impedance effect of amorphous wires	The frequency dependence of magnetization process and giant magneto impedance (GMI) effect of Co-rich melt-extracted amorphous wires was studied by Kerr effect and impedance analyzer, respectively. It is demonstrated that the transverse Kerr intensity and the corresponding GMI response increase with increasing frequency, which contributes to the upgraded skin effect. However, the skin depth has a slothful trend with frequency when it is up to the megahertz range, which gives rise to the transformation of magnetization. The process is much more sensitive to the direct current magnetic field and the sensitive change of the circular permeability, and GMI response is observed as its consequence. This proves that the evolution of circumferential magnetization and the corresponding permeability with the direct current magnetic field is the essence of GMI response, and a much more sensitive magnetization promises a better GMI response. © 2013 University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

46949108630	Influence of third component on mechanical properties and thermal stability of polypropylene/(regenerated polyurethane) blends	The possibility of polypropylene (PP) modification by regenerated polyurethane (PU), obtained after partial thermochemical decomposition of waste PU, has been studied. The degradation product was a thermoplastic mixture, applicable for reuse without any purification and fractionation. It was proved that regenerated PU could be reused as an effective polymeric plasticizer for PP and that the addition of regenerated PU did not decrease the thermal stability of PP. In order to improve further the elongation at break of PP modified by regenerated PU, a third component was added to the PP/(regenerated PU) blend. The influence of the third component on the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the blends was evaluated by using a universal testing machine (UTM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The data showed that the elongations of PP/ (regenerated PU) blends with styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene polymer (SEBS) were obviously better than those of the PP/(regenerated PU) blend without the third component and with PP-g-MA or SEBS-g-MA (MA = maleic anhydride). In addition, the thermal stability of PP/(regenerated PU) blends with a third component was almost same as that of the PP/(regenerated PU) blend without a third component. © 2008 Society of Plastics Engineers.

49049109838	Preparation and characterization of polypropylene/waste ground rubber tire powder microcellular composites by supercritical carbon dioxide	In order to obtain 'value added products' from polypropylene (PP)/waste ground rubber tire powder (WGRT) composites, PP/WGRT microcellular foams were prepared via supercritical carbon dioxide. The effects of blend composition and processing condition on the cell size, cell density and relative density of PP/WGRT microcellular composites were studied. The results indicated that the microcellular structure was dependent on blend composition and processing condition. An increased content of waste ground rubber tire powder (WGRT) and maleic anhydride-grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS-g-MA) reduced the cell size, and raised the cell density and relative density, whereas a higher saturation pressure increased the cell size, and reduced the cell density and relative density. With increasing saturation temperature, the cell size increased and the relative density decreased, whereas the cell density initially increased and then decreased.

In this study, microcellular foams of TPV based on waste ground rubber tire powder (WGRT) were investigated. In order to investigate the relationship between processing conditions and structure of TPV foams, we first prepared the thermoplastic vulcanizates of PP-g-MA/WGRT, then the samples were saturated with carbon dioxide and the saturated specimens were expanded during the pressure-quench process. The results indicated that the microcellular structure was dependent on the processing conditions. Cell size increased with saturation temperature, whereas cell density and relative density decreased. Different nucleation processes were produced with saturation pressure. Crown Copyright © 2008.

54449095876	Crystallization Kinetics and Melting Behavior of PA1010/Ether-based TPU Blends	Polyamide 1010 (PA1010)/thermoplastic poly (ether urethane) elastomer (ether-based TPU) blends were prepared via melt extrusion. The crystallization kinetics and melting behavior of PA1010/ether-based TPU blends were systematically investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. The crystallization kinetics results show that the addition of ether-based TPU hinders the crystallization of PA1010, and the hindrance effect increases with the increase of the concentration of ether-based TPU. Both pure PA1010 and PA1010/ether-based TPU blends exhibit double melting peaks in the process of nonisothermal crystallization. The double melting peaks change differently with the variation of cooling rate and blend composition. The cooling rate only influences the lower melting peak; however, the blend composition influences not only the lower melting peak but also the higher melting peak. The reason for the phenomenon must be the interaction between the two compositions. © 2007 Jilin University.

It has been proved that partially replacing WPP with PP-g-MA increased the elongation at break of WPP/WGRT blends, whereas decreased the thermal stability. The presence of compatibilizer increased the elongation at break and thermal stability of WPP/WGRT blends, whereas decreased the processing flowability, as revealed by using universal testing machine (UTM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and capillary rheometer. Moreover, the tendency of the change became more obvious with the content of PP-g-MA and compatibilizer or with the combination of PP-g-MA and compatibilizer. In addition, the improvement of the nonpolar compatibilizer (SEBS) in properties of WPP/WGRT blends was better than that of the polar compatibilizer (SEBS-g-MA).

6344231253	Melting and crystallization behavior of PA1010/TPU blends	PA1010/TPU blends were prepared by melt blending. The melting, crystallization behavior, and isothermal crystallization kinetics were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that the DSC thermograms of blend samples exhibit double melting peaks. With increasing the TPU content, the position of the double melting peaks shifted to a lower temperature, and the total heat of fusion decreased. With increasing the heating rates, the position of the lower melting peak shifted to a higher temperature, while the position of the higher melting peak shifted to a lower temperature; however, the total heat of fusion remained almost constant. With prolong ing the annealing time and increasing the crystallization temperature, the position of the lower melting peak shifted to a higher temperature, while the position of the higher melting peak almost did not change; however, the total heat of fusion increased. The addition of TPU could promote the crystallization of PA1010 but not affect the crystallization mechanism. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

72949102426	Effect of carbon nanotubes on the mechanical properties and crystallization behavior of poly(ether ether ketone)	Pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and noncovalently functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) were used to prepare poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) composites (CNTs/PEEK and f-CNTs/PEEK) via melt blending. Noncovalently functionalized multiwalled nanotubes were synthesized using hydrogen-bonding interactions between sulfonic groups of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and carboxylic groups of nanotubes treated by acid (CNTs-COOH). The effects of these two kinds of nanotubes on the mechanical properties and crystallization behavior of PEEK were investigated. CNTs improved mechanical properties and promoted the crystallization rate of PEEK as a result of heterogeneous nucleation. Better enhancement of mechanical properties appeared in the f-CNTs/PEEK composites, which is ascribed to the good interaction between f-CNTs and PEEK. However, the strong interaction of f-CNTs and PEEK chains decreased the crystallization rate of PEEK for high content of f-CNTs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impedance response is measured at low frequencies(<13MHz) using HP4192 impedance analyzer. We get better GMI effect by heating wires at 60mA and 180mA.The connection between GMI response and transformation of structure under different heat current has been discussed. After proper heat treatment, magneto impedance response is strong even at 0.5MHz with GMI amplitude of 193.1% and field sensitivity of 59.4%/Oe.

Samples are prepared using melt extraction technology in vacuum and annealed at 450°C without magnetic field or with miagntic field either longitudinal or transverse to the axis of wire of strength from 500 Oe to 4000 Oe, respectively. The magnetic softness and GMI response are measured using HP4192 Impedance Analyzer and Lakeshore 7407 VSM. Test results show that the circular anisotropy and GMI response are reduced after longitudinal field anneal treatment. GMI profiles are single-peaked and the maximum impedance ratio ΔZ/Z is 131% and field sensitivity is 7%/Oe. The circular permeability and GMI response are improved after transverse field anneal treatments because of the increased circular anisotropy. At higher frequencies, the GMI profiles change from single-peaked to two-peaked after being annealed in strong transverse field. The circular permeability is increased and GMI effect gets stronger with the increase of current frequency and anneal field. The largest impedance ratio of 190% with a field sensitivity of 26%/Oe is obtained for the Co-based transverse field annealed wires at 10 MHz. The correlations between the circular permeability, the GMI effect and the current frequency are discussed in the light of a skin effect model. © 2010 Chin. Phys. Soc.

A novel high temperature lubricant, GENIOPLAST PELLETS (GPPS), was used to decrease the melt viscosity of PEEK and PEEK/CF composites. PEEK/ GPPS and PEEK/CF/GPPS compounds were characterized by dynamic rheometry, universal tester, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that a small amount of GPPS could decrease the melt viscosity of the compounds during processing, and improve the dispersion uniformity of the carbon fiber in the PEEK matrix, and further enhance the tensile strength of PEEK/CF composites, but have little effect the thermal stability of the compounds.

79952800241	Study of blends of linear poly(ether ether ketone) of high melt viscosity and hyperbranched poly(ether ether ketone)	Linear poly(ether ether ketone) (LPEEK) with high melt viscosity was blended with hyperbranched poly(ether ether ketone) (HPEEK) to enhance its melt processability without sacrificing its comprehensive performance. The advantage of using HPEEK is due to its unique spherical shape, low melt viscosity and ready availability. Rheological measurements show that blending LPEEK with as little as 1 wt% HPEEK results in about 17% reduction of melt viscosity. LPEEK/HPEEK blends only show one glass transition temperature, indicating complete miscibility, which results from the similar molecular structure of the two components. The HPEEK component, as rheology modifier, accelerates the crystallization rate of LPEEK. Notably, with the addition of 3 wt% HPEEK, the mechanical properties of LPEEK are improved. Good miscibility is proposed to be responsible for the improved mechanical properties. Moreover, the addition of HPEEK does not decrease the thermal stability of LPEEK.

The efficacy of the functionalization reaction of graphene was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images showed that the functionalized graphene can be easily exfoliated into functionalized graphene nanosheets composed of single or bilayers of graphene sheets. The f-G was used to prepare conductive poly (ether sulfone) (PES) composites (f-G/PES) via the solution casting method and the alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) properties of f-G/PES composites were investigated. It was observed that good dispersion of f-G nanosheets in PES matrix resulted in a low percolation threshold of 0.355 vol.%. Hopping type of charge transport occurred during the insulator-semiconductor transition of f-G/PES composites. Impedance measurement was carried out to evaluate interfacial capacitance of the composites, and the interfacial capacitance of the composites increased to 1041.9 pF of f-G/PES composites with 5 wt.% f-G from 30.48 pF of f-G/PES composites with 0.5 wt.% f-G. © SAGE Publications 2011.

The synthesis of 2,6-difluoro-4′-hydroxybenzophenone (AB2 monomer) was accomplished by the reaction of 2,6-difuorbenzoyl chloride with anisole, followed by deprotection of the phenolgroup with hydrobromide (HBr) in acetic acid. The polymerization of AB2 monomer in the presence of 4,4′-bis(2, 6-difluoro-benzoyl)diphenyl ether (B4 monomer) as a core molecule afforded F-HPAEKs with number-average molecular weights ranging from 5081 to 9964 Da and polydispersity index values ranging from 2.89 to 3.76. The presence of cyclic oligomeric species, formed by an intramolecular cyclization process, was a contributing factor to the relatively low molecular weights. The degree of branching (DB) of the HPAEK samples was estimated by a comparison of the 19F-NMR spectra of the polymer samples with those of a series of model compounds, and DB values ranging from 0.54 to 0.58 were determined. The glass transition temperatures for HPAEK samples were in the range of 157-176°C, as determined by differential scanning calorimetry. © The Author(s) 2012.

To evaluate the effect of the antioxidants on the properties of PEEK and the stabilization mechanism, some characterization methods were carried out, such as rheometer, TGA, and electron spin resonance (ESR). The results indicated that the efficiency of the phosphorous antioxidant (DS) in improving the stability of PEEK was better than that of the phenolic antioxidant (DN) and the thermal stability of PEEK sample containing 0.07 wt% DS was the best among all samples due to the decrease of the free radicals density, as proven by ESR measurement. The possible stabilization mechanism of the antioxidants to PEEK was proposed to reveal the reason that caused the different performances of the two types of antioxidants to PEEK. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Two series of sulfonated TFC NF membranes were prepared on a microporous polyphenylsulfone (PPSU) support membrane through an interfacial polymerization technique with trimesoyl chloride (TMC) solution and amine solutions containing 6FAPBS/6FBABDS and piperazine (PIP), and their properties including chemical composition, membrane morphology and hydrophilicity of the active layer were characterized by ATR-IR, XPS, SEM and contact angle measurement. After that, these resultant membranes were employed to perform dye treatment experiments with aqueous solutions of rhodamine B and methyl orange. The membranes prepared under the optimum condition showed an increase in the water flux by improving surface hydrophilicity which was enhanced by the presence of sulfonated aromatic diamine monomers without compromising the rejection of dyes. The introduction of sulfonic acid groups plays a major role in water permeation and rejection of dyes during TFC NF separation process. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

GMI effect gets worse with the length decreasing when the frequency is not higher than 1 MHz due to the border effect on the effective magnetic field. At the given frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum impedance ratio ΔZ/Z decreases from 8.07% to 1.03%. However, when it is over 1 MHz with the decrease of length, the reduction of resistance contributes to the higher circular permeability under the transformation of magnetization process and the skin effect. At the both sides role of border effect and the reduction of resistance, a drastic change in circular permeability occurs at an optical length. It is found that when it is about 7 mm, the GMI effect of this Co-rich amorphous microwires with a diameter of 34 μm is the most sensitive and the maximum ΔZ/Z is up to 86.1% at 8 MHz. This result is of important in selecting sample length at different frequencies for MI sensor design.

84863669028	Material with high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and good mechanical and thermal properties produced using multi-wall carbon nanotubes wrapped with poly(ether sulphone) in a poly(ether ether ketone) matrix	A material with high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, and good mechanical and thermal properties was produced using multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) wrapped with poly(ether sulphone) (PES) dispersed in a poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) matrix. The material was fabricated using melt-blending, and MWCNT/PEEK composites show different degrees of improvement in the measured dielectric, mechanical, and thermal properties as compared to pure PEEK. This is attributed to the high conductivity of MWCNTs, the effect of wrapping MWCNTs with PES, the good dispersion of the wrapped MWCNTs in PEEK, and the strong interfacial adhesion between the wrapped MWCNTs and the PEEK. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84865496382	Influence of the addition of lubricant on the properties of poly(ether ether ketone)/basalt fiber composites	Improvement in the processability of poly(ether ether ketone)/basalt fiber (PEEK/BF) composites with less influence on other properties is important. A novel high-temperature lubricant GENIOPLAST PELLETS (GPPS) was used in order to decrease the melt viscosity of PEEK/BF composites. The compounds of PEEK/BF/GPPS were characterized by torque of screw, universal tester, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that a small amount of GPPS could greatly decrease melt viscosity of the composites during processing, and improve the dispersion uniformity and orientation of BF in the PEEK matrix, followed by the enhancement of the modulus and strength of PEEK/BF composites, meanwhile the thermal stability of the compounds was almost unaffected. © The Author(s) 2012.

84865810800	Synthesis of sulfonated polyphenylsulfone as candidates for antifouling ultrafiltration membrane	This work focused on the synthesis of a series of sulfonated polyphenylsulfone (SPPSU) random copolymers with various controlled sulfonation levels by using sulfonated monomer in direct copolymerization method and the preparation of antifouling SPPSU ultrafiltration membranes via the conventional immersion precipitation phase inversion method. The chemical structures of the SPPSU copolymers were confirmed by using Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and their thermal properties were thoroughly characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The morphologies of the SPPSU membranes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the morphology changes of these resultant membranes had been detailedly explained and verified by Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) from thermodynamic theory. In addition, the surface hydrophilicity and charged property of the SPPSU membranes were studied by water contact angle and membrane potential measurements, and the results indicated that the sulfonation of membrane material is really an effective way to enhance the hydrophilicity and negatively charge the membrane. The pure water flux and protein solution permeation through the prepared membranes were increased with the increase of the degree of sulfonation. The cycle ultrafiltration experiments for protein solution revealed that nonspecific protein adsorption, especially irreversible protein adsorption, for the SPPSU membranes was significantly reduced, suggesting superior antifouling performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84867544201	Transparent CdTe/Py-PAEK microspheres/SPEEK nanocomposite films with UV-Full-Shielding property	This paper describes a novel polymer nanocomposite films with UV-shielding property, the novel films retain high visible light transmittance while shielding ultraviolet in all wavelengths. Firstly, microspheres with sizes ranging from 80 nm to 300 nm were prepared based on the hydrogen-bonding interaction of pyridine-terminated poly (aryl ether ketone) (Py-PAEK) and CdTe Nanocrystals and the packing of the rigid grafts (Py-PAEK). Whereafter a series of flexible CdTe/polymer microspheres/sulphonic poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) nanocomposite thin films were fabricated by solution casting approach. The results showed that the films exhibited excellent UV-Full-Shielding properties and highly transparent in the visible region. It also indicated that a small amount of microspheres could improve the UV-shielding capability of SPEEK. As the main solvent was water, the hazards to humans and the environment were significantly decreased. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84870407827	A material with high electromagnetic radiation shielding effectiveness fabricated using multi-walled carbon nanotubes wrapped with poly(ether sulfone) in a poly(ether ether ketone) matrix	An electromagnetic radiation absorber material with high shielding effectiveness as well as good mechanical and thermal properties was produced using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) wrapped in poly(ether sulfone) (PES) dispersed in a poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) matrix fabricated by melt-blending. The electromagnetic, mechanical, and thermal properties of this material were characterized using a vector network analyzer, universal tester, and thermal gravimetric analyzer, respectively. The results indicate that wrapped-MWCNT-PEEK composites show different degrees of improvement in the measured properties compared to pure PEEK. This is attributed to the high conductivity of MWCNTs, the good dispersion of wrapped-MWCNTs in PEEK, and the strong interfacial adhesion between wrapped-MWCNTs and PEEK. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84872849461	Evaluation of stabilization performances of antioxidants in poly(ether ether ketone)	Two types of antioxidants(a primary antioxidant and a secondary antioxidant) were used to improve the stability of poly(ether ether ketone)(PEEK). The effects of the antioxidants on the properties of PEEK and the stabilization mechanism were investigated by some characterization methods, such as rheometer, thermogravimetric analysis(TGA), universal tester and electron spin resonance(ESR). The results indicate that the efficiency of the phosphorous antioxidant(DS) in improving the stability of PEEK was better than that of the phenolic antioxidant(DN) in both melting stability and thermal stability, and the thermal stability of PEEK sample containing 0.07%(mass fraction) DS was the best among all the samples due to the decrease of the free radicals density, as proven by ESR measurement. Additionally, no obvious changes could be observed in mechanical properties of PEEK containing antioxidants compared to those of virgin PEEK.

84874840123	Novel hybrid acid-base membranes based on sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone), tetraethoxysilane and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane for fuel cell application	Two kinds of novel hybrid membranes with and without (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (KH550) were produced using tetraethoxysilane dispersed in sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone) (SPAES) matrix by the sol-gel method. The obtained hybrid membranes (SPAES-K-SiO2 and SPAES-SiO2) possessed higher water uptake, proton conductivities and selectivity compared with the pristine SPAES membrane when the SiO2 content was 3 and 6 wt%, whereas the same properties of the obtained hybrid membranes decreased when the SiO2 content was 10 wt%. In addition, the acid-base interactions between SPAES and SiO2 could improve the dispersion of the inorganic particles (SiO2) in the SPAES matrix. As a result, SPAES-K-SiO2 hybrid membranes presented better methanol permeability and selectivity than SPAES-SiO2 hybrid membranes without the acid-base interactions. © The Author(s) 2012.

84875266973	The preparation of antifouling ultrafiltration membrane by surface grafting zwitterionic polymer onto poly(arylene ether sulfone) containing hydroxyl groups membrane	This work describes the polymerization of a zwitterionic polymer, poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) [poly(MPC)] onto the poly(arylene ether sulfone) containing hydroxyl groups (PES-OH) membrane via redox graft polymerization using ceric (IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) as initiator. Due to the presence of the activated hydroxyl groups which were used for the immobilization of MPC monomer, the grafting process is facile and effective which avoid the complex and unfavorable pretreatment process and/or hydroxylated treatment. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR-ATR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the chemical compositions and surface morphologies of the unmodified (PES-OH) and modified membrane, respectively. Static water contact angle measurement indicated that the introduction of poly(MPC) promoted remarkably the surface hydrophilicity of the PES-OH membrane. The cycle ultrafiltration experiments for protein solution revealed that nonspecific protein adsorption, especially irreversible protein adsorption, for the zwitterionic membrane was significantly reduced, suggesting superior antifouling performance. This work not only introduces a modification approach to obtain a PES-OH membrane grafting hydrophilic poly(MPC) chains, but also gives the zwitterionic membrane a long time life and excellent ultrafiltration performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84879462104	Design and preparation of poly(aryl ether ketone)/phosphotungstic acid hybrid films with low dielectric constant	A material with low dielectric constant was produced using nanoparticle phosphotungstic acid (PWA) modified by the silane coupling agent γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH-550) dispersed in a poly(aryl ether ketone) containing (3-trifluoromethyl) phenyl side groups (FPEEK) matrix synthesized with (3-trifluoromethyl) phenyl hydroquinone (3FHQ) and 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone. The material was fabricated using solution-blending. Moreover, the dielectric, thermal, and mechanical properties of this material were characterized using a precision impedance analyzer, thermal gravimetric analyzer, and universal tester, respectively. The results indicate that modified PWA (m-PWA)/FPEEK composites show obvious improvement in the dielectric properties compared to unmodified PWA (p-PWA)/FPEEK composites. This should be attributed to the good dispersion and compatibility of m-PWA in FPEEK, as proven by scanning electron microscope and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. Besides, m-PWA/FPEEK composites also exhibited the relatively good thermal and mechanical properties. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84880879690	Preparation and characterization of high-performance poly(ether ether ketone) fibers with improved spinnability based on thermotropic liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ketone) copolymer	High-performance poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) fibers were prepared by melt-spinning in the presence of thermotropic liquid crystalline poly(aryl ether ketone) copolymer (FPAEKLCP). The rheological and mechanical properties, birefringence, orientation, and crystallization of the resulting PEEK/FPAEKLCP fibers were characterized by using a melt flow indexer, capillary rheometer, single fiber electronic tensile strength tester, polarized light microscopy (PLM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), respectively. The results indicate that the melt viscosity of PEEK significantly reduced by introducing FPAEKLCP, followed by the improvements in the spinnability and the quality of as-spun fibers. The tensile properties of PEEK/FPAEKLCP fibers mainly depend on the content of FPAEKLCP, drawing temperature, drawing ratio, and annealing processes. Moreover, the tensile strength and modulus of PEEK/FPAEKLCP fibers are obviously higher than those of neat PEEK fibers under the same processing conditions. This should be attributed to an enhancement in the orientation and crystallization of PEEK compounded with FPAEKLCP. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84884987241	Influence of the addition of lubricant on the properties of poly(ether ether ketone) fibers	A high-temperature lubricant genioplast pellets (GPPS) was used in order to improve the processing behavior of poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) resin and high-performance PEEK fibers were produced by melt-spinning. The rheological properties of spinning material, morphology, mechanical, and thermal properties of PEEK fibers were characterized by using a polymer capillary rheometer, scanning electron microscopy, single fiber electronic tensile strength tester, wide-angle X-ray diffraction and thermal gravimetric analyzer, respectively. The results indicated that the introduction of lubricant GPPS decreased the melting viscosity of PEEK resin and improved spinnability of PEEK resin without sacrificing its thermal properties. The filaments are cylindrical with smooth surface and uniform diameter. The optimized content of GPPS was determined to be 1.0 wt% by balancing the decreased torque and changes of the mechanical properties. The strength and modulus of PEEK fibers were 420 MPa and 3.6 GPa, respectively. This should be due to the improvement in spinnability, followed by the enhancements in the orientation and crystallization of PEEK fibers in the process of drawing and annealing. © 2013 Society of Plastics Engineers.

Their optical properties were evaluated by nonlinear optical analyses and optical limiting (OL). The results showed that these polymers possessed good OL properties and large nonlinear optical (NLO) susceptibilities. All polymer films-containing THPP presented excellent thermal stability (>460 C). Polymers bonded with -CH3 to the backbone exhibited better performances in OL and NLO properties than those bonded with -CF3; however, the thermal stability of the former was slightly inferior. Backbone bonded with electron donating groups was conducive to the OL and NLO properties. © The Author(s) 2013.

Moreover, the blend membranes of S-HPAEKs with sulfonated linear poly(aryl ether ketone) (S-LPAEK) (S-HPAEK/S-LPAEK) were prepared for proton exchange membrane. All the blends could be cast into tough membranes. The structure of S-HPAEKs was characterized and the thermal stability, water uptake, and proton conductivity of S-HPAEK/S-LPAEK membranes were investigated. The results showed that S-HPAEK/S-LPAEK membranes possessed good thermal stability, better water uptake, and good proton conductivity compared with the S-LPAEK membrane, and their properties depended on the ion exchange capacity and the content of S-HPAEK in the blend membranes. © The Author(s) 2013.

84888616235	Synthesis and characterization of highly branched sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone) copolymers as proton exchange membranes	Highly branched sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone) copolymers (Br-SPAEKs) were synthesized based on 4,4′-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphenol (A2 monomer), 4,4′-difluorobenzophenone (unsulfonated B2 monomer), 3,3′-disodiumsulfonyl-4,4′-difluorobenzophenone (sulfonated B2 monomer), and 3,4′,5-trifluoro-benzophenone (branched BB2′ monomer). Structures of Br-SPAEKs were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Compared to the linear SPAEK (L-SPAEK) copolymer membrane with similar ion exchange capacity, the Br-SPAEK-30 (branched monomer of 20 mol% and sulfonated monomer of 30 mol%) membrane showed higher proton conductivity and lower methanol permeability. This synergistic effect on proton conductivity and methanol permeability was mainly due to the characteristics of large free volume and similar cross-linking architecture arising due to the introduction of the branched monomers. Moreover, the selectivity of the Br-SPAEK-30 membrane is almost three times higher than that of the L-SPAEK membrane. Proton conductivities of Br-SPAEK membranes are higher than 10-2 S cm-1 and increase gradually with increasing temperature. At 80 C, the proton conductivity of the Br-SPAEK-50 (branched monomer of 20 mol% and sulfonated monomer of 50 mol%) membrane reaches 0.127 S cm-1, comparable to that of Nafion-117 (0.139 S cm-1). Additionally, the methanol permeability of Br-SPAEK-50 is one order magnitude lower than that of Nafion-117. © The Author(s) 2013.

As the compatibility agent, PEEK-b-PI was added to the poly(ether ether ketone)/thermoplastic polyimide (PEEK/TPI) blend, and blends of PEEK/TPI/PEEK-b-PI were prepared by melt extrusion. Morphology observation showed the domain size of the dispersed phase was significantly reduced with the addition of PEEK-b-PI having optimized block length, which suggested reduced interfacial tension and enhanced interfacial adhesion. The compatibilizing effect was further proven by the change of the glass transition temperature of PEEK and TPI, which shifted closer to each other. As a result, the mechanical properties of PEEK/TPI blends were significantly improved with the addition of the PEEK-b-PI. In particular, 5 wt% content of PEEK-b-PI can increase the elongation at break of the blend by about 200%. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A novel liquid-crystalline copolymer of poly(aryl ether ketone) containing fluorine and biphenyl structure (FPEDEKKLCP) was used to decrease the melt viscosity of BF/PEEK composites. The BF/PEEK/FPEDEKKLCP samples were characterized by screw torque measurements, tensile/flexural property evaluation, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The results showed that even a small amount of FPEDEKKLCP could decrease the melt viscosity of the composites during processing, improve the dispersion uniformity and orientation of BF in the PEEK matrix, and increase the flexural modulus, tensile strength, and flexural strength of the BF/PEEK composites. However, the thermal stability of the BF/PEEK composites was almost unaffected by the addition of FPEDEKKLCP. © The Author(s) 2013.

84895199693	Prediction of mechanical properties of polypropylene/WGRT composites via uniform design and artificial neural networks	Recycling represents a valid alternative to the disposal of post-consumer materials if it is possible to obtain new materials with good properties. In this chapter, Polypropylene (PP)/waste ground rubber tire powder (WGRT) or waste polypropylene (WPP)/waste ground rubber tire (WGRT) powder composites were studied with respect to the effect of bitumen and maleic anhydride-grafted styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS-g-MA) content by using the design of experiments (DOE) approach, whereby the effect of the four polymers content on the final mechanical properties were predicted. Uniform design method was especially adopted for its advantages. Optimization was done using hybrid artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA) technique. The results indicated that the composites showed fairly good ductibility provided that it had a relatively higher concentration of bitumen and SEBS-g-MA under the studied condition. A quantitative relationship was presented between the material concentration and the mechanical properties as a set of contour plots, which were confirmed experimentally by testing the optimum ratio. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84907141446	Multi-walled carbon nanotube induced co-continuity of poly(ether ether ketone)/polyimide blends for high performance conductive materials	A high performance conductive material with excellent mechanical and thermal properties was prepared by melt-blending, and its performance was adjusted by controlling the selective location of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in a poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK)/thermoplastic polyimide (TPI) matrix. With increasing content of MWCNTs, the morphology of the PEEK/TPI blends was changed from typical sea-island morphology to a co-continuous structure, which was due to the selective location of MWCNTs in the TPI phase. Notably, the electrical percolation threshold was reduced to as low as 0.6 wt% due to the selective distribution of MWCNTs in the induced co-continuous PEEK/TPI structure, which is the lowest value reported for PEEK-based MWCNTs composites. Moreover, the introduction of MWCNTs could improve the dynamic mechanical properties and thermal stability of the PEEK/TPI blend effectively. This journal is

The molecular structure, the number-average molecular weight and the thermal properties of HPAEK-block-PEG were confirmed and characterized using proton nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The microspheres of HPAEK-block-PEG were fabricated by the method of self-assembly, and the morphology and diameter of the obtained microspheres were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering. The heat-treated experimental results demonstrated that the polymer microspheres possessed excellent thermal property that could stably exist even if heated at 130°C for 10 h. In addition, the diameter of the microspheres can be easily controlled by just adjusting the concentration of the copolymer.
