16244418392	Comparison of nano-indentation hardness to microhardness	With a nano-indenter and a microhardness testing machine, nano-indentation hardness and microhardness are measured in a wide load range (0.1-19600 mN) for five materials. Even fused silica and silicon almost have constant hardness during the load range, the nano-indentation hardness of copper, stainless steel and nickel titanium alloy shows obvious indentation size effect, namely that the hardness decreases with the increase of depth. For the measured materials, the nano-indentation hardness is about 10-30% in magnitude larger than the microhardness. The main reasons can be explained as the analysis of the nano-indentation hardness using the projected contact area at peak load A

0030180499	Monitoring the transition of lubrication status of O/W emulsion with electric resistance technique	An improved resistance technique was used to obtain the time ratio of the metal-to-metal contact under the mixed lubrication regime for a sliding friction system, which can be used to monitor the transition of lubrication status with O/W emulsion. The influences of concentration and load on the capability of film formation of emulsion were experimentally studied. The results show that the transition of lubrication status can be monitored and the corresponding critical transition velocity can be detected by measuring the time ratio of metal contact. Besides, the emulsion can form an oil-pool in line contact region where the oil concentration is much higher than its bulk nominal value, and the emulsion lubrication has some characteristics of oil-pool lubrication.

0032259121	Design of self-adaptive micro-tribology multiple-measuring test rig and experimental studies on nano-lubrication	The basic principle and design of the self-adaptive micro-tribology multiple-measuring test rig have been described. In the rig, by adopting the widely used self-adaptive floating contact system, precise loading by a lever and precise friction force measuring system, the friction force in milli-Newton scale can be obtained and the tribology characteristics of nano-films in the different contact statues are studied. By using relative optical intensity technology, the film thickness in nanometer scale is measured simultaneously. The lubrication characteristics of the 10th standard liquid of viscosity have been investigated with the test rig. The variant trends of friction coefficients and film thickness with load, sliding velocity and lubrication ways (pure sliding in surface contact, pure rolling and pure sliding in point contact) have been studied. The experiments show that the test rig meets the design requirements.

23844514795	Fretting wear behavior of superelastic nickel titanium shape memory alloy	The fretting behavior of superelastic nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy was studied at various displacement amplitudes on a serve-hydraulic dynamic test machine. The results showed that the superelastic properties of the material played a key role in the observed excellent fretting behavior of NiTi alloy. Due to the low phase transition stress (only 1/4 the value of its plastic yield stress) and the large recoverable phase transition strain (5%) of NiTi, the friction force of NiTi/GCr15 stainless steel pair is smaller than the value of GCr15/GCr15 pair and at the same time the Rabinowicz wear coefficient of NiTi plate is about 1/9 the value of GCr15 plate under the same fretting conditions. For NiTi/GCr15 pair, even NiTi has a much lower hardness than GCr15, the superelastic NiTi alloy exhibits superior fretting wear property than GCr15 steel. It was found that the weak ploughing was the main wear mechanism of NiTi alloy in the partial slip regime. While in the mixed regime and gross slip regime, the wear of NiTi was mainly caused by the abrasive wear of the GCr15 debris in the three-body wear mode. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

We found that there exist two characteristic points, the bifurcating point and the returning point, in an indentation curve. The corresponding bifurcation force and return force, respectively, rely on the forward transformation stress and the reverse transformation stress. A method to determine the transformation stresses of SMA from the measure of the bifurcation and return forces is proposed. Additionally, we suggest a slope approach to determine the values of the two forces with high accuracy. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33750688846	Analysis of spherical indentation of superelastic shape memory alloys	Dimensional analysis and the finite element method are applied in this paper to study spherical indentation of superelastic shape memory alloys. The scaling relationships derived from dimensional analysis bridge the indentation response and the mechanical properties of a superelastic shape memory alloy. Several key variables of a superelastic indentation curve are revealed and examined. We prove that the bifurcation force in a superelastic indentation curve only relies on the forward transformation stress and the elastic properties of the initial austenite; and the return force in a superelastic indentation curve only relies on the reverse transformation stress and the elastic properties of the initial austenite. Furthermore, the dimensionless functions to determine the bifurcation force and the return force are proved to be identical. These results not only enhance our understanding of spherical indentation of superelastic shape memory alloys, but also provide the theoretical basis for developing a practicable method to calibrate the mechanical properties of a superelastic material from the spherical indentation test. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

34748887261	Nanofretting behaviors of NiTi shape memory alloy	Nanofretting refers to cyclic movements of contact interfaces with the relative displacement amplitude at the nanometer scale, where the contact area and normal load are usually much smaller than those in fretting. Nanofretting widely exists in microelctromechanical systems (MEMS) and may become a key tribological concern besides microwear and adhesion. With a triboindenter, the nanofretting behaviors of a nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy are studied under various normal loads (1-10 mN) and tangential displacement amplitudes (2-500 nm) by using a spherical diamond tip. Similar to fretting, the nanofretting of NiTi/diamond pair can also be divided into different regimes upon various shapes of tangential force-displacement curves. The dependence of nanofretting regime on the normal load and the displacement amplitude can be summarized in a running condition nanofretting map. However, due to the surface and size effects, nanofretting operates at some different conditions, such as improved mechanical properties of materials at the nanometer scale, small apparent contact area and single-asperity contact behavior. Consequently, different from fretting, nanofretting was found to exhibit several unique behaviors: (i) the maximum tangential force in one cycle is almost unchanged during a nanofretting test, which is different from a fretting test where the maximum tangential force increases rapidly in the first dozens of cycles; (ii) the tangential stiffness in nanofretting is three orders magnitude smaller than that in fretting; (iii) the friction coefficient in nanofretting is much lower than that in fretting in slip regime; (iv) no obvious damage was observed after 50 cycles of nanofretting under a normal load of 10 mN. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

35949002047	An improved calibration method for friction force in atomic force microscopy	Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become one of the most important device to perform experimental studies on nanotribology. To obtain quantitative friction force, it is needed to calibrate the force in AFM. The experimental results indicated that the load exhibited a strong effect on the calibration by the traditional wedge calibration method. The calibration factor α obtained at various load could be different from each other by one order in magnitude. The effective calibration factor can even not be obtained at very low load. The reason may be related to the failure of the assumption of the wedge calibration method, since the method assumed that the friction coefficient is independent on the variation of the normal force during the calibration process. In fact, the assumption is only effective at high load. At low load, the assumption is failure since the interfacial friction is not proportional to the load, which in turn induces the large error in the calibration process. Therefore, an improved wedge calibration method was proposed in this paper. Based on the traditional wedge calibration method, the calibration factors α corresponding to various loads were obtained by experiments. From the calibration factor versus load curve, the final calibration factor α was then determined as the relatively stable value of α at high load. Since the improved wedge calibration method investigated the variation of the calibration factors with loads, the calibration result is more reasonable than the traditional one.

36049033183	Temperature effect on the friction behavior of NiTi shape memory alloy	By using an atomic force microscopy, the friction behavior of a NiTi shape memory alloy is investigated under various temperatures in vacuum environment. Under wearless condition at low loads, the adhesion-dominated friction of NiTi is almost temperature independent. However, while scratch mark appears after friction at high loads, the plough-dominated friction force is found to decrease with the increaase in temperature. Based on a simple contact analysis, the temperature dependent friction behavior of NiTi at high loads may be mainly attributed to the thermoelastic phase transition in NiTi. While temperature increases from 26-100°C, the tensile phase transition stress of NiTi increases from 412-964 MPa, which induces -27% magnitude decrease in the contact area between the diamond tip and NiTi. It further results in the decrease in the plough-dominated friction force on NiTi.

0033238198	The failure of fluid film at nano-scale	The determination of hydrodynamic film failure has become one of the key aspects in the study of thin film lubrication (TFL) since the hydrodynamic effect of fluid film at nano-scale can be observed with recently developed experimental techniques. In the present paper, the relative optical interference intensity (ROII) technique with a resolution of 0.5 run in the vertical direction has been used to measure the film thickness. Experimental results show that the hydrodynamic effect can be clearly observed even at very low speed if the contact pressure is sufficiently low or if the viscosity of lubricant is comparatively high. When the pressure increases to a certain degree, the film will suddenly drop to the dimension of several layers of molecules and this is where the failure of the fluid film has taken place. For different viscosity of lubricants, the fluid film failure occurs at different rolling speeds and pressures. In addition, when the normal load becomes higher, a higher speed or larger viscosity is required to form the fluid film in the contact region. Finally, the effects of pressure, viscosity, and velocity on the occurrence of fluid film failure have been examined and a relationship involving the three parameters is proposed.

The effect of relative humidity and load on the modification was also tested. The experimental results showed that the modification process was not gradually but quickly occurred during the first several friction scans and that the tip condition reached steady state in the following 10-20 friction scans. The tips modified on the surface of OTE/mica had lower friction and adhesion on the mica surface than the unmodified tips. Most of the adsorbed molecules on the tip surface were cleaned within the first ten friction scans on the mica surface. The tip modification was little dependent on the humidity. But greatly on the load. Therefore, clean tips should be used to study the tribological properties of different samples, and samples, with stable tribological properties e.g. mica should be used to investigate the state of the tip surface.

39049130305	Effect of ceramic conversion treatments on the surface damage and nickel ion release of NiTi alloys under fretting corrosion conditions	Recent researches have demonstrated that surface modification can improve the fretting wear resistance of NiTi alloys in air or enhance their aqueous corrosion resistance without fretting. However, little is known about the behaviour of surface engineered NiTi under fretting corrosion conditions. This is important for such body implants as orthodontic arch wires and orthopedic bone fixation devices because they need to withstand the combined attack of corrosion from body fluid and mechanical fretting. In this study, a NiTi alloy was ceramic conversion (CC) treated at 400 and 650°C. The effect of the surface treatment on the fretting corrosion behaviour of NiTi alloy was investigated using fretting corrosion tests in the Ringer's solution.

32244433863	Role of phase transition in the unusual microwear behavior of superelastic NiTi shape memory alloy	The excellent microwear performance of nano-grained superelastic nickel titanium (NiTi) polycrystalline shape memory alloy (SMA) is reported in this paper. The microwear test was conducted at temperatures ranging from 22 to 120 °C by a Hysitron triboindenter. The results showed that the NiTi SMA has superior microwear resistance compared to traditional tribo-materials such as stainless steel AISI 304 and that the material exhibits unusual hardness dependence of wear within certain temperature regimes. With the increase in temperature from 22 to 120 °C, wear resistance was found to decrease anomalously with an increase in hardness. Further investigation and analysis confirmed that the stress-induced phase transition during contact and wear play an essential role in the material's high wear resistance. It is demonstrated through contact mechanics analysis that the increase of hardness with temperature was mainly due to the increase in the phase transition stress. The observed applied threshold load that corresponds to the onset of the plastic deformation in the contact area was strongly influenced by the phase transition process at the tip region. For the investigated superelastic NiTi, the temperature-dependent interplay between reversible phase transition and irreversible plastic yielding plays a key role in the temperature dependence of the wear performance and is responsible for the observed apparent unusual hardness-wear relationships. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

33644959355	Radial nanofretting of single crystal copper and silicon under high load	As a new tribological movement mode, nanofretting refers to a cyclic movement of contact interfaces with the relative displacement amplitude in nanometer scale. Since it widely exists in microelctromechanical systems (MEMS), nanofretting damage may become a key tribological problem besides microwear and adhesion. Using a nanoindenter, the radial nanofretting behaviors of single crystal copper and Si(110) were studied under various peak indentation forces. It was found that the residual deformation depth decreased quickly with the increase in the number of nanofretting cycles. The indentation curves of copper and silicon exhibited a hysteresis loop especially in the initial nanofretting cycles, which indicated an energy dissipative process in nanofretting. The energy dissipation in nanofretting may be attributed to the friction between diamond indenter and sample, the plastic deformation of sample, as well as the stress-induced phase transition process in nanofretting. The energy dissipation was the highest in the first cycle and then decreased dramatically to a constant after 20 cycles. Both the contact stiffness and elastic modulus increased sharply in the first several cycles and attained constants thereafter. Even the projected area of the indents in copper and silicon showed an increase with the increase in the number of nanofretting cycles, the radial nanofretting damage exhibited their unique behaviors. The radial nanofretting damage in copper was mainly identified as the pileup of the wrinkles around indents. Whereas, the radial nanofretting damage in silicon was characterized as the initiation and propagation of the cracks on the edges of plastic zone.

41349086413	Wearless scratch on NiTi shape memory alloy due to phase transformational shakedown	Cyclic microscratch tests were performed to examine the scratching behavior of NiTi shape memory alloy. It shows a superior wear resistance within the temperature range of 22-120 °C, but the corresponding physical mechanisms are different at low and high temperatures. We introduced the concept of phase transformational shakedown to interpret the wear-resistant behavior. At room temperature, a scratch groove may be caused by repeated scratching, but its depth stops increasing after a certain number of scratching cycles once the phase transformational shakedown state has been achieved. The groove will be self-healed upon heating as a result of the shape memory effect. At 60 and 120 °C, however, no evident scratch groove is observed under the same load due to the pseudoelastic effect and the increase in the phase transition stress with temperature. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

The tribological profiles were clarified at low amplitude oscillatory motion as potential orthopedic implants. The inoculation of HA nanoparticles into fibrous composites lowered the coefficients of friction (COFs) and wear rates, and the hardness of HA layers and rolling effect of HA particles further improved the wear resistance. The COFs and wear rates were significantly lower when fretting along the fiber orientation than those when the slide direction was perpendicular to the fiber alignment. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84867042175	Preliminary study on tribological behavior and self-repairing mechanism of keratin tissues	The tribological behaviors and deformation recovery of fingernails and chicken claws are preliminarily investigated using nano-indentation/scratch tester and Vickers hardness instrument. Experimental results indicate that the tribological properties of keratin tissues strongly depend on their microstructures. Because of the better fiber orientation, the friction coefficient on fingernail is a little lower than that on chicken claws at the same loading conditions. On the cross section of nail, even though the friction coefficient during scratching in the direction perpendicular to fibers is greater than that parallel to fibers, the scratch width is smaller. Moreover, due to the different structures and properties between the inner and outer of claw, the latter presents higher friction coefficient and smaller scratch width. Finally, both the indentation and scratch deformation of nail and claw under low load can be fully recovered after being immersed in water for 5 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively.

51349135094	Experimental study of the transformation ratcheting of superelastic NiTi alloy	Under stressing-controlled cyclic loading, the cyclic accumulation of peak strain and valley strain, denoted as transformation ratcheting, takes place in superelastic NiTi alloy obviously. The transformation ratcheting behavior of superelastic NiTi alloy and its dependence upon load condition were studied by experiments at room temperature. It is shown that the alloy presents apparent transformation ratcheting, and the value of transformation ratcheting strain and its evolution rule depend greatly upon the applied stress amplitude, mean stress and loading charts; in the meantime, the nominal elastic modulus of austenite, nominal starting stress for the transformation from austenite to martensite and dissipation energy decrease, while nominal elastic modulus of martensite increases with the increase in the number of cycles, and then reach a steady state after certain cycles. Some significant conclusions are obtained, which are useful to establish a constitutive model describing the transformation ratcheting of the material.

56549092143	Ratchetting deformation of super-elastic and shape-memory NiTi alloys	The ratchetting deformation of super-elastic NiTi alloy was first observed by uniaxial stress-controlled cyclic tests, and the dependence of ratchetting upon the applied stress and loading type was discussed. The evolutions of responded peak/valley strain, nominal elastic modulus and transformation stress, as well as dissipation energy of the alloy during the stress-controlled cyclic loading were investigated. It is shown that the super-elastic NiTi alloy presents significant "transformation ratchetting" which is mainly caused by the cyclic accumulation of remained martensite due to the incomplete reverse transformation from the stress-induced martensite to original austenite, and the transformation ratchetting and its evolution depend greatly upon the applied stress amplitude, mean stress and loading chart. For comparison, the ratchetting deformation of shape-memory NiTi alloy and its dependence upon the loading condition were also observed. It is seen that the ratchetting deformation of shape-memory NiTi alloy under the stress-controlled cyclic loading differs greatly from that of super-elastic NiTi alloy, since no reversible transformation from the austenite to the stress-induced martensite occurs in the shape-memory NiTi alloy during the stress-controlled cyclic loading at room temperature. It means that no transformation ratchetting occurs in the shape-memory NiTi alloy, and the ratchetting deformation of the alloy occurred during the asymmetrical stress-controlled cyclic loading is mainly caused by the cyclic accumulation of visco-plastic deformation of re-oriented martensite, which is similar to the ratchetting deformation of ordinary metals. For both the super-elastic and shape-memory NiTi alloys, a nearly stable stress-strain response with small dissipation energy occurs after certain cycles. Some significant conclusions are obtained, which are useful to establish a constitutive model describing the ratchetting deformation of the NiTi alloys. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The morphology of scratch scars was showed via a field emission scanning electron microscope and an AMBIOS XP-2 stylus profilometer. The results indicated that the wear resistance of axial section was better than that of cross section. Furthermore, the wear resistance of axial section was affected by the different arrangement of lamellae. The wear degree was slighter when the scratches were conducted along the direction paralleling the osteon. The wear mechanism of cortical bone became more complicated with the increasing loads. It changed from the simple elastic-plastic deformation to the combination of deformation, delamination, and microcrack's propagation. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

57849113582	The role of martensite reorientation in the fretting behaviour of nickel titanium shape memory alloy	In this study, fretting tests of a GCr15 steel ball against a nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy plate (NiTi/GCr15) are performed on a horizontal servo-hydraulic fretting machine. It is found that the martensite reorientation plays an important role in the fretting behaviour of NiTi. Similar to that in a cyclic torsion test, the shear-induced martensite reorientation deformation of NiTi is reversible in tangential fretting, where the material undergoes a cyclic shear process. With an increase in the number of fretting cycles, the additional tangential displacement due to the martensite reorientation deformation in NiTi reaches its peak value at about 50-100 cycles after the initial increase, and finally decreases to a constant value after 1000 cycles. As a result, the martensite reorientation in fretting increases the elastic-accommodation ability of NiTi/GCr15 pairs, and further expands the partial slip regime of NiTi/GCr15 pairs. In addition, similar to the martensite phase transition in NiTi, the martensite reorientation in NiTi exhibits a strong shielding effect to decrease the contact stress of NiTi/GCr15 pairs and improve the wear resistance of NiTi. © IMechE 2008.

Different from fretting, the nanofretting damage of silicon may successively experience two progresses, the generation of hillocks and grooves, with the increase in normal load. The critical contact pressure corresponding to the transition of the damage mode was found to be close to the hardness of Si(1 0 0). Due to the absence of water and oxygen in vacuum, the tangential force in nanofretting was a little lower than that in atmosphere. Compared to those in atmosphere, the nanofretting scars in vacuum exhibited higher hillock at low load but shallower groove at high load, which could be explained as the "soft coating" effect of oxide layer on Si(1 0 0) surface.

65749111306	Wear behavior of early carious enamel before and after remineralization	The purpose of the research was to evaluate the effect of remineralization treatment on the wear behavior of human early carious enamel. The degree of remineralization was observed with polarized light microscope and microhardness tester. Then the tribological properties of all the specimens were investigated by a CSEM nano-stratch tester system. The results showed that the hardness and density of carious enamel increased obviously, and the friction coefficient became higher after remineralization. It was easier to form cracks and debris on the remineralized enamel. It was concluded that the most effective remineralization agent (fluoride) in clinic could decrease the wear resistance of early carious enamel. There was no direct relationship between the content of minerals and the wear resistance of early carious enamel. The wear resistance of enamel could not be improved veritably by increasing the hardness. The main damage mechanisms of early carious enamel were the plastic deformation and adhesive wear while those of remineralized one were the combination of brittle cracks, plastic deformation and brittle delamination. New technique of remineralization is urgently needed clinically to improve the wear resistance. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using an atomic force microscopy, the films were found to reveal smaller adhesion and friction forces in vacuum than in atmosphere. Due to the effect of the adsorbed water layer on the samples, the more hydrophilic film exhibited the larger difference between the friction forces in vacuum and in atmosphere. For the dual-layer films either in atmosphere or in vacuum, the densely packed long chains can lead to lower friction than the poor-packed short chains, and the tail phenyl groups may induce higher friction than the methyl groups. In the initial stage of nanowear process by a diamond tip, a series of hillocks were observed on silicon surface along the scratching line. It was found that all the films can effectively enhance the antiwear ability of silicon surface and the self-assembled dual-layer film terminated by long chains (STA/APS) or -C

67649823446	Radial nanofretting behavior of four typical structural materials in MEMS under high loads	Nanofretting refers to a cyclic movement of contact surfaces with the relative displacement amplitude in nanometer scale, where the contact area and normal load are usually much smaller than those in fretting. To understand the radial nanofretting behaviors under high loads, the nanofretting tests of a Berkovich diamond tip against typical structural materials in MEMS (polycrystalline copper, monocrystal silicon, and nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloys) were performed with a nanoindenter. The experimental results indicate that: (i) the residual deformation depth in a nanofretting cycle quickly decreases to zero with the increase in the number of cycles; (ii) both the contact stiffness and the projected area of the indents on four materials attain to constants after the initial increase; (iii) the force vs. displacement curve exhibits a hysteresis loop due to the energy dissipation in nanofretting cycle. The energy can be dissipated in nanofretting by different ways corresponding to various materials, such as plastic deformation, interface friction, as well as the stress-induced phase transition. Under high loads, the main nanofretting damage of materials is plastic deformation, which may be almost finished during the first several cycles. Besides plastic deformation, the typical nanofretting damage in copper is identified as the pileup of the wrinkles on the edge of indents. In silicon, the damage is characterized as the initiation and propagation of the cracks on the edge of plastic zone of indents. Due to the stress-induced reversible phase transition, the superelastic NiTi could exhibit a good damping property under the complex loading condition, and therefore shows the excellent ability against nanofretting damage in four materials. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface microhardness, structure and chemical composition of enamel were examined by means of Vickers microhardness tester, profilometry, SEM and EDX. The results showed that no obvious erosive lesion occurred on the surface of enamel after 1 min. Erosive lesion on the surface of enamel was found after 3 min accompanied by the reductions of the surface microhardness and the content of calcium and phosphate ions. The erosive lesion of enamel aggravated as the time of erosion increased. SEM micrographs of human tooth enamel showed that the erosion of enamel rods occurred before the erosion of inter-rod enamel. The loss of enamel rods could accelerate the erosion of the surrounding inter-rod enamel, and finally caused substantial erosive loss of human tooth enamel.

Forty natural human premolar specimens with early caries lesions were prepared. A remineralization pH-cycling treatment agent of 4000 ppm gallic acid was used for 12 days to treat the early lesions. The changes in microhardness were monitored. Nanoscratch tests were used to evaluate wear resistance. The experimental data were analyzed by using a t-test. The widths of traces were measured by an AMBIOS XP-2 stylus profilometer. After remineralization, all samples re-hardened significantly. The coefficients of friction became higher, and the widths of scratches were larger than they were before remineralization. Gallic acid significantly improved the early carious enamel's hardness. The wear damage of the samples treated with gallic acid was more severe than that of the control group. There were more obvious cracks and delaminations on the traces of the treated group. Compared with the control group, the enamel remineralized with gallic acid had inferior wear resistance. After remineralization, the dominant damage mechanisms of early carious enamel had changed from plastic deformation and adhesive wear to a combination of brittle cracks and delamination of enamel. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Three kinds of surface treatments were used in the experiments, namely low-temperature plasma nitriding at 430°C, carbonitriding at 430°C, and carburising at 500°C, respectively. The experimental results indicated that all the three treatments created a layer of ″S″ phase on the sample surface, which effectively improved the hardness and elastic modulus of 316LVM and further enhanced its anti-corrosion and anti-wear properties. The 316LVM nitrided at 430°C showed the similar friction behavior as that carbonitrided at 430°C. Even the 316LVM carburised at 500°C exhibited the lowest friction coefficient; the low-temperature plasma carbonitrided at 430°C was the best surface treatment of three against the fretting wear of medical grade 316LVM austenitic stainless steels in this experiment.

70350686490	Friction-induced nanofabrication on monocrystalline silicon	Fabrication of nanostructures has become a major concern as the scaling of device dimensions continues. In this paper, a friction-induced nanofabrication method is proposed to fabricate protrusive nanostructures on silicon. Without applying any voltage, the nanofabrication is completed by sliding an AFM diamond tip on a sample surface under a given normal load. Nanostructured patterns, such as linear nanostructures, nanodots or nanowords, can be fabricated on the target surface. The height of these nanostructures increases rapidly at first and then levels off with the increasing normal load or number of scratching cycles. TEM analyses suggest that the friction-induced hillock is composed of silicon oxide, amorphous silicon and deformed silicon structures. Compared to the tribochemical reaction, the amorphization and crystal defects induced by the mechanical interaction may have played a dominating role in the formation of the hillocks. Similar to other proximal probe methods, the proposed method enables fabrication at specified locations and facilitates measuring the dimensions of nanostructures with high precision. It is highlighted that the fabrication can also be realized on electrical insulators or oxide surfaces, such as quartz and glass. Therefore, the friction-induced method points out a new route in fabricating nanostructures on demand. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

72049110838	Erosion behavior of human tooth enamel in citric acid solution	In vitro erosion behavior of human tooth enamel in citric acid solution (pH=3.2) has been investigated. The surfaces of enamel after different erosion times were analyzed by means of various microscopic examinations. Results showed that no obvious substance loss occurred on the enamel surface at the early stage of erosion, and the erosive lesion was characterized mainly by partial demineralization and decreased microhardness. As the erosion time increased, a honeycomb-like structure appeared on the enamel surface as a result of severe dissolution of the enamel rods. Then substantial erosive substance loss happened. The loss increased almost linearly with the erosion time. Further friction-wear tests by a nano-scratch tester indicated that the erosion of enamel had significant influence on its friction and wear behaviors. Both the friction coefficient and wear loss of eroded enamel showed a strong dependence on erosion time. Understanding of dental erosion behavior would be useful for improving clinical management of tooth wear. © 2009.

75349114708	Load effect on the translation of friction mechanism of four materials	By using a diamond tip of 2 μm in curvature radius, the tribological properties of GCr15, 304 stainless, superelastic and shape memory effect NiTi alloys were investigated under 5 μN~80 mN with an atomic force microscopy and nano-scratch tester, respectively. The results indicate that the load exhibits a strong effect on the friction mechanism of materials. When the load is below 80 μN, no obvious damage is observed on four samples and the interfacial friction should be dominated. While the load increases to 100~150 μN, the plough friction becomes dominated. As the load attains 80 mN, more than 90% of the friction force is induced by plough. Also, the hardness and elastic modulus of materials reveal a significant effect on their friction behaviors. The higher the hardness of material, the more difficult to be ploughed the material, and the larger the translation load between interfacial friction and plough friction. In addition, when the material has higher ratio of elastic modulus to hardness, the plough should be more dominant during the scratch process.

77649237973	Friction-induced hillocks on monocrystalline silicon in atmosphere and in vacuum	Using an atomic force microscope, the friction-induced hillocks of 0.5-7.1 nm in height were observed on Si(1 0 0) surface under both atmosphere and vacuum conditions. Larger hillocks can be produced by either higher loads or more scratch cycles. Detailed surface analyses on the hillocks revealed that the thickness of oxidation layer formed during scratching was 1.2 nm in vacuum and 1.5 nm in atmosphere, which was much smaller than the height (3.5 nm) of the detected hillocks. Further analysis indicated that oxidation in scratching only led to very small increase in height, i.e. <23% of the total height of the detected hillocks. TEM observations demonstrated that the hillocks are largely amorphous structured. Therefore, the generation of friction-induced hillocks was the coupled results of oxidation reaction and mechanical interaction; the mechanical interaction, which might be most likely through the shear deformation of amorphous superficial layer in silicon, should play a dominant role. These findings will shed new light on the subtle mechanism of nanowear and provide possibilities for preventing the wear failure of MEMS/NEMS. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the proposed model, transformation hardening, reverse transformation, elastic mismatch between the austenite and martensite phases, and temperature-dependence of elastic modulus for each phase are considered. In the meantime, the plastic yielding of austenite or martensite occurred at high temperature or under high stress is also addressed.

77949887287	Formation of hillock-scratch damage on Si(100) surface under low load	Using a spherical diamond tip of 3 μm in radius and nano-scratch instrument, the scratch tests were carried out on Si(100) surface under various loads. It was found that with the increase in the load, the scratch damage on Si(100) surface would experience the following three stages: formation of surface hillock, generation of hillock and groove, and removal of material. While the load varied between 0.5 and 3 mN, the scratch-induced damage was identified as the formation of hillock. As the load increased from 3 to 50 mN, the scratch could lead to the generation of groove. However, the surface hillock kept growing and the hillock still dominated the scratch process. When the normal load attained 50 mN, the depth of the scratched groove increased rapidly and materials removal began to govern the scratch process. Further investigation revealed that the scratch-induced damage of Si(100) was associated with the contact stress between the diamond tip and Si(100) surface. The formation of silicon hillock could be mainly attributed to the mechanical interaction by scratching under ultra low load.

Erosion time of 3 min was used. The microtribological behaviors of eroded surfaces were also examined using nanoscratch technique. Results showed that erosion properties of enamel were closely associated with its location. Erosive substance loss increased from the outer to the interior enamel. Additionally, compared with the outer enamel, the influence of erosion on subsequent friction and wear behaviors appeared more significant in the interior enamel.

77953682791	Effect of water on the mechanical and frictional behaviors of human fingernails	The fingernails are generally used for a variety of functions including protecting, foraging, and gripping. The achievement of these functions depends on the mechanical properties of fingernails. In this article, the deformation recovery of human fingernails in water was investigated. The effect of water on the mechanical and frictional behaviors of fingernails was studied using a nano indentation and scratch tester. Owing to the swelling of fingernail matrix, the indents under a peak indentation load of 20 N and scratches under a constant load of 70 mN can be fully recovered after the fingernail samples were dipped in water for 10 min. The recovery of these deformations in water reveals obvious anisotropy on the different sections of fingernails. The recovery speed of the indents and scratches on the surface of fingernails is the fastest, and the slowest recovery happens for the deformations on the longitudinal section. With the water in hydrated fingernails evaporating in air, the microhardness of fingernails shows a quick increase in the first 100 min and levels off after 200 min. Finally, the microhardness of fingernails in the fully dehydrated state is 2-3 times larger than that in the hydrated state. The water in fingernails reduces the fluctuation of friction force on surface and protects the surface of fingernails from scratch damage. Owing to the special orientation of filament in the intermediate layer of fingernails, the friction on the cross section of fingernail shows an anisotropic behavior. Either on the dehydrated or hydrated fingernails, the friction coefficient along the parallel direction of filament is lower than that along the vertical direction of filament. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77953827369	Effect of curvature radius of indenter on the radial nanofretting damage of monocrystal silicon	A nanoindenter is adopted to study the radial nanofretting behaviors of diamond indenters of different curvature radii on the monocrystal silicon surface and the damage characteristic. It is found that compared to the tip nominal curvature radius, the equivalent curvature radius of indenter at a certain identation depth plays a much more important role in the nanofretting damage of material. Under a peak indentation load of 50 mN, no obvious damage is observed on Si<100> after 200 nanofretting cycles by 20 μm spherical indenter. Even with a relatively smaller curvature radius, 150 nm Berkovich indenter induces the weaker nanofretting damage than 2 μm spherical indenter on Si<100 7>. Analysis indicates that the equivalent half cone angle of Berkovich indenter is 70.32°, which is much larger than that of 2 μm spherical indenter, 42.50°. As the indentation depth is larger than 300 nm, the equivalent curvature radius of Berkovich indenter is larger than that of 2 μm spherical indenter. As a result, the contact area of Berkovich indenter will be larger and nanofretting damage will be weaker. The results also indicate that the contact stiffness of both 2 μm spherical indenter and Berkovich indenter increases sharply in the initial nanofretting cycles, which induces an obvious work-hardening process of material. However, no work-hardening process is found during the nanofretting by 20 μm spherical indenter. ©2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

77953420056	Nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviours of human tooth enamel	Nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviours of human tooth enamel have been investigated using the nanoindentation and nanoscratch techniques. Nanoscratch tests were conducted along different directions in the occlusal and axial sections of enamel under different normal loads. The results showed that for a single enamel rod, the hardness and Young's modulus were higher in the central head area and tended to be lower in the edge area, especially in the tail area. In the occlusal section, the enamel presented higher wear resistance at low loads owing to the compact alternate arrangement of mineral and organic phases within the enamel and the heterogeneous mechanical properties of enamel rods. No obvious material removal occurred, and the surface lesion of enamel was characterized mainly by plastic deformation. As the load increased, significant material removal occurred as a result of brittle delamination, and the coefficient of friction increased and fluctuated. The wear resistance of the axial section was inferior to that of the occlusal section, and moreover, the enamel demonstrated anisotropic microtribological properties in the axial section. Both the friction coefficient and wear loss were higher when the scratches were conducted along the direction of enamel rods.

77953422385	Nanoscratch resistance of human tooth enamel treated by Nd: YAG laser irradiation	The purpose of this study was to investigate the friction behaviour of human tooth enamel irradiated by Nd:YAG laser. Forty specimens were randomly divided into four groups, and received the Nd:YAG laser irradiation with different energy densities (without irradiation; 20, 40, and 80 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Subsequently, nano-scratch tests were conducted on the treated enamel surfaces, with progressive loads from 0.1 to 80 mN. The morphologies of the treated enamel surfaces and the scratch scars were observed via a field emission scanning electron microscope and an AMBIOS XP-2 stylus profilometer. The results indicated that the Nd:YAG laser promoted slight morphological alterations under a lower energy density (20 J/cm<sup>2</ sup>), but different morphologies occurred under a higher energy density (40 and 80 J/cm<sup>2</sup>). The irradiated enamel surfaces had inferior nano-scratch resistance, and the nano-scratch resistance decreased as the energy density increased. Nd:YAG laser irradiation decreased the nano-scratch resistance of the enamel. The main damage mechanisms of the irradiated enamel under nano-scratch consisted of brittle delaminations and formation of cracks.

Anodic polarization tests demonstrated that the precipitate-free S-phase generated by low-temperature plasma carburising at 500 °C for 15 h can retain the good corrosion resistance of the untreated ASTM F2581 Ni-Free material in Ringer's solution. The wear resistance of the Ni-free austenitic stainless steel can be improved by 700% and 140% when reciprocating against a WC ball in air (dry-wear) and in Ringer's solution (corrosion-wear) respectively. In addition, the low-temperature plasma carburising treatment can considerably reduce the friction coefficient and improve the fretting-wear resistance of the Ni-free austenitic stainless steel in Ringer's solution. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

78649233608	Super-elastic constitutive model considering plasticity and its finite element implementation	Based on the experimental results of super-elastic NiTi alloy, a three-dimensional super-elastic constitutive model including both of stress-induced martensite transformation and plasticity is constructed in a framework of general inelasticity. In the proposed model, transformation hardening, reverse transformation of stress-induced martensite, elastic mismatch between the austenite and martensite phases, and temperature-dependence of transformation stress and elastic modulus of each phase are considered. The plastic yielding of martensite occurred under high stress is addressed by a bilinear isotropic hardening rule. Drucker-Prager-typed transformation surfaces are employed to describe the asymmetric behavior of NiTi alloy in tension and compression. The prediction capability of the proposed model is verified by comparing the simulated results with the correspondent experimental ones. Based on backward Euler's integration, a new expression of consistent tangent modulus is derived. The proposed model is then implemented into a finite element package ABAQUS by user-subroutine UMAT. Finally, the validity of such implementation was verified by some numerical samples.

79955949074	Friction and wear behaviors of human tooth enamel in citric acid solution	By using a reciprocating sliding wear test machine, friction and wear behaviors of human tooth enamel opposite to titanium alloy have been investigated in citric acid solution (pH=3.2). The results showed that human tooth enamel exhibited different tribological behaviors in two different media, i.e. citric acid solution and artificial saliva. Due to the enamel surface softening and demineralization caused by acid-attack, the friction coefficient was lower and fluctuated more significantly in citric acid solution than in artificial saliva. The worn surface was characterized mainly by adhesive delamination. Wear volume almost increased linearly with the number of cycles in citric acid solution, which was bigger than that in artificial saliva.

79960659519	Analysis of squeaking on ceramic hip endoprosthesis using the complex eigenvalue method	A finite element model of the ceramic hip endoprosthesis system is established with ABAQUS 6.7. The generation mechanism of squeaking is studied using the complex eigenvalue method which allows for a stability analysis of the system under friction coupling. Numerical results reveal that a ceramic hip endoprosthesis system has a strong propensity of unstable vibration when the friction coefficient of ceramic bearings reaches to a critical value, which is considered to be the most likely mechanism for squeaking. In the present study μ= 0.15 is proved to be a critical value, below which there is no instability of the system. Furthermore, the resonance of the femoral components at a frequency of 3177. Hz is found to be the source of the unstable vibration in squeaking. On the basis of the etiology of squeaking, two methods for suppressing squeaking are proposed. One method is adding ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) damping material in acetabular components, the other is imposing reasonable fixed stiffness on acetabular components. Simulation results show that both methods are effective for increasing the critical friction coefficient from 0.15 to 0.22 and 0.32, respectively, which improve the stability of the ceramic hip endoprosthesis system to a great extent. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960663626	In vitro study on the wear behaviour of human tooth enamel in citric acid solution	With a worldwide increase in the ingestion of acidic soft drinks, the wear of human teeth in acidic oral environment is becoming normal, especially in young people. Previous studies mostly focused on the friction and wear behaviours of human teeth in the artificial saliva, and wear behaviours in acidic environment are still far from being well understood. In this paper, the wear behaviour of human tooth enamel against titanium alloy in 0.001. M citric acid solution (pH 3.20) has been investigated using a reciprocating wear machine. Three normal loads, 10. N, 20. N, and 40. N, were used. Results showed that in the citric acid solution, a honeycomb-like structure appeared on the surface of enamel as a result of severe dissolution of the enamel rods, and the surface hardness decreased. Under a low normal loading level, the surface softening of enamel caused by erosion dissolution played a significant role in its wear behaviour, and the wear mechanism of enamel was dominant by adhesion delamination. Hence, enamel wear in the citric acid solution was significantly higher than in the artificial saliva. With the load increasing, brittle fracture by the loading force aggravated, and obvious flake delamination happened. Enamel wear tended to be characterized mainly by mechanical removal. As a result, both the wear morphology and wear loss of enamel in the citric acid solution were similar to those in the artificial saliva at a high normal load of 40. N. These results indicated that there existed a competitive mechanism between the mechanical action and the chemical action when enamel wear occurred in the citric acid solution. The effect of erosion on the wear behaviour of enamel was more obvious under a low load than under a high load. The results would help extend understanding of the tooth wear process in acidic environment and provide a more rational explanation for the mechanism of tooth wear in the mouth. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960665022	Effect of remineralization on the nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviour of acid-eroded human tooth enamel	Acid-eroded human tooth enamel is more susceptible to abrasion and attrition than intact enamel. Previous studies suggested that remineralization may be a useful way to improve the mechanical properties of acid-eroded enamel. The objective of our study was to investigate the effect of remineralization on the nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviour of acid-eroded human tooth enamel. In this paper, enamel specimens were prepared from human molar teeth. The enamel specimens were first immersed in citric acid solution (pH = 3.20) for 10 min to obtain acid-eroded enamel specimens. Remineralization was conducted in vitro by immersing the acid-eroded enamel specimens in artificial saliva for 12 h. A nano-indentation/scratch tester was used to study the nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviour of the enamel specimens. Results showed that a layer of mineral deposits was formed on the acid-eroded enamel surface after in vitro remineralization. Compared with the original enamel surface, this layer had a similar chemical composition, but a significantly different crystal orientation. The nanomechanical and microtribological properties of the acid-eroded enamel surface were significantly enhanced by remineralization. However, the loss of the hardness and Young's modulus of enamel surface by acid erosion could not be totally recovered after in vitro remineralization. The wear volume of the acid-eroded enamel decreased obviously after remineralization, but it was still much higher than that of the original enamel. In summary, remineralization in artificial saliva could improve the anti-wear properties of acid-eroded enamel. The results would be helpful to extend the understanding of the remineralization repair mechanism for acid-eroded human tooth enamel. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960676447	Investigation on the microtribological behaviour of human tooth enamel by nanoscratch	With a nanoscratch tester, the microtribological behaviour of human tooth enamel was investigated by a spherical diamond tip. Before tests, the molars were longitudinally sectioned, well polished and etched in 0.001. M citric acid solution for 1 min. The experimental results indicated that the scratching behaviour of enamel was closely associated with its microstructure. Due to the "buffer" effect of the inter-rod enamel, the scratch-induced damage along the parallel direction to the enamel rod axis was weaker than that along the vertical direction especially under high loads. Under the same load, the scratch depth on the inter-rod enamel was much larger than that on the enamel rods. When the normal load increased from 0 to 0.5. mN during scratching, the size of enamel hydroxyapatite (HA) particles was found to gradually decrease from 70 nm to 20 nm. Since such behaviour may be helpful to release the stress concentration and prevent the propagation of micro cracks in teeth during the masticating process, it can effectively improve the wear property of teeth. Finally, after the scratched sample was remineralized in the artificial saliva solution, the size of particles on the surface was found to increase to 200 nm and the scratching damage could be repaired to some extent. The results may provide useful suggestions on the development of dental restorative materials and biomimetic materials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960684790	Effect of low-temperature plasma carbonitriding on the fretting behaviour of 316LVM medical grade austenitic stainless steels	An optimized low-temperature plasma carbonitriding process at 430. °C for 15 h was used to treat the surface of 316LVM medical grade austenitic stainless steel. By using a servo-hydraulic dynamic test machine, the fretting behaviour of both as-received and the surface-treated 316LVM plate samples against martensitic stainless steel balls was studied in the Ringer's solution at various displacement amplitudes. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimized low-temperature plasma surface treatment can produce a precipitate-free, C/N supersaturated S-phase layer. Such layer revealed a hardness of 5 times that of 316LVM substrate. The formation of S-phase can protect the 316LVM from corrosion in the Ringer's solution, and the hard surface-treated layer can significantly improve the fretting wear resistance of 316LVM material. When fretted in a mixed regime, a sharp drop of friction force was observed for untreated 316LVM after fretting for about 1000 cycles, which was mainly caused by the penetration of Ringer's solution into the contact area of the fretting pairs. As a comparison, no friction drop was observed through the fretting process on the surface-treated samples. Due to the high ratio of elastic modulus to hardness (E/. H) of untreated sample, the main damage mechanism on untreated sample was adhesive and abrasive wear during the fretting process. However, because of the high hardness and low E/. H ratio of the surface-treated sample, the main damage mechanism was mild abrasive wear. In conclusion, the low temperature plasma surface treatment can effectively improve the fretting wear properties of 316LVM stainless steel, which could pave the way to develop the high-performance, long-life body implants. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

79960429416	Current state and progress in the research of squeaking in ceramic-on-ceramic hip prosthesis	The research work and progress in squeaking of ceramic-on-ceramic hip prosthesis in the past ten years are reviewed from three viewpoints of surgical implantation, design of partner components and friction-induced vibration. So far, the generation mechanisms of squeaking in ceramic-on-ceramic hips are mainly attributed to the wear of implanted hips and shortcomings in prosthetic design. However, these mechanisms can not statistically explain all the physical phenomena of squeaking in ceramic-on-ceramic hips. Several investigators suggested that the squeaking of ceramic-on-ceramic hip prosthesis may be induced by the friction-induced vibration of ceramic-on-ceramic hip prosthesis, but their work has just got going. Up to now, the main mechanism of squeaking generation has not been completely understood. It is suggested that the further study on the hips squeaking should be carried out from the interdisciplines of friction-induced vibration and in vivo kinetics of hip prosthesis, so as to better acquire the understanding of the squeaking generation mechanism.

The nanostructures, such as nanodots, nanolines, surface mesas and nanowords, can be produced on the target surface by programming the tip traces according to the demanded patterns. The height of these nanostructures increases with the increase of the number of scratching cycles or the normal load. Transmission electron microscope observations indicated that the lattice distortion and dislocations induced by the mechanical interaction may have played a dominating role in the formation of the protrusive nanostructures on quartz surfaces. Further analysis reveals that during scratching, a contact pressure ranged from 0.4P

84858990559	Towards a deeper understanding of the formation of friction-induced hillocks on monocrystalline silicon	Friction-induced hillocks can be produced on monocrystalline silicon by scratching under given conditions. Results show that the height of these hillocks increases with the applied normal load or number of scratching cycles, but decreases with the sliding velocity. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis show that the hillock contains a thin superficial oxidation layer and a thick disturbed (amorphous and deformed) layer in the subsurface. Although the formation of the silicon hillock is the combined results of mechanical interaction and tribochemical reaction, the mechanical interaction plays a more dominant role. Further analysis indicates that the formation of hillock is mostly induced by the amorphization of crystal silicon during scratching. Low sliding speed is found to facilitate the formation of a thick amorphization layer under the same loading condition. Since the friction-induced hillock is the initial surface damage on the nanoscale, the results will shed new light on understanding and controlling the nanowear process of silicon in micro/nanoelectromechanical systems. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84862976261	Effects of screen-grid bias voltage on the microstructure and properties of the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) modified by oxygen plasma	The specimens of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) were treated by oxygen plasma using a pulse-biased screen-grid technique under different negative bias conditions. The screen-grid was used to provide an electric field to accelerate the oxygen ions towards the UHMWPE substrate during the plasma treatment process. The effects of the screen-grid voltage on the surface microstructure, wettability, mechanical properties and wear resistance of UHMWPE were investigated. It was found that the degree of crosslinking, oxidation, wettability and surface roughness of UHMWPE can be increased with the increasing of the screen-grid voltage. Owing to the increase of the degree of crosslinking, the hardened layer formed on the surface of the UHMWPE samples was also strengthened greatly with the increase of the grid voltage. However, the wear results indicated that the UHMWPE sample modified at higher bias voltage exhibits poor wear performance, which could be mainly related to the embrittlement resulted from the aggravation of oxidation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863233439	Fabrication mechanism of friction-induced selective etching on Si(100) surface	As a maskless nanofabrication technique, friction-induced selective etching can easily produce nanopatterns on a Si(100) surface. Experimental results indicated that the height of the nanopatterns increased with the KOH etching time, while their width increased with the scratching load. It has also found that a contact pressure of 6.3 GPa is enough to fabricate a mask layer on the Si(100) surface. To understand the mechanism involved, the cross-sectional microstructure of a scratched area was examined, and the mask ability of the tip-disturbed silicon layer was studied. Transmission electron microscope observation and scanning Auger nanoprobe analysis suggested that the scratched area was covered by a thin superficial oxidation layer followed by a thick distorted (amorphous and deformed) layer in the subsurface. After the surface oxidation layer was removed by HF etching, the residual amorphous and deformed silicon layer on the scratched area can still serve as an etching mask in KOH solution. The results may help to develop a low-destructive, low-cost, and flexible nanofabrication technique suitable for machining of micro-mold and prototype fabrication in micro-systems. © 2012 Guo et al.

0037266801	Thermally activated lubrication with alkanes: The effect of chain length	Friction forces measurements between smooth surfaces across two layers of linear alkanes over five decades of speeds are presented. A maximum friction dissipation is observed at a characteristic speed. This behaviour is described by a new approach: the formation and destruction of molecular bridges between confined alkane layers. These bridges which interdigitate between the layers exhibit a thermally activated resistance to shear. An analytical model involving activation barriers accounts for the overall behaviour of the speed dependence of the forces over four decades. This first simple semi-quantitative description sheds new light on the subtle mechanisms of friction at the nanoscale level and shows how the molecular length influences the tribological properties of the liquid.

84874177841	Effect of sliding velocity on the wear behavior of monocrystalline silicon under various contact size	The effect of sliding velocity on the wear behavior of monocrystalline silicon under various contact size is studied by nanoscratch and servo hydraulic dynamic test machine. It is found that both the contact size and sliding velocity played significant roles in the friction-induced surface damage of silicon. When the contact size is small enough to be considered as single-asperity contact, the surface damage of silicon exhibited the formation of hillock under low load. With the increase in the sliding velocity, the friction-induced amorphous layer became thinner and the height of hillock is lower. As the contact pressure increased above the hardness of silicon, the surface damage of silicon is identified as the generation of groove. The higher of the sliding velocity, the stronger the work-hardening of the contact area, and the shallower the groove. As a comparison, when the contact size is large enough to be considered as multi-asperity contact, the silicon surface may be worn even though the contact pressure is much lower than the hardness of silicon. During the wear process, both plough, fatigue and oxidation wear occurre simultaneously. With the increase in the sliding velocity, more cracks are initiated, tinier wear debris is generated, and less wear volume is observed. The results may not only help the improvement of the nanofabrication technique of silicon, but also optimize the tribological design of microelectromechanical system. ©2013 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84875662453	Nanotribological behaviors of friction-induced hillocks on monocrystalline silicon	With an atomic force microscope, friction and wear behaviors of the friction induced hillocks on monocrystalline silicon were investigated. With the increase of normal load from one to twelve microNewtown, the friction force on silicon substrate showed a sharp increase at eight microNewtown, while the friction force on the hillocks kept a stably linear increase. Since no scratch damage was detected on the hillock below a contact pressure of ten point three gigaPascal, the friction induced hillocks on silicon can withstand the typical contact and sliding in dynamic devices. It was also noted that the friction induced hillock presented anisotropic friction and wear behaviors during scratching. The sliding parallel to the scanning direction for producing the hillock can reduce the friction in dynamic devices. This study can shed new light on potential application of the friction induced nanostructures. © 2012 IEEE.

84878347677	Mechanical performance of friction-induced protrusive nanostructures on monocrystalline silicon and quartz	Through nanoindentation and nanoscratch tests, it is demonstrated that friction-induced protrusive nanostructures (or hillocks) showed good mechanical behaviour. At the maximum indentation depth of 2 nm, the elastic modulus of the hillocks on the silicon/quartz surface was only 5.3/14.8 lower than that measured on their substrates. After scratching under a contact pressure of 10.3 GPa on silicon hillocks or 7.2 GPa on quartz hillocks, no surface damage was observed on the scratched area. Hence, the friction-induced hillocks can withstand typical contact in dynamic MEMS. Even though the scratch depths were much larger than the height of the detected hillocks, no peeling-off scar or surface crack could be detected beside the grooves on the hillocks, which indicated that the hillocks bonded strongly to their substrates. Further analysis revealed that the strength of the friction-induced hillocks was strongly dependent on the friction-induced process. The hillock produced at high sliding speed can lead to a high elastic modulus. Transmission electron microscope detection showed that the deformed silicon matrix formed chiefly at high sliding speed can enhance the elastic modulus of the hillocks. As a comparison, the amorphous silicon layer formed mainly at low sliding speed can reduce the elastic modulus of the hillocks. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

It consists of 92-96% inorganic substances, 1-2% organic materials, and 3-4% water by weight. The contribution of water content to its wear mechanism has not been fully understood yet. In this paper, nano-indentation and scratch tests were performed on human tooth enamel after different drying time to study the effect of water content on the nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviour. The recovery of enamel's tribological properties in water was also investigated by immersing the dried enamel specimens in deionized water. Results showed that the water content within enamel had a significant influence on its nanomechanical properties and microtribological performance. The nanoindentation hardness of enamel increased with the increase of drying time, but its elastic modulus decreased. The friction coefficient and wear loss of enamel also increased. Moreover, an increasing fluctuation occurred to the friction coefficient of enamel as the drying time increased. Microscopic examinations showed that a few micro-voids appeared on the worn surface of dried enamel, and the voids became more and more obvious with the increase of drying time. Additionally, both the friction coefficient and wear loss of the dried enamel specimen were found to significantly decrease after being immersed in water. These results indicated that the water content within human tooth enamel could reduce the value and fluctuation of friction force on the surface and protect the surface from wear damage. The anti-wear properties of enamel decreased with the decrease of its water content. The results would be helpful to extend an understanding of the relationship between the enamel chemical composition and its tribological properties and then develop new dental materials. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879167122	Effect of adsorption time on the lubricating properties of the salivary pellicle on human tooth enamel	Lubrication is the primary function of saliva in the mouth, which is closely associated with the adsorbed salivary proteins. Previous studies have suggested that the amount of adsorbed salivary proteins on the surfaces of human teeth depends on adsorption time. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of adsorption time on the lubricating performance of human whole saliva. In this paper, nano-scratch tests were performed on the salivary pellicle formed on human tooth enamel after different adsorption times. Adsorption was conducted in vitro by immersing the enamel specimens in human saliva under different time intervals. The results showed that at the early stage of adsorption, a thin and dense salivary pellicle was formed on the enamel surface. As the adsorption time increased, some scattered protuberances appeared on the surface of the initial layer. With the adsorption time further increasing, more and more protuberances appeared. Finally the initial layer was completely covered by the protuberances. The amount of proteins in the salivary pellicle increased with the adsorption time, but no significant variation occurred to the kinds of the adsorbed proteins. Friction-wear tests by a nano-scratch tester indicated that both the friction coefficient and wear loss of the enamel surface significantly decreased after the surface was covered with salivary pellicle. For the saliva-adsorbed enamel surface, the friction coefficient increased with the adsorption time, but no obvious changes happened to either the wear morphology or the wear loss. In summary, the salivary pellicle changed with the adsorption time, and the initial salivary pellicle exhibited an excellent lubricating effect on human tooth enamel. The results would be helpful to extend the understanding of the lubricating mechanism of human whole saliva and then to develop new artificial saliva. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84879176785	Nano-scratch behavior of human root canal wall dentin lubricated with EDTA pastes	The present study evaluated the wear behavior of human root canal dentin and the lubricating effect of EDTA pastes using nano-scratch tests in vitro. The human root canal wall specimens were tested under a constant load of 80 mN and the lubricating effect of different concentrations of EDTA pastes were analyzed. EDTA lubrication strengthened wear effect on the root canal dentin. The application of EDTA paste decreased the microhardness and wear resistance of root canal wall. The wear mechanism of root canal dentin changed from plastic deformation to a combination of deformation, delamination, and microcrack propagation because of the strengthening effect of EDTA pastes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84883312000	Effect of salt concentration on the conformation and friction behaviour of DNA	Double-stranded DNA films (200. bp) were prepared on 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (APS)-modified mica surfaces in the NaCl solution with concentration ranging from 0.001 to 0.1. M. By using an atomic force microscope, the force-distance curve and friction behaviour of each DNA film was studied in the NaCl solution that was used in the sample preparation. When the concentration of NaCl solution decreased from 0.1 to 0.001. M, the range of non-linear repulsion on DNA films increased from 8.6 to 29.1. nm, which suggested that lower salt concentration likely resulted in more extended DNA molecules. At the same time, the friction force on DNA films increased by 190% under a normal load of 2.5. nN, which was attributed to the conformation changes in the DNA molecules induced by the electrolyte ions. Therefore, low salt concentration is more conducive to the sequencing process, since it can not only make DNA molecules easier to reach into nanopore through extended conformation, but also reduce the passage rate by high friction. The results have important implications for the development of the third-generation sequencing technique based on nanopore. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84884816291	Microtribological behaviour of human tooth enamel and artificial hydroxyapatite	The microtribological behaviour of human tooth enamel and artificial hydroxyapatite has been studied and compared in this paper using a nano-scratch tester, aiming to extend the understanding of the wear mechanism of enamel. Results showed that the microtribological behaviour of enamel differed obviously from that of artificial hydroxyapatite. Compared with the artificial hydroxyapatite, more significant plastic deformation happened to the enamel under low loads, but no brittle delamination mechanism occurred even under high loads. Enamel microstructure plays an extremely significant role in its microtribological behaviour. The results would be helpful for the development of new dental restorative materials. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84884575860	Effect of CPP-ACP on the remineralization of acid-eroded human tooth enamel: Nanomechanical properties and microtribological behaviour study	Casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) has been used to enhance tooth remineralization in the dental clinic. But the contribution of CPP-ACP to the remineralization of acid-eroded human tooth enamel is of widespread controversy. To confirm the application potential of CPP-ACP in the remineralization repair of tooth erosion caused by acid-attack, the effect of remineralization in vitro in 2% w/v CPP-ACP solution on the acid-eroded human tooth enamel was investigated in this study. The repair of surface morphology and the improvement of nanomechanical and microtribological properties were characterized with laser confocal scanning microscope, scanning electron microscope, nanoindentation tester and nanoscratch tester. Results showed that a layer of uneven mineral deposits, which were mainly amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) in all probability, was observed on the acid-eroded enamel surface after remineralization. Compared with the acid-eroded enamel surface, the nanoindentation hardness and Young's modulus of the remineralized enamel surface obviously increased. Both the friction coefficient and wear volume of the acid-eroded enamel surface decreased after remineralization. However, both the nanomechanical and the anti-wear properties of the remineralized enamel surface were still inferior to those of original enamel surface. In summary, tooth damage caused by acid erosion could be repaired by remineralization in CPP-ACP solution, but the repair effect, especially on the nanomechanical and anti-wear properties of the acid-eroded enamel, was limited. These results would contribute to a further exploration of the remineralization potential of CPP-ACP and a better understanding of the remineralization repair mechanism for acid-eroded human tooth enamel. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84887089324	Effect of scan parameters and etching temperature on low-destructive nanofabrication of quartz	Maskless and low-destructive nanofabrication on quartz surface can be realised by friction-induced selective etching. In this reported work, the effect of scan parameters and etching temperature on low-destructive nanofabrication of quartz was studied. It was found that the etching thickness increased with the increase of the scan load and the number of scan cycles, but decreased with the scan speed. The wear of quartz did not help to increase the etching thickness. To limit the possible destruction, the scanning should be finished under lowdestructive conditions. Compared with single scanning under high load, repeated scanning under lower load was more beneficial for fabricating a deeper structure in a low-destructive way. To improve the fabrication efficiency, faster scan speed and higher etching temperature were the preferential selection. Based on the optimisation of the fabrication parameters, various styles of nanostructures can be produced on the quartz surface. These results will help realise the controllable low-destructive nanofabrication on quartz. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

84890759155	A multi-probe micro-fabrication apparatus based on the friction-induced fabrication method	A novel multi-probe micro-fabrication apparatus was developed based on the friction-induced fabrication method. The main parts of the apparatus include actuating device, loading system, and control system. With a motorized XY linear stage, the maximum fabrication area of 50 mm × 50 mm can be achieved, and the maximum sliding speed of probes can be as high as 10 mm/s. Through locating steel micro balls into indents array, the preparation of multi-probe array can be realized by a simple and low-cost way. The cantilever was designed as a structure of deformable parallelogram with two beams, by which the fabrication force can be precisely controlled. Combining the friction-induced scanning with selective etching in KOH solution, various micro-patterns were fabricated on Si(100) surface without any masks or exposure. As a low-cost and high efficiency fabrication device, the multi-probe micro-fabrication apparatus may encourage the development of friction-induced fabrication method and shed new light on the texture engineering. © 2013 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84891494938	Effect of chain length on the conformation and friction behaviour of DNA	Four double-stranded DNA films with different chain lengths were prepared on 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS)-modified mica surfaces in the NaCl solution with concentration ranging from 0.001 to 0.1 M. By using an atomic force microscope, the force-distance curves and friction behaviour of each DNA film were studied in the NaCl solution that was used in the sample preparation. When adsorbed on mica as films in salt solution, the conformation of DNA molecules would be a combination of loops and "train-like". As the chain length increased from 50 to 20000 bp, the extension rate of DNA film increased from 7.1 to 11.5 in 0.001 mol/L NaCl solution, which suggested that the DNA molecule with long chain likely resulted in more extended conformation. In addition, under low normal load, low NaCl concentration could increase the friction of DNA film and the chain length revealed insignificant effect on the friction force of DNA film. Therefore, long chain DNA with low salt concentration is more conducive to the nanopore sequencing process, since extended conformation can make DNA molecules easier to reach into nanopore and the high friction can reduce the translocation speed. These results may benefit the development of the third-generation sequencing technique based on nanopore. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84892903989	Effects of vapor environment and counter-surface chemistry on tribochemical wear of silicon wafers	The effects of counter-surface chemistry and adsorption of water and alcohol from the environment on the tribological responses of silicon surfaces were investigated using atomic force microscopy. When scratching with SiO2 tips at contact pressures below the hardness of the materials, changing the environment yielded drastically different wear behaviors. In humid air, the adsorbed water molecules facilitated wear of the surface and material removal. In N2 environment, there was subsurface deformation but no wear, so the surface protruded outward in the rubbing region. In the ethanol vapor condition, the adsorbed alcohol molecules acted as a lubricant and prevented any discernible changes to the surface even at contact pressures above 1 GPa. These results extend upon previous studies of vapor-phase alcohol lubrication using even more protective longer-chain alcohols where failure was observed at much lower contact pressures in macroscale tests, probably due to high-pressure asperity contacts. Thus, the chemical environment can govern the response of silicon to mechanical rubbing. Rubbing with a diamond tip, however, yielded protrusions in all three environments, showing that the chemistry of the counter-surface also contributes to the tribological response; in this case, diamond is not tribochemically reactive toward Si surface. The protrusion formed by the diamond tip in ethanol vapor was only*20 % the height of the one in humid air, even though the measured friction coefficients (and so the applied shear forces) were similar. These results clearly show that the surface chemistry at the tribological interface can substantially alter both the wear and subsurface damage processes. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.

84897800489	Maskless micro/nanofabrication on GaAs surface by friction-induced selective etching	In the present study, a friction-induced selective etching method was developed to produce nanostructures on GaAs surface. Without any resist mask, the nanofabrication can be achieved by scratching and post-etching in sulfuric acid solution. The effects of the applied normal load and etching period on the formation of the nanostructure were studied. Results showed that the height of the nanostructure increased with the normal load or the etching period. XPS and Raman detection demonstrated that residual compressive stress and lattice densification were probably the main reason for selective etching, which eventually led to the protrusive nanostructures from the scratched area on the GaAs surface. Through a homemade multi-probe instrument, the capability of this fabrication method was demonstrated by producing various nanostructures on the GaAs surface, such as linear array, intersecting parallel, surface mesas, and special letters. In summary, the proposed method provided a straightforward and more maneuverable micro/nanofabrication method on the GaAs surface. © 2014 Tang et al.

84903374360	Mechanochemical wear of soda lime silica glass in humid environments	The mechanochemical wear of multicomponent glasses was studied under controlled humidity conditions using a reciprocating ball-on-flat tribometer. For dry conditions, the surfaces were extensively damaged by scratching for all of the glasses, while for humid conditions the wear behavior varied with the glass composition suggesting a chemical effect on scratch behaviors of glass surfaces. The wear of soda lime silica (also called sodium calcium silicate) glass was suppressed with increasing humidity, while the borosilicate and barium boroaluminosilicate glasses showed an increase in wear volume with increasing humidity. The unique humidity dependence of the observed mechanochemical wear of soda lime silica glass supports the hypothesis that hydronium ion formation in the sodium-leached sites of the soda lime glass enhances its wear resistance. © 2014 The American Ceramic Society.

84907578646	Fabrication of large scale texture on monocrystalline silicon surface based on friction-induced selective etching method	The rapid development of high-technology area, such as information, biology and advanced manufacturing, puts forward new and stringent requirements for micro/nano fabrication method. It is essential to develop new methods for the micro/nano fabrication on silicon surface at large scale. By using self-built micro/nano fabrication equipment, large-area textures with various shapes are fabricated on monocrystalline silicon surface based on friction-induced selective etching method. The effect of pattern shape and line space of textures on the contact angle of silicon surface is studied. The results show that the smaller the line space, the larger the contact angle of texture. #-shaped texture reveals better hydrophobic property than the linear texture, which can increase the contact angle of silicon surface as large as 145%. In addition, the textured surface shows a good stability. Even after fabrication for one month, almost no change is detected for the contact angle on textured silicon surface. Therefore, the friction-induced selective etching provides a new approach to realize the functional texture on monocrystalline silicon surface at large scale.

10444236604	Dynamic friction by polymer/surfactant mixtures adsorbed on surfaces	A cationic polyelectrolyte was adsorbed on mica from highly concentrated solutions. The friction and surface force behaviors of the adsorbed layers in aqueous media were studied using a new homemade surface force apparatus (SFA). The long-range repulsions produced by the pure cationic polymer at low salt concentration indicate that the chains are in an extended conformation. The addition of anionic surfactant or of salt condenses the cationic polymer chains as evidenced by the much shorter range of the repulsions. These forces are, for both conformations, a combination of steric and double-layer forces. During sliding, the friction forces produced by the adsorbed layers increase monotonically with the load. A strong dependence of these forces on the sliding speed is noticeable for the extended conformations, while the dependence vanishes in the coiled conformations. This study shows the important role of the conformational state of adsorbed polymer chains on their tribological properties.
