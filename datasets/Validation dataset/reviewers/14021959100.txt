0033907791	Fabrication of all-fiber bandpass filter using single fiber Bragg grating	We analyze and experimentally demonstrate that both the bandwidth of the fiber Bragg grating (FBG)'s short wavelength loss and the bandwidth of the FBG's reflection increase with the increase of strain gradient along the length of the grating. Based on this phenomenon, we experimentally demonstrate a simple method of fabricating tunable all-fiber monochannel bandpass filter using a single strong FBG. A filter with a approximately 3.5 nm width stopband and a approximately 0.4 nm width passband is achieved in the standard single mode fiber. The strong short wavelength loss of FBG acts as a stopband on the short wavelength side, through which the incident light cannot pass because its core mode is coupled to the cladding mode. The reflection peak of FBG acts as a stopband on the long wavelength side, through which incident light cannot pass because the forward propagating core mode is coupled to backward propagating core mode. The gap between the reflection and the short wavelength loss acts as a passband, through which the light can pass with a low amount of loss. The strain gradient along the grating is used to improve the performance of the filter; it not only broadens the two stopbands but also reduces the width of the passband.

The main advantage of using a silica host is that it provides low propagation loss, high gain, large bandwidth and high chemical durability. It has been predicted that the fiber lasers have many advantages including very high conversion efficiency, immunity from thermal lensing effect due to large ratio of surface area to volume, no need of beam steering, simplicity of optical cavity construction, excellent beam quality, small volume and weight, low cost, and inherently fiber-coupled output.

The formation of conducting phases was demonstrated to be highly temperature sensitive, as evidenced by strong dependence of the electrical conductivity on repetition rate and ambient temperature. XPS and Raman studies showed that the efficiency of the formation of conducting phases could be enhanced by the increase of temperature on irradiated polyimide film surfaces. After the disruption of polymeric chain, the carbon-enriched clusters remained on the irradiated polyimide film surfaces organized into polycrystalline graphite-like clusters responsible for electrical conductivity. The resulting dangling bonds from the decomposition process of polyimide acted as centers for the rearrangement of carbon-enriched clusters. It is suggested that the motion of radicals was promoted with increasing the temperature. Therefore the formation of polycrystalline graphite-like clusters benefited from high remaining temperature on the irradiated polyimide film surfaces. These results revealed that thermal influence played a dominant role on the formation of conducting phases.

The characteristics of the uncoated devices with and without gratings are tested under room temperature continuous-wave conditions without any temperature-control device and compared. The devices with gratings achieve high powers of up to 385 mW/facet and a small lateral far-field angle of 2.7° at 1.5 A, have only 4.13 nm/A wavelength-shift, and 0.09 nm spectral linewidth at 600 mA, and operate in a stable longitudinal mode. Devices without gratings operate in multimode, with a larger lateral far-field angle (7.3°) and spectral linewidth (1.3 nm), although with higher output powers. Because of the integration of second-order metal gratings and their very high coupling capability, the output beam quality is improved greatly, the lasing wavelength is stable and varies slowly with changes in injection current, while the spectrum is narrowed dramatically, and the far-field angles are greatly reduced. This opens the way for the realization of watt-scale power broad-stripe (>100 μm) surface second-order metal grating end and surface-emitting DFB lasers and arrays with single frequency, single mode operation and high output beam quality. © 2012 The Author(s).

The fauna from this area used to be taken as a benchmark for the biochronological comparison of Quaternary paleontology of South China, but the chronology of this fauna has many controversies for the lack of exact locational and stratigraphical records. The present article, on the basis of recent investigations and discoveries, discusses and explains the distribution and biochronology of the mammalian faunas in the Yanjinggou area.

The presence of Early Pleistocene mammalian fauna in the Yanjinggou area is therefore confirmed. The "Wanhsien fauna" or "Yenchingkou (=Yanjinggou) fauna" as a Mid-Late Pleistocene biostratigraphical datum should be abandoned.

42549089325	The spectral feature analysis of semiconductor thin disk laser	The semiconductor thin disk laser is a new type of semiconductor laser. This work gives the basic operation function of semiconductor disk laser, and analyses the heat effect by the experimentally measured photoluminescence spectrum of the laser chip at different pump power and different temperature. We can see that: with increasing pump power, the thermal effects of the gain material becomes seriously and causes the saturation of carrier lifetime, so the electron-hole pair created in the absorbtion layer have no enough time to rate to one of the wells, and the non-radiative recombination happens in the barrier. When the thermal effects becomes stronger, the chip will not lasing. This phenomenon is from the smaller energy offset between barrier and quantum well. We optimize the original structure design and experimental technology. A non-absorbing AlGaAs layer who is transparent to the pumping and laser wavelength is added to confine the carriers in the quantum wells. At the same time a DBR with double reflecting band is induced to improve the absorbing efficiency of the pumping light. The single QW is replaced by the three narrow QWs, This three QWs structure can add the quantum state of QW, increase the recombination probability of carriers in the QWs and reduce the heat effect. The chemical etch equipment is also improved to control the surface unevenness to be within 50 nm.

50949110284	808 nm high power diode laser stack with polarization coupling	High-power diode lasers based on GaAs semiconductor bars meanwhile are well established as reliable and highly efficient laser sources. Continuous improvement of the semiconductor material itself as well as mounting and cooling techniques during the last years have led to increased output power and high lifetimes. In many cases high power diode lasers are on the way to replace flashtubes for solid state laser pumping. By realizing arrangements of many high-power diode laser elements, e. g. diode laser stacks, the overall output power can be increased further up to the kW range. In this power level, we can have many important applications, such as surgery, welding of polymers, soldering, coatings and surface treatment of metals. But there are some applications, which require much higher power and brightness, e. g. hardening, key hole welding, cutting and metal welding. In addition, high power diode lasers in the military also have important applications. So all developed countries have attached great importance to high-power diode laser system and its applications. Germany is developing initiative "BRIOLAS" ( brilliant diode lasers) program, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is supporting the BRIOLAS-initiative with about 30 M∈. The United States have launched "SHEDS" (High Efficiency Diode Sources) from 2005. Now Germany laserline corporation have products, that direct diode laser system have largest output power of 10 000 W, and fiber coupled diode laser system have largest output power of 8 000 W into the 1.5 mm diameter of the fiber. We know that under certain circumstances the light, which is emitted from the diode laser bar is linearly polarized, and the polarization degree can be 95 %-98 %. So polarization coupling technology makes two laser beam of perpendicular polarization direction reciprocally together, that is another effective way to improve the power and the brightness of diode lasers. After fast axis collimating, the polarization direction of one laser stack is rotated 90° through a half-wave plate, thus, the polarization directions of two laser stack are vertical reciprocally. The beams of two lasers are incident to polarization filter; one transmits through it, and the other is bent on it. Finally two beams combine to one. In this paper, it mainly introduces the principle of polarization coupling, technique route, experiment result and analysis. The polarization coupling efficiency can achieve 90% for two LD stacks with seven bars whose emission wavelength is 808 nm. The efficiency of 67% can be achieved after focusing to the beam size of 4.5 mm × 4.5 mm.

55649084617	Polarization characteristics of 980 nm high power vertical cavity surface emitting laser	Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) have many advantages such as low threshold current and single mode operation, as well as easy to be fabricated in high-density arrays and low cost in manufacturing. VCSELs are used in many areas, for example, optical communications, optical interconnections, and optical signal processing. But in some applications, the polarization orientation is sensitive, such as optic recording and laser frequency doubling. It is necessary to control the polarization characteristics of VCSEL effectively. In fact, the reliable control of the polarization orientation, of single devices with small emission window is realized through many methods, in which the most popular one is the sub-wavelength surface grating technique. But due to the existence of multi-transverse modes in high power VCSEL devices with large emission window, the polarization orientation changes from one basic state to the other orthogonal one depending on the input current and temperature. The temperature dependence of the polarization characteristics of a 980 nm bottom-emitting laser with 500 μm emitting aperture is investigated. The temperature changes from 298 K to 368 K with a increasing step of 5 K. It is not easy to directly measure the temperature of the active region, so the temperature of the heatsink is used to characterize the temperature of the active region. A polarization beam splitter (PBS) element is used to split the two orthogonal polarization states into transmission wave and reflection wave, respectively. The output powers and center-wavelengths of these two orthogonal polarizations states are measured by using a semiconductor laser parameters test system. The temperature dependence of the output power of each polarization state is the same as that of the total output power of the device without the PBS. The center-wavelength difference between the two polarization states increases slowly with increasing temperature. When comparing the polarization behavior of both states, we find that the reflection state reaches threshold of lasing before the transmission state when the device is kept at a temperature below 328 K. But the output power in the transmission state rises quickly than that in the reflection state. At every temperature, there is a certain current where the powers in the two states are equal with increasing the current. With increasing the current further, the power in the transmission state is higher than that in the reflection state. And when the device is kept at a temperature above 328 K, there is no obvious alternation point between the two states, and the power in the transmission state is higher than that in the reflection state all the time. The reason may be that at low temperature and low current, the heat effect is not serious, the red shifts of the reflection wave and transmission wave are both small, but reflection one is a little more, so the reflection wave is closer to the center-wavelength of DBR. With increasing the current, the internal temperature of the device increases seriously, the red shift of reflection state increase faster than that of transmission state, so the transmission wave is closer to the center-wavelength of DBR. At high temperature the heat effect is serious, whatever at low current and high current, both of the red shifts are big, so the transmission wave is closer to DBR center-wavelength all the time. According to the detailed investigation on the polarization characteristics of large diameter VCSEL device, a method with an external resonator was proposed to realize a stable polarization orientation with a resonance length of about 0.45 mm.

With the increase of input current, the temperature characteristics of the device were measured in the temperature range from 0 degree to 100 degree.Temperature test of laser output charactristic was made at different temperature.And the experimental results show that the lowest threshold current at room temperature results from an optimal matching between DBR and active region.

The wavelength coupling technology was used to couple two laser beams with wavelength of 808 nm and 980 nm together, the beam splitter cube and optical focusing lens were designed for the experiment. Experimental results show that the overall efficiency is about 70% and spot size about 3 mm × 3 mm, which can satisfy the system application requirements for metal cladding and welding directly.

62649118807	808nm high-power high-efficiency GaAsP/GaInP laser bars	808nm high power diode lasers, which is rapidly maturing technology technically and commercially since the introduction in 1999 of complete kilowatt-scale diode laser systems, have important applications in the fields of industry and pumping solid-state lasers (DPSSL). High power and high power conversion efficiency are extremely important in diode lasers, and they could lead to new applications where space, weight and electrical power are critical. High efficiency devices generate less waste heat, which means less strain on the cooling system and more tolerance to thermal conductivity variation, a lower junction temperature and longer lifetimes. Diode lasers with Al-free materials have superior power conversion efficiency compared with conventional AlGaAs/GaAs devices because of their lower differential series resistance and higher thermal conductivity. 808nm GaAsP/GalnP broad-waveguide emitting diode laser bars with 1mm cavity length have been fabricated. The peak power can reach to 100.9W at 106.5A at quasicontinuous wave operation (200μs, 1000Hz). The maximum power conversion efficiency is 57.38%. Based on these high power laser bars, we fabricate a 1 ×3 arrays, the maximum power is 64.3 W in continuous wave mode when the current is 25.0A. And the threshold current is 5.9A, the slope efficiency is 3.37 W/A. © 2008 SPIE.

70349182532	A theoretical model of high power VCSEL based on the thermal-offset-current	Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSEL's) are widely used in optical communication due to their single-longitudinal-mode operation, circular output beams, suitability for monolithic two-dimensional (2-D) integration, and compatibility with on-wafer probe testing. In recent years high power output has been realized by increasing the size of the emission window or by high densely integrating VCSEL array. Accompanying the increase of the output power, the performances such as temperature stability, conversion efficiency, and mode distribution are often deteriorated by the non-uniform distribution of carriers across the active region and the self-heating inside the device. Self-heating results in considerable differences between the operating performances under continuous wave and pulsed operation. Thermal roll-over of the output power with current is observed under continuous wave, which limits on the further increase of lasing power. A theoretical model based on laser rate equation is presented to simulate the output performance of high power VCSEL. In this simulation, thermal offset current is introduced to compensate the threshold current between room temperature and operating current. Thermal characteristics parameter is obtained from the dependence of the output power on the current at different temperature. Other parameters are extracted using the method of Gao et al. The dependence of P and I at certain ambient temperature was calculated according to the model parameters, and it shows a good consistent between the theoretical and the experimental results in the temperature range from room temperature to 100 °C. In addition, the relationship between temperature and current indicates sever temperature increase in the active region.

We theoretically analyze the form of such CFBGs, and study the characteristics of gratings using piecewise-uniform approach. It is shown that increasing UV-induced index change or the length of the grating or both are the efficient ways to obtain high quality CFBG with high reflectivity and good reflection spectrum. The dispersion of this grating is decided by and varies inversely with the slope of the strain gradient along the length of the grating, not decided by UV-induced index change or by the length of grating. One can control the dispersion and the chirp profile by adjusting the slope of the strain gradient.

A general solution to realizing white color OLEDs is to use separate multiple emitter-layers to produce different colors. The white light is achieved based to the color mixing. Unfortunately, the electroluminescent (EL) performances of this kind of devices such as color stability and efficiency still need improved. An optical microcavity has a structure with at least one space dimension on the order of optical wavelength. In a microcavity device, only one or a few optical modes are able to interact with the materials inside. Thus, the interaction between material and light within microcavity is greatly changed comparing with the condition of free space. To obtain white light in MOLED, a multimode within the emission spectrum of the wideband emitter is essential, and can be realized by charging cavity length. However, for the white MOLED with multiple layer structure, the EL performances were seldom reported. We report the realization of a bright white MOLED with a simple two-layer structure and only one emitter layer. An microcavity organic light-emitting diode (MOLED) was developed to emit white light.

The transient and steady-state temperature distribution of the laser diode array is simulated when it works under the condition of 20% high duty cycle. It is found that the temperature of the active region rises slowly within the first few dozen microseconds after turning on current. And then, the temperature rises rapidly due to the heat flux interleaving between adjacent emitters, and finally a steady state is reached due to the thermal relaxation and accumulation effect. The static temperature distribution presents periodicity as the same of the array structure and no temperature difference exists among each emitter. The temperature rising concentrates in the electrode region of the active layer, and the temperature drops rapidly in the insulated region. The emitting facet has a higher temperature, and a max 3 K temperature difference exists along the cavity when the working current is 180 A. The output characteristic of the laser diode array is measured when it works under different currents. The temperature rising of the active region and the steady-state thermal resistance are basically coincident with the simulation.

For 970 nm broad-area VCSOA operated in reflective mode, the maximum gain amplification of 24.8 dB and optical bandwidth of 0.14 nm (25 GHz) were reached when the injection current was 57% of threshold current and the signal input power was 0.7 W. The experimental gain value was larger than the theoretical value, due to many modes existing in VCSOA. Each mode had relative gain amplification, so the experimental gain value was larger than the theoretical value. This kind of broad-area VCSOA was improved not only in optical gain but also in saturated input power. The authors optimized the structure design of the wide area VCSOA of 970 nm. The simulation results showed that the improvement of the gain and bandwidth of the semiconductor laser could be obtained by appropriately reducing the DBR reflectivity of the emitting laser on the vertical cavity surface.

77953890743	Estimating possible impact of human activity on the warm season temperature in Beijing since the industrial era	Global surface temperature shows an increasing trend over the past 100 years. Anthropogenic and natural factors have been invoked to explain this warming, but their relative contribution and the spatial variability remain controversial. Based on a 2650-year temperature record from a stalagmite near Beijing, we explore the possible impacts of human activity on the warm season temperature in Beijing since the industrial era using the method of singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The results suggest that the warm season temperature in Beijing under the natural forcing should have an overall decreasing trend for the past 130 years (1870 to 2000 AD) with an amplitude of 0.45±0.84°C, while the instrumental record and stalagmite data show an increase of 1.08°C. These imply that human activity would have caused an increase in the warm season temperature of Beijing for about 1.53±0.84°C compared to its natural trends, from 1870 AD to 2000 AD. Our results also suggest that anthropogenic forcing began to significantly influence the temperature since 1870 AD, and the effect further intensified since 1915 AD. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The experimental results show that the output powers of VCSELs with 500-μm-diameter active region under the injected current of 6A are 2.01W and 2.09W when the N-DBR reflectivities are 99.7% and 99.2%, respectively. However, the output powers of VCSELs with 200-μm-diameter active region under the injected current of 3A are 0.64W and 1.12W when the N-DBR reflectivities are 99.7% and 99.2%, respectively. It was concluded that the theoretical results are validated by the experiment effectively.

78751471459	Theoretical analysis of emission characteristics of second-order distributed feedback semiconductor lasers	Based on the modified coupled-wave theory, the emission characteristics, including threshold gain, photon density distribution in the cavity, and external differential quantum efficiency for second-order DFB lasers are investigated. Numerical simulation results show that for given device structure with wavelength of 1.55 μm, the feedback coupling coefficient and the surface radiation coupling coefficient of the second-order grating have great influence on the emission characteristics of the device. By choosing different duty cycles of the grating, we can change the two coupling coefficients, which affect the emission characteristics. For an overall consideration, an optimal duty cycle of 0.43 is chosen. The optimized results show that the device works without degeneracy modes and spatial burning hole. Besides, the side-mode suppress ratio (SMSR) and external differential quantum efficiency reach as high as 42 dB and 47%, respectively. © 2010 SPIE.

It was shown that the output power of the rectangle VCSELs can be up to 660mWat a current of 5 A. Both H-polarization (horizontal) and V-polarization (vertical) demonstrated a coherent stabilization over the entire range of operation current, and coherent spectrum blue-shift of H-polarization light occurred with respect to V-polarization light at three different injected currents. The polarization states of output light were stabilized in the twoorthogonal directions and H-polarizationwas themost principal polarization whichwas parallel tothe longer sideof therectangular aperture. Fromtherelationship between polarization ratio and aspect ratio of the oxidation confinement aperture (OCA), it was found that the highest polarization ratio (about 2:1) took placewhen the appropriate aspect ratio was 5:3, which meant better polarization stabilization in large-aperture VCSELs.

Three methods were compared, that was, front and back facet were coated with no facet coating, reflective film, and passivation layer at first, then with reflective film. The test results of semiconductor laser output power show that laser damage threshold of the passivation layer method is 36% higher than only coated reflective film method, and effectively prevents catastrophic optical mirror damage. And the physical effects between the core of semiconductor laser diode and optical thin film were analyzed. Coating passivation film on its facet is effective to increase laser damage threshold of high-power semiconductor laser diode.

A numerical simulation of current density distribution in the active of a large aperture single device and an array element were constructed. It is found that the current density at the perimeter of the oxide aperture is higher than at the center of the active region.

The far-field angle of a single device with a 600 μm oxide aperture decreased from 30°to 15° when the p-contact diameter is optimized from 650 μm to 580 μm, and there is a slight increase in output power due to the optimization. By using an extra Au layer, the output aperture of a 4×4 two dimension array element is decreased to 180 μm, and the far-field angle of the array device is suppressed to 10°. There is a slight drop in output power due to the introduction of the extra Au layer.

Historical documents are unique materials for high-resolution (up to season) climate change reconstruction. Here, we report an attempt of quantitative climate reconstruction covering the main part of north-central China, by combining historical drought/flood index and tree-ring data. The rigorous verification tests confirm the fidelity of transfer functions used in the reconstructions. The precipitation and temperature anomalies/intervals were then defined based on the reconstructions. Finally, the intensity of several big droughts recorded in historical documents was re-examined and the dominant and recessive patterns of heat/water changes within the study area were identified. We concluded that (1) the droughts, occurred during the years of 1484 AD, 1585-1587 AD, 1689-1691 AD, 1784-1786 AD and 1876-1878 AD, were the results of rainless and torrid combination; (2) the droughts, occurred during the years of 1560-1561 AD, 1599-1601 AD, 1609 AD, 1615-1617 AD, 1638-1641 AD and 1899-1901 AD, were first caused by rainless summer, and then controlled by low precipitation and/or high temperature; (3) the droughts, occurred during the years of 1527-1529 AD, 1720-1722 AD, 1813-1814 AD, 1856-1857 AD and 1926-1930 AD, were first caused by torrid summer, and then controlled by both low precipitation and high temperature; (4) the dominant climate pattern within the study area consisted of warm-dry and cold-wet alternations, and the recessive pattern consisted of cold-dry and warm-wet alternations. We also showed that the drought/flood index is a valuable climate proxy in quantitative reconstructions, especially in places where tree-ring data is not available. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

A rectangular-shaped VCSEL is fabricated by etching rectangular mesa structure and rectangular output aperture. The maximum power of bottom-emitting rectangular-shaped VCSEL is 660 mW with 550 μm×300 μm output aperture under continuous wave condition, and the differential resistance is 0.09 Ω. It is found that H-polarization (horizontal) and V-polarization (vertical) demonstrated steadily coexistence over the entire range of operation current. And H-polarization dominated over V-polarization which is parallel to the shorter side of the rectangular output aperture. Compared with the circular-shaped VCSEL, both H-polarization and V-polarization nearly have the same lasing situation. Spectrum blue-shift of H-polarization light occurres with respect to V-polarization light. This phenomenon is explained by the symmetric three layer waveguide model. The dependence of the orthogonal polarization ratio on the aspect ratio of the output aperture is investigated in the rectangular-shaped VCSEL. It is found that the rectangular post is an effective way to stabilize the output polarization of large-aperture VCSEL, which can emit high-power polarized laser.

84859408784	Research on transform lens in spectral beam combination for laser diode array	Plane-convex lens or bi-convex lens are commonly used as transform lens while the beam of laser diode array (LDA) is spectrally combined by grating-external cavity method. However, the feedback efficiency of external cavity is rather low for each emitter. For example, feedback efficiency for on-axis emitter is just 80.5% and even decreases to 49.7% for edge emitter. In order to solve the problem, a method that discretely doublet lenses are applied as transform lenses to enhance the feedback efficiency. An equivalent optical setup of traditional spectrally beam combination for LDA is drawn and studied by Zemax optical software. At the same time, feedback efficiency of each emitter will be computed. The imaging characteristic of plane-convex lens is learned by aberration theory and the fact that spherical aberration and coma of plane-convex lens are relative large, which will decrease the feedback efficiency. Funthermore according to primary aberration theory, a discretely doublet is designed by PW method and the doublet is also optimized by Zemax. The feedback efficiency of each LDA emitter whose width is 10 mm is more than 94.2% by using optimized doublet, which is dramatically larger than that of plane-convex lens.The results show that the method is helpful for increasing the coupling efficiency of LDA.

Single devices with oxide apertures of 415, 386, and 316 μm are made by controlling the oxidation time. Diameters of the mesa and the P type contact are 450 μm and 400 μm, respectively.

84865982302	Climatic response of ring width and maximum latewood density of Larix sibirica in the Altay Mountains, reveals recent warming trends	• Introduction Siberian larch (Larix sibirica) is a highly climate sensitive species. Presently, the Altay Mountains is covered by widespread forests dominated by Siberian larch and thus has a great potential for dendroclimatological studies. However, tree-ring network of the Altay Mountains has not yet been well developed. The development of the new chronologies and the knowledge about the influence of climatic variables on tree growth is needed. • Method X-ray densitometric techniques were applied to obtain ring width (RW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) of Siberian larch from two upper tree line sites in the Altay Mountains, China. Climatic responses in ring widths and maximum latewood densities from the Altay Mountains (China, Russia, and Mongolia) were investigated by simple correlation analyses. To assess the common growth forces among the individual sites of the Altay Mountains, simple correlation, principal component analyses, and spatial correlation analysis were applied over the common period of the chronologies. • Results Ring width and maximum latewood density increases with decreasing precipitation, increasing temperature from late spring to late summer during the growing season. Based on the results of principal component analyses and spatial correlation analysis, summer temperature (June-July) is the most important forces on the Siberian larch growth of the Altay Mountains. The growth of Siberian larch in the Altay Mountains captures the current warming trend. The growth of Siberian larch did not clearly lose its sensitivity under most recent warming in our study areas. • Conclusions The new MXD chronologies is presently the longest, absolutely dated, tree-ring density record yet developed from China. The climate response analysis shows that the RWand MXD of Siberian larch have strong responses to temperature in the growing season. Thus, MXD and RWof Siberian larch provides the best information for climate reconstruction in the warm season. Tree-rings of Siberian larch allow detecting the recently observed warming trend and putting it into the long-term climatic context in the Altay Mountains, due to the strong growth sensitivity to temperature change. © INRA/Springer-Verlag France 2012.

The semiconductor wafer is grown in reverse order: substrate is on the window side and the distributed Bragg reflector is the last grown epilayer. Then the wafer is up-side-down and capillary bonded to a SiC heatsink, and the substrate is chemically etched. Because the total thickness of the substrate-removed structure is less than 10 μm, the thermal management of the laser is significantly improved, and the maximum output power over 0.6 W is obtained using a 3% output coupler and 3.2 W incident pump power. The M2 factors of 1.02 and 1.01 indicate a near-diffraction-limited beam quality.

84867690584	Delayed build-up of Arctic ice sheets during 400,000-year minima in insolation variability	Knowledge of the past variability of climate at high northern latitudes during astronomical analogues of the present interglacial may help to inform our understanding of future climate change. Unfortunately, long-term continuous records of ice-sheet variability in the Northern Hemisphere only are scarce because records of benthic 18 O content represent an integrated signal of changes in ice volume in both polar regions. However, variations in Northern Hemisphere ice sheets influence the Siberian High (an atmospheric pressure system), so variations in the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM)-as recorded in the aeolian dust deposits on the Chinese Loess Plateau-can serve as a useful proxy of Arctic climate variability before the ice-core record begins. Here we present an EAWM proxy record using grain-size variations in two parallel loess sections representative of sequences across the whole of the Chinese Loess Plateau over the past 900,000years. The results show that during periods of low eccentricity and precessional variability at approximately 400,000-year intervals, the grain-size-inferred intensity of the EAWM remains weak for up to 20,000years after the end of the interglacial episode of high summer monsoon activity and strong pedogenesis. In contrast, there is a rapid increase in the EAWM after the end of most other interglacials. We conclude that, for both the 400,000-year interglacials, the weak EAWM winds maintain a mild, non-glacial climate at high northern latitudes for much longer than expected from the conventional loess and marine oxygen isotope records. During these times, the less-severe summer insolation minima at 65°N (ref. 4) would have suppressed ice and snow accumulation, leading to a weak Siberian High and, consequently, weak EAWM winds. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Edge emitting laser is fabricated, and the width of P-contact and stripe of fabricated laser are 10 μm and 20 μm, respectively. From the simulation result, the heat source density deduced from the traditional experience model is much lower than that from the optimized thermal model suggested. Thus a lower temperature rising is proposed in the experience model. By testing the shift of the lasing characteristics at different injected currents, the temperature of active layer is gained. Finally, the change of temperature with injected current obtained from simulation and testing is compared. The temperature rising gained from the experience model is lower than that of the experimental one. However, the new optimized model solves this problem. As a result of the optimized model, the maximum deviation between simulated temperature rising and tested one is about 0.2 K when the injected current is above the threshold current.

84868595518	The design and analysis of sub-wavelength metal-grating large-aperture VCSELs	The polarization control of vertical-cavity surface- emitting lasers with high power emission has been demonstrated by using metal grating to import non-isotropic gain. The grating with a period of 186 nm and a duty ratio of 0.5 was fabricated on the GaAs-cap layer to provide additional reflectance for H-polarization. The pairs of P-distributed Bragg reflectors were reduced to realize the maximum difference threshold gain of two orthogonal polarizations. A polarization ratio of 3 with an output power of 860 mW at continuous-wave operation was demonstrated at room temperature, and the high-order modes were suppressed. As a result, the far-field beam divergence was suppressed to 12°. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84870907575	Reconstructed precipitation for the north-central China over the past 380 years and its linkages to East Asian summer monsoon variability	Drought is a recurring phenomenon in north-central China. Long-term information about the history of drought is still limited because the instrumental records for many areas in north-central China go back only a few decades at best. This paper presents an earlywood width (EWW) chronology of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) in the Shimen Mountains, Tianshui, eastern Gansu, north-central China. The climate-response analysis shows that April-July precipitation is the main factor limiting the earlywood growth of Chinese pines in the Shimen Mountains, Tianshui. Based on the EWW chronology, an April-July precipitation reconstruction for the period A.D. 1629-2008 was developed for Tianshui. The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 41.6% of the observed precipitation variance during the period 1953-2008. Spatial analysis shows that the precipitation reconstruction contains a strong common drought signal for north-central China. Reconstructed drought events are compared to a precipitation reconstruction of Huashan and historical archives for north-central China. The results reveal common climatic extremes over much of north-central China. Moreover, some dry periods coincided with solar minima or volcanic eruptions over the past several hundred years. Multi-taper spectral analysis reveals the existence of significant 3.8-year (90%), 3.1-year (95%), 2.7-year (99%), 2.4-year (99%) and 2.0-year (99%) periods of variability. The linkages to the Asian-Pacific Oscillation Index suggest regional precipitation variations may be linked to the East Asian summer monsoon circulations. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

84870941710	A tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction for the Baluntai region on the southern slope of the central Tien Shan Mountains, China, since A.D. 1464	July-June precipitation has been reconstructed back to A.D. 1464 for the Baluntai region on the southern slope of the central Tien Shan Mountains, China, using the Picea schrenkiana tree-ring width. The reconstruction explains the variance of 51% in the observed precipitation from 1959 to 2005. By employing a 21-year moving average to the reconstruction, nine periods with above average reconstructed precipitation comprised ∼1474-1503, 1550-1577, 1588-1619, 1658-1713, 1790-1812, 1833-1867, 1890-1907, 1923-1944, and 1988-1995∼; eight periods with below average reconstruction consisted of 1504-1549, 1578-1587, 1620-1657, 1714-1789, 1813-1832, 1868-1889, 1908-1922 and 1945-1987. The wet/dry periods of the reconstructed precipitation correspond well with other reconstructions. Some droughts in the historical documents are also precisely captured in the reconstruction. Precipitation variations for the southern slope of the central Tien Shan Mountains are roughly synchronous with that of the northern slope in the recent ∼300 year. Power spectral and wavelet analysis demonstrated the existence of significant ∼100-y, ∼60-y, ∼50-y, ∼16-y, ∼10-y and ∼2-y cycles of variability. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

It points out that the SE-DFB lasers based on special diffractive characteristics of curved grating can achieve the mode control and two-dimensional leaky-mode coupling of laser arrays, and can obtain the laser with narrow line width(typically 0.08 nm), small divergence angle(typically 0.5 mrad), high brightness(3 W(CW) near-diffraction limit emitting from a single device) and high power(73 W maximum in a single device and kW level in arrays). After reviewing the development, present status and new opportunities in future of the SE-DFB devices, it emphasizes that as the curved-grating coupled SE-DFB has both strengths from side emitting and surface emitting devices, it will have great research significance and wide application prospect by introducing into semiconductor lasers and arrays with different material systems and structures.

84872477557	Progress in surface plasmon polariton nano-laser technologies and applications	Conventional semiconductor lasers suffer from the scale of the diffraction limit due to the light to be confined by the optical feedback systems. Therefore, the scales of the lasers cannot be miniaturized because their cavities cannot be less than the half of the lasing wavelength. However, lasers based on the Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) can operate at a deep sub-wavelength, even nanometer scale. Moreover, the development of modern nanofabrication techniques provides the fabrication conditions for micro-or even nanometer scale lasers. This paper reviews the progress in nano-lasers based on SPPs that have been demonstrated recently. It describes the basic principles of the SPPs and gives structures and characteristics for several kinds of nanometer scale lasers. Then, it points out that the major defects of the nanometer scale lasers currently are focused on higher polariton losses and the difficulties in fabrication and electronic pumping technologies mentioned above. Finally, the paper considers the research and application prospects of the nanometer scale lasers based on the SPPs.

84872607695	Tree-ring-based temperature reconstruction for the northern Greater Higgnan Mountains, China, since A.D. 1717	In this paper, ring-width chronologies of pine trees (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica) from one sampling site in the northern Greater Higgnan Mountains, China, were constructed. The results of growth-climate responses show that mean temperature is the limiting factor affecting radial growth of pine trees in the study area. Consequently, mean temperature from May to October from 1717 to 2008 has been reconstructed using the standard chronology. For the calibrated period (1957-2008), the explained variance of the reconstruction is 57%. The characteristics of the reconstruction expose that mean temperature has increased since the 1970s, and the decade 2000s and 1990s are also ranked as the warm decades on record. However, this period from 1970s to now is not exceptional within the past 300 years. By applying an 11-year moving average to the reconstruction, three warm periods and three cold periods are evident. The warm and cold periods of the reconstructed mean temperature correspond well with other reconstructions. Power spectral and wavelet analysis demonstrated the existence of significant ∼70- and ∼100-year cycles of variability. Furthermore, the reconstruction and North Atlantic Oscillation Index showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.34, n = 136, p < 0.0001). © 2012 Royal Meteorological Society.

84874529053	High-power high beam quality vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers	High-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) can be used as the laser source of laser pumping, laser ranging, and LIDAR, etc. The material structure of VCSEL was rarely optimized directly for high power operation. The deterioration of beam quality of VCSEL caused by large emitting window for high power operation is becoming a key problem for the application of high power VCSEL. Two novel techniques were proposed to improve the performance of VCSEL. The reflectivity of n-DBR was slightly decreased to 99.3% instead of 99.7% as commonly used in conventional VCSEL. A record power of 102 W was realized at a current of 110A for a 500 μm-aperture VCSEL. Output powers of 103 W and 115 W were respectively demonstrated for a 5×5 2D array with the single emitter of 100 μm-aperture and a 8×8 2D array with the single emitter of 140 μm-aperture. For the deterioration of beam quality, microlens were directly integrated onto the emitting window by wet etching the GaAs subatrate. The divergent angle of a 6×6 2D array with the single emitter of 90 μm-aperture was suppressed to 6.6°, indicating a strong improvement compared with the divergent angle of 14.8° for an array without microlens. The results above shows that the performance of high power VCSEL is greatly improved by the optimization of n-DBR reflectivity and the integration of microlens.

The temperature characteristics of the devices were investigated and compared at the temperatures between 20°C and 70°C. Experiments show that the measured characteristic temperature(164 K) of the tapered devices is much higher than that of the broad devices(96 K) and the wavelength-shift coefficients of the tapered and broad-stripe devices are 0.25 nm/K and 0.28 nm/K respectively under a duty cycle of 0.5%(t=50 μs, f=100 Hz) and a pulsed current of 1000 mA. When the temperature is below 50°C, the Full Width at Half Maximums(FWHMs) of the tapered devices and the broad-stripe devices are 1.12 and 1.24 nm, respectively. These results indicate that the tapered lasers have better temperature characteristics than the broad ones with the same epitaxial structure under certain temperature conditions.

The microlens designed as needed was directly fabricated and integrated in one step on the emitting surface of a VCSEL by femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW). By the microlens' shaping the beam quality of VCSELs can be remarkably improved, especially the reduction of the divergence angle. The experiment results agree with the numerical modeling results. After integrating aspherical microlenses the far-field divergence angle of the VCSEL was reduced from 18.16 to 0.83.

84878914994	Fiber coupled diode laser module for laser processing by polarization multiplexing	Single emitter diode laser has better beam quality and longer lifetime as compared with a diode laser bar. However, its application to the material processing is limited by its lower output powers. To improve the output power of the single emitter diode laser, this paper proposed an optical fiber coupling method for single emitter diode lasers based on the polarization multiplexing. Firstly, 16 single emitters were divided into two laser groups, and the laser beam from the two groups was combined into one by spacial multiplexing technology. Then the beam was combined by polarization multiplexing again. Finally, a focusing system developed by ourselves was used to couple the combined beam into an optical fiber to improve the output power of the optical fiber coupling module. Experimental results show that the laser output of the module can reach 67 W from a fiber with a fiber core of 200 μm and a Numerical Aperture (NA) of 0.2 when the working current is 5.8 A. Moreover, the coupling efficiency of the module has reached 84%. This high power LD module can meet the requirements of plastic processing in power and beam quality.

84879824406	A 426-year drought history for Western Tian Shan, Central Asia, inferred from tree rings and linkages to the North Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans	We have reconstructed the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from 1580 to 2005 for Western Tian Shan, Central Asia, using tree rings of Picea schrenkiana. The reconstruction explains 35% of the actual January-May PDSI variance during the common period 1925-2005. Split-sample validation supports our use of the reconstruction model based on the full period of reliable observational data (1925-2005). Spatial climate correlation analyses with gridded PDSI data revealed that our PDSI reconstruction represents a strong regional drought signal for Western Tian Shan. Dry periods occurred during ad 1614-1628, 1700-1722, 1758-1790, 1806-1833, 1873-1898, 1908-1936, 1943-1951, 1960-1966 and 1973-1988; while the periods of ad 1580-1613, 1629-1699, 1723-1757, 1791-1805, 1834-1872, 1899-1907, 1937-1942, 1952-1959, 1967-1972 and 1989-present were relatively wet. Our reconstruction agrees reasonably well with the dry and wet periods previously estimated from tree rings in Tian Shan. Significant spectral peaks are identified at 2-5, 60.2 and 213 years. Our reconstructed drought is significantly correlated with sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans. The linkages to the North Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans suggest the connection of moisture variations of Central Asia to the westerly circulation and tropical ocean-atmosphere systems. © The Author(s) 2013.

84879181013	Gain-cavity mode detuning vertical cavity surface emitting laser operating at the high temperature	The situation of vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) operating at high temperature is analyzed theoretically, and the gain-cavity mode detuning characteristics is employed to design the epitaxy structure of VCSEL. The metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth and fabrication process are carried out. The barrier height above 0.25 eV is used in the active region of VCSEL to reduce the carrier leakage at high temperature. The designed structure employs the 11-nm gain-cavity mode deviation. The highest gain appeares at about 320 K, at which the minimum threshold current of VCSEL appears. The reflectivity of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) within VCSEL is designed to obtain the low threshold current. The self-planar mesa structure is employed to fabricate the VCSEL devices. VCSEL with oxide apertures of 7, 9, 13 μm are fabricated. The threshold currents are 1.95, 2.53, 2.9 mA, respectively, and the corresponding maximum output powers are 0.31, 1.11, 1.04 mW at room temperature. The threshold current decreases first and then increased with the temperature increases, and the minimum value appears at 320-330 K. The measured results consist well with the gain-cavity characteristics of VCSEL.

84880535930	The improved output performance of a broad-area vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser with an optimized electrode diameter	The output performance of a 980-nm broad-area vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) is improved by optimizing the p-electrode diameter in this study. Based on a three-dimensional finite-element method, the current density distribution within the active region of the VCSEL is optimized through the appropriate adjustment of the p-electrode diameter, and uniform current-density distribution is achieved. Then, the effects of this optimization are studied experimentally. The L - I - V characteristics under different temperatures of the VCSELs with different p-electrode diameters are investigated, and better temperature stability is demonstrated in the VCSEL with an optimized p-electrode diameter. The far-field measurements show that with an injected current of 2 A, the far-field divergence angle of the VCSEL with an optimized p-electrode diameter is 9°, which is much lower than the far-field angle of the VCSEL without this optimization. Also the VCSEL with an optimized p-electrode diameter shows a better near-field distribution. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

This reconstruction explains 52.1% of the actual precipitation variance during the period 1951 to 2010. Spatial correlations with gridded land-surface data reveal that our reconstruction contains a strong regional precipitation signal for the Hexi Corridor and for the southern margin of the Badain Jaran Desert. Significant spectral peaks were identified at 31.9, 11.1, 8.0, 7.0, 3.2, 2.6 and 2.2 years. A large-scale comparison indicates that our reconstruction is more consistent with climate records of a Westerly-dominated Central Asia, and that the Westerlies have a greater impact on the precipitation in this region than the Asian summer monsoon. Our reconstructed precipitation series is significantly correlated with sea-surface temperature (SST) in the tropical Atlantic Ocean (positive), the tropical Indian Ocean (positive), the western tropical Pacific Ocean (positive), and the western North Pacific Ocean (negative). The spatial correlation patterns between our precipitation reconstruction and SSTs of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggest a connection between regional precipitation variations and the high-mid-latitude northern atmospheric circulations (Westerlies and Asian summer monsoon). © 2013 The Boreas Collegium.

The reconstruction explains the variance of 47% in the observed mean temperature from 1953 to 2011. Power spectral and wavelet analyses demonstrated the existence of significant 50-year and 2- to 7-year cycles of variability. The results of the spatial correlations suggest that our reconstruction contains climatic signals for Central Asia. Warm periods occurred during 1696-1708, 1730-1748, 1784-1804, 1832-1855, 1892-1903, 1924-1928, 1937-1943, and 1987-2006; while the periods of 1685-1695, 1709-1729, 1749-1783, 1805-1831, 1856-1891, 1904-1923, 1929-1936, and 1944-1986 were relatively cold. The significant correlation coefficient between the reconstruction and the temperature reconstruction for the Urumqi River source reveals that the temperature variations in the annual cold period for the southern and the northern slope of the central Tien Shan Mountains are roughly synchronous over the last nearly 300 years.

First, the relationships among the reflectivity of the n-doped distributed Bragg reflector, threshold current, and output power were analyzed, and the n-DBR reflectivity was optimized to achieve higher slope efficiency in a relatively low threshold current. Second, the influence of the p-contact on the current density distribution inside the active region was analyzed using the three-dimensional finite-element method. Uniform current distribution was achieved by optimizing the diameter of the p-contact, and a consequent improvement in beam divergence was observed. A low divergence of 5.4° was obtained for a single device with continuous-wave (CW) of 1.46 W at room temperature. The 8×8 VCSEL array showed a divergence angle of 10.2° at 4A.

Different incident directions of the photons onto the surface of the metal grating will cause different conditions for coupling surface plasmons. FDTD numerical simulation and optimization were utilized to adjust the optimum compound grating structure and the corresponding parameters. Experimental results show that the unidirectional transmission at the wavelength of 1.5 μm is achieved with a maximum transmission 39% at the selected forward direction and the corresponding transmission contrast rate is up to 9.4.

84891856567	970 nm hundred-watt level diode laser source by spectral beam combining with external cavity feedback	Laser combining is the main way to develop the high power diode laser source. Traditional beam combining is used to increase the power but leads to a poor beam quality. Spectral beam combining with external cavity feedback improves the characteristics of the power and the beam quality by the way of combining diode laser oscillation with external optical system. By spectral beam combining with external cavity feedback based on a transmission grating, a diode laser source is developed with a continuous wave power of 140.6 W, a beam quality of 4.367 mm·mrad and a spectrum width of 36.60 nm. The whole spectrum is composed of 56 independent wavelength peaks, each one of which is only corresponding to one of the combining laser units, respectively. A feasible solution to obtain a good beam quality for high power diode laser source is demonstrated.

84894372283	Mini-bar based diode lasers with high brightness, high power	With the output power of fiber laser increasing, fiber laser pumping module have demonstrated an increased need for higher brightness fiber coupled diode lasers. To enhance the output power of fiber coupled laser diode module further, the fiber coupled method with mini-bar was proposed. In this paper, base on mini-bar architecture, high brightness fiber coupled laser diode module has been developed. The combination of recently designed mini-bar and optimized micro-optics results in fiber coupled laser module with up to 26.2W out of a 200μm fiber with a 0.2 NA and >85% fiber coupling efficiency out of the fiber core, Additionally, this module is demonstrated 20.6W coupled into a 105μm, 0.2 NA fiber with >67% fiber coupling efficiency. These modules address the need in the market for higher brightness diode lasers for pumping fiber lasers. © OSA/SumSession 2011.

84899512561	Phase control of light amplification in steady and transient processes in an inverted-Y atomic system with spontaneously generated coherence	We investigate the effects of spontaneously generated coherence (SGC) on both the steady and transient gain properties in a four-level inverted-Y-type atomic system in the presence of a weak probe, two strong coherent fields, and an incoherent pump. For the steady process, we find that the inversionless gain mainly origins from SGC. In particular, we can modulate the inversionless gain by changing the relative phase between the two fields. Moreover, the amplitude of the gain peak can be enhanced and the additional gain peak can appear by changing the detuning of the coupling field. As for the transient process, the transient gain properties can also be dramatically affected by the SGC. Compared to the case without SGC, the transient gain can be greatly enhanced with completely eliminated transient absorption by choosing the proper relative phase between the two fields. And the inverted-Y-type system with SGC can be simulated in both atomic and semiconductor quantum well systems avoiding the conditions of SGC. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84903649502	High-peak-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser quasi-array realized using optimized large-aperture single emitters	We report on a high-peak-power vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) quasi-array emitting at approximately 980 nm. The quasi-array is composed of four tightly packaged single emitters connected in series. The external quantum efficiency of large-aperture VCSEL was improved by optimizing the current distribution, and single emitters with a 62W peak power were developed as the basic building block of this quasi-array. More than 210W peak power is demonstrated from a ̃2×2 ' 2.2mm2 quasi-array at a current of 110A under 30 ns and 5 kHz pulsed operation. This is the first report on a hundreds-of-watts VCSEL module consisting of single emitters. © 2014 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.

84903711009	Giant Kerr nonlinearity induced by tunneling in triple quantum dot molecules	A scheme for giant enhancement of the Kerr nonlinearity in linear triple quantum dot molecules is proposed. In such a system, the tunneling-induced transparency window obtained in double quantum dot molecules splits into two windows, due to the coupling with the third quantum dot. And most important, the Kerr nonlinearity can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, compared with that generated in double quantum dot molecules. With proper detuning of the tunneling, giant Kerr nonlinearity accompanied by vanishing absorption can be realized, which opens the possibility to enhance self-phase modulation in tunneling controllable semiconductor nanostructures under conditions of low light levels. Quantitative analysis shows that the giant Kerr nonlinearity is attributed to the interacting double dark resonances induced by the tunneling between the triple quantum dots, therefore no extra laser fields are required. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84904043392	A tree-ring based precipitation reconstruction for the Mohe region in the northern Greater Higgnan Mountains, China, since AD 1724	August-July precipitation has been reconstructed back to AD 1724 for the Mohe region in the northern Greater Higgnan Mountains, China, using Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica tree-ring width. The reconstruction explains 39% of the variance in the precipitation observed from AD 1960-2008. Some droughts noted in historical documents are precisely captured in our reconstruction. Wet periods occurred during the periods of AD 1734-1785, AD 1805-1830, AD 1863-1880, AD 1922-1961, and AD 1983-1998; while the periods of AD 1786-1804, AD 1831-1862, AD 1881-1921, and AD 1962-1982 were relatively dry. Power spectral and wavelet analyses demonstrated the existence of significant 24-yr, 12-yr, and 2-yr. cycles of variability. The results of the spatial correlations suggest that our reconstruction contains climatic signals for the southern Stanovoy Range and the northern Greater Higgnan Mountains. The positive correlations between the new reconstructed precipitation series and two precipitation reconstructions indicate that our precipitation reconstruction captures broad-scale regional climatic variations. A comparison between the weakening tendency of summer monsoon and the dry period of our reconstruction reveals that the annual precipitation in the Mohe region is partly influenced by the East Asian Summer Monsoon. © 2014.

84905187009	Tunneling induced dark states and the controllable resonance fluorescence spectrum in quantum dot molecules	Optical spectroscopy, a powerful tool for probing and manipulating quantum dots (QDs), has been used to investigate the resonance fluorescence spectrum from linear triple quantum dot molecules controlled by tunneling, using atomic physics methods. Interesting features such as quenching and narrowing of the fluorescence are observed. In such molecules the tunneling between the quantum dots can also induce a dark state. The results are explained by the transition properties of the dressed states generated by the coupling of the laser and the tunneling. Unlike the atomic system, in such quantum dot molecules quantum coherence can be induced using tunneling, requiring no coupling lasers, which will allow tunneling controllable quantum dot molecules to be applied to quantum optics and photonics. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84905681841	Tree-ring based temperature reconstruction for the west qinling mountains (china): Linkages to the high asia, solar activity and pacific-atlantic ocean	We developed a Faxon fir (Abies faxoniana) tree-ring width chronology at the timberline in the western Qinling Mountains, China. Herein February-July mean temperature was reconstructed for Zhouqu in the western Qinling Mountains back to AD 1650 based on the standard chronology. The climate/tree-growth model accounts for 43.5% of the instrumental temperature variance during the period 1972-2006. Spatial correlation analyses with the gridded temperature data shows that the tem-perature reconstruction captures regional climatic variations over central and southeast China, and strong teleconnections with the nearby High Asia. There is a good agreement with cold and warm pe-riods previously estimated from tree-rings in Nepal, India and southwest China. The temperature re-construction indicates that there was pronounced cooling in Zhouqu during the Maunder Minimum (late 1600s to early 1700s). The cold period (1813-1827) of the temperature reconstruction coincide with the volcanic eruptions. Significant spectral peaks are found at 56.9, 22.3, 11.4, 2.9, 2.8, 2.6, 2.2 and 2.0 years. The spatial correlation patterns between our temperature reconstruction and SSTs of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans suggest a connection between regional temperature variations and the atmospheric circulations. It is thus revealed that the chronology has enough potential to reconstruct the climatic variability further into the past. © 2013 Silesian University of Technology.

84906732723	A tree-ring based drought reconstruction (AD 1760-2010) for the Loess Plateau and its possible driving mechanisms	We have developed a 272-year ring-width chronology of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) growing in the Huanglong Mountains, North China. Climatic response analyses revealed that mean January-July Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) has positive effect on the radial growth of pine trees. Based on the relationships, the mean January-July PDSI was reconstructed for the period from 1760 to 2010. The percentage of variance in the data explained by the reconstruction was 41% during the calibration period of 1950-2010. Spatial correlation analyses between the PDSI reconstruction and gridded PDSI data show that the PDSI reconstruction captures regional drought variations over the environmentally-sensitive area linked to the East Asian summer monsoon. Relatively wet periods are identified for AD 1766-1781, 1795-1804, 1811-1821, 1838-1859, 1884-1889, 1909-1914, 1937-1977 and 2003-2008. Dry conditions prevailed during AD 1760-1765, 1782-1794, 1805-1810, 1822-1837, 1860-1883, 1890-1908, 1915-1936, 1978-2002 and 2009-now. There is a reasonable agreement with dry/wet periods previously estimated from tree-ring data of the Kongtong Mountains of the Loess Plateau. Spatial correlation analyses with sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean and tropical Indian Ocean indicated that the Asian summer monsoon circulations play a role in modulating drought variations in the study area whereas the effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation are relatively strong. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84919782732	Research on the spatial coherent characteristics of high power VCSEL	The spatial coherence properties of high power vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are studied based on the theorem of partially coherent light proposed by Van Cittert-Zernike. The interference stripe patterns are gauged using the Young's double-slit experiment for the devices of 980 nm wavelength VCSEL single emitters. Then interference patterns are switched to grayscale by intensity distribution patterns for data collection. In this paper, the integral average value method is proposed to calculate the degree of spatial coherence. The proposed integral average value method and traditional average method are used respectively to calculate the light intensity of the pattern. The results are compared with those calculated by the theoretical value of Van Cittert-Zernike theorem. The VCSEL optical apertures' influence on coherent characteristics are also discussed. The experimental results show that, a relative error within 2.5%~9.4% is reached by our integral average value method. On the contrary, a relative error of 7.5%~67.4% are got from the traditional average method. Apparently, traditional average value method causes the error generally 1.5~27 times worse than our integral average value method. Moreover, for single emitter VCSELs with optical aperture from 200 μm to 500 μm, the smaller the optical aperture are, the larger the coherent degrees (between 0.731~0.426) are. The conclusion can be wildly used on theoretical and experimental design for VCSEL coherent arrays.

84919798358	Rectangular mesa shaped vertical cavity surface emitting laser with shallow surface relief	In order to realize the high-power narrow linewidth of vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), the shallow surface relief rectangular structure (SR VCSEL) is designed. The difference of the current density distribution leads to the mode distribution different. Calculation results show that, compared with circular mesa VCSEL, the uniformity of the current density distribution of rectangular mesa VCSEL is not changed when the active area is increased. And theoretical results indicate that the threshold gain of high-order mode increases greater than that of the fundamental mode when etching shallow relief of surface. In the experiment, the power of 5.87 mW when current is continuous, spectral width of 0.1 nm, power polarization degree of 10, and transverse mode suppression ratio more than 30 dB are obtained.
