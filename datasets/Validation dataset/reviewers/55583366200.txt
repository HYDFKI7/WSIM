22744442448	Regional modulation of primary motor cortex after peripheral nerve injury: A functional magnetic resonance imaging study	Objective: To map dynamic changes of primary motor cortex after total brachial plexus traction injury by using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and to explore underlying probable mechanisms. Methods: Five patients with total traumatic root avulsions of the brachial plexus underwent varied kinds of nerve transfer to restore partially shoulder or elbow function. Four of them (cases 1,3,4,5) accepted the first fMRI examination prior to surgery treatment, and four of them (cases 2,3,4,5) accepted second or third or fourth fMRI follow-up re-examinations after surgery treatment. Maps of neuronal activation within the motor cortex were generated for both hands in each patient by using BOLD-fMRI and the cluster size and position were recorded. The motor tasks consisted of simple hand grasping of both hands respectively. Patients with paralytic hand were asked to complete task under "virtual" condition. The cluster size and intensity as well as location of motor activation within the primary motor cortex of the affected hand generated were compared with those of unaffected hand generated as reference in single subject, and the resultant maps of follow-up re-examinations were also compared with those of the prior examinations. Results: All patients' unaffected hand movement generated strong signal change within the contralateral primary motor cortex. In contrast, the clusters generated by affected hand showed very small and lower intensity than usual (2 cases) or could not be induced (2 case) in the first examination that prior to surgery treatment and seemed larger gradually in the following re-examination with time increasing. Conclusion: Peripheral nerve injury can produced significant changes in the motor cortex of human brain, fMRI is a valuable tool to evaluate neural plasticity in motor cortex after peripheral nerve injury.

33744823286	The establishment of rat glioma model for MRI study	Objective: To establish a rat model of glioma for MRI study. Methods: Fischer 344 rats were inoculated with F98 glioma cells in caudate nucleus by stereotaxic procedure. MRI scanning and pathology examination were performed to observe the tumor growth on 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d, respectively, after inoculation and their survival was also analyzed. Results: After inoculation, tumors were found in all rats by MRI as early as 6 days. Most of rats died on 14 d after inoculation. The volume of tumor increased as the inoculation time lengthened. The tumor volume measured by MRI was larger than actual size by autopsy, but the both correlated positively (r = 0. 91, P < 0. 01). The tumor had pathological features of glioma. Conclusion: The animal model of glioma with high and rapid tumorigenesis is an ideal model for MRI study characterized by prospectability and repeatability, and its perfect study duration is between 10 and 14 days after inoculation of tumor cells.

33750739286	Magnetic resonance imaging characteristics with pathological correlation of cavernous malformation in cavernous sinus	OBJECTIVE: To analyze extracerebral cavernous malformation located in the cavernous sinus and correlate their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to pathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients (5 men and 14 women; mean age, 50.6 years; range, 32-71 years) with surgically verified cavernous malformations in the cavernous sinus were reviewed. MRI including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and postcontrasted T1-weighted imaging was carried out in all instances with a 1.5-T superconductive system (Signa; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI). RESULTS: All these lesions measured from 2.5 cm to 6 cm (average, 4.3 cm) with 13 lesions located to the right side and 6 to the left side. Magnetic resonance images showed that 18 cases were hypointense to white matter on T1-weighted images with only one case showed mixed hypointensity and hyperintensity. On T2-weighted images, 17 cases showed marked homogeneous hyperintensity, 1 case showed marked hyperintensity with some signal void structures and 1 with mixed intensity. Marked homogeneous enhancement after contrast material administration was found in 7 cases, and the remaining 12 showed marked heterogeneous enhancement. Pathologically, these lesions can be classified as type A, type B, and type C. Type A was sponge-like with intact pseudocapsule; type B was mulberry-like with the pseudocapsule incomplete or absent; and type C was composed of both mulberry-like composition and sponge-like composition. Lesions with homogeneous contrast enhancement on MRI correlated with type A pathological findings, whereas those with heterogeneous enhancement correlated with type B and type C pathological findings. Asymmetrical dumbbell-shaped masses of 13 cases involving the sellar and round masses of 6 cases with 2 protruding into the sellar were found. All of the cavernous malformations displaced the adjacent temporal lobe without adjacent brain edema. The internal carotid arteries were displaced or encased in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: If a well-demarcated, homogeneous high signal intensity lesion on T2-weighted images with a dumbbell configuration involving both parasellar and sellar regions with marked heterogeneous or homogeneous enhancement is found, the diagnosis of cavernous sinus cavernous malformation should be entertained. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

33846383025	Characteristic magnetic resonance enhancement pattern in cerebral schistosomiasis	Objective: To describe the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of cerebral schistosomiasis. Methods: Twenty-five patients whose diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) schistosomiasis had been pathologically (n = 8) and clinically (n = 17) confirmed were randomly selected. MRI was performed on a Signal 1.5T MRI scanner before and after the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine constrast medium. We reviewed the MRI studies obtained at the time of initial presentation, as well as follow-up studies obtained during and after medical treatment. Results: Immunological tests in 15 patients indicated schistosomiasis haematobium. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images in 22 cases showed central linear enhancement surrounded by multiple enhancing punctate nodules, which appeared "arborized". Through operation and pathological examination, 8 cases had the granuloma formation of schistosomal eggs extensive surrounded by inflammation and venous congestion. And 17 cases were treated with praziquantel and corticosteroid therapy. And they were followed up for 2 months by taking MRI, which turned out to be complete resolution of the enhancing structure and edema. At follow-up, all the patients' initial symptoms also resolved. Conclusion: The specified MRI enhancement pattern of cerebral schistosomiasis is common in most cases of CNS schistosomiasis, so it should be taken account into the diagnosis of cerebral schistosomiasis.

33947714250	MR imaging evaluation of ductal carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ with small invasive foci of breast	Objective: To retrospectively assess diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in preoperative assessment of local extent of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and DCIS with small invasive foci, compared with the mammography and ultrasonography (US) imagings. Methods: Results of MRI, mammography, and US imaging from 17 consecutive women with known breast DCIS and DCIS with invasive foci were analyzed, and then compared with pathologic examination. Results: (1) Fourteen lesions showed enhancement on dynamic breast MRI, of which 11 lesions were no-mass-like enhancement. Six of 11 lesions appeared segmental enhancement, and 2 were regional enhancement. Ductal and multiple focal areas enhancement were 1 case respectively. Symmetric diffuse enhancement in bilateral breast was showed in 1 patient. Ductal dilation was visible in ipsilateral breast on pre-contrast MRI in 2 cases, which manifested bloody nipple discharge in clinical examination, and duct enhanced on post-contrast imaging in one of them. Two lesions appeared mass enhancement with irregular shape and homogeneous signal. Linear enhancement surrounding the oval homogeneous mass with smooth margin found in 1 case. (2) Thirteen of 17 patients underwent bilateral mammography. There were various findings in mammograms, including microcalcifcations (6 cases), normal mammograms (2 cases), calcifications with other appearance (2 cases), and non-calcification abnormity (3 cases). In 8 lesions with calcifications, 5 were noted higher probability of malignancy calcifications and 3 intermediate concern calcifications. Calcifications distributed clustered (5 cases), regional (2 cases) and diffuse (1 case) shape. (3) Sixteen of 17 patients were performed breast US examination. Eleven lesions, which were correct diagnosed, appeared higher echo spots within irregular lower echo area. One lesion diagnosed benign and 4 were negative on US examination. (4) Regarded the size measured on pathologic examination as golden standard, accordance of lesion extent was 13 of 17 case in MRI, 7 of 13 in mammography, and 7 of 16 in US. There were 2 lesions overestimation of extent in MRI, 3 in mammography, and 2 in US. Underestimation of extent showed 1 case and 3 cases in mammography and US imaging respectively. The difference was not significant (P = 0.161). Conclusion: The MR imaging features of DCIS and DCIS with small invasive foci were characteristic. The combination of MRI and mammography could improve diagnostic accuracy.

34250700044	Evaluation of enhanced ultrasonography for hepatic carcinoma with cryosurgery	Objective: To evaluate the role of enhanced ultrasonography in assessing the short term therapeutic response of hepatic carcinoma with cryosurgery. Methods: Twenty three patients with 26 lesions were enrolled in the study with contrast agent SonoVue and CPS software technology for evaluation the therapeutic response in all the patients one week and three months after cryosurgery. Simultaneously, all patients underwent routine US, CT and MRI for comparison. Results: After cryosurgery, twenty lesions showed no enhancement within entire procedural periods, which indicated complete necrosis. Five lesions showed local enhancement in arterial phase suggesting tumor residue and another as the suspected. Eleven new lesions were found by enhanced ultrasonography with eight more than offered by conventional ultrasonography, including six smaller than 10 mm in diameter and another small recurrent lesion was not demonstrated. According to the final diagnosis as gold standard, the accuracy was 96.1% for enhanced ultrasonography, which was equivalent to the enhanced CT or MRI. Conclusions: Enhanced ultrasonography can accurately differentiate tumor necrosis and evaluate therapeutic efficacy of cryosurgery. It is also useful to identify minute foci early after the ablation.

36749050317	Intracranial ganglioglioma: clinicopathological and MRI findings in 16 patients	Aim: To record the clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of intracranial gangliogliomas in 16 patients. Materials and methods: Sixteen patients were imaged using unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI. Eight patients underwent unenhanced CT and of these, three underwent contrast-enhanced CT. Two radiologists read the images retrospectively. The images were studied with regard to location, size, margin, signal intensity, enhancement characteristics, cystic changes, and presence of calcifications. Clinical data, such as presenting signs and symptoms, physical findings, and medical histories, were collected. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed and analysed by two pathologists. Results: In 12 cases the tumours were located in one of the cerebral hemispheres; in the other cases they were located in the brainstem, cerebellum, suprasellar area or the thalamus. The tumour dimension varied from 1-7 cm, with a mean of 3.6 cm ± 1.8 cm. The MRI features of ganglioglioma in the present cohort can be divided into three patterns: cystic (n = 2), cystic-solid (n = 6), and solid (n = 8). Solid lesions had a predilection for the temporal lobe; cystic and cystic-solid tumours had a wide anatomical distribution. Cystic lesions were significantly smaller than both cystic-solid and solid lesions (F = 4.28, P < 0.05). Cystic changes in the cystic-solid tumours showed one of the following patterns: those with walls showing contrast enhancement, those containing an enhancing nodule, or cysts without an obvious wall. The solid portion of cystic-solid gangliogliomas and the entire tumour in solid tumours showed homogeneous enhancement of variable degrees on T1-weighted (T1W) spin-echo (SE) images. Five tumours had mild or moderate oedema. In one patient two separate gangliogliomas were found, each lesion exhibiting different MRI features: solid and cystic-solid. One case of cortical ganglioglioma was found, causing bone erosion due to pressure. One tumour with chronic haemorrhage was found in the study. Conclusion: MRI features of gangliogliomas are non-specific. A ganglioglioma should be suspected when a tumour shows the following features: (1) a solid lesion located in the temporal lobes with mild or no oedema and homogeneous enhancement on SE T1W images; or (2) a small cystic lesion or cystic-solid mixed mass with a wall enhancement or a markedly enhanced nodule. We report a patient with two separate gangliogliomas and a case with bone erosion. © 2007 The Royal College of Radiologists.

36849010241	Magnetic resonance angiography of carotid and cerebral arterial occlusion in rats using a clinical scanner	In rat models to induce both focal cerebral ischemia and chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, it is highly desirable to verify the success of vessel occlusion and reopening with non-invasive method. The contrast-agent free 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging by 3.0-T MR clinical scanner were applied when unilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded and reopened, and after bilateral common carotid arteries were in ligation. The arterial angiograms of the rat brain and neck were achieved successfully in all chosen directions by the 3D TOF-MRA. It was shown that MCA in occlusion presented no signal in MRA, and the parenchyma of the ipsilateral MCA territory hypointensity signal in maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). After reperfusion, the signal intensity of ipsilateral MCA was resumed in MRA, and the decreased ADC was restored simultaneously. However, after 5 h of reperfusion, it was found that the value of ADC deteriorated second time with high T2 value. In bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) rats, it can be confirmed by MRA that the effectively occluded BCCA presented the absent signal and the basilar artery became tortuous. As a result, MRA by clinical scanner was proved of a valuable method to validate transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and permanent BCCAO rat model. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

32044464563	Functional reorganization of human motor cortex after unaffected side C7 nerve root transposition	Objective: To assess the characteristics of neuronal activity in human motor cortex after the seventh cervical nerve root transposition of the unaffected side by using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Thirteen patients who accepted the seventh cervical nerve root transposition of the unaffected side, due to total brachial plexus traction injury diagnosed by manifestation and operation, were examined retrospectively by using fMRI. 10 patients were injured on the left side and 3 on the right side. According to functional recovery of the affected hand, all subjects can be divided into 2 groups. The patients of the first group could not move the affected hand voluntarily. The patients of the second group could move the affected hand self-determined. 12 healthy volunteers were also involved in this study as control. The fMRI examinations were performed by using echo-planer BOLD sequence. Then the SPM 99 software was used for post-processing. Results: The neuronal activation induced by the movement of both unaffected and affected upper limb was seen in the contralateral PMC in all patients; Neuronal activation in the ipsilateral PMC evoked by movement of the unaffected extremity was seen in 10 cases, and induced by movement of the affected limb was seen in 7 cases. In the first group, the sharp of clusters in the contralateral PMC resulted by movement of the unaffected extremity showed normal in 9 cases, the average size of clusters resulted by the unafected hand was 3159 (voxel), and resulted by the unafected shoulder was 1746(voxel). The sharp of clusters in the contralateral PMC resulted by the affected shoulder or hand were revealed enlargement in 6 cases of each. In the second group, 1 case showed neuronal activation induced by movement of the affected limb in the PMC in both sides of motor cortex, and 2 cases showed neuronal activation in the contralateral PMC. Conclusions: Peripheral nerve injury was able to cause changes of motor cortex in human brain. Cortical area devoted to the affected extremity seems to persist for a long time with response to mental representation of movement. The functional reorganization of central nerve system may be present in several levels of the central nerve system and may be affected by multiple factors.

33344456596	Somatotopic mapping of the human primary motor cortex measured with functional MRI	Objective: To test the capability of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mapping the somatotopic organization in the primary motor cortex. Methods: Self-paced repetitive simple movements of the upper extremity were performed by 12 healthy volunteers. The raw data were acquired by using echo-planer BOLD sequence. Then, the SPM 99 software was used for post processing. The position of the most significant voxel of active area of the Talairach coordinates in the primary motor cortex was recorded and the Statistic analysis of variance was used for X, Y and Z value. Results: Statistically significant MR signal changes were observed within contralateral primary motor cortex in all subjects and movement conditions. The pattern of functional activity followed a topographic representation. Statistic analysis indicated that there was significant difference among hand, elbow and shoulder movement in X value. The Z value between hand and shoulder also showed significant difference. Conclusion: These findings indicate that fMRI is capable of generating somatotopic maps in the primary motor cortex in individual subjects.

33644939185	Central neurocytoma: Clinical, pathological and neuroradiological findings	Aim: To evaluate the clinical, pathological and neuroradiological features of intraventricular central neurocytoma in six patients. Materials and Methods: Six patients were imaged using non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); three of them were also examined using non-enhanced computed tomography (CT). Two radiologists read the images retrospectively. The imaging data were studied with regard to location, size, margin, signal intensity, enhancement characteristics and presence of calcifications. Clinical data (i.e. presenting signs and symptoms, physical findings and medical histories) were collected and histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were performed by two pathologists. Results: All lesions were located in the lateral ventricles. Three tumors were confined to the left side, one to the right side and two cases involved both lateral ventricles. The growth of central neurocytoma was of close spatial relation to the septum pellucidum. On MRI, most of the cases showed a heterogeneous hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images or FLAIR with a well-defined margin. The presence of cystic components, necroses and calcifications caused these internal heterogeneities. After intravenous administration of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA) all tumours showed a heterogeneous enhancement. CT provided additional information by distinguishing intratumoural calcifications in all three evaluated cases. Immunohistochemical analysis showed positive synaptophysin staining in all cases and positive neuron-specific enolase staining in four cases. In three cases a small proportion of the tumour cells could be labelled with antibodies to glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP). Conclusion: Central neurocytoma should be considered when the following conditions occur: Young patients with lesions in the lateral ventricle, which contain calcifications and show some enhancement. This is especially applicable for tumours involving both lateral ventricles with symmetrical growth around the centre of septum pellucidum or for unilateral ventricular tumors with a wide base attachment to the septum pellucidum. © 2006 The Royal College of Radiologists.

60549087146	In vitro and in vivo MR imaging of rat pancreatic islet cells	Objective: To track SPIO-labeled cells using MRI in vitro and in vivo, in order to find appropriate parameters and sequence. Methods: Pancreatic islet cells of rat were labeled with SPIO combined with PLL by means of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and were scanned on a GE 3.0T Signa Excite MR scanner equipped with an animal coil for a standard T2* - weighted gradient echo sequence. The images of SPIO-labeled cells were compared with that of the unlabeled. Two scan protocols with different resolutions were used to scan the labeled cells. SPIO-labeled and unlabeled cells were transplanted into the rats' liver respectively, and their MR images were compared. FSE T2WI sequence and GRE T2* WI sequence were used to scan the SPIO-labeled cells, and the sensitivity of images was compared. Results: Only SPIO-labeled pancreatic islet cells were seen on MRI as distinct hypointense spots both in vitro and in vivo. The SPIO-labeled pancreatic islet cells could be more clearly seen on higher resolution images. GRE T2* WI was more sensitive on the detection of SPIO than FSE T2WI. Conclusion: MRI can be used to track SPIO-labeled islet cells both in vitro and in vivo, and provide great value to detect the survival status and rejection of grafts after transplantation.

84861605876	Comparison of CT perfusion parameters and microvessel density in intracranial hemangiopericytomas with peritumoral edema	Purpose. Intracranial hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) are rare, and they have a tendency for local recurrence and metastases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between CT perfusion (CTP) parameters and microvessel density (MVD) of HPCs and compare CTP parameters in parenchyma and peritumoral edema of HPCs. Materials and methods. The study was approved by the ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained. Ten patients with HPCs and peritumoral edema, confirmed by pathological results, received 64-slice CT perfusion imaging before operation. To evaluate vascular attenuation of tumoral parenchyma, we immunostained the specimen sections for CD-34, measured the integrated optical density of all the positive stained CD-34 cells in the microscopic field, and calculated its ratio to total area of field as MVD. Perfusion analysis was calculated using the Patlak method. Using a 1-cm distance from the outer enhancing tumor margin as a boundary, the peritumoral edema was divided into an immediate and a distant part. The quantitative CTP parameters, including cerebral blood volume (CBV), permeability-surface area product (PS) of parenchyma, and immediate and distant peritumoral edemas, were compared. CBV and PS in parenchyma and immediate and distant peritumoral edemas of HPCs were also compared to their respective contralateral normal white matter. The correlations between MVD, CBV, and PS of tumoral parenchyma were analyzed. Results. Positive correlations existed between CBV and MVD, PS and MVD (P < 0.05) respectively in the 10 patients. Furthermore, the values of CBV and PS in parenchyma of HPCs were significantly higher than those of the contralateral normal white matter and peritumoral edema (P < 0.05). The value of CBV in peritumoral edema of HPCs were lower than that of contralateral normal white matter (P < 0.05), while the value of PS in immediate and distant peritumoral edemas of HPCs were not significantly difference with that of contralateral normal white matter (P > 0.05). Finally, the values of CBV and PS did not show a significant difference between immediate and distant peritumoral edemas. Conclusions. CT perfusion imaging, especially determination of maximal CBV and corresponding PS values in the parenchyma, may be a useful and non-invasive technique for the preoperative evaluation of hemodynamic features of HPCs with peritumoral edema. CBV of peritumoral edema indicate that HPCs have a possibility of infiltration, this need further radiological-pathological research. © 2012 The Neurosurgical Foundation.

84877119922	Changes of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between motor cortices after brachial plexuses injury: A resting-state fMRI study	Object: The aim of this study is to explore the changes of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury. Methods: Nine patients with five roots of unilateral brachial plexus avulsion injury and 11 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance image was used to study the differences of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between patients and healthy controls. Four areas were defined as regions of interest (ROI): the two primary motor areas (M1 areas) and two supplementary motor areas (SMAs) in the two hemispheres activated when the healthy controls performed unilateral hand grasping movement of the two hands, respectively. Functional connectivity maps were generated by correlating the regional time course of each ROI with that of every voxel in the whole brain. Then, functional connectivity was calculated by correlating the functional magnetic resonance image signal time courses of every two ROIs. Results: Resting-state inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the primary motor areas was reduced following brachial plexus avulsion injury. The correlation coefficients of the SMAs showed no difference between the brachial plexus patients and healthy volunteers. Conclusions: Our results indicate that brachial plexus injury decreases resting-state inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the two primary motor areas. These results provide new insight into functional reorganization of the cerebral cortex after brachial plexus injury. © 2013 IBRO.

84877151999	Central neurocytoma: Radiological and clinico-pathological findings in 18 patients and one additional MRS case	Objectives: To evaluate clinical findings and radiological characteristics of central neurocytoma (CN) in 18. patients and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) features in one additional case. Materials and methods: Clinical and imaging findings of 18. patients (nine female and nine male; age range, 18-37 years old (27.8±5.7)) with histopathological diagnosis of CN were evaluated retrospectively. Eight patients underwent CT and eight had MR imaging. Both MR and CT images were acquired for other two patients. We also assessed the tumour NADC values. Clinical data, such as presenting symptoms and medical histories were collected. MRS was also obtained for one additional case. Results: Clinical symptoms at the time of presentation were headaches (n=11), dizziness (n=6), visual disturbances (n=2), etc. Eight lesions were unilateral ventricle (44%) and ten were located in both lateral ventricles. Three tumours continued towards the foramen of Monro and one to the third ventricle. The maximum diameter of the CNs varied from 3.4 to 9.2. cm (5.2±1.5 cm). On CT, diffuse and diverse calcifications were observed in nine cases and cysts varying in sizes were revealed in all. On MRI, the solid parts of the tumours were mainly hypo- to isointense on all T1WI and isointense to grey matter on T2WI. Clusters of cysts gave the tumours a " swiss cheese/soap bubble" inhomogeneous hyperintense appearance on T2WI and FLAIR images. Heterogeneous moderate enhancement (5/8) was present on T1 postcontrast images. On DWI, the tumours had heterogeneous hyperintense appearances and the tumour NADC values were 0.93±0.21.On MRS, elevated Cho and Gly peaks and reduced Cr and NAA peaks were obtained. Conclusion: CN is almost exclusively located in the body of lateral ventricle in young adults. It is discovered due to symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The distinct radiological features such as: (1) diffuse and diverse calcifications on CT images; (2) clusters of cysts of varying sizes resulting in the " swiss cheese/soap bubble" appearance on T2WI and heterogeneous moderate enhancement on MR images; (3) the incorporation of the septum pellucidum in bilateral tumours and abutting of the septum pellucidum in unilateral tumours together with the attachment of the wall of the ventricles can help in the diagnosis of preoperative central neurocytoma. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

43049132904	Neuronal specificity of needling acupoints at same meridian: A control functional magnetic resonance imaging study with electroacupuncture	The purpose of this study was to investigate the neuronal specificity of needling acupoints at same meridian by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The selected acupoints GB34 (Yanglinquan) and GB39 (Xuanzhong) were at the same gallbladder meridian based on traditional Chinese medicine. In our study we devise three distinct EA (electroacupuncture) manipulations: real EA (deep needling at acupoints), sham EA (deep needling at no-meridian points) and shallow EA (subcutaneous needling at acupoints). Twelve healthy volunteers with right-handiness were enrolled and received three different EA manipulations in counter-balanced orders. DeQi scores were used to evaluate the degree of needling sensation. We found real EA can induce significant stronger needling sensation than sham EA and shallow EA. Multisubjects group mean analysis showed that pain-related cortex including primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (SI and SII), anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), insula were involved in three EA stimulation. Bilateral activation of prefrontal gyrus and occipital cortex were exclusively found in real EA. Deactivation over the rostral segment of ACC was also shown in real and shallow EA. Further paired two difference analysis indicated that real EA induced higher activation than sham EA over bilateral prefrontal gyrus, right-side occipital gyrus and deactivation over the rostral segment of ACC. In the comparing with real EA versus shallow EA, there was right-side activation over the SI , S II , motor cortex, ACC, insula, thalamus, hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum; also activation over bilateral prefrontal gyrus, caudate and pons. Although no significant activation was found over periaqueductal gray (PAG), further analysis showed the mean and maximal signal changes were different under three EA manipulations. We concluded that EA at analgesic acupoints of same meridian maybe involved the pain-related neuromatrix especially the hypothalamus-limbic system; deep EA at meridian points could elicit stronger needling sensation and modulate the pain-related neuromatrix more effectively than EA at nonmeridian points or shallow EA at meridian points.

63649105680	MR imaging of tumor angiogenesis using sterically stabilized Gd-DTPA liposomes targeted to CD105	Aim: To depict tumor angiogenesis via the expression of CD105 in tumor-bearing rats using Gd-DTPA liposomes targeted to CD105 (CD105-Gd-SLs) on MR imaging. Materials and methods: Three Gd-DTPA liposomal nanoparticles were prepared in our trial: liposomes entrapping Gd-DTPA (Gd-SLs), Gd-SLs conjugated to immunoglobulins (IgG-Gd-SLs) and CD105-Gd-SLs. Forty glioma-bearing rats were randomized into four groups: (a) Gd-DTPA; (b) Gd-SLs; (c) IgG-Gd-SLs; (d) CD105-Gd-SLs. Axial T1WI MRI images were collected at baseline and repeated at 5, 30, 60 and 120 min post-intravenous injection of Gd-DTPA or liposome. Enhancement features and contrast-to-noise ratio of each group were analyzed. After imaging, tumors were resected for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining to assess vascularity and angiogenesis. Results: The four groups showed different enhancement features. The enhancement area was restricted for group CD105-Gd-SLs, while diffused for the other three. The degree of enhancement over time varied: group Gd-DTPA showed an early contrast enhancement at instant after injection with a peak at 30 min and a decline to baseline values at 60 min. In group CD105-Gd-SLs, the signal intensity (SI) continuously increased over 120 min. In groups IgG-Gd-SLs and Gd-SLs the SI peaked at 60 min, followed by a minor decrease for IgG-Gd-SLs and a rapid decrease for Gd-SLs almost to baseline. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that the enhancement in the CD105-Gd-SLs group resulted mainly from new microvessels. While in the other three groups, mature microvessels and new microvasculature resulted in the enhancement of the tumor. Conclusion: CD105-Gd-SLs can be used to detect early tumor angiogenesis on MR images. This might provide a means to non-invasively reveal a malignant phenotype of extracerebral F98 tumor and evaluate its progression. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

67649607494	MRI findings of intracranial cystic meningiomas	Aim: To report the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of intracranial cystic meningiomas and compare these features in intra- and peritumoural cyst groups. Materials and methods: Fourteen cases of peritumoural cystic meningiomas were compared with 18 cases of intratumoural cystic meningiomas. All patients were examined using non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI. Tumour location, tumour size, signal intensity, enhancement characteristics, and cystic changes were assessed. The MRI features were compared between the intra- and peritumoural cyst groups. Results: Most cystic meningiomas comprised two or more cysts. The solid parts of the tumours showed moderate or marked enhancement after the injection of contrast material. An enhanced cyst wall was found in six out of 14 cases in the peritumoural cyst group, but not in the intratumoural cyst group. Peritumoural cystic meningiomas were predominately located in the cerebral falx, whereas the intratumoural cystic meningiomas were predominantly found in frontal convexity (X

70349744236	Computed tomography and magnetic resonance appearance of sporadic meningioangiomatosis correlated with pathological findings	PURPOSE: Meningioangiomatosis (MA) is a rare benign localized lesion of leptomeninges and underlying cerebral cortex. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult and challenging because of its diverse clinical, pathological, and imaging features. We retrospectively analyzed 7 cases of MA to explore their imaging features and correlate with pathological findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging studies including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively reviewed in 7 patients with surgically and pathologically verified intracranial MA (not associated with neurofibromatosis). Computed tomography studies were performed in axial plane without iodinated contrast-material administration; magnetic resonance studies consisted of axial T1-weighted, T2-weighted, Fluid attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR), and postcontrast T1-weighted sequences and coronal or sagittal precontrast and postcontrast T1-weighted sequences. RESULTS: Computed tomography showed focal extensively calcified lesions in 3 cases, lesions with patchy calcification in 2 cases, and no apparent calcification in 2 cases. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated predominantly hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Six of 7 cases exhibited gyriform hyperintensity on FLAIR sequences, which correlated with proliferating microvessels with perivascular cuffs of spindle-cell proliferation within the cortex on histopathological analysis. After contrast-material administration, all but 1 showed heterogeneous enhancement. The nonenhancing lesion on MRI was completely calcified on CT. CONCLUSION: Gyriform hyperintensity on FLAIR sequence is the main MRI feature of MA, which correlates with proliferating microvessels with perivascular cuffs of spindle-cell proliferation within the cortex on pathological analysis. Plain CT scan is essential to demonstrate the extent of calcification of these lesions. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

70350117963	Non-hodgkin's lymphoma of supraclavicular lymph nodes can mimic metastasis of breast cancer during chemotherapy on FDG PET/CT	A 43-year-old woman who had a history of right mastectomy for breast cancer presented with fever and swelling in the right supraclavicular region during her second course of chemotherapy. An FDG PET/CT was performed to evaluate this patient, which revealed mildly increased FDG activity in the lymph node in the supraclavicular region. A metastatic lesion from the known breast cancer was considered. However, biopsy results demonstrated that the abnormal activity in the right supraclavicular region is due to T-cell lymphoma. © 2009 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

72849115361	Tracking transplanted pancreatic islet cells in rats using magnetic resonance imaging	Objective To track superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled pancreatic islet cells in rats using 3. OT magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to detect the survival and rejection of grafts after transplantation. Methods Twenty male Wistar rats and 5 male Lewis rats were included in the study. SPIO-labeled pancreatic islet cells were tracked using a GE 3. OT Signa Excite MRI scanner with an animal coil. The images of SPIO-labeled islet cells in rats after transplantation were compared with those of the unlabeled ones. FSE T2WI sequence and GRE T2 * WI sequence were used for the detection. The sensitivity of images for detection of grafts was also compared. SPIO-labeled pancreatic islet cells isolated from Wistar and Lewis rats were transplanted into the liver of Wistar rats. Afterwards i the survival and rejection of islet cells were observed sequentially in these two growps. The rats in the syngeneic group were sacrificed 3 months post-transplantation, while the rats in the allogeneic group were sacrificed 3 weeks post-transplantation. MRI of the grafts were correlated with the pathological results. Results SPIO-labeled pancreatic islet cells were seen on MRI as distinct homogenous) hypointense spots in the liver. GRE T2 * WI were more sensitive to the detection of SPIO-labeled islet cells than FSE T2WI. The relative count of hypointense spots in the syngeneic group were (90.03 ± 9.52)%, (92.87 ± 18.20% and (86.25 ± 24.81)%, respectively at 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks after transplantation, while the relative count in the allogeneic group were (41.40 ± 15.40%, (33.41 ± 14.01)% and (23.58 ± 16.78)%, respectively. The difference between these counts was statistically significant (P<0.01). Iron particles were detected only in the SPIO-labeled cells. Three months post-transplantation, the grafts were found well-preserved in the liver of the rats of the syngeneic group, while only a few grafts were found in that of the allogeneic group. Conclusions MRI can be used to track SPIO-labeled islet cells in vivo, and has significant value in detecting the survival and rejection of grafts after transplantation in rats.

71849099731	Rathke's cleft cyst: clinicopathological and MRI findings in 22 patients	AIM: To evaluate clinical findings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of Rathke's cleft cyst (RCC) in 22 patients. Materials and Methods: Twenty-two patients were imaged using non-enhanced MRI and 17 underwent an additional contrast-enhanced MRI examination. Fifteen patients received an additional non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination, and amongst these, two underwent contrast-enhanced CT. Two radiologists read the images retrospectively. The imaging data were studied with regards to location, size, margin, signal intensity, enhancement characteristics, haemorrhage, and presence of calcifications. Clinical data, such as presenting signs and symptoms, physical findings, and medical histories, were collected. Histopathological studies were performed and analysed by two pathologists. Results: Nine lesions were located in the intrasellar region, 12 in both the intra- and suprasellar regions and one in the suprasellar region. The maximum diameter of the RCCs varied from 0.7 to 4 cm, with an average size of 1.7 ± 0.7 cm. MRI features of RCC were divided into three groups based on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI): hypo- (n = 6), iso- (n = 9), and hyperintensity group (n = 7). Patients in the latter two groups were statistically younger than that in the former group. The lesion size in the iso- and hyperintensity groups was significantly less than that in the hypointensity group (F = 6.421, p = 0.007). Only two cases showed enhancement after contrast injection in the cohort. One lesion with haemorrhage was found as were two cases with intracystic nodules. Conclusion: Although MRI features of RCCs are variable, RCCs should be suspected when the following conditions occur: lesions located in the intrasellar region or involving both intra and suprasellar regions, less than 1.5 cm in diameter, iso- or hyperdense on T1WI and no signal enhancement after contrast injection. In addition, the first case of a RCC with a markedly enhanced intracystic nodule is reported. © 2009 The Royal College of Radiologists.

77951956693	CT volume measurement for prognostic evaluation of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma after TACE	Aim: To analyze the value of computed tomography (CT) volume measurements for evaluation of the survival rate of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: One hundred and sixty-six unresectable HCC patients after TACE were involved in this retrospective study. Hepatic CT scan was performed for all patients before and 4 wk to 2 mo after TACE to define the morphologic features of HCC including its largest diameter, volume, product of the greatest axial dimension, tumor to liver volume ratio (TTLVR), and tumor shrinkage ratio. Clinical variables used in the study included gender, age, pattern of tumor growth, number of lesions, Child-Pugh classification of liver function, repeated TACE times, pre- or post-treatment α-fetoprotein (AFP) level, portal vein cancerous thrombus, tumor metastasis, degree of lipiodol retention within the tumor, and percutaneous ethanol injection. The correlation between survival time and clinical variables of patients or lesions was analyzed by combining morphologic features with the corresponding clinical and general data as input. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze prognostic factors. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival time. Influence of the parameters on prognosis was analyzed by the log-rank test. Results: The overall 6, 12, 24, 36 and 60 mo cumu-lative survival rates were 78.92%, 49.85%, 23.82%, 15.60% and 8.92%, respectively. The median survival time was 12 mo. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that only 4 parameters were the independent prognostic factors including TTLVR (χ2 = 14.328, P < 0.001), portal vein cancerous thrombus (χ2 = 5.643, P = 0.018), repeated TACE times (χ2 = 8.746, P = 0.003), and post-treatment serum AFP level (χ2 = 5.416, P = 0.020). When the TTLVR value was less than 70%, the survival time was inversely correlated with the TTLVR value. Conclusion: CT volume measurement technique can predict the prognosis of unresectable HCC patients after TACE. © 2010 Baishideng.

77952568941	MRI findings of primary CNS lymphoma in 26 immunocompetent patients	Objective: To record the MR imaging features of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and compare these features in monofocal and multifocal disease. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one cases of monofocal disease were compared to five cases of multifocal disease. All patients were examined by nonenhanced and contrast-enhanced MRI. Tumor location, tumor size, signal intensity, enhancement characteristics, age distribution, peritumoral edema, cystic changes, and the presence of calcifications were assessed. The MRI features were compared between the monofocal and multifocal disease cases. Results: The 26 cases, including both the monofocal and multifocal cases, exhibited 37 lesions. Contrast-enhanced images showed variable enhancement patterns: homogeneous enhancement (33 lesions), ring-like enhancement (2), and 'open-ring-like' enhancement (2). The 'notch sign' was noted in four of 33 homogeneously enhancing lesions. One case of hemorrhage and three cases of cystic formation were observed. Intra-tumoral calcification was not found. The frontal lobe, the corpus callosum and the basal ganglia were commonly affected in both the monofocal and multifocal groups. Tumor size differed significantly between the two groups (t = 3.129, p < 0.01) and mildly or moderately enhanced lesions were more frequently found in the monofocal group (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between perifocal edema (p > 0.05) and the signal characteristics (p > 0.05) between the two groups. Conclusion: Our data show that PCNSL has a variable enhancement pattern on MR images. We first reported two lesions with an 'open-ring' enhancement as well as four cases with a 'notch sign'. Monofocal PCNSL cases typically have larger sized tumors with mild or moderate enhancement.

77955422205	Acute Mesenteric Ischemia Induced by Ligation of Porcine Superior Mesenteric Vein. Multidetector CT Evaluations	Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for detecting the early changes and dynamic evolution of acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) induced by the ligation of superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in an experimental porcine model. Materials and Methods: Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to three experimental groups, and one control group with three pigs in each group. After laparotomy, the SMV was separated and ligated in nine pigs and separated without ligation in three controls. MDCT pre- and postcontrast with arterial, venous, and delayed phase scans, and CT angiography reconstructions of mesenteric vessels were carried out at preoperation, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 18 hours after ligation. The findings of mesenteric vessels, bowel, abdominal cavity at pre- and postoperation, and dynamic evolution were correlated with pathology. Results: AMI-induced pathological changes were identified in all nine experimental pigs. MDCT angiography clearly delineated main trunk of the SMV, peripheral major and minor tributaries up to brushy vasa recta, and the location and shape of ligations. The early ischemic findings were bowel wall thickening, mesenteric edema, ascites, and pronounced bowel enhancement. Superior mesenteric artery and its major branches appeared spasm with poor filling and delayed and prolonged visualization. SMV and its tributaries were poorly delineated with delayed opacification. We also saw thinning of bowel wall, dilatating bowel with fluid, aggravating mesenteric edema and ascites, and poor enhanced bowel over time. Conclusion: MDCT detects early changes of mesenteric ischemia and its evolution after ligation of porcine SMV, and may find application in early diagnosis of human venous occlusive AMI. © 2010 AUR.

77956121363	Quantitative evaluation of benign meningioma and hemangiopericytoma with peritumoral brain edema by 64-slice CT perfusion imaging	Background: Hemangiopericytomas (HPCs) have a relentless tendency for local recurrence and metastases, differentiating between benign meningiomas and HPCs before surgery is important for both treatment planning and the prognosis appraisal. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlations between CT perfusion parameters and microvessel density (MVD) in extra-axial tumors and the possible role of CT perfusion imaging in preoperatively differentiating benign meningiomas and HPCs. Methods: Seventeen patients with benign meningiomas and peritumoral edema, 12 patients with HPCs and peritumoral edema underwent 64-slice CT perfusion imaging pre-operation. Perfusion was calculated using the Patlak method. The quantitative parameters, include cerebral blood volume (CBV), permeability surface (PS) of parenchyma, peritumoral edema among benign meningiomas and HPCs were compared respectively. CBV and PS in parenchyma, peritumoral edema of benign meningiomas and HPCs were also compared to that of the contrallateral normal white matter respectively. The correlations between CBV, PS of tumoral parenchyma and MVD were examined. Results: The value of CBV and PS in parenchyma of HPCs were significantly higher than that of benign meningiomas (P<0.05), while the values of CBV and PS in peritumoral edema of benign meningiomas and HPCs were not significantly different (P >0.05). MVD in parenchyma of HPCs were significantly higher than that of benign meningiomas (P<0.05). There were positive correlations between CBV and MVD (r=0.648, P<0.05), PS and MVD (r=0.541, P<0.05) respectively. Furthermore, the value of CBV and PS in parenchyma of benign meningiomas and HPCs were significantly higher than that of contrallateral normal white matter (P<0.05), the value of CBV in peritumoral edema of benign meningiomas and HPCs were significantly lower than that of contrallateral normal white matter (P<0.05), while the value of PS in peritumoral edema of benign meningiomas and HPCs were not significantly different with that of contrallateral normal white matter (P >0.05). Conclusions: CT perfusion imaging can provide critical information on the vascularity of HPC and benign meningiomas. Determination of maximal CBV and corresponding PS values in the parenchyma may be useful in the preoperative differentiating HPC from benign meningiomas.

78649703270	Detection of Aβ plaques by a novel specific MRI probe precursor CR-BSA-(Gd-DTPA)n in APP/PS1 transgenic mice	Amyloid plaques are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The lack of specific probes that can detect individual senile plaques in AD has prompted the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) probes. In this study, based on DTPA-gadolinium (III) and congo red (CR), a novel specific MRI probe precursor CR-BSA-(Gd-DTPA)n was successfully synthesized. Its ability to bind to amyloid plaques was evaluated by brain sections from APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Its specificity for Aβ plaques was further demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with the monoclonal antibody to the Aβ protein. Meanwhile, the amyloid deposits detected by the CR-BSA-(Gd-DTPA)n were matched to the amyloid deposits detected by Aβ specific antibody. We also found that a few amyloid-like deposits which was not detected by IHC. The findings indicated that the probe perhaps could detect the neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) similar to the effect of CR itself, and this will be verified in future experiments. The works suggested that the Aβ protein-specific magnetic resonance contrast agent precursor CR-BSA-(Gd-DTPA)n can be used as a potential fluorescence and MR multi-modal imaging probe precursor to display individual senile plaques in AD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78649907556	64-slice CT perfusion imaging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis	Rationale and Objectives: To investigate 64 computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging features of patients with pancreatic cancer and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Materials and Methods: Between January 2003 and April 2010, 234 patients with pancreatic mass underwent 64-CT perfusion imaging. Among them, the histopathological results of 64 patients were proven to be pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 15 patients were proven to be mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, CT perfusion imaging was performed in 33 healthy volunteers served as controls. The slice data were processed using CT perfusion software. Perfusion parameters including time density curve, blood flow, blood volume, permeability, peak enhancement, and time to peak were recorded. Results: Blood flow was 77% lower in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 48% lower in patients with mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 56% lower in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma than with mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P < .016). Blood volume was 65% lower in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 27% lower in mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 53% lower in cancer than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P < .016). Permeability was 559% higher in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 821% higher in mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 28% lower in cancer than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P < .016). Peak enhancement was 27% lower and time to peak 23% longer in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P < .016). Time-density curve showed the peak of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis is earlier and higher than that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the peak of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis is later and lower than that of controls. Conclusion: CT perfusion imaging can provide additional quantitative hemodynamic information of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. © 2011 AUR.

78650174961	Combined diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging: A new way for the assessment of hemispheric transient ischemic attack patients	Abnormalities in diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance images not only occur in stroke patients but also in transient ischemic attack patients. We found magnetic resonance images were abnormal in 28 patients (68%): 15 had diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities, 7 had both diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging defects and 6 had an isolated perfusion-weighted imaging abnormality. Patients with shorter onset to magnetic resonance imaging, large artery atherothrombosis, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia and hemiparesis were more likely to show perfusion-weighted imaging abnormalities. Compared with patients who had a good prognosis, in poor prognosis patients, the relative cerebral blood flow and relative cerebral blood volume was significantly higher. The data suggest that transient ischemic attack patients are more likely to have a poor prognosis when white matter of the symptomatic side shows hyperperfusion within 24. h of symptom onset; however, patients are more likely to have a good prognosis when white matter of the symptomatic side shows hypoperfusion. © 2010 ISDN.

80051958742	Evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging criteria for Meckel's cave lesion: Logistic regression analysis and correlation with surgical findings	Objective: Our aim was to investigate the statistical preoperative diagnostic criteria of lesions of Meckel's cave (MC) on MRI. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the MR images with MC lesions in 34 patients. The MR signs were compared with histopathologic and surgical findings in all lesions. Odds ratio values and the confidence intervals of the MRI diagnostic criteria were evaluated by univariate logistic regression. Results: The following three signs of MC on post-contrast T1WI of MRI have been found to represent the most valuable criterion for determination of MC lesion: (1) contrast enhancement, (2) bulging of lateral wall, and (3) the absence of normal MC, with odds ratios of 362.67 (P<.001), 40.38 (P=001), and 40.38 (P=001) individually. Conclusion: Contrast enhancement on post-contrast T1WI is the most sensitive MR sign for demonstrating the presence of MC lesion. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

84856209678	MRI features in children with desmoplastic medulloblastoma	Desmoplastic medulloblastoma (DMB) is a variant that has a more favorable prognosis compared to classical medulloblastoma, but its MRI features have not been as well described. We retrospectively reviewed the MRI features in children with pathologically proven DMB, including T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and contrast enhanced images, with isotropic diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI also performed in some patients. There were 16 tumors in 12 patients; one patient had five discrete lesions. In all patients, the tumor involved the cerebellar vermis, with nine lesions showing multiple peripheral small cysts. In nine of 16 tumors, there were focal areas of isointensity or hypointensity on T2-weighted or FLAIR images; seven of these showed corresponding focal enhancement. There was also one patient with radiating star-shaped enhancement in two lesions, and a multi-nodular enhancing pattern was observed in another patient. Low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were found in the lesions studied by DW MRI in five patients. DMB may have a typical imaging appearance of peripheral cysts, decreased ADC and focal enhancing areas corresponding to focal isointense or hypointense signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Although these MRI features may distinguish this variant of medulloblastoma, multinodular or star-shaped radiating enhancement may also be detected in some patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Twelve pigs were assigned randomly to three experimental groups and one control group with 3 pigs in each group. After laparotomy, SMV was separated and ligated in 9 pigs, and separated without ligation in 3 control pigs. Pre-and postcontrast MSCT with arterial, venous and delay phase scans, and CT angiography (CTA) reconstructions of mesenteric vessels were carried out at preoperation, 6, 12 and 18 h after ligation. The changes of mesenteric vessels, bowel, abdominal cavity pre-and post-operation, and dynamic evolution were evaluated. The results were compared with those of pathology. Results: AMI changes were identified pathologically in all 9 experimental pigs. MSCT angiography clearly delineated main trunk of SMV, peripheral major and minor tributaries up to brushy vasa recta. It correctly identified the location and shape of ligations. The early ischemic findings appeared as follows: the spasm of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and its major branches which displayed poor filling and delayed and prolonged visualization, poor and delayed opacification of SMV and its tributaries, bowel wall thickness, mesenteric stranding, ascite and pronounced bowel enhancement. With time lapse, thinning bowel wall, dilated bowel with fluid, aggravating edema of mesentery and ascite and poor enhanced bowel were identified. Conclusion: CTA can reliably define normal and occluded mesenteric vessels, detect early changes mesenteric ischemia and evolution, and diagnosis venous occlusive AMI. © 2009 by the Chinese Medical Association.

Methods: Totally 23 patients with AD (AD group), 18 age-and sex-matched normal controls (NC group) underwent SWI. Oblique coronal images perpendicular to the long axis of hippocampus were obtained ranging from bilateral temporal poles to dentate nuclei. The phase values of each ROI in two groups were evaluated and compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Partial Spearman rank correlation coefficient controlled by the age-related bias was used to assess the correlation between phase values in each ROI and MMSE scores in AD group. Results: The phase values of bilateral hippocampus (HP), globus pallidus (GP), caudate nucleus (CAU), substantia nigra (SN), right frontal cortex (FC) and left putmen (PUT) in AD group were significantly lower than those in control group (P<0.05). The phase values of the left PUT were most significantly correlated with the MMSE scores, with the correlation coefficient of 0.53. The correlation coefficient between the phase values of the left HP and the MMSE scores was 0.44. Conclusion: Phase value is proved effective to measure regional iron changes in AD patients. The phase value of left PUT has close correlation with the progression of AD.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) maps and morphological images were preprocessed by SPM5 and voxel-based comparisons between the 2 patient groups and the control group were performed by t test. Results: Relative to the control group, patients with aMCI showed significantly reduced FA value in bilateral frontal, temporal and left occipital WM, left anterior part of cingulum, left inferior parietal lobule, and the WM adjacent to the triangular part of the right lateral ventricle (k ≥ 20 voxels). In mild AD, significantly reduced FA value was found in bilateral hippocampal, inferior parietal lobular, frontal, temporal, and occipital WM, bilateral corpus callosum, anterior part of cingulums, the WM adjacent to the triangular part of the bilateral lateral ventricles, left temporal stem, left thalamus, right precuneus (k ≥ 20 voxels). Significantly reduced GM volume was found in left hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, lingual gyrus and superior temporal gyrus, bilateral insulae and middle temporal gyri in aMCI group when compared with control group (k ≥ 50 voxels). In mild AD, significantly reduced GM volume was found in bilateral hippocampi, parahippocampal gyri, amygdalae, thalami, temporal, parietal, frontal, occipital cortex (k ≥ 50 voxels). The pattern of areas with reduced FA differs from that of the GM volumetric reduction. No areas with significantly reduced FA was detected in aMCI compared with mild AD. There was no significant correlation between FA value of WM in patient groups and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Conclusions: Voxel-based MM DTI analysis of whole brain white matter can objectively reveal widespread white matter abnormalities in early-stage AD. The difference between WM FA reduction pattern and GM volumetric reduction pattern indicates that the pathological WM changes in early-stage AD were caused by multiple mechanisms. FA did not vary significantly in patients progressing from aMCI to mild AD and can hardly reflect the severity of cognitive function damage in these patients. © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84860795708	The value of CT venography in the surgical treatment of falcotentorial junction meningioma	Objective: To explore the value of CT venography in the surgical treatment of falcotentorial junction meningiomas. Methods: CT venography was carried out in 25 patients with falcotentorial junction meningiomas. 2-D and 3-D images were reformatted at the workstation. The classification and relationship between the tumors and veins were determined, and the degree of venous stenosis and collateral were assessed. The safe surgical pathway was chosen to avoid the injury of main draining vein. Results: Falcotentorial junction meningiomas were divided into 5 types according to the relationship between the tumors and veins and the direction of the tumors. There were 5 cases of forward type, 4 cases of backward type, 3 cases of inferior type, 6 cases of superior type and 7 cases of lateral type in this group. The relationship between tumors and veins was accordant with the findings in surgery. Of all 25 cases, 19 underwent total removal, 6 underwent subtotal removal and all of the main driving veins were reserved. There were 3 cases of quadrantanopsia or hemianopsia after the operation, and all of them recovered after 3 months of follow-up. Conclusion: CTV technique can classify the falcotentorial junction meningioma and is helpful for choosing the appropriate surgical approaches. © 2010 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84860500499	MR characteristic changes in ipsilateral substantia nigra following single side middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats	Objective: To analyze the MRI features of the substantia nigra following single side middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by intraluminal thread in rats, and evaluate the ability of MRI in the investigated ability of postischemic secondary damage. Methods: MCAO was induced in male SD rats (270~320 g) for permenent and 90 minutes. The T2WI, DWI signal and ADC, absolute T2 value of the substansia nigra on magnetic resonance imaging were assessed 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d after MCAO using 3.0T MR scanner. Results: The striatal ischemia was showed in all animals following MCAO. In the substantia nigra ipsilateral to infarct, ADC was significantly lower and T2 was significantly higher on the third days, but they did not change significantly on the 1 d, 7 d and 14 d. Conclusion: MRI can demonstrate the secondary damage of the ipsilateral substantia nigra after striatal infarction.

84862204511	Oxygen-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain: A rodent model	Oxygen-enhanced MRI has been shown to be a viable alternative to hyperpolarized gases for pulmonary imaging. The changes in the relaxation times due to hyperoxic conditions in the blood pool induced by inhalation of pure oxygen have produced sufficient signal changes for imaging applications. This is a safe and low-cost alternative for contrast-enhanced imaging. The application of oxygen-enhanced MRI in brain imaging has been much less studied. In this study, we investigated the changes in the relaxation times in the brain due to inhalation of pure oxygen in a rodent model. We also assessed the effects of reduced blood flow due to hyperoxic conditions. Despite the reduced blood flow, significant changes in T1, T2, and T2* relaxation times were detected. We conclude that oxygen-enhanced MRI can be used in rodent models of disease. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84876926574	Reprogramming of adult human neural stem cells into induced pluripotent stem cells	Background Since an effective method for generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human neural stem cells (hNSCs) can offer us a promising tool for studying brain diseases, here we reported direct reprogramming of adult hNSCs into iPSCs by retroviral transduction of four defined factors. Methods NSCs were successfully isolated and cultured from the hippocampus tissue of epilepsy patients. When combined with four factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC), iPSCs colonies were successfully obtained. Results Morphological characterization and specific genetic expression confirmed that these hNSCs-derived iPSCs showed embryonic stem cells-like properties, which include the ability to differentiate into all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion Our method would be useful for generating human iPSCs from NSCs and provide an important tool for studying neurological diseases.

84880036743	In vivo USPIO-enhanced MR signal characteristics of secondary degeneration in the ipsilateral substantia nigra after middle cerebral artery occlusion at 3T	Background and purpose: Ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles to enhance MRI have been used to study neuroinflammation in vivo. Our purpose was to observe the USPIO-enhanced MR signal alterations in the primary ischemic lesion and ipsilateral substantia nigra after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to verify the subsequent sequelae of neuroinflammation seen in the primary ischemic focus and secondary degeneration region. Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient MCAO. In addition to conventional T2-, T1-weighted imaging, USPIO-enhanced MRI was performed in USPIO-injected stroke rats, while Gd-enhanced imaging was acquired in control stroke rats, on days 3, 6 using a 3-T MR scanner. The MR signal characteristics in the primary ischemic striatum, ipsilateral substantia nigra were noted, compared on histopathological H&E, Prussian blue (PB) staining. Results: After MCAO, USPIO-induced T2 hypointensity changes were observed in the primary ischemic region with BBB impairment at both time points. In the substantia nigra ipsilateral to the primary ischemic lesion, there was no evidence of USPIO accumulation detected by MRI and PB staining, and no BBB leakage reflected by Gd-enhanced imaging on days 3 and 6. Conclusion: USPIO-enhanced MR signals have variable characteristics in both primary and remote sites after focal cerebral ischemia. This suggests that the neuroinflammatory response to brain ischemia in the primary ischemic focus and secondary degeneration region have different temporal patterns and pathophysiological mechanisms. © 2013.

84880918262	MRI features of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors in children	Background: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are rare, highly malignant tumors of the central nervous system, usually occurring in young children. Objective: To investigate the MRI features of AT/RT, with special emphasis on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and MR spectroscopy (MRS). Materials and methods: MRI findings of 11 children with AT/RT were reviewed retrospectively, including DWI in 9 AT/RT children and MRS in 6 children. Results: The neoplasms were infratentorial in 4 children and supratentorial in 5 children, both infra- and supratentorial in 1 child and multifocal in 1 child. AT/RT produced heterogeneous signal intensity from peripheral cysts in 7/11 (63%) and hemorrhage in 7/11 (63%). All lesions showed contrast enhancement of varying degrees. Seven (63%) had peritumoral edema. Nine (82%) were hyperintense on DWI with a mean ± SD ADC of 0.60 ± 0.13 × 10

84883782136	Intraoperative ultrasound assistance in resection of intracranial meningiomas	Objective: Intracranial meningiomas, especially those located at anterior and middle skull base, are difficult to be completely resected due to their complicated anatomy structures and adjacent vessels. It's essential to locate the tumor and its vessels precisely during operation to reduce the risk of neurological deficits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate intraoperative ultrasonography in displaying intracranial meningioma and its surrounding arteries, and evaluate its potential to improve surgical precision and minimize surgical trauma. Methods: Between December 2011 and January 2013, 20 patients with anterior and middle skull base meningioma underwent surgery with the assistance of intraoperative ultrasonography in the Neurosurgery Department of Shanghai Huashan Hospital. There were 7 male and 13 female patients, aged from 31 to 66 years old. Their sonographic features were analyzed and the advantages of intraoperative ultrasonography were discussed. Results: The border of the meningioma and its adjacent vessels could be exhibited on intraoperative ultrasonography. The sonographic visualization allowed the neurosurgeon to choose an appropriate approach before the operation. In addition, intraoperative ultrasonography could inform neurosurgeons about the location of the tumor, its relation to the surrounding arteries during the operation, thus these essential arteries could be protected carefully. Conclusions: Intraoperative ultrasonography is a useful intraoperative technique. When appropriately applied to assist surgical procedures for intracranial meningioma, it could offer very important intraoperative information (such as the tumor supplying vessels) that helps to improve surgical resection and therefore might reduce the postoperative morbidity. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

84883812233	Clinicopathological analysis of metaplastic meningioma: Report of 15 cases in Huashan Hospital	Objective: Metaplastic meningioma is a rare subtype of benign meningiomas, classified as WHO grade I with well prognosis. Here we presented our experiences on 15 cases of metaplastic meningioma, to investigate the clinicopathological features, therapies and prognosis of these cases. Methods: 15 patients underwent surgical treatment for intracranial metaplastic meningioma between 2001 and 2010 at Neurosurgery Department of Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. The clinical data, radiological manifestation, treatment strategy, pathological findings and prognosis of all patients were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Among the 15 cases (10 males and 5 females), the age ranged from 22 to 74 years old (the mean age was 50.67-year old). The clinical manifestations include headache, dizziness, seizure attack, vision decrease, and weakness of bilateral lower limbs. All the patients received surgical treatment, combined with radiotherapy in some cases. In the follow-up period, recurrence occurred in 2 cases, of which 1 patient died of other system complications. Conclusions: Metaplastic meningiomas are characterized by focal or widespread mesenchymal differentiation with formation of bone, cartilage, fat, and xanthomatous tissue elements. Surgical removal is the optimal therapy, and the overall prognosis is well. But recurrence may occur in some cases, thus radiotherapy is necessary for such kind of patients. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research. All rights reserved.

84885013346	Tracking induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neural stem cells in the central nervous system of rats and monkeys	Despite of the immense breakthroughs of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), clinical application of iPSCs and their derivates remains hampered by a lack of definitive in vivo studies. Here, we attempted to track iPSCs-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) in the rodent and primate central nervous system (CNS) and explore their therapeutic viability for stem cell replacement in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rats and monkeys with spinal cord injury (SCI). Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles were used to label iPSCs-derived NSCs in vitro. Labeled NSCs were implanted into TBI rats and SCI monkeys 1 week after injury, and then imaged using gradient reflection echo (GRE) sequence by 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. MRI analysis was performed at 1, 7, 14, 21, and 30 days, respectively, following cell transplantation. Pronounced hypointense signals were initially detected at the cell injection sites in rats and monkeys and were later found to extend progressively to the lesion regions, demonstrating that iPSCs-derived NSCs could migrate to the lesion area from the primary sites. The therapeutic efficacy of iPSCs-derived NSCs was examined concomitantly through functional recovery tests of the animals. In this study, we tracked iPSCs-derived NSCs migration in the CNS of TBI rats and SCI monkeys in vivo for the first time. Functional recovery tests showed obvious motor function improvement in transplanted animals. These data provide the necessary foundation for future clinical application of iPSCs for CNS injury. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84893145564	Discriminative analysis of early-stage Alzheimer's disease and normal aging with automatic segmentation technique in subcortical gray matter structures: A multicenter in vivo MRI volumetric and DTI study	Background: Previous studies have revealed that amyloid depositions exist in not only the hippocampus but in other subcortical gray matter structures as well. Diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) parameters might be more sensitive measures of early degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) than conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Purpose: To evaluate the significance of the volumes and the mean diffusivity (MD) values of subcortical gray matter structures in discrimination between early-stage AD and normal subjects using the Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool in FMRIB's Software Library. Material and Methods: Fifty-three cases of early-stage AD and 30 normal aging volunteers from two hospitals were scanned with 3D-FSPGRIR and SSSE-EPI sequences using two similar 1.5T MR systems. The mean relative volumes and mean MD values of subcortical gray matter structures were compared between early-stage AD and control groups. Binary logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to assess the diagnostic significance of every structure's relative volume, MD value, and combination of both. Results: The relative volumes of the left hippocampus, right amygdala, bilateral thalamus, right caudate, left putamen, and bilateral pallidum were significantly lower in the early-stage AD group than in the control group (P<0.05). The MD values of the bilateral hippocampus and pallidum, and of the right thalamus and caudate were significantly elevated in the early-stage AD group (P<0.05). In binary logistic regression analysis, the relative volume of left hippocampus and age entered the final model of volumetric analysis. The MD values of bilateral hippocampi and pallidums entered the final model of MD analysis. The MD values of bilateral hippocampi and pallidums, and the relative volume of left pallidum, entered the final model of combination analysis. The accuracy of three models was 84.7%, 88.9%, and 93.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Pathological changes takes place in the hippocampus and other subcortical gray matter structures in earlystage AD. Diffusive imaging has great diagnostic significance in early-stage AD. The combination of both imaging modalities can lead to better discrimination between early-stage AD and normal aging. © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2013.

84903768671	Systemic injection of TLR1/2 agonist improves adoptive antigen-specific T cell therapy in glioma-bearing mice	Adoptive immunotherapy is an attractive strategy for glioma treatment. However, some obstacles still need be overcome. In this study, GL261-bearing mice treated with adoptively transferred antigen-specific T cells and systemic injection of bacterial lipoprotein (BLP), a TLR1/2 agonist, got a long-term survival and even immune protection. By analyzing adoptive T cells, it was found that BLP maintained T cell survival, proliferation and anti-tumor efficacy in the brains of tumor-bearing hosts. Moreover, tumor microenvironment was modified by up-regulating IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells and down-regulating MDSC, which might be related with high CXCL10 and low CCL2 expression. In addition, TLR2 deficiency abrogated therapeutic effect with increased MDSC accumulation and decreased IFN-γ-secreting CD8+ T cells in the brains. Thus, the systemic injection of BLP could improve the adoptive T cell therapy by maintaining T cell persistence, modifying the tumor microenvironment and even inducing systemic anti-tumor immunity, which might offer a clinically promising immunotherapeutic strategy for glioma. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84905563013	Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation of cartilage repair after microfracture (MF) treatment for adult unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) in the ankle: Correlations with clinical outcome	Objectives: To quantitatively evaluate cartilage repair after microfracture (MF) for ankle osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) using MRI and analyse correlations between MRI and clinical outcome. Methods: Forty-eight patients were recruited and underwent MR imaging, including 3D-DESS, T2-mapping and T2-STIR sequences, and completed American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scoring. Thickness index, T2 index of repair tissue (RT) and volume of subchondral bone marrow oedema (BME) were calculated. Subjects were divided into two groups: group A (3-12 months post-op), and group B (12-24 months post-op). Student's t test was used to compare the MRI and AOFAS score between two groups and Pearson's correlation coefficient to analyse correlations between them. Results: Thickness index and AOFAS score of group B were higher than group A (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). T2 index and BME of group B were lower than group A (P < 0.001, P = 0.012). Thickness index, T2 index and BME were all correlated with AOFAS score (r = 0.416, r = -0.475, r = -0.353), but BME was correlated with neither thickness index nor T2 index. Conclusions: Significant improvement from MF can be expected on the basis of the outcomes of quantitative MRI and AOFAS score. MRI was correlated with AOFAS score. BME is insufficient as an independent predictor to evaluate repair quality, but reduction of BME can improve the patient's clinical outcome. • Patients with unstable ankle OCD had satisfactory clinical outcome after MF. • Quantitative MRI correlates with clinical outcome after MF for ankle OCD. • The reduction of subchondral BME will improve the patient's clinical outcome. • Quantitative MRI can monitor the process of cartilage repair over time. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.

84907875419	Comparison of USPIO-enhanced MRI and Gd-DTPA enhancement during the subacute stage of focal cerebral ischemia in rats	Background: Being one class of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, ultrasmall superparamagnetic particles of iron oxides (USPIO) bear the potential to study neuroinflammation following stroke, but there is still debate over whether the iron oxides particles may enter the brain tissue passively over a damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB). Purpose: To compare the enhancement patterns of USPIO and gadopentate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) during the subacute stage of focal cerebral ischemia, to examine the relationship between USPIO enhancement and BBB disturbance, as well as with neuroinflammatory cell response. Material and Methods: Multiple MR sequences were obtained on days 3 and 6 after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion induced in rats with and without the application of USPIO and Gd-DTPA. The enhancement patterns of the two contrast agents were compared and correlated to histology, including IgG for BBB permeability, Prussian Blue staining for iron particle detection, and CD68 immunohistochemistry staining to identify macrophage/microglia. Results: Gd-DTPA enhancement depicted BBB breakdown being in line with IgG leakage. The USPIO enhanced images demonstrated both diffuse and focal signal alteration in ischemic lesions. The diffuse enhanced pattern had a similar spatial and temporal profile as with Gd-DTPA enhancement. In addition, focal enhanced signal loss was visible on T1-, T2-, and T2∗-weighted images, with a peak tendency of MR signal loss, macrophage/microglia concentration and iron particle accumulation at a later phase of the study. Conclusion: After focal cerebral ischemia, Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI showed a higher sensitivity in detecting BBB alterations than did USPIO enhancement. USPIO provided complementary information regarding inflammatory cell activity in neuroinflammatory to cerebral ischemia that had not been visualized using conventional Gd-DTPA. The assessment using multiple MR parameters may identify intracellular and extracellular USPIO in vivo.

11344249456	Evaluation of spinal cord vessels using multi-slice CT angiography	In summmary, the results obtained from this study indicate that spinal CT angiography can provide valuable information in screening for spinal vascular malformations. Spinal CT angiography could play an important role in two respects: 1 multi-slice spinal CT angiography could screen patients with suspected spinal vascular malformations. However it is difficult to distinguish between anterior median vein and anterior spinal arteries on normal subjects, and abnormal spinal cord vessels are primarily veins located on or close the cord surface; 2 CTA also could be used as a follow-up modality to reflect the success of surgery and/or embolization. It could not be used to classify spinal vascular malformation. In addition, because of its lower temporal resolution compared to DSA, the spinal CT angiography could not replace of DSA due to temperal and spatial resolution.
