21444446516	Overshoot phenomena in PIN diode under EMP with fast rise time	To study the interference effect of the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) on the PIN diode, the one-dimensional numerical modeling is carried out, which solves the semiconductor equations based on the drift-diffusion model. By observing the variation of the distribution of current density and charge density in the PIN diode during the pulse, the occurrence of an overshoot current under a positive or negative voltage is analyzed. The results show that the overshoot current is due to the capacitive performance of PIN diode under high frequency. Whether the pulse voltage is positive or negative, the magnitude of the overshoot current is increasing with less rise time or higher initial positive bias voltage.

0001619564	Optimal 2D-RAKE receiver for coherent DS-CDMA in multipath	The optimal two-dimension RAKE (2D-RAKE) receiver that permits maximum signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is investigated for the cell site of direct sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) communications with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) signaling over the correlated Rayleigh multipath fading. The closed-form bit error rate (BER) is derived under the perfect channel estimation and the maximal average SINR is shown to be the overall 2D-diversity order. BER evaluations indicate that, even in correlated fading among antennas, the optimal 2D-RAKE receiver could achieve the maximal 2D-diversity gain from the completely independent multipath components, and a significant capacity advantage over the conventional RAKE or multi-antenna receiver. This performance gain is found to be sensitive to the selection of 2D-weighting vectors and especially the 2D-diversity order. © 1999 IEEE.

The coupling length and the coupling area of a centre-fed dipole are obtained and analyzed under the conditions that it is illuminated by waves with different arrival angle and connected to a receiver with different operating bandwidth. The results show that, for the dipole operating at 2 GHz, the coupling length has a set of resonance points at the frequency f=2+4n (GHz) (n=0,1,2...) or f=4n (GHz) (n=1,2...) responding to the various bandwidth of a receiver; the coupling area increases with the increasing of the arrival angle of a wave and decreases with the decreasing of the bandwidth of a receiver.

33644653613	Transient response of bipolar junction transistor under intense electromagnetic pulse	By using the finite-difference time-domain method in two-dimension, the transient response of BJT (bipolar junction transistor) under the high power electromagnetic pulse was simulated. The distribution and variation of the electronic field, current density, and the temperature in the transistor during the burnout of the device were obtained and analyzed. The formations of hot spots during the process under the pulse with low and high magnitude were observed. That how the time and energy needed for burnout depended on the magnitude of the pulse was also obtained. When the magnitude of the pulse is relatively low, the hot spot locates near the collector in the breakdown tunnel. When the magnitude of the pulse is sufficiently high, the voltage between the base and the emitter will become very large because of the breakdown between the emitter and collector. Thus a new hot spot occurs due to the breakdown between the base and the emitter, and it will reach the burnout temperature when the magnitude is more than 100 V. With the increase of the magnitude, the time needed for burnout is decreasing exponentially, while the energy needed for burnout is increasing linearly with magnitude from 55 V to 100 V but decreasing with magnitude higher than about 100 V.

33645862601	Altered phase velocity lines for low crosstalk microstrip interconnection of high-speed digital circuits: Design and experimental validation	Altered phase velocity lines are a novel kind of parallel microstrip lines for high-speed interconnection of digital circuits, on which the crosstalk is reduced by the different phase velocities of propagation on the adjacent lines. In this paper, a design method is proposed to optimize the geometry sizes of the altered phase velocity lines. The measured results of a prototype altered phase velocity pair designed by the proposed method are presented to validate the design method. And the effects of the process variation are simulated to analyze the robustness of the prototype in fabrication. The altered phase velocity lines outperform the symmetric parallel microstrip lines in terms of the lower far-end crosstalk (FrdCtk) and the lower dielectric loss. This technique reduces the FrdCtk in the pair of the microstrip transmission lines and does not significantly improve the near-end crosstalk. The prototype works at the speed of 2 Gbps for low crosstalk digital signal transmission, while it can transmit the high-speed clock signal at 10.5 GHz, so the altered phase velocity lines are a useful supplementary to the existing low crosstalk interconnection concepts in the scenario that the parallel microstrips have to be placed closely on printed circuit board. © 2006 IEEE.

The possibility of burnout was analyzed according to the temperature concentration. The simulation results show that the emitter injection is easier to burnout the BJT than the collector injection, and the base injection is relatively difficult. The energy needed for burnout decreases with the magnitude of the pulse in the case of emitter injection, while it becomes independent of the magnitude that is higher than about 30 V. The energy needed for burnout increases with the magnitude of the pulse in the case of collector injection, while it starts to decrease with the magnitude higher than about 100 V.

Both of the estimates and the compensation are carried out in the time domain which allows for a flexible tradeoff between computational complexity, estimation time and compensation performance. Because the estimation of the I/Q imbalance does not need any pilots or training sequence, this technique is applicable to a wide range of single-carrier and/or multi-carrier communication and broadcasting systems. Simulations of a 64QAM-OFDM system show that this technique can achieve the optimal bit error rate (BER) performance under AWGN channel, and can reduce the performance degradation to about 0.1 dB when the BER is 10

34748820007	A novel approach to enhance the bandwidth of mushroom-like EBG structures	Mushroom-like electromagnetic band gap (EBG) structures exhibit unique properties that have led to a wide range of applications. But the EBG structures'forbidden band gaps are narrow for their inherent nature, which restrict them to be used widely. In this paper, a novel approach to enhance the bandwidth of the band gap of mushroom-like EBG structures is proposed. The author will discuss the ways to broaden the bandwidth of the band gap from several aspects, for example by adjusting the parameters in proper way, such as the gaps between adjacent patches, the radii of the related vias. The corresponding gaps concern two orthogonal directions - the X-direction and Y-direction, respectively. A notion of windowing method is used to achieve groups of variable radii of vias, and this new type of mushroom-like EBG structure is approved to have a obviously w id er bandwidth comparing to those of conventional (or uniform) one. And also the optimal gaps between the adjacent patehes in two orthogonal directions that lead to the widest bandwidth are acquired. At the end of this paper, a novel design of mushroom- like EBG structure, which are integrated with both of these two efficient methods, will be obtained and simulated, which exhibit distinctly wider bandwidth than the conventional one.

According to the simulation results for an in-home channel, the following conclusions are obtained To a single receiving point, the shape of the receiving signal depends on its position. To a certain receiving point, the receiving signal is stronger when the transmitting antenna is placed at the height of 1.5m (the normal physiological height) rather than 2.9m (almost up to the roof of the room). The receiving signals are stronger when the transmitting and receiving antennas are polarized in the same direction.

36348993869	Loop delay correction for adaptive digital linearization of power amplifiers	As one of the most common linearization techniques, adaptive digital predistortion minimizes the difference between the input signal of the predistorter and the feedback signal from the power amplifier. The loop delay between these two signals must be controlled precisely so that the convergence of the predistorter should be assured. In this paper a novel two-stage loop delay correction scheme is presented. In the first stage, the integer delay between the input signal and the feedback signal is estimated based on the cross-correlation of them. In the second stage, the fractional delay between these two signals are corrected by a delay lock loop (DLL) circuit, in which a novel timing error detector used as the discriminator is proposed. The proposed loop delay correction scheme is applied to an adaptive digital predistorter in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Simulation results show that the proposed loop delay correction method eliminates the loop delay perfectly, so that nearly optimal power spectral density (PSD) performance is achieved and a high degree of linearization is realized. © 2007 IEEE.

It is shown that the TDS-OFDM still fulfils the circular convolution relationship even if pseudo-noise (PN) sequence is used as guard interval. While conventional methods perform the channel estimation based on the cyclic prefix reconstrction or residual intersymbol interference cancellation in the time domain, by processing the data part and the known symbol padding in one TDS-OFDM block separately, the new proposal uses the one-tap frequency-domain equalization to separate the data part and the known symbol padding and the CIR can be estimated in an iterative manner. In a typical example for 3780-point FFT based TDS-OFDM system with 16QAM constellations, the mean square error (MSE) of of the proposed channel estimator can be reduced to about 10

39749186529	Phase noise suppression in OFDM systems in presence of IQ imbalance	The implementation of OFDM system suffers from the effect of phase noise and IQ imbalance, which disturb the orthogonality between subcarriers and cause intercarrier interference (ICI). When treated separately, effective algorithms, such as the ICI self-cancellation scheme, exist for suppression of phase noise as well as IQ imbalance. However, with both effects present, such algorithms do not lead to effective suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to jointly combat the IQ imbalance and phase noise at baseband. An IQ imbalance estimation and compensation module, which is robust against phase noise, is added in the ICI self-cancellation based OFDM system. After the IQ imbalance has been compensated in the time domain, the ICI self-cancellation scheme of data-conjugate method is used to suppress the phase noise and the residual IQ imbalance. This scheme has a fast convergence and a nearly optimal BER performance even for large IQ imbalance in AWGN channel. In multipath channel, even for large IQ imbalance, this joint suppression scheme offers frequency diversity gain and as a result, the BER performance surpasses that of the conventional OFDM system without IQ imbalance and phase noise. © 2006 IEEE.

Well designed synchronization algorithms are a prerequisite for achieving high-quality multimedia transmission. In this paper, a novel frame synchronization technique, which is robust to carrier frequency offset (CFO), is proposed for DTMB systems. This technique is derived through segmenting the local PN sequence into M contiguous blocks and performing multiple cross-correlations with the received signal. The metric for peak detection is defined as the non-coherent summation of the M cross-correlation magnitude outputs. Moreover, a low-complexity frame synchronizer based on segment-based full correlation for PN420 mode in DTMB system is proposed. It is shown through computer simulation that the proposed techniques generally outperform the conventional ones when CFO occurs, over both AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels. For a DTMB system using PN420 mode, the maximal allowed CFO to keep system still working normally of our proposed schemes are more than 3 times larger than that of the conventional method. © 2007 IEEE.

69249127156	Four-element antenna with selection circuits for adaptive MIMO systems	Antenna selection is an effective method to achieve reconfigurable antenna array for adaptive multi-input multi-output MIMO systems. In this paper, a four-element antenna with selection circuits for adaptive MIMO systems is proposed. By eight pin-diodes embedded in the feeding network, the antenna can select any sub-set of elements while the un-selected ones are terminated to matched lumped resistors. The measured scattering parameters show that whenever any sub-set of elements is selected, the antenna can cover the UMTS band with acceptable isolation. Furthermore, the radiation patterns of the selected elements change little whether other elements are selected or not. Accordingly, owing to keeping patterns steady, the proposed antenna can achieve antenna selection scheme to adapt the varying channel conditions. © 2009 by Editorial Department of Chinese Journal of Radio Science.

0035401482	Reducing the calculational time in determining earth station interference caused by mobile satellite emissions	Analysis of the interference of fixed earth stations caused by mobile satellites requires excess computer time. This paper presents two methods, setting an elevation angle threshold and enlarging the calculational steps to reduce the calculational time. The effects on precession and total running time are discussed using a typical example. The results show that the calculational step can be much longer (200 s-300 s) than the originally expected, which significantly reduces the total running time. The simulation results also show that a proper angle threshold (15° or so )can reduce the running time to 90% of the originally expected running time with satisfactory precession.

77953088640	Speeding up the simulation of the semiconductor device under microwave interference	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of high-power microwave interferences on electronic devices needs the simulation of semiconductor components. Although the semiconductor equations can be solved numerically by Newton method, the conventional Newton method exhibits significant speed degradation when the power of interference is high enough to cause device burnout. Therefore, this paper aims at speeding up the simulation of the semiconductor components under high-power microwave interferences. Design/methodology/approach - Some approximations in conventional Newton method works efficiently onlywhen the electricfield in the simulated semiconductor is relatively low.This is the reason of the formerly mentioned speed degradation problem. The proposed method speeds up the simulation by modifying these approximations to acquire enough precision in these high-power situations. Findings - The modified Newton method proposed in this paper shows an acceleration of 100-150 percent compared to conventional method for typical applications. Moreover, the simulation speed becomes nearly independent of the power of the microwave interferences, which means the speed degradation phenomenon of the conventional method has almost been eliminated. Originality/value - This paper proposes a modified Newton method to speed up the simulation of the semiconductor components under high-power microwave interferences. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

77954869879	Effect of pulse width on thermal effect of microwave pulse on PIN limiter	The PIN diode under high power microwave is simulated by solving the semiconductor equations numerically. The influence of pulse width on the diode's bwronout is studied. The results show that the pulse power for burnout is nearly inversely proportional to the pulse width, if the pulse width is between several nanoseconds and microseconds. This phenomenon is also analyzed on the basis of Leenov's model and Thevinen's theorem. If the pulse width is changed from nanoseconds to microseconds, the thermal effect of the device changes from thermal insulation to thermal conduction and the absorbed power changes from proportional to the incident power to proportion to its square root, both of which lead to the influence of the pulse width.

77955299404	Performance evaluation of a four-element antenna array with selection circuits for adaptive MIMO systems	Reconfigurable antenna arrays increase the flexibility of adaptive MIMO systems. At present, most designs have adopted antenna arrays with reconfigurable elements. However, antenna selection is also an effective method, which has not been fully investigated. In this paper, the potential benefits of a four-element antenna array with selection circuits in the UMTS band (1920-2170 MHz) are explored. The array has eight pin-diodes embedded in the feeding network to select any sub-set of elements. For evaluation, an adaptive MIMO system was set up and a measurement campaign was taken in an indoor multi-path environment. The measurements were performed over a 300 MHz bandwidth centered at 2.05 GHz, covering the UMTS band. The results show that different channel conditions prefer different antenna array configurations. Therefore, in varying channel conditions the antenna array can support antenna selection algorithms to select the best sub-set of elements to increase channel capacity. © 2010 Tsinghua University Press.

The Monte Carlo method was used to study the probability that the output SNR exceeds the given threshold for diversity schemes such as maximum ratio combining and selection combining. In maximal ratio combining, when each branch's average SNR is relatively small compared to the threshold (-4 dB or so for two branches and -13 dB or so for 3 branches), our results show that the probability that the output SNR exceeds the given threshold grows as the correlation coefficient increases. For other conditions, the probability increases is the correlation coefficient decreases.

0036577743	Influence of a metallic enclosure on the S-parameters of microstrip photonic bandgap structures	Planar microstrip photonic bandgap (PBG) structures are periodic arrays of holes etched in the ground plane of a conventional microstrip line. Most of the published studies considered the PBG as an unshielded structure. However, to fabricate a circuit with a PBG structure, a metallic enclosure is often needed. Thus, the S-parameters of the PBG structure will be altered correspondingly. In this paper, the influence of the metallic enclosure on a shielded PBG structure as well as the finite ground plane on an unshielded PBG structure on the S-parameters are analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Conditions for which the influence can be neglected are obtained. The results are useful for the applications of PBG structures.

Using the idea of the high-impedance surface to construct the ground plane, a new type of compact PIFA with a photonic bandgap type (PBG-type) ground plane is proposed.

It is found that the two antennas have similar directivity pattern characteristics, but the size of the latter can be reduced obviously. The results also show that the bandwidth of a traditional PIFA is not greatly affected by the thickness of the metallic ground plane and that the shapes of the directivity patterns are not greatly affected by the ground plane under the small size condition. The operating-frequency band of the proposed antenna can be adjusted by changing the dielectric substrate thickness of the ground plane. They are suitable for mobile communication applications.

12144263716	Analysis on shielding effectiveness of aperture arrays with different shapes	It is important to study the shielding effectiveness to reduce the electromagnetic interference and to protect electronic components. In this paper the shielding effectiveness of aperture arrays on different shapes is calculated and analyzed. The effects of the spaces between the adjacent apertures are analyzed. The results show that the penetration coefficient (PC) of a circle aperture array is the smallest, the one of a square aperture array is medium, and the one of a honey aperture array is the biggest, but their spectrums are almost the same. While for a dumbbell aperture array. because the contour shape is very different with the former aperture arrays, its magnetic current distribution is very different with the other's. Thus the PC of a dumbbell aperture array is bigger than the ones of the former three others, and the PC's spectrum at high frequency is also changed a lot. In addition, when the space between the apertures adds, the mutual coupling between the apertures becomes week, and the field coupled into the shielding enclosure also becomes small.
