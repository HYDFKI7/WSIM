84929727851	Robust stability and stabilization of uncertain fractional-order descriptor nonlinear system	This paper considers the robust stability for uncertain fractional-order (FO) descriptor nonlinear systems. A key analysis technique is enabled by proposed a fundamental boundedness lemma, for the first time. It is used for rigorous robust stability analysis of FO systems, especially for Mittag-Leffler stability analysis of FO nonlinear systems. More importantly, how to obtain a more accurate bound is analyzed to reduce conservative. An FO proportional-derivative controller is utilized to normalize the descriptor system. Furthermore, a criterion for stability of the normalized FO nonlinear system is provided by utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, two illustrative examples show the effectiveness of the proposed stability notion.

The proposed FO power rate type reaching law, including an FO derivative function, is proven to ensure that the state trajectories achieve to the switching surface in a finite time. Most importantly, the calculation formula of the reaching time under the FO reaching law is provided, for the first time. The comparisons between the FO and IO reaching laws reveal the potential advantages of the FO reaching law. Furthermore, the criterion for stability of the sliding mode dynamics is provided by solving linear matrix inequality (LMI).

Both integer order and fractional order boundary control laws are investigated. When delayed boundary measurements are used for boundary control, the Smith predictor is applied. Through extensive hybrid symbolic and numerical simulation, combined with parameter optimization, for the first time, we confirmed that (1) small time delay in boundary control law can destabilize the controlled system; (2) the Smith predictor can compensate the delay effect; and (3) fractional order boundary control can outplay its integer counterpart in terms of transient performance.

0010181605	Repetitive robot visual servoing via segmented trained neural network controller	The purpose of this paper is to design a neural network controller for a nonlinear system with uncertainties which are invariant or repetitive over repeatedly executed tasks such that the maximum tracking errors can be kept within a predefined region through an iterative learning or training process. The desired trajectory is segmented and for each segment a local neural network is constructed. The training of the local neural networks is done iteratively as the task repeats. Meanwhile, the training is segment-wise progressively from the starting segment to the ending one. The accurate tracking of the whole desired trajectory is thus accomplished in a step-by-step or segment-by-segment manner. As an application example, a robot visual servoing control problem is considered with an unknown system structure and camera parameters.

0030312193	Iterative learning control strategy for functional neuromuscular stimulation	An iterative learning controller (ILC) is proposed for the tracking control of functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) system performing the given task repeatedly. A P-type ILC updating law assisted by PD closed-loop controller is suggested for a simpler implementation. This kind of learning from repetitions control strategy supplies strong robustness in tracking control of uncertain time-varying FNS systems, which is essential for the adaptation and customization of FNS applications. Nonlinear muscle recruitment, linear muscle dynamics in force generation, and multiplicative nonlinear torque-angle and torque-velocity scaling factors are considered in the electrically stimulated muscle model for the simulation studies. An one-segment planar system with passive constraints on joint movement is taken as the skeletal model. Simulation results indicate that the control scheme of this paper is promising for FNS system control.

0031282265	Iterative learning identification of aerodynamic drag curve from tracking radar measurements	The aerodynamic drag coefficient curve of spin-stabilized projectiles is very important to the fast generation of accurate firing tables. To identify it from Doppler tracking radar measured velocity data in flight tests, an iterative learning concept (ILC) is applied. High-order ILC algorithms are proposed. Convergence conditions are given in a general problem setting. A 3-DOF point mass trajectory prediction model is proposed. The learning gains, which vary with respect to both time and iteration number, have been used for a faster convergence compared to the constant learning parameter choices. Furthermore, in this paper, a bi-linear ILC scheme is proposed to produce even faster learning convergence. The flight testing data reduction results of an actual firing practice demonstrate that the iterative learning method is very effective in curve identification.

34547113530	Indirect iterative learning control for a discrete visual servo without a camera-robot model	This paper presents a discrete learning controller for vision-guided robot trajectory imitation with no prior knowledge of the camera-robot model. A teacher demonstrates a desired movement in front of a camera, and then, the robot is tasked to replay it by repetitive tracking. The imitation procedure is considered as a discrete tracking control problem in the image plane, with an unknown and time-varying image Jacobian matrix. Instead of updating the control signal directly, as is usually done in iterative learning control (ILC), a series of neural networks are used to approximate the unknown Jacobian matrix around every sample point in the demonstrated trajectory, and the time-varying weights of local neural networks are identified through repetitive tracking, i.e., indirect ILC. This makes repetitive segmented training possible, and a segmented training strategy is presented to retain the training trajectories solely within the effective region for neural network approximation. However, a singularity problem may occur if an unmodified neural-network-based Jacobian estimation is used to calculate the robot end-effector velocity. A new weight modification algorithm is proposed which ensures invertibility of the estimation, thus circumventing the problem. Stability is further discussed, and the relationship between the approximation capability of the neural network and the tracking accuracy is obtained. Simulations and experiments are carried out to illustrate the validity of the proposed controller for trajectory imitation of robot manipulators with unknown time-varying Jacobian matrices. © 2007 IEEE.

0033078346	An iterative learning controller with initial state learning	In iterative learning control (ILC), a common assumption is that the initial states in each repetitive operation should be inside a given ball centered at the desired initial states which may be unknown. This assumption is critical to the stability analysis, and the size of the ball will directly affect the final output trajectory tracking errors. In this paper, this assumption is removed by using an initial state learning scheme together with the traditional D-type ILC updating law. Both linear and nonlinear time-varying uncertain systems are investigated. Uniform bounds for the final tracking errors are obtained and these bounds are only dependent on the system uncertainties and disturbances, yet independent of the initial errors. Furthermore, the desired initial states can be identified through learning iterations.

0033706802	High-order iterative learning controller with initial state learning	A common assumption in iterative learning control (ILC) is that the initial states in each repetitive operation should be inside a given ball centred at the desired initial states. This assumption is critical to the stability analysis, and the size of the ball will directly affect the final output-trajectory tracking errors. However, the initial state may be unobtainable. In this paper, the assumption can be removed by using a high-order initial-state learning scheme together with a high-order D-type ILC updating law. Nonlinear time-dependent uncertain systems are investigated. Uniform bounds of the tracking errors are obtained. These bounds depend only on the bounds of the differences of the uncertainties and disturbances between two successive system repetitions, and not on the re-initialization errors. The unknown desired initial states can be identified through learning iterations. Furthermore, better learning transient behaviour can be expected as the iteration number increases, by using the high-order scheme. This result is illustrated by simulations.

The cogging force is considered as a position-dependent disturbance that is periodic and not necessarily sinusoidal. The key idea of the implemented cogging disturbance compensation method is to use past information for one position period along the state axis to update the current adaptation law. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the adaptive cogging compensation scheme. Furthermore, the advantage of the PALC is demonstrated.

A general fractional-order consensus model is introduced by summarizing three different cases: (i) fractional-order agent dynamics with integer-order consensus algorithms, (ii) fractional-order agent dynamics with fractional-order consensus algorithms, and (iii) integer-order agent dynamics with fractional-order consensus algorithms. We show sufficient conditions on the communication graph and the fractional order such that consensus can be achieved using the general model. The consensus equilibrium is also given explicitly. In addition, we characterize the relationship between the number of agents and the fractional order to ensure consensus. Furthermore, we compare the convergence speed of consensus for fractional-order systems with that for integer-order systems. It is shown that the convergence speed of the fractional-order consensus algorithms can be improved by varying the fractional orders with time.

62949156943	Dual-high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation for state-dependant periodic disturbance	State-periodic disturbances are frequently found in motion control systems. Examples include cogging in permanent magnetic linear motor, eccentricity in rotary machines and etc. This paper considers general form of state-dependent periodic disturbance and proposes a new high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (HO-PALC) method for state-dependent periodic disturbance where the stored information of more than one previous periods is used. The information includes composite tracking error as well as the estimate of the periodic disturbance. This dual HO-PALC (DHO-PALC) scheme offers potential to achieve faster learning convergence. In particular, when the reference signal is also periodically changing, the proposed DHO can achieve much better convergence performance in terms of both convergence speed and final error bound. Asymptotical stability proof of the proposed DHO-PALC is presented. Extensive lab experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed DHO-PALC scheme over the first order periodic adaptive learning compensation (FO-PALC). © 2008 IEEE.

64549137027	Design of dynamic periodic adaptive learning controller for long-term cogging effect compensation	Cogging effect is a serious disadvantage of the permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM), and cogging force is a position-dependent periodic disturbance. In our previous work [1], a dual highorder periodic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-PALC) method for state-dependent periodic disturbance was presented, where the long term stability issue was not addressed. Due to the impact of the high frequency components, when applying the DHO-PALC for a long time, the tracking errors may grow, and the system may become even unstable eventually. This phenomenon also appears in many other practical motion control systems using ILC or RC strategies. In this paper, in order to achieve long term stability, we propose a dual high-order dynamic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-D-PALC) method for cogging effect. In this method, stored information of more than one previous periods are included for both the composite tracking error and the estimate of cogging force. Particularly, since we use a dynamic learning control law to update the current estimate of cogging, the long term stability can be guaranteed. Extensive simulation results are included to demonstrate, 1) high-order in composite tracking error offers faster convergence, 2) high-order in cogging estimate better accommodates the case of varying reference signal, 3) dual high-order scheme has the potential of much better performance over the conventional first-order scheme, and 4) the introduction of dynamic learning updating scheme helps achieving the long term stability of the adaptive learning controller. © 2008 IEEE.

70049104872	Fractional order [proportional derivative] controller for a class of fractional order systems	Recently, fractional order systems (FOS) have attracted more and more attention in various fields. But the control design techniques available for the FOS suffer from the lack of direct systematic approaches. In this paper, we focus on a given type of simple model of FOS. A fractional order [proportional derivative] (FO-[PD]) controller is proposed for this class of FOS, and a practical and systematic tuning procedure has been developed for the proposed FO-[PD] controller synthesis. The fairness issue in comparing with other controllers such as the traditional integer order PID (IO-PID) controller and the fractional order proportional derivative (FO-PD) controller has been addressed under the same number of design parameters and the same specifications. Fair comparisons of the three controllers (i.e., IO-PID, FO-PD and FO-[PD]) via the simulation tests illustrate that, the IO-PID controller designed may not always be stabilizing to achieve flat-phase specification while both FO-PD and FO-[PD] controllers designed are always stabilizing.

70449646554	Fractional order periodic adaptive learning compensation for cogging effect in PMSM position servo system	Fractional calculus is a generalization of the integration and differentiation to the fractional (non-integer) order. In this paper, we devised a fractional-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (FO-PALC) method for cogging effect minimization for permanent magnetic synchronous motors (PMSM) position and velocity servo system. Cogging effect is a major disadvantage of PMSM. In fact, the cogging force in PMSM is a position-dependent periodic disturbance. In our FO-PALC scheme, in the first trajectory period, a fractional order adaptive compensator for cogging effect is designed to guarantee the boundedness of all signals. From the second repetitive trajectory period and onward, one period previously stored information along the state axis is used in the current adaptation law together with a fractional order low pass filter.

77949484635	Hardware-in-the-loop experimental study on a fractional order networked control system testbed	Networked Control Systems (NCS) are of great interest in many industries because of their convenience in data sharing and manipulation remotely. However, there are several problems along with NCS itself due to the uncertainties in network communication. One issue inherent to NCS is the network-induced delays which may deteriorate the performance and may even cause instability of the system. Therefore a controller which can make the plant stable at large values of delay is always desirable in NCS systems. Our past work on Optimal Fractional Order Proportional Integral (OFOPI) controller showed that fractional order PI controllers have larger jitter margin (maximum value of delay for which system is stable) for lag-dominated systems when compared to traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers, whereas integer order PID controllers have larger jitter margin for delay-dominated systems. This paper aims at the design process of a tele-presence controller based on OFOPI tuning rules. To illustrate this, an extensive experimental study on the real-time Smart Wheel networked speed control system is performed using hardware-in-the-loop control. The real-time random delay in the world wide network is collected by pinging different locations, and is considered as the delay in our simulation and experimental systems. Comparisons are made with existing integer order PID controller. It is found that the proposed OFOPI controller is a promising controller and has faster response time than the traditional integer order PID controllers. Since the plant into consideration viz. the Smart Wheel is a delay-dominated system, it is verified that PID achieves larger jitter margin as compared to OFOPI tuning rules. Simulation results and real-time experiments showing comparisons between OFOPI and OPID tuning rules prove the significance of this method in NCS. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

77950826824	Auto-tuning of FOPI and FO[PI] controllers with iso-damping property	A systematical design method for robust integer order proportional- integral-derivative(IOPID) controller with an iso-damping property was suggested in [3]. In this paper, two auto-tuning methods of Fractional Order Proportional Integral(FOPI) and Fractional Order [Proportional Integral] (FO[PI]) controllers with iso-damping property for a class of unknown, stable and minimum phase plants are designed and summarized. The FOPI and FO[PI] controllers designed by the two methods ensure that the phase Bode plot is flat, i.e., the phase derivative w.r.t. the frequency is zero at a given frequency called the "tangential frequency", so that the closed-loop system is robust to gain variations and the unit step responses exhibit iso-damping property. During the process of the FOPI and FO[PI] controllers design and simulation, no plant models are assumed. Several relay feedback tests are used to identify the plant gain and phase at the tangential frequency in an iterative way. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed auto-tuning methods for robust FOPI and FO[PI] controllers with isodamping property. ©2009 IEEE.

Although an autonomous system cannot define a dynamical system in the sense of semigroup because of the memory property determined by the fractional derivative, we can still use the Lyapunov exponents to discuss its dynamical evolution. In this paper, we first define the Lyapunov exponents for fractional differential systems then estimate the bound of the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. For linear fractional differential system, the bounds of its Lyapunov exponents are conveniently derived which can be regarded as an example for the theoretical results established in this paper.

77953689479	Analysis of electrochemical noise (ECN) of Ti02 nanoparticles coated Ti-6AL-4V in simulated biofluids using Fractional Order Signal Processing (FOSP) techniques	The electrochemical noise (ECN) measurements were conducted and used to assess the corrosion behaviors of the bare and Ti02 nanoparticles coated Ti-6Al-4V bioimplants exposed to three simulated biofluid solutions: 1) NaCl solution; 2) Hank's solution; and 3) Cigada solution. The ECN data for bioimplants in these solutions were assessed by signal analysis techniques in both the time and frequency domains. In time domain analysis, the parameters including skewness, kurtosis, and noise resistance (Rn) were calculated. In frequency domain analysis, we introduced Fractional Order Signal Processing (FOSP) techniques to process the ECN data. Our results suggested that FOSP may provide a better signal analysis tool to evaluate the ECN signals than the conventional fast Fourier transforms (FFT) processing method. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

77953692215	A fractional order signal processing (FOSP) technique for chemotaxis quantification using video microscope	Bacterial chemotaxis has recently attracted great interest in purification of groundwater, monitored natural attenuation and contaminant containment. Quantitatively evaluating chemotaxis accurately would lead to a better comprehension of the role of chemotaxis and its broad use in applications.

77953711258	Robustness analysis of the estimators for noisy long-range dependent time series	Processes with long-range correlations or called long-range dependent (LRD) processes are all around us in nature. The presence and nature of LRD is characterized by the Hurst parameter (0 < H < 1). The aim of this paper is to make a practical analysis of the robustness of the Hurst parameter estimators. A simple model of exactly self-similar process-Fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) with parameter H ε (0,1) is applied to evaluate Hurst parameter estimators. The white Gaussian noise or the Symmetric α-stable (SαS) noise is superimposed in order to evaluate the reliability and the robustness of different estimators. In this paper, six statistic analysis methods, R/S statistic, Aggregated Variance method, Absolute Value method, Residuals of Regression method, Periodogram method, and Whittle method are analyzed. It follows from the comparison that the Variance of Residuals method is almost unbiased for non-noise LRD processes. And the Whittle method has best robustness to Symmetric α-stable (SαS) noisy LRD processes. The robustness analysis has practical value for analyzing noisy LRD time series, especially for the economic data, under water signal, biomedical signal and the communication signal which are corrupted by impulsive noise.

77953714274	The modeling of Great Salt Lake elevation time series based on ARFIMA with stable innovations	Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the largest salt lake in the western hemisphere, the fourth-largest terminal lake in the world. The elevation of Great Salt Lake has critical effect on the people who live nearby and their properties. It is crucial to build an exact model of GSL elevation time series in order to predict the GSL elevation precisely. Although some models, such as FARIMA or ARFIMA (Auto-Regressive Fractional Integral and Moving Average), GARCH (Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Het- eroskedasticity) and FIG ARCH (Fractional Integral Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), have been built to characterize the variation of Great Salt Lake elevation, these models can not characterize it perfectly. Therefore, it became a key point to build a more appropriate model of GSL elevation time series. In this paper a new model based on fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARFIMA) with Stable innovations is applied to analyze the data and predict the future levels. From the analysis we can see that the new model can characterize GSL elevation time series more accurately. The new model will be beneficial to predict GSL elevation more precisely.

77953716147	Fractional order proportional derivative (FOPD) and FO[PD] controller design for networked position servo systems	This paper considers the fractional order proportional derivative (FOPD) controller and fractional order [proportional derivative] (FO[PD]) controller for networked position servo systems. The systematic design schemes of the networked position servo system with a time delay are presented. It follows from the Bode plot of the FOPD system and the FO[PD] that the given gain crossover frequency and phase margin are fulfilled. Moreover, the phase derivative w.r.t. the frequency is zero, which means that the closed-loop system is robust to gain variations at the given gain crossover frequency. However, sometimes we can not get the controller parameters to meet our robustness re-quirement. In this paper, we have studied on this situation and presented the requirement of the gain cross frequency, and phase margin in the designing process. For the comparison of fractional order controllers with traditional integer order controller, the integer order proportional integral differential (IOPID) was also designed by using the same proposed method. The simulation results have verified that FOPD and FO[PD] are effective for networked position servo. The simulation results also reveal that both FOPD controller and FO[PD] controller outperform IO-PID controller for this type of system. Copyright © 2009 by ASME.

77957344581	A variable-order fractional operator based synthesis method for multifractional Gaussian noise	Fractional Gaussian noise (fGn) with a constant Hurst parameter H can be used to more accurately characterize the long memory process than traditional short-range dependent stochastic processes, such as Markov, Poisson or ARMA processes. However, the ability of fGn is limited for modeling the stochastic processes with prescribed local forms. Therefore, the multifractional Gaussian noise (mGn) with local HOlder exponent which varies with a variable t (usually time), become more important both in theory and in practical applications. In this paper, by studying the relationship of white Gaussian noise (wGn), mGn and multifractional Brownian motion (mBm), a synthesis method which is based on variable-order fractional operators for synthesizing mGn is provided. Furthermore, the synthesis method of multifractional α-stable processes, the generalization of mGn, is proposed in the paper in order to more accurately characterize the processes with local scaling characteristic and heavy tailed distribution. Some synthetic examples of mGn and multifractional α-stable noises are provided in the paper. © 2010 IEEE.

Additionally, the network induced timevarying delay is considered as being generated by a known FO dynamic system. We show how the delay dynamics can be explicitly incorporated into the Networked Control System controller design. The basic idea is to use linear matrix inequality and receding horizon control framework. We use the receding horizon method to design a stabilizing control law that sets the poles of the closed-loop system.

77957901203	Cogging effect minimization in PMSM position servo system using dual high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation	Cogging effect which can be treated as a type of position-dependent periodic disturbance, is a serious disadvantage of the permanent magnetic synchronous motor (PMSM). In this paper, based on a simulation system model of PMSM position servo control, the cogging force, viscous friction, and applied load in the real PMSM control system are considered and presented. A dual high-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (DHO-PALC) method is proposed to minimize the cogging effect on the PMSM position and velocity servo system. In this DHO-PALC scheme, more than one previous periods stored information of both the composite tracking error and the estimate of the cogging force is used for the control law updating. Asymptotical stability proof with the proposed DHO-PALC scheme is presented. Simulation is implemented on the PMSM servo system model to illustrate the proposed method. When the constant speed reference is applied, the DHO-PALC can achieve a faster learning convergence speed than the first-order periodic adaptive learning compensation (FO-PALC). Moreover, when the designed reference signal changes periodically, the proposed DHO-PALC can obtain not only faster convergence speed, but also much smaller final error bound than the FO-PALC. © 2010 ISA.

Simulation and experimental results in the reference show that, the dynamic performance and robustness with the designed FOPD controller outperforms that with the optimized traditional integer order proportional integral (IOPI) controller at normal speed. Furthermore, it is found that, for the ultra low-speed position tracking with a significant friction effect, the tracking performance using the designed FOPD controller is much better than that using the optimized IOPI controller. However, the reason of this advantage is unclear. In this paper, using the describing function method and Bode plots analysis, the observed advantage of the designed FOPD controller over the optimized IOPI controller, for the nonlinear low-speed position tracking system with friction effect, is explained with the theoretical analysis. This explanation for the priority of the designed FOPD controller is consistently demonstrated by the extended experimental results in this paper. © 2010 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

But for differential equations with non-integer order, the Laplace transform technique works effectively only for relatively simple equations, because of the difficulties of calculating inversion of Laplace transforms.

7944236978	Iterative learning neural network control for robot learning from demonstration	Learning from demonstration is an efficient way for transfering movement skill from a human teacher to a robot. Using a camera as a recorder of the demonstrated movement, a learning strategy is required to acquire knowledge about the nonlinearity and uncertainty of a robot-camera system through repetitive practice. The purpose of this paper is to design a neural network controller for vision-based movement imitation by repetitive tracking and to keep the maximum training deviation from a demonstrated trajectory in a permitted region. A distributed neural network structure along a demonstrated trajectory is proposed. The local networks for a segment of the trajectory are invariant or repetitive over repeated training and are independent of the other segments. As a result, a demonstrated trajectory can be decomposed into short segments and the training of the local neural networks can be done segment-wise progressively from the starting segment to the ending one. The accurate tracking of the whole demonstrated trajectory is thus accomplished in a step-by-step or segment-by-segment manner. It is used for trajectory imitation by demonstration with an unknown robot-camera model and shows that it is effective in ensuring uniform boundedness and efficient training.

79551588124	Heavy-tailed distribution and local long memory in time series of molecular motion on the cell membrane	The joint presence of heavy-tailed distribution and long memory in time series always leads to certain trouble in correctly obtaining the statistical characteristics for time series modeling. These two properties i.e., heavy-tailed distribution and long memory, cannot be neglected in time series analysis, because the tail thickness of the distribution and long memory property of the time series are critical in characterizing the essence of the resulting natural or man-made phenomenon of the time series. Meanwhile, the fluctuation of the varying local long memory parameter may be used to capture the internal changes which underlie the externally observed phenomenon. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed to use the variance trend, heavy-tailed distribution, long memory, and local long memory characteristics to analyze a time series recorded as in [1] from tracking the jumps of individual molecules on cell membranes. The tracked molecules are Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) expressed on rat hepatoma cells. The analysis results show that the jump time series of molecular motion on the cell membrane obviously has both heavy-tailed distribution and local long memory characteristics. The tail heaviness parameters, long memory parameters, and the local long memory parameters of ten MHCI molecular jump time series are all summarized with tables and figures in the paper. These reported tables and figures are not only interesting but also important in terms of additional novel insights and characterization of the time series under investigation. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

In order to meet the requirements of analysing the LRD processes, a number of practical estimation methods have been proposed in the literature. Furthermore, some efforts have been made to evaluate the accuracy and validity of the Hurst estimators for LRD processes. In practice, however, many signals measured are corrupted with various types of noises, and sometimes even the concerned signal itself has infinite variance. In such cases, which estimator has the best robustness to the LRD property of the signal and its noise involved, and how robust it is are still unresolved. The aim of this paper is to make a quantitative analysis of the robustness of twelve commonly used Hurst parameter estimators. In this paper, we considered four types of LRD signals with possible noises. They are 1) LRD process alone; 2) LRD process corrupted by 30 dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) white Gaussian noise; 3) LRD process corrupted by 30 dB SNR stable noise; 4) fractional autoregressive moving average (FARIMA) time series with stable innovations.

80053434538	Remote output feedback stabilization for fractional-order systems via communication networks	In this study, the problem of remote output feedback stabilization for fractional-order (FO) systems with input time-varying delay via communication networks is investigated. The order of the FO system denoted by α considered in this paper is in the range of 0 to 2. Additionally, the network induced time-varying delay is considered as being generated by a known FO dynamic system. We design static output feedback and dynamic output feedback controller, respectively, and show how the delay dynamics can be explicitly incorporated into the Networked Control System controller design. The basic idea is to use linear matrix inequality and receding horizon control framework. We use the receding horizon method to design a stabilizing control law that sets the poles of the closed-loop system. The proposed control law explicitly takes into account an estimation of the delay dynamics. Finally, numerical examples are offered to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2011 IEEE.

82155167283	Fractional order proportional derivative (FOPD) and FO[PD] controller design for networked position servo systems	This paper considers the fractional order proportional derivative (FOPD) controller and fractional order [proportional derivative] (FO[PD]) controller for networked position servo systems. The systematic design schemes of the networked position servo system with a time delay are presented. It follows from the Bode plot of the FOPD system and the FO[PD] that the given gain crossover frequency and phase margin are fulfilled. Moreover, the phase derivative w.r.t. the frequency is zero, which means that the closed-loop system is robust to gain variations at the given gain crossover frequency. However, sometimes we can not get the controller parameters to meet our robustness requirement. In this paper, we have studied on this situation and presented the requirement of the gain cross frequency, and phase margin in the designing process. For the comparison of fractional order controllers with traditional integer order controller, the integer order proportional integral differential (IOPID) was also designed by using the same proposed method. The simulation results have verified that FOPD and FO[PD] are effective for networked position servo. The simulation results also reveal that both FOPD controller and FO[PD] controller outperform IO-PID controller for this type of system. © 2009 by ASME.

82155167361	Analysis of electrochemical noise (ECN) of TIO2 nanoparticles coated TI-6AL-4V in simulated biofluids using fractional order signal processing (FOSP) techniques	The electrochemical noise (ECN) measurements were conducted and used to assess the corrosion behaviors of the bare and TiO2 nanoparticles coated Ti-6Al-4V bioimplants exposed to three simulated biofluid solutions: 1) NaCl solution; 2) Hank's solution; and 3) Cigada solution. The ECN data for bioimplants in these solutions were assessed by signal analysis techniques in both the time and frequency domains. In time domain analysis, the parameters including skewness, kurtosis, and noise resistance (Rn) were calculated. In frequency domain analysis, we introduced Fractional Order Signal Processing (FOSP) techniques to process the ECN data. Our results suggested that FOSP may provide a better signal analysis tool to evaluate the ECN signals than the conventional fast Fourier transforms (FFT) processing method. © 2009 by ASME.

82155167373	Robustness analysis of the estimators for noisy long-range dependent time series	Processes with long-range correlations or called long-range dependent (LRD) processes are all around us in nature. The presence and nature of LRD is characterized by the Hurst parameter (0 < H < 1). The aim of this paper is to make a practical analysis of the robustness of the Hurst parameter estimators. A simple model of exactly self-similar process-Fractional Gaussian noise (FGN) with parameter H ∈ (0,1) is applied to evaluate Hurst parameter estimators. The white Gaussian noise or the Symmetric α-stable (SαS) noise is superimposed in order to evaluate the reliability and the robustness of different estimators. In this paper, six statistic analysis methods, R/S statistic, Aggregated Variance method, Absolute Value method, Residuals of Regression method, Periodogram method, and Whittle method are analyzed. It follows from the comparison that the Variance of Residuals method is almost unbiased for non-noise LRD processes. And the Whittle method has best robustness to Symmetric α-stable (SαS) noisy LRD processes. The robustness analysis has practical value for analyzing noisy LRD time series, especially for the economic data, under water signal, biomedical signal and the communication signal which are corrupted by impulsive noise. © 2009 by ASME.

82155168199	Digital fractional order Savitzky-Golay differentiator	This brief proposes a design method for a digital fractional order Savitzky-Golay differentiator (DFOSGD), which generalizes the Savitzky-Golay filter from the integer order to the fractional order for estimating the fractional order derivative of the contaminated signal. The proposed method calculates the moving window's weights using the polynomial least-squares method and the Riemann-Liouville fractional order derivative definition, and then computes the fractional order derivative of the given signal using the convolution between the weights and the signal, instead of the complex mathematical deduction. Hence, the computation time is greatly improved. Frequency-domain analysis reveals that the proposed differentiator is essentially a fractional order low-pass filter. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DFOSGD can accurately estimate the fractional order derivatives of both noise-free signal and contaminated signal. © 2011 IEEE.

82155173200	The modeling of Great Salt Lake elevation time series based on ARFIMA with stable innovations	Great Salt Lake (GSL) is the largest salt lake in the western hemisphere, the fourth-largest terminal lake in the world. The elevation of Great Salt Lake has critical effect on the people who live nearby and their properties. It is crucial to build an exact model of GSL elevation time series in order to predict the GSL elevation precisely. Although some models, such as FARIMA or ARFIMA (Auto-Regressive Fractional Integral and Moving Average), GARCH (Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Het-eroskedasticity) and FIGARCH (Fractional Integral Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), have been built to characterize the variation of Great Salt Lake elevation, these models can not characterize it perfectly. Therefore, it became a key point to build a more appropriate model of GSL elevation time series. In this paper a new model based on fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARFIMA) with Stable innovations is applied to analyze the data and predict the future levels. From the analysis we can see that the new model can characterize GSL elevation time series more accurately. The new model will be beneficial to predict GSL elevation more precisely. © 2009 by ASME.

In the first trajectory period of the proposed FO-PALC scheme, a fractional order adaptive compensator is designed which can guarantee the boundedness of the system state, input and output signals. From the second repetitive trajectory period and onward, one period previously stored information along the state axis is used in the current adaptation law.

In this paper, a guideline for choosing feasible or achievable gain crossover frequency and phase margin specifications, and a new FOPI/IOPID controller synthesis are proposed for all FOPTD systems. Using this synthesis scheme, the complete feasible region of the gain crossover frequency and phase margin can be obtained and visualized in the plane. With this region as the prior knowledge, all combinations of the phase margin and gain crossover frequency can be verified before the controller design. Only if the combination is chosen from this achievable region, the existence of the stabilizing and desired FOPI/IOPID controller design can be guaranteed. Especially, it is interesting to compare the areas of these two feasible regions for the IOPID controller and the FOPI controller. This area comparison reveals, for the first time, the potential advantages of one controller over the other in terms of achievable performances. As a basic step, a scheme for finding the stabilizing region of the FOPI/IOPID controller is presented first, and then a new scheme for designing a stabilizing FOPI/IOPID controller satisfying the given gain crossover frequency, phase margin and flat phase constraint is proposed in details. Thereafter, the complete information about the feasible region of gain crossover frequency and phase margin is collected. This feasible region for the FOPI controller is compared with that for the traditional IOPID controller. This area comparison shows the advantage of the FOPI over the traditional IOPID clearly. Simulation illustration is presented to show the effectiveness and the performance of the designed FOPI controller comparing with the designed IOPID controller following the same synthesis in this paper. © 2011 IEEE.

84861204912	Finite difference schemes for variable-order time fractional diffusion equation	Variable-order fractional diffusion equation model is a recently developed and promising approach to characterize time-dependent or concentration-dependent anomalous diffusion, or diffusion process in inhomogeneous porous media. To further study the properties of variable-order time fractional subdiffusion equation models, the efficient numerical schemes are urgently needed. This paper investigates numerical schemes for variable-order time fractional diffusion equations in a finite domain. Three finite difference schemes including the explicit scheme, the implicit scheme and the Crank-Nicholson scheme are studied. Stability conditions for these three schemes are provided and proved via the Fourier method, rigorous convergence analysis is also performed. Two numerical examples are offered to verify the theoretical analysis of the above three schemes and illustrate the effectiveness of suggested schemes. The numerical results illustrate that, the implicit scheme and the Crank-Nicholson scheme can achieve high accuracy compared with the explicit scheme, and the Crank-Nicholson scheme claims highest accuracy in most situations. Moreover, some properties of variable-order time fractional diffusion equation model are also shown by numerical simulations. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

Among these techniques, the Hurst exponent estimation was widely used to characterize the fractional or scaling property of the EEG signals. However, the constant Hurst exponent H cannot capture the detailed information of dynamic EEG signals. In this research, the multifractional property of the normal human sleep EEG signals is investigated and characterized using local Hölder exponent H(t). The comparison of the analysis results for human sleep EEG signals in different stages using constant Hurst exponent H and the local Hölder exponent H(t) are summarized with tables and figures in the paper. The results of the analysis show that local Hölder exponent provides a novel and valid tool for dynamic assessment of brain activities in different sleep stages. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84861219080	Introduction	Fractional Dynamics and Control is emerging as a new hot topic of research which draws tremendous attention and great interest. Although the fractional calculus appeared almost in the same era when the classical (or integer-order) calculus was born, it has recently been found that it can better characterize long-memory processes and materials, anomalous diffusion, long-range interactions, long-term behaviors, power laws, allometric scaling laws, and so on. Complex dynamical evolutions of these fractional differential equation models, as well as their controls, are becoming more and more important due to their potential applications in the real world. This special issue includes one review article and twenty-three regular papers, covering fundamental theories of fractional calculus, dynamics and control of fractional differential systems, and numerical calculation of fractional differential equations. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.

84862937075	Convergence speed of a fractional order consensus algorithm over undirected scale-free networks	Scale-free networks have been rediscovered universally in natural and man-made systems, and the consensus protocols have been tremendously studied over the last decade. Motivated by the fractional-order dynamics of bacteria colonies, a fractional-order protocol is employed to achieve the consensus over scale-free networks. The most remarkable property of scale-free networks lies in the inverse power-law degree distributions. The present work concerns the convergence speed with different fractional orders corresponding to different power-law parameters. The analytic solutions of consensus protocols are given and its property is discussed, explaining the quick convergence speed in the early stage of the consensus process, and the slower performance later. Inspired by such behavior, a switching order consensus protocol is proposed, which efficiently increases the convergence speed and ensures the exponential convergence as time tends to infinity. The disagreement of the system during the consensus procedure is investigated. Theoretic analysis and simulations demonstrate that, for certain scale-free networks, an optimal order exists so that the fractional-order consensus algorithm can minimize the disagreement or its integral. © 2011 John Wiley and Sons Asia Pte Ltd and Chinese Automatic Control Society.

The fourth order Runge-Kutta method and tenth order continued fraction expansion Euler (CFE-Euler) method are introduced to simulate the proposed system equation of fractional order cracked rotors. The effects of derivative order of damping, rotating speed ratio, crack depth, orientation angle of imbalance relative to the crack direction and mass eccentricity on the system dynamics are demonstrated by bifurcation diagram, Poincare map and rotor trajectory diagram. The results show that the rotor system gets chaotic, quasi-periodic and periodic as the fractional order increases. It is also found that the imbalance eccentricity level, crack depth, rotational speed, fractional damping and crack angle all exert considerable influence on the nonlinear behaviors of cracked rotor system.

Four types of multifractional processes are synthesised to test the tracking performance and robustness of these 12 sliding-windowed Hurst estimators. They are (i) noise-free multifractional process; (ii) multifractional process corrupted by 30-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) white Gaussian noise; (iii) multifractional process corrupted by 30-dB SNR impulse noise; and (iv) multifractional stable process, which has no finite second-order statistics. Furthermore, the standard error of different sliding-windowed Hurst estimators are calculated in order to quantify the accuracy and robustness. This study provides a guideline and principle in the selection of Hurst estimators for noise-free multifractional process, noise-corrupted multifractional process and multifractional process with infinite second-order statistics. The results of this analysis show that the sliding-windowed Kettani and Gubner's method provides the best-tracking performance for multifractional processes with linear trend local Hölder exponent and good robustness to noise. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84863563731	Fractional order constitutive model of geomaterials under the condition of triaxial test	Fractional calculus has been successfully applied to characterize the rheological property of viscoelastic materials, however, geomaterials were seldom involved in fractional order constitutive models (FOCM), and the issue of first loading and then unloading is rarely discussed through fractional calculus. It is considered that all materials are arranged in a queue and ideal solid and Newtonian fluid are located at both ends of the queue in FOCM. On the basis of FOCM, stress-strain relation under the condition of first loading and then unloading, besides creep, stress-relaxation and loading of constant strain rate are obtained. The stress-strain relation is utilized to fit triaxial test results of geomaterials under the corresponding conditions. The comparison between the test and fitting results reveals that FOCM can reasonably describe the stress-strain, stress-time or strain-time characteristics of geomaterials, which shows that fractional calculus is a good tool to constitutive model research of geomaterials. © 2011 by ASME.

84863567228	Effects of median filtering on fractional processes	Median filtering, an effective non-linear signal enhancement technique, has been successfully used for the suppression of impulsive noise and extracting features from noisy signals. Although median filtering can effectively preserve the sharp changes in signals, some signal distortion may be introduced and some features of signals may be lost. In this research, we investigate the effects of median filtering on fractional processes which are characterized by the heavy-tailed distribution or the long-range dependence (LRD). The effects of median filtering on heavy-tailed distribution characteristic of a-stable processes, and on LRD property of long-range dependent processes are investigated, respectively. Besides, the effects of median filtering on both the heavy tailed distribution and the LRD properties of fractional autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) with stable innovations time series are studied. The analysis results show that the heavy-tailed distribution and the LRD properties of fractional processes are evidently affected by median filtering. © 2011 by ASME.

The network consists of agents with heterogeneous fractional-order non-linear dynamics. It can be divided into several groups due to their dynamics or equilibriums. Each group will be stabilized at an equilibrium and different groups may have different steady state values. A necessary and sufficient condition is provided for the proposed pinning control law to be locally Mittag-Leffler stable. The conclusion turns to guarantee the exponential stable for integer-order systems. The collection of heterogeneous equilibriums is determined by the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue respect to the graph Laplacian.

Based on the fractional It̂o formula, we present the corresponding fBm-driven Fokker-Planck equation for the nonlinear stochastic differential equations driven by an fBm. We then apply it to establish the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of the fBm-driven O-U process. We further obtain the closed form of such PDF by combining the Fourier transform and the method of characteristics. Interestingly, the obtained PDF has an infinite variance which is significantly different from the classical O-U process. We reveal that the fBm-driven O-U process can describe the heavy-tailedness or anomalous diffusion. Moreover, the speed of the sub-diffusion is inversely proportional to the viscosity coefficient, while is proportional to the Hurst parameter. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations to verify the above findings. © 2012 Diogenes Co., Sofia.

The bounds of the uncertainty and external disturbance are assumed to be unknown. Appropriate adaptive laws are designed to tackle the uncertainty and external disturbance. In the adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) strategy, fractional-order derivative is introduced to obtain a novel sliding surface. The adaptive sliding mode controller is shown to guarantee asymptotical stability of the considered fractional-order chaotic systems in the presence of uncertainty and external disturbance. Some numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASMC scheme. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84871366401	Robust position control of PMSM using fractional-order sliding Mode controller	A new robust fractional-order sliding mode controller (FOSMC) is proposed for the position control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). The sliding mode controller (SMC), which is insensitive to uncertainties and load disturbances, is studied widely in the application of PMSM drive. In the existing SMC method, the sliding surface is usually designed based on the integer-order integration or differentiation of the state variables, while in this proposed robust FOSMC algorithm, the sliding surface is designed based on the fractional-order calculus of the state variables. In fact, the conventional SMC method can be seen as a special case of the proposed FOSMC method. The performance and robustness of the proposed method are analyzed and tested for nonlinear load torque disturbances, and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is more robust and effective than the conventional SMC method. © 2012 Jiacai Huang et al.

84871749893	Stability and stabilization of fractional-order linear systems with convex polytopic uncertainties	This paper considers the problems of robust stability and stabilization for a class of fractional-order linear time-invariant systems with convex polytopic uncertainties. The stability condition of the fractional-order linear time-invariant systems without uncertainties is extended by introducing a new matrix variable. The new extended stability condition is linear with respect to the new matrix variable and exhibits a kind of decoupling between the positive definite matrix and the system matrix. Based on the new extended stability condition, sufficient conditions for the above robust stability and stabilization problems are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities by using parameter-dependent positive definite matrices.

84872831836	Hölder scales of sea level	The statistics of sea level is essential in the field of geosciences, ranging from ocean dynamics to climates. The fractal properties of sea level, such as long-range dependence (LRD) or long memory, 1/f noise behavior, and self-similarity (SS), are known. However, the description of its multiscale behavior as well as local roughness with the Hölder exponent h(t) from a view of multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) is rarely reported, to the best of our knowledge. In this research, we will exhibit that there is the multiscale property of sea level based on h(t)s of sea level data recorded by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) at six stations in the Florida and Eastern Gulf of Mexico. The contributions of this paper are twofold as follows. (i) Hölder exponent of sea level may not change with time considerably at small time scale, for example, daily time scale, but it varies significantly at large time scale, such as at monthly time scale. (ii) The dispersion of the Hölder exponents of sea level may be different at different stations. This implies that the Hölder roughness of sea level may be spatial dependent. © 2012 Ming Li et al.

Based on the concept of linear independency of interval vectors, we formulate the approach to check the robust controllability of interval FO-LTI stochastic systems by employing some simple but very effective sufficient condition for checking the linear independency of interval vectors. Finally, an illustrative example is presented.

84877926424	Fractional order constitutive model of geomaterials under thecondition of triaxial test	Fractional calculus has been successfully applied to characterize the rheological property of viscoelastic materials; however, geomaterials were seldom involved in fractional order constitutive models (FOCM), and the topic of first loading and then unloading is rarely discussed through fractional calculus. In this paper, mechanical properties are considered as a 'spectrum', both ends of which are elasticity and viscosity, and the fractional order can be utilized to describe such properties quantitatively. In addition to conditions such as creep, stress-relaxation, and constant-strain-rate loading, stress-strain relationship under the condition of first loading and then unloading was also derived using FOCM. FOCM is then adopted to simulate triaxial tests of geomaterials under corresponding conditions. A comparison of test and numerical results demonstrates that FOCM can reasonably describe the mechanical characteristics of geomaterials. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84877649994	Fractional order adaptive feed-forward cancellation for periodic disturbances	In this paper, a fractional order adaptive feed-forward cancellation (FO-AFC) scheme is proposed to cancel periodic disturbances. This FO-AFC offers one more tuning knob, the fractional order, for the performance improvement of the periodic disturbance cancellation, according to the interests of the users. The equivalence of the fractional order internal model principle (FO-IMP) scheme is derived for FO-AFC. So, the FO-IMP equivalence can be used to analyze the performance of the cancellation for the target periodic disturbance and the suppression for the harmonics and noise. Two FO-AFC cases, fractional order α ∈ (0, 1) and α ∈ (1, 2), are discussed for the performance analysis. FO-AFC with additional tuning knob α ∈ (0, 2) has many advantages, and it is much more flexible than the integer order adaptive feed-forward cancellation (IO-AFC) with only α = 1. Experimental results are presented to validate the performance analysis of FO-AFC compared with IO-AFC. © 2012 John Wiley and Sons Asia Pte Ltd and Chinese Automatic Control Society.

84878066192	Nonlinear dynamic analysis of a cracked rotor-bearing system with fractional order damping	Fatigue cracking of the rotor shaft is an important fault observed in the rotating machinery of key industries, which can lead to catastrophic failure. Nonlinear dynamics of a cracked rotor system with fractional order damping is investigated by using a response-dependent breathing crack model. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and tenth-order continued fraction expansion-Euler (CFE-Euler) method are introduced to simulate the proposed system equation of fractional order cracked rotors. The effects of the derivative order of damping, rotating speed ratio, crack depth, orientation angle of imbalance relative to the crack direction, and mass eccentricity on the system dynamics are demonstrated by using a bifurcation diagram, Poincaré map, and rotor trajectory diagram. The simulation results show that the rotor system displays chaotic, quasi-periodic, and periodic motions as the fractional order increases. It is also observed that the imbalance eccentricity level, crack depth, rotational speed, fractional damping, and crack angle all have considerable influence on the nonlinear behavior of the cracked rotor system. Finally, the experimental results verify the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.

84878362738	Genetic algorithm-based identification of fractional-order systems	Fractional calculus has become an increasingly popular tool for modeling the complex behaviors of physical systems from diverse domains. One of the key issues to apply fractional calculus to engineering problems is to achieve the parameter identification of fractional-order systems. A time-domain identification algorithm based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in this paper. The multi-variable parameter identification is converted into a parameter optimization by applying GA to the identification of fractional-order systems. To evaluate the identification accuracy and stability, the time-domain output error considering the condition variation is designed as the fitness function for parameter optimization. The identification process is established under various noise levels and excitation levels. The effects of external excitation and the noise level on the identification accuracy are analyzed in detail. The simulation results show that the proposed method could identify the parameters of both commensurate rate and non-commensurate rate fractional-order systems from the data with noise. It is also observed that excitation signal is an important factor influencing the identification accuracy of fractional-order systems. © 2013 by the authors.

The weight function is replaced by the truncated Fourier series, which is leading to three basic fractional order distributed parameter elements. The inverse Laplace transforms of the distributed parameter operators are derived by cutting the complex plane and computing the complex path integral along the Hankel path. The asymptotic property and boundary problem are discussed by using the inverse Laplace transform, the energy of the weight function and the band width of the Fourier series. The relaxation modulus of FOWDPMM is solved as well, which is closely related to some other viscoelastic phenomena as creep, precondition and hysteresis. A number of novel characteristics of FOWDPMM such as power-law decay and intermediate phenomenon are concluded as well. Several illustrated examples are provided to validate the concepts.

Since the traditional integer order (IO) reaching law can be considered as a special case of the FO reaching law, it is more likely for the FO reaching law to obtain better performance. The properties of the FO sign function are used to prove the capability of states to approach the switching manifolds. Compared with the IO sign function in the classical reaching law, the states reach the switching manifolds faster with the FO reaching law. It will be shown that the reaching time under the FO SMC can be reduced by analyzing the FO sign function under appropriate conditions. Moreover, the sliding dynamics can arrive at the equilibrium point more rapidly by applying the FO reaching law.

84899102376	Minimum energy cognitive lighting control: Stability analysis and experiments	Energy is one of the most important foundations of the world. However, the demand for lighting consumes a significant amount of electricity. In order to save lighting electricity and reduce cost, one obvious way is to supplement artificial light with natural light. The mixing of artificial and natural lighting, known as hybrid lighting, can be used to indoors for all lighting needs. In order to maintain the overall illumination level at the rated value, the amount of artificial light needs to change according to the varying natural light. To meet the desired energy saving potential, a suitable means for minimizing energy usage throughout the day must be developed. Minimum energy point tracking (MEPT) algorithms can be utilized to tackle this minimization problem. In this paper, a minimum energy cognitive lighting control prototype is proposed, designed and developed. A simple PID control law is implemented to maintain an arbitrary level of illumination while a sliding mode based extremum seeking controller (SM-ESC) is employed to minimize energy usage in the lights. Furthermore, this paper presents the experiment results of our MEPT research and tracking control for light level.
