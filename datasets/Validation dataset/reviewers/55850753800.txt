In this paper a video blind watermarking algorithm resistant to geometry transformation attacks is proposed. In the scheme of watermark embedding, video shot segmentation is used first. Then, background of a video segment in the video shot is extracted by independent component analysis(ICA).

84907885203	Identification method of freshwater fish species using multi-kernel support vector machine with bee colony optimization	Currently, the identification of freshwater fish species is conducted by people. Computer vision techniques can solve problems existing in identification by hand, such as a large amount of work and low precision. Firstly, freshwater fish are converted into an image signal. Then images are transmitted to the computer processing system to be analyzed and processed. The features of freshwater fish images are extracted, and the movements of the equipment are controlled according to the features. As a result, the production efficiency and production quality are improved by this substitute for the manual work. Thus, in order to identify freshwater fish species automatically and accurately, computer vision techniques are adopted and an identification method based on Krawtchouk moments, a gray level co-occurrence matrix, and a multi-kernel least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) with bee colony optimization is proposed. Firstly, gray level images of freshwater fish samples are obtained by camera, image acquisition card, and PC. Secondly, shape features such as the length to width ratio of freshwater fish and Krawtchouk moment invariants are calculated. The length to width ratio can be obtained by looking for the minimum circumscribed rectangle of fish. The fish head, fish body, and fish tail are obtained based on the minimum circumscribed rectangle. Then the Krawtchouk moment invariants of the fish head and those of the fish tail can be obtained. Thirdly, four characteristic parameters such as angular second moment, entropy, deficit moment, and variance based on a gray level co-occurrence matrix of the fish body are calculated, which are used as texture features. Finally, the above shape features and texture features are combined into a high dimensional feature vector. The feature vector is input into multi-kernel LS-SVM. In a multi-kernel LS-SVM, a polynomial kernel function and radial basis function kernel are used, which can make up for limitations of a single kernel function. The artificial bee colony algorithm is used to optimize the undetermined parameters in a multi-kernel LS-SVM. The identification accuracy of the test sample serves as a fitness function. The optimum parameters are output once the identification accuracy attains its maximum. Five freshwater fish species such as bream, bighead, crucian carp, grass carp, and black carp are identified by using the proposed method. A total of 190 fish were used as the research object. Among them, 70 fish were used as training samples, and the remaining 120 fish were used as testing samples. The experimental results showed that when bream, bighead, crucian carp, and grass carp are identified, the identification accuracy of them can all reach more than 95.83%. When bream, bighead, crucian carp, and black carp are identified, the identification accuracy of them can all reach more than 91.67%. When bream, bighead, crucian carp, grass carp, and black carp are identified, the identification accuracy of them can all reach more than 83.33%. In comparison with the freshwater fish identification method proposed recently, the back propagation (BP) neural network method, and the single kernel LS-SVM method, the proposed method has the higher identification accuracy. It indicates that the above shape features and texture features extracted can reflect the information of freshwater fish more comprehensively and effectively. Furthermore, the performance of a multi-kernel LS-SVM is much better than that of a single kernel LS-SVM. The proposed method is expected to find wide applications in a freshwater fish processing system.

84907920514	Threshold selection method based on reciprocal gray entropy and artificial bee colony optimization	Since the logarithmic form of Shannon entropy has the drawback of undefined value at zero points, and most existing threshold selection methods only depend on the probability information, ignoring the within-class uniformity of gray level, a method of reciprocal gray entropy threshold selection is proposed based on two-dimensional (2-D) histogram region oblique division and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization. Firstly, the definition of reciprocal gray entropy is introduced. Then on the basis of one-dimensional (1-D) method, 2-D threshold selection criterion function based on reciprocal gray entropy with histogram oblique division is derived. To accelerate the progress of searching the optimal threshold, the recently proposed ABC optimization algorithm is adopted.

A large number of experimental results show that, compared with the maximum Shannon entropy method with 2-D histogram oblique division and the reciprocal entropy method with 2-D histogram oblique division based on niche chaotic mutation particle swarm optimization (NCPSO), the proposed method can achieve better segmentation results and can satisfy the requirement of real-time processing.

77955836957	Image thresholding based on Î¸-division of 2-D histogram and maximum Shannon entropy	In view of the obvious wrong segmentation in commonly used region division of 2-D histogram and the non- universality of oblique segmentation method for image thresholding proposed recently, in this paper a much more widely suitable thresholding method is proposed based on the Î¸-division of 2-D histogram and the maximum Shannon entropy criterion. Firstly, the Î¸-division method of 2-D histogram is given. The region is divided by four parallel oblique lines and a line, where the angle between its normal line and gray level axis is Î¸ degrees. Image thresholding is performed according to pixel's weighted average value of gray level and neighbour average gray level. The oblique segmentation method can be regarded as a special case of the proposed method at Î¸=45Â°. Then the formulae and its fast recursive algorithm of the method are deduced. Finally the segmented results and the running time at different values of Î¸ are listed, which show that the segmented images achieve more accurate borders at smaller values of Î¸ and the anti-noise is better at larger values of Î¸. The value of Î¸ can be selected according to the real image characteristics and the requirements of segmented results. Compared with the algorithm of conventional 2-D maximum Shannon entropy method, the proposed method not only achieves more accurate segmentation results and more robust anti-noise, but also reduces the running time and memory space significantly.

84902762497	Remote sensing image fusion based on improved gradient projection NMF and complex Contourlet transform	In order to preserve both spectral and spatial information simultaneously in fused image, a method of remote sensing image fusion based on improved gradient projection Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Complex Contourlet Transform (CCT) was proposed. Firstly, the panchromatic image was histogram matched to the intensity component of multispectral image to obtain a new panchromatic image. Then, the intensity component of multispectral image and the new panchromatic image were decomposed by CCT, respectively. Corresponding low frequency images and high frequency images were obtained. Next, the new low frequency image was obtained by fusion of two low frequency images using improved gradient projection NMF, and the new high frequency image was obtained by fusion of two high frequency images with absolute maximum criterion. Finally, the fused image was reconstructed by inverse CCT and inverse Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) transform. A large number of experimental results show that, compared with other existing relative methods such as HSI method, the method combining NMF with nonsubsampled contourlet transform and the method combining lifting wavelet with HSI, the images fused by proposed method have higher spatial resolution and more spectral information.

84905010168	Robust edge detection based on anisotropic mathematical morphology and scale multiplication in NSCT domain	A novel edge detection method based on anisotropic mathematical morphology and scale multiplication in nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain is proposed to obtain a superior and robust performance under heavy noise. One preliminary result is obtained using anisotropic morphological gradient of the low-frequency component, yielding a single-pixel response with few pseudo edges. Due to the great ability of NSCT to localize distributed discontinuities such as edges, scale multiplication results of high-frequency components can get rid of a large amount of noise and produce well-localized edge candidates. The final result is a fusion of the detection results of low-frequency component and high-frequency components. Detailed experiments compared with other state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed method has a superior performance of edge detection and is quite robust even under heavy noise.

84905405485	Two-dimensional Arimoto gray entropy thresholding	A recently proposed 2D Arimoto entropy thresholding method only depends on frequency information of gray scale in an image, without considering uniformity of within-class gray scales. To solve this problem, a 2D Arimoto gray entropy thresholding method based on gray scale-gradient histogram is proposed. Uniformity of within-class gray scale is considered based on Arimoto entropy and a formula for 1D Arimoto gray entropy threshold selection constructed. Using regional division of object and background in a gray scale-gradient 2D histogram, a formula for 2D Arimoto gray entropy threshold selection is derived. Recursion formulae of intermediate variables in the threshold selection criterion function are used to eliminate redundant computation. The local period of an artificial bee colony algorithm is improved using a chaotic sequence based on tent mapping. The improved bee colony optimization algorithm can accelerate search speed of the optimal threshold for image segmentation to significantly reduce execution time. Experimental results based on a large number of typical images show that the proposed method can segment image quickly and accurately, with the overall performance better than 2D Shannon entropy thresholding, Tsallis gray entropy thresholding, and Arimoto entropy thresholding.

84907875257	Infrared image adaptive enhancement in Contourlet domain based on chaotic particle swarm optimization	To further enhance the contrast of infrared image, improve the definition and suppress the noise, an adaptive enhancement method in Contourlet domain based on chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. First, Contourlet transform of the infrared image is performed. The proportion of low-pass image and detail image in the original image is adjusted, and the contrast is enhanced by linear gray stretch. Then, the coefficients of noisy bandpass directional subbands are adjusted by nonlinear gain function. An integrated quantitative evaluation function is used as the fitness of the chaotic PSO. In this evaluation function three indexes are taken into account, i.e. contrast, definition and signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal parameters, involved in the enhancement method in spatial domain and the nonlinear gain function for adjustment of coefficients of bandpass directional subbands base on Contourlet, are obtained by chaotic PSO algorithm. Experimental results for a large number of infrared images show that, compared with four existing image enhancement methods, the proposed method improves the contrast of enhanced infrared image, increases the definition, reduces the noise, and has a better overall visual effect.

After infrared thermal wave image sequences are decomposed by nonsubsampled shearlet transform, dynamic weighted non-negative matrix factorization algorithm is adopted for fusion processing of low-frequency coefficients. The weighted coefficients of algorithm are adjusted dynamically according to the mutation degree of image pixel. As a result, the defect areas of infrared thermal image are highlighted.

The proposed method is fast and effective. It can keep the edges of infrared thermal images more complete and clear. In addition, the proposed method can be adopted for image fusion of multi infrared thermal image sequences effectively. Therefore, the proposed method has high practical value in the thermal wave nondestructive testing.

84916242154	Double watermarking algorithm based on support vector machine in complex Contourlet domain and Krawtchouk moment	In order to further improve the robustness of watermarking algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM), a double watermarking algorithm based on SVM in complex Contourlet domain and Krawtchouk moment is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the blue component and green component are extracted from the RGB host image. The algorithm makes full use of the invariance of Krawtchouk moment invariants to translation, rotation and scaling, and the better local reconstruction characteristics of Krawtchouk moment. The lower order Krawtchouk moment invariants of the blue component are calculated for construction of robust watermarking. Then the green component image is decomposed by two-level complex Contourlet transform. In the low-frequency components, the local correlation training model of image in the same scale is established by using support vector machine. The watermarking image is adaptively embedded and extracted according to the prediction results of the established model. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is not only invisible but also robust against the common image processing, such as median filtering, Gaussian noise and JPEG compression, and against some kinds of geometric attacks, including rotation, scaling and clipping. It outperforms the image watermarking algorithm based on support vector machine in wavelet domain or Contourlet domain.

84925243212	Edge detection of river in SAR image based on contourlet modulus maxima and improved mathematical morphology	To cope with the problems that edge detection operators are liable to make the detected edges too blurry for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, an edge detection method for detecting river in SAR images is proposed based on contourlet modulus maxima and improved mathematical morphology. The SAR image is firstly transformed to a contourlet domain.

The obtained river edges are complete and clear.

84925259908	Acknowledgement ground-based cloud using exponential entropy/exponential gray entropy and UPSO	Objective and accurate classification model or method of cloud image is a prerequisite for accurate weather monitoring and forecast. Thus safety of aircraft taking off and landing and air flight can be guaranteed. Thresholding is a kind of simple and effective method of cloud classification. It can realize automated ground-based cloud detection and cloudage observation. The existing segmentation methods based on fixed threshold and single threshold cannot achieve good segmentation effect. Thus it is difficult to obtain the accurate result of cloud detection and cloudage observation. In view of the above-mentioned problems, multi-thresholding methods of ground-based cloud based on exponential entropy/exponential gray entropy and uniform searching particle swarm optimization (UPSO) are proposed. Exponential entropy and exponential gray entropy make up for the defects of undefined value and zero value in Shannon entropy. In addition, exponential gray entropy reflects the relative uniformity of gray levels within the cloud cluster and background cluster. Cloud regions and background regions of different gray level ranges can be distinguished more precisely using the multi-thresholding strategy. In order to reduce computational complexity of original exhaustive algorithm for multi-threshold selection, the UPSO algorithm is adopted. It can find the optimal thresholds quickly and accurately. As a result, the real-time processing of segmentation of ground-based cloud image can be realized. The experimental results show that, in comparison with the existing ground-based cloud image segmentation methods and multi-thresholding method based on maximum Shannon entropy, the proposed methods can extract the boundary shape, textures and details feature of cloud more clearly. Therefore, the accuracies of cloudage detection and morphology classification for ground-based cloud are both improved.
