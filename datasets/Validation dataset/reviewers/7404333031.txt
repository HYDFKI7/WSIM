21144442849	Experimental investigation on instabilities of steam-water two-phase flow in large L/d inclined parallel upward smooth pipes	Experiments on instabilities of steam-water two-phase flow in inclined upward internally bare pipes have been performed on a high-pressure steam-water test loop. Different types of two-phase flow instabilities including pressure drop oscillation (PDO) and density wave oscillation (DWO) were observed. Experiments indicated that PDO happened without upstream compressible volume supplied by a surge tank when the rate of test pipe length and test pipe inner diameter L/d > 1200. The effects of system parameters such as system pressure, mass flow rate, heat flux and inlet sub-cooling are significant on both DWO and PWO. The analytical results showed that PDO happened at a lower exit quality and in the positive portion of the ΔP-G curves with both channel flow rates oscillation in phase, DWO happened at higher exit quality and in the negative portion of the ΔP-G curves with both channel flow rates oscillating out of phase. The investigation results indicated that the oscillation characteristics in inclined parallel upward smooth pipes were similar with in vertical parallel upward pipes.

0031358251	Experimental investigation of the measurement for oil, gas and water flowrates in three-phase slug flow	Three-phase flow of two immiscible liquids and a gas has been studied very little so far, even though this type of flow often occurs in the fields of petroleum production and boiling mixtures. A new method with the combination of horizontal-downward vertical tube and an orifice to measure the flowrates is presented. The measuring principle is that the frictional pressure drop in downward vertical tube is replaced by that in the horizontal tube, the void fraction is derived from the gravitational pressure drop, then the volume fraction of the individual phase can also be got. The individual flowrates can be calculated if the water fraction is available. This method is suitable to many kinds of oil wells to measure the flowrates of crude oil, natural gas and water. The parameters needing to be measured are less than that of other methods. According to the experimental results, this method has high accuracy, the measuring error is less than 10%, and it gets higher accuracy under the higher pressure conditions.

Experimental results showed that the system parameters had important effects on the two-phase flow instabilities both in the two types of tubes. The thresholds of heat flux of pressure drop oscillation in smooth tubes are smaller than that in the internally ribbed tubes; otherwise, the thresholds of density wave oscillation in internally ribbed tubes are smaller than that in the smooth tubes. Non-dimensional correlations of thresholds of heat flux both in the internally ribbed and the smooth tubes had been provided through the regression calculation of test data.

27544492293	Calculation of the temperature field distribution in an electrically heated inclined tube	Taking into account the impact of natural convection on the fluid heat transfer in an inclined riser tube the outer wall temperature and heat load are assumed as boundary conditions. Meanwhile, with the internal heat source being treated as a parallel-connected network resistance heat-release a two-dimensional mathematical model was set up for assessing the temperature field distribution in an electrically heated inclined tube. A controlled-volume differential method based on spatial node advance was used to solve the inverse problem of a two-dimensional temperature field heat conduction in an electrically heated inclined tube, which is determined by the coupling of fluid heat exchange and tube wall heat conduction. A computation program was prepared and the calculation of tube-wall temperature field conducted for the tube type of the spiral tube-coil water-wall of the first supercritical-parameter boiler in China. Under the operating condition of subcritical and supercritical pressures the calculation results can all truly reflect the wall-temperature distribution law of the inclined tube with a fairly good computation convergence being attained.

A method for resolving the discharging process of remainder oxidant in pump room was also presented. An example simulation was implemented for parts of the turbo-pump system of a liquid rocket engine during gliding before the second start-up of the engine. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data. It is showed that during gliding, the temperature of turbo decreases, while the temperature of pump and inlet tube increases. The remainder oxidant in pump room exhausts discontinuously. It can be seen that temperature for the turbo, pump and inlet tube is higher than 100°C and the quality in pump room is 1 at the end of gliding, obviously, which can not meet conditions of the second start-up.

33750217512	Hydrodynamic model of slug flow in vertical pipes considering variable thickness of liquid film	Based on analysis of flow mechanism, a hydrodynamic model of slug flow in vertical pipes was developed considering the variable thickness of liquid film. Effects of film thickness on results were discussed and the model was evaluated with experimental data available from the literature. It was found that if the variation of thickness was neglected, and Taylor bubble was considered as a cylindrical bubble, the length of Taylor bubble would be under predicted. The simplification can also result in an over prediction of pressure gradient, and the deviation will increase as gas superficial velocity increases for a fixed liquid superficial velocity. The improved model takes into account the flow characteristic of liquid film, and can predict the data obtained from different sources with a fairly well accuracy.

The analysis results show that this model is relative to few parameters and easy to calculate, and the test data from different sources can be predicted with fairly well precision. In addition, much difference results can be achieved by variant correlations for liquid holdup in liquid slug, but the prediction of pressure gradient is not sensitive to the liquid holdup under the experimental conditions.

34547769739	Numerical calculation of temperature fields on a non-uniformly heated tube wall	In the light of the non-uniform distribution of thermodynamic parameters, such as circumferential wall temperature of the non-uniformly heated tube wall and heat load etc., a two-dimensional mathematical model was established for simulating and calculating the temperature field of a non-uniformly heated tube with the outer wall temperature and heat-dispersion thermal load serving as boundary conditions. Based on the idea of radial node advancement, the authors have adopted a finite volume method to set up a discrete equation. A numerical calculation program was prepared to solve the reverse problem of heat conduction in the two-dimensional temperature field on the non-uniformly heated tubes determined by the coupling of the fluid heat exchange and tube wall heat conduction. By making use of the program, calculated was the heat transfer characteristics of semi-circle heated vertical riser (bare tube φ32 × 3 mm and φ24 × 4 mm) with respect to supercritical water. The calculation results can exceedingly well reflect the wall temperature distribution regularity of non-uniformly heated tubes and exhibit a good computation convergence. The results of calculation also indicate that at a supercritical pressure, the semi-circle heated vertical bare-riser wall temperature and wall surface heat load assume a non-uniform circumferential distribution. The side with a high heat load has a high temperature and the side with a low heat load a low temperature. In the pseudocritical zone, a heat transfer intensification occurs and an increase of in-tube heat transfer coefficient will weaken the flow-equalizing role of heat along the circumferential direction of tube walls.

The results show that as the liquid-film Reynolds number increases, the condensation heat transfer coefficient increases; and the condensation heat transfer coefficient of corrugated tube is greater than that of smooth tube. The corrugated tube improves the condensation heat transfer outside tube. This improvement of corrugated tube for water is more obvious than that for kerosene.

Tests show that the flow pattern, the jet's depth of penetration and the extent of the affected region remain the same if the velocity ratio is kept constant; while increasing the velocity ratio causes the jet's penetration depth to extend, flow deflection to diminish and flow along the manifold's wall to reduce. Test results were a valuable guide for positioning temperature sensors in succeeding heat transfer tests, which served the purpose of providing data for structural fatigue safety analysis of the injector's connection piping with the reactor, and thus may serve as basic reference material for the reactor's structural design.

43049180031	Experimental investigation on heat transfer characteristics in a safety injection nozzle component in PWR	Thermal fatigue is a potentially significant degradation mechanism in Nuclear Power Plants (NPP). For the fatigue analysis, the thermal load information about components must be determined firstly. In this paper, an experimental study was carried out to obtain local fluid temperatures and local heat transfer coefficients for the safety injection nozzle component in reactor coolant system (RCS). In this mixing tee component a hot jet issues into a cold cross-flow stream from an oblique pipe and the turbulent mixing of two fluids induces local cycling stresses on the adjacent piping wall. Experiments were performed using a special-made heat fluxmeter, which can measure the mixed fluid temperature close to the wall and the heat transfer coefficient between the fluid and the wall. Plexiglass and metallic 1/9-scale mockups were manufactured for flow visualization and heat transfer tests, respectively. All tests were conducted at range of 0-40 for the jet-to-cross-flow velocity ratio. The flow visualization test has obtained general pattern of the flow and identified sensitive zones in the component where the jet and cross-flow interact intensively to cause thermal fatigue more possibly. In the heat transfer test, heat fluxmeters were positioned in the wall at these sensitive zones. The measurement results of temperatures and heat transfer coefficients have been discussed in detail in the paper. These experimental results allow us improving the state of knowledge of the thermal load to be used in the industrial mixing tees in operating for long lifetime assessment and for the design in the basic Nuclear Power Plants. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The characteristics of heat transfer, pressure drop and coke of kerosene and its main influence factors are revealed, and the enhanced heat transfer mechanism of rough surface and the influence of different roughness are analyzed. A comparison with smooth channel with the same size shows that the heat transfer coefficient of rough surface channel is 1.4-1.9 times of smooth channel, the friction factors is 1.3-3.8 times, and the average wall temperature of rough surface channel is markedly lower than that of smooth channel under the same conditions, thus rough surface enables to enhance the heat transfer ability of kerosene, as well as the coke heat flux.

With the same parameters as the experiment, two-phase flow density wave oscillation in parallel inclined inner ribbed pipes was analyzed and solved in this paper. The variation of the working fluid inlet velocity perturbation with time was found using the time domain method.

Experiments were carried out with PIV (particle image velocimetry) system and infrared thermo tracer to visualize the flow field and the temperature distribution of two slotted fin surfaces. The experiment results showed that the fluctuation intensity and pressure drop of the X-type slotted fin surface were higher than those of the arc-type slotted fin surface. However, the heat transfer performance and field synergy property of the X-type slotted fin surface were superior to those of the arc-type fin surface. A new definition of fluctuation intensity was proposed to indicate the magnitude of flow disturbance enforced by the configuration and arrangement of slotted fin surface. The higher the fluctuation intensity, the larger the velocity gradient and the vorticity magnitude. The visualization experiment results provide a reliable experimental support for later numerical simulation and optimization design for new fin structures.

The experimental results show that the nondimensional velocity and temperature fluctuation intensity of the X-type slotted fin surface are higher than those of the Arc-type slotted fin surface and the integrated heat transfer performance of the former one is superior to that of the latter one. But the pressure drop of the former one is higher than that of the latter one. According to the merits of the two slotted fin surfaces, a new type slotted fin surface (X-Arc-wavy type) was designed.

Numerical simulation results show that the nondimensional space fluctuation intensity and the integrated heat transfer performance of the optimized fin surface is better than those of the other two slotted fin surfaces.

It was found that in the downstream of the hot jet when velocity ratio is larger than 0.40, the core of the hot jet is away from the wall. The temperature distribution at the inlet of the hot jet is quite uneven when velocity ratio is small and there is turbulent region inside the hot jet tube.

Determined was the influence of pressure, mass flow speed, inlet supercooling degree and upstream compressible volume on the pressure drop pulsation of the above tubes. The research results show that with an increase of the pressure, the critical heat load at which a pulsation occurs will increase, the limit dryness will gradually go up, and the system stability will be improved. The pulsation period will be first extended and then shortened with the amplitude of the pulsation being gradually diminished. In the present experiment, when the pressure is greater than 6 MPa, no pressure drop pulsation will occur. With an increase of the mass flow speed, the limit heat load at which a pulsation occurs will increase while the pulsation period will diminish. The inlet supercooling degree will exercise a monodromy influence over the density wave pulsation. With an increase of the inlet supercooling degree, the limit heat load will mono-tonically increase and the change of the limit dryness will exhibit different tendencies. At a relatively low mass flow speed, with an increase of the supercooling degree, the limit dryness will diminish monotonically. At a relatively high mass flow speed, with an increase of the supercooling degree, the limit dryness will rise monotonically. The upstream compressible volume will have a relatively small influence on the limit heat load. With an increase of the gas-filling ratio, the pulsation period and amplitude will also gradually increase.

77950183502	Experimental investigation of two-phase flow pressure-drop type instabilities in parallel vertical internally ribbed pipes at low mass flow rate	The research covers the experimental investigation of two-phase flow instabilities in parallel vertical internally ribbed pipes at low mass flow rate in the high-pressure steam-water test loop. The tested tube is an outlet diameter of 28.6 mm and a wall thinkness of 5.8 mm. The pressure-drop type oscillations are found in the experiments. The effects of pressure, mass flow rate and inlet subcooling on instabilities are studied. The results show that the boundary heat flux of pressure-drop type oscillations increase with increase of inlet pressure, mass flow rate and inlet subcooling. It is found that sysetem pressure, inlet subcooling and mass flow rate have great effects on amplitudes and periods of two-phase flow instabilities. In addition, it is found that the effects of pressure on periods of pressure-drop type oscillations represent two different trends in the test. When pressure is lower then 4 Mpa, the periods of pressure-drop type oscillation increase with pressure increasing, but when pressure is higher then 4 Mpa, the oscillation periods decrease with pressure increasing. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

77956946285	Numerical simulation on near wall fluid temperature of non-isothermal jet with cross-flow for safety injection inclined tube in reactors	In order to obtain the characteristics of the near wall fluid temperature variation and distribution of non-isothermal jet with cross-flow for the safety injection (SI) inclined tube with 45o angle in reactor, the numerical simulations were carried out at the velocity ratio range from 0.87 to 40 and when the temperature differences between jet flow and main flow were 30 and 70°C. The numerical simulations were performed at 1/9-scale model using the commercial computational fluid dynamics software CFX. Based on the calculation results, the mixing function of near wall fluid in different regions of SI inclined tube was obtained. Through the comparison of the mixing function of near wall fluid in different region at 30 and 70°C temperature differences, it was discovered that the mixing function values of each measurement point at 30 and 70°C temperature differences were basically changeless, namely, the effect of the temperature difference on the mixing function of each measurement point was small. The calculation results of the mixing function agreed well with the test ones.

77956960822	Comparison studies on flow and heat transfer characteristics in near wall region for jet flow with different injection angle	To the flow and heat transfer characteristics in near wall region for jet flow with different injection angle in the reactor coolant system, based on the test results, the flow characteristics and mixing function and non-dimensional heat transfer coefficient in different regions of T junction components with 45° and 90° injection angle were compared and analyzed at the velocity ratio range from 0 to 2. The research results indicated that the effect of the injection angle on the change trend of the mixing function and non-dimensional heat transfer coefficient is small, and the key parameter determining the change trend is still the velocity ratio. The effect of the injection angle is only on the values of the mixing function and non-dimensional heat transfer coefficient.

78049394706	Numerical study on thermal design for a DLP projector	Due to its compact size and high-resolution video output, digital light processor (DLP) video projector has become more popular in the current market. However, reducing projector size generates a problem of more heat dissipation being crowded into less space and leads to the need for an effective heat removal mechanism. As a result, this numerical investigation is aimed to examine and enhance the thermal management of a DLP projector. at first, numerical simulation on a DLP projector is performed by using a CFD code. Later, the detailed velocity, pressure, and temperature distributions are visualized numerically and utilized to identify the components in which their temperatures are higher than the thermal-design limitations stated in DLP products thermal design guide. These high-temperature regions include color-wheel motor, cooling fan, and exhaust fan. Furthermore, based on this numerical outcome, several modifications are proposed to improve the flow patterns associated with these ill-design portions. Among them, the appropriate guide plate is added to prevent the airflow circulation within the projector that causes extreme temperatures for components in the affected area. Also, the extra vent area is placed near the inlet region of cooling fan to reduce the system resistance and ensure that the airflow is replaced by the cooler intake air. Thereafter, numerical simulations are executed to validate the corresponding improvements generated by those new alternatives. In conclusion, simulation results show that significant temperature drops (roughly 30∼45°C) on color-wheel motor and cooling fans are achieved. Copyright © 2008 by Lin, Sheam-Chyun.

79956197676	Research on pressure-drop type instabilities between different parallel vertical rifled tubes at lower mass velocity	An experimental study was carried out on the pressure-drop type instabilities of the two-phase flow of the parallel vertical rifled tube in the high-pressure vapor-water test loop. The comparison of the effects of two types of tubes on the two-phase flow instabilities have been conducted. The results show that with the increase of inlet pressure and mass flow rate, the boundary heat flux of pressure-drop type oscillations increases; the boundary dryness thresholds of pressure-drop type oscillations increase with the increase of inlet pressure. In addition, with the increase of mass flow rat, the boundary dryness thresholds of pressure-drop type oscillations are increased with rifled tube of Φ31.8 mm×6 mm, but first increased and then decreased for the rifled tube of Φ28.6 mm×5.8 mm. It is also found that the range of the boundary dryness thresholds and the periods of the oscillations of pressure-drop type oscillations for two types of tubes are similar. Under the same operation parameters, the rifled tube of Φ31.8 mm×6 mm is more stable.

79956205284	Numerical simulation of flow characteristics of lean jet to cross-flow in safety injection of reactor cooling system	In the present work, a numerical simulation was performed to study the flow characteristics of lean jet to cross-flow in a main tube in the safety injection of reactor cooling system. The influence scope and mixing characteristics of the confined lean jet in cross-flow were studied. It can be concluded that three basic flow regimes are marked, namely the attached lean jet, lift-off lean jet and impinging lean jet. The velocity ratio VR is the key factor in the flow state. The depth and region of jet to main flow are enhanced with the increase of the velocity ratio. The jet flow penetrates through the main flow with the increase of the velocity ratio. At higher velocity ratio, the jet flow strikes the main flow bottom and circumfluence happens in upriver of main flow. The vortex flow characteristics dominate the flow near region of jet to cross-flow and the mixture of jet to cross-flow. At different velocity ratio VR, the vortex grows from the same displacement, but the vortex type and the vortex is different. At higher velocity ratio, the vortex develops fleetly, wears off sharp and dies out sharp. The study is very important to the heat transfer experiments of cross-flow jet and thermal stress analysis in the designs of nuclear engineering.

0035918471	The measurement of two-phase flow dryness by the use of a dual-throttle element	Based on a model of classical uniform-phase flow and divided-phase flow the authors have deduced a formula for the direct measurement of dual-phase flow under an ideal condition. The applicable scope of usage of the formula is analyzed. An experimental device has been designed, which incorporates a horizontal orifice plate and a vertical descending Venturi tube connected in series. An experimental study was conducted with air and water serving as working mediums. The results of the study indicate that the pressure drop characteristics of the vertical descending Venturi tube in a ring-shaped flow zone have been found to be more approximate to the calculation results of the uniform-phase flow model. Under the proposed method the relative error of measurement within the range of dryness given in the paper is smaller than ± 10%.

0036558831	Friction and heat transfer characteristics of transverse tube with large roughness	Investigations were carried out, under uniform wall temperature and constant heat flux boundary conditions, on heat transfer and frictional characteristics of transverse tube with large roughness for laminar and turbulent flow of oil in a condensation test facility. The parameters tested were Re=50-6200, Pr=75-260, roughness height e=5 mm, and pitch p=30 mm. The experimental results show that the frictional and heat transfer characteristic of test tube differed greatly with those of conventional enhanced tubes, which use water or air as working fluid, due to the interaction of its special geometrical configurations and oil thermal properties. Also, the difference in friction and heat transfer data by using different test methods was found to be extremely small. The correlations of dimensionless friction factors and heat transfer coefficients were proposed on the basis of experimental data. Finally the experimental data were compared with computational results obtained by Ravigururajan and Bergles correlation.

0036587298	Research on combined power and cooling system using ammonia-water mixtures	A new combined thermal power and cooling system is developed using the characteristic of low boiling non-azeotropic ammonia-water mixtures. This cycle may produce power as well as refrigeration using relatively low temperature heat sources ranging from 400-450 K. The overall efficiency is 7% higher than the direct power generation with the same heat sources. Solar energy, geothermal and waste heat from power plant may be utilized efficiently. The relationship of the system parameters such as turbine inlet pressure, outlet pressure, temperature of heat source and absorber and the effect of these parameters on the cycle efficiency are analyzed through numerical simulation. The results show that higher initial pressure and lower exhaust pressure will increase the system thermal efficiency linearly, while increase of initial temperature will get higher efficiency first and than decrease gradually.

0036621550	Experimental study on heat transfer characteristic of T-junction in cooling system of PWR	The near wall local fluid temperature and heat transfer coefficient distribution in three different areas were measured for T-junction with and without thermal sleeve where jet injected vertically down to the main flow. Flows with velocity ratio between 0.01 and 1.5 were measured. The diameter ratio of jet pipe to main pipe is 0.16. It is found at that downstream of the jet the thermal sleeve has little effect on heat transfer coefficient and near wall fluid temperature. The thermal sleeves effect is more marked when the velocity ratio becomes larger.

0036621611	Numerical and experimental investigation of flow and heat transfer in a T-junction with thermal sleeve	Numerical simulations were performed with the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package FLUENT 5.3 to investigate the thermal-hydraulic phenomena of thermal shock, which is caused by non-isothermal turbulent jet into crossflow in a T-junction with thermal sleeve in the pressurized water reactor (PWR) cooling system. In allusion to the thermal sleeve configuration with vent holes and lower collar, two typical cases with jet-to-mainstream velocity ratios of 0.05 and 0.5 were computed. Experimental studies were carried out to determine the heat transfer characteristics for the main pipe and the annulus between the nozzle and the thermal sleeve. The calculations well match the experimental data. The results indicate that the protective action of the thermal sleeve against thermal shock loading is dependent on both the sleeve geometry and the velocity ratio, obtaining improvement with appropriate lower velocity ratios. In addition, optimal flow rates and partial sizes of the thermal sleeve were discussed to reduce the thermal shock.

0036552788	Numerical simulation of heat transfer characteristics of RPV downcomer in PWR under PTS	Numerical simulation by using the commercial computational fluid dynamics software FLUENT 5.4, combined with the heat transfer experiments with the 1:10 setup at ambient pressure, were performed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic phenomena of the pressurized thermal shock (PTS), which is caused by the cold safety injection fluid direct into the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) downcomer in the pressurized water reactor (PWR). Heat transfer characteristics in the RPV downcomer were studied at the typical case with the superficial velocity in the downcomer 0.5 m/s and the safety injection velocity 10 m/s. The calculations well matches the experimental data. Via analysis of the flow characteristics and fluid mixing behavior, it was explained from the flow mechanism that intensive heat transfer takes place near the quasi-reattachment point of the RPV downcomer. The results may be used for further thermal shock analysis.

79958698878	Experimental investigation of two-phase flow instabilities in low-mass-flux water wall tubes of supercritical circular fluidized bed boilers	For the purpose of disclosing the hydrodynamic flow characteristics, under the low mass velocity conditions of the 600-MW supercritical circular fluidized beds boilers, experimental studies on instability of two-phase flow in parallel vertical internally ribbed tubes were conducted. Two kinds of oscillations, pressure-drop oscillation and density-wave oscillation, have been observed. In the range of test parameters the effects of pressure, mass flux, inlet subcooling, compressible volume, exit throttle, and asymmetric heat flux to the two-phase instability were explored and analyzed. Indications from experiment data are: To increase system pressure, mass flux and inlet subcooling will intensify the stability of water wall tubes. To increase exit throttle will intensify the instability of water wall tubes. The bounding pressure and bounding mass flux of density-wave oscillations and the bounding pressure of pressure-drop oscillation have been obtained. Based on the results of testing and using a homogeneous model, the threshold relational expressions of instability were obtained. The results may be used for the design and safe operation of parallel vertical rifled water wall tubes of supercritical circular fluidized beds boilers. Copyright © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

80051528440	An investigation on heat transfer to water flowing in vertical upward internally ribbed enhancement tube at supercritical pressure	Within the range of pressure from 21 to 35 MPa, mass velocity from 600 to 1800 kg/(m2s), and the internal wall heat flux from 200 to 600 kW/m2, the heat transfer of near-critical and supercritical water flowing in vertical upward internally ribbed enhancement tubes was studied experimentally. The outer diameter of the tube is 28.6 mm, the equivalent diameter is 15.24 mm, and the wall thickness is 5.8 mm. The experimental study results show that internally ribbed tube can noticeably enhance heat transfer and can effectively inhibit the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB). Heat transfer enhancement of the internally ribbed tube decreased near the critical pressure. The enhancement rapidly diminishes and the deterioration of heat transfer transfers occurs in the sub-cooled region at pressure above 20.6 MPa. In supercritical pressure, pressure has only a moderate effect on the heat transfer of supercritical water when the temperature of water is below the pseudocritical point. At a higher pressure, the sharp rising of the wall temperature near the pesudocritical region occurs earlier. The enhancement of mass velocity increase is much stronger below the pesudocrotical point than that above the pesudocritical point. For a given pressure and mass velocity, the internal wall heat flux also shows significant effect on the internal wall temperature, with a high internal wall heat flux leading to a higher internal wall temperature. Increasing of internal wall heat flux leads to an early occurrence of sharp rising of the wall temperature. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.

0036770390	Digital particle imaging velocimetre experimental study of the jet-to-crossflow in a T-junction with a sleeve tube	In order to understand the hydraulic mechanism of thermal shock caused by cold jet injection in a T-junction with thermal sleeve in the reactor cooling system, experiments were carried out on the jet-to-cross flow with a sleeve tube by using the digital particle imaging velocimetre (DPIV) to measure the flow in the main duct and in the annular space of the sleeve tube. The velocity and vorticity distributions were investigated at the jet-to-cross flow velocity ratio R of 0.5-4. The complex vortical structures in the main duct, together with the flow characteristics in the sleeve annular, were analyzed. It was found that, from the annular space at the rear part of the sleeve near the jet exit, there was a stream of discharge, which was in favor of decreasing the influence of jet on the downstream wall. The intensive vortex in the near wake mainly originated from the shear layer vorticity of the jet in the hole and the annular discharge stream. It soon broke down and dispersed, and further developed into the counter-rotating vortex pair in the far wake. The flow in the annular was closely dependent on R, and the sleeve's thermal protection would be evident at a higher R.

84867231272	Experimental study of two-phase flow instability of vertical parallel rifled tube with different sizes at low-mass flow rate	Under certain operating conditions, two-phase flow oscillations can occur and induce undesired problems such as system control, vibration, tube burn-out, etc. Therefore, it is essential to avoid and control two-phase flow instabilities when designing and operating equipments that are susceptible to such effects. The authors conducted an experimental study of vapor-liquid two-phase flow instabilities in vertical parallel tubes for a high-pressure vapor-water loop. Two types of vertical parallel rifled tubes (31.8 mm OD × 6 mm thickness, and 28.6 mm × 5.8 mm) were used as the tube sections. During experimentation, pressure-drop and density-wave type oscillations appeared, and the influence of the inlet pressure, mass flow rate, and inlet subcooling on the two-phase flow instability in both types of vertical parallel-connected tubes was studied. The results showed that with an increase in the inlet pressure and mass flow rate, the boundary thermal load of the pressure-drop and density-wave oscillations increased. As the inlet pressure increased, so the boundary quality of the pressure-drop and density-wave oscillations occurring in both types of the rifled tubes also increased. Experiments showed that under the same operating conditions, the stability of the 31.8 × 6 mm rifled tube is better than the 28.6 × 5.8 mm rifled tube. For the 31.8 × 6 mm rifled tube, the occurrence of the boundary quality of the pressure-drop type oscillation increased with the increasing mass flow rate. However, for the 28.6 × 5.8 mm rifled tube, the occurrence of the boundary quality of the pressure-drop oscillation first increased and then decreased with an increasing mass flow. © 2011 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

To investigate the fluid flow behaviors, experiments with different system pressures (near-critical and supercritical pressure) were conducted on the Xi'an Jiao tong University's (XJTU) supercritical water test facility. Large amplitudes of mass flow flux as well as inlet pressure were found in various operation conditions. Mechanism of this unusual flow instability behavior is discussed.

84883885040	Influence of elevator moving pattern on the contaminant exclusion for an LCD panel delivery facility	Because of the increasing panel size, the difficulty on delivering the glass substrate has been enhanced dramatically and become a critical problem in the LCD manufacturing industry. Nowadays, most of panel fabrication factory utilize the fully-automated delivering technology instead of the traditional labor delivery for diminishing the possibility of polluted particles on the LCD board. Thus, this study investigates the flow patterns on maintaining the air quality inside the delivering facility with a moving elevator. Also, influence on the moving pattern of the elevator via numerical technique is the focus of this investigation. Firstly, CFD code Fluent is used to execute the CFD simulation and evaluate the flow patterns inside this delivery equipment. It is found that the inferior air is generated mainly by the increasing vortex inside the delivery equipment for an upward-moving elevator. On the contrary, the flow field becomes very smooth without obvious vortex phenomenon, and thus induces a better air quality when the elevator moves downward. However, a better uniform flow field occurred when the elevator is moving upward. In addition, the airflow uniformity is not effectively improved by reducing the elevator velocity and increasing the FFU airflow velocity. It is not evident for improving the pollute exclusion by reducing elevator moving velocity which slows down the transporting efficiency, so it is suggested that the moving speed of elevator should maintain at 0.16m/s. On another way, it is useful to enhance the capability of pollute exclusion by increasing the FFU's air velocity, thus it is proposed to raise FFU velocity to 0.71m/s. Consequently, it is concluded that the moving pattern of elevator has an essential impact and can be utilized to improve the air quality inside the LCD delivery facility. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.

The maximum temperature differences and velocity distribution along the surge line axis under different velocities were obtained. Comparative analysis indicates that replacing current smooth tube with screw pipe can enhance the turbulent flow and the mixing effects between the hot and cold fluids. The temperature differences in flow cross-sections along the screw surge line axis are reduced by about 1/3 compared with current smooth surge line, yielding effectively mitigation to the influence of thermal stratification.

84904562567	Experimental investigation of thermal stratification in a pressurizer surge line	Thermal stratified flow in a pressurizer surge line was investigated on a 1/3 scaled model based on the Richardson number similarity. A database which could be used to verify the thermal stratification simulation was established. Temperature distributions inside and on the outer surface of a surge line pipe with different surge line inlet flow rates were monitored and compared. Thermal stratification occupied a large part of the surge line. Temperature differences at all the measured test sections reached half of the maximum inlet temperature difference. As the surge line inlet velocity increased, the pattern of temperature distribution showed a similar trend and the cross-section maximum temperature difference changed little. This was consistent with the existence of thermal stratification at operating conditions in the corresponding pressurized water reactor. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The flow and vorticity characteristics were investigated at jet-to-crossflow velocity ratios of 0.5 to 4. There was a stream of discharge from the annular space at the rear part of the sleeve near the jet exit, which resulted in decreasing the influence of the jet on the downstream wall. The intensive vorticity in the near wake mainly originated from the shear layer vorticity of the jet and the annular discharge stream. The intensive vorticity soon broke down and dissipated, and further developed into the counterrotating vortex pair in the far wake. The flow in the annulus was closely dependent on R, and thermal protection of the sleeve would become evident at higher R. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
