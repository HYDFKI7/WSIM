84938096279	Synthesis of MnO<inf>x</inf>-CeO<inf>2</inf>·NO<inf>x</inf> catalysts by polyvinylpyrrolidone-assisted supercritical antisolvent precipitation	A series of MnO x-CeO2 binary oxide catalysts were synthesized by polyvinylpyrrolidone -assisted supercritical antisolvent precipitation and the effects of the manganese (Mn)/cerium (Ce) molar ratio and calcination temperature on the structure and properties of MnO x-CeO2 were investigated. A solid solution was obtained at each experimental condition and the highest surface area of 107.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g was obtained at the Mn/Ce molar ratio of 3:5 and the calcination temperature of 400°C. Low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides, namely NO, NO2, and N2O (deNO x) with ammonia (NH3) to convert them into nitrogen and water, was used as model reaction to evaluate MnO x-CeO2 catalytic performance. It is found that the activity first increased and then decreased with increasing Mn content and decreased with increasing calcination temperature. The highest catalytic activity (93.3% NO conversion and 100% N2 selectivity) was obtained at the Mn/Ce molar ratio of 1/1 and the calcination temperature of 400°C, which was attributed to the combination of high surface area and high redox performance of the catalyst.

0031200135	New process of condensation reaction-separation of phenol and acetone in multistage trickle bed reactor	A new process of condensation reaction-separation of phenol and acetone in multistage trickle bed reactor has been developed. The problems of the fixed bed reactor with resin catalyst in production of BPA were resolved successfully. The influence of the technological conditions on condensation effect, such as reaction temperature, molar ratio of phenol to acetone, residence time and nitrogen flow rate was analyzed. The produced water was stripped and separated by nitrogen, the reaction temperature and molar ratio of phenol to acetone in the multistage trickle bed reactor were well distributed. By even mixing of the granulated packing with the catalyst, the transfer processes were intensified and the pressure drop of catalyst layers was cut down. Model experiment shows that the reaction and separation process in production of BPA with the multistage trickle bed reactor caused high concentration of condensation product, high conversion, high selectivity and high capacity of catalyst.

It was found that the simulation results are sensitive to the turbulence model selection, and realizable k-ε model was considered as the best turbulence model by comparing the CFD results of heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop with empirical method results. The simulation results show that the velocity and temperature distribution vary along axial and radial direction, and there are stagnation regions before and behind the baffles, in which the heat transfer coefficient is low; but high heat transfer was observed in cross flow zones and baffle cut zones. Finally, the validity of the CFD results was confirmed by comparing its results of outlet temperature, total pressure drop and average heat transfer coefficient with empirical method results under different heat flux and inlet velocity conditions. The calculating results have a good agreement with the results of empirical methods.

71649094664	Intensifying esterification reaction between lactic acid and ethanol by pervaporation dehydration using chitosan-TEOS hybrid membranes	Esterification assisted by pervaporation separation can enhance the yield of ester for thermodynamically or kinetically limited reaction via selective removal of water from the reaction mixture. In the present study, organic-inorganic hybrid membranes were prepared by in situ hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) within chitosan (CS) aqueous solution for pervaporation-assisted esterification of lactic acid with ethanol, catalyzed by Amberlyst 15 ion-exchange resin. The composition and structural properties of CS-TEOS hybrid membranes were investigated by FT-IR, XRD, TGA and contact angle. The dehydration performances of hybrid membranes were evaluated by pervaporation of aqueous ethanol solution. Comparing with CS pristine membrane, CS-TEOS hybrid membranes exhibited remarkably enhancing pervaporation property. Pervaporation-assisted esterification results suggested that the incorporation of pervaporation process to preferentially remove water from the reaction mixture substantially enhanced the yield of ethyl lactate from 66 wt.% to 80 wt.%. The effects of membrane casting solution recipe, reaction temperature, initial molar ratio of ethanol to lactic acid and catalyst loading amount on the process performance have been examined in detail. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

74449089359	A curve fitting method of quantifying green fluorescent protein expression level in Escherichia coli	Green fluorescent protein (GFP) has all the essential properties of a quantitative reporter protein and the fluorescence of GFP is a reliable and quantitative reporter of underlying differences in expression levels. However, GFP fluorescence does not increase with cell density in direct proportion because of its fluorescence quenching. And the fluorescence quenching is always ignored by most GFP fluorescence assays that provide a measure of average fluorescence intensity over an entire sample cell population. We now propose a novel method that accurately quantifies the fluorescence intensity of GFP expressed in Escherichia coli by a fluorescence spectrophotometer. In our method, a cell containing GFP was regarded as a fluorochrome and the data processing was essentially different from the previous methods. The experimental assay data were curve fitted to calibrate the mean fluorescence intensity of a cell population. Thus, the impact of fluorescence quenching caused by cell density was amended. Moreover, the mean fluorescence intensity of a cell population was roughly proportional to the fluorescence quantum efficiency, a property of a fluorochrome, so it can be used to evaluate the GFP expression level in a given cell population. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77955598063	Bioethanol production in China	As a result of air clean regulations, agricultural interests, and energy security needs, the production of Bio-ethanol which can be used as an automotive fuel by itself or mixed with conventional fuels, becomes more and more necessary. There were no professional fuel ethanol plants in China before 2000. After nearly 8 years of development, the output of production of fuel ethanol in China has reached 1.02 million tons per year by the end of 2006, and the fuel ethanol production technology is becoming more mature. China has become the third producer of fuel ethanol in the world. Nowadays the most important issue that China fuel ethanol industry facing is the challenge of the diversification of raw materials. From the end of 2006, China government no longer approved the construction of ethanol plants using corn as feedstock. Cassava, sweet potato and sweet sorghum began to become the most competitive raw materials. The fuel ethanol plant of 200,000 MTA using cassava as feedstock, is being under construction in Guangxi province by Biological Energy limited Company of COFCO, and is going to startup in the end of 2007. PetroChina is preparing to build a number of fuel ethanol plants with raw materials of sweet potato.

78650412870	Importance of dynamics in electron excitation and transfer of organic dyes	Electron excitation and transfer of a triphenylamine derivative, triazine, anthraquinone, oxadiazole, triazine-anthraquinone, and triazine-oxadiazole were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations based on the B3LYP functional. The difference of the excitation wavelengths for anthraquinone using two basis sets, 6-311+G(d,p) and 6-31+G(d,p), was found to be within 4 nm. This indicates 6-31+G(d,p) can produce reasonable results and therefore is appropriate to use in calculations of large systems. The solvent effect on the electron excitation of these six molecules was investigated using three solvents: chloroform, dichloromethane, and ethanol. A red shift in excitation wavelength and enhanced absorption intensity were found in solution with respect to in vacuo condition. Furthermore, we introduced the concept of optically dynamic molecular orbitals (ODMOs) to account for the dynamic effect on electron transfer processes, which is critical in the interpretation of the results. A new dyad, consisting of the triphenylamine derivative-triazine-anthraquinone, is obtained to absorb triple photons of ∼510, ∼400, and ∼320 nm. We predict this new dyad will be a good candidate for use in solar cells. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

79959448650	Density functional theory (DFT) study on the dehydration of cellulose	Pyrolysis is a very important platform for the use of cellulose; however, the mechanism for the pyrolysis of cellulose is still not clear. A density functional theory (DFT) study was thus conducted to investigate the dehydration of cellulose using cellotriose as a model compound. The DFT study confirms that the location of hydroxyl groups has a significant influence on the dehydration of cellulose. The most active hydroxyl group is -O2H, followed by -O3H and -O6H. The pinacol rearrangement is a more likely mechanism for hydroxyl groups to be dehydrated. However, the barriers for dehydration are so high that dehydration reactions are difficult to occur. To obtain chemical products directly from the pyrolysis of cellulose, species with hydroxyl groups remaining might be targeted. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanism of cellulose pyrolysis, especially on the breaking of the glycosidic linkage and the opening of pyran rings. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

The results showed that the best source strain for preparing plasmids was the transformed host strain itself, and Escherichia coli JM110 as the source strain could yield significantly higher transformation efficiencies than Top10. The optimal recovery time of transformed ZM4 or CP4 cells to obtain maximum number of transformants and highest transformation efficiency was 11 h for pZB21-mini, pZB21 and pZA22, but 24 or 20 h for pBBR1MCS-2. The optimal electric field strength for pZB21-mini was 13.25 kV /cm in ZM4 and 14.0 kV /cm in CP4.But for pZA22 and pBBR1MCS-2, it was 11.75 kV /cm in ZM4 and 12.5 kV /cm in CP4; for pZB21, also 12.5 kV /cm in CP4.These plasmids were shown to be more stable in ZM4 than in CP4 by serial transfer to antibioticfree medium and the 3 plasmids were more stable than pBBR1MCS-2. The results will help to support the genetic and biotechnological research of Z. mobilis by providing information about some of the most important factors that influence the transformation of ZM4 and CP4, and also providing insights into the similarities and differences in their restriction-modification (R-M) systems. ©2011 Academic Journals.

The active layer was constructed by sequential spin-coating and self-assembly of chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA), respectively, on the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support layer. The spin-coating layer was denoted as inner layer, and the self-assembly layer was denoted as capping layer, and these two layers were compatible well without distinct boundary.

It was also observed that the separation factor of the HA/CS/PAN membranes with HA as capping layer was higher than that of the CS/HA/PAN membrane with CS as capping layer, but their fluxes were quite close.

84862605103	Preparation of polycarbonate grade bisphenol A by gas-stripping dephenolization	Due to many defects existing in the traditional dephenolization process, such as distillation, crystallization, and wiped film evaporation, it is necessary to study the new dephenolization process by using stripping steam to obtain polycarbonate grade bisphenol A (BPA) with ultra-lower free phenol mass fraction. In the new process, the raw material of crude BPA was obtained by falling-film evaporation with removal of most phenol. In view of BPA-phenol system with high boiling point, and heat-sensitivity, overheated steam was injected into the vacuum packed tower. The results show that the operating pressure of phenol stripping column, the temperature and the flowrate of stripping steam have great influences on the free phenol mass fraction in BPA product. The lower the pressure is, the higher the relative volatility is, and the better the dephenolization effect is; while too low pressure results in the increase of the equipment investment. The higher the temperature of stripping steam is, the higher the temperature of the materials in the tower is, thus the higher the saturated vapor pressure of phenol is and the better the dephenolization effect is. In the condition of constant operating pressure, the larger the flowrate of stripping steam is, the lower the partial pressure of phenol is, thus the better the dephenolization effect is. The suitable process parameters are as follows: the pressure is 4.0-5.0 kPa, the stripping steam temperature is 185-190°C, and the stripping steam flowrate is 2% of handling capacity.

However, co-fermentation efficiency was less than that of glucose fermentation. However, co-fermentation efficiency of xylose and glucose was less than that of glucose fermentation. Therefore, this study was carried out to investigate the influence of internal and external factors on co-fermentation. Three recombinant strains with different terminator of foreign genes were constructed, and they shared similar xylose fermentation performance. The effect of environmental conditions on co-fermentation was evaluated. The optimum conditions for co-fermentation of glucose and xylose were temperature 30∼34 °C and pH5.5. Ethanol productivity of co-fermentation in the pH range 4.5∼7.5 or temperature range 26∼40°C depended on efficiency of xylose metabolism. However, when the stirring speed was 50∼400 r/min, the ethanol productivity remained unchanged. The results comprehensively indicated the factors impacting ethanol production using recombinant Z mobilis. Hence, this investigation could provide a valuable clue for harnessing the biomass resource effectively.

It is widely used in plastic, organic synthesis, paint and pharmacy industry. Moreover, Butanol's Brit?ish thermal units (BTU) is almost equal to that of gasoline and higher than ethanol. Therefore, butanol has been recently identified as a good candidate of next-generation clean and renewable biofules to address the concerns for the availability of fossil feed stocks and climate change. Recent advances in the field of biotechnology have resulted in a renewed interest in the fermentation production of butanol (coproducts are acetone and ethanol) by using raw materials like starch, sugar and lignocelluloses. However, the traditional acetone butanol ethanol (ABE) fermentation process has many disadvantages such as high energy and material consumption and serious water pollution. For instance, the steam consumption is more than thirteen tons/per ton of solvent. In the past few years, our team has developed a series of new technologies to facilitate an effective and energy-efficient product removal in the traditional ABE fermentation process. The multi-effect thermal coupling technique was employed in the distillation unit which consumes the largest amount of energy in the entire process. With the heat integration and optimization, more than 35% energy was saved and the steam consumption was reduced to 6.5 tons/per ton of solvent while the product quality was also improved with the high-efficient distillation process. Based on the whole process modeling and optimization, both the heavy and light enrichment areas were identified for bleeding the impurities respectively. Accordingly, the total product yield was increased by 2% to reach 99%. In the meantime, the water flow was also optimized to minimize the water usage as well as the waste water. The production cost was greatly reduced in this improved ABE fermentation process. Currently, a 70,000 MTA bio-butanol plant has been built up using this technology.

Strains YC-AaEI and YC-TrEII showed the lowest enzyme activitiy (80.5 and 30.4 U/g DCW, respectively) and viscosity changes at 12 h (20.5 and 26.2% of the initial control viscosity, respectively), which were YCplac33-based and contained the Cwp2 sequence. The results showed that gene copy number was the most significant factor to influence the expression of endoglucanases in S. cerevisiae, and the existence of Cwp2 sequence led to decreased enzymatic level and viscosity-reducing performance, while it was shown not to realize efficient surface display of these two endoglucanases.

84867571444	Optimization of a synthetic medium for ethanol production by xylose-fermenting Zymomonas mobilis using response surface methodology	A synthetic medium for ethanol production by recombinant xylose-fermenting Zymomonas mobilis was optimized using Plackett-Burman (PB) design and response surface methodology (RSM). The effects of 19 medium components were investigated by PB design. Eight of these components were determined to have significant effects on ethanol production. The statistical model was constructed via central composite design (CCD) using five selected variables, including xylose, trisodium citrate, choline chloride, pyridoxine, and thiamine. The validity of the developed model was verified. The ethanol concentration in the optimized medium was 6. 7% higher than in the RM medium. The optimized medium was then simplified to give the final synthetic medium (S2), in which the ethanol concentration was 20. 7% higher than in the RM medium. Xylose and trisodium citrate were the key medium components influencing ethanol production, while calcium pantothenate was the only growth factor required by recombinant Z. mobilis. Ethanol production and growth response were directly proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of trisodium citrate in the range of 0. 1-1. 6 g/L. © 2012 The Author(s).

84867935687	Scanning assay of β-galactosidase activity	β-galactosidase, encoded by the lacZ gene in E. coli, can cleave lactose and structurally related compounds to galactose and glucose or structurally related products. Its activity can be measured using an artificial substrate, o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG). Miller firstly described the standard quantitative assay of β-galactosidase activity in the cells of bacterial cultures by disrupting the cell membrane with the permeabilization solution instead of preparing cell extracts. Therefore, β-galactosidase became one of the most widely used reporters of gene expression in molecular biology to reflect intracellular gene expression difference. But the Miller assay procedure could not monitor the β-galactosidase reaction in real time and its results were greatly influenced by some operations in the Miller procedure, such as permeabilization time, reaction time and concentration of the cell suspension. A scanning method based on the Miller method to determine the intracellular β-galactosidase activity in E. coli Tuner (DE3) expressing β-galactosidase in real time was developed and the permeabilization time of cells was optimized for that. The comparison of 3 assays of β-galactosidase activity (Miller, colorimetric and scanning) was made. The results proved that scanning method for the determination of enzyme activity with using ONPG as substrate is simple, fast and reproducible. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

84869889952	Distribution of aluminum and its influence on the acid strength of Y zeolite	A density functional theory (DFT) study has been conducted to investigate the distribution of Al atom in the framework of Y zeolite and thereby the relationship between siting position of Al atoms and the acid strength of zeolite. Structure properties of seven different Si/Al molar ratio of Y zeolite are calculated. The study shows that Al atoms are regularly distribution in the framework. And they are more easily distributed in the diagonal position of the four-ring. With the decreased Si/Al molar ratio, Al atoms are prior to distribute in the form of a trigonal symmetrical. From the whole distributions, Al atoms are trying to concentrate in the hemisphere of sodalite cage. The deprotonation energies of these seven cluster models are calculated to illustrate the change of Brönsted acid strength after the replacement. The result shows that the Brönsted acid strength is related to the Si/Al molar ratio of zeolite, as well as the distance between Al atoms. The substitution of Si located in the next-nearest-neighboring (NNN) of Al decreases the Brönsted acid strength of zeolite. As the Si/Al molar ratio decreases, the Brönsted acid strength decreased gradually. The difficulties of Al substitution are congruous with the change of Brönsted acid strength of A(1) site. The research on the relationship between Al siting place and Brönsted acid strength could provide theoretical information for the development of synthetic method to meet the specific requirement of Y zeolite catalysts, as well as the influence on the reaction process. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84871600017	Removal of acetic acid from fuel ethanol using ion-exchange resin	The amount of trace organic acids must be controlled in the fuel ethanol product in order to reduce the chance to corrode automotive cylinder. Ion-exchange resin was investigated to remove acids from fuel ethanol in this paper. Industrial resins, D301R, 330, 201×7, and D201, were selected as candidates, and a series of experiments were carried out to determine which one is the best. Acetic acid was employed as a simulated compound in these experiments for it is the main residual acid in fuel ethanol product. The results showed that the 330 resin was the most effective one to remove acid from fuel ethanol, and then, both static and dynamic experiments were carried out to evaluate the performance of the 330 resin. It was found that equilibrium data can be well described by Langmuir isotherm during the temperature range from 25 to 35 °C. The kinetic data fitted well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Furthermore, a bench scale fixed bed was set up to determine the optimal adsorption and regeneration conditions. When the initial concentration of acetic acid solution was 200 mg/L, the optimum operating conditions were as follows: A flux of 6.37 BV/h at a temperature of 30° C. The optimum regeneration conditions were determined as follows: A 4% solution of sodium hydroxide, flux was 3.18 BV/h, and the temperature was 30 °C. A refined product with acidity under 56 mg/L was obtained under optimal operating conditions. At last, industrial fuel ethanol was used to test the selected resin and the established process conditions. No obvious difference was observed after five adsorption and regeneration cycles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the ion-exchange method would be a successful industrial process to remove acids from fuel ethanol. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

In this study, an unmarked gfo mutant from Z. mobilis ZM4 was constructed using a site-specific FLP recombinase, and growth and ethanol production were evaluated with or without the addition of sorbitol to the media.

84872868625	CFD analysis of the effect of baffles on the fluid flow and heat transfer inside the shell of cross-flow fixed bed reactor	Tubular fixed bed reactors are used for highly exothermic reactions and are one of the most important reactor types in the chemical and petrochemical industries. Uniform condition of heat transfer between the tubes is the key to the reactor design. In the present work, the numerical method was used to investigate the effect of baffle structure on the heat transfer and pressure drop in the shell side of a cross-flow tubular fixed bed reactor. The flow and temperature fields inside the shell were resolved using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and a series of simulations were performed with a variable baffle number and baffle cut size, and the leakage between baffle and shell was also taken into consideration. The results were observed to be sensitive to the turbulence model. Six turbulence models were tried, and realizable k-ε model was proved as the best turbulence model by comparing the CFD results of heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop with empirical method results. The calculated outlet temperature, total pressure drop and average heat transfer coefficient of simulation and empirical methods were compared, and they were in a good agreement. The contours of velocity and temperature showed that there were obvious stagnation regions behind the baffles. The performance of heat transfer can be improved by increasing the number of baffle and decreasing the size of baffle cut, because these stagnation regions were eliminated, and the cross flow was better utilized. The simulation results also showed that the leakage between baffle and shell was beneficial to controlling the uniform distribution of temperature inside the shell. This leakage can reduce both pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient, but it can break the stagnation regions of the baffle back, which was useful to enhance the heat transfer and prevent local high temperature in those regions. However, the effect of clearance size between baffle and shell on heat transfer was needed to be studied in the future.

It showed good fermentation ability on both soluble sugar mixture and lignocellulose. Nearly all the glucose and xylose in sugar mixture can be consumed, corresponding to 86 % of theoretic ethanol yield. Simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) of NaOH-pretreated corncob was then carried out in a high dry matter (DM) loading of 15-25 w/v%. At the DM loading of 15 %, the suitable operating conditions were determined, i. e., Z. mobilis loading of 0. 30 g dry weight/L at 30 °C (pH 5. 5), under which the ethanol concentration reached 49. 2 g/L. Higher final ethanol concentrations were obtained when SSCF was operated at the fed-batch mode. Several amounts of substrate (1 % to 10 %) were added, and the highest final ethanol concentration (60. 5 g/L) was obtained at 10 % DM addition. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

The ensembles of noncontinous Pd atoms were found to be more energy-stable than continuous configurations on surfaces, and the second neighbor Pd pair was the most active sites for syn-thetizing vinyl acetate. The adsorption energy of CO on atop site and d band center of Pd in different ensembles were also investigated to research the synergistic effect between Pd and Au. The results showed that there was little electron transfer between Pd atoms and adjacent Au atoms on both surfaces and d band center and adsorption energy of CO decreased with the increasing number of Au atoms around Pd atoms in PdAu(111) surfaces, which didn't exist in PdAu(100) surfaces.

The effects of the methanol usage and oil flow rate on the FAME yield were investigated under the normal pressure and methanol boiling state. The oil flow rate had a significant effect on the FAME yield for the both reactors. The modified trickle bed reactor kept over 94.5% FAME yield under 0.6. mL/min oil flow rate and 91. mL catalyst bed volume, showing a much higher conversion and operational stability than the conventional type. With the modified trickle bed reactor, both transesterification and methanol separation could be performed simultaneously, and glycerin and methyl esters were separated additionally by gravity separation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84878752943	DFT study of the catalytic reactivity of Pd/Au(100) alloy surface for vinyl acetate synthesis from acetoxylation of ethylene	A density functional theory (DFT) study has been conducted to investigate the catalyst reactivity of Pd/Au(100) surface, which is well performed for the production of vinyl acetate (VAc) from acetoxylation of ethylene. The adsorption and co-adsorption properties of the key reagents as well as their coupling reaction were calculated and discussed. Ethylene species are weakly chemical-adsorbed on Pd/Au(100) with π- and 2σ- configuration; while acetate species are strongly chemical-absorbed on the surface with Pd-Au and Pd-Pd bi-dentate configurations. As the number of first-neighbor Pd atoms decreases, the molecular orbitals of the two reagents become closer due to the adsorption of the Pd/Au(100). The gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO-gap) becomes larger in the co-adsorption system, which implies that the electron transfer from HOMO to LUMO becomes more difficult. Energy barrier results of the elementary reaction are in good agreement with the previous molecular orbital analysis, demonstrating that more first-neighbor Pd atoms on Pd/Au(100) surface is not favor of the VAc synthesis.

The electronic effect induced by alloying with Au causes the Pd d-band to be more localized below the Fermi level. And it is the dominant factor that affects the chemisorption of ethylene. While the geometric effect plays an important role in the C. C bond weakening of the chemical-adsorbed ethylene and the chemisorption process of acetate species. Acetic acid is physically adsorbed on the different alloy configurations with similar structures. Adsorption energies and vibrational frequencies of the reagents are in good agreement with available experimental and theoretical results.

84883616217	Pervaporation dehydration of ethanol by hyaluronic acid/sodium alginate two-active-layer composite membranes	The composite membranes with two-active-layer (a capping layer and an inner layer) were prepared by sequential spin-coatings of hyaluronic acid (HA) and sodium alginate (NaAlg) on the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) support layer. The SEM showed a mutilayer structure and a distinct interface between the HA layer and the NaAlg layer. The coating sequence of two-active-layer had an obvious influence on the pervaporation dehydration performance of membranes. When the operation temperature was 80 C and water concentration in feed was 10 wt.%, the permeate fluxes of HA/Alg/PAN membrane and Alg/HA/PAN membrane were similar, whereas the separation factor were 1130 and 527, respectively. It was found that the capping layer with higher hydrophilicity and water retention capacity, and the inner layer with higher permselectivity could increase the separation performance of the composite membranes. Meanwhile, effects of operation temperature and water concentration in feed on pervaporation performance as well as membrane properties were studied. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The dehydrogenation barrier decreases from 1.15 eV on Cu(1 11) to 0.72 eV on Cu(1 1 0) and further to 0.67 eV on Cu(1 00). The presence of hydrogen bond decreases the barrier to 1.02 eVonCu(1 1 1)and 0.67 eVonCu(1 1 0), but increases the barrier to 0.75 eVonCu(100). Thus, the most effective catalyst surface is the clean Cu(1 00) and the ethanol adsorbed Cu(1 1 0).

The distribution properties of Ti in a zeolite are discussed by comparing substitution energies, they show that of the seventeen Si positions investigated the preferred substitution is the one where the Si atoms are located next to the Al, and that the Al is more easily replaced than Si. The framework of the Y zeolite shows a local expansion and deformation after the substitution. The deprotonation energy then reflects the change in Brönsted acidity, demonstrating that the replacement enhances the Brönsted acidity of the zeolite. Further, a detailed illustration of the relationship between the acidity of the zeolite and the location of the Ti is presented. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

The effect of CO on the catalytic performance of Pd-Au in the vinyl acetate system was also studied. Moreover, the method of reducing the content of CO in the industrial process and the reaction path of CO on the Pd-Au catalyst was investigated. Furthermore, the effect of CO on the acetoxylation of ethylene to vinyl acetate was reflected in two aspects. Firstly, the adsorption of CO on a Pd atom is more stable than that of ethylene, in which the adsorption of ethylene is blocked and the catalytic activity of the Pd-Au alloy decreases. Secondly, the Pd-Au alloy can catalyze the CO oxidation reaction. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

The expression of exogenous genes might be further improved through meiosis in an isogenic triploid. Here, a stable strain A-8 was screened from 35 sexual spore colonies obtained from an isogenic triploid integratively expressing bgl1 from Aspergillus aculeatus. The corresponding β-glucosidase activity in this strain was increased by ~120 % compared with the parent strain BGL-a. Measurement of doubling time, flow cytometry, and mating experiments further confirmed that A-8 was a spore-forming strain obtained from a triploid parent. Thus, combining δ-integration and meiosis in an isogenic triploid is a promising approach for improving the expression of exogenous proteins in S. cerevisiae. © 2014 The Author(s).

84919926850	Development of a cellulolytic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain with enhanced cellobiohydrolase activity	Consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is a promising technology for lignocellulosic ethanol production, and the key is the engineering of a microorganism that can efficiently utilize cellulose. Development of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for CBP requires high level expression of cellulases, particularly cellobiohydrolases (CBH). In this study, to construct a CBP-enabling yeast with enhanced CBH activity, three cassettes containing constitutively expressed CBH-encoding genes (cbh1 from Aspergillus aculeatus, cbh1 and cbh2 from Trichoderma reesei) were constructed. T. reesei eg2, A. aculeatus bgl1, and the three CBH-encoding genes were then sequentially integrated into the S. cerevisiae W303-1A chromosome via δ-sequence-mediated integration. The resultant strains W1, W2, and W3, expressing uni-, bi-, and trifunctional cellulases, respectively, exhibited corresponding cellulase activities. Furthermore, both the activities and glucose producing activity ascended. The growth test on cellulose containing plates indicated that CBH was a necessary component for successful utilization of crystalline cellulose. The three recombinant strains and the control strains W303-1A and AADY were evaluated in acid- and alkali-pretreated corncob containing media with 5 FPU exogenous cellulase/g biomass loading. The highest ethanol titer (g/l) within 7 days was 5.92 ± 0.51, 18.60 ± 0.81, 28.20 ± 0.84, 1.40 ± 0.12, and 2.12 ± 0.35, respectively. Compared with the control strains, W3 efficiently fermented pretreated corncob to ethanol. To our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at creating cellulolytic yeast with enhanced CBH activity by integrating three types of CBH-encoding gene with a strong constitutive promoter Ptpi.
