1642634039	New solution scheme for the member deletion problem in group signature by use of renew operator	A new solution scheme for the member deletion problem in Camenisch-Stadler's group signature schemes is proposed by use of the group member's secret property key renew operator. In the new scheme whenever a member joins or leaves the group, its manager computes a new group public property key and a group member's secret property key renew operator and then publishes them. Each group member modifies the secret property key by using the renew operator without the need to re-issue membership certificates. Hence the new scheme is an acceptable solution for a large group where its membership changes frequently. The group public key, member's secret key, and signature are all of constant size. The new scheme is better than Bresson-Stern's member deletion scheme because in Bresson-Stern's scheme the signature is dependent on the witness and the number of the witness is linear with respect to the number of the deletion members. The idea of the key renew operator is first used in the member deletion problem in Camenisch-Stadler's group signature schemes by Kim-Lim-Lee, but the scheme in this paper is more concise. The security of the scheme relies on the RSA assumption. The scheme is resistant to forging attack and forging a valid signature is equivalent to solving the RSA problem.

18244391961	Extended methodology of RS design and instances based on GIP	Abe et al. proposed the methodology of ring signature (RS) design in 2002 and showed how to construct RS with a mixture of public keys based on factorization and/or discrete logarithms. Their methodology cannot be applied to knowledge signatures (KS) using the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and cut-and-choose techniques, for instance, the Goldreich KS. This paper presents a more general construction of RS from various public keys if there exists a secure signature using such a public key and an efficient algorithm to forge the relation to be checked if the challenges in such a signature are known in advance. The paper shows how to construct RS based on the graph isomorphism problem (GIP). Although it is unknown whether or not GIP is NP-Complete, there are no known arguments that it can be solved even in the quantum computation model. Hence, the scheme has a better security basis and it is plausibly secure against quantum adversaries. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

24644514483	T-out-of-n string/bit oblivious transfers revisited	In this paper, we focus on lowering the complexity of t-out-of-n string/bit OTs for large t. The notion of oblivious public-key cryp-tosystem (OPKC) is introduced, in which Bob possesses n public keys but only t private keys and no one knows which t private keys Bob possesses. If the sender, say, Alice, encrypts each message using the n oblivious public keys, resp., the receiver, Bob, can obtain only t messages by t decryptions with his known t private keys. This approach can be directly applied to t-out-of-n bit OT. However, it is very inefficient due to heavy message expansion and many encryption/decryption operations. To construct t-out-of-n bit OT, we introduce bit oblivious public-key cryptosystem (BOPKC), which is a special public-key cryp-tosystem with a message space of n bits, and the private key only enables its owner to decrypt t bits of n secret bits. After an offline generation of such a BOPKC, it requires only one encryption, one decryption and one ciphertext. Finally, we show the concrete implementations of OPKC/BOPKC based on ElGamal/Paillier cryptosystem, and efficient t-out-of-n string/bit OTs are achieved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33645461077	Practical electronic auction with bids confidential	In most of the existing cryptographic auctions, the bidders' bids no longer remain confidential if the third parts collude. However, keeping the bids secret in any case is vital to the bidders because the bids are their true evaluations of the commodities and these evaluations may be their critical secrets. A Practical sealed electronic auction scheme of keeping bidders' bids confidential is proposed. No bid is revealed to anyone except the selling price even there exists serious collusion. Any one can verify that bidders follow the protocol to cast their bids and the winning price is correctly resolved according to opening rules. Also, the scheme is much more efficient than the recent publicly verifiable auctions by Brandt. In its typical implementation, the scheme requires at most O(log

33750064829	Zero-knowledge proof of generalized compact Knapsacks (or a novel identification/signature scheme)	At FOCS 2002, a new generalized compact Knapsacks problem is introduced. It is shown that solving the generalized compact Knapsack problem on the average is at least as hard as the worst-case instance of various approximation problems over cyclic lattices. It is left as an open problem to construct a zero-knowledge proof of generalized compact Knapsack problem. In this paper, by investigating a new notion of one-way ensemble pair, we propose a generic construction of identification and achieve a signature with the Fiat-Shamir transformation. Following our generic construction, we implement a concrete scheme based on the random generalized compact Knapsack problem. Our scheme also implies the first efficient zero-knowledge proof of the generalized compact Knapsacks problem and results in a positive solution to the open problem at FOCS 2002. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

33749495250	A key agreement scheme for mobile Ad Hoc networks based on password authentication	As a new type of wireless mobile networks, Ad Hoc networks do not depend on any fixed infrastructure, and have no centralized control unit and so its computation capabilities are limited by mobile nodes. In this paper, a novel multi-party key agreement scheme with password authentication and sharing password evolvement for Ad Hoc networks is proposed based on ECC (elliptic curves cryptography). One of the functions of passwords is used as sharing information to authenticate the mobile node's secret keys, and the other is used as a symmetrical key to encrypt alternating information between mobile nodes. The freshness and security of passwords are guaranteed by sharing password evolvement every time in mobile node's secret keys authentication and key agreement. Consequently, the computational overheads and the store load of mobile nodes are lessened, moreover, secret keys authentication and information encryption between mobile nodes are provided. The new scheme enjoys many secure properties such as against man-in-the-middle attack, against replay attack, key independence, forward security, etc.

3442894548	Zero-knowledge proof scheme of possessing a DSA digital signature	Based on the ideas of undeniable digital signature and confirmer digital signature, a new zero-knowledge proof scheme of possessing a DSA digital signature is proposed which can be used to prevent the arbitrary distribution of digital signature. In the scheme the prover has not to give directly the DSA signature of a message, but to give a zero-knowledge proof of possessing a DSA digital signature of the message. The scheme not only expands the function of undeniable digital signature by verifying a signature without exposing any knowledge, but also improves confirmer digital signature due to its much more simplicity than the latter in practice and the significant feature is that it does not need the participation of the third party. The scheme is proven to be secure under the assumption that Hash function is secure under the random oracle model and the intractability of discrete logarithm problems.

34648825634	New ID-based universal designated-verifier signature scheme	Designated verifier Signature schemes can be used to realize a new destination that a signer can choose a desired verifier to verify the availability of the signatures, which can prevent the abuse of spreading the signature. A new ID-based universal designated-verifier signature (ID-UDVS) scheme is proposed from bilinear pairings. The proposed scheme introduces two independent PKG to solve the hidden secure trouble that exists in existing ID-based universal designated-verifier signature scheme to a certain extent, in which the single PKG can impersonate the signers to forge their signatures. We also prove that our ID-UDVS scheme is secure in the sense of our unforgeability and privacy notions for ID-UDVS schemes, under the GDH assumption and the random-oracle model.

35448984463	A novel short signature without random oracles	We present a new short signature provably secure under the standard model. The proposed signature is equipped with attractive properties: (1) The signature can be generated without learning the message content; (2) The signature can be re-randomized and the resulting signature has the same distribution as the original one; (3) Without knowledge of the original signature and even the message content, one can be convinced that a signature holder has obtained the correct signature from the signer. We note that these properties are useful to construct many cryptographic protocols such as pseudonym systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first short signature scheme that is equipped with these properties. Our signature is proven to be Existentially unforgeable under a Chosen message attack (EUF-CMA) in the standard definition without using random oracles. The signature length is as short as the state-of-the-art Boneh-Boyen short signature.

The security proofs are provided in the Universally Composable model, which allows the proofs of security valid not only when our scheme is executed in isolation, but also in composition with other secure cryptographic primitives. We also present several new computational assumptions and justify them in the generic group model. These assumptions are useful in the design of high-level protocols and may be of independent interest. © 2007 Science Press, Beijing, China and Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, USA.

In Crypto 2005, Boneh, Gentry and Waters (BGW) proposed two efficient broadcast encryption schemes proven secure in their security definition. They also suggested for a number of applications of their schemes including satellite TV subscription services and DVD content protections. In contrast to this suggestion, we show that any legitimate decoder(s) can collude with the revoked decoders to produce exponentially many equivalent decryption keys, and moreover, this activity cannot be traced by the dealer. Our results remind of abuse that their schemes are not suitable for the satellite TV subscription services or DVD content protection applications, although their schemes may be applicable in trusted environments such as conference key distribution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

The improved encryption scheme can encrypt |n|+k bit messages with higher efficiency. Security and efficiency analysis of the improved encryption scheme were also provided, and the security of the improved scheme is equivalent to that of the original encryption scheme, the higher residuosity problem and quadratic residuosity problem modulo n. Compared to the original Paillier-Pointcheval encryption scheme, the improved encryption scheme has features of higher efficiency, lower traffic date and larger size of plaintexts.

34248665610	Multi-projector display wall system for windows desktop applications	Large-format high-resolution display systems are increasingly adopted in virtual reality, digital museum, scientific visualization, and other application fields. Traditionally, wall size display system is driven by a cluster of PCs or special high end graphics supercomputer. With the rapid advance of PC graphics hardware, one inexpensive mainstream PC has the power to drive multiple high-resolution displays. This paper proposes one multi-projector display wall system driven by single PC. Besides graphics intensive applications, this system can transparently and efficiently display windows desktop applications without modifying the source code. It takes advantage of the bandwidth of PCI Express bus, and supports at least triple projectors, which is suitable for constructing immersive virtual reality center. Design geometric alignment and photometric correction methods are given to display the frame buffer content seamlessly on the planar display screen. Experimental results show that this system can achieve real time refresh rates. It does little side effect on the performance of common non-graphics windows desktop applications.

84867139334	Planning parameters and household carbon emission: Evidence from high- and low-carbon neighborhoods in Beijing	This paper contributes to the study of planning for low-carbon cities by providing empirical evidence on the relationship between planning parameters (i.e., density, land use mix, accessibility to public transportation and jobs-housing balance) and household carbon emission in Beijing, China. Five neighborhoods representing different levels of carbon emission are selected using a household survey dataset that includes 1227 sample households; these neighborhoods are analyzed using the survey dataset together with land use data provided by the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning Commission. Findings confirm that higher population density, mixed land-use patterns, better accessibility to public transportation, and job-housing balance are important planning parameters that reduce household carbon emission in Beijing. This research provides the first empirical evidence from a large Asian city that can assist planners and policy makers in estimating the impact that planning principles can have on reducing household carbon emission. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system that the privacy of users is guaranteed in software registration. Our system enjoys a modular design and can be implemented by any secure ID-based partially blind signature scheme. Furthermore, the proposal allows flexible registration information definition.

62749120258	The spatial distribution of producer services in Shanghai	This paper examines the location characteristics of the newly emerged producer services in Shanghai. The research questions are: how does the location of producer services fit into Shanghai's spatial context? What are the factors shaping the spatial distribution pattern? Are the spatial distribution and its determinants similar to those observed in other cities? Analyses of data collected from field reconnaissance, interviews and secondary sources reveal that the spatial distribution of producer services in Shanghai is characterised by concentration and dispersion. The concentration of producer services in an extensive central-city core is similar to that observed in other cities. However, the wide spread of producer services over a fairly big region is unexpected. The paper adds insight to the study of producer services by contending that contextual factors such as an indigenous path of development, state intervention and market institution, determine the location of producer services in Shanghai. © 2009 Urban Studies Journal Limited.

67650112871	Privacy for private key in signatures	One of the important applications of digital signature is anonymous credential or pseudonym system. In these scenarios, it is essential that the identity of the signer is kept secret from any third party, except the trusted authority. The identity in such a system is uniquely identified by the secret key (or the signing key) rather than the public key, since the public key may be repeatedly randomized. This paper formalizes this notion by investigating a new property of digital signatures, called key indistinguishability. In this notion, given a number of digital signatures generated from two known public keys, an adversary cannot determine whether the signing keys used to generate these public keys, and hence the signatures, are the same. This property ensures that the signatures do not leak any information of the signing keys. Observing that existing digital signatures without random oracles do not provide such a property, we fill the gap with the first key indistinguishable signature scheme which is existentially unforgeable under a chosen message attack without using random oracles. The proposed scheme is also efficient and practical for applications in pseudonym systems.

67650159583	Publicly verifiable privacy-preserving group decryption	Anonymity is one of the main concerns in group-oriented cryptography. However, most efforts, for instance, group signatures and ring signatures, are only made to provide anonymity on the sendeŕs side. There are merely few works done to ensure anonymity in a cryptographic sense on the recipient́s side in group-oriented communications. This paper formalizes the notion of group decryption (GD). It can be viewed as an analog of group signatures in the context of public key encryptions. In this notion, a sender can encrypt a committed message intended to any member of a group, managed by a group manager, while the recipient of the ciphertext remains anonymous. The sender can convince a verifier about this fact without leaking the plaintext or the identity of the recipient. If required, the group manager can verifiably open the identity of the recipient. We propose an efficient GD scheme that is proven secure in the random oracle model. The overhead in both computation and communication is independent of the group size. A full ciphertext is about 0.2K bytes in a typical implementation and the scheme is practical.

This concept not only enables confidential communications among group users but also permits any outsider to send encrypted messages to the group. The existing instantiation is only secure against passive adversaries. In this paper, we first propose an authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol which captures the practical security properties against active attacks. Based on our protocol, we then propose a broadcast encryption system without relying on a trusted dealer to distribute the secret keys to the users. Our system has also short ciphertexts. Furthermore, the proposal is equipped with the perfect forward security property. ©2010 IEEE.

The direct derivation of public keys in identity-based public-key cryptography eliminates the need for certificates and solves certain public key management problems in traditional public-key cryptosystems. Recently, the notion of asymmetric group key agreement was introduced, in which the group members merely negotiate a common encryption key which is accessible to any entity, but they hold respective secret decryption keys. In this paper, we first propose a security model for identity-based authenticated asymmetric group key agreement (IB-AAGKA) protocols. We then propose an IB-AAGKA protocol which is proven secure under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

77956235295	Efficient many-to-one authentication with certificateless aggregate signatures	Aggregate signatures allow an efficient algorithm to aggregate n signatures of n distinct messages from n different users into one single signature. The resulting aggregate signature can convince a verifier that the n users did indeed sign the n messages. This feature is very attractive for authentications in bandwidth-limited applications such as reverse multicasts and senor networks. Certificateless public key cryptography enables a similar functionality of public key infrastructure (PKI) and identity (ID) based cryptography without suffering from complicated certificate management in PKI or secret key escrow problem in ID-based cryptography. In this paper, we present a new efficient certificateless aggregate signature scheme which has the advantages of both aggregate signatures and certificateless cryptography. The scheme is proven existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our scheme is also very efficient in both communication and computation and the proposal is practical for many-to-one authentication. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We implement a concrete AHBE scheme proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption. The resulting scheme has sub-linear complexity, comparable to up-to-date broadcast systems which have also sub-linear complexity but require a fully trusted dealer.

78650446248	A three-phase approach to photometric calibration for multi-projector display using LCD projectors	Photometric calibration plays important role when building seamless appearance of multi-projector display. In this paper, we address photometric issues on chrominance variation and luminance nonuniformity in multi-display system constructed using LCD projectors. A three-phase approach is proposed to construct imaging models, which makes transformations among them when formulating the whole imaging procedure. These models are named as single-projector model, normalized-projector model and display-wall model. Single-projector model describes the imaging procedure from the projector's input color to its measured tristimulus values in CIEXYZ. Normalized-projector model denotes the common gamut of projectors, which normalizes each single-projector model, and makes every projector have the same ranges of chrominance and luminance. The display-wall model treats the whole display as one projector, which has similar photometric model to single LCD projector. Weighting light contributions from all projectors using the display wall model, our method can achieve visually plausible seamlessness. © Springer-Verlag 2010.

78650727109	Secure compression of privacy-preserving witnesses in vehicular ad hoc networks	Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are designed to improve traffic safety and efficiency. To this end, the traffic communication must be authenticated to guarantee trustworthiness for guiding drivers and establishing liability in case of traffic accident investigation. Cryptographic authentication techniques have been extensively exploited to secure VANETs. Applying cryptographic authentication techniques such as digital signatures raises challenges to efficiently store signatures on messages growing with time. To alleviate the conflict between traffic liability investigation and limited storage capacity in vehicles, this paper proposes to aggregate signatures in VANETs. Our proposal can preserve privacy for honest vehicles and trace misbehaving ones, and provides a practical balance between security and privacy in VANETs. With our proposal, cryptographic witnesses of safety-related traffic messages can be significantly compressed so that they can be stored for a long period for liability investigation. Our proposal allows a large number of traffic messages to be verified as if they were a single one, which speeds up the response of vehicles to traffic reports. © 2010 IEEE.

78650855071	Threshold public-key encryption with adaptive security and short ciphertexts	Threshold public-key encryption (TPKE) allows a set of users to decrypt a ciphertext if a given threshold of authorized users cooperate. Existing TPKE schemes suffer from either long ciphertexts with size linear in the number of authorized users or can only achieve non-adaptive security. A non-adaptive attacker is assumed to disclose her target attacking set of users even before the system parameters are published. The notion of non-adaptive security is too weak to capture the capacity of the attackers in the real world. In this paper, we bridge these gaps by proposing an efficient TPKE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts and adaptive security. Security is proven under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. This implies that our proposal preserves security even if the attacker adaptively corrupts all the users outside the authorized set and some users in the authorized set, provided that the number of corrupted users in the authorized set is less than a threshold. We also propose an efficient tradeoff between the key size and the ciphertext size, which gives the first TPKE scheme with adaptive security and sublinear-size public key, decryption keys and ciphertext. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

Furthermore, we propose an HCLS scheme which, under the hardness of the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem, is proven to be existentially unforgeable against adaptive chosen-message attacks in the random oracle model. As to efficiency, our scheme has constant complexity, regardless of the depth of the hierarchy. Hence, the proposal is secure and scalable for practical applications. © 2010 IEEE.

80053138624	Fully distributed broadcast encryption	Broadcast encryption schemes rely on a centralized authority to generate decryption keys for each user. It is observed that, when a broadcast encryption scheme is deployed for secret escrows, a dishonest dealer can read the escrowed secrets without leaving any witnesses. We present a new broadcast encryption paradigm referred to as fully distributed broadcast encryption (FDBE) without suffering from this vulnerability. In the new paradigm, there are multiple dealers, and by contacting a number of them equal to a threshold or more, any user can join the system; then the secrets can be encrypted to any subset of users and only the intended receivers can decrypt, while an attacker cannot get any information about the encrypted message even if the attacker controls all the users outside the receiver set and corrupts some dealers, provided that the number of corrupted dealers is less than a threshold. We realize the first fully distributed broadcast encryption scheme which is proven secure under the decision Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation assumption in the standard model. A variant is also shown to achieve sub-linear complexity in terms of public key, decryption key and ciphertext, comparable to up-to-date regular broadcast encryption schemes without robustness and strong security against misbehaving dealers. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80054828476	APPA: Aggregate privacy-preserving authentication in vehicular ad hoc networks	Most security- and privacy-preserving protocols in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) heavily rely on time-consuming cryptographic operations which produce a huge volume of cryptographic data. These data are usually employed for many kinds of decisions, which poses the challenge of processing the received cryptographic data fast enough to avoid unaffordable reaction delay. To meet that challenge, we propose a vehicular authentication protocol referred to as APPA. It guarantees trustworthiness of vehicular communications and privacy of vehicles, and enables vehicles to react to vehicular reports containing cryptographic data within a very short delay. Moreover, using our protocol, the seemingly random cryptographic data can be securely and substantially compressed so that the storage space of a vehicle can be greatly saved. Finally, our protocol does not heavily rely on roadside units (RSUs) and it can work to some extent even if the VANET infrastructure is incomplete. These features distinguish our proposal from others and make it attractive in various secure VANET scenarios. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

81055123806	Preserving security and privacy in large-scale VANETs	Upcoming vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) allowing vehicles to talk to each other are expected to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation systems. This type of networks is especially attractive in highly populated urban areas overwhelmed with traffic congestions and accidents. Besides vulnerabilities versus attacks against traffic safety and driver privacy, a large-scale VANET in a metropolitan area raises scalability and management challenges. This paper employs identity-based group signatures (IBGS) to divide a large-scale VANET into easy-to-manage groups and establish liability in vehicular communications while preserving privacy. Each party's human-recognizable identity is used as its public key and no additional certificate is required. This efficiently avoids the complicated certificate management of existing protocols. We further investigate selfish verification approach to accelerate message processing in VANETs. With this approach, a vehicle selects only the messages affecting its driving decisions and validates the selected messages as if they were a single one. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

82955184558	Bridging broadcast encryption and Group key agreement	Broadcast encryption (BE) schemes allow a sender to securely broadcast to any subset of members but requires a trusted party to distribute decryption keys. Group key agreement (GKA) protocols enable a group of members to negotiate a common encryption key via open networks so that only the members can decrypt the ciphertexts encrypted under the shared encryption key, but a sender cannot exclude any particular member from decrypting the ciphertexts. In this paper, we bridge these two notions with a hybrid primitive referred to as contributory broadcast encryption (CBE). In this new primitive, a group of members negotiate a common public encryption key while each member holds a decryption key. A sender seeing the public group encryption key can limit the decryption to a subset of members of his choice. Following this model, we propose a CBE scheme with short ciphertexts. The scheme is proven to be fully collusion-resistant under the decision n-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation (BDHE) assumption in the standard model. We also illustrate a variant in which the communication and computation complexity is sub-linear with the group size. Of independent interest, we present a new BE scheme that is aggregatable. The aggregatability property is shown to be useful to construct advanced protocols. © 2011 International Association for Cryptologic Research.

To this end, VANETs should be designed to be resistant against various abuses and attacks. In this paper, we first review the existing proposals to provide security, privacy, and data aggregation in vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We then address the fundamental issue of achieving these conflicting properties in a unified solution, having observed that separate efforts cannot fulfill the VANET design objectives. A set of new mechanisms are suggested for efficiently managing identities and securely compressing cryptographic witnesses, which are among the major obstacles to the deployment of strong security mechanisms in VANETs. © 2011 IEEE.

They also formally showed that every receiver in the proposed scheme is anonymous to any other receiver. In this work, the authors study the security of Fan et al.'s anonymous multi-receiver identity-based encryption scheme. It is regretful that they found their scheme is insecure. Every receiver in Fan et al.'s scheme is not anonymous to any other receiver. The authors showed that simple protocol changes can fix these weaknesses and render Fan et al.'s scheme. The improved scheme is proved to satisfy the confidentiality and receiver anonymity in the random oracle. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84863564136	Cryptanalysis and improvements of some ring signature and its extended signature schemes	The security flaws of the ring signature and its extended signature schemes proposed by Zhang (2007), Li-Chen-Yuen-Wang (2006), Li-Wang (2006) and Zhu-Zhang-Wang (2009) are analyzed. It points out that these schemes can not resist the group-changing attack or anonymity attack. The attack methods are presented based on their security flaws. In order to avoid these flaws, we make use of the generic construction method and the corresponding forking lemma of ring signature scheme from Herranz-Saez (2003) to improve the original signature schemes. The improved signature schemes are provably secure.

84864410180	The location dynamics of firms in transitional Shanghai, 1978-2005	China's economic reform started in 1978 has brought in profound changes to firms by transforming the state-owned-enterprises and by encouraging the growth of the non-state sector business. These changes have been accompanied by broader institutional changes and economic restructuring in the cities, especially in the larger ones. This paper focuses on the changing spatial distribution patterns and the underlying location factors of firms in different sectors within Shanghai, one of China's largest and most dynamic cities. The central research question is raised as do the rapidly changing spatial patterns of corporate activities within Shanghai since the onset of China's economic reform reflect the influence of market forces? Data were collected from Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce. Both GIS mapping and statistics (i.e. Moran's Index, density gradient) were used to assess the spatial distribution pattern of firms in Shanghai. An empirical model derived from neo-classical location theory is employed to examine the location factors of firms in different sectors. Findings of the paper indicate that the spatial distribution and location factors of firms in Shanghai demonstrate the city's unique urban restructuring process, which is closely related to the city's specific economic stage and unique "transitional" characteristics. However, market forces do play an increasingly import role in firm's location-choice behavior in Shanghai. This study contributes to the understanding of firm location dynamics in postsocialist cities.

84868149532	Analysis and improvements of two identity based anonymous signcryption schemes for multiple receivers	Anonymous signcryption provides anonymity of the sender with the advantages of signcryption. When a sender wants to send a message to multiple receivers in the confidential and authenticated way, multi receiver signcryption is needed. In 2010, Zhang et al. proposed an identity based anonymous signcryption scheme for multiple receivers which is proved secure in the standard model. At the same time, Lal et al. designed another identity based anonymous signcryption scheme for multiple receivers in the random oracle model. Unfortunately, we show that the two schemes do not satisfy the semantic security. Then we improve their corresponding anonymous signcryption schemes that remedy the weaknesses of the above two schemes. Our proposed schemes satisfy the semantic security, unforgeability, signcrypter identity's ambiguity, and public authenticity. © 2012 IEEE.

84868274005	Robust distributed privacy-preserving secure aggregation in vehicular communication	Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), formed by computers embedded in vehicles and the traffic infrastructure, are expected to develop in the near future to improve traffic safety and efficiency. To this end, VANETs should be designed to be resistant against various abuses and attacks. In this paper, we first review the existing proposals to provide security, privacy, and data aggregation in vehicle-to-vehicle communication. We then address the fundamental issue of achieving these conflicting properties in a unified solution, having observed that separate efforts cannot fulfill the VANET design objectives. A set of new mechanisms are suggested for efficiently managing identities and securely compressing cryptographic witnesses, which are among the major obstacles to the deployment of strong security mechanisms in VANETs. Finally, we employ the standard threshold cryptographic technology to improve the basic protocol with robustness.

84870654010	An improved binary authentication tree algorithm for vehicular networks	Vehicular networks are gaining popularity because vehicular communications are able to help minimize accidents, improve traffic conditions, etc. To avoid malicious attacks and potential abuse, employing digital signatures is widely recognized as the most efficient approach for vehicular networks. However, when the number of signatures received by a roadside unit (RSU) becomes large, a scalability problem emerges immediately: it can be difficult for the RSU to sequentially verify every received signature within 100-300ms as required by the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) broadcast protocol. Jiang et al. proposed a robust and efficient signature scheme for vehicular-to- infrastructure communications, called binary authentication tree. In this paper, we show that their binary authentication algorithm is insecure to at least two attacks. The first attack shows that the original binary authentication algorithm is universally forgeable under chosen-message attacks, i.e., the attacker can forge other vehicles' authentication on any message under chosen-message attack. The second attack shows that the original binary authentication algorithm is universally forgeable, i.e., the attacker can forge other vehicles' authentication on any message at will. Although Jiang et al.'s scheme is insecure, it can be repaired. Using the binary authentication tree model, we repair their scheme in order to make it provably secure and efficient. © 2012 IEEE.

84870679542	A new identity based signcryption scheme in the standard model	Signcryption is a useful cryptographic primitive which simultaneously performs encryption and signature with cost less than the signature-then- encryption approach. Identity-based signcryption (IBSC) eliminates the complicated management of certificates in signcryption schemes in the traditional public-key infrastructure (PKI) setting. Most IBSC schemes are constructed in the random oracle model, while it is unknown how to instantiate a really ''random" oracle in the real world. By exploiting Boneh et al.'s strongly unforgeable signature and Paterson et al.'s identity-based signature, this paper proposes a new IBSC scheme in the standard model. It is proven that our IBSC scheme satisfies semantic security and strong unforgeability under the bilinear decision Diffie-Hellman (BDDH) assumption. The proofs do not rely on random oracles. Performance analysis shows that our scheme is also efficient and practical. © 2012 IEEE.

84876400802	Fast transmission to remote cooperative groups: A new key management paradigm	The problem of efficiently and securely broadcasting to a remote cooperative group occurs in many newly emerging networks. A major challenge in devising such systems is to overcome the obstacles of the potentially limited communication from the group to the sender, the unavailability of a fully trusted key generation center, and the dynamics of the sender. The existing key management paradigms cannot deal with these challenges effectively. In this paper, we circumvent these obstacles and close this gap by proposing a novel key management paradigm. The new paradigm is a hybrid of traditional broadcast encryption and group key agreement. In such a system, each member maintains a single public/secret key pair. Upon seeing the public keys of the members, a remote sender can securely broadcast to any intended subgroup chosen in an ad hoc way. Following this model, we instantiate a scheme that is proven secure in the standard model. Even if all the nonintended members collude, they cannot extract any useful information from the transmitted messages. After the public group encryption key is extracted, both the computation overhead and the communication cost are independent of the group size. Furthermore, our scheme facilitates simple yet efficient member deletion/addition and flexible rekeying strategies. Its strong security against collusion, its constant overhead, and its implementation friendliness without relying on a fully trusted authority render our protocol a very promising solution to many applications. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

84878354791	Improved one-to-many authentication scheme for access control in pay-TV systems	Mutual authentication is important in a mobile pay-TV system. Traditional authentication schemes make use of one-to-one delivery, that is, one authentication message per request is delivered from a head-end system to subscriber. This delivery occupies too much bandwidth and therefore is inefficient and costly. One-to-many authentication scheme for access control in mobile pay-TV systems was proposed by Sun et al. in 2009. In one-to-many authentication scheme, only one authentication message for multiple requests is broadcasted from the head-end system (HES) to subscribers. Sun et al. claimed that their scheme is secure and provides anonymous authentication for protecting user privacy. However, the authors demonstrate that their scheme has a critical weakness. An attacker without any secret information can not only successfully impersonate mobile set (MS) to cheat the HES but also impersonate HES to cheat MS. The authors result is important for security engineers who design and develop user authentication systems. Afterwards, the authors design a novel one-to-many authentication scheme from bilinear pairings. They give the formal security proof in the random oracle model. In addition, they present the performance analysis of our scheme. The analysis results showed that their novel authentication scheme has shorter transmission message and can be applied in the environment which has limited bandwidth. At the same time, their scheme is also the first secure one-to-many authentication scheme for access control in pay-TV systems. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.

84879834299	Emerging Polycentricity in Beijing: Evidence from Housing Price Variations, 2001-05	This paper examines the emerging multiple centre urban spatial structure in Beijing using housing price variation as an indicator. A random sample of 3783 apartment units was used. These apartments were recent sales in 2001, 2003 and 2005. The dataset included transaction prices and main housing attributes gathered from the Beijing Construction Committee. A hedonic price model was calibrated to investigate the importance of the different urban centres to housing price variations. The results show that multiple urban centres (such as Tian'anmen, CBD, Zhongguancun and the Olympic Centre) explain more of the variations in housing price differences in the metropolitan space than any centre does alone. The findings also reveal changes in impacts from the individual centres in the study period. These outcomes confirm that Beijing is moving towards a polycentric urban form. The emerging multiple urban centres are key factors in understanding the spatial restructuring of Beijing, especially in modelling its emerging housing market. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.

84880293050	Identity-based optimistic fair exchange in the standard model	A fair exchange protocol allows two entities to exchange digital signatures over open networks in a fair way, so that either each entity obtains the other's signature or neither entity does. Fair exchange protocol plays an important role in electronic commerce in the case of exchanging digital contracts. In this paper, we propose a fair exchange protocol based on identity-based verifiably encrypted signatures. Our protocol involves an offline trusted third party which is only required when one entity attempts to cheat or crashes. The underlining identity-based verifiably encrypted signature scheme is proven secure under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption and is the first identity-based verifiably encrypted signature scheme provably secure against existential unforgeable under adaptive chosen message and identity attacks in the standard model.

84881047645	A generic construction of proxy signatures from certificateless signatures	The primitive of proxy signatures allows the original signer to delegate proxy signers to sign on messages on behalf of the original signer. It has found numerous applications in distributed computing scenarios where delegation of signing rights is common. Certificateless public key cryptography eliminates the complicated certificates in traditional public key cryptosystems without suffering from the key escrow problem in identity-based public key cryptography. In this paper, we reveal the relationship between the two important primitives of proxy signatures and certificateless signatures and present a generic conversion from the latter to the former. Following the generic transformation, we propose an efficient proxy signature scheme with a recent certificateless signature scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

84890033565	Finding key leakage in hierarchical distribution of encrypted data	In distribution of data encrypted to multiple users, there is a problem that the system will become low efficient if a single key center has to generate keys for a large number of users. Besides, it is a risk that some users could deliberately disclose their keys for some benefits. We in this paper give a key leakage discovering scheme where users are partitioned into groups and groups are hierarchically organized. In our scheme, users in upper-level groups can delegate keys for users in lower-level groups, which alleviates the key generation burden of the trusted third party. As an interesting feature, our scheme provide a key leakage discovering measure that if some users in groups leaked their decryption keys then at least one of them can be found out. This enables the data owners to accuse the illegal users when they infringed the copyright. At last, we analyze the performance of our system. © 2013 IEEE.

84888840097	Simultaneous authentication and secrecy in identity-based data upload to cloud	Most existing works to secure cloud devote to remote integrity check, search and computing on encrypted data. In this paper, we deal with simultaneous authentication and secrecy when data are uploaded to cloud. Observing that cloud is most interesting to companies in which multiple authorized employees are allowed to upload data, we propose a general framework for secure data upload in an identity-based setting. We present and employ identity-based signcryption (IBSC) to meet this goal. As it is shown that it is challenging to construct IBSC scheme in the standard model and most IBSC schemes are realized in the random oracle model which is regarded weak to capture the realistic adversaries, we propose a new IBSC scheme simultaneously performing encryption and signature with cost less than the signature-then-encryption approach. The identity based feature eliminates the complicated certificates management in signcryption schemes in the traditional public-key infrastructure (PKI) setting. Our IBSC scheme exploits Boneh et al.'s strongly unforgeable signature and Paterson et al.'s identity-based signature. The scheme is shown to satisfy semantic security and strong unforgeability. The security relies on the well-defined bilinear decision Diffie-Hellman (BDDH) assumption and the proof is given in the standard model. With our IBSC proposal, a secure data upload scheme is instantiated with simultaneous authentication and secrecy in a multi-user setting. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84894562939	Identity-based remote data possession checking in public clouds	Checking remote data possession is of crucial importance in public cloud storage. It enables the users to check whether their outsourced data have been kept intact without downloading the original data. The existing remote data possession checking (RDPC) protocols have been designed in the PKI (public key infrastructure) setting. The cloud server has to validate the users' certificates bef ore storing the data uploaded by the users in order to prevent spam. This incurs considerable costs since numerous users may frequently upload data to the cloud server. This study addresses this problem with a new model of identity-based RDPC (ID-RDPC) protocols. The authors present the first ID-RDPC protocol proven to be secure assuming the hardness of the standard computational Diffie-Hellman problem. In addition to the structural advantage of elimination of certificate management and verification, the authors ID-RDPC protocol also outperforms the existing RDPC protocols in the PKI setting in terms of computation and communication. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.

84896514596	Housing price bubbles and inter-provincial spillover: Evidence from China	The soaring housing prices in many provinces of China have recently attracted increasing attention. This study addresses the questions of whether there are housing price bubbles in the provinces and whether the bubbles are spatially contagious. We adopt a unit root, cointegration test that uses structural changes and loan-to-income ratios to test housing rational bubbles and a vector error correction model (VECM), the Impulse Response Function, and Granger causality to investigate potential contagion and spillover effects from core to peripheral provinces. Housing price data from 28 provinces in China, ranging from the first quarter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2012, are analyzed. First, it is found that most of the provinces do have bubbles and affordability problems. Second, housing prices in provinces that were within the same potentially contagious region were cointegrated together. Third, spillover effects existed in contagious regions around Beijing and Shanghai, where each province has severe bubbles and affordability problems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84899001741	Experimental performance comparisons between (H)IBE schemes over composite-order and prime-order bilinear groups	The Boneh-Boyen Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) and the Boneh-Boyen-Goh Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) are elegant schemes built over prime-order bilinear groups. These two schemes are only proven secure under selective security model. For purpose of fully and efficient (H)IBE schemes, Lewko and Waters provided a practical technique, called Dual System, to transform these two schemes proven to be fully secure. Their key technique is to implement these schemes in composite-order bilinear groups equipped with orthogonality. Performance comparisons between these schemes is valuable to guide engineering implementations in practice. In this paper, we provide benchmarks on basic operations in composite-order and prime-order bilinear groups, both at a 256-bit security level. Then, we present software implementations and efficiency comparisons for Boneh-Boyen IBE, Boneh-Boyen-Goh HIBE schemes and their fully-secure variations by Lewko and Waters. The experimental results show much better efficiency of prime-order bilinear groups and advocate the use of prime-order groups when efficiency is strongly required. © 2014 IEEE.

84899471806	Signatures in hierarchical certificateless cryptography: Efficient constructions and provable security	Many efforts have been devoted in recent years to constructing secure schemes in certificateless cryptography. The aim is to eliminate the key escrow problem of identity-based cryptography. However, most of the work takes place in traditional certificateless cryptography, which suffers from the single-point problem. Hierarchical cryptography exploits a practical security model to mirror the organizational hierarchy in the real world and hence can eliminate the single-point problem. To incorporate the advantages of both types of cryptosystems, in this paper we instantiate hierarchical certificateless cryptography by formalizing the notion of hierarchical certificateless signatures. A concrete hierarchical certificateless signature scheme is also proposed. The security of our scheme is proven under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. As to efficiency, our scheme has constant complexity, regardless of the depth of the hierarchy. Therefore, our proposal is secure and scalable. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84900818518	Ciphertext-policy hierarchical attribute-based encryption with short ciphertexts	Attribute-based encryption (ABE) systems allow encrypting to uncertain receivers by means of an access policy specifying the attributes that the intended receivers should possess. ABE promises to deliver fine-grained access control of encrypted data. However, when data are encrypted using an ABE scheme, key management is difficult if there is a large number of users from various backgrounds. In this paper, we elaborate on ABE and propose a new versatile cryptosystem referred to as ciphertext-policy hierarchical ABE (CP-HABE). In a CP-HABE scheme, the attributes are organized in a matrix and the users having higher-level attributes can delegate their access rights to the users at a lower level. These features enable a CP-HABE system to host a large number of users from different organizations by delegating keys, e.g., enabling efficient data sharing among hierarchically organized large groups. We construct a CP-HABE scheme with short ciphertexts. The scheme is proven secure in the standard model under non-interactive assumptions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84901283018	Practical distributed signatures in the standard model	A distributed signature scheme allows participants in a qualified set to jointly generate a signature which cannot be forged even when all the unqualified participants collude together. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme for any monotone access structure and show its unforgeability and robustness under the computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the standard model. For 112-bit security, its secret key shares and signature fragments are as short as 255 bits and 510 bits, which are shorter than existing schemes assuming random oracle. We then propose two extensions. The first one allows new participants to dynamically join the system without any help from the dealer. The second one supports a type of multipartite access structures, where the participant set is divided into multiple disjoint groups, and each group is bounded so that a distributed signature cannot be generated unless a pre-defined number of participants from multiple groups work together. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

84901650915	Provably secure certificateless authenticated asymmetric group key agreement	Asymmetric group key agreement allows a group of members to establish a public group encryption key while each member has a different secret decryption key. Knowing the group encryption key, a sender can encrypt to the group members so that only the members can decrypt. This paper studies authenticated asymmetric group key agreement in certificateless public key cryptography. We formalize the security model of certificateless authenticated asymmetric group key agreement and capture typical attacks in the real world. We next present a strongly unforgeable stateful certificateless batch multi-signature scheme as building block and realize a one-round certificatless authenticated asymmetric group key agreement protocol to resist active attacks. Both the new multi-signature scheme and the resulting group key agreement protocol are shown to be secure under the well-established computational Diffie-Hellman and the k-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumptions in the random oracle model, respectively. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

84901654670	A provably secure ring signature scheme with bounded leakage resilience	Conventionally, the unforgeability of ring signature schemes is defined in an ideal environment where the attackers cannot access any information about the secret keys of the signers. This assumption is too strong to be satisfied in the real world since the cryptographic operations involves the secret key information leakage in various ways due to power/time consumption difference in operations on the 0/1 bits of the secret key. An attacker can obtain this information both passively by collecting power consumption information or actively by injecting faults during the signing operations. Thus, provably secure ring signature in the conventional security definition may be insecure in the real world due to the key information leakage. To address this problem, we formalize the first bounded leakage resilience definition for ring signature. A leakage resilient ring signature scheme remains secure even if arbitrary, but bounded, information about the secret key is leaked to an adversary. A bound on the leaked information is necessary because a ring signature cannot be secure if some signer's secret key is fully leaked. Then we propose the first ring signature scheme with bounded leakage resilience. Following the enhanced security definition with leakage resilience, the proposed scheme is provably secure based on the difficulty of the second l-representation problem in finite field. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

84904191000	Hierarchical identity-based broadcast encryption	We elaborate Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE) with a new primitive referred to as Hierarchical Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (HIBBE). Similar to HIBE, HIBBE organizes users in a tree-like structure and users can delegate their decryption capability to their subordinates, which mirrors hierarchical social organizations in the real world. Unlike HIBE merely allowing a single decryption path, HIBBE enables encryption to any subset of the users and only the intended users (and their supervisors) can decrypt. We define ciphertext indistinguishability against adaptively chosen-identity- vector-set and chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CIVS-CCA2) which captures the most powerful attacks on HIBBE in the real world. We construct an efficient HIBBE scheme against chosen-identity-vector-set and chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CIVS-CPA). The construction is built from composite order bilinear pairings and has constant size ciphertext. Analyses show that our HIBBE is efficient in terms of communication and computation that is suitable into practical usage. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84905228408	FRR: Fair remote retrieval of outsourced private medical records in electronic health networks	Cloud computing is emerging as the next-generation IT architecture. However, cloud computing also raises security and privacy concerns since the users have no physical control over the outsourced data. This paper focuses on fairly retrieving encrypted private medical records outsourced to remote untrusted cloud servers in the case of medical accidents and disputes. Our goal is to enable an independent committee to fairly recover the original private medical records so that medical investigation can be carried out in a convincing way. We achieve this goal with a fair remote retrieval (FRR) model in which either t investigation committee members cooperatively retrieve the original medical data or none of them can get any information on the medical records. We realize the first FRR scheme by exploiting fair multi-member key exchange and homomorphic privately verifiable tags. Based on the standard computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model (ROM). A detailed performance analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is efficient in terms of communication and computation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84906504763	Who is touching my cloud	Advanced access controls have been proposed to secure sensitive data maintained by a third party. A subtle issue in such systems is that some access credentials may be leaked due to various reasons, which could severely damage data security. In this paper, we investigate leakage tracing enabled access control over outsourced data, so that one can revoke the suspected leaked credentials or prepare judicial evidences for legal procedure if necessary. Specifically, we propose a leaked access credential tracing (LACT) framework to secure data outsourced to clouds and formalize its security model. Following the framework, we construct a concrete LACT scheme that is provably secure. The proposed scheme offers fine-grained access control over outsourced data, by which the data owner can specify an access policy to ensure that the data is only accessible to the users meeting the policy. In case of suspectable illegal access to outsourced data with leaked credentials, a tracing procedure can be invoked to tracing in a black-box manner at least one of the users who leaked their access credentials. The tracing procedure can run without the cloud service provider being disturbed. Analysis shows that the introduction of tracing access credential leakage incurs little additional cost to either data outsourcing or access procedure. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84906518949	Securely outsourcing exponentiations with single untrusted program for cloud storage	Provable Data Possession (PDP) allows a file owner to outsource her files to a storage server such that a verifier can check the integrity of the outsourced file. Public verifiable PDP schemes allow any one other than the file owner to be a verifier. At the client side (file owner or verifier), a substantial number of modular exponentiations is often required. In this paper we make PDP more practical via proposing a protocol to securely outsource the (most generic) variable-exponent variable-base exponentiations in one untrusted program model. Our protocol demonstrates advantages in efficiency or privacy over existing protocols coping with only special cases in two or single untrusted program model. We then apply our generic protocol to Shacham-Waters PDP and a variant of Yuan-Yu PDP. The analyses show that our protocol makes PDP much more efficient at the client side. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84906491931	Practical direct chosen ciphertext secure key-policy attribute-based encryption with public ciphertext test	We propose a direct Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) scheme with semantic security against adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA2) in the standard model. Compared with its counterpart with security against chosen-plaintext attacks (CPA), the cost of our scheme is only a Chameleon hash. In contrast to the Boyen-Mei-Waters shrink approach from CPA-secure (l∈+∈1)-Hierarchical Identity Based Encryption ((l∈+∈1)- HIBE) to CCA2-secure l-HIBE, our approach only adds one on-the-fly dummy attribute. Further, our approach only requires that the underlying ABE is selectively secure and allows public ciphertext test. A major obstacle for the security proof in this scenario is that the simulator cannot prepare the challenge ciphertext associated with the on-the-fly dummy attribute due to the selective security constraint. We circumvent this obstacle with a Chameleon hash. Technically, unlike existing use of Chameleon hash in (online/offline) signature applications, our work shows Chameleon hash can also have unique applications in encryption schemes. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

84908311873	Note on urbanization in China: Urban definitions and census data	The first release of the Sixth National Population Census results in April 2011 revealed that mainland China had a total population of 1339.72 million, of which 665.58 million resided in urbanized areas. This suggested that the urbanization process had accelerated during the period 2000-2010, with an increase of the urbanization rate from 36.09% to 49.68%. However, due to the incomparability of the Censuses data, caution must be taken when urbanists investigate or model Chinese cities by such datasets.

84908313252	The emergence of China's middle class: Social mobility in a rapidly urbanizing economy	The emerging middle class in Asian countries has attracted increasing scholarly interest because of its potential contribution to the global economy. The existing literature has revealed the unique characteristics of the Asian middle class compared to that of Western countries, and differences have been largely attributed to the compressed industrialization and rapid urbanization experienced in Asian countries. However a close examination on China's middle class at the individual level has yet to be seen. Using micro-data from two series of household surveys, this article first presents a comprehensive profile of China's emerging middle class. A binary logistic regression model was calibrated to investigate how an individual's middle class status was attained and impacted by his/her ascribed and achieved factors. The findings show that China's middle class possesses different consumption and occupation patterns from its counterpart in the West, and is not as reliant on government policies in attaining its status as has been documented in previous research. We argue that the rapid urbanization is generating agglomeration economies and improving social mobility, creating massive opportunities for people in lower social classes in China. Ascribed factors, for example parental achievements and hukou status, are thus gradually diminishing in importance for determining upward social mobility in China.

To ensure the security for group communication, group key management as a fundamental cryptographic primitive has been proposed. Although many proposals with regard to group key managemet have been introduced, they cannot be efficiently applied to realize secure subgroup and intergroup communications. In this paper, we propose two group key distribution schemes providing efficient solutions to these two problems. Our protocols do not require interaction between users. Storage and computation analyses show that our proposals are secure and efficient, compared with existing schemes. Based on those basic schemes, we further present extensions for multipartite groups, by which the efficiency is greatly improved in this scenario.

Yet there is an increasing demand for secure one-to-group communications in distributed computing applications. Asymmetric group key agreement (AGKA) is a handy tool to answer this need. In AGKA, a group of members can establish a group public key while each member has a different secret key. Any sender can encrypt under this group key such that any of the members who hold the secret key can decrypt. This paper proposes an identity-based AGKA protocol which is secure against active attackers, with an emphasis on optimal round efficiency, sender dynamics, and escrow freeness. The last feature offers security of the previously established ciphertexts even when either all the involved participants or the key generation center of the identitybased cryptosystem are compromised. The proposed protocol is shown to be secure under the k-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption in the random oracle model. Regarding performance, our protocol is comparable to the state-of-the-art AGKA protocols.

84912080273	Optimistic fair exchange of distributed signatures	Consider a scenario in which one party A consisting of a number of manufactories would like to sign a contract with another party B who is a selling company so that they can unify prices to avoid over competition. This may be done via Internet to reduce travelling cost. To cater for such applications, we propose the concept of optimistic fair exchange of distributed signatures (OFEDS) which allows an authorized set of signers to fairly exchange signatures with a verifier, and a trusted arbitrator will intervene in the protocol only when there are disputes between two parties. We consider the security requirements for OFEDS, in which besides the standard security requirements for existing optimistic fair exchange protocols, robustness is introduced to ensure that OFEDS can be successfully performed even when there exist some dishonest signers. We instantiate a non-interactive construction of OFEDS based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the random oracle model. Our work shows that for any general monotone access structure, there exists a CDH-based OFEDS protocol if all the involved signers are honest.

84912113764	A versatile cryptographic toolkit for flexible access control	Many data driven networks have been developed so that data can be collected and shared for bettering our life. Various cryptosystems are presented to address security and privacy issues in such emerging networks. Observing that implementing various cryptographic schemes separately in one system leads to undesirable heavy development and management overheads, we create a versatile cryptographic toolkit from Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) systems. Our toolkit supports attributes, indices, and identities based access control. We achieve this goal by converting some CP-ABE schemes into conventional Broadcast Encryption (BE) and Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption (IBBE) schemes. By configuring the system parameters, one can further obtain conventional Public Key Encryption and Identity-Based Encryption systems.
