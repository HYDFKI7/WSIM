20144370143	Bridge buffeting analysis in time and frequency domains	Using the same parameters, buffeting response of a cable-stayed bridge is analyzed respectively by time domain method and frequency domain method. The vibration shape, RMS, PSD of the buffeting response are studied to check the reliability of time domain analysis method for bridge buffeting. In time domain buffeting analysis, wind velocity field for the cable-stayed bridge is simulated by the spectral representation method. Buffeting force is adopted in quasi-steady form, and self-excited force is adopted in the form proposed by Lin. An iterative process is presented for the nonlinearity of self-excited force. The motion equations of overall bridge are solved by the Newmark-β method. In frequency domain buffeting analysis, multi-mode coupled buffeting analysis method is adopted. It is shown that the analysis results by the two methods agree well with each other, and time domain analysis method for bridge buffeting response is feasible and reliable.

22144450661	Dynamics of wind-rail vehicle-bridge systems	An analytical model for dynamics of wind-vehicle-bridge (WVB) systems is presented in this paper in the time domain with wind, rail vehicles and bridge modeled as a coupled vibration system. The analytical model considers many special issues in a WVB system, which include fluid-solid interaction between wind and bridge, solid contact between vehicles and bridge, stochastic wind excitation on vehicles and bridge, time dependence of the system due to vehicle movement, and effect of bridge deck on vehicle wind load and vice versa. The models of wind, vehicles and bridge are presented with wind velocity fluctuations simulated using the simplified spectral representation method, with vehicles modeled as mass-spring-damper systems, and with bridge represented by a finite element model. The interactions between wind and bridge are similar to those considered in conventional buffeting analysis for long span bridges. In considering difficulties in measuring aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles on bridge deck, the cosine rule is adopted for the aerodynamic coefficients of moving vehicles to consider yaw angle effect, and expressions of wind forces on moving vehicles are then derived for engineering application. To include mutual effects of wind loads, aerodynamic parameters of vehicles and bridge deck are measured, respectively, using a composite section model test and a specially designed test device. The dynamic interaction between vehicle and bridge depends on both geometric and mechanical relationships between wheels of vehicles and rails on the bridge deck. The equations of motion of the coupled WVB system are derived and solved with a nonlinear iterative procedure. A cable-stayed bridge in China is finally selected as a numerical example to demonstrate dynamic interaction of the WVB system. The results show the validity of the present model as well as wind effects on the rail vehicles and the bridge. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

23044506093	Effect of pylon stochastic wind field on buffeting response of long cable-stayed bridge	Only wind action of deck is generally taken into account in frequency-domain and time-domain buffeting response analysis for long-span bridge. In this paper, according to the features of the structural style and vibration mode of long span cable-stayed bridge, considering the correlation of the natural wind, overall stochastic wind field of long cable-stayed bridge can be simplified into several one-dimension stochastic wind fields. Due to the simplification, wind fields of deck and pylon can be simulated simultaneously. Based on simulated wind fields, wind load of long cable-stayed bridge can be expressed in time domain form. Further, motion equation of bridge can be built. Due to the existence of self-excited force, the motion equation is nonlinear. An iterative process is presented to solve the nonlinear equation. In order to indicate the pylon wind effect, buffeting response of a cable-stayed bridge is analyzed in two case: with pylon stochastic wind field and without pylon stochastic wind field. The comparisons of two cases show that pylon wind action can remarkably increase buffeting response of pylon in the direction across bridge.

24044525274	Wind tunnel experiment on the aerodynamic performances of H-shaped booms	On the basis of static aerodynamic force tests and dynamic response tests, the galloping and vortex-induced oscillation performances of H-shaped booms were investigated. The tests results indicate that H-shaped booms without taking any measures have galloping performance in low speed wind. H-shaped booms with holes in web have vortex-induced oscillate performance when the wind from landscape orientation. The amplitude of vortex-induced oscillation with square holes in web is smaller than round ones and is decreasing with the size of hole increasing, which indicate amplitude of vortex-induced oscillation can be decreased by putting poles in ventral-board when the wind from landscape orientation, but galloping still happen. Installing fairing on wing, there was no galloping happened, but the amplitude of vortex-induced oscillation increases a lot. By way of putting holes in wing, the galloping critical velocity of can be enhanced. The much bigger the poles are, the much better the effects are. It even can prevent galloping from happening.

3142533190	Simplifying the simulation of stochastic wind velocity fields for long cable-stayed bridges	The spectral representation method has been greatly developed as the performance of computer was enhanced. For the time-domain analysis of long cable-stayed bridge, it is required to simulate wind velocity histories at many points arranged on the overall bridge. However, the number of these points is usually so large that the spectral representation method obviously becomes computationally prohibitive. In this paper, a practical method is introduced to simplify stochastic wind velocity field for long cable-stayed bridges. According to the properties of both the structural type and the vibration mode of long cable-stayed bridge, and considering the correlation characteristics of natural wind, an overall three-dimensional (i.e. three components of natural wind) wind velocity field of a long cable-stayed bridge can be simplified into many one-dimensional (i.e. just one component) wind velocity fields, respectively, along pylons and deck. The wind fluctuation along each pylon can be simulated independently by omitting the wind velocity correlation between one pylon and another. Using the explicitly expressed Cholesky's decomposition of the cross-spectral density matrix, the wind velocity field along the deck can be simulated relatively fast. The FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) technique is adopted to further improve the computational efficiency. As an example, the stochastic wind field of a three-pylon cable-stayed bridge is simulated. The spectrum and correlation characteristics of the simulated samples are checked, which demonstrates that the simulation results agree with the corresponding targets. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Two situations are considered including empty and full depth of the aqueduct. Quadrilateral grid was used to divide the computational domain. The finite volume technique was adopted to discretize the governing differential equations. The pressure-velocity field was coupled using the SIMPLE algorithm. The reason why wind load shape coefficients are very close under previous two conditions is explained by introducing the research results of driven cavity flows. Also we obtain the vortex structure in the aqueduct for empty condition.

By a section model wind tunnel test with a scale of 1:20, the effects of railings, maintenance rail and guide vane on the vortex-induced vibration performance of main girder at a low damping were investigated, and the mitigation measure of setting guide vane inside the maintenance rail was applied in bridge engineering.

The dynamic responses of vehicles were investigated by the coupling vibration analysis of wind-vehicle-bridges (lines) systems. The influence of wind screen height, vehicle rail position and infrastructures type was discussed to indicate the effect of wind screens. The results show that the response of vehicle under the action of strong crosswind can be significantly reduced by wind screens, and the transient critical wind speed for flat ground railway is up to 50 m/s when the height of wind screen is 2.05 m. The wheel unloading rate, overturning coefficient and vertical acceleration of vehicles are more sensitive to the position of vehicle, and the response of vehicle along windward rail is larger than that of leeward rail. The type of infrastructure has a greater effect on the leeward vehicle response. The wind shielding effect of wind screen installed on high embankment railway is better when the height of wind screen is similar.

46749128566	Stability of suspension bridge catwalks under a wind load	A nonlinear numerical method was developed to assess the stability of suspension bridge catwalks under a wind load. A section model wind tunnel test was used to obtain a catwalk's aerostatic coefficients, from which the displacement-dependent wind loads were subsequently derived. The stability of a suspension bridge catwalk was analyzed on the basis of the geometric nonlinear behavior of the structure. In addition, a full model test was conducted on the catwalk, which spanned 960 m. A comparison of the displacement values between the test and the numerical simulation shows that a numerical method based on a section model test can be used to effectively and accurately evaluate the stability of a catwalk. A case study features the stability of the catwalk of the Runyang Yangtze suspension bridge, the main span of which is 1490 m. Wind can generally attack the structure from any direction. Whenever the wind comes at a yaw angle, there are six wind load components that act on the catwalk. If the yaw angle is equal to zero, the wind is normal to the catwalk (called normal wind) and the six load components are reduced to three components. Three aerostatic coefficients of the catwalk can be obtained through a section model test with traditional test equipment. However, six aerostatic coefficients of the catwalk must be acquired with the aid of special section model test equipment A nonlinear numerical method was used study the stability of a catwalk under a yaw wind, while taking into account the six components of the displacement-dependent wind load and the geometric nonlineariry of the catwalk. The results show that when wind attacks with a slight yaw angle, the critical velocity that induces static instability of the catwalk may be lower than the critical velocity of normal wind. However, as the yaw angle of the wind becomes larger, the critical velocity increases. In the atmospheric boundary layer, the wind is turbulent and the velocity history is a random time history. The effects of turbulent wind on the stability of a catwalk are also assessed. The wind velocity fields are regarded as stationary Gaussian stochastic processes, which can be simulated by a spectral representation method. A nonlinear finite-element model set forepart and the Newmark integration method was used to calculate the wind-induced buffeting responses. The results confirm that the turbulent character of wind has little influence on the stability of the catwalk.

In the test, aerodynamic influence among structural units is simulated. In order to measure steady aerodynamic force of line-like multi-body system, a separation device called Crossed Slot System is developed on basis of routine bridge section model measure device.

The vibration modes of the bridge are close to each other. Based on the multimode coupled buffeting analysis, coupled behavior in buffeting response of three-pylon cable-stayed bridges is investigated. Buffeting response of a three-pylon cable-stayed bridge is analyzed at design wind speed by multimode coupled analysis method and one-mode SRSS method, respectively. The coupled effect is neglected in one-mode SRSS (Square Root of Sum of Squares) method. RMS (Root Mean Square) and PSD (Power Spectral Density) of buffeting response by the two methods are compared with each other. In order to indicate the coupled relations among the analyzed modes, the evolution of buffeting response with a number of modes is analyzed. It is shown that there is significant coupled behavior in buffeting response of three-pylon cable-stayed bridges. The coupled interaction among analyzed modes can increase the buffeting response. The coupled effect of buffeting response should not be neglected in the refined analysis of long-span bridges.

71049146340	A study on spatial correlation and power spectrum of natural wind at xihoumen bridge	In design of a long-span bridge, gust response of the bridge is very important and must be taken into account. The long-span structure has low natural frequency, small mass and extremely low inherent damping. The spatial correlation and spectrum of the wind in the low-frequency range affect the gust response However, there are very limited field data about spatial correlation of natural wind and wind spectrum. In the wind-resistance design, the decay factor is set to be 7, which affects the wind-resistance design of a long span bridge. Therefore, natural wind were measured at Xihoumen Bridge and the wind speed spectrum and spatial correlation are calculated. The results show that the spatial correlation of the natural wind is lower than that specified in the wind-resistance design specification of China in the low-frequency ranges. The most appropriate wind spectrum and decay factors fitting to the field measurements are recommended. This means that there is a possibility of being able to modify the design specification of long span bridge concerning gust response. The calculated results provide credible technical guide to construction of Xihoumen Bridge and ensure wind resistance safety. © 2009 ASCE.

A long-term field measurement was carried out. The field data such as wind speed, wind direction, attack and yaw angles, etc, were measured. Detailed analysis of the field data and further study were conducted to investigate the wind characteristics. The measured wind data are analyzed to obtain parameters such as mean wind speed and wind direction, turbulence intensities, gust factors, turbulence integral length scales and spectrum of gust components. It is found that the turbulence intensities were larger than normal, and the ratio among the three components wasn't in good agreement with the recommended quantities in Wind-resistent Design Specification for Highway Bridges of China. And there was a tendency for the longitudinal and lateral turbulence intensities and gust factors to decrease with the increase of mean wind speed. The Kaimal spectrum and Panofsky spectrum models were identified to describe the energy distribution fairly well for the wind speed component in the longitudinal and vertical direction.

The results were compared with those from wind tunnel test. Meanwhile, the Reynolds number effect of mean force coefficient was studied. The results showed that the drag coefficient was obviously affected by Reynolds number. The drag coefficient derived from filed measurement was 15 percent less than that of wind tunnel test. On the contrary Reynolds number has a minimal effect on lift force and moment coefficient. Therefore, for very large bridges, wind tunnel testing of mean force coefficients should be conducted at Reynolds number as large as to be close to the prototype case, otherwise the results may be conservative.

80053528527	Numerical simulation of aerodynamic characteristics for static and dynamic vehicle-bridge system under cross wind	Nowadays, construction of railway network proceeds with high intensity in China, and a large portion of the network construction are bridges.

For every wind speed, free vibration test of section model is generally repeated several times in order to obtain more reliable parameter estimates. In the WELS method, many free vibration records at the same wind speed are regarded as an ensemble. The common mode parameters are then identified simultaneously from the ensemble data. The parameter fit is obtained by a nonlinear least-square method. Weighting factors are proposed to make each experiment record with the same weight in total residual error analysis. The ensemble composed of many records can reduce the effect of the colored noise of few records on the convergence of least-square iteration process.

They sag and flex in the complex wind environment, which is a different situation to ideal rigid cylinders in two-dimensional wind flow. Aerodynamic interference and the response characteristics of wake galloping of full-scale parallel cables are potentially different due to three-dimensional flows around cables. This study presents a comprehensive wind tunnel investigation of wake galloping of parallel stay cables using three-dimensional aeroelastic cable models. The wind tunnel study focuses on the large spacing instability range, addressing the effects of cable separation, wind yaw angle, and wind angle of attack on wake galloping response. To investigate the effectiveness of vibration suppression measures, wind tunnel studies on the transversely connected cable systems for two types of connections (flexibility and rigidity) at two positions (mid-span and quarter-span) were also conducted. This experimental study provides useful insights for better understanding the characteristics of wake galloping that will help in establishing a guideline for the wind-resistant design of the cable system on cable-stayed bridges.

84879108885	New formulation of Cholesky decomposition and applications in stochastic simulation	Monte Carlo simulation plays a significant role in the mechanical and structural analysis due to its versatility and accuracy. Classical spectral representation method is based on the direct decomposition of the power spectral density (PSD) or evolutionary power spectral density (EPSD) matrix through Cholesky decomposition. This direct decomposition of complex matrix usually results in large computational time and storage memory. In this study, a new formulation of the Cholesky decomposition for the EPSD/PSD matrix and corresponding simulation scheme are presented. The key idea to this approach is to separate the phase from the complex EPSD/PSD matrix. The derived real modulus matrix evidently expedites decomposition compared to the direct Cholesky decomposition of the complex EPSD/PSD matrix. In the proposed simulation scheme, the separated phase can be easily assembled. The modulus of EPSD/PSD matrix could be further decomposed into the modulus of coherence matrix (or lagged coherence matrix), which describes the basic coherence structure of stochastic process. The lagged coherence matrix is independence of time and thus remarkably improves the Cholesky decomposition efficiency. The application of the proposed schemes to Gaussian stochastic simulations is presented. Firstly, the previous closed-form wind speed simulation algorithm for equally-spaced locations is extended to a more general situation. Secondly, the proposed approach facilitates the application of interpolation technique in stochastic simulation. The application of interpolation techniques in the wind field simulation is studied as an example. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the research objects of structural wind engineering are bluff bodies, and the SST k-ω turbulence model is more widely used in the numerical simulation of flow around bluff bodies than the k-ε turbulence model. Therefore, to simulate an equilibrium ABL based on the SST k-ω turbulence model, the inlet profiles of the mean wind speed U, turbulence kinetic energy k, and specific dissipation rate ω are proposed, and the source terms for the U, k and ω are derived by satisfying their corresponding transport equations. Based on the proposed inlet profiles, numerical comparative studies with and without considering the source terms are carried out in an empty computational domain, and an actual numerical simulation with a trapezoidal hill is further conducted. It shows that when the source terms are considered, the profiles of U, k and ω are all maintained well along the empty computational domain and the accuracy of the actual numerical simulation is greatly improved. The present study could provide a new methodology for modeling the equilibrium ABL problem and for further CFD simulations with practical value. Copyright © 2013 Techno-Press, Ltd.

84882756242	Suppression of vortex-induced vibration of bridges using TMD based on linear empirical vortex-shedding forces model	Vortex-induced vibration is an aerodynamic phenomenon that occurs in long-span bridges at low wind speeds, and it is an issue in the wind-resistant design of long-span bridges. In order to suppress vortex-induced vibration of long-span bridges, the effects of TMD on the vortex-induced vibration of long-span bridges were investigated. The motion equations of the vibration system consisting of a bridge and TMD are established; then these motion equations are solved in a complex frequency domain, the frequency response functions of the vibration system are obtained, and the method to design optimal TMD parameters is given. The method presented is verified using a long-span suspension bridge. First, the wind tunnel test was performed using a 1:20 scale section model of the bridge in order to identify aerodynamic parameters of a linear empirical model for vertical vortex-induced vibration, then the influences of TMD parameters on vortex-induced vibration of the bridge were investigated. The TMD parameters optimization results show that the more the mass ratio, the higher the control rate, but at the same time, engineering economic and so on should be considered to determinate TMD mass; when TMD mass ratio is a constant, the frequency rate between TMD and bridges is closer to 1, and the phase difference is closer to π/2, the control rate is higher. The vortex vibration control rate will be affected when the TMD displacement was limited by the height of bridges, TMD displacement limit must be considered in the design of TMD. When the mass ratio is 1%, and optimal TMD parameters were designed, the vortex vibration of the bridge in a lock wind speed range has been effectively suppressed.

84884492030	Simulation method of porous wind screen scale model on bridge by wind tunnel tests	In order to investigate the simulation method of a scale model for a porous wind screen, the aerodynamic coefficients of vehicles under the action of a wind screen installed on the railway bridges are measured by wind tunnel tests. The wind screen is 2.05m high, with the porosity of 30%, and with different hole shapes. The effects of hole size and hole shape are analyzed, and the similarity between the wind screen with circular holes and the wind screen with longitudinal bars are discussed. The result shows that the circular hole size of a wind screen at the scale of 1:20 should be in the range of 8mm to 12mm; the hole shape of a wind screen with the same porosity has some certain effect on the aerodynamic coefficients of the windward vehicle; the longitudinal bar wind screen with more than 10 gaps is equivalent to a wind screen with the circular hole size of 8mm. The results could provide some references for the wind tunnel test and numerical simulation of a wind screen.

84885081881	Predicting of tall building response to non-stationary winds using multiple wind speed samples	Non-stationary extreme winds such as thunderstorm downbursts are responsible for many structural damages. This research presents a time domain approach for estimating along-wind load effects on tall buildings using multiple wind speed time history samples, which are simulated from evolutionary power spectra density (EPSD) functions of non-stationary wind fluctuations using the method developed by the authors' earlier research. The influence of transient wind loads on various responses including time-varying mean, root-mean-square value and peak factor is also studied. Furthermore, a simplified model is proposed to describe the non-stationary wind fluctuation as a uniformly modulated process with a modulation function following the time-varying mean. Finally, the probabilistic extreme response and peak factor are quantified based on the up-crossing theory of non-stationary process. As compared to the time domain response analysis using limited samples of wind record, usually one sample, the analysis using multiple samples presented in this study will provide more statistical information of responses. The time domain simulation also facilitates consideration of nonlinearities of structural and wind load characteristics over previous frequency domain analysis. Copyright © 2013 Techno-Press, Ltd.

With large commercial software FLUENT and by means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method, the 3D ambient flow fields of the windbreak ultra-high formworks for hollow high piers with integrated schemes of different height of internal and external formworks are analyzed in different incoming flow directions. The windbreak effect of the ultra-high formwork for high piers is evaluated so as to optimize the windbreak ultra-high formworks for hollow high piers based on the reduced comprehensive equivalent wind speed rate for construction personnel safety, concrete curing and construction overall efficiency. Results show that wind recirculation is formed by the incoming flow inside the hollow pier due to the blocking effect of the ultra-high formwork along windward side. The air flows clockwise from leeward side to windward side. The wind speed of windward side is slower than that of leeward side in hollow pier, and windward side in hollow pier can be the temporary shelter from wind for construction personnel. The optimal scheme with the reduced comprehensive equivalent wind speed rate 0.2 is that only external formwork is 1.5 m higher than concrete surface while the height of internal formwork is normal.

84886929015	Study on vehicle location on deck for the wind-vehicle-bridge system	Due to the existence of rail irregularities, there is a coupling vibration between moving trains and bridge. The vibrations of vehicles and bridge can influence each other. A static displacement of bridge will be initiated by the mean component of natural wind, while buffeting of bridge is excited by the stochastic part of natural wind on the other hand. The static and buffeting displacements of deck are equivalent to rail irregularities which are important for the vehicle-bridge coupling vibration. In cross wind, vehicles are loaded with both a lateral force and an overturning moment which may turnover vehicles. On the one hand, vehicles are in the ambient flow of deck. Aerodynamic loads on vehicles thus depend on the geometric shape of deck section to some extent. On the other hand, the existence of vehicles on bridge deck can change the ambient flow of deck. Thus the aerodynamic characteristics of deck cross section can be affected by the vehicles on deck. The aerodynamic loads on a certain segment of deck can vary with the arrival and departure of vehicles. The distributions of both aerodynamic loads on deck and the vehicle mass along the bridge span are continuously varying due to the forward movement of vehicles. Thus the wind-vehicle-bridge (WVB) system is a time dependent system. The aforementioned matters represent physical properties of the WVB system. Wind, vehicle and bridge are regarded as an interactional coupling vibration system in this paper. A dynamic analysis model for the WVB system is developed in time domain. The model can represent the fluid-solid coupling interaction between wind and bridge, the solid contact coupling interaction between vehicle and bridge, the stochastic action of wind on vehicles. In this model, wind velocity fluctuations are considered to be stationary Gaussian stochastic processes and are simulated by means of the simplified spectral representation method. All vehicles are modeled as mass-spring-damper systems. For a 4-axle railway vehicle, the total analytical DOFs (Degrees Of Freedom) are 23. The bridge model is built by FEM (Finite Element Method). The interactions among wind, vehicle and bridge are taken into account in detail. In the wind-vehicle-bridge system, vehicle is located in the ambient flow of deck. The aerodynamic force of vehicle depends on the location of vehicle. Taking the influence of vehicle location into account, the aerodynamic force coefficients of both vehicle and deck are obtained by wind tunnel test with a special device. Finally, using the self-developed analysis software BANSYS (Bridge ANalysis SYStem), Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge on Peking-Shanghai high speed railway is analyzed respectively in one case that vehicle is located on windward side of deck and in another case that vehicle is located on leeward side of deck. In the analysis, the influence of wind speed is also taken into account. It is showed by analysis result that considering the influence of vehicle location is necessary in the coupling vibration of the wind-vehicle-bridge system.

Firstly, actual measurement of wind velocity time histories is introduced, including data acquisition, processing and statistical analysis. Especially, in this part some power spectral density (PSD) functions which match the actual wind fields better are fitted by applying the nonlinear least square method and Kolmogrove theory. Then with the fitted PSD function as target, the turbulent wind velocity time histories are generated using the spectral representation method which introduces FFT technique and double-indexed frequencies. In the last part of the paper, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed methodology, with the simulated results checked. © 2009 Faculty of Construction and Land Use, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

Characteristics of cables of this bridge are investigated by the statistical method to determine the model parameters for wind tunnel tests. A series of wind tunnel tests are carried out to explore the effect of wind speed, inclined angle, yaw angle, rain precipitation and structural damping ratio on the rain-wind induced vibration of cables in cable-stayed bridges. The results show that cables are prone to rain-wind induced vibration in the combination of α=25°, 30° and β=25°, 30°, 35° at the predominate wind speed of about 12m/s; lighter rain can promate the rain-wind induced vibration of cables; and the rain-wind induced vibration is sensitive to the structural damping ratio.

An optimized section configuration was found for mitigating excessive amplitude of vibration which is much larger than the one prescribed by Chinese code. In order to verify the maximum amplitude of VIV for optimized girder, a full bridge aeroelastic model wind tunnel test was carried out. The differences between section and full aeroelastic model testing results were discussed. The maximum amplitude derived from section model tests was first interpreted into prototype with a linear VIV approach by considering partial or imperfect correlation of vortex-induced aerodynamic force along span based on Scanlan's semi-empirical linear model. A good consistency between section model and full bridge model was found only by considering the correlation of vortex-induced force along span. © 2013 Techno-Press, Ltd.

84890655585	Numerical simulation of wind-induced roof snow distributions based on time variable boundary	In order to predict snow deposition on a building roof under wind action, a numerical method based on the Euler-Euler two-phase mixture model was employed to simulate wind-induced roof snow distributions. In the method, the latest improved k-ω turbulence model is used to turbulence closure, and the computational domain boundaries uses the adaptive deformation technique based on snow depth changes. An example of numerical calculation was given to verify the validity of this method, and then snow distribution on a stepped roof was simulated. The time histories of roof snow distributions in some different states were gained. The simulation results show that along with the time development, the snow distribution on the roof has a great influence on air flow, and the snow deposition rate will change. The simulation results after 22 h are in good agreement with the field observation ones, and without considering snow effect on air flow, large errors will be result in. The simulation results for different velocity ratios are basically consistent. As the velocity ratio is smaller, the snow-depth coefficient gets larger, and the simulation time of reaching similar distribution becomes shorter.

84891909679	Aerodynamic stability of long-span bridges in post flutter	To provide reasonable explanations for the motion types of girder in post flutter status of long-span bridges, the nonlinear aerodynamic stability of bridge girder was analyzed based on an existing nonlinear motion-induced aerodynamic force (MIAF) model and the nonlinear vibration differential equation, by using the 4th Runge-Kutta algorithm. Four typical MIAF cases of streamline box girder with large vibration amplitudes were taken into account in the analysis. The results show that different types of motions would occur to the girder of long-span bridge in post flutter under conditions of different amplitudes and reduced velocities. The vibration of bridge girder will converge when the aerodynamic work is negative only or the negative work is larger than the positive one. The divergent motion will occur when the aerodynamic work is positive only or the positive work is larger than the negative one. If the aerodynamic positive and negative work are well matched to each other, the girder vibration will converge slowly because of the structural damping. If the aerodynamic positive energy is equal to that consumed by structure in the same period, an equal-amplitude vibration will occur. The motion of bridge girder could diverge if ignoring the nonlinear items of the motion-induced aerodynamic force.

84891625467	Nonlinear aerodynamic forces on thin flat plate: Numerical study	This paper first presents a numerical simulation of nonlinear aerodynamic forces on a thin flat plate through an integration of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method and the forced asymptotic oscillation method. The thin flat plate is forced to have either asymptotic torsional oscillation or asymptotic vertical oscillation of increasing amplitude. A multiple-domain mesh technique together with unstructured dynamic meshes is used in the CFD simulation to accommodate large amplitude oscillations of the plate. The instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of the aerodynamic forces are then identified from the simulated asymptotic aerodynamic force time histories using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) in terms of the CWT ridges. Extensive numerical studies are finally performed to examine the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results show that the CFD method used in this study can properly simulate nonlinear aerodynamic forces on the plate. The amplitude of the aerodynamic force depends on the amplitude of the forced oscillation and there are high-order harmonic aerodynamic forces of higher frequency than the forced oscillation frequency, both indicating the nonlinearity of aerodynamic forces. The results also show the flutter derivatives associated with self-excited aerodynamic forces depend on the amplitude of forced oscillation in addition to reduced velocity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In the testing, a comparison was between the original girder cross section and the girder section without rails and tracks in the attack angle of +5°. On top of this, the main factor that causes the vortex-induced vibration of the girder was due to the installation of guide rail in the bottom of the girder.

84892900708	Comparison of the spatial correlation of the buffeting force on long span bridge and wind fluctuations	Results of previous wind tunnel testing have shown that the span-wise correlation of the buffeting force on bridge deck is greater than that of the turbulent components. Due to the limitation of wind tunnel size and model scale, above-mentioned results were usually obtained for smaller separation along the span and the turbulent flow was generated by passive method. In order to study of the span-wise correlation of the buffeting force with large separation and different turbulent flow field, thorouphty lift buffeting force is taken for instance in this paper. Theoretical analysis method is employed to establish a reasonable mathematic model, and then the difference of the span-wise correlation between buffeting force and wind fluctuations was investigated by means of the wind spectra simkulation in wind tunnel and in natural atmosphere, respectively. The buffeting force that better correlated span-wise than the wind fluctuations applies only to certain interval in turbulent flow simulated in wind tunnel, while as in the natural atmospheric turbulent field, the correlation of buffeting force is between the longitudinal and vertical oncoming flow fluctuations. Finally, the empirical coherence function proposed by Davenport is employed to verify the validity of the analysis method.

84897789123	Wind-induced static and dynamic response of long span cable-stayed-suspension systems	Cable-stayed-suspension systems are characterized by the obvious three-dimensional ambient flow under wind action, which is actually a kind of complex wind effect. The cable-stayed-suspension system is sensitive to wind action and is prone to vibration due to its long span and flexibility. Taking the aerobus systems as engineering background, the aerodynamic coefficients of the main cable and guideway are firstly measured by a wind tunnel test with an 1:1 scale section model. Then, considering the interactions of wind, cable and guideway, the secondary development of the finite element software ANSYS has been carried out. The whole process of wind induced static and dynamic responses is simulated by automatical loading on the basis of the nonlinear three-dimensional finite element model of wind, cable and guideway. Finally, the static and dynamic responses of the cable and the guideway are obtained. The results show that the structure is flexible, and the lateral displacement of the cable and guideway is comparatively large at the design wind speed. The lateral response is dominated and much larger than the vertical response. The research conclusions can provide a reference for the design optimization of long span cable-stayed-suspension systems.

Model snow-depth distributions on the roofs were measured at various time intervals. The effects of velocity and wind direction were studied, and mass flux rates on the roofs were examined as well. The results show that, the saltation of particles decreases the turbulence intensity nearby the surface, and the effective aerodynamic roughness lengths of the field are proportional to square of the friction velocities. At wind direction of 0° the snow-depth distribution on the stepped roof is well consistent with the field observation. The snow-depth distributions on the stepped roof are much unbalanced under oblique winds, and especially at wind direction of 135° the snow-depth coefficients range from 0 to 1.7. The leeward side of the gable roofs may accumulate more snow at wind direction of 0°, and the maximum coefficients are 1.7 and 1.2 for slope 10° and 20° respectively. The mean mass flux rates on the roofs are proportional to velocities, implying that the mass transport rate increases with cube of the friction velocity.

84902592956	Wind induced response of long-span pipeline bridge in mountainous valley	In mountainous areas, meteorological conditions is complex. Airflow makes very adverse effects on pipeline bridges that span mountainous valley. Wind-resistant performance of long-span pipeline bridges has thus become one of the critical issues concerned in the design of pipeline bridges. This study summarizes the method for determining design wind parameters and proposes the design wind speeds at deck levels of two types of span structures, a long-span suspension bridge and a cable-stayed bridge in mountainous valley. Aerodynamic parameters of the girder are obtained for the two types of pipeline bridges via section model wind testing, which provide important parameters for wind-resistant design of the bridge. Full-bridge aeroelastic model testing is conducted to summarize the similarity relation of aeroelastic model and provide the model design and manufacture details of main beam, main cable or stayed-cables, pylons, and piers of the bridges. In particular, a U-shaped string is used to simulate the stiffness of girders. Wind-induced response characteristics of the two types of pipeline bridges are finally obtained through wind tunnel testing. Results show that truss pipeline bridge with a span less than 300 m has high safety quality of wind resistance. This work provides a reference and lays a foundation for future design of similar bridges in mountainous valley region.

84903750209	Analysis of rain-wind induced cable vibration using spatially measured aerodynamic coefficients	In most currently-used analytical models for studying rain-wind induced cable vibration, wind velocity relative to cable motion was determined by trigonometric decomposition and the aerodynamic coefficients of a cable were measured through wind tunnel tests using a horizontal cable model with two-dimensional flow field. In this paper, the aerodynamic coefficients of a cable were measured using a spatial cable model with a three-dimensional flow and an analytical model was developed to predict rain-wind induced cable vibration. The feasibility of the proposed analytical model was examined through the comparison with wind tunnel test results. The mechanism of rain-wind induced cable vibration was also investigated from viewpoints of rivulet motion and system energy. Further, an extensive parametric study was carried out in this study to investigate the properties of rain-wind induced vibration of a stay cable. The observation indicates that rain-wind induced cable vibration is essentially similar to cable galloping with limited amplitude, which is mainly induced by negative slope of lift coefficient curve and rivulet oscillation. The results from the parametric study indicate that the aerodynamic and motion parameters of cables may affect the maximum amplitude and the wind speed range for the occurrence of rain-wind induced vibration.

Three kinds of porosities and four kinds of heights are installed on three line structural forms.

The quantity of wind loads' sudden change and the dynamic responses of vehicles is considered as the input index. The protection effect of wind barrier is evaluated by data envelopment analysis (DEA) when the output is the same. The results show that the wind barrier with a certain height could increase the lift-drag ratio and is more likely to increase the lift coefficient. The method of comprehensive evaluation can be applied in the protection effect evaluation of the railway wind barrier and the comprehensive evaluation using the indexes of sudden change of vehicle wind loads is in agreement with the vehicle response index.

84907522560	Wind loads on a moving vehicle-bridge deck system by wind-tunnel model test	Wind-vehicle-bridge (WVB) interaction can be regarded as a coupled vibration system. Aerodynamic forces and moment on vehicles and bridge decks play an important role in the vibration analysis of the coupled WVB system. High-speed vehicle motion has certain effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of a vehicle-bridge system under crosswinds, but it is not taken into account in most previous studies. In this study, a new testing system with a moving vehicle model was developed to directly measure the aerodynamic forces and moment on the vehicle and bridge deck when the vehicle model moved on the bridge deck under crosswinds in a large wind tunnel. The testing system, with a total length of 18.0 m, consisted of three main parts: vehicle-bridge model system, motion system and signal measuring system. The wind speed, vehicle speed, test objects and relative position of the vehicle to the bridge deck could be easily altered for different test cases. The aerodynamic forces and moment on the moving vehicle and bridge deck were measured utilizing the new testing system. The effects of the vehicle speed, wind yaw angle, rail track position and vehicle type on the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle and bridge deck were investigated. In addition, a data processing method was proposed according to the characteristics of the dynamic testing signals to determine the variations of aerodynamic forces and moment on the moving vehicle and bridge deck. Three-car and single-car models were employed as the moving rail vehicle model and road vehicle model, respectively. The results indicate that the drag and lift coefficients of the vehicle tend to increase with the increase of the vehicle speed and the decrease of the resultant wind yaw angle and that the vehicle speed has more significant effect on the aerodynamic coefficients of the single-car model than on those of the three-car model. This study also reveals that the aerodynamic coefficients of the vehicle and bridge deck are strongly influenced by the rail track positions, while the aerodynamic coefficients of the bridge deck are insensitive to the vehicle speed or resultant wind yaw angle.

The research results show that the bridge may suffer serious vortex-induced vibration after the 2nd span is completed, and the vortex-induced vibration will exceed the specification limit. If the damping ratio is up to 1.2%, vortex-induced vibration amplitude can meet the specification requirement, and if the damping ratio is up to 2.1%, the vortex-induced vibration will be suppressed effectively.

The efficient measure to control the VIV is called spoiler grating fixed on the railing. The full bridge model wind tunnel tests were also conducted to obtain the buffeting response of the structure in different stages, and the buffeting of cantilever structures in construction stage was mitigated by using the temporary connecting cables.
