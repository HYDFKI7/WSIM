84942366816	Isotropic superresolution imaging for fluorescence emission difference microscopy	Fluorescence emission diffraction microscopy (FED) has proven to be an effective sub-diffraction-limited imaging method. In this paper, we theoretically propose a method to further enhance the resolving capability of FED. Using a coated mirror and only one objective lens, this method achieves not only the same axial resolution as 4Pi microscopy but also a higher lateral resolution. The point spread function (PSF) of our method is isotropic. According to calculations, the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the isotropic FED's PSF is 0.17λ along all three spatial directions. Compared with confocal microscopy, the lateral resolution is improved 0.7-fold, and the axial resolution is improved 3.1-fold. Simulation tests also demonstrate this method's advantage over traditional microscopy techniques.

This paper presents the design of the cell-based biosensor and optimization of the automatic fluidic system that makes it feasible to control the detecting process accurately, and the goal of which is to improve the maneuverability, repeatability and stability of sensor. In this study, excitable neural cells (rat cortical neurons or olfactory cell) are grown on top of the surface of the cell-based biosensor which is based on the principle of light-addressable potentiometric sensor. The optical beam is focused on the stimulated cell and the chip surface potential below the stimulated cell is recorded by the biosensor. Although the results demonstrate that this kind of cell-based biosensor has potential to monitor electrophysiology of living cell noninvasively for long term, the low signal-to-noise ratio so far hampers practical applications. © 2005 IEEE.

34248154618	Double-grating rapid scanning optical delay line for dispersion compensation	The axial resolution of optical coherence tomography (OCT) depends on not only the bandwidth of the light source but also the dispersion balance between the sample arm and reference arm. If the dispersion between two arms is not matched accurately, the axial resolution of optical coherence tomography system will degrade. Dispersion problem is very important especially in ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography system.

34248223515	Development of two dimensional scanning fiber probe excited by single actuator	A scanning fiber probe is developed to perform two-dimensional (2D) scanning for optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Orthogonal resonant oscillations are excited simultaneously and 2D scanning patterns are generated when it is actuated by one piece of piezoelectric bimorph through a driving signal with mixed frequencies near above mentioned resonances. The scanning sampling density crucial to imaging quality can be deliberately controlled by setting of the driving frequencies as well as fetching duration. Fine tuning the driving frequencies within the widths of intrinsic resonant curves of the designed fiber cantilever results in large scanning amplitude with different Lissajous trajectories and thus different scanning coverages are produced. For correct image reconstruction, a 2D position sensitive detector is also introduced in the developed probe to record the scanning pattern simultaneously. With the developed probe to the established OCT system, experiments on typical samples for en-face imaging are carried out at 2 frame/s. Those preliminary imaging results are presented in the paper.

The phase shifter that is almost independent of the wavelength over a broad range can provide phase shift at eight times of rotating angle of the half-wave plate. Conventional monochromatic phase-shifting algorithms can thus be adopted without systematic errors. Numerical analysis on phase shifting error and amplitude ratio between orthogonal polarization components versus wavelength over a range of 240 nm for nominal phase shifts required for the revised Carré algorithm and three-step phase-shifting algorithm respectively is conducted. The results demonstrate increased phase shift error and increased fluctuation of amplitude ratio for larger nominal phase shift.

In this paper, we provided a simple autofluorescence microscopy to investigate the fresh porcine IPE and RPE cells without any pretreatment. The results showed that the morphology and size of both were similar, round and about 15 μm. The main flourophore in both cells was similar, i.e. lipofuscin. In additional, the autofluorescence spectrum of RPE shifted blue after light-induced damage by laser illuminating. Because it was easier for IPE to be damaged by laser than for RPE, and the power of one scanning operation to get a full image was strong enough to damage IPE sample, we hadn't get any satisfied autofluorescence spectrum of IPE.

35648995829	Numerical analysis on RSOD-based phase modulation in OCT	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging technology for high-resolution bio-medical imaging. The rapid scanning optical delay line (RSOD) has developed basically for depth scanning and dispersion compensation. If the pivot center of the galvamirror in RSOD is offset, phase modulation can be realized, providing a high carrier frequency required for heterodyne detection. However, the size of galvamirror should be increased, leading to lower response for its oscillation and hence a low scanning rate. In this paper we propose to apply a sinusoidal waveform (resonant scan) instead of a triangle waveform (linear scan) to the galvamirror. Numerical analysis on phase modulation by RSOD and successive envelop demodulation under different driving waveform is conducted. We demonstrate that it is possible to improve OCT frame rate by resonant scan without compromising the signal-to-noise performance if complete and accurate envelope demodulation and appropriate signal processing are adopted.

The combined filters consist of a fiber Fabry-Perot tunable filter (FFP-TF) and a polygon mirror with scanning grating based filter. The FFP-TF has the narrow free spectral range (FSR) but ultra-high spectral resolution (narrow instantaneous bandwidth) driven at high frequency far from resonant frequency. The polygon filter in the Littrow configuration is composed of fiber collimator, polygon mirror driven by function generator, and diffractive grating with low groove. Polygon filter coarsely tunes with wide turning range and then FFP-TF finely tunes with narrow band-pass filtering. In contrast to traditional method using single tunable filter, the trade-off between bandwidth and instantaneous line-width is alleviated. The combined filters can realize ultra wide scan range and fairly narrow instantaneous bandwidth simultaneously. Two semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) in the parallel manner are used as the gain medium. The wide bandwidth could be obtained by these parallel SOAs to be suitable for sufficient wide range of the polygon filter's FSR because each SOA generates its own spectrum independently. The proposed swept laser source provides an edge-to-edge scanning range of 180 nm covering 1220 to 1400 nm with instantaneous line-width of about 0.03 nm at sweeping rate of 23.3 kHz. The swept laser source with combined filters offers broadband tunable range with narrow instantaneous line-width, which especially benefits for high resolution and deep imaging depth optical frequency domain imaging. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.

43249091908	Optical Doppler tomography with short-time Fourier transform and Hilbert transform	Optical Doppler tomography (ODT) combines Doppler principle with Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to image both the structure and the flow velocity of moving particles in highly scattering biological tissues. The flow velocity can be determined by measurement of the Doppler shift of the interference fringe frequency with a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) or a Hilbert transform. For STFT ODT, velocity resolution varies inversely with the Fourier transform window size at each pixel, while spatial resolution is proportional to the window size. Consequently, velocity resolution and spatial resolution are coupled. For phase-resolved ODT with Hilbert transform, high velocity resolution can be achieved while maintaining a high spatial resolution. However, the maximum determinable Doppler shift is limited by axial-line scanning speed. As a result, STFT ODT and phase-resolved ODT are applicable to measurement of high speed and low speed velocity, respectively. We use these two methods in the established ODT system. An in vitro model using a small circular glass tubule with flowing solution of polystyrene beads inside and an in vivo model of rat's cerebral arterioles are investigated, demonstrating the advantage and disadvantage of STFT ODT and phase-resolved ODT.

50849142605	Application of one-dimensional wavelet transformation in time domain optical coherence tomography imaging	Short time Fourier transform (STFT) is usually used to demodulate the interferometric signal and image reconstruction for time domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). STFT algorithm is simple, but cannot obtain good de-noising performance when the interferometric signal is demodulated. Therefore an additional de-noising in two-dimensional (2D) image domain is needed for reconstructed image. This method is time-consuming and incompact. In this paper, one-dimensional (1D) wavelet transformation (WT) was applied to demodulate signal and image reconstruction, furthermore, de-noise in wavelet domain could be completed at the same time. The interferometric signal was decomposed into different frequency ranges by WT and reconstructed only with these filtered coefficients whose frequency range covers the modulating frequency. After demodulating, tomographic image of sample could be reconstructed. Comparing with STFT followed by image de-noising, this method is more compact and efficient. Combining advanced de-noising technique in wavelet domain, this method has great potential in application.

Based on the resonance of the fiber cantilever with asymmetry structure which has two distinguished resonant frequencies in orthogonal directions, Lissajous pattern is produced suitable for two-dimensional scanning upon a sample. Orthogonal resonances of the fiber cantilever are simultaneously excited by single piezo bender actuator with one driving signal consisting of two components corresponding to above-mentioned two resonant frequencies. By integrating a backward-placed two-dimensional position sensitive detector (PSD) into the probe, real-time lateral position of the scanning pattern is registered simultaneously for image reconstruction. Dynamical characteristics of the fiber cantilever are experimentally studied with special consideration on factors determining the resolution of the scanning pattern, including frequency and amplitude ratios between two components of the driving signal and fetching duration used for an en face image.

79953802438	Reflective mesoscopic spectroscopy for noninvasive detection of reflective index alternations at nano-scale	Cancer has been one of the most serious threats to human life. However, there is no substantial improvement in overall treatment of cancer patients. One of the key reasons is the unavailability of convenient method to detect cellular alterations in ultra-early stage of carcinogenesis processes, where genetic aberrations at nano-scale have not yet resulted in histological changes. In this paper, we described an optical method based on reflective mesoscopic spectroscopy for ultra-early cancer detection. According to mesoscopic light transport theory, photons propagating in one dimension (1D) within a weakly disordered medium have the non-self-averaging effect. Reflected signal after 1D propagating is sensitive to any length scale of refractive index fluctuations due to multiple interferences of light waves travelling along 1D trajectory. The principle of mesoscopic spectroscopy for perceiving reflective index fluctuations at length scale of nanometers is introduced. A system for the measurement of reflective mesoscopic spectroscopy based on spatial-incoherence broadband source and spectrometer is established. Simulations on light propagation in cell-emulating model with controlled refractive index distribution are done by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) approach.

79954457968	Statistical characterization on refractive-index fluctuations of one-dimensional light propagating medium	A method based on reflective mesoscopic spectroscopy for characterization of refractive-index fluctuations at nano-scale is introduced. Mechanism of mesoscopic spectroscopy for perceiving reflective-index fluctuations at length scale of nanometers is revealed. Based on simulation by finite difference time domain method, light propagation in one-dimensional refractive-index variable medium and resulting reflective spectral characteristics are analyzed. Through precise control of standard deviation and spatial correlation length of refractive-index fluctuations along one-dimensional channel, simulated disorder strengths and their relation to theoretical settings are quantitatively analyzed. Results show that reflective spectrum is highly sensitive to disorder strength and thus it is feasible for the refractive index fluctuations at nano-scale within one-dimensional channel to be perceived through reflective spectrum. Under certain approximating conditions, disorder strength is proportionally enlarged with increasing variance and spatial correlation length describing refractive-index fluctuations. The proposed method might be useful in probing statistical structural changes at nano-scale which are unperceivable up to now, and hence avoiding the limitation due to optical diffraction in far field.

79960702073	A novel swept laser source based on combined tunable filters for oct	A novel broad tunable bandwidth and narrow instantaneous line-width linear swept laser source using combined tunable filters working at 1,300 nm center wavelength is proposed. The combined filters consist of a fiber FabryPerot tunable filter and a tunable filter based on diffractive grating with scanning polygon mirror. In contrast to traditional method using single tunable filter, the trade-off between bandwidth and instantaneous line-width is alleviated. Parallel implementation of two semiconductor optical amplifiers with different wavelength range is adopted in the laser resonator for broadband light amplification. The Fourier domain mode locking swept laser source with combined tunable filters offers broadband tunable range with narrow instantaneous line-width, which is especially benefiting for high-quality optical frequency domain imaging. The proposed Fourier domain mode locking swept laser source provides a tuning range of 160 nm with instantaneous line-width of about 0.01 nm at sweeping rate of 15 kHz, a finesse of 16,000 is thus achieved. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

79960789594	High-speed spectral domain optical coherence tomography signal processing with time-domain interpolation using graphics processing unit	Sensitivity and data processing speed are important in spectral domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) system. To get a higher sensitivity, zero-padding interpolation together with linear interpolation is commonly used to re-sample the interference data in SD-OCT, which limits the data processing speed. Recently, a time-domain interpolation for SD-OCT was proposed. By eliminating the huge Fast Fourier Transform Algorithm (FFT) operations, the operation number of the time-domain interpolation is much less than that of the zero-padding interpolation. In this paper, a numerical simulation is performed to evaluate the computational complexity and the interpolation accuracy. More than six times acceleration is obtained. At the same time, the normalized mean square error (NMSE) results show that the time-domain interpolation method with cut-off length L = 21 and L = 31 can improve about 1.7 dB and 2.1 dB when the distance mismatch is 2.4 mm than that of zero-padding interpolation method with padding times M = 4, respectively. Furthermore, this method can be applied the parallel arithmetic processing because only the data in the cut-off window is processed. By using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with compute unified device architecture (CUDA) program model, a frame (400 A-lines × 2048 pixels × 12 bits) data can be processed in 6 ms and the processing capability can be achieved 164,000 line/s for 1024-OCT and 71,000 line/s for 2048-OCT when the cut-off length is 21. Thus, a high-sensitivity and ultra-high data processing SD-OCT is realized. © 2011 World Scientific Publishing Company.

80052064509	Simulation and measurement of flow field in microchip	Cancer (malignant tumor) is one of the serious threats to human life, causing 13% of all human deaths. A crucial step in the metastasis cascade of cancer is hematogenous spreading of tumor cells from a primary tumor. Thus, isolation and identification of cells that have detached from the primary tumor and circulating in the bloodstream (circulating tumor cells, CTCs) is considered to be a potential alternation to detect, characterize, and monitor cancer. Current methods for isolating CTCs are limited to complex analytic approaches that generate very low yield and purity. Here, we propose a high throughput 3D structured microfluidic chip integrated with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor to isolate and identify CTCs from peripheral whole blood sample. The microfluidic velocity-field within the channel of the chip is mediated by an array of microposts protruding from upper surface of the channel. The height of microposts is shorter than that of the channel, forming a gap between the microposts and the lower surface of the channel. The lower surface of the channel also acts as the SPR sensor which can be used to identify isolated CTCs. Microfluidic velocity-field under different parameters of the arrayed microposts is studied through numerical simulation based on finite element method. Measurement on one of such fabricated microchips is conducted by our established optical Doppler tomography technique benefiting from its noninvasive, noncontact, and high-resolution spatial-resolved capabilities. Both simulation and measurement of the microfluidic velocity-field within the structured channel demonstrates that it is feasible to introduce fluidic mixing and causes perpendicular flow component to the lower surface of the channel by the 3D structured microposts. Such mixing and approaching capabilities are especially desirable for isolation and identification of CTCs at the coated SPR sensor. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

80052696293	Spectral phase based k-domain interpolation for uniform sampling in swept-source optical coherence tomography	We propose an efficient direct k-domain interpolation based on spectral phase in swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). Both the calibration signal from the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and the OCT imaging signal from the Michelson interferometer sharing the same swept source are detected and digitized simultaneously. Sufficient sampling of the OCT imaging signal with uniform k interval are directly interpolated in the k-domain based on the spectral phase derived from MZI calibration signal. Depth profile is then obtained from Fourier transform of the k-domain interpolated data. In vivo imaging of human finger skin and nail fold are conducted. Reconstructed images corresponding to different calibration methods are evaluated for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that improved imaging quality with enhanced resolution and signal-to-noise ratio is realized by the proposed method in contrast to the spectral phase based time-domain interpolation method as well as the intensity based calibration method. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

80455176603	Choroidal laser Doppler flowmeter with enhanced sensitivity based on a scattering plate	A portable choroidal laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) with enhanced sensitivity based on a scattering plate is developed. The portable LDF is weighted 2 kg operated at center wavelength of 780 nm, leading to a better penetration into the eye fundus in contrast to the previous LDF operated at center wavelength of 670 nm. Enhancement of number of detected photons that undergo Doppler scattering and improved measured speed of choroidal blood flow are achieved with the use of a scattering plate positioned in front of the eye. The mechanism of detection and sensitivity enhancement is theoretically analyzed. Evaluation of system performance is done by in vivo measurements on ten volunteers. The results demonstrate that an increased percentage of backscattering light at high Doppler shift frequency is collected due to utilization of the scattering plate. However, this kind of light detection influences spatial resolution of the system and decreases the total signal measured. The proposed method for detection and sensitivity enhancement might be useful in a case where the perception of very slight alternation of blood flow is pursued and the spatial resolution is not as critical as that in a choroidal vascular bed. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

82255167093	Higher-order cross-correlation-based Doppler optical coherence tomography	A method based on higher-order cross-correlation is proposed to fetch the Doppler information on flow velocity within areas under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The proposed method is theoretically developed and validated by measurement of a moving mirror with known velocities. Standard deviations of flow velocities of the mirror under different SNRs are determined by the proposed method and compared with those by the modified phase-resolved method. Measurement of flowing particles within a glass capillary is also conducted, and Doppler flow velocity maps of the glass capillary are reconstructed by both methods. All experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly suppress noise, thus rendering it suitable for flow measurement under low SNR cases. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

84860591841	Full-range swept source optical coherence tomography based on carrier frequency by transmissive dispersive optical delay line	A high speed swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system capable of full-range imaging is presented. Wave-number carrier frequency is introduced into the spectral interference signal by a transmissive dispersive optical delay line (TDODL). High carrier frequency in the spectral interference signal corresponding to an equivalent distance-shift is exploited to obtain full-range OCT imaging. Theoretical development is conducted with the instantaneous coherence function introduced for a complete description of a spectral interference signal. Performance advantage of the TDODL-based method over the conventional approachwhere only one side (positive or negative path length difference) is used for imaging to avoid overlaying mirror artifacts is confirmed by the measured envelopes of spectral interference signal. Feasibility of the proposed method for full-range imaging is validated in a custom-built SS-OCT system by in vivo imaging of a biological sample. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

84862990416	Flow velocity measurement based on speckle in optical coherence tomography	Flow velocity measurement based on speckle in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images is developed. Similar to traditional laser speckle signal, time-varying fluctuations in OCT speckle intensity is related to the average velocity of scattering particles within the sampling volume. Fluctuated signal of the speckle intensity is obtained from the detected OCT signal by filtering and demodulation. Then the spectrum of the speckle is deduced through Fourier transform of the fluctuated signal, and quantitative measurement of flow velocity can be conducted according to the calculated ratio of high to low (HLR) spectrum. The method of flow measurement based on speckle intensity in OCT instead of phase information is introduced. Investigation on the relationship of the calculated HLRs with the flow velocities is experimentally conducted. Flowing particles in a tube in mimic of capillary is visualized by the proposed method.

84863055290	Path length coded coherence combination for three-dimensional superresolution	Axial resolution and traverse resolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging are determined by different factors, while axial resolution is determined by both the coherence length of light source and the beam-focusing condition, and traverse resolution is determined by the beam-focusing condition of the sample arm. In the main approaches to axial resolution improvement in OCT, a light source with a broaden bandwidth is used and coherence gating is combined with apodization, which cannot improve the traverse resolution. A method is introduced to increase both the axial resolution and traverse resolution simultaneously in an OCT system by the path length code and coherent compounding method. Different effective functions are formed by adding a path length coding lens in to the proposed OCT system, which are corresponding to different path lengths. Owing to the intrinsic ability to differentiate path lengths, we can obtain several images of the same sample, corresponding to the different effective functions simultaneously. By adding these functions through numerically controlling their relative contributions, we can finally obtain a coherent compounding signal with three-dimensional superresolutions of axial resolution and traverse resolution. Compared with the previous approaches, the path length code and coherent compounding method is very easy to operate and its cost is very low, which can not only avoid the high cost and inconvenience in implantation, but also increase both axial and traverse resolutions simultaneously. © Chinese Physical Society.

84865366975	Application of optical coherence tomography to distance measurement of optical surface	A measuring system based on optical coherence tomography was established to measure the distance of optical surfaces non-contactly. The system was developed by modifying the sample scanning device based on a time-domain optical coherence tomographic system. The tomographic images of optical surfaces in different depths were acquired by moving the fiber collimator in sample arm through a high precision guide. The distance of an air gap sample and a lens were measured by using this system. Results show that the measured value of air gap sample is 6.026 mm while it is 6.02 mm by using a vernier caliper. Furthermore, the measured value of air gap in the lens is 10.750 mm while its design value is (10.7±0.03) mm. The systematic error is 3.871 μm and the sensitivity is 10.5 μm. The measurement method is characterized by non-contact, high precision, and high sensitivity, and has great potential in optical material testing.

84867271767	Imaging of skin microvessels with optical coherence tomography: Potential uses in port wine stains	The knowledge of vascular structures of port wine stains (PWSs) may be useful to select treatment doses and improve therapeutic efficacy. Biopsies are impractical to implement, therefore, it is necessary to develop non-invasive techniques for morphological evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the application of a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to characterize the vascular structures of PWSs. First, OCT images were obtained from the skin of healthy rabbit ears and compared with the histopathological images. Second, OCT was used to document the differences between PWS lesions and contralateral normal skin; the size and depth of the vascular structures of two clinical types of PWSs were measured and statistically analyzed. The dermal blood vessels of healthy rabbit ears were clearly distinguished from other tissue. There was no statistical difference between the vascular diameter or depth measured by OCT images and histopathological sections (P>0.05). The OCT images of the PWSs could be distinguished from normal skin. There was no statistical difference in the depth of vessels between the purple-type and the proliferative-type PWSs (P>0.05), while there was statistical difference in the diameter of vessels between them (P<0.01). Therefore, OCT is a promising, real- time, in vivo and non-invasive tool with which to characterize the vascular structures of PWSs.

84870866718	Axial superresolution by phase filter in optical coherence tomography	Axial superresolution in optical coherence tomography (OCT) by a three-zone annular phase filter is demonstrated. In the proposed probe of a spectral domain OCT system, the width of the central lobe of the axial intensity point spread function is apodized by the filter to be within the coherence gate determined by the light source, while its sidelobes are lying outside the coherence gate without contributing to the coherence imaging. By measurement of the depth response of the OCT system before and after inserting the filter, an improvement of about 20% in axial resolution is confirmed. OCT imaging on biological sample of orange fresh is also conducted, demonstrating increased depth discrimination without the negative contribution from sidelobes realized by the phase filter in combination with the coherence gate intrinsic to OCT. It comes to a conclusion that we can obtain axial superresolution by filter in OCT system without the degrading influence of large sidelobes. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

84879857314	Phase sensitive spectral domain optical coherence tomography for latent fingerprint detection	Despite the advances made in areas such as DNA profiling, fingerprints are still considered to be the best form of personal identification for criminal investigation purposes. A variety of physical chemical and optical techniques are available for the enhancement and detection of latent fingerprints. However, existing frequently-used fingerprint detection methods show some disadvantages such as harm to fingerprints, slow extraction, potential side effects, leaving trails, high contrast demand and so on. A new method based on phase sensitive spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) for latent fingerprints detection is proposed. This method has advantages of non-contact non-destructive, high-speed and high-sensitivity. The experimental results demonstrate that using this method to deal with fingerprints of low contrast also leads to satisfactory results, proving that the sensitivity of SD-OCT can be used for accurate and reliable patent fingerprint recognition. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

84891147760	A Highly Efficient Superresolving Phase Filter for a Radially Polarized Beam	We simulate the focal intensity distribution of a radially polarized beam, in view of the vector diffraction theory. We summarize two important rules: (i) the marginal ray of the aperture determines the focal size on the focal plane; (ii) the ratio of the longitudinal component to the transversal component affects the shape of the focus. We design a continuous phase filter using these rules for a confocal system. We chose the tangent of the semi-aperture angle to build up the phase function, because it is sensitive to the marginal rays, which have large aperture angles. To achieve a flexible modulation, we use a quadratic function for unwrapping the phase. We optimize the parameters of the quadratic function and achieve a transverse superresolving focus. Aiming at different Strehl ratios, we obtain a series of superresolution phase filters. Compared with others, the filter proposed has the advantages of superior superresolution effect and higher energy utilization ratios. The phase-filter design is universal and proved to be valid. It can be employed in either high or low NA systems, superresolving or donut focus applications. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

To yield high precision of measurement, reference interferometer sharing the same swept source with the measurement interferometer is introduced and a phase-sensitive approach based on phase-comparison between measurement signal and reference signal is exploited. The proposed phase-comparison method is theoretically developed and its merits over standard phase-sensitive approach are experimentally confirmed. In contrast to the standard phase-sensitive approach, the sensitivity under signal to noise ratio of 45 dB achieved by the phase-comparison method is improved from 222 nm to 25 nm and the processing time is shorten by 90%. Measurements of glass plates are performed to evaluate the performance of the developed system. Submicron precision about a range of 30 mm is realized by the developed system equipped by a commercial available swept source operating at a sweeping rate of 10 kHz.

84899011413	Orthogonal dispersive spectral-domain optical coherence tomography	Ultrahigh depth range spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) can be realized based on the orthogonal dispersive spectrometer consisted by a high spectral resolution virtually-imaged phased array (VIPA) and a low spectral resolution grating. However, two critical issues result in the challenge of obtaining desirable one-dimensional (1-D) spectra from the recorded twodimensional (2-D) orthogonal spectra for high-quality OD-SDOCT imaging. One is the wavenumber mapping errors and the other is the periodic intensity modulations. The paper proposes a method for desirable reconstruction of 1-D spectra from the recorded 2-D orthogonal spectra. A sample etalon with identical parameters to the dispersive VIPA is used to determine the free spectrum range (FSR) of the VIPA, and spectral phases from two reflecting mirrors are further applied for broadband wavenumber calibration. The cascading of column spectra are performed from interval of four lines of column spectra, and four records of cascaded 1-D spectra are obtained and then averaged to alleviate the periodic intensity modulations. Broadband 1-D spectra are thus reconstructed with an ultrahigh spectral resolution. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method, three typical samples are imaged by the OD-SDOCT system. © 2014 Optical Society of America.
