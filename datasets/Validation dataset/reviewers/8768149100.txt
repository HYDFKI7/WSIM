14044264821	Automatic layout design of plastic injection mould cooling system	This research extends our previous investigation of the automation of the preliminary design stage to the layout design stage of the cooling system design process. While the functional aspects of the cooling system are considered during the preliminary design stage, the layout design stage addresses both the functionality and manufacturability of the design. A graph structure is devised to capture a given preliminary design and a graph traversal algorithm is developed to generate candidate cooling circuits from the graph structure. Heuristic search is employed to develop the cooling circuits into the layout designs by generation of tentative manufacturing plans. A framework for fuzzy evaluation of the layout designs is developed to rate the various design alternatives generated. An experimental system is implemented to verify the feasibility of the approach, and examples generated from the system are presented to illustrate the major steps of the automatic design process. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

17244367058	Application of physical deformable curves to structural shape optimization	An anisotropic energy model of deformable curves is presented to provide shape modification of NURBS curve. The design boundaries are described by a linear combination of the mode shape vectors, which are derived from the eigenvectors of the finite element equations of the deformable design boundary curves, the design boundary deformation is then carried out through changes of the mode coordinates. Based on the present design variable representation and p-version finite element analysis, an integrated approach to structural shape optimization is discussed. A method is developed that enables the description of the shape to be adaptively refined during the shape optimization process. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the applicability of this approach to structural shape optimization.

2442653094	Flexible model of multi-axle vehicle ride comfort	In order to consider the influence of the bending vibrations of sprung mass on the multi-axle vehicle ride comfort. A flexible model of multi-axle vehicle ride comfort is presented by combining the vibration theory of elastic beam and the modal analysis method. According to assessment method of vehicle ride comfort, the whole vehicle ride comfort is simulated with the model presented. The simulation results show that the rigid model is not acceptable for the multi-axle vehicle ride comfort analysis. At the same time, the road running test of a five axle heavy vehicle is carried out. The modeling approach and the flexible model of ride comfort presented are proved to be feasible by the comparison between simulation results and test results at different speeds.

24744455980	Manufacturable and functional layout design of cooling system for plastic injection mould - An automatic approach	The cooling system of a plastic injection mould plays a significant role in determining the productivity and quality of the injection moulding process. In a previous research, a feature-based technique was developed that can generate automatically the preliminary design of the cooling system from a given plastic part. This paper reports a new method that can generate the layout design automatically from a preliminary design. The layout design process takes into account the functionality and manufacturability of the design. Given the preliminary design of a cooling system, candidate cooling circuits are generated by a specific graph traversal algorithm. Tentative manufacturing plans are then developed for the cooling circuits to assess the manufacturability. An experimental system is implemented to verify the feasibility of the method, and layout design examples generated by the system are given to demonstrate the method. © Professional Engineering Publishing 2004.

27544481399	A semantic-based approach for ontology construction in a collaborative design environment	The reasons why capturing domain concepts was the bottleneck of ontology construction were analyzed. Then a semantic-based approach for ontology construction in a collaborative design environment was presented. Firstly, terms were extracted from documents of multi-agent systems and congregated a term set after pretreatments. Then the concept set was built via semantic-based clustering according to semanteme of terms provided by WordNet. Next, a concept tree was constructed in terms of mapping rules between semanteme relationships and concept relationships. The ontology was constructed in an incremental way. A semi-automatic approach can avoid non-consistence due to knowledge engineers having different understandings of the same concept. The obtained ontology is easily to be expanded.

27844593872	A new approach to parting surface design for plastic injection moulds using the subdivision method	This paper proposes a new approach to automate the design of parting surfaces for plastic injection moulds. The new method tackles the issue of the automatic generation of a polygonal complex that is required for boundary curve interpolation. The mesh that defines the 'interior' of the surface patch is generated using medial axis transform and optimization. Upon subdivision, the mesh generates a smooth surface patch that connects to neighbouring patches to form the entire parting surface. This new method has been integrated with our previous result to develop an experimental system that automates parting surface design for a plastic part with a complex parting line. The major advantage of this new approach is that the subdivision surface is generated by a standard subdivision scheme which facilitates the development of any downstream applications, such as CNC tool-path extraction, on the surface. Examples and a design case study are presented to demonstrate the major steps and verify the feasibility of the new approach. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

The essence of the agile manufacturing strategy is to form a virtual manufacturing organization (VMO), which integrates the core competencies of member enterprises in order to respond to the global market and increasing customer requirements rapidly. In a VMO, the manufacturing processes are distributed. So modeling and coordination of these processes are very complex. In this paper, we present a Petri Net based approach to model these distributed manufacturing processes and interaction relations among them. A workflow based manufacturing process execution environment is also established to support the implementation of the distributed manufacturing processes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34447321855	Dynamic response simulation of lifting load system of ship-mounted cranes	The wave-induced motion of the crane ship can produce large pendulation of the cargo being hoisted and cause operations to be suspended. In this work, a nonlinear three-dimensional lifting load system dynamic model was set up based on the general form of Lagrange's equation. Basic crane maneuvers such as cable reeling and unreeling, are taken into consideration. The dynamic response of the cargo was studied using numerical methods. The result demonstrates that the dynamic response of the cargo depends on the length of cable, reeling and unreeling speed and wave frequency, and the in-plane angle have coupling with the out-of-plane angle.

In order to implement delivery strategy in different JIT environments, the single-setup-multiple-delivery (SSMD) model is studied. The number of deliveries, the focus of the SSMD model, is discussed emphatically. In the proposed SSMD model, the lead time of raw material supplier is considered and the production of the manufacturer is affected by the lead time. The cost functions of the supply chain, consisting of the raw material supplier, the manufacturer and the buyer, are built respectively. By minimizing the cost of the supply chain, the optimal number of deliveries is obtained in non-cooperation policy and cooperation policy separately. The interval of the number of deliveries, which can reduce the cost, compared to the single-setup-single-delivery model, is also analyzed in non-cooperation policy and cooperation policy. A numerical example is setup to confirm advantages of the proposed SSMD model. © 2006 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

34548379594	Research on modularized design and performance assessment based on multi-driver off-road vehicle driving-line	The multi-driver off-road vehicle drive-line consists of many components, with close connections among them. In order to design and analyze the drive-line efficiently, a modular methodology should be taken. The aim of a modular approach to the modeling of complex systems is to support behavior analysis and simulation in an iterative and thus complex engineering process, by using encapsulated submodels of components and of their interfaces. Multi-driver off-road vehicles are comparatively complicated. The driving-line is an important core part to the vehicle, it has a significant contribution to the performance. Multi-driver off-road vehicles have complex driving-lines, so performance is heavily dependent on the driving-line. A typical off-road vehicle's driving-line system consists of a torque converter, transmission, transfer case and driving-axles, which transfers the power generated by the engine and distributes it effectively to the driving wheels according to the road condition. According to its main function, this paper proposes a modularized approach for design and evaluation of the vehicle's driving-line. It can be used to effectively estimate the performance of the driving-line during the concept design stage. Through an appropriate analysis and assessment method, an optimal design can be reached. This method has been applied to practical vehicle design, it can improve the design efficiency and is convenient to assess and validate the performance of a vehicle, especially of multi-driver off-road vehicles.

34748823581	An ontology-based method for knowledge integration in a collaborative design environment	A collaborative design environment can be viewed as a multi-agent system where each design agent has knowledge about specific domains and can solve different problems. Several agents combine to solve a complex problem through knowledge sharing and inter operation. It is essential to construct an integrated knowledge base to improve the efficiency and consistency of complex problem-solving. An ontology-based knowledge integration framework in a collaborative design environment is presented in this paper. Ontology provides standard vocabulary, technical terminology and a domain model for knowledge integration. The representation and construction of ontology are critic problems for knowledge integration. An object-oriented concept graph representation is presented to represent ontology. It has advantages of both object-oriented methodology and Sowa's conceptual graph. It can be translated into predicate calculus conveniently, and can represent the intension of concepts. In order to improve the efficiency of ontology construction, a semantic-based approach is presented. Firstly, a semantic affinity based clustering algorithm is presented to generate concepts from the term set of multi-agent systems. Then, ontology is constructed based on knowledge. © 2006 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

36549029250	Adaptive fuzzy control and simulation of automatic transmission of tracked vehicle	Based on a basic fuzzy shift strategy, a two-stage adaptive fuzzy control system for automatic transmission of tracked vehicle was established to improve the adaptability of the control system for tracked vehicle on complex running conditions using parameter self-adjusting fuzzy control method. The basic fuzzy shift module implemented the fuzzification of throttle opening, vehicle speed and acceleration and fuzzy inference to decide shift position. According to the measured vehicle speed and acceleration, the adaptive fuzzy control module could identify linear running resistance and adhesive force of tracked vehicle and automatically regulated the fuzzy normalized factors. This system improves the shift quality of tracked vehicle under manifold driving conditions. So it has good robustness to uncertain vehicle parameters and external load disturbance.

37749038708	Dynamic response analysis of a moored crane-ship with a flexible boom	The dynamic response of moored crane-ship is studied. Governing equations for the dynamic response of a crane-ship coupled with the pendulum motion of the payload are derived based on Lagrange's equations. The boom is modeled based on finite element method, while the payload is modeled as a planar pendulum of point mass. The dynamic response was studied using numerical method. The calculation results show that the large-amplitude responses occur at wave periods near the natural period of the payload. Load swing angle is smaller for crane-ship with flexible boom, in comparison with rigid boom. The ship surge motions have large vibrations for crane-ship with flexible boom, which were not observed for a rigid boom. The analysis identifies the significance of key parameters and reveals how the system design can be adjusted to avoid critical conditions. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

The circle interpolation method and the polynomial method are widely used because they are simple and easily controlled. During adaptive measurements of a sculptured surface, the circle interpolation method and the polynomial method need more data points with the precision rapidly deteriorating as the surface complicity is increases. The present adaptive continuous curvature method assumes that the sculptured surface has n-order geometric continuity to measure object with sculptured surfaces. The system improves the precision and efficiency of the planned trajectory, and the reliability of the results.

39849107915	Plastic injection mould cooling system design by the configuration space method	The cooling system of an injection mould is very important to the productivity of the injection moulding process and the quality of the moulded part. Despite the various research efforts that have been directed towards the analysis, optimization, and fabrication of cooling systems, support for the layout design of the cooling system has not been well developed. In the layout design phase, a major concern is the feasibility of building the cooling system inside the mould insert without interfering with the other mould components. This paper reports a configuration space (C-space) method to address this important issue. While a high-dimensional C-space is generally required to deal with a complex system such as a cooling system, the special characteristics of cooling system design are exploited in the present study, and special techniques that allow C-space computation and storage in three-dimensional or lower dimension are developed. This new method is an improvement on the heuristic method developed previously by the authors, because the C-space representation enables an automatic layout design system to conduct a more systematic search among all of the feasible designs. A simple genetic algorithm is implemented and integrated with the C-space representation to automatically generate candidate layout designs. Design examples generated by the genetic algorithm are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

58049128552	Automatic order of data points in RE using neural networks	In this paper, a neural network-based algorithm is proposed to explore the order of the measured data points in surface fitting. In computer-aided design, the ordered points serves as the input to fit smooth surfaces so that a reverse engineering (i.e. RE) system can be established for 3D sculptured surface design. The geometry feature recognition capability of back-propagation neural networks is explored in this paper. Scan or measuring number and 3D coordinates are used as the inputs of the proposed neural networks to determine the curve to which each data point belongs and the order number of data point in the same curve. In the segmentation process, the neural network output is segment number; while the segment number and sequence number in the same curve are the outputs when sequencing the points in the same curve. After evaluating a large number of trials with various neural network architectures, two optimal models are selected for segmentation and sequence. The proposed model can easily adapt for new data from another sequence for surface fitting. In comparison to Lin et al.'s (1998) method, the proposed algorithm neither needs to calculate the angle formed by each point and its two previous ones nor causes any chaotic phenomenon. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

42449098571	Research on the selectable disassembly strategy of mechanical parts based on the generalized CAD model	Disassembly has gained much attention due to the growing concerns of material resources, energy conservation, and environmental conscious. The process of disassembly attempts to breakup a product into several pieces, with the expectation that the pieces together have a net value greater than the discarded product. In analyzing these aspects, one needs to determine all feasible ways to disassemble a product. This is especially true for the complex products like automobile, aircraft, etc. Most researchers took the algorithm of complete-disassembly planning to design for disassembly, although the feasible disassembly sequence can be obtained, parts of a assembled entity should be removed totally. And the required S (refers to disassembly sequence) could be gained through the proper analysis and evaluation; however, there are so many difficulties in this process and it is hard to obtain the optimum solution, especially when there are many parts in assembled body (such as automotive product). Therefore, it is very necessary to research the selectable disassembly algorithm of mechanical parts. This paper puts forward an algorithm on the selectable disassembly strategy of mechanical parts based on disassembly wave concept. It is comparatively easy and efficient to search, and get the optimal selectable disassembly sequence of mechanical parts with less amount of computing. It is so significant for all the steps of maintaining, recycling and discarding. © 2007 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

Some assumed conditions about the disassemblability of product assembly body and the disassembling process, and the parts mergence theorem were proposed. The product disassemble sequence planning algorithm and the product path planning algorithm were designed applicable to the product model built by using the commercial CAD software, Pro/Engineer. Then an improved method for geometrical intervene inspecting (GII) was put forward to transform three-dimensional intervene inspecting into two-dimensional one using the projection principle. Consequently the practical disassembly path could be approximated by the combination of multiple lines. The final drive and drive axle of a heavy-loaded off-road vehicle were taken as examples, through attaching constraints and definition to their three-dimensional models built using the Pro/Engineer platform, a generalized CAD model was established. The results show that the dynamical simulation and analysis of product assembly/disassembly can be realized in the analysis system of the generalized CAD model constructed with the secondary development based on Pro/Engineer CAD platform.

Furthermore, the hexapod does not need any control if it uses the tripod gait to achieve straight movement, due to the specific property of its leg. Because the efficiency of dynamics computation plays an important role in many applications, so we combine the AB algorithm of Featherstone which is suited for the manipulator with a fixed base, the Orin's DTS method which models the contact between the foot of robot with the ground, Brandl's method disposing constraint problems and a constraint violation stability method which selects the Baumgert parameters dynamically to process a dynamic analysis of the hexapod. At the same time, the hexapod dynamics is analyzed by ADAMS which adopts the Newton-Euler MBDA(multi-body dynamic algorithm) to process the dynamics analysis. The analysis results of the hexapod with these algorithms are compared to show the differences of the results using the two algorithms and distinguish which algorithms needs less calculation operations for the hexapod. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

The articulated-body (AB) algorithm which is efficient for the dynamics of a manipulator with a fixed base, the decoupled tree-structure (DTS) method which models the contact between the foot of robot and the ground and the hard-constraint method for treating the motion constraint problem are combined to process the dynamic analysis of the closed-loop mechanism. Meanwhile, a method which can select the Baumgert parameters dynamically is used to treat the violated constraint problem during the computational period. As a computational example, a hexapod using a closed-loop six-bar mechanism as its leg is developed based on the requirements of producing a small up-down change of the body when walking robot moves. The correctness of algorithm is validated by comparing the results of simulation of the hexapod in a program written by C++ based on the developed algorithm and ADAMS, meanwhile the motion displacement diagram shows that the hexapod satisfies the prescribed motion requirement.

77953774404	An analytical method for the forward kinematics analysis of 6-SPS parallel mechanisms	The displacement analysis of the general spatial 7R mechanism, which is an abstraction from the serial industrial robots, is regarded as one of the most difficult tasks in the kinematics analysis of spatial mechanisms. This problem is finally solved by Chinese scholars. There is dual relation between serial robots and parallel robots. The displacement analysis of 6-SPS parallel mechanisms is also a very difficult problem without substaintial progress made in the past ten years.

Solution zone was classified into two parts by kiss point position during casting strip. Navier-Stokes equation in fluid mechanics and stream function were introduced to analyze the rheological property of liquid zone and mushy zone, and deduce the analytic equation of unit compression stress distribution. The traditional hot rolling model was still used in the solid zone. Neural networks based on feedforward training algorithm in Bayesian regularization were introduced to build model for kiss point position. The results show that calculation accuracy for verification data of 94.67% is in the range of ±7.0%, which indicates that the predicting accuracy of this model is very high. © 2010 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79955658519	Analytical prediction of cutting forces in orthogonal cutting using unequal division shear-zone model	This paper presents an analytical method based on the unequal division shear-zone model to study the machining predictive theory. The proposed model only requires workpiece material properties and cutting conditions to predict the cutting forces during the orthogonal cutting process. In the shear zone, the material constitutive relationship is described by Johnson-Cook model, and the material characteristics such as strain rate sensitivity, strain hardening, and thermal softening are considered. The chip formation is supposed to occur mainly by shearing within the primary shear zone. The governing equations of chip flow through the primary shear zone are established by introducing a piecewise power law distribution assumption of the shear strain rate. The cutting forces are calculated for different machining conditions and flow stress data. Prediction results were compared with the orthogonal cutting test data from the available literature and found in reasonable agreement. In addition, an analysis of the deviation from experimental data for the proposed model is performed, the effects of cutting parameters and tool geometry were investigated. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2010.

0036303260	Mechanical product disassembly sequence and path planning based on knowledge and geometric reasoning	A feature-based assembly model is proposed for disassembly sequence planning, and establishing a correct and practical disassembly path for the part in the product, based on geometric reasoning and knowledge. The fundamental assembly modelling strategy for a product is based on the mating features of its parts. An algorithm is introduced which uses the information provided by the mating features of parts in the product to find the candidate parts for disassembly and to carry out disassembly path planning. A complete and accurate interference checking approach is used to ensure no global collision while disassembling a part. In some cases, it cannot be implemented by geometric reasoning alone, so a set of criteria and heuristic rules based on knowledge, constraints, relationships among parts, and quantitative disassemblability assessment are used. It can also be carried out interactively by the user when necessary. The proposed method is integrated with the CAD model of the product. The user can visually disassemble the product while planning, so it is easier to carry out the disassembly planning and generate an optimal sequence.

Then the as-cast strip was cold-rolled and annealed. The microstructure and texture evolution along the processing steps was investigated. It is found that inhomogeneous microstructure is produced in both cold-rolled and final annealed samples due to the large initial grains. The cold rolling texture is dominated by pronounced a-fiber texture and relatively strong g-fiber texture. The final recrystallization texture is characterized by {0 0 1}<0 10 >, {0 0 1}<2 1 0>, {1 1 0} <0 0 1> texture and a slightly shifted {1 1 1}<1 1 2> component.

It is shown that the initial microstructure and texture of cast strips can be controlled by changing superheat in the melt pool. At low superheat between 20 and 40 °C , cast strips with fully equiaxed crystals and random texture are formed. After cold rolling and annealing, in comparison with the conventional continuous cast slab, the equi-axed cast strip showed more homogenous and regular γ-fiber recrystallization texture by eliminating the shift to {334}<483> and almost disappeared α-fiber texture, thus increasing 7 value. Therefore, thin strip casting technique has advantage on improving the formability of ferrtic stainless steel.

84860872182	A new C-space method to automate the layout design of injection mould cooling system	A configuration space (C-space) method was developed in a previous study to support the automation of the layout design of cooling systems. The main function of the C-space is to capture all of the feasible geometry of the layout design so that a genetic algorithm (GA) can be used to explore the design space. This paper reports a further extension of the C-space method in two respects. The new method overcomes the previous limitation of the non-variability of the design topology. By capturing useful information generated during the computation of the C-space, the new method enables the GA to explore both the geometry and the topology of the design during the evolutionary process. A new technique is also developed that enables the method to handle user-defined constraints on the layout design. These constraints are captured by additional C-spaces, and a special procedure is developed for computing the C-spaces of cooling systems and generating candidate designs so that the resulting design always satisfies the constraints. Vigorous proof of the validity of the new method is provided, and a case study is presented to demonstrate the capability of the method in generating a practical layout design for a cooling system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A number of microstructures about the as-cast strips show that the initial solidification structure of casting a strip can be controlled by the melt superheats. The microstructures with the average grain size of ∼100-400 μm can be obtained in strips when the melt superheats are from 20 to 60 °C. A nearly random, diffuse, homogeneous texture under a low melt superheat, but comparatively developed {100} oriented grains are formed under a high melt superheat through the cast strip thickness. The relatively low core loss and high magnetic induction can be obtained in the cold rolled and annealed sheets when increasing the initial grain size of cast-strip. The textures in annealed sheets with coarse initial grain size are characterized by the relatively strong Goss component and {001} fiber but weak γ-fiber component, which lead to the high permeability. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A new scheme of using parallel mechanism as elastic structure and piezoelectric ceramic as sensitive element of the transducer is presented. The latter is also used to serve as pure-slide pair of parallel mechanism and traditional spherical pair is replaced by flexure spherical hinge. Three coordinates are set at mass-block, outer shell and ground, respectively, and their analytical relationships of position and attitude are established according to the theory of multi-body system. Based on Newton-Euler method, the dynamic equation of the system was established. By introducing aided angular velocity and using quaternion to describe rotation matrix and angular velocity vector, the problem was transformed into two initial value problems of first-order ordinary differential equations which was solved by improved Euler method, thus six-axis accelerations could be entirely decoupled. Method of generalized inverse for matrix was used to treat the violated constraint problem of quaternion, and an effective revised algorithm with repeatable calculation was presented. Based on the established decoupled model and algorithm, a numerical example was computed. The results were well consistent with the simulation ones in ADAMS, and the relative error between them was acceptable. Meanwhile, the time for data processing was no more than that of sampling. At last, the experiment was done, which shows the rationality of the proposed scheme and the reliability of the mathematical model.

The relaxation length is an important parameter in studying tire lag property. It decreases with increasing slip angle. It plays an important role in the study of tire transient properties.

84878041042	Kinematics analysis of redundant parallel mechanism based on tetrahedral configuration	According to the actuality that practical application of parallel mechanism is limited by less flexibility, large joint errors, and strong nonlinear coupling, a new redundant parallel mechanism based on tetrahedral configuration was proposed. The degree of freedom and singularity behavior of the mechanism were both analysed based on the theory of reciprocal screw. Coupling characteristics were given quantitatively by the method of topology. Three-point method was used to derive the analytical expression of forward kinematics, and the errors were compensated by obtaining the minimum norm solution of constraint equations. Above results show that kinematics characteristics of the proposed parallel mechanism are superior, which provide forceful conditions for further controlling steadily, in real-time and accurately.

Up to now, the distribution pattern of muscle fiber in heart is not well established, and it is hard to establish the constitutive model for atrial tissue completely based on the microstructure level. Consider the equivalence between the fractional viscoelasticity and the fractal spring-dashpot model, a generalized fractional order Maxwell model is proposed to model the porcine atrial tissue in the phenomenological sense. This model has a simple expression and intuitively physical meanings. The constitutive parameters in the model are estimated in the complex domain by a genetic algorithm. Final results illustrate the proposed model gets a well agreement with the experimental data. © 2013 The Korean Society of Rheology and Springer.

84878658897	Effect of secondary cooling on non-oriented electrical steel strips produced by twin-roll casting process	Effect of secondary cooling on non-oriented electrical steel strips was investigated. The 2.0 mm thick cast strips contain two compositions were produced by twin-roll casting process, cooled in the air or cooled by spraying water. The microstructure was observed by optical microscopy, and' EBSD was used to characterize the texture of the cast strips. The results showed that air-cooling cast strips have uniform and equiaxed grains with average size of 250 μm. The microstructure of the water-spraying cast strips compose of most equiaxed grains and a small number of abnormal big grains. At the same time, the secondary cooling rate mildly affects the cast texture strength but has no influence on the texture type. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84880482130	Performance modeling and structure optimizing of six-axis accelerometer	According to the present situation that performance index of six-axis accelerometer has no normative evaluation standard and theoretical calculation model, mathematical models of three single performances including fundamental frequency, sensitivity and width of error interval are established. The function of multi-objective on contradictive parameters is given based on modified ideal point method. The results show that at the design stage of six-axis accelerometer, first mode can be calculated using matrix iteration method. The statically indeterminate reverse dynamics equations about sensitivity model are calculated by constructing compatibility equations. Considering the uncertain errors, three theorems about width of interval are proposed and proved to reveal the mechanism of error transmission which can be used to direct the improvement of measuring accuracy. With the function of comprehensive performance, three major issues of multi-objective optimization can be solved effectively, and the map of six-axis accelerometer can be drawn.

84880656832	AlN precipitates and microstructure in non-oriented electrical steels produced by twin-roll casting process	Aluminum nitride (AlN) precipitates and microstructure of 4 wt.% (Si+Al) non-oriented electrical steel were investigated. The 2.0 mm thick cast strips with three different silicon/aluminum (Si/Al) ratios were produced by twin-roll casting process, then the strips were reheated, warm rolled, cold rolled and annealed. The microstructure and AlN precipitates were characterized using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that with the increase of Si/Al ratio, on the one hand, the casting microstructure changed from columnar grains to equiaxed grains, and the uniformity of annealed microstructure was improved; On the other hand, the number of AlN precipitates in cast strips reduced meanwhile the distribution became dispersed. By the reheat treatment, the size and distribution of the AlN precipitates can be changed. Moreover, the grain size of the annealed strips is in the range of 20-50 μm, at the same time, many AlN precipitates were located at grain boundaries. Therefore, controlling the Si/Al ratio is a simple method to obtain desired microstructure. Then AlN precipitates in non-oriented electrical steel prepared by twin-roll casting process hinder markedly the recrystallized grains growth. A compatible reheat treatment can be an approach worth exploring to control the behavior of AlN precipitates. © The Chinese Society for Metals and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84880376646	Aero-engine rotor-stator rubbing position identification based on casing strain signals	In order to effectively identify aero-engine rotor-stator rubbing positions, an identification method based on casing strain signals is proposed. Two experiment projects are proposed and compared. One is to paste the strain foils along the casing axial direction, the other is to paste them along the casing circumference. A rotor experiment rig of an aero-engine is used to simulate rubbing faults of different radial rubbing positions. The casing strain signals of the rotor experiment rig of the aero-engine is collected and the strain mean features of the two experiment projects are extracted, which are then input into a support vector machine to identify the different rubbing positions. The results show that the strain mean features based on the experiment project which paste strain foils along the casing circumference can effectively identify the rotor-stator rubbing positions of the aero-engine, and the recognition can reach 100%. But the strain mean features based on the project which paste strain foils along the casing axial direction has a lower recognition rate.

84883697070	Design and analysis of a tactile sensor used in minimally invasive surgery	At the present, tactile sensor technology can be found many applications in many industrial and medical areas, and is still attracting more and more research attention. In this paper, a new tactile sensor, focusing on the characterization of different tissues, is designed. Tissue characterization plays an important role in minimally invasive surgery which lacks the force feedback. Consider a compatible configuration requirement, this sensor possesses a circular cross-section that makes it easily be integrated and miniaturized on a catheter tip. To measure the static contact information, the sensitive element in this sensor is made of semiconductive polymer composite. Comparing with other tactile sensors, this sensor possesses a gap between the sensitive element and the plastic plate, which allows the blood flowing so as to reduce the blood effect. To verify the functionality of this sensor, the interactions between the sensor and two different elastomers, as two surrogates for two kinds of tissue in different hardness, are analyzed in finite element analysis. In either case with or without blood effect, the results of finite element analysis show this sensor can distinguish the selected materials. However, the sensor's output with blood effect is larger than that without blood effect. © 2013 IEEE.

84885098071	The frictional contact analysis between a tactile sensor and atrial tissue in viscoelasticity	This paper discusses the effect of friction in tool-tissue interaction of surgical simulation. The focus of this research is on mitral valve repair by robot-assisted surgery (RAS) method with tactile feedback. Heart tissue is considered to be touched by a tactile sensor with considering the friction effect. A regularized Coulomb law analogous to elastoplastic theory is used to represent the friction. Since the heart tissue is subjected to repeated loading condition, a generalized standard solid chain is chosen for modeling the heart tissue. To implement the generalized standard solid chain in finite element analysis (FEA), a new splitting strategy is presented. The splitting strategy avoids the complicated conversion procedure from creep function to relaxation function by dividing the total problem into several subproblems. The penalty method is used in the derivation of continuum model for the interaction between the tactile sensor and the tissue. By performing linearization for the continuum model, the discrete model for the FEA is obtained. Numerical results are obtained by using the constitutive parameters of tissue and friction coefficient, which were found experimentally. © 2013 Imperial College Press.

84888081985	Parameter identification of parallel type six-axis accelerometer	The parameter identification of a six-axis accelerometer is a difficult problem due to its higher input and output volumes and linear dynamic equation. According to this, a four-step method was proposed to identify the 25 decoupling parameters of a parallel type six-axis accelerometer. A calibration platform based on double slider-crank mechanisms was designed and processed to provide the external stimulation and a virtual instrument based on LabVIEW was developed to provide the software support for the parameter identification. The first sets of parameters were identified by averaging pretreatment data in static state. By putting the sensor on the platform to do a pure line movement with the frequency of 1-2 Hz, the dynamic equations were simplified to linear algebraic equations, then the second set of parameters were identified by using the least square method. Similarly, the third set of parameters were identified when the sensor did a pure angular movement with the frequency of 1-2 Hz. The fourth set of parameters were identified by one-dimensional searching about stiffness to mass ratio when the sensor did the pure line movement with the frequency of 4-5 Hz. Experimental results indicate that the maximum relative error is 7.479% after using the identified parameters to decouple the six-axis acceleration, which reduces a magnitude compared to that before parameter identification. Above results verify that the proposed four-step method is correct and feasible.

84891857056	Study and comparison of two decoupling algorithms for six-axis accelerometer	According to the facts that the development of a six-axis accelerometer was limited by technical bottleneck, Newton-Euler equation in configuration-space and Hamilton canonical equation in phase-space were used to derive the complete decoupling algorithms of the six-axis acceleration respectively. The advantages of the two algorithms were independent on external devices and unrestricted by the motion law of carriers compared with traditional algorithms. Decoupling mechanism was revealed by contrasting the accuracy, efficiency and numerical stability of the two algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively. Meanwhile, five selection principles of decoupling algorithms were obtained. Physical prototype was installed on a standard vibration exciter, and the experimental results consistent to the theoretical analysis.

84894582774	Force-free control for the direct teaching of robots	For the direct teaching of robots, a torque control based force-free control algorithm is proposed. Usually, it is difficult to calculate gravity torque and friction torque from the model directly. The relationship between joint torque and rod weight, joint positions, loads, coulomb friction, viscous friction and other factors are investigated, a gravity and friction compensation algorithm by means of robot's self-measuring is proposed. The measuring program for the compensation parameters is also given detailly. The proposed compensation algorithm is verified in a self-developed robot driven by DC motors, and the experiment results show that the torque compensation is obvious and the robot teaching is easy and flexible. Compared with existing position control based force-free control, the proposed algorithm can work without multi-axis force sensor, with simple control system-architecture and low cost. Therefore, the algorithm may open up a way for the direct teaching of those robots working with various complex trajectory. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84901190971	Identifying rotor-stator rubbing positions using the cepstrum analysis technique	The method of aero-engine rubbing positions identification based on cepstrum analysis is proposed. The transfer path characteristics which reflect the transfer characteristics information from rubbing points to casing measuring points are separated from the vibration acceleration signals of casing by means of cepstrum analysis. Therefore, there is different transfer characteristics information at different rubbing positions, and in view of this, twenty rubbing positions identification features are extracted. A large number of rubbing experiments of different positions are simulated with the rotor experiment rig of aero-engine, and the characteristic analysis of experimental samples at different rubbing positions is carried out, and the results indicate the consistency of features to the same rubbing position and the difference of the features to the different rubbing positions. Aero-engine rubbing positions identification is carried out using the nearest neighbor classification method. The recognition rate reaches 100%, and the effectiveness of the method is full verified. © 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

84914697585	Research on the abnormal grain growth of goss grains in strip-cast 4.5%si grain-oriented electrical steels	In conventional production of grain-oriented electrical steel, the content of silicon is limited to 3.0%∼3.4%, which could control the ‘γ→α’ transformation process to obtain fine grain sizes in hot-rolling and disperse AlN particles in normalizing. In this study, the precipitation behaviors of S ans N in 4.5% Si-Fe alloy are inhibited during twin-roll strip casting process. And then the ideal microstructure and texture was obtained after the two-stage cold rolling and primary annealing. The evolution of microstructure and texture during the subsequent high temperature annealing were investigated. The results revealed that a sharp and developed Goss texture has been achieved by secondary recrystallization in the final annealing step and the magnetic induction B8/Bsis above 1.76/1.90T.

12444341969	Flexible 2-DOF steering model of multi-axle heavy-duty vehicle	A flexible two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) steering model of multi-axle vehicle (MAY) is presented considering the effect of frame flexibility based on the classic 2-DOF model. A method to calculate the frame flexibility is derived by using three moments equation. The steering stability of MAV is analyzed. And the steering performance of MAV is also researched in frequency domain. Simulation results show that the dynamic effects of flexible model are more severe than rigid model and the flexible effect of frame will weaken the steering stability of MAV. Different disposals of steering axles lead to different steering characteristics of MAV. The in-phase steering mode improves the steering characteristics and stability at high speed. The anti-phase steering mode increases the steering mobility at low vehicle speed.
