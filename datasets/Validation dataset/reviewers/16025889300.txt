84927949604	Single buoyancy load to trigger lateral buckles in pipelines on a soft seabed	For exposed subsea pipelines, lateral buckles are usually artificially triggered as an accommodation technique to release thermal expansion by providing temporary flotation with controlled spacing. With the given buoyancy load, the pipeline will be uplifted initially and will then buckle laterally under a certain thermally induced axial load, which is called the bifurcation load. Previous studies have analyzed this problem and modeled the uplifted pipeline as a fixed-fixed end beam, assuming the lateral seabed stiffness is infinite. However, the lateral seabed stiffness is usually low because the seabed is formed from soft soils. Using analytical methods, this paper investigates the buoyancy load required to trigger lateral buckles along a pipeline, considering a seabed with finite elastic stiffness, and provides suggestions for the buoyancy design with an elastic-plastic seabed model using an example of finite-element analysis. It was found that the seabed condition significantly influenced the flotation design.

The general element is improved in which both the effects of smearing and well resistance are taken into account inside the composite sand-wall element, therefore the drawback of the huge amount of element number and node number adopted in the general finite element analysis is overcame. The sand-wall composite element is incorporated in the finite element procedure USAP. Compared with other solutions of sand drain ground under plane strain condition and finite element analysis software PLAXIS, the calculated result of the improved element is reasonable and models both the effects of smearing and well resistance well. Compared with the general finite element analysis, it's proved that the composite element could reduce the calculation significantly whereas the accuracy of calculation is assured.

33645786548	Poisson ratio of natural structured clays in non-linear elastic model	According to the formation mechanism of structure the natural clays are classified into three classes: normally consolidated clay, simply over-consolidated clay and structured clay with post-sedimentation structure. Based on the fact that in the process of structural deformation the faster deformation of a certain amount of bonding inhibits the development of secondary compression, so that, the lateral pressure coefficient of the clay can be assumed as the coefficient of normal consolidated soil. Based on the relationship between the tangent Poisson ratio and tangential lateral pressure coefficient and according to the test data of natural clay, it is proposed that the behavior of tangent Poisson ratio is in a pattern with three phases with turning points of gross yield stress and transition stress. The formula for calculating the tangent Poisson ratio of structured soft soil is deduced by generalizing this concept to the condition of triaxial loading. By this method the problem of determining the Poisson ratio of nonlinear elastic model can be solved.

The structural strength consequently was reduced and the engineering properties changed. The field disturbance during construction, such as the installing of vertical drain, was distinct from the sample disturbance. Based on the mechanism of field disturbance, a new method for modifying the compression curve of disturbed soil was developed. Then, the evaluation of the field disturbance degree was discussed associated with the results of the vane test in situ. Furthermore, the additional settlement due to the field disturbance and the compression behavior of disturbed soil were analyzed considering the varied structural strength with depth and varied compressibility during the process of loading. The computed results of typical examples indicated that settlements due to field disturbance could be predicted by the proposed method and the field disturbance had a significant influence on the compressibility of natural soils, which should be emphasized in practice.

34547993549	Construction control and monitoring of shield tunnels under newly-built sea embankments	The shield method is often used for the inflowing and draining shield tunnels in the construction of power plants. However, the soil will be considerably disturbed due to this method, and it will affect the deformation and stability of sea embankments. Meanwhile the post-construction settlements of thick soft sublayer will result in the longitudinal differential deformation. Then the interaction between the tunnels and embankments is the key problem to be solved. The inflowing and draining shield tunnel in the Datang Nengde Power Plant was taken as an example, and practical and effective measures were suggested based on the numerical analysis of the settlement of embankments and the differential deformation of the shield tunnel. Based on the analysis of monitoring data, the conclusions about the behavior of the tunnel and the recommended construction rate were proposed. These results would provide a scientific reference for the design and construction control of similar shield tunnels in practice.

34547604278	State-space solution of seabed-geotextile systems subjected to cyclic wave loadings	Analytical solutions for dynamic responses of seabed-geotextile systems subjected to cyclic wave loadings are presented in this paper, which contains the solutions of the transient and harmonic responses. The theory is based on the Biot consolidation equations in which the pore fluid as well as the soil skeleton is considered compressible and the flow in the porous seabed is assumed governed by Darcy's law. The present analysis is completely based on the state-space formulations, which is very effective for laminated systems analysis. Together with Laplace-Fourier transform techniques, state-space methods are used to solve the governing equations. Responses of seabed-geotextile systems can be calculated by using the matrix theory, boundary conditions and inverting integral transform. As illustrative examples, laboratory experiments, which conducted at the Oregon State University Wave Research Facility in USA by McDougal [1981. Ocean wave-soil-geotextile interaction. Ph.D. Dissertation, Oregon State University], are analysed. It is shown that the numerical results are in good agreement with those obtained from laboratory experiments, and the distinction between the transient and harmonic response should be taken into account for design of marine geosynthetic systems. Under the transient condition, the seabed is apt to liquefy. Seabed stability may be increased by placing geotextile beneath an armour layer. The numerical evaluations of the solution in the seabed-geotextile systems can be easily achieved with high efficiency and accuracy. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

35748941977	Experimental investigation on wave-induced response of seabed	Experimental investigation is conducted in a wave flume in order to identify the wave-induced response of sandy and silty seabed. Comparing with the theoretical pressure, the test results indicate that measured pressure on the surface of the model seabed is slightly affected by the soil fill. In a silty seabed, the excess pore pressure mounts distinctly due to the progressive wave, whereas there is no such phenomenon in a sandy seabed. The mechanism of pore pressure generation in a silty seabed is discussed using the experimental data. Three types of modes for excess pore pressure generation are developed by signal analysis. An improved method using geotextile is proposed to strengthen the silty seabed. The test results show that the excess pore pressure falls remarkably and that the silty seabed can be prevented from liquefaction by use of geotextile.

37349023591	Experimental investigation on the wave-induced pore pressure around shallowly embedded pipelines	A series of regular wave experiments have been done in a large-scale wave flume to investigate the wave-induced pore pressure around the submarine shallowly embedded pipelines. The model pipelines are buried in three kinds of soils, including gravel, sand and silt with different burial depth. The input waves change with height and period. The results show that the amplitudes of wave-induced pore pressure increase as the wave period increase, and decay from the surface to the bottom of seabed. Higher pore pressures are recorded at the pipeline top and the lower pore pressures at the bottom, especially in the sand seabed. The normalized pressure around pipeline decreases as the relative water depth, burial depth or scattering parameters increase. For the silt seabed, the wavelet transform has been successfully used to analyze the signals of wave - induced pore pressure, and the oscillatory and residual pore pressure can be extracted by wavelet analysis. Higher oscillatory pressures are recorded at the bottom and the lower pressures at the top of the pipeline. However, higher residual pressures are recorded at the top and the lower pressures at the bottom of the pipeline.

An exact formulation is developed for the dual integral equations governing the mixed boundary-value problem of the vertical vibration. By finding an approximate solution to the exact governing dual integral equations, an evaluation of the amplitude response of the rigid disk is presented for the case of a frictionless contact both between the disk and the stratum and between the stratum and the foundation. The influences of parameters regarding the disk and the elastic stratum on the amplitude response of the disk are discussed. It is concluded that the amplitude response of the disk is dependent on the exciting frequency, the depth of the stratum, the Poison's ratio of the solid skeleton, the porosity of the medium and the radius and mass of the disk. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the emergence of viral strains resistant to clinically studied IN inhibitors demands the discovery of novel inhibitors that are structurally as well as mechanistically different. Herein, a series of quinazolinones were designed and synthesized as novel HIV-1 inhibitors. The new synthetic route provides a practical method for the preparation of 5-hydroxy quinazolinones.

84897939941	Seepage induced soil failure and its mitigation during suction caisson installation in silt	Suction caisson is an advantaged foundation option for offshore wind turbines in sandy and clayey soils. In this work, a series of model tests were conducted to investigate the installation behavior of a suction caisson in silty soils. The test results showed that the total soil resistance to the caisson increased steadily with penetration depth in the beginning of the suction-assisted penetration (SP) process, but rose slowly or remained constant after reaching a certain depth with excessive soil heave. This failure mechanism, which was quite different from that identified in sandy or clayey soils, was caused by the seepage induced silt soil failure in the caisson, such as erosion, liquefaction or piping, with reducing internal side friction and tip resistance. To suppress this type of failure, a special filtration method was introduced to help caisson penetration. The test results showed that such filtration technique had the advantage of reducing the height of soil heave and prevent seepage induced soil failure in the silt, but also suppress the under pressure effects on reducing the soil resistance. Numerical simulations were also performed to aid in understanding the observed test results and mitigation mechanisms. © 2014 by ASME.

Thus, the negative skin friction occurs if the movement of pile is upward. Taking the in-situ test of negative skin friction on punched cast-in-place pile of Ninghai Power Plant Project for example, the influence of the soil consolidation around pile on the downdrag forces and the position of neutral point are studied. Different subsurface soil settlements are measured within and outside the two sets of piles, suggesting different influential degrees of the piles on the surrounding soil. The positions of the neutral point obtained from the measured settlement curves of soils and piles agree with the ones from the variable curve of pile axial force with depth. The measured maximum coefficients of side skin friction around piles are consistent and they vary between 0.3 and 0.4. Furthermore, based on the test results, the effect of pile construction technology on negative skin friction is analyzed. It is commended that the calculation of the settlement distribution is emphasized in the design for the negative skin friction piles. These conclusions are useful for engineering practice, which may guide the design and construction of similar projects.

As the length of arc burning time can do great influence on the arc energy and the two-phase change process of the break arc directly, it is significant for us to do some researches on its influence factors and change laws. To take the DC break arc between the low power relay contacts for an example, the paper studied the arc burning processes of two typical arc plasma - high purity nitrogen arc and air arc. When the relay contacts break resistant or inductive loads, it gained the relationships between the arc burning time with different atmospheres and load characters, as well as the change laws of arc burning time with the change of arc current and voltage.

The limit bearing capacity of the foundation as well as the potential instability regions of the soil is studied. According to Hill's sufficient stability condition, when the local second order work of the soil system is negative, the local region becomes potentially instable; when the global second order work of the system is negative, the system arrives limit state, and becomes potentially instable, thus the limit bearing capacity of the system is the load applied to the system at the moment. The influence of dilatancy angle on the bearing capacity is studied. Results show that, when the dilatancy angle is much smaller than the frictional angle, the limit bearing capacity computed by finite element method(FEM) with Hill's sufficient stability condition is close to theoretical solution of the equivalent material, and smaller than that of regular FEM. When the dilatancy angle is close to the frictional angle, the results of FEM with Hill's sufficient stability condition and the regular FEM are close and both can give preferable solution. The FEM with Hill's sufficient stability condition can also give the potential instability regions of the soil system, which can depict the surface failure mode and field failure mode simultaneously. Since the FEM with Hill's sufficient stability condition has a solid and clear theoretical background and therefore it is convenient to use, it is a deserved method for recommendation.

77955554197	Quasi-static three-dimensional analysis of suction anchor mooring system	The suction anchor has been widely used in taut or semi-taut mooring systems as an effective and economical solution to anchoring problems. To ensure high reliability, the profile of the mooring cable connecting the fairlead and the pad-eye must be accurately designed. However, previous studies have rarely considered the effect of cable slippage in soil on the mooring behavior, or embedded cables have been studied with an assumed tension at the seabed. This paper, by treating the cable suspended in water and the cable embedded in soil as a single cable, presents a two-dimensional (2D) static model and a three-dimensional (3D) quasi-static model for the cable during pretensioning and in service, respectively. The two models take into account the comprehensive effects of ocean currents, soil resistance and cable elasticity, all of which are critical for the design of a mooring system.

Most researchers simplify the seabed to be rigid and the water to be calm, ignoring the pipe embedment into the seabed and the influence of ocean currents. In this paper, a novel numerical approach is proposed for the laying of pipelines in the so-called J-lay method, taking into account the importance of both pipe embedment and ocean currents. The pipeline is divided into two parts, one part suspended in water, and the other laid on the seabed. The continuity of the two parts at the touch down point (TDP) is guaranteed to make a whole. The feasibility of the model is proved by the comparison between the present model and an analytical model, which shows good agreement in both pipeline configuration and bending moment distribution. Finally, parametric study was performed to consider the influence of current velocity, water depth, top inclination angle, and seabed stiffness, and conclusions are drawn. © 2010 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

78649745815	Three-dimensional interaction between anchor chain and seabed	Following the suction anchor installation, preloading of the anchor chain has to be carried out to remove slack. The assessment of a pretension level should take into account not only the additional chain slippage that may occur in service, but also the chain tension at the pad-eye which is transferred from the touchdown point (TDP) at the seabed. In this paper, a novel quasi-static model, which has considered the three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of soil resistance and chain elastic elongation, is presented to provide an accurate prediction of the behavior of an embedded chain. Based on this model, the chain profiles and tension distributions under different pretension levels are first calculated. While experiencing larger environment loads in service, the embedded chain will produce further movement in 3D space, which can be obtained by taking the chain equilibrium after pretensioning as the initial condition. Finally, the influence of pretension loads and angles at the TDP on the behaviors of embedded chain are thoroughly studied, and some useful conclusions are drawn. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79451474515	Rocking vibrations of a rigid circular foundation on poroelastic half-space to elastic waves	A study is carefully conducted for the rocking response of a rigid circular foundation resting on a poroelastic half-space when subjected to seismic waves under the framework of Biot's theory. The free-field waves, rigid-body scattering field waves and radiation scattering field waves are introduced to consider the complex behavior of the soil owing to the scattering phenomena caused by the existence of the foundation. The contact surface between the soil and the foundation is supposed to be perfectly bonded and fully permeable. Combining with the divided wave fields, two sets of dual integral equations elaborating the mixed boundary-value conditions are established, and then reduced to Fredholm integral equations. Therefore, with a semi-analytical method, the expressions of the rocking displacements are obtained. The numerical results of the rocking vibration of the foundation for incident P, SV and Rayleigh waves are presented. The influences of certain parameters, such as the permeability of the soil, the incident angle, Poisson's ratio and the mass of the foundation, on the rocking vibration of the foundation are explored and studied. Different reactions are found when the foundation is excited by different waves. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79951712973	Magnetic field effect in organic light emitting diodes based on BAlq	The current and electroluminescence(EL) of magnetic field dependent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with the structure of ITO/NPB(40 nm)/BAlq(60 nm)/BCP(5 nm)/LiF(0.8 nm)/Al were measured at room temperature. It has been found that the efficiency increases by up to 34% as the magnetic field increases to 10 mT, which suggests that the increase of device efficiency is due to the conversion of triplets into singlets through triplet-triplet annihilation. The current-voltage characteristic curves show that the resistances of devices increase with magnetic field increasing from 10 mT to 50 mT. In addition, the luminescence change ratio and the efficiency change ratio are decreased with increasing magnetic field, which is because the singlet polaron-pairs are regenerated to the secondary charge carriers, and are accumulated at the potential barrier interface.

79952444768	Global buckling of pipelines in the vertical plane with a soft seabed	Offshore pipelines are usually buried to avoid damage from fishing activities and to provide thermal insulation. Provided that the buried pipelines are sufficiently confined in the lateral direction by the passive resistance of the trench walls, they may be subject to vertical buckling caused by a rise in temperature. Vertical buckling is usually called upheaval buckling because the heated pipeline is assumed to move upwards conventionally. However, the seabed may be very soft, especially where a pockmark or abyssal ooze appears. Consequently, under thermal compressive force, the pipeline may buckle downward and penetrate into the seabed because the downward soil resistance is small. In this study, we extended an analytical solution for vertical pipeline buckling on a rigid seabed to a soft seabed, and the effects of soil resistance on pipeline stability, buckling mode and amplitude are illustrated and analyzed. © 2011.

The effects of embedment ratio and soil non-homogeneity on the bearing capacity are investigated in detail. The capacities of spudcan under different pure loading are expressed in non-dimensional bearing capacity factors, which are compared with published results. Ultimate limit states under combined loading are presented by failure envelopes, which are expressed in terms of dimensionless and normalized form in three-dimensional load space.

79958833294	Synthesis and biological evaluation of isosteric analogs of mandipropamid for the control of oomycete pathogens	A series of isosteric analogs of mandipropamid were designed and synthesized via 'click chemistry'. The amide bond of mandipropamid was substituted by a 1,2,3-triazole functional group. The bioassay results have indicated that some of the title compounds exhibited moderate fungicidal activity against Pseudoperonospora cubensis, and the activity has been systematically studied as a function of molecular structure. The low activity of the mandipropamid analog that contains a lipid chain is likely due to the presence of a weak hydrogen bond donor in the 1,2,3-triazole. Furthermore, we have performed the molecular modeling and found that N-methylamide could be more effective than amide as the surrogates to 1,2,3-triazole, which ultimately leads to a longer distance (1.1Å longer) between the two substitutes in the 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazole compound. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Such structure takes full advantage of the hole blocking and luminous properties of DPVBi, and it is propitious to keep the balance of the blue light from DPVBi, the green light from Alq3 and the yellow light from Rubrene. Thus the device can emit white light which has better performance. The effects of the thickness of DPVBi on the performance of WOLEDs were discussed. When the thickness of DPVBi was changed from 10 to 25nm and that other materials kept fixed, the device performance changed greatly. The best performance of the device was obtained when x = 20nm.

79960891245	Construction behavior simulation of a hydraulic tunnel during standpipe lifting	In China, the vertical lifting method is typically applied when building the water intakes of hydraulic tunnels in the seabed in China. In this work, a 3D finite element method was employed to investigate the dislocations of joints, the stress distribution of segments and the bolt inner force during the lifting of the standpipe. Because the loading conditions of the tunnel during different construction phases vary greatly, a numerical model with three loading phases corresponding to different construction phases was established. The radial and circumferential bolts and the interactions between segments and standpipes were investigated. The critical issues associated with the design and construction of hydraulic tunnel, including the inner force of liners, the inner force of bolts and joint dislocations were vigorously analyzed. The results indicated that due to the jacking up of ceiling segments and the imposition of the lifting force, the maximum dislocation, which occurred at the crown between the open ring and the adjacent ring, increased with the lifting force. Although the maximum dislocation was within the allowable range, the maximum inner force of bolts caused by dislocations was close to the ultimate strength. As a result, it was concluded that special attention should be given to controlling of the lifting force, and protection measures should be adopted to reduce dislocations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiment is carried out under different depths of saltwater. Then, through comparing the measured results with those obtained by numerical FDTD analysis for verification, the target reflection interface can be distinguished in waveform figure; the depth and shape image of riprap bottom boundary are investigated after calculating travel time difference and velocity. According to influence of saltwater on GPR signal, the experimental results indicate that the GPR is effective to identify the riprap bottom boundary of coastal embankment without saltwater. When model is submerged by seawater, the dielectric coefficient and electrical conductivity of media increase significantly. Moreover, the detecting error increases with the submergence depth and the interface image appears fuzzy. By using the linear characteristic of influence lines obtained from the forward simulation, the error of model experiment is corrected. Therefore, it can provide the basis for GPR application in coastal embankment.

80053956279	Behavoir of installation for suction anchor in soft clay	Suction anchor foundations are being increasingly used for a variety of offshore application. In designing a suction anchor geotechnical engineering must consider the installation process as well as the in-place performance. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the penetration behavior of the suction anchor in normally consolidated and sensitive clay. Numerical analyses are preformed to study the installation by suction in soft clay. The effects of the penetration depth, the shear strength ratio along the interface between the anchor and the clay on the installation process on the failure mechanism and the pattern of soil flow at the anchor tip during installation are discussed in detail. The shear strength reduction factor is the key factor of the installation procedure, and it has a strong effect on the limited installable aspect ratio. The displacement vectors show that the clay beneath the anchor tip will move up inside the anchor when the anchor moves down while soils beneath the tip as well as soils outside the skirt wall also flow inward at the reverse bearing capacity failure. Finally, some conclusions are made, which can be useful in practice. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

84855604327	Model tests on installation techniques of suction caissons in a soft clay seabed	A series of model tests have been carried out in order to investigate the behavior of suction caissons during installation in a soft clay seabed and explore more effective installation techniques. The test results indicate that when the suction pressure instead of dead weight is adopted to help penetrating the caisson, a greater resistance may be encountered at a large depth. During the process of suction-assisted penetration (SP), all the soil displaced by the caisson wall flows inwards, and even more volume of soil would enter into the caisson before the reverse bearing failure at the caisson tip occurs. This phenomenon would result in a larger soil heave, which makes the final insertion depth of the suction caisson less than the target depth. Although plug failure occurs during the SP process it is possible to install the caisson further, and the inverse bearing capacity failure could be progressive. The test result illustrates that different initial penetration depths by dead weight have little influence on final heights of soil heave inside the caisson. It is beneficial to suppress the development of soil heave by releasing the suction inside the caisson at intervals during the SP process. Adopting a new method of intermittent pumping can effectively reduce the soil heave but not increase the time for caisson installation in a soft clay seabed. © 2011.

84855789157	Seismic effects of incident P waves on an embedded foundation in poroelastic half-space	Dynamic vibrations of a circular rigid foundation, which is embedded in poroelastic soil and subjected to incident P waves, are studied by semi-analytical methods in this present work. The motion of the soil is governed by Biots dynamic poroelastic theory. A set of potentials are introduced to represent the incident waves, and the scattering waves caused by the foundation are considered based on the decomposition of the total wave field in soil. The soil along the vertical side of the foundation is assumed to be composed of series of infinitesimally thin poroelastic layers, while the soil under the foundation base is regarded as the poroelastic half-space and to be independent of the overlying soil. The interaction problem is solved by Hankel transforms. Then, combining the boundary conditions along the contact surface between the soil and the foundation and the dynamic equilibrium equation of the foundation, expressions of the vertical and rocking vibration amplitudes of the embedded foundation excited by the incident P waves are acquired. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the influences of embedded depth, foundation mass, pore water in the soil and incident angle on the vibrations of the foundation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857051936	A refined analytical model for landslide or debris flow impact on pipelines - Part II: Embedded pipelines	In deepwater, the pipeline is directly laid on the seabed without any protection, but the heavy pipelines will embed into the seabed during installation. The behavior of heavy pipeline under the impact of landslide is different from that of light pipeline because the heavy pipeline will move downwards when moving laterally under the impact of landslide. This work divides the pipeline into four segments: the first segment in the landslide zone, which is exposed to landslide drag force and nonlinear lateral soil resistance; the second one adjacent to the landslide zone, which is only externally loaded by lateral soil resistance; the third one is further away from the landslide, which is loaded by linearly increasing lateral soil resistance; the last segment is uniquely loaded by axial resistance. The governing equations of the four segments are expressed according to their different loading conditions, and an equation system is established on the basis of boundary conditions and continuity conditions. The final solution is obtained through a numerical method. The model proves to be simple and reliable. The parametric study reveals that the behaviors of heavy pipelines are different from those of the surface light ones. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84857053331	A refined analytical model for landslide or debris flow impact on pipelines. Part I: Surface pipelines	As one of the most destructive geohazards, submarine landslides pose significant risks to pipelines and seabed installations. Deepwater pipelines are often laid on the seabed without pre-trenching or cover, and especially light pipelines are often laid on the surface of the seabed, which makes them directly exposed to debris flows. Determining a pipeline behavior subjected to a landslide is a great challenge and still is a matter of further research. In this work, an analytical model is established to analyze the behavior of light pipeline subjected to a landslide. In this model, the pipeline is divided into four segments according to the different loading conditions along the pipeline. The governing equations of different segments are established on the basis of beam theory. Then, by virtue of the continuity conditions and boundary conditions, the explicit expressions of different segments are obtained. The influences of the drag force, slide width, the lateral and axial soil resistance are investigated through parametric studies, and some important and valuable conclusions are obtained. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84859312525	Analytical Prediction of Pipeline Behaviors in J-Lay on Plastic Seabed	J-lay is widely accepted as a favorable method for deepwater pipeline installation. The configuration and internal force of the pipeline during the laying process are key factors for its safety, and the embedment induced during pipeline installation plays an important role for pipeline stability in service. Traditionally, the seabed in the analysis of J-lay is assumed to be elastic, whereas deepwater deposits are usually very soft, exhibiting low strength and obvious plasticity. This paper presents an analytical model for pipelaying on plastic seabed. This model simplifies the pipeline as the combination of four segments: a natural catenary in water, a boundary-layer segment, a beam on the seabed (touchdown zone) where the soil deforms plastically, and a freely laid horizontal segment. The comparison with a traditional elastic-seabed model reveals that both models have similar pipeline configurations, although the elastic-seabed model slightly underestimates the maximum bending moment. In contrast, the pipeline embedment depths in the two models differ with deeper ultimate penetration predicted in the plastic-seabed model. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

84859970627	Analytical analysis of pipeline-soil interaction during J-lay on a plastic seabed with bearing resistance proportional to depth	The pipe-soil interaction at the touchdown zone (TDZ) during pipeline installation is of great importance as the pipe embedment has significant influence on various aspects of the performance of the pipeline. Most of the published works focus on the pipe-soil interaction at a pipe segment of unit length ignoring the lay effects, or simplify the seabed as a series of springs. Deepwater deposits are usually very soft, exhibiting low strength and plasticity. This paper aims to reveal the pipe-soil interaction mechanism on plastic seabed during J-lay through an analytical model. The seabed deforms plastically during loading with certain stiffness, but the stiffness during unloading is infinitely large so that the deformation of the seabed is irrecoverable. This model is established based on a system of 15 nonlinear equations and the continuity of displacement, inclination angle, bending moment and shear force along the pipeline is all guaranteed. On the basis of this model, the influences of static and dynamic laying effects on both soil resistance and pipe embedment are quantitatively studied through analytical analysis. In addition, a comparison with a model with a traditional elastic seabed is made, which reveals that the seabed model has great influence on both the inner load distribution and soil resistance along the pipeline. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84861231585	On the influence of inter-particle friction and dilatancy in granular materials: A numerical analysis	Mechanical behavior of granular soils is a classic research realm but still yet not completely understood as it can be influenced by a large number of factors, including confining pressure, soil density, loading conditions, and anisotropy of soil etc. Traditionally granular materials are macroscopically regarded as continua and their particulate and discrete nature has not been thoroughly considered although many researches indicate the macro mechanical behavior closely depends on the micro-scale characteristics of particles. This paper presents a DEM (discrete element method)-based micromechanical investigation of inter-particle friction effects on the behavior of granular materials. In this study, biaxial DEM simulations are carried out under both 'drained' and 'undrained' (constant volume) conditions. The numerical experiments employ samples having similar initial isotropic fabric and density, and the same confining pressure, but with different inter-particle friction coefficient. Test results show that the inter-particle friction has a substantial effect on the stress-strain curve, peak strength and dilatancy characteristics of the granular assembly. Clearly, it is noted that apart from the inter-particle friction, the shear resistance is also contributed to the dilation and the particle packing and arrangements. The corresponding microstructure evolutions and variations in contact properties in the particulate level are also elaborated, to interpret the origin of the different macro-scale response due to variations in the inter-particle friction. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

The point load solutions are then used to solve the dynamic problem of the vertical vibration of a rigid disc (both permeable and impermeable discs are included) on the surface of the poroelastic half-space. The contact problems are solved by integrating the point force and point pore pressure solutions over the contact area with unknown discontinuous force and pore pressure distributions, which are determined from the boundary conditions. The solutions are expressed in terms of dual integral equations, which are converted to Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and solved numerically. Selected numerical results for the vertical dynamic compliance coefficient for the cases with or without fluid overlying the poroelastic half-space are presented to show the effects of the fluid. The influence of the permeability condition of the disc on the compliance of the poroelastic half-space is investigated. The displacement, vertical stress, pore pressure in the poroelastic half-space and water pressure in the fluid half-space are also examined for different poroelastic materials and frequencies of excitation. The present results are helpful in the study of the dynamic response of foundations on the seabed under seawater. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1d and 1h displayed significantly higher activity than commercial ningnanmycin, and thus emerged as potential inhibitors of plant virus. The introduction of amino groups at the 14-position of phenanthroindolizidines, which is proposed to interact with arginine residues around the TMV RNA, increased anti-TMV activity. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84862309434	Numerical analysis of mechanical behaviors of segments of subsea shield tunnel for water intake	A three-dimensional solid model was adopted to analyze the standard segment of Sanmen nuclear power station's water intake tunnel which was staggered joint assembling per eight rings in order to analyze the different mechanical behaviors of subsea water intake tunnel's segments between construction and operation. The segments were modeled by solid elements, the bolts were modeled by beam elements, and the contact role of joints was considered. The numerical results indicated that the diameter deformation of water intake tunnel in operation was 1.5 times larger than in construction, with the maximum positive moment increasing 44.4%, the internal force of circumferential bolt rising nearly 11 times, and the splaying amount of joints soaring up to nearly 9 times. When tunnel was staggered joint assembling per eight rings, key block's location would affect the distribution of internal force of segments. During the operation period, the maximum of positive moment of crown was 2.22 times larger than the minimum. For the water intake tunnel, operation with water stress is design control load case.

84864744043	A coupled fluid layer-rigid disk-poroelastic half-space vibration problem	This paper proposes a coupled fluid layer-foundation-poroelastic half-space vibration model to study how still water affects foundations operating underwater. As an example, we consider the problem of the vertical vibration of a rigid disk on a poroelastic half-space covered by a fluid layer having a finite depth. The solution of the disk vibration problem is obtained using the boundary conditions at the free surface of the fluid layer and the boundary conditions at the fluid layer-poroelastic medium interface. The solution is expressed in terms of dual integral equations that are converted into Fredholm integral equations of the second kind and solved numerically. Selected numerical results for the vertical dynamic impedance coefficient are examined based on different water depths, poroelastic materials, disk permeabilities and frequencies of excitation. Based on the numerical results, it is proposed that the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the foundation vibration is the intrinsic reason that the existence of a fluid layer has such a great effect on the dynamic characteristics of the foundation. In many cases, the hydrodynamic pressure caused by the foundation vibration cannot be ignored when designing dynamic underwater foundations. These results are helpful in understanding the dynamic response of foundations under still water without water waves, such as foundations in pools, lakes and reservoirs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864952175	Development of discontinuous deformation analysis with displacement-dependent interface shear strength	Discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) has been widely applied in simulations of discontinuous blocky systems. The behavior of a discontinuous blocky system is mainly governed by the strength of the interface joints. The Mohr-Coulomb joint failure criterion, adopted in the original DDA, is examined through a classic case of a single block on an inclined plane. It shows that when interface cohesion exists, the block may be unstable even if the interface strength is greater than the theoretical strength required for critical stability, as the cohesion has been improperly removed. Adopting relative displacement between contacted blocks as the criterion for the removal of cohesion will provide more accurate results. The development of DDA with displacement-dependent interface shear strength is presented in this paper. To implement and illustrate the modified algorithm, two examples of progressive landslide failure simulations are performed. Both systems exhibit a two-stage failure pattern: a relatively slow, downward progressive failure stage followed by a rapid, massive run out failure stage. © 2012.

Especially, the earthquakes can cause a great bending moment and large shear force on the cross-section of casing string. An analytical model for the seismic response of subsea casing string is established on the basis of pile foundation theories and method of reverberation-ray matrix. The casing string is assumed to be a Timoshenko beam of variable cross-section.

0036873258	Research and analysis on the shape of the permanent magnet torque characteristic curve of polarized magnetic system	The best cooperation between electromagnetic attractive force (torque) characteristic and mechanical spring force (torque) characteristic is the key technique in the process of electromagnetic relay design. The shape of the attractive torque characteristic of polarized magnetic system at zero ampere-turn (i.e. the permanent magnet torque characteristic) has important influence on the shape of the electromagnetic attractive torque characteristic. In the past, it was very hard to change the shape of the permanent magnet torque characteristic and describe its concave and convex extent. Based on the unified mathematics model of the polarized magnetic system, this thesis divides the attractive torque into permanent magnet torque, polarized torque and electromagnetic torque through the energy balance formula, puts forward the concepts of shape factor and shape coefficient, adopts shape coefficient to describe the concave and convex extent of the permanent magnet torque characteristic, analyzes the influences of magnetic system parameters and pad on the shape of the permanent magnet characteristic.

By virtue of the laminated approximation method, the state equations are then transformed into the ones with constant variables in each layer, and the state variable solutions are presented. Based on the solutions, linear algebraic equations about the state variables only at the inner and outer spherical surfaces are derived by utilizing the continuity conditions at each interface. Frequency equations corresponding to two independent classes of vibrations are finally obtained from the free surface conditions. Numerical calculations are presented and the effect of the material gradient index on natural frequencies is discussed.

Failure mechanism and conservation of the ancient seawall structure along Hangzhou Bay, China. The ancient seawall along the bank of Hangzhou Bay, which plays an important role in minimizing hazards to people and property along the coastline, has existed for hundreds of years. A recent field survey reveals that there are many hidden problems in the remaining ancient heritage. This work focuses on two points: the failure mechanism of the seawall structure and the ancient mortar prescription for conservation of the seawall, which are investigated through specially designed experiments.

An analytical solution of the burst pressure for pipes with capped ends is derived, which includes the strength differential effect and takes the influence of strength criterion on the burst pressure into account. In addition, a USCbased analytical solution of the burst pressure for end-opened pipes under the internal pressure is obtained. By discussion, it is found that for the end-capped pipes, the influence of different yield criteria and the strength differential effect on the burst pressure are significant, while for the end-opened pipes, the burst pressure is independent of the specific form of the strength criterion and strength difference in tension and compression. © Shanghai University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good to excellent in vivo anti-TMV activity, of which compounds 1, 2, 15 and 16 displayed significantly higher activity than (R)-antofine and commercial Ningnanmycin at the same test condition. The substituents on the phenanthrene moiety play an important role for maintaining high in vivo antiviral activity. The introduction of 6-hydroxyl, which is proposed to interact with TMV RNA, did increased anti-TMV activity. The 14aR-configuration was confirmed to be the preferred antiviral configuration for phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids. Introduction of hydroxy group at 15-position of phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids increased activity for S-configuration but decreased activity for R-configuration.

84873595822	Synthesis and characteristics of (Hydrogenated) ferulic acid derivatives as potential antiviral agents with insecticidal activity	Background: Plant viruses cause many serious plant diseases and are currently suppressed with the simultaneous use of virucides and insecticides. The use of such materials, however, increases the amounts of pollutants in the environment. To reduce environmental contaminants, virucides with insecticidal activity is an attractive option. Results: A series of substituted ferulic acid amide derivatives 7 and the corresponding hydrogenated ferulic acid amide derivatives 13 were synthesized and evaluated for their antiviral and insecticidal activities. The majority of the synthesized compounds exhibited good levels of antiviral activity against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMW), with compounds 7a, 7b and 7d in particular providing higher levels of protective and curative activities against TMV at 500 μg/mL than the control compound ribavirin. Furthermore, these compounds displayed good insecticidal activities against insects with piercing-sucking mouthparts, which can spread plant viruses between and within crops. Conclusions: Two series of ferulic acid derivatives have been synthesized efficiently. The bioassay showed title compounds not only inhibit the plant viral infection, but also prevented the spread of plant virus by insect vectors. These findings therefore demonstrate that the ferulic acid amides represent a new template for future antiviral studies.

To analyze the phenomenon, most previous studies have modeled the pipeline as a long heavy beam resting on a rigid seabed. However, the seabed may be very soft and uneven; consequently, the pipeline may penetrate into the seabed under thermal compressive forces and change its buckling mode. This study is concerned with the effect of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling of pipelines with prop imperfection. We find that the seabed resistance exerts a remarkable influence on the phenomenon of upheaval pipeline buckling. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed splitter is based on the one-way edge mode of gyromagnetic PhC, thus can prevent scattering losses even when there are defects or obstacles in its channels. The incident electromagnetic wave can be evenly split into two output channels as long as structural symmetry is kept in a small area around the Y-junction. The loss effect of gyromagnetic material on the splitting behavior is examined. Moreover, power ratio between the two outputs can be tuned by introducing a defect at a proper position in the splitter. The advantages of the proposed splitter have been validated through numerical simulations. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

A time-harmonic Green's function for a vertical point force in a poroelastic half-space in contact with a fluid half-space is first derived. The fundamental solution is obtained using the boundary conditions at the plane passing through the point force and the boundary conditions at the poroelastic medium-fluid interface. The solution of the disc vibration problem is obtained by integrating the point force Green's function over the contact area with unknown tractions, which are determined from the boundary conditions. The solution is expressed in terms of dual integral equations that are converted into a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind and are solved numerically. Selected numerical results for the vertical dynamic compliance coefficient are examined based on different poroelastic materials, embedment depth and frequency of excitation; moreover, the results are analyzed for two different cases, namely, with or without fluid overlying the poroelastic medium to demonstrate the effect of fluid. These results are helpful in understanding the dynamic response of foundations embedded in the seabed under seawater. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The force and deformation of the large section tunnel which was lying in the sandy strata during operation period were analyzed and summarized based on field monitoring data from Qingchun-road crossing-river tunnel in Hangzhou. The effect of tidal and scour on the tunnel reinforced internal force, the interface force and tunnel settlement was analyzed. Data show accumulations of both longitudinal settlement of tunnel segments and the earth pressure distribution around the tunnel lining under the loads of both traffic and tide which result in soil disturbance in the construction period. The settlement becomes stable after about six months. However, the force on the steel bars and the deformation of the tunnel diameter remain unchanged. The substratum greatly influences on the longitudinal settlement of tunnel segments. The settlement of tunnel invert in sandy substratum is obviously affected by the tide of Qiantang River for short time, while slight changes appear in the deformation of tunnel diameter, stress of steel bar and earth pressure distribution.

84880177313	A novel efficient method to evaluate the dynamic response of laminated plates subjected to underwater shock	UNDerwater EXplosions (UNDEX) can cause severe damage to submarines, ships and offshore infrastructures as well as deep-sea fuel transfer installations, most of which are made of laminated plates and shells. A novel method involving an analytical technique and connected with the elastic dynamic response of laminated plates subjected to UNDEX is proposed here. It is based on the state space method, a numerical inversion of the Laplace transform and the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) theory formulated by Taylor. Two novel algorithms for numerically inverting the Laplace transform are also proposed, and these computations are apparently more efficient than the algorithms to be found in the related literature. The present method is validated by undertaking a comparison with a semi-analytical method and the experiment results derived from the literature written on the subject, as well as with the finite element analysis (FEA). The cooperation is deemed strong and the present method is apparently more accurate than the semi-analytical method and the FEA. The influence of the FSI is investigated in detail in a case study using both a stiff and a flexible plate. The results show that the FSI significantly influences the reaction of the laminated plate. The present solution may assist in promoting an understanding of the elastic and acoustic responses of submerged structures made of plates, and the results might be used as a benchmark solution in further research. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84885427639	Micro-scale modeling of anisotropy effects on undrained behavior of granular soils	This paper presents a micro-scale modeling of fabric anisotropy effects on the mechanical behavior of granular assembly under undrained conditions using discrete element method. The initial fabrics of the numerical samples engendered from the deposition under gravity are measured, quantified and compared, where the gravitational field can be applied in different directions to generate varying anisotropy orientations. The samples are sheared under undrained biaxial compression, and identical testing conditions are applied, with samples having nearly the same anisotropy intensities, but with different anisotropy directions. The macroscopic behaviors are discussed for the samples, such as the dilatancy characteristics and responses at the critical state. And the associated microstructure changes are further examined, in terms of the variables in the particulate scale, with the focus on the fabric evolution up to a large deformation reaching the critical state. The numerical analysis results compare reasonably well with available experimental data. It is also observed that at critical state, in addition to the requirements by classical critical state theory, a unique fabric structure has also been developed, and might be independent of its initial fabric. This observation is coincided with the recent theoretical achievement of anisotropic critical state theory. Finally, a general framework is introduced for quantifying and modeling the anisotropy effects. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Accurate analysis of riser fatigue is heavily dependent on the interaction between riser and the seabed soil, which is a research focus in recent years. This paper aims to simulate the 3D interaction between SCR and typical clay seabed through large-scale indoor tests in 1g condition. The dynamic pipe-soil interaction is modeled through applying cyclic motion at one end of the pipe. The trench formation, pipeline behavior and the excess pore water pressure beneath the pipe invert are all analyzed in detail.The apparently dynamic embedding process and the ladled shape trench at touchdown zone (TDZ) were observed, which can be attributed to soil softening. The suction at the pipe/soil interface was captured and the accumulation of excess pore pressure was visualized. The results based on this study indicate that: the excess pore water pressures at different positions along the pipe axis vary with different trends, which may be attributed to their corresponding pipe trajectories. Therefore the accurate loading history simulation is very important for conventional 2D plane strain tests. It is found that, after 200 cycles, the maximum dynamic embedment factor f

Test results indicate that the residual "active" suction after caisson installation is beneficial to its pullout capacity. Different set-up times have little influence on caisson capacity as long as the negative pore pressures around the caisson fully dissipate. When the model caisson is pulled vertically, the external side friction first reverses, and then the inner side friction is gradually mobilized at a small displacement; afterwards, the reverse end bearing resistance near the caisson tip starts to work; finally, the "passive" suction under the top cap develops and helps to keep the interior soil plug moving together with the up-lifting caisson. In general, the pullout resistance would reach its peak within a displacement less than 10% of embedded caisson length. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

Based on previously published field monitoring data and finite element analyses of ground settlements of deep excavation in soft clay, an assumed plastic deformation mechanism proposed here gives upper bound solutions for base stability of braced deep excavations. The proposed kinematic mechanism is optimized by the mobile depth (profile wavelength). The method takes into account the influence of strength anisotropy under plane strain conditions, the embedment of the retaining wall, and the locations of the struts. The current method is validated by comparison with published numerical study of braced excavations in Boston blue clay and two other cases of excavation failure in Taipei. The results show that the upper bound solutions obtained from this presented method is more accurate as compared with the conventional methods for basal heave failure analyses.

The rocks are treated as a homogeneous, isotropic, porous, elastic medium. When loaded by its own weight only, the stress distribution in the rocks surrounding pressure tunnel after excavation and water filling is studied. When the pressure tunnel is designed with the Norway rule, the minor principal stress is tensile in the vicinity of tunnel. The tensile area is like a butterfly and it will be extended with the increment of the rock slope angle. The potential hydrosplitting of rocks around pressure tunnel is taken into account and it will appear in the extended orientation of butterfly. If the thickness of tunnel overburden is increased with 1/8 of the minimum one, the tensile area will be decreased effectively. For the pressure tunnel under steep rock slope, the highest slope angle should be chosen very carefully.
