84927663004	Joint rate and power allocation for cognitive radios networks with uncertain channel gains	In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio system with multiple cognitive radio (CR) links in the same neighborhood and propose an opportunistic power control strategy for the CR links. The key feature of the proposed strategy is that, via opportunistically adjusting the CR links’ transmit power, the cognitive user can maximize its achievable transmission rate without degrading the outage probability of the primary user. Since it is difficult to track channel gains instantaneously for dynamic cognitive radio network in practice, the case where only mean channel gains averaged over short-term fading are available is considered. Under such scenarios, we derive interference constraints violation probabilities for primary user so that the interference constraints are only violated with desired limit. The achievable sum rate of the CR links under the proposed power control strategy is analyzed and simulated, taking into the impact of imperfect channel estimation. The robustness of the network system is improved with the proposed scheme.

84937512564	Spectrum leasing based on Nash Bargaining Solution in cognitive radio networks	Cognitive radio is becoming an emerging technology that has the potential of dealing with the stringent requirement and scarcity of the radio spectrum resource. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic spectrum access of cognitive radio networks, in which the primary user (PU) and secondary users (SUs) coexist. In property-rights model, the PU has property of the bandwidth and may decide to lease it to secondary network for a fraction of time in exchange for appropriate remuneration. We propose a cooperative communication-aware spectrum leasing framework, in which, PU selects SUs as cooperative relays to help transmit information, while the selected SUs have the right to decide their payment made for PU in order to obtain a proportional access time to the spectrum. Then, the spectrum leasing scheme is cast into a Nash Bargaining Problem, and the Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) can be used to fairly and efficiently address the resource allocation between PU and secondary network, enhancing both the utility of PU and secondary network. Numerical results show that spectrum leasing based on NBS is an effective method to improve performance for cognitive radio networks.

84942163735	Effect of sodium hyaluronate on nitric oxide and synovial thickness in patients with knee osteoarthritis	BACKGROUND: Intra-articular injection of sodium hyaluronate has become a preventive and complementary therapy for knee osteoarthritis that can effectively relieve pain, protect the articular cartilage, and restore the joint function. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of sodium hyaluronate on nitric oxide and synovial thickness in patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Eighty patients with knee osteoarthritis (86 knees) were randomly selected and divided into mild, moderate, severe groups. Intra-articular injection of 25 mg sodium hyaluronate was done once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. At 4 and 12 weeks after treatment, all the patients were subjected to clinical scoring according to the Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure. Thirty-seven patients (40 knees) who could make joint fluid and complete ultrasonic measurement was taken as a complete monitoring group that was also divided into three groups of mild, moderate, and severe. Levels of nitric oxide and synovial thickness were measured before and at 4 weeks after treatment. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At 4 weeks after treatment, the effective rates of mild, moderate and severe groups were 93%, 77% and 47%, respectively, and the total effective rate was 79%. At 12 weeks after treatment, the effective rates of mild, moderate and severe groups were 95%, 84% and 33%, respectively, and the total effective rate was 80%. In the complete monitoring group, the level of nitric oxide was reduced significantly in mild, moderate and severe patients at 4 weeks after treatment compared with before treatment (P < 0.05), but the synovial thickness had no difference in the mild and severe patients, and only moderate patients appeared to have thinner synovial thickness compared with before treatment (P < 0.05). Experimental findings suggest that sodium hyaluronate can reduce the level of nitric oxide and improve clinical efficacy in patients with knee osteoporosis, especially for mild and moderate knee osteoporosis patients.

In this paper, a novel routing protocols named balance energy-efficient and real-time with reliable communication (BERR) for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are proposed, which considers the joint performances of real-time, energy efficiency and reliability. In BERR, a node, which is preparing to transmit data packets to sink node, estimates the energy cost, hop count value to sink node and reliability using local information gained from neighbor nodes. BERR considers not only each sender' energy level but also that of its neighbor nodes, so that the better energy conditions a node has, the more probability it will be to be chosen as the next relay node. To enhance real-time delivery, it will choose the node with smaller hop count value to sink node as the possible relay candidate. To improve reliability, it adopts retransmission mechanism.

Disasters can be closely monitored by augmenting a variety of sensors, and WSN has merits in (1) low cost, (2) quick response, and (3) salability and flexibility. Natural disaster monitoring with WSN is a well-known data intensive application for the high bandwidth requirements and stringent delay constraints. It manifests a typical paradigm of data-intensive application upon low-cost scalable system. In this study, we first assessed representative works in this area by classifying those in the domains of application of WSNs for disasters and optimization technologies significantly distinguishing these from general-purpose WSNs. We then described the design of an early warning system for geohazards in reservoir region, which relies on the WSN technology inspired by the existing work with focuses on issues of (1) supporting reliable data transmission, (2) handling huge data of heterogeneous sources and types, and (3) minimizing energy consumption. This study proposes a dynamic routing protocol, a method for network recovery, and a method for managing mobile nodes to enable real-time and reliable data transmission. The system incorporates data fusion and reconstruction approaches to bring together all data into a single view of the geohazard under monitoring. A distributed algorithm for joint optimal control of power and rate has been developed, which can improve utility of network (> 95 %) and to minimize the energy consumption (reduction by > 20 % in comparison with LEACH). Experimental results indicate the potentials of the proposed approaches in terms of adapting to the needs of early warning on geohazards. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84890508081	Stabilization of networked control systems with actuator saturation via delta operator approach	This paper studies the problem of estimating the domain of attraction for networked control systems via delta operator approach under a pre-designed saturated linear feedback. Ellipsoids are used as the estimates of domain of attraction for delta operator systems. A condition for the networked control system is derived in terms of an auxiliary feedback matrix for determining if a given ellipsoid is contractive invariant. Linear matrix inequalities based on the methods are developed for constructing feedback laws that achieve the stability of the systems. Numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.

84890517220	Unscented Kalman filter with fading wireless channel	This paper considers the error behavior of the discrete-time unscented Kalman filter connected to the general nonlinear system via a wireless sensor. The measurements are transmitted through a noisy fading wireless channel where both transmission failure and signal fluctuation are considered. Sufficient conditions of statistical convergence property for the estimation error covariance is established. It is shown that the expected error covariance with respect to fading process is bounded and converges to a steady state value if the system satisfies some assumptions. Numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.

84894035385	Generation of minimally persistent circle formation for a multi-agent system	In this paper, two methods of generating minimally persistent circle formation are presented. The proposed methods adopt a leader-follower strategy and all followers are firstly motivated to move into the leader's interaction range. Based on the information about relative angle and relative distance, two numbering schemes are proposed to generate minimally persistent circle formation. Distributed control laws are also designed to maintain the desired relative distance between agents. The distinctive features of the proposed methods are as follows. First, only 2n - 3 unilateral communication links for n agents are needed during the circle formation process and thus the communication complexity can be reduced. In addition, the formation topology is kept fixed for the whole motion and achieves a self-stability property. Finally, each follower keeps a regualr interval with its neighbors and the formation converges to a uniform circle formation. Simulation results are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2014 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84896704964	TREE: Routing strategy with guarantee of QoS for industrial wireless sensor networks	As considerable progress has been made in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), we can expect that sensor nodes will be applied in industrial applications. Most available techniques for WSNs can be transplanted to industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs). However, there are new requirements of quality of service (QoS), that is, real-time routing, energy efficiency, and transmission reliability, which are three main performance indices of routing design for IWSNs. As one-hop neighborhood information is often inadequate to data routing in IWSNs, it is difficult to use the conventional routing methods. In the paper, we propose the routing strategy by taking the real-time routing performance, transmission reliability, and energy efficiency (TREE, triple R and double E) into considerations. For that, each sensor node should improve the capability of search range in the phase of data route discovery. Because of the increase of available information in the enlarged search range, sensor node can select more suitable relay node per hop. The real-time data routes with lower energy cost and better transmission reliability will be used in our proposed routing guideline. By comparing with other routing methods through extensive experimental results, our distributed routing proposal can guarantee the diversified QoS requirements in industrial applications.

84900479982	Distributed power control based on non-cooperative game in two-tier femtocell network	The distributed power control strategy is investigated, which works in the spectrum-sharing femtocell two-tier network. The aggregate interference threshold, which the macrocell can tolerant, is regarded as the allocated resource. The femtocell users compete with each other and purchase it. So the Stackelberg game model of the macrocell and femtocell is built, and the non-cooperative game model of femtocell users is established. Then the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in the non-cooperative game are analyzed. The distributed power adjustment algorithm is given to guide the femtocell users to compete with each other rationally in non-cooperative pattern. The simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

84899479141	Robust fuzzy-scheduling control for nonlinear systems subject to actuator saturation via delta operator approach	This paper focuses on robust fuzzy-scheduling control for nonlinear systems with actuation saturation via delta operator approach. A class of T-S fuzzy delta operator systems is extended to describe nonlinear systems subject to actuator saturation and linear fractional uncertainty. Moreover, a set invariance condition is established for T-S fuzzy delta operator systems. Based on the set invariance condition, an optimization approach is proposed to estimate the domain of attraction for the T-S fuzzy delta operator systems. The domain of attraction is arbitrarily close to a null controllable region by the designed PDC control law or non-PDC control law. Furthermore, the non-PDC control law is proposed by using fuzzy weighting-dependent Lyapunov function. The effectiveness of the developed techniques is shown through a numerical example. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84918564376	Chance-constraint optimization of power control in cognitive radio networks	In this paper, to minimize the transmission power of cognitive users in underlay cognitive radio networks, a robust power control algorithm is proposed considering the uncertain channel gains. To deal with the uncertainty, we present an opportunistic power control strategy, i.e., the outage probability of all cognitive users and primary users should be reduced below their predefined thresholds. The strategy is the joint design of primary users’ communication protection and cognitive users’ optimal power allocation. A chance constraint robust optimization approach is applied, which can transform the uncertain problem into a deterministic problem. Then, a distributed probabilistic power algorithm is introduced, which ensures the optimization of cognitive users’ power allocation based on the standard interference function and restricts the interference at primary receivers by adjusting the maximum transmission power of cognitive users. Moreover, the admission control is introduced to exploit the network resources more effectively. Numerical results show the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed robust distributed power control algorithm.

84923019286	Robust optimisation of power control for femtocell networks	In this study, the minimum transmission power of each femtocell user in a two-tier network, in which femtocells and macrocell use the spectrum simultaneously, is investigated. That is, the authors are aiming at finding the power that characterises robustness and energy-efficient when taking the uncertain gains into consideration. To solve the optimisation problem with uncertainty, an opportunistic power control strategy for the femtocells is introduced. Since the channel gain from a femtocell user to the femtocell base station is changeable with the environment, it is difficult to track channel gains instantaneously. For the reason that the mean channel gains, from the femtocell users to the femtocell base stations are usually achievable, the information of mean and probability density function are used to model the optimisation problem. Moreover, outage probability for each femtocell user's throughput is originated instead of considering the total throughput of the system, because high total throughput may not ensure that of each femtocell user. The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the macrocell is ensured by setting appreciate interference temperature. A distributed algorithm is designed to calculate the powers of femtocell users. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed outage probabilistic method and the distributed algorithm.
