84927139411	Adsorption and activation of copper ions on chalcopyrite surfaces: A new viewpoint of self-activation	The adsorption behaviors of copper ions on chalcopyrite surfaces were investigated based on zeta potential measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, copper ion adsorption experiments, first-principles calculations, and Hallimond tube cell flotation experiments. The results show that copper ions activate the chalcopyrite as a result of the interactions between copper ions and sulfur on the chalcopyrite surface. This adsorption increases the flotation rate under certain conditions, and this is beneficial for the flotation of chalcopyrite. The copper ions in the flotation pulp are mainly derived from surface oxidation dissolution and the release of fluid inclusions, and these effects enable chalcopyrite to be activated.

84861585493	The effect of mixed collectors on zinc oxide flotation	In this study, factors influencing zinc oxide flotation are investigated. These factors include the dosages of sulfidizing reagent, the pH of the regulator and the activator, the use of sodium carbonate as the pH regulator and activator, the use of copper sulfate as the activator and the use of isoamyl xanthate as the collector. All of the above factors are essential to the effective recovery of zinc oxide. Flotation using mixed collectors (isoamyl xanthogenate + dithionphosphate) showed promising results. The ratio of the mixed collectors and the addition sequence of the mixed collectors were important in attaining a true mixed collector for zinc oxide flotation. In the closed circuit experiment, these agents helped to produce a zinc concentrate with 12.41% Zn, 80.03% recovery and 17.29% Zn in the tailings. The zinc concentrate with 12.41% Zn was used as a material for hydrometallurgy to collect zinc. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84861621287	Recovery of ultrafine copper oxide mineral with vacuum flotation	Tangdan copper oxide ore deposit, located in the northeast Yunnan province of China, is the largest independent copper oxide deposit in China. The ore from the deposit is characterized by low grade, high oxidation ratio and fine-grained dissemination, which results in the poor flotation recovery. The analysis of plant flotation data reveals that the loss of copper minerals into tailings is mainly with coarse size fraction, due to its insufficient liberation and finer size, especially for the size fraction below 10 microns, which are very difficult to be floated with conventional flotation methods. In order to improve the flotation performance of the ore, laboratory tests include Hallimond flotation and vacuum flotation were respectively conducted with pure malachite, the dominant copper oxide mineral in the deposit; and the results indicate that a finer grinding fineness up to -325 mesh even -400 mesh is required to decrease the copper loss in the coarse size fraction, and vacuum flotation provides a promising way for the recovery of ultrafine malachites. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84861623227	Sulfur content reduction and iron grade improvement of V-Ti magnetite concentrate by combining reverse flotation and magnetic separation	For low-grade iron ore, smelting costs and resource wastage will be increased. Product quality of such ore is affected adversely by an excessive amount of sulfur. This also causes environmental pollution. In accordance with the vanadium-titanium (V-Ti) magnetite concentrate properties with low iron grade and high sulfur content, the joint process of magnetic separation and flotation was carried out. Magnetic separation was conducted to increase the iron grade, while reverse flotation was used to reduce sulfur content. Results show that the feeding mainly contains titanomagnetite, hematite, and pyrite. The sulfur was primarily found in pyrite. The separation effect was influenced by the grinding fineness, magnetic intensity, collector type and dosage, and pH value. At a grinding fineness of-45 μm accounting for 87%, most of the iron minerals exhibited monomer dissociation. An open-circuit experiment was carried out under the best conditions of magnetic intensity, as well as collector and modifier dosage. Good experimental results were obtained as follows: the iron grade increased to 57.17%, iron recovery was 89.94%, sulfur content decreased from 0.66% to 0.26%, reverse flotation of sulfur foam concentrate contained almost 15.68% sulfur, the upgrade ratio was about 23, and the cobalt in the sulfur concentrate was enriched 20-fold.

84861636243	Sulfidisation promotion effect of ammonium sulfate on flotation of copper oxide ore	This paper presents the sulfidisation promotion effect of ammonium sulfate on the sulfidisation flotation of both malachite and copper oxide ores. Copper oxide ores are commonly difficult-to-float due to its molecular structure, and adding sodium sulfide as activator is necessary; however, its dosage to the flotation pulp must be strictly controlled, as it is also a powerful depressant for copper sulfide minerals, and will, if in excess, depress the activated copper oxide minerals. This depression will be alleviated while ammonium sulfate is added, as it accelerates the speed of sulfidisation, and alleviates excessive sulfide ions on the depression of copper oxide minerals. Ammonium sulfate, therefore, may be a sulfidisation promoter, and plays a role of sulfidisation promotion effect; it makes the coating of sodium sulfide on the ore surface more dense and stable, which is ready for xanthate adsorption on the surface of copper oxide minerals. The results of experiments show that the flotation recovery is increased 12.28% while ammonium sulfate is added in the presence of excessive sodium sulfide in the pulp, and the highest recovery is obtainable when the ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfide are in the same dosages. The sulfidisation promotion effect of ammonium sulfate is confirmed by pure copper oxide mineral flotation test and copper oxide ores flotation test, as well as by SEM images of floated malachite. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

77955611824	Performance of a full-scale continuous centrifugal concentrator in reconcentrating fine hematite from tailings	The study aimed to evaluate the separation performance of a full-scale continuous centrifugal concentrator in the reconcentration of fine hematite from high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) concentrate in a tailings recovery plant, and to investigate the usefulness of the technology in industrial applications. The effect of changing the operating variables on concentrate grade and recovery was studied. The results indicate that among the variables considered in the study (water spray pressure, centrifugal acceleration, feed volume flow rate, feed percent solids and the reciprocation and spacing of water sprays), the change in centrifugal acceleration affects the recovery the most and continuous concentration can be achieved only when the water spray has a sufficient pressure. In addition, the reciprocation and spacing of the water sprays have a significant influence on the concentrate grade. Although performance of the full-scale concentrator is slightly inferior to pilot-scale trials, due to limitations in the scale-up design and the fluctuations of feed material characteristics, this concentrator provides a potential way to achieve continuous concentration and obtain a high-grade concentrate from tailings.

The hydrochloric acid concentration has an important effect on the dissolution of chalcopyrite. The results indicate that stirring speed has a negligible effect on copper dissolution, suggesting that the reaction is not controlled by liquid phase diffusion. Chalcopyrite leaching is also affected by temperature. X-ray diffraction studies show that sulphide is oxidised to sulphate at temperatures less than or equal to 65°C, and at 85°C, it is oxidised to elemental sulphur during the leaching process.

A typically low-grade titanium sand was first ground and then processed by low-intensity magnetic separation (LMS) and high gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) to recover titanomagnetite and ilmenite, respectively; as the TiO2 grade of the sand is low, the primary treatment of the sand by magnetic separations is effective, with 78.45% by mass weight of the sand discarded as tailings. The primary titanomagnetite concentrate was further ground and liberated to obtain a high-grade titanomagnetite concentrate through LMS reconcentration; the primary ilmenite concentrate was separated with spirals to remove the sterile limonite and magnetic gangues, and its concentrate was ground and liberated to achieve a high-grade ilmenite concentrate through HGMS refining. This novel process achieved an effective processing of the sand and obtained a high-grade ilmenite concentrate assaying 46.30% TiO2 with a high recovery of 57.88%, and a by-product of titanomagnetite concentrate assaying as high as 54.17% Fe. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

The experiments show that the flotation recovery can be increased up to 12.28 percentage points when ammonium sulfate is added in the presence of excessive sodium sulfide in the pulp, and the optimum recovery will be obtained when the ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfide are in the same dosage. The sulfidisation promotion effect of ammonium sulfate is confirmed by not only pure copper oxide mineral flotation but also copper oxide ores flotation, as well as confirmed by serial SEM images of floated malachite.

84874688260	Determination of the concentrations of calcium and magnesium released from fluid inclusions of sphalerite and quartz	This study investigates the morphology of fluid inclusions trapped within a natural sphalerite and its closely intergrown quartz, and determines the total concentrations of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) released from the inclusions after grinding. The results indicated that numerous fluid inclusions with sizes from few microns to dozens of microns exist in the sphalerite and quartz. The inclusions contain abundant Ca and Mg. However, the concentrations of Ca and Mg in the inclusions of quartz are significantly lower than those of sphalerite. The inclusions were broken during the grinding process, releasing Ca and Mg to the solution; these released concentrations increased with the increase of grinding time. The maximum concentrations of Ca and Mg released from the fluid inclusions were 61.19 ppm and 5.23 ppm for sphalerite, and 3.28 ppm and 0.21 ppm for quartz, respectively. This study provides new understanding for the source of Ca and Mg in flotation pulp. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84876019456	Theory analysis and vestigial information of surface relaxation of natural chalcopyrite mineral crystal	X-ray diffraction was used to measure the unit cell parameters of chalcopyrite crystal. The results showed that the chalcopyrite crystal is perfect, and the arrangement of its atoms is regular. A qualitative analysis of molecular mechanics showed that surface relaxation causes the chalcopyrite surface to be sulfur enriched. Atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to obtain both a microscopic three-dimensional topological map of chalcopyrite surface and a two-dimensional topological map of its electron cloud. The AFM results revealed that the horizontal and longitudinal arrangements of atoms on the chalcopyrite surface change dramatically compared with those in the interior of the crystal. Longitudinal shifts occur among the copper, iron and sulfur atoms relative to their original positions, namely, surface relaxation occurs, causing sulfur atoms to appear on the outermost surface. Horizontally, AFM spectrum showed that the interatomic distance is irregular and that a reconstruction occurs on the surface. One result of this reconstruction is that two or more atoms can be positioned sufficiently close so as to form atomic aggregates. The lattice properties of these models were calculated based on DFT theory and compared with the experimental results and those of previous theoretical works. On analyzing the results, the atomic arrangement on the (001) surface of chalcopyrite is observed to become irregular, S atoms move outward along the Z-axis, and the lengths of Cu - S and Fe - S bonds are enlarged after geometry optimization because of the surface relaxation and reconstruction. The sulfur-rich surface and irregular atomic aggregates caused by the surface relaxation and reconstruction greatly influence the bulk flotation properties of chalcopyrite. © 2013 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

84877910700	Iron concentrate synthesised from waste ferrous sulfate produced in titanium white preparation	The titanium ore in Pan Zhi-hua deposit in China contains more calcium oxide and magnesium oxide residues. So it is not suitable to be used to produce titanium white by chlorination method, but it is suitable by sulfuric acid leaching. Iron in ilmenite becomes ferrous sulfate when titanium white is produced by sulfuric acid leaching. Three to four tons of ferrous sulfates will be obtained when every ton of titanium white is produced. But the byproduct ferrous sulfate can't be effectively reused, which pollutes environment seriously. Therefore, effective utilisation of the byproduct becomes a major concern for Pan Zhi-hua mine. The experiment result shows that the iron concentration containing 65 per cent iron can be obtained by using byproduct ferrous sulfate as raw material, through dewatering of ferrous sulfate under the moderate temperature of 300°C - 400°C and pyrolysis under the high temperature of 1000°C. The density of sulfur dioxide in the gas produced by hightemperature pyrolysis ferrous sulfate is over eight per cent, so the density meets the standard of making sulfuric acid. Because sulfuric acid and iron concentrate in Pan Zhi-hua Steel and Iron Corporation can be fully utilised, the highly efficient utilisation of the byproduct ferrous sulfate can be realised and the environmental pollution will be solved successfully. © (2010) by the Australasian Institute for Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM).

84879482383	Zn release from fluid inclusions in a natural sphalerite	The type, size, and compositions of fluid inclusions in a natural sphalerite were investigated and the total concentration of Zn released from the fluid inclusions was measured. To compare the total concentration of Zn released from the fluid inclusions with that dissolved from the sphalerite itself, dissolution experiments and theoretical calculations for the dissolution equilibrium of the sphalerite were also performed. The results indicate that large numbers of fluid inclusions with various sizes exist in the sphalerite, which can be divided into four types, i.e., pure gaseous inclusions, pure liquid inclusions, gas-liquid inclusions, and gas-liquid inclusions containing solid minerals. These inclusions were broken open during the grinding process, and their compositions were released to the solution. The total concentration of Zn released from these inclusions reaches 18.35×10

84880453642	Exploiting the influence of oxidization on ultra-fine copper and nickel sulfide containing Pt-Pd in Yunnan Mine	It is known that oxidation is one of the most common ways for penlandite to be introducted into tailing during traditional coarse-particle sulfide flotation. However, it could become much more complicated and challenging problems for the low-grade, fine-disseminated Cu-Ni sulfides containing Pt and Pd in Yunnan Mine, accompanied with more than 75% of the content of MgO in the ore sample is. Direct flotation tests had been conducted to extract the metallic values as much as possible by adding traditional depressants and collectors, such as carboxylmethyl cellulose, starch, sodium silicate, butyl xanthate, (BX), butyl ammonium dithophosphate (BA) and etc., the relatively satisfied recoveries of Cu, Ni, Pt and Pd in the concentrate from bench flotation tests were obtained, however, more than 30% of metallic values still lost in the slime. In this study, bench flotation tests for the ore sample fromYunnan Mine, micro-flotation tests of serpentines and pentlandite from Jinchuan Mine and their settling rate tests were conducted to figure out how the oxidation influence the recovery of the ultra-fine nickel sulfide. All the tests results pointed to the presence of over-oxidation on the ultra-fine nickel sulfide surface and lead to the loss of Ni containing Pt and Pd in the slime tailing. Some methods which tried to slow the speed of oxidation on mineral surface during grinding and flotation were introduced in order to recover the values before over-oxidation of sulfides; however, the slime coating of serpentines also may play an important role in disturbing the floatability of ultra-fine sulfide. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The structures, forms, and phases of these large quantities of fluid inclusions were also studied. A mass of fluid inclusions with various sizes, distributions, shapes, and phases exist in bornite and its associated minerals. Their sizes vary from a few micrometers to tens of micrometers, and the forms appear as negative crystals, or elongated, elliptical, and irregular. At room temperature, fluid inclusions were mainly characterized as gas-liquid twophase. However, small amounts of fluid inclusions with pure gas phase and pure liquid single-phase were also observed in quartz and calcite. These fluid inclusions initially broke during the ore crushing and grinding process and then released into the flotation pulp in the flotation process. The quantitative analysis of fluid inclusions in the solution and the comparisons of mineral dissolution show that the amount of copper and iron released by fluid inclusions in the bornite sample is higher than the amount dissolved by the mineral; fluid inclusions in the associated gangue minerals, quartz, and calcite also make contribution. © 2013 University of Science and Technology Beijing and Springer-Verlag.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of beneficiating a low-grade, hematite-magnetite ore (assaying 18.64% Fe) for subsequent utilization. In this study, process mineralogy and beneficiation of the ore were carried out in the laboratory. First, mineralogical investigation shows that the main metal minerals are hematite, magnetite and a little octahedrite that cannot be used at present, and the main gangue minerals include albite, quartz and ankerite. Based on the above, a combined process of magnetic separation and gravity concentration has been developed by using laboratory low- and high-intensity magnetic separators and a slimes shaking table, respectively. Factors affecting these separation methods are discussed, including process mineralogy on the tailings of the high-intensity separator, where the iron minerals were found to be finely disseminated in the gangue as inclusions. By applying a two-stage grinding step and a magnetic separation stage together with gravity concentration, a marketable iron concentrate assaying 60.79% Fe at a recovery of 60.23% can be obtained, when the feed assays 18.75%Fe, which provides some useful information for the sustainable use of low-grade iron ore.

The results indicated that the iron phase in the raw ore was predominantly metallic iron with an iron particle size below 30 μm, and the phosphorus compound was apatite. By applying MFS to siderite reductive ore containing 37.14% Fe and 0.52 P, a concentrate assaying 66.37% Fe and 0.19 P with 74.32% recovery was produced. The iron recovery increased by 5.77% compared with the results of the conventional magnetic separation. The high efficiency in phosphorus removal and iron recovery achieved by the MFS process may be attributed to the adequate liberation of iron particles and the increase in magnetic force on the iron mineral fines in the form of flocs in a magnetic field. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
