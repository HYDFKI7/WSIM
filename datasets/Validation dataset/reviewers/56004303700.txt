16344386771	cDNA cloning and sequence analysis of growth hormone receptor (GHR) from giant panda	The gene encoding giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) growth hormone receptor (GHR) was amplified by RT-PCR from the liver total RNA. Cloned into pGEM®-T vector, the PCR product was sequenced and analyzed subsequently. The results indicated that the open reading frame (ORF) of giant panda GHR is 1917 bp, which encodes a 638 amino acid precursor containing a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and a mature peptide of 620 amino acid. Mature GHR of giant panda possesses similar GHR architectural structure from human, dog, and pig, all including a 246 amino acids extracellular domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region of 24 amino acid followed by a 350 amino acid cytoplasmic region, and all conserved landmarks of GHR were also found in giant panda GHR from sequence alignment. Sequence analysis revealed a fairly high similarity between giant panda GHR and GHR from mammals ranging from 69% to 93%, and a medium level similarity of 60% with the birds and reptiles. But the amino acid similarity decreases to only 30% for fish species. Despite the great similarity, giant panda GHR has its own specificity in the amino acid compared to GHR from other mammals, suggesting possible difference on biological function.

20444427272	A study of the behavior of female giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) following mating	We studied behavioral indicators of pregnancy for 8 adult female giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding following 20 mating events, 1999-2002. All data were collected between the hours of 14: 00 and 17: 00 between June and November, each female was observed for one hour during this period each day. All 8 females were in good health and had mated, either naturally or artificially. Four scenarios were observed: 1. behavioral indicators of pregnancy were strong; 2. behavioral indicators of pregnancy were weak; 3. the female demonstrated a pseudo-pregnancy; and 4. no behavioral response was observed. We conclude that strong behavioral responses which included a reduction in appetite or a stoppage of eating about 27 days before delivery, were common for pandas that delivered successfully. The percentage time spent resting was over 91 %. Noticeable antenatal responses and vulvae changes were also observed; Weak behavioral indicators of pregnancy were rare for some pandas which also gave birth. One indicator was a slight reduction in appetite, however, the percent of time spent resting did not change, and there were no obvious antenatal responses or vulvae changes. Behaviors of pseudo-pregnancy and real pregnancy were similar, with fluctuating ingestion of food. Appetite, amount of activity and vulvae appearance gradually returned to normal. Some pandas demonstrated no behavioral response or corresponding behaviors after mating.

0032079731	In vitro maturation of follicular oocytes of the Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca): A case report	The Giant Panda is an endangered species that would benefit from biotechnological assistance in reproduction. However, because there are only a few of these animals left in the world, scientists hesitate to use them for research procedures. We were fortunate to obtain ovaries from a Giant Panda that died of hepatic cirrhosis during the nonbreeding season. Oocytes were harvested within 4 h of death by dissecting the ovarian cortex in physiological saline and collecting the cumulus-oocyte complexes from the fluid, and then were classified into large (>125 μm) and small (100 to 124 μm) follicular oocytes and placed in TCM199 supplemented with FSH (10 μg/mL) and LH (20 μg/mL).

27844444347	Molecular cloning of giant panda pituitary prolactin cDNA and its expression in Escherichia coli	cDNA encoding pituitary (PRL) of giant panda was obtained using RT-PCR and expressed in E. coli. The results revealed that panda PRL cDNA encodes a precursor protein of 229 amino acids including a putative signal peptide of 30 amino acids and a mature protein of 199 residues with one potential N-glycosylation site. Sequence comparison indicated that panda PRL shares a high degree of identity to other known PRL sequences ranging from 98% with mink PRL to about 50% with rodent PRL. Six cysteine residues and 29 conserved residues distributed in four domains (PD1, PD2, PD3, and PD4) of PRL were observed through multiple sequence alignment. Fourteen key residues of binding sites 1 and 2 involved in receptor binding are conserved in panda PRL. GST fused recombinant panda PRL protein was efficiently expressed with the form of insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 transformed with a pGEX-4T-1 expression vector containing the DNA sequence encoding mature panda PRL. Western blot analysis indicated that GST-panda PRL recombinant protein could be recognized by antibody against human PRL. Our results would contribute to further elucidating the structural and functional characteristics of pituitary PRL and provide a basis for the production of recombinant panda prolactin for future use in the breeding of giant panda.

30144431848	Successful rearing of twins by a female giant panda in captivity	It is very difficult for the female giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) to simultaneously take care of twins in captivity. In 2003, MeiMei, who was sent to Japan for an international collaborative study, became the first female giant panda to successfully raise both of her twins. This article describes the successful mother - rearing of both infants. The main factors that contributed to this success were 1) MeiMei had a strong maternal instinct, and prolific experience to have reared her babies, these were very important for her to simultaneously take care of her twins, 2) adequate maternal nutrition, and a suitable rearing environment and 3) humans assistance. In addition, we compared the daily growth of the twins to the growth of MeiMei' s cubs from 2000 and 2001. We discuss the implications this data has on rearing twins in captivity and how it can be used to increase twins survival rate in captivity.

Two haplotypes (haplotype I and haplotype II) were identified and the captive population had a bias towards haplotype I. This subspecies as a whole demonstrated an extremely low level of genetic diversity with the nucleotide diversity of 0.057 ± 0.021%. The mtDNA ND5 variations detected in the present study could provide significant information to the studbook data of the South China tiger. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

33744775040	Preliminary observations on mucous excretion in the giant panda	462 episodes of mucous excretion and associated behavioral changes were documented for 25 giant pandas that were at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. The purpose of this preliminary study was to lay the foundation for understanding the phenomenon of mucous production, and to investigate measures which may be related the frequency of mucous excretion. Indicators included the period of abdominal discomfort associated with mucous excretion (mean = 2.5 ± 2.3 h); the interval from first refusal to consume bamboo and concentrated feed until mucous excretion episode (mean 1.8 ± 2.2 h); the interval from first refusal until return of appetite (mean = 1.9 ± 2.3 h); the interval from mucous excretion until intake of concentrated feed and bamboo (means = 29.8 ± 94.7 min and 33.8 ± 105.8 min, respectively); the interval between mucous excretion episodes (mean = 18.9 ± 24.0 days); mucous characteristics and weight of mucous averaged 1.7 ± 0.7 and 77.8 ± 47.7 g, respectively. Results indicated that the phenomenon of mucus excretion in the giant panda causes significant disruption to daily activity patterns. Animals that excreted mucous more frequently (15 days or less, between bouts) showed significantly more lethargy (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), abdominal discomfort (P < 0.05), length of time of refusal to eat bamboo (P < 0.055), and higher mucous weight, than animals that excreted mucous less frequently. Higher frequency of mucous excretion was directly associated with inhibited growth, reproduction and health status in the giant pandas studied.

33747838804	Cloning, characterization and tissue specific expression of Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) IGF-I	Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) plays an important role in regulating gonad function, which is essential for normal reproduction in animals, especially in sexual receptivity and reproductive behavior. In this study, a cDNA encoding Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) IGF-I was isolated from liver total RNA using RT-PCR. The IGF-I cDNA of Amur tiger (ATIGF-I) was highly homologous to that of other animals, 84.8% to rat, 93.7% to human and horse. Alignment analysis showed that the cysteine residues and many amino acid residues of putative mature ATIGF-I are highly conserved in mammalian species, confirming the high sequence homology observed in other species. DNA encoding the mature ATIGF-I peptide was ligated with pET-DsbA expression vector and highly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 with IPTG induction. The recombinant proteins expressed existed mostly in the soluble protein fraction, and were purified with metal affinity resins. Western blotting confirmed that the recombinant proteins reacted with antibodies against IGF-I. The results obtained here should be useful for large-scale production of biological active ATIGF-I protein, as well as for further research on growth, development, and reproduction in the Amur tiger. Tissue specific expression of ATIGF-I mRNA in the Amur tiger was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), The major ATIGF-I mRNA expression tissue was the liver, while medium signals were found in the uterus, ovary, and pituitary, and minor signals were detected in various tissues including the heart, spleen, pancreas, and kidney. The results indicate that IGF-I might play an important role in the reproductive system and in cub development in the Amur tiger.

33750503201	Highly conserved D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequences (Numts) in tiger (Panthera tigris)	Using oligonucleotide primers designed to match hypervariable segments I (HVS-1) of Panthera tigris mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we amplified two different PCR products (500 bp and 287 bp) in the tiger (Panthera tigris), but got only one PCR product (287 bp) in the leopard (Panthera pardus). Sequence analyses indicated that the sequence of 287 bp was a D-loop-like nuclear mitochondrial sequence (Numts), indicating a nuclear transfer that occurred approximately 4.8-17 million years ago in the tiger and 4.6-16 million years ago in the leopard. Although the mtDNA D-loop sequence has a rapid rate of evolution, the 287-bp Numts are highly conserved; they are nearly identical in tiger subspecies and only 1.742% different between tiger and leopard. Thus, such sequences represent molecular 'fossils' that can shed light on evolution of the mitochondrial genome and may be the most appropriate outgroup for phylogenetic analysis. This is also proved by comparing the phylogenetic trees reconstructed using the D-loop sequence of snow leopard and the 287-bp Numts as outgroup. © Indian Academy of Sciences.

34248541047	Cloning, expression and tissue distribution of IGF-1 from giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a potypeptide that regulate growth, differentiation and muscle regeneration in several species. This study was designed to analyse the cDNA sequence of IGF-1 in giant panda, its gene expression and tissue distributions in relation to growth, development and reproduction of captive giant pandas. A cDNA encoding IGF-1 was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR from a male giant panda cub liver tissue. Sequence alignment analysis showed the cysteine residues and other amino acid residues of the mature IGF-1 peptide of giant panda are highly conserved in mammalian species. DNA encoding the mature IGF-1 peptide of the giant panda was ligated with pETDsbA expression vector and expressed in E. coli BL21. Western blot confirmed the IGF-1 antigen activity of the recombinant protein. By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis it is demonstrated that the IGF-1 mRNA distribution abundance were significantly higher in the liver, muscles and heart than those in the other tissues studied. However, the IGF-1 peptide distribution abundances in all the tissues studied did not show any significant differences. The localization of the IGF-1 peptide was in accordance with that of mRNA for each tissue. These results may suggest that IGF-1 play an autocrine orparacrine rôle in regulation of the giant panda growth and development. © 2006 British Society of Animal Science.

34250835861	The complete mitochondrial genome and phylogenetic analysis of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, was determined by the long and accurate polymerase chain reaction (LA-PCR) with conserved primers and primer walking sequence methods. The complete mitochondrial DNA is 16,805 nucleotides in length and contains two ribosomal RNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one control region. The total length of the 13 protein-coding genes is longer than the American black bear, brown bear and polar bear by 3 amino acids at the end of ND5 gene. The codon usage also followed the typical vertebrate pattern except for an unusual ATT start codon, which initiates the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene. The molecular phylogenetic analysis was performed on the sequences of 12 concatenated heavy-strand encoded protein-coding genes, and suggested that the giant panda is most closely related to bears. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Among these microsatellite loci, one locus was monomorphic; among the remaining 10 loci, the number of observed alleles for each locus in 57 individual tigers ranged from four to nine, the expected and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.366 to 0.805 and 0.400 to 0.837, respectively, and the mean polymorphic information content (PIC) was 0.609. Moreover, two loci (F41 and FCA391) were compared between the domestic cat and the south China tiger and differences in their flanking regions were found (5.9% for F41 and 4.8% for FCA391). These 10 polymorphic tri- and tetra-nucleotide microsatellite markers would be very useful in the evaluation of tiger population structure and the genetic relationships among the individual tigers. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

37849009385	Serosurvey of ex situ giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) in China with implications for species conservation	Conservation strategies for the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) include the development of a self-sustaining ex situ population. This study examined the potential significance of infectious pathogens in giant pandas ex situ. Serologic antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus (CAV), canine coronavirus (CCV), canine herpesvirus, canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, and Leptospira interrogans were measured in 44 samples taken from 19 giant pandas between 1998 and 2003 at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Sichuan, China. Seroassays also included samples obtained in 2003 from eight red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) housed at the same institution. All individuals had been vaccinated with a Chinese canine vaccine that included modified live CDV, CPV, CAV, CCV, and CPIV. Positive antibody titers were found only against CDV, CPV, and T. gondii. Sera were negative for antibodies against the other six pathogens. Results indicate that the quality of the vaccine may not be reliable and that it should not be considered protective or safe in giant pandas and red pandas. Positive antibody titers against T. gondii were found in seven of the 19 giant pandas. The clinical, subclinical, or epidemiologic significance of infection with these pathogens via natural exposure or from modified live vaccines in giant pandas is unknown. Research in this area is imperative to sustaining a viable population of giant pandas and other endangered species. Copyright 2007 by American Association of Zoo Veterinarians.

79951916005	Studies on genetic diversity of captive Giant Pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) based on microsatellite DNA markers	34 captive Giant Pandas (captive population: including a population and b population) and 7 captive wild Giant Pandas (captive wild population) are study objects. Their blood samples are got from Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda. 30 microsatellite DNA markers including AY161177∼AY161218, Ame-μ5∼Ame- μ70 and g001∼g905 are used to investigate the actual state of genetic diversity within and between samples. Meanwhile, the measures how to maintenance and improve genetic diversity of Giant Pandas are discussed. The information for microsatellite locus showed that 30 microsatellite DNA markers were polymorphic (PIC=0.621∼0.640) and the genetic diversity of 41 captive Giant Pandas was higher (a population: A=5.48, Ho=0.475, He=0.690; b population: A=5.24, Ho=0.453, He=0.719; captive wild population: A =3.80, Ho=0.514, He=0.725) than that of other 6 endangered species(Ho=0.210∼0.390, He=0.150∼0.430), but was lower than that of 3 non-endangered species. 41 captive Giant Pandas maintenanced high genetic diversity. However, compared to 7 captive wild Giant Pandas, the genetic diversity of 34 captive Giant Pandas degraded. The date of F-statistics and gene flow (of 25 microsatellite locus Nm=2.610, Fst=0.0874, Fit= 0.4116) indicated that a population and b population exchanged individuals resulting to inbreeding. There was a low level of genetic variabilities between a population and b population. The inbreeding level of b population was higher than that of a population (a population: Fis=0.3221, b population: Fis=0.3983). Therefore, at the present, the focus of management of captive Giant Panda should shift to avoiding the inbreeding and the loss of genetic diversity. The captive populations of Giant Panda should be in the same management unit. Retrieving pedigree and chosing the fittest exchange individual are the key point. Microsatellite technologey is the key way to protect and improve genetic diversity of captive Giant Pandas.

80052498921	Analysis of variable sites between two complete South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis) mitochondrial genomes	In order to investigate the mitochondrial genome of Panthera tigris amoyensis, two South China tigers (P25 and P27) were analyzed following 15 cymt-specific primer sets. The entire mtDNA sequence was found to be 16,957 bp and 17,001 bp long for P25 and P27 respectively, and this difference in length between P25 and P27 occurred in the number of tandem repeats in the RS-3 segment of the control region. The structural characteristics of complete P. t. amoyensis mitochondrial genomes were also highly similar to those of P. uncia. Additionally, the rate of point mutation was only 0.3% and a total of 59 variable sites between P25 and P27 were found. Out of the 59 variable sites, 6 were located in 6 different tRNA genes, 6 in the 2 rRNA genes, 7 in non-coding regions (one located between tRNA-Asn and tRNA-Tyr and six in the D-loop), and 40 in 10 protein-coding genes. COI held the largest amount of variable sites (9 sites) and Cytb contained the highest variable rate (0.7%) in the complete sequences. Moreover, out of the 40 variable sites located in 10 protein-coding genes, 12 sites were nonsynonymous. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.286-0.971 and 0.443-0.894, and the mean polymorphic information content was 0.712. All loci followed Hardy-Weinberg expectations except Aifu-14 and Aifu-16, which may due to the presence of inbreeding or null alleles. Three pairs of loci exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.

In this study, the mature peptide of A. melanoleuca growth hormone (AmGH) was successfully expressed and secreted in Pichia pastoris under the control of AOX1 promoter. The expression condition for AmGH in P. pastoris, such as the expression time, pH value and methanol concentration in the BMMY were optimized and the AmGH expression level is about 100 mg/L using GS115 recombinant under optimized condition (96 h of 1.5% methanol induction). The secreted nascent AmGH were purified using ammonium sulfate fractionation. The mature AmGH protein exhibited a molecular mass of approximately 22 kDa on SDS-PAGE. This study would provide a new opportunity for large-scale expression and purification of AmGH, which might facilitate studies on the biological activity of AmGH. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

60249085156	A new method for DNA extraction from feces and hair shafts of the South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis)	It is commonly known that tigers (Panthera tigris) groom themselves by licking their coats, which leads to an abundance of hairs in their feces. These hairs are designated specially as "fecal hairs". In our study, in order to explore fecal hairs potential as a DNA source for genetic analysis, 55 fecal hair samples were collected from 23 captive South China tigers (P. t. amoyensis). According to the amplification of mitochondrial primers loop F and loop R, DNA quality of noninvasive samples were grouped into three grades: grade I - the highest-quality DNA, grade II - high-quality DNA, and grade III - poor-quality DNA. No failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and only 0.27% genotyping errors occurred with grade I fecal hair DNA, as compared with 9.4% failed amplifications on microsatellite primers and 9.5% genotyping errors with grade II fecal hair DNA. It was found that 25.45% of fecal hair DNA was grade I and 65.45 and 10.00% of fecal hair DNA were grades II and III, respectively, as compared with 4.35% grade I fecal DNA and 34.78 and 60.87% grades II and III fecal DNA, respectively. Thus, higher-quality DNA can be extracted from fecal hairs than feces. In addition, DNA could be extracted from hair shafts of tigers and a minimum of 2000 hair shafts were required for visible DNA bands on a 1% agarose gel. These findings demonstrate that fecal hairs may serve as a convenient and reliable genomic DNA source for genotype analysis. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

61649098005	Microsatellite variability reveals the necessity for genetic input from wild giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) into the captive population	Recent success in breeding giant pandas in captivity has encouraged panda conservationists to believe that the ex situ population is ready to serve as a source for supporting the wild population. In this study, we used 11 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the amount and distribution of genetic variability present in the two largest captive populations (Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan Province and the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda at Wolong, Sichuan Province). The data were compared with those samples from wild pandas living in two key giant panda nature reserves (Baoxing Nature Reserve and Wanglang Nature Reserve). The results show that the captive populations have retained lower levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity compared to isolated wild populations. However, low inbreeding coefficients indicate that captive populations are under careful genetic management. Excessive heterozygosity suggests that the two captive populations have experienced a genetic bottleneck, presumably caused by founder effects. Moreover, evidence of increased genetic divergence demonstrates restricted breeding options within facilities. Based on these results, we conclude that the genetic diversity in the captive populations is not optimal. Introduction of genetic materials from wild pandas and improved exchange of genetic materials among institutions will be necessary for the captive pandas to be representative of the wild populations. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

In this study the MHC class II DRB genes were investigated in the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) by using a cloning-sequencing method. Analysis in 16 individuals from typical distribution areas in China indicated a relatively high level of allelic diversity: 13 alleles with high sequence polymorphism at 46 variable sites (19.33% of the 238 nucleotides). An overall purifying selection was detected, with one strongly positively selected site located within antigen-binding sites. The main driving force that led to this allelic diversity pattern is discussed. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

A homology search performed by BLAST revealed that Bs-Ag2 shared the highest amino acid sequence identity with As16 protein from Ascaris suum (94%). The recombinant Bs-Ag2 proteins can be successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The rBs-Ag2 was used to evaluate their ability to induce immune protective responses in BALB/c mice against L3-challenge infection in a mouse-B. schroederi model. There was a 63.66% reduction (P < 0.001) of recovery of larvae compared with that in the control group. Specific anti-Bs-Ag2 antibodies from immune protected mice had significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) (P < 0.0001). Our data supported the use of Bs-Ag2 as a potential candidate for vaccination against B. schroederi infection. Crown Copyright © 2009.

75149155568	The sequence and de novo assembly of the giant panda genome	Using next-generation sequencing technology alone, we have successfully generated and assembled a draft sequence of the giant panda genome. The assembled contigs (2.25 gigabases (Gb)) cover approximately 94% of the whole genome, and the remaining gaps (0.05 Gb) seem to contain carnivore-specific repeats and tandem repeats. Comparisons with the dog and human showed that the panda genome has a lower divergence rate. The assessment of panda genes potentially underlying some of its unique traits indicated that its bamboo diet might be more dependent on its gut microbiome than its own genetic composition. We also identified more than 2.7 million heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the diploid genome. Our data and analyses provide a foundation for promoting mammalian genetic research, and demonstrate the feasibility for using next-generation sequencing technologies for accurate, cost-effective and rapid de novo assembly of large eukaryotic genomes. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

76149121515	Characterization and expression of ailuropoda melanoleuca leptin (ob gene)	Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays important roles in metabolism and reproduction. In this article, we report the cloning, expression, and identification of the giant panda leptin (gLeptin) gene and its variants. The gLeptin cDNA was 504 bp long, encoding a precursor peptide of 167 amino acids including 21 residues of signal peptide. A short variant of gLeptin was 501 bp long, encoding a 166-aa peptide and also including a 21-aa signal peptide. Giant panda leptin was 99.4%, 94.6%, and 92.8% identical to that of black bear, dog, and cat, respectively, but was only 81.4% and 80.8% identical to that of human and rat. The cloned gLeptin gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, with expression confirmed by Western blotting and MALDI-TOF-TOF MS PMF. After purification, renaturation, and condensation, the gLeptin protein was injected into Kunming mice. The recombinant gLeptin significantly inhibited food intake by 41.8% and reduced body weight by 5.1% in the mice. © 2010 Zoological Society of Japan.

77951242106	Lineage pattern, trans-species polymorphism, and selection pressure among the major lineages of feline Mhc-DRB peptide-binding region	The long-term evolution of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) involves the birth-and-death process and independent divergence of loci during episodes punctuated by natural selection. Here, we investigated the molecular signatures of natural selection at exon-2 of MHC class II DRB gene which includes a part of the peptide-binding region (PBR) in seven of eight putative extant Felidae lineages. The DRB alleles in felids can be mainly divided into five lineages. Signatures of trans-species polymorphism among major allelic lineages indicate that balancing selection has maintained the MHC polymorphism for a long evolutionary time. Analysis based on maximum likelihood models of codon substitution revealed overall purifying selection acting on the feline DRB. Sites that have undergone positive selection and those that are under divergent selective pressure among lineages were detected and found to fall within the putative PBR. This study increased our understanding of the nature of selective forces acting on DRB during feline radiation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77952091170	Serosurvey of selected viruses in captive giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China	Serum samples from 92 giant pandas in three captive facilities were tested for antibodies against five viruses of carnivores. Antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV) in two facilities in which giant pandas were vaccinated were variable. The canine adenovirus (CAV-1) and canine parvovirus (CPV) titers in vaccinated group were both positive, but titers were not high and varied among individual except one vaccinated panda had extremely high CAV-1 titer, indicating infection with the field virus following vaccination. Our results suggest that the vaccines used for these giant pandas do not elicit consistent antibody titers. Antibody titers against CDV, CPV and CAV-1 in unvaccinated giant pandas were highly variable, especially CPV titer. Almost half of sera were CPV antibody positive, and CPV titers were high enough to suggest infection with the virus. Canine coronavirus (CCV) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) titers were not detected in all serum samples. The results of this study emphasize the need for research on infectious diseases of giant pandas and development of suitable vaccines for the species. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

77952098346	Serological evaluation of the efficacy of the multivalent canine distemper attenuated live vaccines on giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	33 giant pandas consisted of different ages and sexes were vaccinated with a multivalent canine distemper attenuated live vaccines specialized for dogs according to a routine protocol. Blood samples were collected from each of the 33 individuals piror to vaccination and at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 11 months post-vaccination. Serological viral neutralization titers (VN) to CDV were determined by viral neutralization tests as well as recording the health data of all individuals throughout the vaccinal year. The results indicated: 1) No side effects related to vaccination were observed, and this type of multivalent canine distemper attenuated live vaccines was safe for use in giant pandas. 2) 13 of 33 giant pandas including old ones, adult and sub-adult ones had existing pre-vaccination VN titers (≥1:4). 3) Of the 4 old pandas, 2 produced very low level of VN titers (≤1:8) while the other 2 failed to produce post-vaccination VN titers (<1:4). 4) 9 of 15 adult giant pandas failed to produce post-vaccination VN titers, only 6 of 15 adult giant pandas produced very low level of post-vaccination VN titers (≤1:22). 5)8 of 9 sub-adult giant pandas produced very low levels of post-vaccination VN titers (≤1:22), 1 of 9 sub-adult giant pandas failed to produce VN titers (<1:4). 6) All of 5 infant pandas produced post-vaccination VN titers that peaked from a range of 2 W to 1 M post-vaccination, and both the level and duration of these VN titers in infant pandas were significant higher or longer than those in old, adult and sub-adult pandas (P<0.05). Although 1 infant one had ever produced the highest level of VN titers (1:127), all of the VN titers in 5 infant pandas had dropped dramatically (1:16) in 3 months. It was concluded that these types of multivalent attenuated canine distemper live vaccines specialized for dogs in inadequate to stimulate giant panda to produce protective VN titers against CDV using to this routine protocol.

77955654999	CDNA cloning and expression of ghrelin in giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. It plays an important role in stimulating growth hormone secretion, food intake, body weight gain and gastric motility. cDNA sequences coding for ghrelin precursor protein (prepro-ghrelin) were isolated from the stomach of a giant panda. Two different mRNA sequences of ghrelin were obtained. The long open reading frame of ghrelin (354 bp) encodes a precursor protein of 117 amino acids with a 23 amino acid signal peptide. The short one (351 bp) encodes a precursor protein of 116 amino acids with the same 23 amino acid signal peptide. The presumed giant panda mature ghrelin proteins also had two forms. Comparative analysis showed that the first and the fourth amino acids (Gly and Phe) were completely conserved and the third amino acid (Ser) was also highly conserved in the mature ghrelin. RT-PCR analysis of giant panda ghrelin mRNA in various tissues revealed high level of expression in stomach, relative lower levels of expression in small intestine, liver and kidney, and no expression in thymus, spleen and heart. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

77956153451	Development of new tetranucleotide microsatellite loci and assessment of genetic variation of giant panda in two largest giant panda captive breeding populations	The giant panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca is a critically endangered species endemic to China. In order to carry out effective genetic management for the giant panda population, sufficient and reliable polymorphic genetic markers are required to provide essential information on the genetic diversity survey of this species. Seven new tetranucleotide microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized in this study and presented here as a tool for evaluating the genetic variation of giant pandas in the world's two largest captive populations (Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, Sichuan Province and the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province). A total of 45 alleles were identified from these seven new microsatellite loci on the basis of 48 giant panda individuals, including 19 private alleles (six from the Chengdu population, 13 from the Wolong population) and 26 shared alleles. The average number of alleles, the average allelic richness the and mean observed heterozygosity were 4.6, 4.367 and 0.649, respectively in the Chengdu population and 5.6, 5.697 and 0.675 in the Wolong population, suggesting that the Chengdu population has a much lower allelic diversity than the Wolong population. Thus, we proposed a better strategy for the captive breeding of giant pandas. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 The Zoological Society of London.

77956937538	Zinc-finger intron 7: A new locus for sex identification of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	We developed a single-reaction test for identifying the sex of giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) targeted to co-amplify homologous fragments with size polymorphism that located at zinc-finger (ZF) intron 7 by using one pair of primers. This assay produced one sex-specific fragment in females (XX genotypes) whereas two fragments were produced in males (XY genotypes). Indels (insertion/ deletion) in intron 7 of Y-linked allele provide a significant discrimination between ZFX and ZFY, thus the amplification products can be simply distinguished by agarose gel electrophoresis, exhibiting sex-specific banding patterns (female, 354 bp; male, 354 bp, 135 bp). The new primer set was successfully tested on known-sex giant pandas by using template DNA extracted from both blood and fecal samples. Cross-species test was also performed, revealing that this assay could be applied to other Ursidae species. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

78751523528	DNA barcoding of 18 species of Bovidae	Genetic divergences of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I genes, known as DNA barcodes, have been used in species identification in the animal kingdom. Barcodes can assist field workers and taxonomists to determine groups in need of taxa analysis, and facilitate the recognition of appropriate populations and scales for conservation planning. In this study, 18 species of Bovidae were selected to evaluate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for species differentiation. The results showed that all but 2 species had unique DNA barcodes. The mean intraspecific variation was 0.63%, yielding a threshold of 6.3% for flagging putative species. The results supported the inference that barcode variation within species of mammals is somewhat higher than within other animal groups. The present study validated the effectiveness of barcoding for the identification of bovid species. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

79751470215	Isolation and identification of rotavirus from giant panda cubs	11 giant panda cubs (age ranged from 5 to 11 months) suffered an acute, obstinate and infectious diarrhea, 1 panda cub aged 6 months died just 4 days after the onset of clinical signs. All of the sick cubs were these animals weaned from their mothers. Their peers who were still being nursed by their mothers seemed unaffected even in the same environment. Samples from all of these sick panda cubs had been cultured for bacteria and examined for parasites, but results of these examinations were negative. In a survey performed for viral pathogens, feces from 8 of the 11 panda cubs were tested for rotavirus by an ELISA kit, most of the samples from each of the 8 cubs were positive. Fecal samples were collected for isolation of virus. Rotavirus was isolated from these samples and identified by electronic microscopy, physical and chemical characteristics, and serum neutralization test.

79751505464	Observations on a captive giant panda nursing twin cubs	Captive giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) can have 1-2 cubs per litter; twins occur in 46.4% of births. In the case of twins , it is often difficult for the mother to nurse both cubs, thus she chooses one and rejects the other. In 2003, the captive giant panda "Meimei" (Stud No. 343) successfully nursed and raised twin male cubs (Longbin and Qiubin), the first known instance of this. We noted the following behaviors during the 6-month period after birth: The mother predominantly used 2 methods to pick up the cubs: holding both cubs in her mouth, and holding one in her mouth and placing the other beside her face. During the first 60 days, she nursed predominantly in an upright seated position. Her next most frequent position was lying on her side with the head and feet in contact with each other. Other behavioral positions were infrequent. The mother' s activity level peaked on the day of birth and decreased dramatically to 35. 2 ±0. 6% over the next 46 days. At 47 - 108 days , her activity increased to 42. 2 ± 0. 6% and 109 - 180 days later, increased to 54. 8 ±0. 9% . There was no significant difference between cubs in the number of times/day the mother nursed each or the duration of each nursing session. During the first 7 days, both cubs either leaned against the mother or were held by her (behavior B) . At 7 - 10 days , behavior B began to gradually decrease while three other behaviors emerged. At 21 - 23 days, behavior B significantly decreased while the behaviors of the mother covering the cubs (behavior C) , remaining beside the cubs (behavior S) and being naturally apart from the cubs (behavior N) significantly increased. After 32 days, the time spent on behavior C decreased again; During the observation periods the time spent on behavior B, C, S, and N were not sig nificantly different between the two cubs (P > 0. 05). The mother' s activity level, number of nursing sessions, and time spent on behavior N fluctuated daily during the observation periods. As the cubs grew stronger and more active, the distance they traveled away from the nest increased. This distance differered between the two cubs. The mother spent more time interacting with Longbin than with Qiubin. There was no difference between the 2 cubs in the amount of time spent playing by themselves. The amount of time the cubs spend playing with each other plus the time by themselves was greater than time spent with the mother. This research helped gain a new perspective on the giant pandas maternal behavior and also on the nursing and raising behavior of giant panda twin cubs.

79952614076	Successful rearing of a giant panda cub with a low birth weight	The average weight for neonatal giant panda cubs in captivity is approximately 142.6 ±39.4 g. Occasionally there are some that have a body weight lower than 70 g. These smaller neonates have a high mortality rate. In 2006, a female panda at the Chengdu Research Base for Giant Panda Breeding, gave birth to twins. One of the neonatal cubs had an extremely low birth weight of 51 g. This cub was weak, had a low body temperature of 33. 4 °C, and was unable to nurse. We successfully reared the cub by maintaining his normal temperature in an incubator, and providing him with the appropriate amount of colostrum. When the cub gained enough body weight and strength to nurse, he was switched out with his sibling on the mother. The neonate in this study is the smallest giant panda born in captivity that survived. This article will compare the following aspects of the rearing of this underweight cub to those of normal weight cubs : environmental temperature, daily nursing bouts, and behavior of mother with cub. This investigation offers a method for rearing underweight giant panda cubs in the future.

79959697512	Complete mitochondrial genomes of Baylisascaris schroederi, Baylisascaris ailuri and Baylisascaris transfuga from giant panda, red panda and polar bear	Roundworms of the genus Baylisascaris are the most common parasitic nematodes of the intestinal tracts of wild mammals, and most of them have significant impacts in veterinary and public health. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes provide a foundation for studying epidemiology and ecology of these parasites and therefore may be used to assist in the control of Baylisascariasis. Here, we determined the complete sequences of mtDNAs for Baylisascaris schroederi, Baylisascaris ailuri and Baylisascaris transfuga, with 14,778. bp, 14,657. bp and 14,898. bp in size, respectively. Each mtDNA encodes 12 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs, typical for other chromadorean nematodes. The gene arrangements for the three Baylisascaris species are the same as those of the Ascaridata species, but radically different from those of the Spirurida species. Phylogenetic analysis based on concatenated amino acid sequences of 12 protein-coding genes from nine nematode species indicated that the three Baylisascaris species are more closely related to Ascaris suum than to the three Toxocara species (Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati and Toxocara malaysiensis) and Anisakis simplex, and that B. ailuri is more closely related to B. transfuga than to B. schroeder. The determination of the complete mt genome sequences for these three Baylisascaris species (the first members of the genus Baylisascaris ever sequenced) is of importance in refining the phylogenetic relationships within the order Ascaridida, and provides new molecular data for population genetic, systematic, epidemiological and ecological studies of parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance in wildlife. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80055000532	Molecular cloning and sequence analysis of VP6 gene of giant panda rotavirus strain CH-1	Rotavirus (family Reoviridae) is the leading cause of severe gastroenteritis in human and animals worldwide. The genome of rotavirus comprises of 11 segments of dsRNA and encodes six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and six non structural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). VP6 is a group of antigen of rotavirus (according to the disparation of VP6, rotavirus is classified into seven groups: A to G), and the major structural protein of inner capsid particles (ICP), and also specific antigen of mucosa immunization that mediate specific immunological reaction. In this report, sequence analysis of VP6 gene of giant panda rotavirus was carried out. Full-length VP6 gene encoding for ICP of giant panda rotavirus was amplified by RT-PCR and the amplicons (1356 bp) were cloned and sequenced. Comparative sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1194 nucleotides (nt) encoding a polypeptide of 397 amino acids (aa). Porcine and human rotaviruses VP6 were highly related giant panda rotavirus VP6 with sequence identity of 98.7 and 97% at the aa level, respectively. Further, they showed 62.9 to 95.1% sequence identity at the nt level with other species of rotavirus. Phylogenetic analysis also showed that giant panda rotavirus VP6 gene was closely related to porcine and human rotavirus. Together, these results may improve our understanding of the evolution, pathogenesis and functional studies of giant panda rotavirus, as well as contribute significantly to giant panda rotavirus research and possibly studies with other species rotaviruses. © 2011 Academic Journals.

80055063374	The mitochondrial genome of Baylisascaris procyonis	Background: Baylisascaris procyonis (Nematoda: Ascaridida), an intestinal nematode of raccoons, is emerging as an important helminthic zoonosis due to serious or fatal larval migrans in animals and humans. Despite its significant veterinary and public health impact, the epidemiology, molecular ecology and population genetics of this parasite remain largely unexplored. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes can provide a foundation for investigations in these areas and assist in the diagnosis and control of B. procyonis. In this study, the first complete mt genome sequence of B. procyonis was determined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based primer-walking strategy. Methodology/Principal Findings: The circular mt genome (14781 bp) of B. procyonis contained 12 protein-coding, 22 transfer RNA and 2 ribosomal RNA genes congruent with other chromadorean nematodes. Interestingly, the B. procyonis mtDNA featured an extremely long AT-rich region (1375 bp) and a high number of intergenic spacers (17), making it unique compared with other secernentean nematodes characterized to date. Additionally, the entire genome displayed notable levels of AT skew and GC skew. Based on pairwise comparisons and sliding window analysis of mt genes among the available 11 Ascaridida mtDNAs, new primer pairs were designed to amplify specific short fragments of the genes cytb (548 bp fragment) and rrnL (200 bp fragment) in the B. procyonis mtDNA, and tested as possible alternatives to existing mt molecular beacons for Ascaridida. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of mtDNAs provided novel estimates of the interrelationships of Baylisasaris and Ascaridida. Conclusions/Significance: The complete mt genome sequence of B. procyonis sequenced here should contribute to molecular diagnostic methods, epidemiological investigations and ecological studies of B. procyonis and other related ascaridoids. The information will be important in refining the phylogenetic relationships within the order Ascaridida and enriching the resource of markers for systematic, population genetic and evolutionary biological studies of parasitic nematodes of socio-economic importance. © 2011 Xie et al.

80055106402	Microsatellite variability reveals high genetic diversity and low genetic differentiation in a critical giant panda population	Understanding present patterns of genetic diversity is critical in order to design effective conservation and management strategies for endangered species. Tangjiahe Nature Reserve (NR) is one of the most important national reserves for giant pandas Ailuropoda melanoleuca in China. Previous studies have shown that giant pandas in Tangjiahe NR may be threatened by population decline and fragmentation. Here we used 10 microsatellite DNA markers to assess the genetic variability in the Tangjiahe population. The results indicate a low level of genetic differentiation between the Hongshihe and Motianling subpopulations in the reserve. Assignment tests using the Bayesian clustering method in STRUCTURE identified one genetic cluster from 42 individuals of the two subpopulations. All individuals from the same subpopulation were assigned to one cluster. This indicates high gene flow between subpopulations. F statistic analyses revealed a low F

8444246047	Cloning and expression of pituitary prolactin gene in Ailuropoda melanoleuca	The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered species and indigenous to China. It has been proposed that it has a highly specialized reproductive pattern with low fecundity, but little is known about its basic reproductive biology at molecular level. In this study, the pituitary prolactin (PRL) cDNA of giant panda was amplified by RT-PCR from pituitary total RNA and then cloned, sequenced and submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession No. AY161285). The sequence analysis revealed that the giant panda prolactin cDNA contains a 687-nucleotide open reading frame encoding the prolactin prohormone of 229 amino acid residues. The signal peptide contains 30 amino acid residues and the mature prolactin is composed of 199 amino acid residues. Then the DNA fragment amplified was subcloned into pGEX-4T-1 procaryotic expression plasmid and protein expression was induced by IPTG in Escherichia coli BL21. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the PRL protein is infusible. The multiple sequence alignments revealed that the homology of giant panda is 95% to cat and pig, 80%-70% to human, cow and goat, 52% to rat and 45.9% to mouse at the amino acid level. The 64th amino acid of giant panda prolactin is hydrophilic serine instead of hydrophobic proline of cat, goat, and cow or hydrophobic alanine of human.

84860556781	The application of HS-SPME-GC/MS in detecting chemical components in giant panda(Ailuropoda melanoleuca) urine	Urine plays an important role in chemical communication between giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). The detection of chemical compounds in giant panda urine is the key to identifying the compositions and assaying the function of each chemical compound. We used headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to pre-treat and analyze the composition of giant panda urine. We found 56 peaks and through searching the mass spectrometry library of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), 38 of them were putatively identified. In addition, we also modified the method of cleaning HS-SPME fiber. The results show that HS-SPME-GC/MS is an effective method to detect the volatile and semi-volatile compounds in giant panda urine. It is proved to be an important research tool for revealing the mechanism of chemical communication in the giant pandas.

84861036826	The occurrence of Dirofilaria immitis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophium in dogs in China	A survey of the occurrence of Dirofilaria immitis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophium in dogs was undertaken in the People's Republic of China between October 2008 and October 2009. A total of 600 blood samples were taken from dogs in four cities in China: 300 in Beijing, 150 in Shenzhen, 30 in Shanghai and 120 in Zhengzhou. All samples were tested for the heartworm antigen and antibodies of canine B. burgdorferi, E. canis and A. phagocytophium by using the canine SNAPc 4Dx® test kit. The occurrence of D. immitis, B. burgdorferi, E. canis and A. phagocytophium was 1.17% (7/600), 0.17% (1/600), 2.17% (13/600) and 0.5% (3/600), respectively. In Shenzhen city 2% (3/150), 8.67% (13/150) and 2% (3/150) of samples were positive for D. immitis, E. canis and A. phagocytophium, respectively. The occurrence of heartworm antigen was 0.33% (1/300) in Beijing, 2.00% (3/150) in Shenzhen, 3.33% (1/30) in Shanghai and 1.67% (2/120) in Zhengzhou. We found E. canis and A. phagocytophium only at one site, Shenzhen, while the only occurrence of B. burgdorferi was at Beijing. In conclusion, the dog population in China is at potential risk for D. immitis, B. burgdorferi, E. canis and A. phagocytophium infection, the risk being especially high in southern China. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.

84863921331	Sequence analysis of the Bs-Ag1 gene of baylisascaris schroederi from the giant panda and an evaluation of the efficacy of a recombinant baylisascaris schroederi Bs-Ag1 antigen in mice	The Baylisascaris schroederi infection rate among wild giant pandas may reach over 50% or even 100%, making it one of the leading causes of death from primary or secondary infection in wild populations. Until now, little was known about how protective immunity to B. schroederi infection could be achieved. The present study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of recombinant Bs-Ag1 from B. schroederi, by cloning the full-length Bs-Ag1 gene of B. schroederi and expressing it in a heterologous host, Escherichia coli BL21. In mice vaccinated with rBs-Ag1 coupled with Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), there was a significant reduction (69.2%) in the recovery of challenged B. schroederi L3 compared with either nonvaccinated controls or mice vaccinated with FCA alone. Our study supports the use of Bs-Ag1 as a potential candidate for vaccination against B. schroederi infection and provides basic data for further vaccination trials with mixtures of antigens (with Bs-Ag2 and Bs-Ag3) to B. schroederi. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84864225740	Novel insights into the transcriptome of Dirofilaria immitis	Background: The heartworm Dirofilaria immitis is the causal agent of cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis in dogs and cats, and also infects a wide range of wild mammals as well as humans. One bottleneck for the design of fundamentally new intervention and management strategies against D. immitis may be the currently limited knowledge of fundamental molecular aspects of D. immitis. Methodology/Principal Findings: A next-generation sequencing platform combining computational approaches was employed to assess a global view of the heartworm transcriptome. A total of 20,810 unigenes (mean length = 1,270 bp) were assembled from 22.3 million clean reads. From these, 15,698 coding sequences (CDS) were inferred, and about 85% of the unigenes had orthologs/homologs in public databases. Comparative transcriptomic study uncovered 4,157 filarial-specific genes as well as 3,795 genes potentially involved in filarial-Wolbachia symbiosis. In addition, the potential intestine transcriptome of D. immitis (1,101 genes) was mined for the first time, which might help to discover 'hidden antigens'. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides novel insights into the transcriptome of D. immitis and sheds light on its molecular processes and survival mechanisms.

84864406330	Determination of Baylisascaris schroederi infection in wild giant pandas by an accurate and sensitive PCR/CE-SSCP method	It has been recognized that other than habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, the infection of the roundworm Baylisascaris schroederi (B. schroederi) is one of the major causes of death in wild giant pandas. However, the prevalence and intensity of the parasite infection has been inconsistently reported through a method that uses sedimentation-floatation followed by a microscope examination. This method fails to accurately determine infection because there are many bamboo residues and/or few B. schroederi eggs in the examined fecal samples. In the present study, we adopted a method that uses PCR and capillary electrophoresis combined with a single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (PCR/CE-SSCP) to detect B. schroederi infection in wild giant pandas at a nature reserve, and compared it to the traditional microscope approach. The PCR specifically amplified a single band of 279-bp from both fecal samples and positive controls, which was confirmed by sequence analysis to correspond to the mitochondrial COII gene of B. schroederi. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the amount of genomic DNA was linearly correlated with the peak area of the CE-SSCP analysis. Thus, our adopted method can reliably detect the infectious prevalence and intensity of B. schroederi in wild giant pandas. The prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be 54% in the 91 fecal samples examined, and 48% in the fecal samples of 31 identified individual giant pandas. Infectious intensities of the 91 fecal samples were detected to range from 2.8 to 959.2 units/gram, and from 4.8 to 959.2 units/gram in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas. For comparison, by using the traditional microscope method, the prevalence of B. schroederi was found to be only 33% in the 91 fecal samples, 32% in the fecal samples of the 31 identified giant pandas, and no reliable infectious intensity was observed. © 2012 Zhang et al.

84866105974	Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of ascarid nematodes from twenty-one species of captive wild mammals based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences	Although ascarid nematodes are important parasites of wild animals of public health concern, few species of ascarids from wild animals have been studied at the molecular level so far. Here, the classification and phylogenetic relationships of roundworms from 21 species of captive wild animals have been studied by sequencing and analysis of parts of the ribosomal 18S and 28S genes and the mitochondrial (mt) 12S gene. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by 3 methods (NJ/MP/ML) based on the data of single gene sequences and concatenated sequences. Homology analysis indicated that the 18S sequences were conserved among roundworms from all 21 species and that 28S showed interspecies variability. Divergence levels displayed in 12S suggested that 12S appears to be either intra-or interspecifically variable. Evolutionary trees indicated that the ascarids split into 2 families, 4 genera and 7 species, with high bootstrap support for each clade. Combined trees suggested that Baylisascaris ailuri is more closely related to B. transfuga than to B. schroederi. This study provides useful molecular markers for the classification, phylogenetic analysis and epidemiological investigation of roundworms from wild animals. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.

0037310074	The structure and biological functions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)	The decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a kind of regulative neuropeptide synthesized by GnRH-producing cell bodies in hypothalamus and is an important information molecule among nervous, immune and neuroendocrine systems. GnRH plays a pivotal role in the regulation of reproduction. In recent years, GnRH-analogues have been one of the most widely applied hormonal medicine. The research progresses of GnRH were reviewed, including structure, localization and distribution of GnRH and its receptor. A series of evidences on GnRH regulating reproduction activity at different levels such as pituitary and gonad, factors affecting secretion of GnRH, as well as prospects of studies on GnRH are also introduced.

0037447939	Cloning and sequence analysis of FSH and LH in the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is an endangered species and indigenous to China. It has been proposed that it has a highly specialized reproductive pattern with low fecundity, but little is known about its basic reproductive biology at the molecular level. In this report the genes encoding gonadotropin subunits α, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) β and luteinizing hormone (LH) β of the giant panda were amplified for the first time by RT-PCR from pituitary total RNA, and were cloned, sequenced and analyzed. The results revealed that the open reading region (ORF) of gonadotropin subunits α, FSH β and LH β are 363, 390 and 426 bp long, respectively. They displayed a reasonably high degree (74-94, 85-93, 75-91%, for α, FSH β and LH β subunits, respectively) of identity when deduced amino acids were compared with homologous sequences from partial available mammals including human, cattle, sheep, pig, rat, mouse. Three distinct differences were found at the site of 59aa of the α subunit and 55aa, 68aa of FSH β subunit. Our results provide an insight into understanding the mechanism of reproduction regulation and genetic characteristics of giant panda which will make an actual contribution to its conservation. In addition they lay a foundation for a further study towards producing recombinant panda FSH and LH which can be used in artificial breeding aimed to increase its captive reproductive efficiency. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

0038697898	cDNA cloning of growth hormone from giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and its expression in Escherichia coli	A cDNA encoding Ailuropoda melanoleuca growth hormone (AmGH) was isolated from pituitary total RNA using RT-PCR and expressed in Escherichia coli. This is the first report of a GH nucleotide and amino acid (aa) sequence from giant panda. The open reading frame of AmGH (651 bp) encodes a precursor of 216 aa comprising a 26 aa signal peptide and a 190 aa mature protein with four cysteine residues similar to the typical primary structure of mammalian GH precursor. AmGH shares a high degree of identity (54-98.9%) with that of mammals, birds and amphibians, but a very low identity with bony fish GH (only 20-30%). The mature AmGH exhibits striking similarity to that of putative ancestral GH with a difference of only two residues, indicating a very slow basal rate of molecular evolution. The DNA fragment encoding mature AmGH was then subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector and highly expressed in E. coli host BL21 with IPTG induction. The expressed proteins fused to GST were found to be sequestered into inclusion bodies and therefore the NaOH method was employed to solubilize the inclusion bodies; the proteins were further purified by Glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. The production and purification of GST-AmGH reported here provide a basis for further studies on the biological activity of AmGH. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

84871986062	Whole-genome sequencing of giant pandas provides insights into demographic history and local adaptation	The panda lineage dates back to the late Miocene and ultimately leads to only one extant species, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Although global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances are recognized to shape animal population demography their contribution to panda population dynamics remains largely unknown. We sequenced the whole genomes of 34 pandas at an average 4.7-fold coverage and used this data set together with the previously deep-sequenced panda genome to reconstruct a continuous demographic history of pandas from their origin to the present. We identify two population expansions, two bottlenecks and two divergences. Evidence indicated that, whereas global changes in climate were the primary drivers of population fluctuation for millions of years, human activities likely underlie recent population divergence and serious decline. We identified three distinct panda populations that show genetic adaptation to their environments. However, in all three populations, anthropogenic activities have negatively affected pandas for 3,000 years. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

84874881470	Identification of Dirofilaria immitis miRNA using illumina deep sequencing	The heartworm Dirofilaria immitis is the causative agent of cardiopulmonary dirofilariosis in dogs and cats, which also infects a wide range of wild mammals and humans. The complex life cycle of D. immitis with several developmental stages in its invertebrate mosquito vectors and its vertebrate hosts indicates the importance of miRNA in growth and development, and their ability to regulate infection of mammalian hosts. This study identified the miRNA profiles of D. immitis of zoonotic significance by deep sequencing. A total of 1063 conserved miRNA candidates, including 68 anti-sense miRNA (miRNA*) sequences, were predicted by computational methods and could be grouped into 808 miRNA families. A significant bias towards family members, family abundance and sequence nucleotides was observed. Thirteen novel miRNA candidates were predicted by alignment with the Brugia malayi genome. Eleven out of 13 predicted miRNA candidates were verified by using a PCR-based method. Target genes of the novel miRNA candidates were predicted by using the heartworm transcriptome dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first report of miRNA profiles in D. immitis, which will contribute to a better understanding of the complex biology of this zoonotic filarial nematode and the molecular regulation roles of miRNA involved. Our findings may also become a useful resource for small RNA studies in other filarial parasitic nematodes. © 2013Fu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878009966	Identification of canine parvovirus with the Q370R point mutation in the VP2 gene from a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	Background: In this study, we sequenced and phylogenetic analyses of the VP2 genes from twelve canine parvovirus (CPV) strains obtained from eleven domestic dogs and a giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) in China. A novel canine parvovirus (CPV) was detected from the giant panda in China. Results: Nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein VP2 gene classified the CPV as a new CPV-2a type. Substitution of Gln for Arg at the conserved 370 residue in CPV presents an unusual variation in the new CPV-2a amino acid sequence of the giant panda and is further evidence for the continuing evolution of the virus. Conclusions: These findings extend the knowledge on CPV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores. © 2013 guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84882322367	Characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow of Giant Panda	In present study, we report on bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are isolated from giant pandas. Cells were collected from the BM of two stillborn giant pandas. The cells were cultured and expanded in 10% fetal bovine serum medium. Cell morphology was observed under an inverted microscopy, and the proliferation potential of the cells was evaluated by counting cell numbers for eight consecutive days. Differentiation potentials of the cells were determined by using a variety of differentiation protocols for osteocytes, adipocytes, neuron cells, and cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, the specific gene expressions for MSCs or differentiated cells were analyzed by RT-PCR. The isolated cells exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology; expressed mesenchymal specific markers such as cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73), SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX-2), guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3 (GNL3), and stem cell factor receptor (SCFR); and could be differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes that were characterized by Alizarin Red and Oil Red O staining. Under appropriate induction conditions, these cells were also able to differentiate into neuroglial-like or myocardial-like cells that expressed specific myocardial markers such as GATA transcription factors 4 (GATA-4), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and myosin heavy chain 7B (MYH7B), or neural specific markers such as Nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). This study demonstrated stem cells recovery and growth from giant pandas. The findings suggest that cells isolated from the BM of giant pandas have a high proliferative capacity and multiple differentiation potential in vitro which might aid conservation efforts. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84884863484	Potential of recombinant inorganic pyrophosphatase antigen as a new vaccine candidate against Baylisascaris schroederi in mice	The intestinal nematode Baylisascaris schroederi is an important cause of death for wild and captive giant pandas. Inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) are critical for development and molting in nematode parasites and represent potential targets for vaccination. Here, a new PPase homologue, Bsc-PYP-1, from B. schroederi was identified and characterized, and its potential as a vaccine candidate was evaluated in a mouse challenge model. Sequence alignment of PPases from nematode parasites and other organisms show that Bsc-PYP-1 is a nematode-specific member of the family I soluble PPases. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong localization of native Bsc-PYP-1 to the body wall, gut epithelium, ovary and uterus of adult female worms. Additionally, Bsc-PYP-1 homologues were found in roundworms infecting humans (Ascaris lumbricoides), swine (Ascaris suum) and dogs (Toxocara canis). In two vaccine trials, recombinant Bsc-PYP-1 (rBsc-PYP-1) formulated with Freund complete adjuvant induced significantly high antigen-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)G but no IgE or IgM responses. Analysis of IgG-subclass profiles revealed a greater increase of IgG1 than IgG2a. Splenocytes from rBsc-PYP-1/FCA-immunized mice secreted low levels of T helper (Th)1-type cytokines, interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-2, while producing significantly high levels of IL-10 and significantly elevated levels of IL-4 (Th2 cytokines) after stimulation with rBsc-PYP-1 in vitro. Finally, vaccinated mice had 69.02-71.15% reductions (in 2 experiments) in larval recovery 7 days post-challenge (dpc) and 80% survival at 80 dpc. These results suggest that Th2-mediated immunity elicited by rBsc-PYP-1 provides protection against B. schroederi, and the findings should contribute to further development of Bsc-PYP-1 as a candidate vaccine against baylisascariasis. © 2013 Xie et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0345763018	Changes of immunoglobulins in colostrums of giant pandas	This paper first reports that the contents of sIgA, IgG and IgM of 3 giant pandas' colostrums from day 1 to day 14 unconsecutively which have been determined by the method of "A Rate Nephelometer for Measuring Specific Protein by Immunopreciptin Reaction". The results indicated that sIgA is the most important immunuoglobulins of giant panda's colostrums, and IgG, IgM are also the major components of giant panda's colostrums. The contents of immunoglobulins in colostrums of giant pandas vary with the day : 1) the content of colostral sIgA is in the highest level (1 442.93 mg/dl) in 1st day, and maintains a higher level (1 200 - 1 300 mg/dl) from 2nd day to 5th day, it drops abruptly in 7th day (727.61 mg/dl); 2) the content of colostral IgG is in the hingest level (861.5 mg/dl), and maintains in a higher level (648.74 - 707.07 mg/dl) from 2nd day to 5th day, but drops abruptly in 7th day (375.14 mg/dl); 3) the content of colostral IgM varies rarely and maintains in a stable level during the first postpartum 5 days, and drops abruptly in 7th day. Based on the changes of immunoglobulins in giant panda's milks, the author conclude that milks from 1st day to 5th day postpartum should be giant panda's colostrums.

84895813452	Expression of translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) gene of Dirofilaria immitis guided by transcriptomic screening	Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) infections affect domestic dogs, cats, and various wild mammals with increasing incidence in temperate and tropical areas. More sensitive antibody detection methodologies are required to diagnose asymptomatic dirofilariasis with low worm burdens. Applying current transcriptomic technologies would be useful to discover potential diagnostic markers for D. immitis infection. A filarial homologue of the mammalian translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) was initially identified by screening the assembled transcriptome of D. immitis (DiTCTP). A BLAST analysis suggested that the DiTCTP gene shared the highest similarity with TCTP from Loa loa at protein level (97%). A histidine-tagged recombinant DiTCTP protein (rDiTCTP) of 40 kDa expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) showed immunoreactivity with serum from a dog experimentally infected with heartworms. Localization studies illustrated the ubiquitous presence of rDiTCTP protein in the lateral hypodermal chords, dorsal hypodermal chord, muscle, intestine, and uterus in female adult worms. Further studies on D. immitis-derived TCTP are warranted to assess whether this filarial protein could be used for a diagnostic purpose. © 2014, Korean Society for Parasitology and Tropical Medicine.

84905457937	Hypoxia Adaptations in the Grey Wolf (Canis lupus chanco) from Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	The Tibetan grey wolf (Canis lupus chanco) occupies habitats on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a high altitude (>3000 m) environment where low oxygen tension exerts unique selection pressure on individuals to adapt to hypoxic conditions. To identify genes involved in hypoxia adaptation, we generated complete genome sequences of nine Chinese wolves from high and low altitude populations at an average coverage of 25× coverage. We found that, beginning about 55,000 years ago, the highland Tibetan grey wolf suffered a more substantial population decline than lowland wolves. Positively selected hypoxia-related genes in highland wolves are enriched in the HIF signaling pathway (P = 1.57E-6), ATP binding (P = 5.62E-5), and response to an oxygen-containing compound (P≤5.30E-4). Of these positively selected hypoxia-related genes, three genes (EPAS1, ANGPT1, and RYR2) had at least one specific fixed non-synonymous SNP in highland wolves based on the nine genome data. Our re-sequencing studies on a large panel of individuals showed a frequency difference greater than 58% between highland and lowland wolves for these specific fixed non-synonymous SNPs and a high degree of LD surrounding the three genes, which imply strong selection. Past studies have shown that EPAS1 and ANGPT1 are important in the response to hypoxic stress, and RYR2 is involved in heart function. These three genes also exhibited significant signals of natural selection in high altitude human populations, which suggest similar evolutionary constraints on natural selection in wolves and humans of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. © 2014 Zhang et al.

10744231878	Behavioral and Developmental Consequences of Early Rearing Experience for Captive Giant Pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)	Mother-reared (MR) and peer-reared (PR) captive giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) cubs were compared to evaluate the effects of early removal from mother on behavioral development. Males and females and twins and singletons were compared to assess the effects of social setting on behavioral development. Subjects included 2 PR females, 3 MR females, 3 MR males, and 3 mothers. MR cubs spent more time manipulating bamboo and fell more often than PR cubs. PR cubs spent more time inactive. Male cubs directed more playful behavior at their mothers. Twins spent more time play fighting with their mothers than with their siblings. The results suggest that peer-rearing does not provide young pandas with the same level of social stimulation as mother-rearing.
