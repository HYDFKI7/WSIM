28044451733	Targeted oligonucleotide-mediated microsatellite identification (TOMMI) from large-insert library clones	Background: In the last few years, microsatellites have become the most popular molecular marker system and have intensively been applied in genome mapping, biodiversity and phylogeny studies of livestock. Compared to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as another popular marker system, microsatellites reveal obvious advantages. They are multi-allelic, possibly more polymorphic and cheaper to genotype. Calculations showed that a multi-allelic marker system always has more power to detect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) than does a di-allelic marker system [1]. Traditional isolation methods using partial genomic libraries are time-consuming and cost-intensive. In order to directly generate microsatellites from large-insert libraries a sequencing approach with repeat-containing oligonucleotides is introduced. Results: Seventeen porcine microsatellite markers were isolated from twelve PAC clones by targeted oligonucleotide-mediated microsatellite identification (TOMMI), an improved efficient and rapid flanking sequence-based approach for the isolation of STS-markers. With the application of TOMMI, an average of 1.55 (CA/GT) microsatellites per PAC clone was identified.

3142571060	Genetic variations of the porcine PRKAG3 gene in Chinese indigenous pig breeds	Four missense substitutions (T30N, G52S, V199I and R200Q) in the porcine PRKAG3 gene were considered as the likely candidate loci affecting meat quality. In this study, the R200Q substitution was investigated in a sample of 62 individuals from Hampshire, Chinese Min and Erhualian pigs, and the genetic variations of T30N, G52S and V199I substitutions were detected in 1505 individuals from 21 Chinese indigenous breeds, 5 Western commercial pig breeds, and the wild pig. Allele 200R was fixed in Chinese Min and Erhualian pigs. Haplotypes II-QQ and IV-QQ were not observed in the Hampshire population, supporting the hypothesis that allele 200Q is tightly linked with allele 199V. Significant differences in allele frequencies of the three substitutions (T30N, G52S and V199I) between Chinese indigenous pigs and Western commercial pigs were observed. Obvious high frequencies of the "favorable" alleles 30T and 52G in terms of meat quality were detected in Chinese indigenous pigs, which are well known for high meat quality. However, the frequency of the "favorable" allele 199I, which was reported to have a greater effect on meat quality in comparison with 30T and 52G, was very low in all of the Chinese indigenous pigs except for the Min pig. The reasons accounting for this discrepancy remain to be addressed. The presence of the three substitutions in purebred Chinese Tibetan pigs indicates that the three substitutions were ancestral mutations. A novel A/G substitution at position 51 in exon 1 was identified. The results suggest that further studies are required to investigate the associations of these substitutions in the PRKAG3 gene with meat quality of Chinese indigenous pigs, and to uncover other polymorphisms in the PRKAG3 gene with potential effects on meat quality in Chinese indigenous pigs.

33645123128	Genetic variation of porcine prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) gene and its association with reproductive traits in an Erhualian × Duroc F2 population	Identification of major genes that genetically impact female fertility is important for successful selection of high prolificacy pig lines. Because it is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs), which are important for ovulation, fertilization, implantation, decidualization and parturition, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 gene (PTGS2) is a potential candidate gene affecting porcine reproductive traits.

33845438714	Mutation in the porcine SERPINA7 gene and its association with boar fertility	The porcine SERPINA7 gene is considered as a positional candidate gene responsible for testis size for its location on X chromosome and its biologically critical role in the development of testis. A nonsynonymous polymorphism His226Asn or C678A in the ligand-binding domain of SERPINA7 has been identified, which alters SERPINA7' s affinity to thyroxine and is closely associated with testis size. In this study, a primer mutagenesis strategy was developed to genotype this polymorphism in Chinese indigenous pigs and some western commercial pigs. The C allele existed in all tested Chinese indigenous and wild pigs, while the A allele is specific for western commercial breeds, indicating the occurrence of the mutation is of western origin. The correlation of this polymorphism with different boar fertility traits was assessed using a White Duroc × Erhualian intercross which included 110 F

34547112519	The g.243A>G mutation in intron 17 of MUC4 is significantly associated with susceptibility/resistance to ETEC F4ab/ac infection in pigs	Using a porcine radiation hybrid panel, we assigned the mucin 4 (MUC4) gene to SSC13q41, which harbours the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4ab/ac receptor locus. In addition, we identified two SNPs in intron 17 of MUC4 (DQ124298:g.243A>G and DQ124298:g.334A>G) in the parental population of a White Duroc × Erhualian cross. Association analysis showed that the MUC4 g.243A>G mutation was strongly associated with ETEC F4ab/ac, and especially with F4ac adhesion phenotypes in the White Duroc × Erhualian resource population, indicating that this polymorphism was in a significant linkage disequlibrium with the ETEC F4ab/ac receptor locus. Because of different linkage disequlibrium values between the ETEC F4ab and F4ac adhesion phenotypes and the MUC4 g.243A>G mutation, we argue that the inheritance of F4ab and F4ac receptors might be under the control of two closely linked loci. © 2007 Jiangxi Agricultural University.

34547227250	Characterization of polymorphisms of transferrin receptor and their association with susceptibility to ETEC F4ab/ac in pigs	Summary Diarrhoea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) expressing F4 (F4ab, F4ac and F4ad) fimbriae is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in newborn and weaned pigs. The locus controlling susceptibility towards ETEC F4ab/ac has been mapped to SSC13q41, in which TFRC (transferrin receptor) was localized and considered as a positional candidate gene for ETEC F4ab/ac receptor. In this study, we determined susceptibility/resistance to ETEC F4ab/ac in a total of 755 F2 animals from a White Duroc × Erhualian intercross using a microscopic enterocyte adhesion assay. We identified two TFRC polymorphisms (SNPs 591 A>G and 632 A>G) in a single exon after comparative sequencing analysis of 2371-bp amplicons containing the complete coding region of TFRC using RNA of eight full-sib F2 animals with susceptible and resistant phenotypes. The intron sequences flanking the two exon polymorphisms were obtained, revealing an intron polymorphism (SNP 291 C>T). We genotyped the 19 founder animals of the White Duroc × Erhualian intercross for the identified polymorphisms, showing that only the 291 C>T polymorphism is a highly informative marker. We further genotyped all 59 F1 and 755 F2 animals for the 291 C>T polymorphism, and the association of this polymorphism with susceptibility/resistance to ETEC F4ab/ac in these F2 animals was evaluated by the transmission disequilibrium test. The result showed that the 291 C>T polymorphism is not a causal mutation, however, has a significant linkage disequilibrium with the ETEC F4ab/ac, especially F4ac receptor locus. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

34548447063	Chinese white rongchang pig does not have the dominant white allele of KIT but has the dominant black allele of MC1R	The mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (KIT) and melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) mutations are responsible for coat color phenotypes in domestic pigs. Rongchang is a Chinese indigenous pig breed with a white coat color phenotype. To investigate the genetic variability of the KIT and MC1R genes and their possible association with the coat color phenotype in this breed, a gene duplication and splice mutation of KIT were diagnosed in a sample of 93 unrelated Rongchang animals. The results show that Rongchang pigs have a single copy of KIT without the splice mutation at the first nucleotide of intron 17, indicating that the dominant white I allele of KIT is not responsible for their white phenotype. The KIT mRNA and MC1R coding sequences were also determined in this breed. Three putative amino acid substitutions were found in the KIT gene between Rongchang and Western white pigs, their association with the Rongchang white phenotype remains unknown. For the MC1R gene, Rongchang pigs were demonstrated to have the same dominant black allele (E

35549004470	Associations between 45T/G polymorphism of the adiponectin gene and plasma adiponectin levels with Type 2 diabetes	1. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 45T/G and plasma adiponectin levels and the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Uygurs of the Xinjiang region, China. 2. We performed a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 151 Uygur adults aged 24-80 years. The polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was used to determine the distribution of allele and genotype frequency of the SNP45 T/G polymorphism (exon 2) in the adiponectin gene. An ELISA was used to determine plasma adiponectin levels. Logistic regression was used to screen risk factors for T2DM. 3. Compared with the normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group, the T2DM group exhibited a higher distribution of the TG + GG genotype, G allele frequency and lower plasma adiponectin concentrations in TG + GG genotype carriers compared with those with the TT genotype. Compared with SNP45 T carriers, in the NGT group, G carriers had higher levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low density lipoprotein (P < 0.05) and total cholesterol (P < 0.005). In the T2DM group, G carriers had lower levels of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin sensitivity (P < 0.05) and higher levels of HOMA of insulin resistance (P < 0.05). 4. Adiponectin SNP 45 is positively correlated with the prevalence of T2DM in Uygurs of Xinjiang. The G allele carriers who have reduced plasma concentrations of adiponectin may have associated insulin resistance. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

36849058674	The porcine nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCOR1) gene: Chromosome location, expression profile, and polymorphism	NCOR1 (nuclear receptor co-repressor1) encodes a protein that represses the expression of the targeted genes by promoting chromatin condensation and disabling access to the transcription machinery. So far, only a few NCOR1 EST sequences are available, and the chromosomal location of NCOR1 is unknown in the porcine genome. In this study, we have localized NCOR1 to the end of pig chromosome (SSC) 12 by a porcine radiation hybrid panel. The expression profile of NCOR1 was clarified using RNA from 18 tissues, and it is expressed ubiquitously in pigs. We did not identify any missense mutation in the exonic region encoding the first SANT domain of the NCOR1 protein, although we found six SNPs and two deletions in intron 12, and three SNPs and one deletion in intron 13, using DNA of 10 founder animals in a White Duroc × Erhualian intercross. These polymorphic markers can be integrated into a genome scan for identifying the QTL affecting economically important traits in pigs. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

So far only a partial porcine IGFALS sequence is available. We herein report the isolation, characterization, polymorphism identification and expression analysis of the porcine IGFALS gene. A 2000-bp full-length cDNA sequence was determined with 5′- and 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE) assay. It contains a 1821-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 606 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 66 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 6.89. The deduced IGFALS protein shares high identity (70-80%) with other mammalian IGFALS. We also obtained a full-length genomic DNA sequence of the gene. Similar to the other mammalian orthologues, particularly in terms of exon size and exon/intron boundaries, the porcine IGFALS gene spans a transcription unit of 2990 bp, consisting of two exons and one intron. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (synonymous mutations) were identified in the DNA sequence. RT-PCR assays indicate that IGFALS is expressed ubiquitously in pigs and transcripts are particularly abundant in the liver, lung, white adipose tissue, prostate, epididymis, thyroid and bladder. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

58849141360	A pig-human comparative RH map comprising 20 genes on pig chromosome 13q41 that harbours the ETEC F4ac receptor locus	The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4ac is a major cause of diarrhoea in newborn and young pigs. The locus for the intestinal ETEC F4ac receptor (F4acR) has been mapped to pig chromosome (SSC) 13q41 with known homology to human chromosome (HSA) 3q21 and q29. However, the causative gene and mutation(s) remain unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize gene-derived markers on SSC13q41 for fine mapping of the F4acR locus, and construct a high-resolution pig-human comparative map to select positional candidate genes for F4acR. Pig-specific sequence-tagged site markers were developed for 20 genes that are located in a 6.8-Mb region on HSA3q21 and q29, and a total of 34 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in 14 of 20 markers developed. Eighteen markers were mapped to SSC13q41, while the other two markers (PLXNA1 and KLF15) were assigned to SSC13q32 and SSC7q13, respectively, by radiation hybrid mapping. This result showed that there was a small conserved segment on SSC7 corresponding to HSA3q21. A framework map comprising 18 markers on SSC13q41 was established, refining the synteny breakpoint on SSC13q41 to a region of 12.3 centiRay. The comparative radiation hybrid (RH) map revealed three interesting candidate genes for F4acR from the human genome, viz. MUC4, MUC13 and MUC20. Linkage analysis with six marker polymorphisms revealed that MUC4 had the most significant linkage with the F4acR locus. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

60549096345	Comparison of production traits between pigs with and without the Escherichia coli F4 receptors in a White Duroc x Erhualian intercross F2 population	To evaluate the influence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4 receptors on production traits in pigs, ETEC F4ab, F4ac, and F4ad adhesion phenotypes and 27 traits related to growth, carcass, meat quality, and length of the small intestine in a White Duroc × Erhualian intercross population were measured. Performance data revealed that pigs with the F4ab or F4ac receptor (adhesive phenotypes) had greater (P < 0.01) ADG during the fattening period (from 46 to 240 d) and carcass weight and length at 240 d than pigs lacking the receptors (nonadhesive phenotype). Conversely, animals having the F4ad receptor had less (P < 0.01) ADG during the fattening period and carcass weight than those lacking the receptor. In total, 8 adhesion patterns (A to H) for the 3 F4 strains were observed in this experimental population. Pigs with both F4ab and F4ac receptors (phenotype B) had greater (P < 0.01) ADG, carcass weight, and length at 240 d compared with pigs without the F4 receptors. No difference was found (P > 0.05) in traits related to meat quality, fatness, and length of the small intestine between pigs with or without the receptors. On the basis of the antagonistic relationship between susceptibility to F4ab/ac and production traits, we speculate that the prevalence of the ETEC F4ab/ac adhesive phenotype in pig populations is attributable to balanced natural and artificial selection. © 2009 American Society of Animal Science.

The locus encoding intestinal receptor for ETEC F4ab/ac has been mapped to pig chromosome (SSC) 13q41. We previously assigned mucin 20 (MUC20) to SSC13q41 and considered it a candidate for the ETEC F4ab/ac receptor. In this study, the full-length mRNA sequence of the porcine MUC20 gene was determined, revealing two MUC20 alternative transcripts differing in an 18-bp deletion in the open reading frame (ORF). The longer isoform is 1,927-bp long and contains a 1,572-bp ORF encoding a protein of 523 amino acids. RT-PCR analysis showed that MUC20 mRNA was expressed most highly in the kidney, prostate, epididymis and bladder. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms in MUC20 were identified in founder animals of a White Duroc × Erhualian cross, and the entire cross population (n = 842) was genotyped for two MUC20 polymorphisms: g.191C>T in intron 5 and c.1600C>T in exon 6. The transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) results revealed that both polymorphisms were significantly associated with in vitro ETEC F4ab/ac adhesion phenotypes in the intercross population, and the most significant association was found between g.191C>T and F4ac adhesion phenotype (P = 1.02 × 10

84876561852	A Further Look at Porcine Chromosome 7 Reveals VRTN Variants Associated with Vertebral Number in Chinese and Western Pigs	The number of vertebrae is an economically important trait that affects carcass length and meat production in pigs. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for thoracic vertebral number has been repeatedly identified on pig chromosome (SSC) 7. To dissect the genetic basis of the major locus, we herein genotyped a large sample of animals from 3 experimental populations of Chinese and Western origins using 60K DNA chips. Genome-wide association studies consistently identified the locus across the 3 populations and mapped the locus to a 947-Kb region on SSC7. An identical-by-descent sharing assay refined the locus to a 100-Kb segment that harbors only two genes including VRTN and SYNDIG1L. Of them, VRNT has been proposed as a strong candidate of the major locus in Western modern breeds. Further, we resequenced the VRTN gene using DNA samples of 35 parental animals with known QTL genotypes by progeny testing. Concordance tests revealed 4 candidate causal variants as their genotypes showed the perfect segregation with QTL genotypes of the tested animals. An integrative analysis of evolutional constraints and functional elements supported two VRTN variants in a complete linkage disequilibrium phase as the most likely causal mutations. The promising variants significantly affect the number of thoracic vertebrae (one vertebra) in large scale outbred animals, and are segregating at rather high frequencies in Western pigs and at relatively low frequencies in a number of Chinese breeds. Altogether, we show that VRTN variants are significantly associated with the number of thoracic vertebrae in both Chinese and Western pigs. The finding advances our understanding of the genetic architecture of the vertebral number in pigs. Furthermore, our finding is of economical importance as it provides a robust breeding tool for the improvement of vertebral number and meat production in both Chinese indigenous pigs and Western present-day commercial pigs. © 2013 Fan et al.

45149116551	Selection in the making: A worldwide survey of haplotypic diversity around a causative mutation in porcine IGF2	Domestic species allow us to study dramatic evolutionary changes at an accelerated rate due to the effectiveness of modern breeding techniques and the availability of breeds that have undergone distinct selection pressures. We present a worldwide survey of haplotype variability around a known causative mutation in porcine gene IGF2, which increases lean content. We genotyped 34 SNPs spanning 27 kb in 237 domestic pigs and 162 wild boars. Although the selective process had wiped out variability for at least 27 kb in the haplotypes carrying the mutation, there was no indication of an overall reduction in genetic variability of international vs. European local breeds; there was also no evidence of a reduction in variability caused by domestication. The haplotype structure and a plot of Tajima's D against the frequency of the causative mutation across breeds suggested a temporal pattern, where each breed corresponded to a different selective stage. This was observed comparing the haplotype neighbor-joining (NJ) trees of breeds that have undergone increasing selection pressures for leanness, e.g., European local breeds vs. Pietrain. These results anticipate that comparing current domestic breeds will decisively help to recover the genetic history of domestication and contemporary selective processes.

47349105531	Polymorphisms of three gene-derived STS on pig chromosome 13q41 are associated with susceptibility to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4ab/ac in pigs	Neonatal diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4 is a common and serious disease, resulting in significant economical loss in the pig industry. The locus encoding ETEC F4 receptor has been mapped to pig chromosome (SSC) 13q41, and one of the most significantly linked markers is S0075. In this study, we selected three genes including SLC12A8, MYLK and KPNA1 from a chromosomal region flanking S0075 on SSC13 to develop pig specific sequence tagged sites (STS). Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the three pig STS using DNA of four full-sib susceptible and resistant animals in a White Duroc x Erhualian intercross. All grandparents, parents and 755 offspring in the intercross were genotyped for three polymorphisms, including SLC12A8 g.159A>G, MYLK g.1673A>G and KPNA1 g.306A>G. Family-based transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) revealed that all polymorphisms and the corresponding haplotypes are significantly associated with ETEC F4ab/ac (especially F4ac) brush border adhesion phenotypes, indicating that these polymorphism are in linkage disequlibrium with causal mutation(s) of the gene encoding ETEC F4ab/ac receptor. Our results strengthen the evidence for the involvement of SSC13q41 in high acquiring risk of ETEC F4ab/ac infection, and provide novel polymorphic markers for fine mapping of the ETEC F4ab/ac receptor locus. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

KISS1R and its genetics in pigs remain unexplored. The objective of this study was to characterize the porcine KISS1R gene and evaluate the association of KISS1R mutations with age at puberty in sows. KISS1R was assigned to pig chromosome 2q21-24 by radiation hybrid mapping. It has a 1438 bp full-length cDNA and spans 3349 bp genomic sequence consisting of five exons and four introns. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that KISS1R transcripts was particularly abundant in the adrenal, prostate, testis, thymus, pituary and hypothalamus. KISS1R mRNA content in the hypothalamus was determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and it fluctuated during the oestrous cycle with the highest level in the luteal phase.

In this study, we performed a genome scan to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting age at puberty in gilts using a White Duroc Erhualian intercross. A total of 183 microsatellites covering 19 porcine chromosomes were genotyped in 454 F2 gilts and their parents and grandparents in the White Duroc Erhualian intercross. A linear regression method was used to map QTL for age at puberty via QTLexpress. One 1% genome-wise significant QTL and one 0.1% genome-wise significant QTL were detected at 114 cM (centimorgan) on SSC1 and at 54 cM on SSC7, respectively. Moreover, two suggestive QTL were found on SSC8 and SSC17, respectively. This study confirmed the QTL for age at puberty previously identified on SSC1, 7 and 8, and reports for the first time a QTL for age at puberty in gilts on SSC17. Interestingly, the Chinese Erhualian alleles were not systematically favourable for younger age at puberty. © 2008 INRA EDP Sciences.

The genetic variations in a 1.6 kb region spanning exon 1 and exon 3 of the porcine NRAMP1 gene were investigated by PCR-Hinf/I-RFLP in samples of 1347 individuals from 21 Chinese indigenous pig populations and 3 western pig breeds. Three alleles (A, B, C) and four genotypes (AA, BB, AB, BC) were detected. Significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies were observed between Chinese indigenous pig populations and exotic pig breeds, while in general the differences in genotype and allele frequencies among Chinese indigenous pig populations were not significant. The allele C was detected only in Duroc, Leping Spotted and Dongxiang Spotted pig, and the two Chinese pig populations showed similar genotype and allele frequencies. Four Chinese Tibetan pig populations displayed genetic differentiation at the NRAMP1 gene locus. In addition, intron 5 of the NRAMP1 gene was isolated and characterized by directly sequencing the PCR products encompassing intron 5. The alignment of intron 5 of the porcine, human, equine and ovine NRAMP1 gene showed a similarity of 45.38% between pig and human, 52.55% between pig and horse, 63.47% between pig and sheep, respectively.

5444268545	Isolation and molecular characterization of the porcine stearoyl-CoA desaturase gene	Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. So far only a partial porcine SCD sequence is available. Here we described the isolation and molecular characterization of the full-length cDNA and the determination of the genomic DNA sequence of the porcine SCD gene. The 5134-bp cDNA contains a 1080-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 359 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41.3 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.4. The porcine SCD protein shares high identity (>80%) with the other mammalian SCD. To further elucidate the genomic structure of the porcine SCD gene, we sequenced 20,985 bp of genomic DNA sequence encompassing the complete pig SCD gene. Similar to the other mammalian orthologs, particularly in term of exon size and exon/intron boundaries, the porcine SCD gene spans a transcription unit of 16,186 bp, consisting of six exons with sizes ranging from 131 to 4048 bp, and five introns varying in size from 518 to 4784 bp. The gene reveals a 176-bp-long 5′ UTR and possesses an unusually long 3′UTR of 3848 bp in the last exon. Comparison of different mammalian SCD promoters identified some regulatory domains required for the transcription regulation in the 5′ flanking sequence of the porcine SCD gene, such as the conserved polyunsaturated fatty acid response region (PUFA-RE). A total of 21 gene polymorphisms were revealed in the 21-kb DNA sequence, including 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), a 24-bp-long fragment length polymorphism in the fourth intron and a triplet nucleotide insertion in the fifth intron. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR result indicates that the SCD gene is expressed ubiquitously in pigs. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Licha Black is one of the leanest Chinese indigenous pig breeds, having an average vertebral number of 21.5. The introgression of Western germplasm into Licha Black, resulting in increased vertebral number, has been assumed but is not confirmed. This study detected allele frequencies of the NR6A1 causative mutation (c.575T>C) in 519 pigs from three Western and seven Chinese breeds including Licha Black, and evaluated the genetic variation in a 650-kb region containing NR6A1 in the 10 breeds. Allele T for increased vertebral number was fixed in Western breeds. In contrast, this allele was very rare in most of the Chinese native breeds. Notably, the T allele was present in the Licha Black at a rather higher frequency (0.585) and in the Laiwu at lower frequency (0.250). As expected, selection pressure has wiped out the genetic variability in the 650 kb region in Western breeds. Conversely, Chinese indigenous breeds showed a high degree of genetic variability in this region. However, the Licha Black displayed dramatically reduced heterozygosity at the loci proximal to the causative mutation. Moreover, a high proportion (45.9%) of Licha Black pigs and a small number (21%) of Laiwu pigs had the Western NR6A1 haplotype, and the two breeds showed closer relationships with Western commercial breeds than other Chinese breeds in the phylogenic tree. When the results are taken together, this study supports the assumption that the Western NR6A1 haplotypes were introduced into Licha Black and possibly Laiwu and are associated with increased vertebral number. © 2009 The Authors.

65649086835	Quantitative trait loci for porcine white blood cells and platelet-related traits in a white duroc × Erhualian F2 resource population	White blood cell count and platelets are implicated as risk factors for common complex diseases. Genetic factors substantially affect these traits in humans and mice. However, little is known about the genetic architecture of these traits in pigs. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leucocyte- and platelet-related traits in pigs, the total leucocyte number and differential leucocyte counts including the fraction of basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, and a series of platelet parameters including platelet count, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width and plateletcrit were measured in 1033 F

67650744884	Distribution of Escherichia coli F4 adhesion phenotypes in pigs of 15 Chinese and Western breeds and a White DurocxErhualian intercross	Diarrhoea in newborn and weaned piglets is mainly caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) with fimbriae F4. To investigate the prevalence of resistance to three fimbrial strains, F4ab, F4ac and F4ad, among Chinese indigenous pigs and Western commercial pigs introduced into China, we determined the ETEC F4 adhesion phenotypes in 292 pure-bred piglets from three Western commercial breeds and 12 Chinese indigenous breeds, and a total of 1093 adult pigs in a White Duroc×Erhualian intercross, by an in vitro microscopic adhesion assay. All the Tibet and Lantang pigs and a majority of the Erhualian and Rongchang pigs were resistant (nonadherent) to ETEC F4 whereas all the Laiwu pigs and most of the Jiangquhai and Tongcheng pigs were susceptible (adhesive) to at least one of the F4 strains. Yushan Black pigs were uniformly resistant to F4ab, and Jinhua pigs were predominantly resistant to F4ac. Susceptible and resistant animals were observed in the other breeds, indicating that diarrhoea caused by ETEC F4 could be prevalent in these breeds. This study confirmed the existence of eight previously reported F4 adhesion patterns, and supported the assumption that the three F4 receptors are encoded by distinct loci. Expression of the weakly adherent phenotype was observed in six pure-bred piglets and 90 adult F

68349141076	Detection of quantitative trait loci for porcine susceptibility to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli F41 in a white duroc chinese erhualian resource population	Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrhoea in neonatal and postweaning pigs. F41 is one of ETEC fimbriae that adhere to the small intestinal epithelium and lead to development of diarrhoea. The genetic architecture of susceptibility to ETEC F41 remains elusive in pigs. In this study, we determined the in vitro adhesion phenotypes of ETEC F41 in a total of 835 F2 animals from a White Duroc Erhualian intercross, and performed a genome scan using both F2 and half-sib analyses with 183 microsatellite markers to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for porcine susceptibility to ETEC F41. The two analyses consistently revealed a 1% genome-wide significant QTL on pig chromosome 4. Moreover, we determined F41 adhesion phenotypes in 14 purebred Erhualian and 14 White Duroc pigs. The results showed that both the founder breeds are segregating for the F41 adhesion phenotype, while less percentage of Erhualian pigs were adhesive to ETEC F41 compared to White Duroc pigs. © The Animal Consortium 2009.

68349146039	A genome scan for loci affecting adipocyte size and number in abdominal fat in a White Duroc Erhualian F2 resource population	Adipocyte size and number are correlated with fat deposition, which is of major concern to human health and pork producers. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adipocyte size and number in pigs, a total of 341 F2 animals at 240 days in a White Duroc Erhualian cross were measured for the area, perimeters, volume and number of adipocyte in abdominal fat. A genome scan was performed on these animals and their parents and grandparents with 183 microsatellite markers spanning the pig genome. Five chromosomal regions showed effects on the traits measured, predominantly on adipocyte size, on pig chromosome (SSC) 1, 4, 7 and 9. Neither of these QTL has been reported before this study. The QTL for adipocyte size detected in this study perfectly correspond to the previously reported QTL for fatness traits on SSC1, 4 and 7. The most significant association was evidenced at 58 cM on SSC7. At the locus, the favorable allele decreasing adipocyte size was unusually originated from the obese Erhualian breed. Only a suggestive QTL was detected for adipocyte number on SSC9. The results shed new lights on the understanding of the genetic basis of fatness traits in pigs. © The Animal Consortium 2009.

77956332035	Isolation and molecular characterization of the porcine SLC6A14 gene excludes it as a candidate gene for fat deposition and growth	The gene encoding solute carrier family 6 member 14 (SLC6A14) has been considered as a candidate gene affecting human obesity. In this study, full-length cDNA (2237 bp) and DNA sequence (24 541 bp) of the porcine SLC6A14 gene were isolated. The porcine SLC6A14 cDNA contains a 5'-untranslated region of 57 bp, a 3'-untranslated region of 254 bp, and an open reading frame of 1926 bp, encoding a deduced protein of 642 amino acids with a molecular mass of 72. 475 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.82. The genomic structure of the porcine SLC6A14 gene is similar to mammalian orthologs, particularly in terms of exon size and exon/intron boundaries. It comprises 14 exons and 13 introns. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the porcine SLC6A14 mRNA expression was tissue-specific. Four SLC6A14 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, and 3 informative SNPs were chosen for genotyping in a White Duroc × Erhualian resource population with phenotype data of growth and fatness traits. The association analysis showed that the c.1438 G>A nonsynonymous polymorphism was associated with birth weight and 21-day body weight (P < 0.05), while g.7944 A>T was associated with 46-day body weight. Linkage and radiation hybrid mapping assigned SLC6A14 to a region around SW1522 on SSCXp13, which did not fall in the confidence interval of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for growth and fatness traits on SSCX in the resource population. These results indicate that SLC6A14 is not a positional candidate gene for the QTL affecting fatness and growth traits in pigs.

77957291629	Cloning, mapping and molecular characterization of porcine progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2) gene	Progesterone plays an important role in sow reproduction by stimulating classic genomic pathways via nuclear receptors and non-genomic pathways via membrane receptors such a progesterone receptor membrane component 2 (PGRMC2). In this work, we used radiation hybrid mapping to assign PGRMC2 to pig chromosome 8 and observed that this receptor has two transcripts in pigs. The full-length cDNA of the large transcript is 1858 bp long and contains a 669-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein of 223 amino acids. The shorter transcript encodes a protein of 170 amino acids. The porcine PGRMC2 gene consists of three exons 446 bp, 156 bp and 1259 bp in length. The promoter sequence is GC-rich and lacks a typical TATA box. Several putative cis-regulatory DNA motifs were identified in the 208-bp upstream genomic region. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in introns* and the 3' UTR. RT-PCR indicated that the PGRMC2 gene is expressed ubiquitously in all pig tissues examined. © 2010, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.

78649657614	Genetic variation within coat color genes of MC1R and ASIP in Chinese brownish red Tibetan pigs	Melanocortin receptor 1 (MC1R) and agouti signaling protein (ASIP) are two major genes affecting coat color phenotypes in mammals, and inactivation mutations in the MC1R gene are responsible for red coat color in European pig breeds. Conversely, the gain-of-function ASIP mutations block MC1R signaling and lead to the production of red pheomelanin. Chinese Tibetan pigs have three types of coat color phenotypes, including brownish red, solid black and black with patches of brownish red and white. Herein, we investigated variations of the MC1R and ASIP genes in Tibetan pigs. The results showed that the brownish red Tibet pig had the dominant black MC1R allele (E

Animals-Purebred 6- to 8-week-old pigs of 3 Western breeds introduced into China (n = 144) and 12 Chinese breeds (148) and 1,330 adult White Duroc-Erhualian crossbred pigs. Procedures-Brush border preparations were prepared from jejunal specimens collected from each pig following euthanasia. Each preparation was incubated with ETEC strains that had fimbrial adhesins K99, 987P, or F41; an ETEC K88- strain was used as a negative control sample. The mean number of brush border-bound bacteria in aliquots of the bacteria-brush border suspensions (determined via phase-contrast microscopy) was used to determine each pig's adhesion phenotype for ETEC K99, 987P, and F41 strains; the phenotype was classified as adhesive (susceptible) if = 10% of examined brush borders bound > 2 bacteria. Results-Most purebred and crossbred pigs had nonadhesive phenotypes with regard to ETEC K99 and 987P strains. For the F41 strain, 34.9% and 65.1% of all purebred pigs had adhesive and nonadhesive phenotypes, respectively; among crossbred pigs, these values were 39.2% and 60.8%, respectively. The percentage of pigs with the F41 adhesive phenotype was higher among Western breeds than it was among Chinese breeds (38.9% vs 31.1%). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results suggested that the ETEC F41 strain, but not the K99 or 987P strain, might be a cause of diarrhea in 6- to 8-week-old pigs in China.

79651469847	Association and haplotype analysis of candidate genes in five genomic regions linked to sow maternal infanticide in a white Duroc × Erhualian resource population	Background: Maternal infanticide is an extreme and failed maternal behavior, which is defined as an active attack on piglets using the jaws, resulting in serious or fatal bite wounds. It brings big economic loss to the pig industry and severe problems to piglets' welfare. But little is known about the genetic background of this behavior. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for maternal infanticide were identified in a White Duroc × Erhualian intercross by a non-parametric linkage analysis (NPL) in our previous study. In this study, associations of 194 microsatellite markers used in NPL analysis with maternal infanticide behavior were further analyzed by transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT). On this basis, seven genes (ESR2, EAAT2, BDNF, OXTR, 5-HTR2C, DRD1 and GABRA6) at five genomic regions were selected and further analyzed. Associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in each gene with maternal infanticide behavior were evaluated.Results: Microsatellite markers on pig chromosome (SSC) 2, 13, 15, and X displayed significance at P < 0.05 by both TDT and NPL. Of the seven candidate genes, three ESR2 SNPs had nominal evidence for association (P < 0.05). Allele A at EAAT2 g. 233G > A and allele T at DRD1 g.1013C > G > T also showed evidence of overtransmission to infanticidal sows. In the overall tests of association of haplotypes, candidate genes of ESR2, EAAT2 and DRD1 achieved overall significance level (P < 0.05). Haplotype [A; A; G], [G; A; G], [A; G; G] and [C; C], respectively, from ESR2, EAAT2 and DRD1 showed higher frequencies to infanticidal sows (P < 0.05). Alleles among haplotypes and SNPs which showed an overtransmission to infanticidal sows were from White Duroc.Conclusions: From association tests of SNPs and haplotypes, ESR2, EAAT2 and DRD1 showed significant associations with maternal infanticide. This result supported the existence of QTL for maternal infanticide behavior on SSC1, SSC2 and SSC16. © 2011 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79955089541	A 6-bp deletion in the TYRP1 gene causes the brown colouration phenotype in Chinese indigenous pigs	Brown coat colour has been described in Chinese-Tibetan, Kele, and Dahe pigs. Here, we report the identification of a causal mutation underlying the brown colouration. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on Tibetan and Kele pigs, and found that brown colours in Chinese breeds are controlled by a single locus on pig chromosome 1. By using a haplotype-sharing analysis, we refined the critical region to a 1.5-Mb interval that encompasses only one pigmentation gene: tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1). Mutation screens of sequence variants in the coding region of TYRP1 revealed a strong candidate causative mutation (c.1484-1489del). The protein-altering deletion showed complete association with the brown colouration across Chinese-Tibetan, Kele, and Dahe breeds by occurring exclusively in brown pigs (n121) and lacking in all non-brown-coated pigs (n745) from 27 different breeds. The findings provide the compelling evidence that brown colours in Chinese indigenous pigs are caused by the same ancestral mutation in TYRP1. To our knowledge, this study gives the first description of GWAS identifying causal mutation for a monogenic trait in the domestic pig. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0018-067X/11.

0036212686	Relationship of growth hormone (GH2) genotypes with some production performances in pig	The genotypes of 117 Nanchang White pigs and 361 Large Yorkshire pigs at GH 2 locus were detected by PCR-RFLP. The PCR products were cut by Apa I, and produced two alleles: A (449 + 101 + 55bp), and B(316 + 133 + 101 + 49bp). Effects of different genotypes on some important production traits involving the birth weight, 2-month body weight, 6-month body weight, corrected back-fat thickness, average back-fat thickness, feed to gain ratio and lean percentage were analyzed. The results showed that in Nanchang White pigs, no significant differences were observed between different genotypes and different growth and carcass traits; while in Large Yorkshire, the pigs with BB genotype had more lean percentage than pigs with AA genotype (P < 0.05).

79958016526	A missense mutation in PPARD causes a major QTL effect on ear size in pigs	Chinese Erhualian is the most prolific pig breed in the world. The breed exhibits exceptionally large and floppy ears. To identify genes underlying this typical feature, we previously performed a genome scan in a large scale White Duroc × Erhualian cross and mapped a major QTL for ear size to a 2-cM region on chromosome 7. We herein performed an identical-by-descent analysis that defined the QTL within a 750-kb region. Historically, the large-ear feature has been selected for the ancient sacrificial culture in Erhualian pigs. By using a selective sweep analysis, we then refined the critical region to a 630-kb interval containing 9 annotated genes. Four of the 9 genes are expressed in ear tissues of piglets. Of the 4 genes, PPARD stood out as the strongest candidate gene for its established role in skin homeostasis, cartilage development, and fat metabolism. No differential expression of PPARD was found in ear tissues at different growth stages between large-eared Erhualian and small-eared Duroc pigs. We further screened coding sequence variants in the PPARD gene and identified only one missense mutation (G32E) in a conserved functionally important domain. The protein-altering mutation showed perfect concordance (100%) with the QTL genotypes of all 19 founder animals segregating in the White Duroc × Erhualian cross and occurred at high frequencies exclusively in Chinese large-eared breeds. Moreover, the mutation is of functional significance; it mediates down-regulation of β-catenin and its target gene expression that is crucial for fat deposition in skin. Furthermore, the mutation was significantly associated with ear size across the experimental cross and diverse outbred populations. A worldwide survey of haplotype diversity revealed that the mutation event is of Chinese origin, likely after domestication. Taken together, we provide evidence that PPARD G32E is the variation underlying this major QTL. © 2011 Ren et al.

84860162784	Analysis of conserved flanking elements associated with antibiotic resistance genes dissemination	The overuse of antibiotics in medicine, animal husbandry, and aquiculture industry increases the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes(ARGs), and also, accelerates the dissemination of ARGs within environmental bacteria. In this study, the total DNA was directly extracted from environmental samples, and the upstream and downstream of antibiotic resistance genes were directly amplified by thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR(Tail-PCR) technique. By optimizing the Tail-PCR program, the multiple flanking sequences of tetW, including 6 upstream sequences and 9 downstream sequences, were simultaneously acquired. Through the bioinformatics analysis, the upstream of tetW presented a perfect inverted repeat(IR), a known tetW regulator peptide, and an insertional sequence(IS), whereas the downstream of tetW presented a most conservative fragment and a common open reading frame(ORF) coding methyltransferase. This study not only revealed several conserved flanking tetW gene modules, but also supplied a highly-efficient and convenient methodology for the research of tetW's dissemination within bacteria, i. e., several flanking sequences could be concisely obtained from one sample by using Tail-PCR program.

0037305754	Polymorphism of growth hormone gene in 12 pig breeds and its relationship with pig growth and carcass traits	The polymorphism of the growth hormone gene in 12 pig breeds (total n=475) was detected by PCR-Apa I -RFLP, and allele A (449 bp, 101 bp and 55 bp) or allele B (316 bp, 133 bp, 101 bp and 55 bp) were observed. In these pig breeds, we found that European pig breeds had high frequencies of allele B, while Chinese native pig breeds had high frequencies of allele A. In addition, the role of porcine GH was investigated in 117 Nanchang White pigs and 361 Large Yorkshire pigs. Eight traits about growth and carcass were recorded for analyzing associations between GH gene polymorphism and performance quantitative traits. In the Nanchang White pigs, no significant difference was observed between different genotypes and different growth and carcass traits. In Large Yorkshire pigs, those with BB genotype had more lean percentage than pigs with AA genotype (p<0.05). Based on these results, we conclude that the GH locus should be further investigated in commercial breeds to determine its suitability for use in marker-assisted selection programmes.

The genetic similarity coefficient of 24 pig beeds was calculated from AFLP data, UPGMA cluster analysis was also performed. The 12 primer combinations generated more than 1000 bands, of which 208 bands were polymorphic, 17.3 polymorphic markers were detected by one primer combination on the average. Thirteen putative breed specific bands were produced in the pooled DNA of 8 pig breeds. The cultivated pig breed and 4 exotic pig breeds were clustered into one group, while 19 Chinese native pig breeds were gathered into the other group in the UPGMA tree. The result indicated that AFLP analysis had high assay efficiency index (Ai) and provided a valuable tool for assaying genetic diversity and breed characterization in pigs. Chinese native pig breeds and exotic pig breeds show remarkable genetic differentiation, which had farther genetic relationships. Nanchang White pig and Large White pig, Yushan Black pig and Yanshan Black pig had intimate genetic relationships with each other respectively, which were consistent with its breeding history, geographical distribution and RAPD analysis results. In addition, the reasons for cluster results of some pig breeds from AFLP data were not consistent with morphology, geographical distribution and existing classification were discussed.

84866324489	Susceptibility towards Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli F4ac Diarrhea Is Governed by the MUC13 Gene in Pigs	Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) F4ac is a major determinant of diarrhea and mortality in neonatal and young pigs. Susceptibility to ETEC F4ac is governed by the intestinal receptor specific for the bacterium and is inherited as a monogenic dominant trait. To identify the receptor gene (F4acR), we first mapped the locus to a 7.8-cM region on pig chromosome 13 using a genome scan with 194 microsatellite markers. A further scan with high density markers on chromosome 13 refined the locus to a 5.7-cM interval. Recombination breakpoint analysis defined the locus within a 2.3-Mb region. Further genome-wide mapping using 39,720 informative SNPs revealed that the most significant markers were proximal to the MUC13 gene in the 2.3-Mb region. Association studies in a collection of diverse outbred populations strongly supported that MUC13 is the most likely responsible gene. We characterized the porcine MUC13 gene that encodes two transcripts: MUC13A and MUC13B. Both transcripts have the characteristic PTS regions of mucins that are enriched in distinct tandem repeats. MUC13B is predicated to be heavily O-glycosylated, forming the binding site of the bacterium; while MUC13A does not have the O-glycosylation binding site. Concordantly, 127 independent pigs homozygous for MUC13A across diverse breeds are all resistant to ETEC F4ac, and all 718 susceptible animals from the broad breed panel carry at least one MUC13B allele. Altogether, we conclude that susceptibility towards ETEC F4ac is governed by the MUC13 gene in pigs. The finding has an immediate translation into breeding practice, as it allows us to establish an efficient and accurate diagnostic test for selecting against susceptible animals. Moreover, the finding improves our understanding of mucins that play crucial roles in defense against enteric pathogens. It revealed, for the first time, the direct interaction between MUC13 and enteric bacteria, which is poorly understood in mammals. © 2012 Ren et al.

84869781314	Nucleotide variability and linkage disequilibrium patterns in the porcine MUC4 gene	Background: MUC4 is a type of membrane anchored glycoprotein and serves as the major constituent of mucus that covers epithelial surfaces of many tissues such as trachea, colon and cervix. MUC4 plays important roles in the lubrication and protection of the surface epithelium, cell proliferation and differentiation, immune response, cell adhesion and cancer development. To gain insights into the evolution of the porcine MUC4 gene, we surveyed the nucleotide variability and linkage disequilibrium (LD) within this gene in Chinese indigenous breeds and Western commercial breeds.Results: A total of 53 SNPs covering the MUC4 gene were genotyped on 5 wild boars and 307 domestic pigs representing 11 Chinese breeds and 3 Western breeds. The nucleotide variability, haplotype phylogeny and LD extent of MUC4 were analyzed in these breeds. Both Chinese and Western breeds had considerable nucleotide diversity at the MUC4 locus. Western pig breeds like Duroc and Large White have comparable nucleotide diversity as many of Chinese breeds, thus artificial selection for lean pork production have not reduced the genetic variability of MUC4 in Western commercial breeds. Haplotype phylogeny analyses indicated that MUC4 had evolved divergently in Chinese and Western pigs. The dendrogram of genetic differentiation between breeds generally reflected demographic history and geographical distribution of these breeds. LD patterns were unexpectedly similar between Chinese and Western breeds, in which LD usually extended less than 20 kb. This is different from the presumed high LD extent (more than 100 kb) in Western commercial breeds. The significant positive Tajima'D, and Fu and Li's D statistics in a few Chinese and Western breeds implied that MUC4 might undergo balancing selection in domestic breeds. Nevertheless, we cautioned that the significant statistics could be upward biased by SNP ascertainment process.Conclusions: Chinese and Western breeds have similar nucleotide diversity but evolve divergently in the MUC4 region. Western breeds exhibited unusual low LD extent at the MUC4 locus, reflecting the complexity of nucleotide variability of pig genome. The finding suggests that high density (e.g. 1SNP/10 kb) markers are required to capture the underlying causal variants at such regions. © 2012 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

We found that all breeds, especially Duroc pigs, have high frequencies of favourable alleles for lean production and stress resistance at the IGF2 and RYR1 loci. However, all breeds have low frequencies of the diarrhea-resistant allele of FUT1, indicating that multigenerational selection is required for E. coli F18

84878384825	Genome-Wide Association Study of Meat Quality Traits in a White Duroc×Erhualian F2 Intercross and Chinese Sutai Pigs	Thousands of QTLs for meat quality traits have been identified by linkage mapping studies, but most of them lack precise position or replication between populations, which hinder their application in pig breeding programs. To localize QTLs for meat quality traits to precise genomic regions, we performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study using the Illumina PorcineSNP60K Beadchip in two swine populations: 434 Sutai pigs and 933 F2 pigs from a White Duroc×Erhualian intercross. Meat quality traits, including pH, color, drip loss, moisture content, protein content and intramuscular fat content (IMF), marbling and firmness scores in the M. longissimus (LM) and M. semimembranosus (SM) muscles, were recorded on the two populations. In total, 127 chromosome-wide significant SNPs for these traits were identified. Among them, 11 SNPs reached genome-wise significance level, including 1 on SSC3 for pH, 1 on SSC3 and 3 on SSC15 for drip loss, 3 (unmapped) for color a*, and 2 for IMF each on SSC9 and SSCX. Except for 11 unmapped SNPs, 116 significant SNPs fell into 28 genomic regions of approximately 10 Mb or less. Most of these regions corresponded to previously reported QTL regions and spanned smaller intervals than before. The loci on SSC3 and SSC7 appeared to have pleiotropic effects on several related traits. Besides them, a few QTL signals were replicated between the two populations. Further, we identified thirteen new candidate genes for IMF, marbling and firmness, on the basis of their positions, functional annotations and reported expression patterns. The findings will contribute to further identification of the causal mutation underlying these QTLs and future marker-assisted selection in pigs. © 2013 Ma et al.

84884252739	The G32E Functional Variant Reduces Activity of PPARD by Nuclear Export and Post-Translational Modification in Pigs	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARD) is a crucial and multifaceted determinant of diverse biological functions including lipid metabolism, embryonic development, inflammatory response, wound healing and cancer. Recently, we proposed a novel function of porcine PPARD (sPPARD) in external ear development. A missense mutation (G32E) in an evolutionary conservative domain of sPPARD remarkably increases external ear size in pigs. Here, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism of the causal mutation at the cellular level. Using a luciferase reporter system, we showed that the G32E substitution reduced transcription activity of sPPARD in a ligand-dependent manner. By comparison of the subcellular localization of wild-type and mutated sPPARD in both PK-15 cells and pinna cartilage-derived primary chondrocytes, we found that the G32E substitution promoted CRM-1 mediated nuclear exportation of sPPARD. With the surface plasmon resonance technology, we further revealed that the G32E substitution had negligible effect on its ligand binding affinity. Finally, we used co-immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays to show that the G32E substitution greatly reduced ubiquitination level by blocking ubiquitination of the crucial A/B domain and consequently decreased transcription activity of sPPARD. Taken together, our findings strongly support that G32E is a functional variant that plays a key role in biological activity of sPPARD, which advances our understanding of the underlying mechanism of sPPARD G32E for ear size in pigs. © 2013 Duan et al.

0040671933	Research on genetic variation of heart fatty acid-binding protein gene in ten pig breeds	The genetic variation of heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) gene in 561 pigs including Duroc, Landrace, Large Yorkshire, Nanchang white pig, Erhualian, Meishan, Yushan black pig, Leping spotted pig, Jinhua black head-hind pig and Shanggao black head-hind pig were detected by PCR-RFLP with Hinf I, Hae III and Msp I. The results showed as follows: (1) Nanchang white pig presented only HH genotype while other breeds varied at the Hinf I -RFLP site; (2) The exotic breeds including Duroc, Landrace, Large Yorkshire and the native breed Nanchang white pig were proved to be polymorphic while the five Chinese local breeds presented no variation at the Hae III -RFLP site; (3) Among the tested breeds only Duroc presented variation at the Msp I -RFLP site. It is noted that all the Chinese local breeds present as AADD - genotypes.

84888773216	Genetic dissection of blood lipid traits by integrating genome-wide association study and gene expression profiling in a porcine model	Background: Serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) are highly heritable traits that are used clinically to evaluate risk for cardiovascular disease in humans. In this study, we applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 1,075 pigs from two populations and gene expression studies on 497 liver samples to dissect the genetic basis of serum lipids in a pig model.Results: We totally identified 8, 5, 2 and 3 genomic loci harboring 109 SNPs that were significantly associated with LDL-C, TC, TG and the ratio of HDL-C/LDL-C in two experimental populations, respectively.

84899930722	Enhancement of nystatin production by redirecting precursor fluxes after disruption of the tetramycin gene from Streptomyces ahygroscopicus	Complete and independent tetramycin and nystatin gene clusters containing varying lengths of type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes were isolated from Streptomyces ahygroscopicus, a producer of tetramycin (a tetraene) in large amounts and nystatin A1 (a heptaene) in small amounts. Tetramycin was similar to pimaricin, and nystatin A1 was similar to amphotericin. All these polyene macrolide antibiotics possessed the same macrolactone ring biosynthesized from coenzyme A precursors by PKSs but had different number of atoms in the macrolactone ring and side groups. Because tetramycin and nystatin shared limited coenzyme A precursors in the same producer organism, blocking the consumption of precursors in tetramycin pathway may increase the coenzyme A pool. Thus, we genetically manipulated the tetramycin PKS to enhance nystatin production. The type I PKS ttmS1 gene mutant abolished production of tetramycin and had a beneficial effect on the production of nystatin A1. For the mutant, the yield of nystatin A1 was increased by 10-fold compared to that of the wild-type. Thus, deletion of the tetramycin pathway redirected precursor metabolic fluxes and provided an easy genetic approach to manipulate organisms and to increase production levels of a precise target. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

84908075417	Population history and genomic signatures for high-altitude adaptation in tibetan pigs	Background: The Tibetan pig is one of domestic animals indigenous to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Several geographically isolated pig populations are distributed throughout the Plateau. It remained an open question if these populations have experienced different demographic histories and have evolved independent adaptive loci for the harsh environment of the Plateau. To address these questions, we herein investigated ~ 40,000 genetic variants across the pig genome in a broad panel of 678 individuals from 5 Tibetan geographic populations and 34 lowland breeds.Results: Using a series of population genetic analyses, we show that Tibetan pig populations have marked genetic differentiations. Tibetan pigs appear to be 3 independent populations corresponding to the Tibetan, Gansu and Sichuan & Yunnan locations. Each population is more genetically similar to its geographic neighbors than to any of the other Tibetan populations. By applying a locus-specific branch length test, we identified both population-specific and -shared candidate genes under selection in Tibetan pigs. These genes, such as PLA2G12A, RGCC, C9ORF3, GRIN2B, GRID1 and EPAS1, are involved in high-altitude physiology including angiogenesis, pulmonary hypertension, oxygen intake, defense response and erythropoiesis. A majority of these genes have not been implicated in previous studies of highlanders and high-altitude animals.Conclusion: Tibetan pig populations have experienced substantial genetic differentiation. Historically, Tibetan pigs likely had admixture with neighboring lowland breeds. During the long history of colonization in the Plateau, Tibetan pigs have developed a complex biological adaptation mechanism that could be different from that of Tibetans and other animals. Different Tibetan pig populations appear to have both distinct and convergent adaptive loci for the harsh environment of the Plateau.
