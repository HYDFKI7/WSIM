20444466950	Analysis of transient waveform based on combined short time Fourier Transform and wavelet transform	Transient harmonics can be analyzed by short time Fourier Transform (STFT) and wavelet transform respectively. However, there are disadvantages in both of them. The former cannot have favorable result except for having a suitable window, and the latter cannot acquire single harmonic frequency and its amplitude. After comparing the advantages and disadvantages of STFT and wavelet transform which are used to analyze signal of transient harmonic in power system, combining their merits, a novel STFT based on the special frequency band is proposed in this paper. Multi-resolution analysis is used to detect the fault time and determine the main frequency range of transient signal. Then the central point and proper width of window of STFT can be obtained. Consequently the accuracy and efficiency of STFT can be improved greatly, frequency components and its amplitudes of transient signal can be obtained accurately and quickly by this method. An on-line system to inspect and analyze transient waveform is designed based on LabVIEW, through which the feasibility and the accurateness of this method have been verified. © 2004 IEEE.

22844436757	J-lossless conjugated design for synchronous multirate sampled-data system H-infinity control	In the illumination of the causal constraint problem for lifted synchronous multirate controller, this article proposes a J-lossless conjugator design approach by making use of the properties of the J-lossless conjugator. First, lift the synchronous multirate sampled-data system (SMRSDS) and deal with it by equivalent discretization. Now the H-infinity control of SMRSDS is equivalent to that of the system with a causal constraint lifted controller. Second, the H-infinity control of discrete system is transformed to the solution of a conjugator which only needs to solve the eigenvalue problem and a Lyapunov equation. At the same time, the causal constraint of the lifted controller is changed to the causal constraint of a random element in BH-infinity. Finally the parameterized forms of the controller are obtained, which satisfy the causal constraint and the corresponding closed-loop system. It has the characteristics of simple design procedure and less computation quantity in comparison with the routine theories.

The experiments were focused on the effect of leading-edge cross section on vortex structures for 50° sweep delta wings and on the maximum sweep angle at which the dual vortex structure exists. It is obtained that the dual vortex structures are sensitive to the dye injection location, and such structure can be observed at sweep angle as large as 64°. Meanwhile, the experimental results indicate that the leading edge cross-section significantly influences the vortex breakdown position and the trajectory of the vortex core. In comparison with the windward beveled leading edge, the leeward beveled one is easy to generate the dual vortex structure over the 50° sweep delta wing, to delay the primary vortex breakdown, and to cause the primary vortex core close to the wing surface, which are benefit to improve the aerodynamic characteristics of the delta wing.

40049109544	Open wireless sensor network platform-OpenWSN	Most of the current WSN research platforms are based on Mica nodes and TinyOS. However, they're difficult to integrate with the existing mature source codes and difficult to port to other platforms. These micro-controller based solutions are also quite weak to fulfill high performance tasks such as image processing and PAN coordination. Furthermore, the new invented nesC language also holdback its acceptance among industry application developers. Considering the above shortcomings, an ARM7 based powerful WSN research platform, named OpenWSN, is designed and implemented. OpenWSN adopts bus architecture to connect different modules in hardware design and uses layered OOD/OOP in software design. The component-based and service-based architecture makes it easy to integrate with current mature resources. The node has 32KB SRAM and up to 512 KB flash memory. It can run between ll-60MHz and using DMA to move data inside memory. These features enable OpenWSN run much faster than general Mica or Telos nodes. The power consumption is a bit higher than Mica's Atmegal28L solution because ARM7 processor consumes more energy than Atmegal28L micro processor. However, due to its high performance, OpenWSN node can finish more tasks and spend more time in sleep status. This in turn decreases the power consumption. The experiment verifies the solution and confirms OpenWSN ' s effectiveness in high performance applications such as vibration measurements.

The results indicate that the lift characteristics of FSW outweigh that of backswept wing at high angle of attack; FSW has higher stalling angle and keeps higher lift coefficient in a broader range of angle of attack near stalling angle, which is improved by canard wing located farther away from the main wing. A coupled canard wing can increase the lift coefficient of overall configuration. Meanwhile Canard-forward-swept wing has an excellent maneuverability.

Direct-reaching condition(DRC) is the basis of using DRSMC to synthesize a SMC system. A DRSMC system is composed of a command mode model and an on-off type DRSMC model. Different from the traditional reaching condition, the control which satisfies the DRC can guarantee all phase trajectories from the neighborhood of sliding mode to direct reach the nearby branch of the sliding mode and then go to zero state. Therefore the state transition process will be fast and monotonous. The DRSMC was applied to an example system and was simulated.

In the first stage, regarded the equivalent injections at the boundary busses and equivalent admittance between the boundary busses as the equivalent parameters, the simplified ward equivalent circuit of two-port external network was constructed and N-time least squares estimation model of equivalent parameters was built. In the second stage, the EWM was formed by changing the equivalent injections at the boundary busses into their equivalent branches. Then least squares estimation model of EWM's parameters was established, considering the relations of the two equivalent circuit parameters. Finally, Gauss-Newton method was applied to get the equivalent parameters of the first and second stage equivalent parameters, and make the latter as the equivalent parameters of the external network. Owing to the restriction effect of the first stage equivalent parameters, the coupling effect among the EWM parameters decreases and the accuracy of equivalent parameter estimations is guaranteed.

80054682414	Line parameter estimation method with per unit length parameter varibles	Resistance, reactance, and susceptance are estimated as independent variables in the conventional methods of parameter estimation. However, because they have a great difference in value, their estimation errors are inconsistent, especially the errors of small impedance are usually very large. Based on the length and the line parameters per unit length, a new line parameter estimation model is proposed. In this new model, state variables are multi-period voltage amplitude and phase angle at two ends of the line, and parameter variables are the parameters per unit length and the length. Because of introducing the length as the public variables of resistance, reactance and susceptance, the influence of line parameters on power flow is highlighted, so the consistency of line parameter estimation error can be guaranteed, and large estimation error of small impedance which appears in conventional models can be voided in the new model. Besides, the chaos quantum immune algorithm is presented to solve the parameter estimation model. It has the advantages of global optimality and stability.

84873245113	Dynamic optimization model of AGC Strategy Under CPS for interconnected power system	Automatic generation control (AGC) is an important domain in the unit scheduling and control of the power system. The pros and cons of its control strategy directly determine its effect. To address the problem of the inadequate effect of the traditional AGC strategy, a dynamic optimization model of an AGC strategy under CPS (DOMAGCSC) for interconnected power systems is proposed in this paper to improve the performance of AGC. The optimal CPS indicator and the minimum ancillary service cost are considered as objective functions. The influence of frequency change in the optimization cycle, the characteristic of minimum duration time of unit adjustment, and other power system constraints are considered in the DOMAGCSC, which is a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Then, a multi-objective immunity evolutionary programming (MIEP) algorithm is presented to solve the DOMAGCSC. Numerical tests on two different power systems are implemented to examine the proposed model by MIEP. The simulation results show that the proposed DOMAGCSC could optimize and improve the efficiency of AGC through a coordinative control of hydro and thermal units as well as of fast and slow units between multi-control cycles. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

This theory ensured that before and after the equivalent, not only the power flow states of internal network kept equal, but also the following sensitivities remained consistent: non-generator node voltages with regard to generator node voltages and non-generator node voltages with regard to non-generator injected currents. Generally, the existing equivalent methods only considered the consistency of power flow states, so the new theory was stricter and had more accurate results of external network static equivalent.

The electrical distance between two Mvar source nodes is defined based on the sensitivity of voltage to reactive power injection, and the agglomerate hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied to partition the Mvar source nodes. Then the short-circuit impedance distance between multiple Mvar source nodes and a single load node is defined, and the mapping between load nodes and Mvar sources partitions is realized by minimizing the short-circuit impedance distances. With the presented method, not only the Mvar source nodes within a short electrical distance from each other, but also the load nodes and the multiple Mvar source nodes having a strong control relation can be clustered into the same partition. The other advantage with the method is that the partition is independent of the power flow state.
