84947920788	Blind threshold signatures based on discrete logarithm	In this paper, we propose two group-oriented (t, n) blind threshold signature schemes based on the discrete logarithm problem. By these schemes, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the group to sign blind threshold signatures. In our schemes, the size of a threshold signature is the same as the size of an individual signature and the signature verification process is simplified by means of a group public key. Our proposed schemes do not require the assistance of a mutually trusted authority. In addition each signer can select his own private key and the group public key is determined by all the members. The security of our schemes rely on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithm.

9744242854	An efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol	For the purpose of deterring unauthorized duplication and distribution of multimedia contents, a seller may insert a unique digital watermark into each copy of the multimedia contents to be sold. When an illegal replica is found in the market sometime later, the seller can determine the responsible distributor by examining the watermark embedded. However, the accusation against the charged distributor, who was the buyer in some earlier transaction, is objectionable because the seller also has access to the watermarked copies and, hence, is able to release such a replica on her own. In this paper, a watermarking protocol is proposed to avoid such difficulties, known as the customer's right problem, in the phase of arbitration. The proposed watermarking protocol also provides a fix to Memon and Wong's scheme by solving the unbinding problem. In addition, the buyer is no longer required to contact the watermark certification authority during transactions, and the anonymity of the buyer can be retained through a trusted third party. The result is an efficient and anonymous buyer-seller watermarking protocol. © 2004 IEEE.

0030687205	A secure and practical electronic voting scheme for real world environments	In this paper, we propose a practical and secure electronic voting scheme which meets the requirements of large scale general elections. This scheme involves voters, the administrator or so called the government and some scrutineers. In our scheme, a voter only has to communicate with the administrator three times and it ensures independence among voters without the need of any global computation. This scheme uses the threshold cryptosystem to guarantee the fairness among the candidate's campaign and to provide mechanism for achieving the function that any voter can make an open objection to the tally if his vote has not been published. This scheme preserves the privacy of a voter against the administrator, scrutineers, and other voters. Completeness, robustness, and verifiability of the voting process are ensured and hence no one can produce a false tally, corrupt or disrupt the election.

0030410935	A collision-free secret ballot protocol for computerized general elections	In secret ballot protocols, the unique voting property is crucial since without it a voter may vote more than once or his ballot may collide with others and be discarded by the authority. In this paper we present a collision-free secret ballot protocol based on the uniquely blind signature technique. Our proposed scheme can be used to hold large-scale general elections because it ensures independence among voters without the need for any global computation. This scheme preserves the privacy of a voter against the authority and other voters. Robustness is ensured in that no subset of voters can corrupt or disrupt the election. The verifiability of this protocol ensures that the authority cannot present a false tally without being caught. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0031366862	Secure rewarding schemes	In this paper, we propose a secure rewarding scheme. In the scheme, a reward provider publishes a problem, and provides a reward for a person who can supply him a satisfactory solution of the problem. The first qualified claimant with satisfactory solution of the problem is selected to obtain the reward. The selected claimant can obtain the reward from the reward provider without revealing his identity. Nobody except the selected claimant can get the reward, and the provider cannot decline the selected claimant his entitled reward. In addition, we also propose another secure rewarding scheme with two-way untraceability to protect the privacy of the reward provider as well.

0032066059	Low-computation partially blind signatures for electronic cash	In a secure partially blind signature scheme, the signer assures that the blind signatures issued by him contains the information he desires. The techniques make it possible to minimize the unlimited growth of the bank's database which storing all spent electronic cash in an anonymous electronic cash system. In this paper we propose an efficient partially blind signature scheme for electronic cash. In our scheme, only several modular additions and modular multiplications are required for a signature requester to obtain and verify a signature. It turns out that the proposed scheme is suitable for mobile clients and smartcard applications because no time-consuming computations are required, such as modular exponentiation and inverse computations. Comparing with the existing blind signature schemes proposed in the literatures, our method reduces the amount of computations for signature requesters by almost 98%.

0032066843	Multi-recastable ticket schemes for electronic voting	Multi-recast techniques make it possible for a voter to participate in a sequence of different designated votings by using only one ticket. In a multi-recastable ticket scheme for electronic voting, every voter of a group can obtain an m-castable ticket (m-ticket), and through the m-ticket, the voter can participate in a sequence of m different designated votings held in this group. The m-ticket contains all possible intentions of the voter in the sequence of votings, and in each of the m votings, a voter casts his vote by just making appropriate modifications to his m-ticket. The authority cannot produce both the opposite version of a vote cast by a voter in one voting and the succeeding uncast votes of the voter. Only one round of registration action is required for a voter to request an rn-ticket from the authority. Moreover, the size of such an m-ticket is not larger than that of an ordinary vote. It turns out that the proposed scheme greatly reduces the network traffic between the voters and the authority during the registration stages in a sequence of different votings, for example, the proposed method reduces the communication traffic by almost 80% for a sequence of 5 votings and by nearly 90% for a sequence of 10 votings.

0032182084	A universal single-authority election system	SUMMARY Privacy, voter uncoercibility, collision freedom, verifiability, and tally correctness are essential properties of modern electronic election systems. None of the single-authority election systems proposed in the literatures achieves all the above five properties. In this paper we propose a universal single-authority election system that satisfies the five properties. In particular, the privacy of each voter is protected against the authority and other voters, and no voter can coerce any other voter into changing the value of his vote in our proposed system. We also show that it is impossible for a collision-free single-authority election system to possess the voter uncoercibility and authority uncoercibility at the same time.

0032628039	Partially blind threshold signatures based on discrete logarithm	In this paper, we propose a group-oriented partially blind (t, n) threshold signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem. By the scheme, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the group to sign partially blind threshold signatures, which can be used in anonymous digital e-cash systems or secure voting schemes. By our proposed scheme, the growth of the bank's database was successfully minimized and the issue of e-coins is controlled by several authorities. Our proposed scheme can greatly simplify the voting processes when several elections are to be held in a short period of time by embedding information about each election in a partially blind threshold signature. In our scheme, the size of a partially blind threshold signature is the same as that of an individual partially blind signature and the signature verification process is simplified by a group public key. The security of our scheme relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithm. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

23944468566	An on-line page-structure approximation scheme for Web proxies	To render a Web page, a browser must first download an HTML document, parse it, and then issue a sequence of additional requests to fetch the embedded objects according to the content of the HTML document. Therefore, it should be straightforward for Web proxies to accurately predict future client requests by considering the characteristics of such regular behavior. However, the strong bindings between embedded objects and their containing documents are often ignored by modern Web proxies because there still exists no efficient solution for Web proxies to obtain the knowledge of page structures without performing the computation-intensive operations of HTML parsing. In this paper, we propose an effective and low-overhead scheme for Web proxies to approximate page structures and refine the approximation as new client requests arrive. The results of simulation show that the approximation converges quickly and reaches high accuracy after a relatively small number of incoming requests have been processed. © 2005 IEEE.

25644441773	The impact of network variabilities on TCP clocking schemes	TCP employs a self-clocking scheme that times the sending of packets. In that, the data packets are sent in a burst when the returning acknowledgement packets are received. This self-clocking scheme (also known as ack-clocking) is deemed a key factor to the the burstiness of TCP traffic and the source of various performance problems - high packet loss, long delay, and high delay jitter. Previous work has suggested contradictively the effectiveness of TCP Pacing as a remedy to alleviate the traffic burstiness. In this paper, we analyze systematically and in more robust experiments the impact of network variabilities on the behavior of TCP clocking schemes. We find that 1) aggregated pacing traffic could be burstier than aggregated ack-clocking traffic. Physical explanation and experimental simulations are provided to support this argument. 2) The round-trip time heterogeneity and flow multiplexing significantly influence the behaviors of both ack-clocking and pacing schemes. Evaluating the performance of clocking schemes without considering these effects is prone to inconsistent results. 3) Pacing outperforms ack-clocking in more realistic settings from the traffic burstiness point of view. © 2005 IEEE.

2942679015	A remote control scheme for ubiquitous personal computing	In the schemes designed for ubiquitous computing, remote access to private data is generally achieved by requiring users to deposit the data on certain always-on-line servers in the network infrastructure. However, when the data to be accessed remotely is somewhat sensitive, as implied by many applications of personal computing, users may prefer to warehouse the data in their residences rather than in some public places. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed to realize personal computing ubiquitously by satisfying such demand. The proposed scheme employs home-automation techniques to grant properly authenticated users remote access to the data stored somewhere off the infrastructure (e.g., their personal workstations) while avoiding the expense of deploying high-availability servers at home. It also provides three kinds of authentication mechanisms and hence allows users to choose among different levels of the tradeoff between security and ubiquity, providing a complete solution for ubiquitous personal computing.

29844448481	Game traffic analysis: An MMORPG perspective	Online gaming is one of the most profitable businesses over the Internet. Among all genres of the online games, the popularity of the MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) is especially prominent in Asia. Opting for a better understanding of the game traffic and the economic well being of the Internet, we analyze a 1,356-million-packet trace from a sizeable MMORPG, ShenZhou Online. This work is, as far as we know, the first formal analysis on the MMORPG server traces. We find that the MMORPG and FPS (First-Person Shooting) games are similar in that they both generate small packets and require low bandwidths. In particular, the bandwidth requirement of MMORPG is even lower due to the less real-time game play. More distinctive are the strong periodicity, temporal locality, and irregularity observed in the MMORPG traffic. The periodicity is due to a common practice in game implementation, where the game state updates are accumulated within a fixed time window before transmission. The temporal locality in the game traffic is largely due to the game nature where one action leads to another. The irregularity, particular unique in MMORPG traffic, is due to the diversity of game design where the user behavior can be drastically different depending on the quest at hand. Copyright 2005 ACM.

If the security policies cannot meet a set of consistent requirements, we said there are policy conflicts. In this paper, we analyze all situations which could possibly lead to a policy conflict and try to resolve all of them. We induce only two situations which could cause conflicts and also propose an algorithm to automatically generate conflict-free policies which satisfy all requirements. We also implement our algorithm and compare the results of simulation with the other approaches and show that it outperforms existing approaches in the literature. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2005.

33646728730	A clustering and traffic-redistribution scheme for high-performance IPsec VPNs	CPE-based IPsec VPNs have been widely used to provide secure private communication across the Internet. As the bandwidth of WAN links keeps growing, the bottleneck in a typical deployment of CPE-based IPsec VPNs has moved from the last-mile connections to the customer-edge security gateways. In this paper, we propose a clustering scheme to scale the throughput as required by CPE-based IPsec VPNs. The proposed scheme groups multiple security gateways into a cluster using a transparent self-dispatching technique and allows as many gateways to be added as necessary until the resulting throughput is again limited by the bandwidth of the last-mile connections. It also includes a flow-migration mechanism to keep the load of the gateways balanced. The results of the performance evaluation confirm that the clustering technique and the traffic-redistribution mechanism together create a transparent, adaptive, and highly scalable solution for building high-performance IPsec VPNs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33646735175	Secure multicast using proxy encryption	In a secure multicast communication environment, only valid members belong to the multicast group could decrypt the data. In many previous researches, there is one "group key" shared by all group members. However, this incurs the so-called "1 affects n problem," that is, an action of one member affects the whole group. We believe this is the source of scalability problems. Moreover, from the administrative perspective, it is desired to confine the impacts of changing membership events in a local area. In this paper, we propose a new secure multicast architecture without using a group key. We exploit a cryptographic primitive "proxy encryption." It allows routers to convert a ciphertext encrypted under a key to a ciphertext encrypted under another key, with-out revealing the secret key and the plaintext. By giving proper keys to intermediate routers, routers could provide separation between subgroups. Therefore the goals of scalability and containment are achieved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

33747873700	Game traffic analysis: An MMORPG perspective	Online gaming is one of the most profitable businesses on the Internet. Of all the genres of online games, MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) have become the most popular among network gamers, and now attract millions of users who play in an evolving virtual world simultaneously over the Internet. To gain a better understanding of game traffic and contribute to the economic well-being of the Internet, we analyze a 1356-million-packet trace from a sizeable MMORPG called ShenZhou Online. This work is, as far as we know, the first formal analysis of MMORPG server traces. We find that MMORPG and FPS (First-Person Shooting) games are similar in that they both generate small packets and require low bandwidths. In practice, the bandwidth requirement of MMORPGs is the lower of the two due to less real-time game playing. More distinctive features are the strong periodicity, temporal locality, irregularity, and self-similarity observed in MMORPG traffic. The periodicity is due to a common practice in game implementation, where game state updates are accumulated within a fixed time window before transmission. The temporal locality in game traffic is largely due to the game's nature, whereby one action leads to another. The irregularity, which is unique to MMORPG traffic, is due to the diversity of the game's design so that the behavior of users can vary drastically, depending on the quest at hand. The self-similarity of the aggregate traffic is due to the heavy-tailed active/idle activities of individual players. Moreover, we show that the arrival of game sessions within 1 h can be modelled by a Poisson model, while the duration of game sessions is heavy-tailed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

33748933704	Analysis and evaluation of a multiple gateway traffic-distribution scheme for gateway clusters	Next-generation Internet gateways are expected to deal with higher volume of network traffic and also perform more sophisticated tasks besides packet forwarding. As the scale-up approach does not escape from the tradeoff between functionality and performance, architectural improvements such as clustering become necessary in the design of future Internet gateways. In this paper, we investigate different clustering architectures for high-performance, feature-rich Internet gateways and formally define the optimization problem behind these architectures as Multiple Gateway Traffic-Distribution Problem, both in a discrete and a continuous form. In addition to proposing various algorithms that solve the problem exactly and approximately, we also develop an on-line, self-adjusting scheme based on the solution algorithms. The numerical results of simulation suggest that the proposed approximate solution algorithms are effective and efficient, and the derived adaptive scheme is able to make the best decision on traffic distribution when dealing with the dynamic nature of network traffic in practice. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33750086955	Design implications of social interaction in online games	While psychologists analyze network game-playing behavior in terms of players' social interaction and experience, understanding user behavior is equally important to network researchers, because how players act determines how well systems, such as MMORPGs, perform. To gain a better understanding of patterns of player interaction and their implications for game design, we analyze a 1,356-million-packet trace of ShenZhou Online, a mid-sized commercial MMORPG. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to put forward architectural design recommendations for online games based on analysis of player interaction. We find that the dispersion of players in a virtual world is heavy-tailed, which implies that static and fixed-size partitioning of game worlds is inadequate. Neighbors and teammates tend to be closer to each other in network topology. This property is an advantage, because message delivery between the hosts of interacting players can be faster than between those of unrelated players. In addition, the property can make game playing fairer, since interacting players tend to have similar latencies to their servers. We also find that participants who have a higher degree of social interaction tend to play much longer, and players who are closer in network topology tend to team up for longer periods. This suggests that game designers could increase the "stickiness" of games by supporting, or even forcing, team playing. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.

33750327181	Quantifying Skype user satisfaction	The success of Skype has inspired a generation of peer-to-peer-based solutions for satisfactory real-time multimedia services over the Internet. However, fundamental questions, such as whether VoIP services like Skype are good enough in terms of user satisfaction, have not been formally addressed. One of the major challenges lies in the lack of an easily accessible and objective index to quantify the degree of user satisfaction. In this work, we propose a model, geared to Skype, but generalizable to other VoIP services, to quantify VoIP user satisfaction based on a rigorous analysis of the call duration from actual Skype traces. The User Satisfaction Index (USI) derived from the model is unique in that 1) it is composed by objective source- and network-level metrics, such as the bit rate, bit rate jitter, and round-trip time, 2) unlike speech quality measures based on voice signals, such as the PESQ model standardized by ITU-T, the metrics are easily accessible and computable for real-time adaptation, and 3) the model development only requires network measurements, i.e., no user surveys or voice signals are necessary. Our model is validated by an independent set of metrics that quantifies the degree of user interaction from the actual traces. Copyright 2006 ACM.

33750698272	How sensitive are online gamers to network quality?	The effect of network quality on the performance of online games, is discussed. As games are played in a controlled network environment in which the gaming experience of online gamers is graded either subjectively or objectively, this method of grading is unable to determine the player's reaction to game quality in real life due to low quality of service (QoS)-tolerance. Diminished network lags causes decrease in the feeling of involvement in the virtual world by online gamers. The analysis of mutilate online role-playing game Shen Zhou Online developed by UserJoy technology shows that that game-playing time should be shorter to avoid low network quality. Online game service providers need to monitor network conditions between servers and customers networks for detecting real time problems before customer complain.

33845563260	Mitigating active attacks towards client networks using the bitmap filter	With the emergence of active worms, the targets of attacks have been moved from well-known Internet servers to generic Internet hosts, and since the rate at which patches can be applied is always much slower than the spread of a worm, an Internet worm can usually attack or infect millions of hosts in a short time. It is difficult to eliminate Internet attacks globally; thus, protecting client networks from being attacked or infected is a relatively critical issue. In this paper, we propose a method that protects client networks from being attacked by people who try to scan, attack, or infect hosts in local networks via unpatched vulnerabilities. Based on the symmetry of network traffic in both temporal and spatial domains, a bitmap filter is installed at the entry point of a client network to filter out possible attack traffic. Our evaluation shows that with a small amount of memory (less than 1 megabyte), more than 95% of attack traffic can be filtered out in a small- or medium-scale client network. © 2006 IEEE.

34247362459	A distributed key assignment protocol for secure multicast based on proxy cryptography	A secure multicast- framework should only allow authorized members of a group to decrypt received messages; usually one "group key" is shared by all approved members. However, this raises the problem of "one affects all," whereby the actions of one member affect the whole group. Many researchers solve the problem by dividing a group into several subgroups, but most existing solutions require a centralized trusted controller to coordinate cryptographic keys for subgroups. We believe this is a constraint on network scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to solve key management problems in multicast networks. Our contribution is three-fold: 1) We exploit the ElGarnal cryptosystem and propose the idea of key composition; 2) A distributed key assignment protocol is proposed to eliminate the need for a centralized trust controller in a secure multicast network that leverages proxy cryptography; and 3) We adopt a hybrid encryption technique that makes our framework more efficient and practical. Comparison with similar frameworks shows the proposed scheme is efficient in both time and space complexity. In addition, costs of most protocol operations are bounded by constants regardless of a group's size and the degree of transit nodes. Copyright 2006 ACM.

By extending the boundary of cluster file systems to the customers' premise, it is now possible to provide home users efficient, dependable, and responsive network storage. In this paper, we identify the primary issue of network latency when implementing cluster file systems across the last miles, and propose a solution by replacing the round-based data transmission protocol of Coda file system with a rate-based one. The performance evaluation of the prototype system shows significant improvements of both throughput and response time for file-transfer operations, especially under high network latency. The result is a latency-resistant cluster file system.

34547223440	Identifying MMORPG bots: A traffic analysis approach	MMORPGs have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite their success, one of MMORPG's greatest challenges is the increasing use of game bots, i.e., auto-playing game clients. The use of game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem, we analyze the traffic generated by human players vs. game bots and propose solutions to automatically identify game bots.Taking Ragnarok Online, one of the most popular MMOGs, as our subject, we study the traffic generated by mainstream game bots and human players. We find that their traffic is distinguishable by: 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to network conditions. We propose four strategies and two integrated schemes to identify bots. For our data sets, the conservative scheme completely avoids making false accusations against bona fide players, while the progressive scheme tracks game bots down more aggressively. Finally, we show that the proposed methods are generalizable to other games and robust against counter-measures from bot developers. © 2006 ACM.

34547228149	An empirical evaluation of TCP performance in online games	A fundamental design question to ask in the development of a network game is - -Which transport protocol should be used - -TCP, UDP, or some other protocols? Seeking an objective answer to the choice of communication protocol for MMORPGs, we assess whether TCP, a popular choice, is suitable for MMORPGs based on empirical evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first evaluation of transport protocol performance using real-life game traces.We analyze a 1, 356-million-packet trace from ShenZhou Online, a TCP-based, commercial, mid-sized MMORPG. Our analysis indicates that TCP is unwieldy and inappropriate for MMORPGs. This is due to four distinctive characteristics of MMORPG traffic: 1) tiny packets, 2) low packet rate, 3) application-limited traffic generation, and 4) bidirectional traffic. We show that because TCP was originally designed for unidirectional and network-limited bulk data transfers, it cannot adapt well to MMORPG traffic. In particular, the window-based congestion control and the fast retransmit algorithm for loss recovery are ineffective. Furthermore, TCP is overkill, as not every game packet needs to be transmitted in a reliably and orderly manner. We also show that the degraded network performance did impact users' willingness to continue a game. Finally, we discuss guidelines in designing transport protocols for online games. © 2006 ACM.

36049025297	Bounding peer-to-peer upload traffic in client networks	Peer-to-peer technique has now become one of the major techniques to exchange digital content between peers of the same interest. However, as the amount of peer-to-peer traffic increases, a network administrator would like to control the network resources consumed by peer-to-peer applications. Due to the use of random ports and protocol encryption, it is hard to identify and apply proper control policies to peer-to-peer traffic. How do we properly bound the peer-to-peer traffic and prevent it from consuming all the available network resources? In this paper, we propose an algorithm that tries to approximately bound the network resources consumed by peer-to-peer traffic without examining packet payloads. Our methodology especially focuses on upload traffic for that the upload bandwidth for an ISP are usually more precious than download bandwidth. The method is constructed in two stages. First, we observe several traffic characteristics of peer-to-peer applications and traditional client-server based Internet services. We also observe the generic traffic properties in a client network. Then, based on the symmetry of network traffic in both temporal and spatial domains, we propose to use a bitmap filter to bound the network resources consumed by peer-to-peer applications. The proposed algorithm takes only constant storage and computation time. The evaluation also shows that with a small amount of memory, the peer-to-peer traffic can be properly bounded close to a predefined amount. © 2007 IEEE.

37349011779	A lightweight key agreement protocol with user anonymity in ubiquitous computing environments	In a smart living environment, a person can use various intelligent devices to obtain his desired services at any time and any place. For convenience, most of these devices are small and of limited power and computation capacity. Therefore, an admired protocol should take these into consideration. In particular, identification and key agreement are basic mechanisms when a user wants to get a secure service from a server over the public networks. However, if the user's identity is transmitted in a plaintext, an adversary can intercept the information and use it to launch some attacks. In this paper, we propose a key agreement protocol with user anonymity based on elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. In our protocol, the storage and computation costs are very low and the server does not maintain a password file for identifying the users. Therefore, our protocol is suitable for applying ubiquitous computing environments. © 2007 IEEE.

37349081882	Design and implementation of secure communication channels over UPnP networks	The scale of smart living spaces can be varied from small, e.g. a household, to large, e.g. a building or a campus, scales. As the scale of the space increases, we can expect that the requirements for the two features - zero-configuration and secure data communication channels - are getting more important. The feature of zero-configuration reduces the cost to setup the network and secure data communication channels guarantee both the privacy and confidentiality of possible sensitive data transmitted in the network. In this paper, we integrated two technologies, UPnP and secure group communication techniques, to construct an almost zero-configuration secure environment for smart living spaces. A secure and flexible communication environment is constructed as follows. An UPnP controller is implemented to manage devices in the same administrative domain and hence these devices can be treated as members in the same communication group. Then, by leveraging group key management algorithms, we successfully build both point-to-point and broadcast secure channels over the UPnP network. © 2007 IEEE.

By this service, many interesting applications, such as electronic elections, anonymous group discussions, with user identification confidential can be easily realized. No one can trace a sender's identification and no one but the authority centre can distinguish an anonymous message from a normal message when a user uses the anonymous channel. The user anonymity in our scheme is neither based on any trusted authority nor on the cooperation of all potential senders. Our scheme can be easily applied to existing wireless systems, such as GSM and CDPD, without changing their underlying structures.

0033686335	A false-sharing free distributed shared memory management scheme	Distributed shared memory (DSM) systems on top of network of workstations are especially vulnerable to the impact of false sharing because of their higher memory transaction overheads and thus higher false sharing penalties. In this paper we develop a dynamic-granularity shared memory management scheme that eliminates false sharing without sacrificing the transparency to conventional shared-memory applications. Our approach utilizes a special threaded splay tree (TST) for shared memory information management, and a dynamic token-based path-compression synchronization algorithm for data transferring. The combination of the TST and path compression is quite efficient; asymptotically, in an n-processor system with m shared memory segments, synchronizing at most s segments takes O(slogmlogn) amortized computation steps and generates O(slogn) communication messages, respectively. Based on the proposed scheme we constructed an experimental DSM prototype which consists of several Ethernet-connected Pentium-based computers running Linux. Preliminary benchmark results on our prototype indicate that our scheme is quite efficient, significantly outperforming traditional schemes and scaling up well.

0033701935	A naming, storage, and retrieval model for software assets	This paper presents a model for the naming, packing, version control, storage, and retrieval of software assets. The naming and version control schemes are based on contentderived coding of the asset body. The name-to-asset mapping can be fixed or be varying with time. The packing scheme is designed so that the asset integrity verification and authentication information is made an intrinsic part of the packed asset. A comparison with an existing naming and version control scheme is given. The storage and retrieval scheme is a unification of four most commonly used methods, namely the enumerative method, the keyword-based method, the faceted method, and the textbased method. This unification makes it possible for the users to access heterogeneous repositories (with different storage and retrieval methods) simultaneously, using the same tool set and query syntax. The degradation functions technique is used to automatically broaden queries. A demonstrative retrieval tool is described to show how the unification of methods is done at the user interface level.

0033723635	Prediction-capable data compression algorithms for improving transmission efficiency on distributed systems	Network bandwidth is a kind of limited and precious resources in modern distributed computing environments. Insufficient bandwidth will severely degrade the performance of a distributed computing task in exchanging massive data among the networked hosts. A feasible solution to save bandwidth is to incorporate data compression during transmission. However, blind, or unconditional, compression may only result in waste of CPU power and even slow down the overall network transfer rate, if the data to be transmitted are hard to compress. In this paper, we present a prediction-capable lossless data compression algorithm to address this problem. By adapting to the compression speed of a host CPU, current system load, and network speed, our algorithm can accurately estimate the compression time of each data block given, and decide whether it should be compressed or not. Experimental results indicate that our prediction mechanism is both efficient and effective, achieving 93% of prediction accuracy at the cost of only 3.2% of the execution time of unconditional compression.

38149099184	A simple and efficient key exchange scheme against the smart card loss problem	In a ubiquitous computing environment, a person can use various intelligent devices to obtain his desired services at any time and any place. For convenience, most of these devices are small and of limited power and computation capacity. Therefore, an admired scheme should take these into consideration. In 2006, Lin et al. proposed a lightweight authentication scheme only using one-way hash function. However, their scheme is vulnerable to the several security threats. It is the germination of our idea. In this paper, we only require one-way hash function, exclusive OR operation, a smart card, and a memorial password to construct a simple and efficient key exchange scheme to withstand the most known security threats. We also take several merits into our scheme. First, the friendliness and fairness of a user are considered. The user can freely select her/his identity and password for registration and employ the used identity to register repeatedly when the smart card has lost. Second, a user does not need to worry about the damage of the smart card loss problem even if the content of the smart card has been extracted. Our scheme can take care hard security threats and efficient at the same time. Since our scheme does not require any symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems, the communication and computation cost is very low. Therefore, our scheme is suitable to be applied in ubiquitous computing environments. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2007.

39049151374	On the sensitivity of online game playing time to network QoS	Online gaming is one of the most profitable businesses on the Internet. Among various threats to continuous player subscriptions, network lags are particularly notorious. It is widely known that frequent and long lags frustrate game players, but whether the players actually take action and leave a game is unclear. Motivated to answer this question, we apply survival analysis to a 1,356-million-packet trace from a sizeable MMORPG, called ShenZhou Online. We find that both network delay and network loss significantly affect a player's willingness to continue a game. For ShenZhou Online, the degrees of player "intolerance" of minimum RTT, RTT jitter, client loss rate, and server loss rate are in the proportion of 1:2:11:6. This indicates that 1) while many network games provide "ping time," i.e., the RTT, to players to facilitate server selection, it would be more useful to provide information about delay jitters; and 2) players are much less tolerant of network loss than delay. This is due to the game designer's decision to transfer data in TCP, where packet loss not only results in additional packet delays due to in-order delivery and retransmission, but also a lower sending rate. © 2006 IEEE.

39049160227	The impact of network variabilities on TCP clocking schemes	TCP employs a self-clocking scheme that times the sending of packets. In that, the data packets are sent in a burst when the returning acknowledgement packets are received. This self-clocking scheme (also known as ack-clocking) is deemed a key factor to the the burstiness of TCP traffic and the source of various performance problems-high packet loss, long delay, and high delay jitter. Previous work has suggested contradictively the effectiveness of TCP Pacing as a remedy to alleviate the traffic burstiness. In this paper, we analyze systematically and in more robust experiments the impact of network variabilities on the behavior of TCP clocking schemes. We find that 1) aggregated pacing traffic could be burstier than aggregated ack-clocking traffic. Physical explanation and experimental simulations are provided to support this argument. 2) The round-trip time heterogeneity and flow multiplexing significantly influence the behaviors of both ack-clocking and pacing schemes. Evaluating the performance of clocking schemes without considering these effects is prone to inconsistent results. 3) Pacing outperforms ack-clocking in more realistic settings from the traffic burstiness point of view. © 2005 IEEE.

40249100544	Building high-performance and reconfigurable bandwidth controllers with adaptive clustering	As quality of service gains more and more attention, bandwidth controllers gradually become one of the most important network systems used in modern Internet environment. The demand for high-performance in-line bandwidth controllers is driven by the growing bandwidth available in the last mile WAN links as well as the sophisticated packet processing functions that become essential in current computer networks. In this paper, we propose an adaptive clustering scheme to scale the throughput of in-line devices and implement the bandwidth control functions over a cluster of in-line devices. The proposed scheme aggregates the processing power of multiple in-line devices in the cluster by making incoming traffic self-dispatched in a transparent fashion, and incorporates a flow migration mechanism that keeps the load of each device balanced. The resulted cluster is also able to tolerate device failures and hence is run-time reconfigurable. Based on the proposed scheme, we successfully design a distributed policy adjustment algorithm, the proportional bandwidth allocation algorithm, and implement a clustered bandwidth controller over embedded Linux. The results of performance evaluation suggest that the proposed traffic redistribution mechanism and distributed policy adjustment algorithm can be used together to realize high-performance and reconfigurable bandwidth controllers. © IEEE.

34247877631	Secure multicast in dynamic environments	A secure multicast framework should only allow authorized members of a group to decrypt received messages; usually, one "group key" is shared by all approved members. However, this raises the problem of "one affects all", whereby the actions of one member affect the whole group. Many researchers have solved the problem by dividing a group into several subgroups, but most current solutions require key distribution centers to coordinate secure data communications between subgroups. We believe this is a constraint on network scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to solve key management problems in multicast networks. Our contribution is threefold: (1) We exploit the ElGamal cryptosystem and propose a technique of key composition. (2) Using key composition with proxy cryptography, the key distribution centers used in secure multicast frameworks are eliminated. (3) For key composition, the framework is designed to resist node failures and support topology reconstruction, which makes it suitable for dynamic network environments. Without reducing the security or performance of proxy cryptography, we successfully eliminate the need for key distribution centers. Our analysis shows that the proposed framework is secure, and comparison with other similar frameworks demonstrates that it is efficient in terms of time and space complexity. In addition, the costs of most protocol operations are bounded by constants, regardless of a group's size and the number of branches of transit nodes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Instead of using Merkel tree to combine multiple μTESLA instance, we apply compressed Bloom filters to multiple μTESLA. Our scheme can support longer duration and prolong the self-healing property. We greatly reduce the communication overhead at the cost of allocating a moderate space in each receiver. Combing with PKC computation like ECC, our scheme can guarantee the long-term security and also mitigate energy consumption. Moreover, our methods can be extend to the situation of multiple senders, offering efficient user addition and revocation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

46749128628	A high-performance clustering scheme with application in network intrusion prevention system	As network security gains more and more attention, network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS) gradually become one of the most important network systems used in modern Internet environment. The demand for high performance NIPS is driven by the growing bandwidth available in the last mile WAN links as well as the increasing complexity of packet inspection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive clustering scheme to scale the throughput of in-line devices. The proposed scheme aggregates the processing power of multiple in-line devices in a cluster by making incoming traffic self-dispatched in a transparent fashion, and incorporates a traffic redistribution mechanism that keeps the load of each device balanced. The cluster is also able to tolerate device failures so that devices in the cluster can be inserted or removed while the system is running. Based on the designed architecture, we deploy Snort, which is a well-known and popular NIPS, on each device of the cluster and implement all the proposed mechanisms as kernel modules over embedded Linux. According to the results of performance evaluation, we successfully build a high performance, load balancing, and fault tolerant NIPS by means of the proposed mechanisms over the designed in-line device cluster. © 2007 IEEE.

50249184043	An anonymous and deniable conversation for a thin client	In most client/server architecture, the identity of a client is transmitted in a plaintext through an insecure network environment. It is a convenient way for a server to authenticate the identity of a client. However, it is also a chance for an adversary to launch some attacks on this identity. In personal and business communications, a client and a server have many opportunities to perform a closed conversation such as anonymous transactions. Also in some applications, the transmitted contents should not be proved to a third party from the client or the server. In this paper, we propose an anonymous and deniable key exchange protocol for a thin client based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. © 2008 IEEE.

51349136633	A web metering scheme for fair advertisement transactions	Since the rapid development of the Internet, many advertisers would want to introduce their goods on web sites. For achieving fair network advertisement payment, a payment system may need to evaluate the number of visited clients for particular web pages. However, advertisers fear that web servers inflate the number of metering. Also, well servers fear to receive a forged witness from a client. If one of the above situations happened, the payment of network advertisement is unfair. In this paper, we propose a user-efficient and fair web metering scheme for ubiquitous environments, where clients can use various intelligent devices to obtain their desired services at any time and any place. © 2008 IEEE.

57349087202	Detecting VoIP traffic based on human conversation patterns	Owing to the enormous growth of VoIP applications, an effective means of identifying VoIP is now essential for managing a number of network traffic issues, such as reserving bandwidth for VoIP traffic, assigning high priority for VoIP flows, or blocking VoIP calls to certain destinations. Because the protocols, port numbers, and codecs used by VoIP services are shifting toward proprietary, encrypted, and dynamic methods, traditional VoIP identification approaches, including port- and payload-based schemes, are now less effective. Developing a traffic identification scheme that can work for general VoIP flows is therefore of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a VoIP flow identification scheme based on the unique interaction pattern of human conversations. Our scheme is particularly useful for two reasons: 1) flow detection relies on human conversations rather than packet timing; thus, it is resistant to network variability; and 2) detection is based on a short sequence of voice activities rather than the whole packet stream. Hence, the scheme can operate as a traffic management module to provide QoS guarantees or block VoIP calls in real time. The performance evaluation, which is based on extensive real-life traffic traces, shows that the proposed method achieves an identification accuracy of 95% in the first 4 seconds of the detection period and 97% in 11 seconds. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

59949083615	Identifying MMORPG Bots: A traffic analysis approach	Massively multiplayer online role playing games (MMORPGs) have become extremely popular among network gamers. Despite their success, one of MMORPG's greatest challenges is the increasing use of game bots, that is, autoplaying game clients. The use of game bots is considered unsportsmanlike and is therefore forbidden. To keep games in order, game police, played by actual human players, often patrol game zones and question suspicious players. This practice, however, is labor-intensive and ineffective. To address this problem, we analyze the traffic generated by human players versus game bots and propose general solutions to identify game bots. Taking Ragnarok Online as our subject, we study the traffic generated by human players and game bots. We find that their traffic is distinguishable by 1) the regularity in the release time of client commands, 2) the trend and magnitude of traffic burstiness in multiple time scales, and 3) the sensitivity to different network conditions. Based on these findings, we propose four strategies and two ensemble schemes to identify bots. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the proposed methods against countermeasures of bot developers, and consider a number of possible ways to manage the increasingly serious bot problem.

59949097447	A generalizable methodology for quantifying user satisfaction	Quantifying user satisfaction is essential, because the results can help service providers deliver better services. In this work, we propose a generalizable methodology, based on survival analysis, to quantify user satisfaction in terms of session times, i.e., the length of time users stay with an application. Unlike subjective human surveys, our methodology is based solely on passive measurement, which is more cost-efficient and better able to capture subconscious reactions. Furthermore, by using session times, rather than a specific performance indicator, such as the level of distortion of voice signals, the effects of other factors like loudness and sidetone, can also be captured by the developed models. Like survival analysis, our methodology is characterized by low complexity and a simple model-developing process. The feasibility of our methodology is demonstrated through case studies of ShenZhou Online, a commercial MMORPG in Taiwan, and the most prevalent VoIP application in the world, namely Skype. Through the model development process, we can also identify the most significant performance factors and their impacts on user satisfaction and discuss how they can be exploited to improve user experience and optimize resource allocation.

63749109822	A collusion-resistant automation scheme for social moderation systems	For current Web 2.0 services, manual examination of user uploaded content is normally required to ensure its legitimacy and appropriateness, which is a substantial burden to service providers. To reduce labor costs and the delays caused by content censoring, social moderation has been proposed as a front-line mechanism, whereby user moderators are encouraged to examine content before system moderation is required. Given the immerse amount of new content added to the Web each day, there is a need for automation schemes to facilitate rear system moderation. This kind of mechanism is expected to automatically summarize reports from user moderators and ban misbehaving users or remove inappropriate content whenever possible. However, the accuracy of such schemes may be reduced by collusion attacks, where some work together to mislead the automatic summarization in order to obtain shared benefits. In this paper, we propose a collusion-resistant automation scheme for social moderation systems. Because some user moderators may collude and dishonestly claim that a user misbehaves, our scheme detects whether an accusation from a user moderator is fair or malicious based on the structure of mutual accusations of all users in the system. Through simulations we show that collusion attacks are likely to succeed if an intuitive count-based automation scheme is used. The proposed scheme, which is based on the community structure of the user accusation graph, achieves a decent performance in most scenarios. ©2009 IEEE.

64149102436	A robust authentication scheme with user anonymity for wireless environments	Due to the openness of data transmission over wireless environments, the wireless networks are susceptible to various security menaces. Authentication and key agreement become a basic and most important procedure before a mobile user can obtain the desired services. Apart from the security threats, in a limited bandwidth and the openness wireless environment, low computation and communication cost with privacy should be taken into considerations. Recently, Zhu and Ma proposed an authentication scheme with user anonymity for wireless environments based on hash functions and smart cards. In their scheme, the communication and computation cost is very low. However, Lee et al. pointed out that Zhu and Ma's scheme is vulnerable to several security problems. The perfect backward secrecy and mutual authentication are not provided and the forgery attack can work in Zhu and Ma's scheme. At the same time, Lee et al. proposed an improvement to solve the above weaknesses and to keep the efficiency. However, in this paper, we show that Lee et al. 's scheme cannot provide the anonymity for a mobile user and the key agreement procedure is not correct. Also, if a smart card is stolen by an adversary, the adversary could launch the impersonation attack on Lee et al. 's scheme. We then propose a new authentication scheme. Our scheme not only provides more security criteria but also requires low communication and computation cost. Finally, we use the logic analysis method to prove our scheme.

67349274942	Effect of network quality on player departure behavior in online games	Understanding the impact of network conditions on player satisfaction, which is one of the major concerns of network game designers, is a popular research topic. Of the various ways to gauge user satisfaction, in this paper, we focus on how network quality affects a player's decision to leave a game prematurely. To answer this question, we analyze a 1,356-million-packet trace from a large commercial Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) called ShenZhou Online. We show that both network delay and network loss significantly affect a player's decision to leave a game prematurely. It is feasible to predict whether players will quit prematurely based on the network conditions they experience. The proposed model can determine the relative impact of different types of network impairment. For our traces, the degrees of player intolerance to network delay, delay jitter, client packet loss, and server packet loss are in the proportion of 1:2:4:3 approximately. The model can also be used to make system design decisions. Through simulations, we show that by prioritizing server processing according to the goodness of network conditions, employing dejitter buffers, or replacing TCP with a more lightweight transport protocol, the probability of premature departure can be significantly reduced. In this way, we demonstrate how our model of players' network experience provides feedback for the design of online games. © 2009 IEEE.

67249126289	Inferring speech activity from encrypted skype traffic	Normally, voice activity detection (VAD) refers to speech processing algorithms for detecting the presence or absence of human speech in segments of audio signals. In this paper, however, we focus on speech detection algorithms that take VoIP traffic instead of audio signals as input. We call this category of algorithms network-level VAD. Traditional VAD usually plays a fundamental role in speech processing systems because of its ability to delimit speech segments. Network-level VAD, on the other hand, can be quite helpful in network management, which is the motivation for our study. We propose the first real-time network-level VAD algorithm that can extract voice activity from encrypted and non-silence-suppressed Skype traffic. We evaluate the speech detection accuracy of the proposed algorithm with extensive real- life traces. The results show that our scheme achieve reasonably good performance even high degree of randomness has been injected into the network traffic. © 2008 IEEE.

67649386877	Fair anonymous rewarding based on electronic cash	This manuscript presents an anonymous rewarding protocol based on electronic cash. In the protocol, a reward provider publishes a problem to solicit a satisfactory solution of the problem. The provider offers a reward to the first person that can supply her/him a satisfactory solution of the problem. A reward claimant possesses a possible solution of the problem and sends her/his solution to the provider to claim the reward. Among all the claimants, the first qualified claimant is selected to obtain the reward. Not only is the privacy of the honest claimants, including the selected claimant, protected against the provider, but also the provider cannot decline the selected claimant her/his entitled reward without being detected after acquiring the solution from the claimant. Especially, if the provider can convince the message forwarding servers in the protocol that some malicious claimant has offered a forged solution to interfere with the rewarding process, these servers will help the provider to trace the dishonest claimant. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

67650656376	A sector-based routing model over structured Peer-to-Peer networks	In a structured peer-to-peer network, frequent join and leave of peer members cause huge maintenance overhead. To deal with this churn problem, we proposed a sector-based rout- ing model (SBRM). The key space is divided into several sectors and each sector has a peer member acting as the re- lay proxy of the sector. Then the cost of join and leave can be greatly reduced. In this paper we choose Chord as the underlying structured network and perform a series of sim- ulation. Analysis and simulation results show that SBRM achieve lower communication cost when a member joined or left the system, and message routing path length is also shortened. Copyright 2008 ACM.

67650683203	A location-id sensitive key establishment scheme in static wireless sensor networks	Sensor networks are usually consist of thousands of resource-limited nodes and are deployed in a designated area without any fixed infrastructure. While the establishment of the pairwise keys between any pair of adjacent nodes to build a secure link remains the main concern in the design of key management protocols, malicious attacks aim at routing information, exhaust node's resource, and compromised secrets can misdirect the data flow or denial the network service with relatively small effort. Many mission-critic sensor network applications demand an effective, light, and flexible algorithm yet robust under attacks. Based on the LEAP+ scheme, we propose an improved LEAP+ by adding location information into the key establishment phase. By identifying the correctness of the id-location pair, our scheme effectively limits the Sybil attack and mitigates the damage of HELLO flood attack and node cloning attack. We furthermore propose an authentication phase in our scheme to defend possible replay attacks. The analysis shows that our scheme is more robust than LEAP+ with only minor increase of computation overhead. Copyright 2008 ACM.

67649933265	Privacy and anonymity protection with blind threshold signatures	A set of group-oriented blind (t, n) threshold signature schemes is proposed based on the discrete logarithm problem. Using these schemes, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the group in signing blind threshold signatures. A threshold signature in the proposed schemes is the same size as an individual signature, and the signature verification process is simplified by means of a group public key. The schemes are suitable for single-authority applications in privacy protection, secure voting systems, and anonymous payment systems for distributing the power of a single authority. The assistance of a mutually trusted authority is not required. In addition, individual signers can choose their own private keys, and all the members together decide on the group public key.

69949121274	On the challenge and design of transport protocols for MMORPGs	Although MMORPGs are becoming increasingly popular as well as a highly profitable Internet business, there is still a fundamental design question: Which transport protocol should be used-TCP, UDP, or some other protocol? In this paper, we first evaluate whether TCP is suitable for MMORPGs, and then propose some novel transport strategies for this genre of games. Our analysis of a trace collected from a TCP-based MMORPG called ShenZhou Online indicates that TCP is unwieldy and inappropriate for MMORPGs. We find that the degraded network performance problems are due to the following characteristics of MMORPG traffic: 1) tiny packets, 2) a low packet rate, 3) application-limited traffic generation, and 4) bi-directional traffic. Since not all game packets require reliable transmission or in-order delivery, transmitting all packets with a strict delivery guarantee causes high delays and delay jitters. Therefore, our proposed transport strategies assign game packets with appropriate levels of transmission guarantee depending on the requirements of the packets' contents. To compare the performance of our approach with that of existing transport protocols, we conduct network simulations with a real-life game trace from Angel's Love. The results demonstrate that our strategies significantly reduce the end-to-end delay and delay jitter of packet delivery. Finally, we show that our strategies effectively raise satisfaction levels of the game players. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

70449510134	Peer-to-peer application recognition based on signaling activity	Because of the enormous growth in the number of peer-to-peer (P2P) applications in recent years, P2P traffic now constitutes a substantial proportion of Internet traffic. The ability to accurately identify different P2P applications from the network traffic is essential for managing a number of network traffic issues, such as service differentiation and capacity planning. However, modern P2P applications often use proprietary protocols, dynamic port numbers, and packet encryptions, which make traditional identification approaches like port-based or signature-based identification less effective. In this paper, we propose an approach for accurately recognizing P2P applications running on monitored hosts based on signaling behavior, which is regulated by the underlying P2P protocol; therefore, each application possesses a distinguishing characteristic. We consider that the signaling behavior of each P2P application can serve as a unique signature for application identification. Our approach is particularly useful for three reasons: 1) it does not need to access the packet payload; 2) it recognizes applications based purely on their signaling behavior; and 3) it can identify particular P2P applications. The performance evaluation shows that 92% of a real-life traffic trace can be correctly recognized within a 5-minute monitoring period. ©2009 IEEE.

70450227334	An empirical evaluation of voip playout buffer dimensioning in Skype, Google Talk, and MSN messenger	VoIP playout buffer dimensioning has long been a challenging optimization problem, as the buffer size must maintain a balance between conversational interactivity and speech quality. The conversational quality may be affected by a number of factors, some of which may change over time. Although a great deal of research effort has been expended in trying to solve the problem, how the research results are applied in practice is unclear. In this paper, we investigate the playout buffer dimensioning algorithms applied in three popular VoIP applications, namely, Skype, Google Talk, and MSN Messenger. We conduct experiments to assess how the applications adjust their playout buffer sizes. Using an objective QoE (Quality of Experience) metric, we show that Google Talk and MSN Messenger do not adjust their respective buffer sizes appropriately, while Skype does not adjust its buffer at all. In other words, they could provide better QoE to users by improving their buffer dimensioning algorithms. Moreover, none of the applications adapts its buffer size to the network loss rate, which should also be considered to ensure optimal QoE provisioning. Copyright 2009 ACM.

72349085883	A geographic scheme with location update for ad hoc routing	Because of the dynamic network topology, routing becomes a challenging problem in MANET. Many geographic schemes are proposed to improve routing performance but cause the challenges in geographic routing when deal with the topological problems such as a hole in the network and the location maintenances. In this paper we propose a geographic scheme with location update (GLU) for ad hoc routing. An ad hoc on demand routing protocol for MANET is also provided by applying GLU (AOR-GLU). AOR-GLU inherits topology based routing that only maintains an active route but repairs the route by using geographic scheme to prevent the cost of flooding. The proposed protocol adopts a destination oriented mechanism to maintain occupied locations and eliminates the additional overhead of a location service. The simulation results show that the proposed routing protocol is more efficient by achieving higher packet delivery ratio and producing less overhead in comparing with AODV, DSR and OGPR. © 2009 IEEE.

72449148707	A crowdsourceable QoE evaluation framework for multimedia content	Until recently, QoE (Quality of Experience) experiments had to be conducted in academic laboratories; however, with the advent of ubiquitous Internet access, it is now possible to ask an Internet crowd to conduct experiments on their personal computers. Since such a crowd can be quite large, crowdsourcing enables researchers to conduct experiments with a more diverse set of participants at a lower economic cost than would be possible under laboratory conditions. However, because participants carry out experiments without supervision, they may give erroneous feedback perfunctorily, carelessly, or dishonestly, even if they receive a reward for each experiment. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourceable framework to quantify the QoE of multimedia content. The advantages of our framework over traditional MOS ratings are: 1) it enables crowdsourcing because it supports systematic verification of participants' inputs; 2) the rating procedure is simpler than that of MOS, so there is less burden on participants; and 3) it derives interval-scale scores that enable subsequent quantitative analysis and QoE provisioning. We conducted four case studies, which demonstrated that, with our framework, researchers can outsource their QoE evaluation experiments to an Internet crowd without risking the quality of the results; and at the same time, obtain a higher level of participant diversity at a lower monetary cost.

77649293004	Robust and efficient three-party user authentication and key agreement using bilinear pairings	For providing a secure distributed computer environment, flexible and robust user authentication and key agreement is very important. In addition to user authentication and key agreement, identity privacy is very useful for attracting users to share private contents. In three-party environments, both communicating parties can share separately passwords with a trusted third party rather than themselves. This approach can reduce the key management complexity when any two potential users may want to build a secure communication between them. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient three-party password authenticated key agreement scheme using bilinear pairings. The main merits include: (1) there does not need any password or verification table in the server; (2) a user can choose or change his own password freely; (3) any two users can authenticate each other; (4) it can protect users' privacy; (5) any two users can generate an agreed session key; (6) it does not have a serious synchronization-clock problem; (7) even if the secret information stored in a user's smart card is compromised, it can prevent the offline dictionary attack. © 2010 ICIC International.

However, since this scheme is based on polynomial-based approach, it cannot provide authentication service. In this paper, we first present a novel tame-based approach, in which a tame automorphism in algebra is exploited to generate a symmetric and two-one bivariate map, for key predistribution. This tame-based approach can achieve the goal of authentication. We then propose a variance of the grid-based scheme, based on this tame-based approach and utilizing deployment information. As a result, the proposed scheme can offer basic authentication service in sensor networks and have better performance, in addition to preserving the advantages of the grid-based scheme. © 2009 IEEE.

However, this method cannot offer the basic authentication function of security. In this paper, we develop a novel tame-based approach to achieve the goal of authentication. We then present a general framework , for pairwise key establishment, in the basis of this tame-based approach. It turns out that this tame map can substitute the polynomial in any existing polynomial pool-based scheme to offer the authentication service. In particular, we further introduce a new scheme, local symmetric-tame maps predistribution scheme, based on this framework. The analysis demonstrates that, in addition to being able to provide authentication service, this scheme not only has significantly better performance, but also can achieve greater resilience on security than existing schemes.

77953100466	Network game design: Hints and implications of player interaction	While psychologists analyze network game-playing behavior in terms of players' social interaction and experience, understanding user behavior is equally important to network researchers, because how users act determines how well network systems, such as online games, perform. To gain a better understanding of patterns of player interaction and their implications for game design, we analyze a 1, 356-million-packet trace of ShenZhou Online, a mid-sized commercial MMORPG. This work is dedicated to draw out hints and implications of player interaction patterns, which is inferred from network-level traces, for online games. We find that the dispersion of players in a virtual world is heavy-tailed, which implies that static and fixed-size partitioning of game worlds is inadequate. Neighbors and teammates tend to be closer to each other in network topology. This property is an advantage, because message delivery between the hosts of interacting players can be faster than between those of unrelated players. In addition, the property can make game playing fairer, since interacting players tend to have similar latencies to their servers. We also find that participants who have a higher degree of social interaction tend to play much longer, and players who are closer in network topology tend to team up for longer periods. This suggests that game designers could increase the "stickiness" of games by encouraging, or even forcing, team playing. Copyright 2006 ACM.

Without efficient defense mechanism, an adversary can inject false data into the system, incurring redundant message forwarding, consuming node power, and degrading network performance. Unlike conventional approaches directly using message authentication codes (MAC), we utilize Bloom filter techniques to build an authentication manifest, which is called en-route authentication bitmap (EAB). EAB helps nodes on the routing path to filter out false data in high success rate, thus confine the injection attacks within the one or two hops from the adversary. EAB can spend a few bytes of bandwidth, whereas effectively protect the forwarding path of tens of hops. Our scheme is suitable for resource-constrained networks like WSN, PAN, MANET, etc. ©2010 IEEE.

77956260685	A privacy and delegation-enhanced user authentication protocol for Portable Communication Systems	Recently, Lee et al. proposed a security enhanced delegation-based authentication protocol for Portable Communication Systems (PCSs). The major merits include: 1 the privacy protection of Mobile User (MS) 2 MS can construct a digital signature to prove the requests 3 the satisfaction of some security properties 4 the mutual authentication between MS and the Visited Location Register (VLR) 5 low computation and communication cost of MS. We then show that the privacy of MS is not kept and the overcharge problem exists in Lee et al.'s protocol and propose a method to enhance the delegation and security level and to keep the same efficiency.

78650405278	Smart card-based secure web services in the three-party setting	Going along with the rapid development of web technologies, people can ma/ce a great quantity of transactions through web services. For some purpose-restricted applicutions, service requesters and service providers locate at different network domains and they want to protect their delivery contents against being eavesdropped, altered, or fabricated from outsiderw. They require a communal trusted third party to help them achieve the purpose. Using a traditional two-party key agreement protocol to negotiate a common session key in three-party case, the communication and computation cost are high. In this paper we propose a three-party key agreement protocol to construct a secure communication for web services using smart cards. In our protocol, the major merits include: (1) prevention of the replay attack; (2) satisfaction of the perfect forward secrecy; (3,) satisfaction of the master key forward secrecy; (4) prevention of the password guessing attack; (5) satisfaction of the explicit key confirmation; (6) prevention of the impersonation attack; (7) security against the session state re?eal; and (8) pre?'ention of the smart card loss problem. © 2010 ISSN.

78650131585	Radar chart: Scanning for high QoE in QoS dimensions	The ongoing convergence of QoE (Quality of Experience) and QoS (Quality of Service) studies to give a thorough understanding of the end-user has posed numerous exciting possibilities for network and multimedia researchers. However, there is not yet a proper visualization tool that is able to map the many-to-one relationship between QoS metrics and QoE, leaving researchers speechless in the cacophony of traditional two-dimensional diagrams. Though mostly employed in qualitative analysis, we found that the radar chart, with a few tweaks, surprisingly suitable for the purpose.

78650161690	Firework search for location aided routing enhancement in mobile ad-hoc networks	This paper proposes a firework search for location aided routing enhancement (FLARE) in mobile ad-hoc networks. The proposed protocol, FLARE, is a location aided, beaconless, and pure reactive topology based routing protocol. FLARE uses a firework search framework to cope with node mobility and can adapt to highly dynamic network topologies. The firework search framework is based on a distributed differential relay which is a beaconless and reactive mechanism. In the firework search framework, nodes follow the distributed differential relay to forward a request to an estimated destination location when it needs to repair a broken route. If the destination has moved away the estimated location, a node near the estimated location initiates a firework search to find the destination. To maintain the occupied locations, we also introduce a fundamental reactive location service with the destination oriented location update and the location estimation. Comparing to the existing location services, such fundamental location service is more efficient because it produces much less overhead. The simulation results show that FLARE is more efficient with higher packet delivery ratio and less overhead in comparison with AODV, DSR and GPSR+HLS. © 2010 ACM.

78650163052	Online game QoE evaluation using paired comparisons	To satisfy players' gaming experience, there is a strong need for a technique that can measure a game's quality systematically, efficiently, and reliably. In this paper, we propose to use paired comparisons and probabilistic choice models to quantify online games' QoE under various network situations. The advantages of our methodology over the traditional MOS ratings are 1) the rating procedure is simpler thus less burden is on experiment participants, 2) it derives ratio-scale scores, and 3) it enables systematic verification of participants' inputs. As a demonstration, we apply our methodology to evaluate three popular FPS (first-person-shooter) games, namely, Alien Arena (Alien), Halo, and Unreal Tournament (UT), and investigate their network robustness. The results indicate that Halo performs the best in terms of their network robustness against packet delay and loss. However, if we take the degree of the games' sophistication into account, we consider that the robustness of UT against downlink delays should able be improved. We also show that our methodology can be a helpful tool for making decisions about design alternatives, such as how dead reckoning algorithms and time synchronization mechanisms should be implemented. ©2010 IEEE.

78751645363	Robust authentication and key agreement scheme preserving the privacy of secret key	In ubiquitous computing environments, people may obtain their services from application servers by using mobile devices at any time and anywhere. For convenience, most of those devices are small and of limited power and computation capacity. In this paper, we propose a robust user authentication and key agreement scheme suitable for ubiquitous computing environments. The main merits include: (1) a security-sensitive verification table is not required in the server; (2) the password can be chosen and changed freely by the clients and cannot be derived by the privileged administrator of the server; (3) all well-known security threats are solved in our proposed scheme; (4) the scheme does not have a serious time-synchronization problem; (5) the client and the server can establish a common session key; (6) the scheme is practical and efficient; (7) the scheme can preserve the privacy of the client's secret key even if the secret information stored in a smart card is compromised. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

79952538982	Provably secure and efficient identification and key agreement protocol with user anonymity	Many authentication and key agreement protocols were proposed for protecting communicated messages. In previous protocols, if the user s identity is transmitted in plaintext, an adversary can tap the communications and employ it to launch some attacks. In most protocols with user anonymity, they focus on satisfaction of several security requirements. From a client s point of view, those protocols are not admired since the cost of storage, computation and communication is high. In pervasive computing, a client usually uses a limited-resource device to access multiple servers. The storage and computation are very important issues especially in this kind of environments. Also, for a convenience of designing protocol, most protocols use timestamps to prevent the replay attack. As we know, the serious time synchronization problem exists in timestamp-based protocols. Finally, most protocols do not have formal proofs for the security. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient identification and key agreement protocol with user anonymity based on the difficulty of cracking the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman assumption. In addition, we also propose an augmented protocol for providing the explicit mutual authentication. Compared with the related protocols, the proposed protocols computation cost is lower and the key length is shorter. Therefore, our protocols are suitable even for applications in low power computing environments. Finally, we formally prove the security of the proposed protocols by employing the random oracle model. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

79952839648	World of warcraft avatar history dataset	From the perspective of game system designers, players' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users' behavior. It can even help us predict players' loyalty to specific games. In this paper, we present the World of Warcraft Avatar History (WoWAH) dataset, which comprises the records of 91,065 avatars. The data includes the avatars' game play times and a number of attributes, such as their race, profession, current level, and in-game locations, during a 1,107-day period between Jan. 2006 and Jan. 2009. We believe the WOWAH dataset could be used for various creative purposes, now that it is a public asset of the research community.

79952856599	Quantifying QoS requirements of network services	Despite all the efforts devoted to improving the QoS of networked multimedia services, the baseline for such improvements has yet to be defined. In other words, although it is well recognized that better network conditions generally yield better service quality, the exact minimum level of network QoS required to ensure satisfactory user experience remains an open question. In this paper, we propose a general, cheat-proof framework that enables researchers to systematically quantify the minimum QoS needs for real-time networked multimedia services. Our framework has two major features: 1) it measures the quality of a service that users find intolerable by intuitive responses and therefore reduces the burden on experiment participants; and 2) it is cheat-proof because it supports systematic verification of the participants' inputs. Via a pilot study involving 38 participants, we verify the efficacy of our framework by proving that even inexperienced participants can easily produce consistent judgments. In addition, by cross-application and cross-service comparative analysis, we demonstrate the usefulness of the derived QoS thresholds. Such knowledge will serve important reference in the evaluation of competitive applications, application recommendation, network planning, and resource arbitration. Copyright 2010 ACM.

79955421409	DevilTyper: A game for CAPTCHA usability evaluation	CAPTCHA is an effective and widely used solution for preventing computer programs (i.e., bots) from performing automated but often malicious actions, such as registering thousands of free email accounts or posting advertisement on Web blogs. To make CAPTCHAs robust to automatic character recognition techniques, the text in the tests are often distorted, blurred, and obscure. At the same time, those robust tests may prevent genuine users from telling the text easily and thus distribute the cost of crime prevention among all the users. Thus, we are facing a dilemma, that is, a CAPTCHA should be robust enough so that it cannot be broken by programs, but also needs to be easy enough so that users need not to repeatedly take tests because of wrong guesses. In this article, we attempt to resolve the dilemma by proposing a human computation game for quantifying the usability of CAPTCHAs. In our game, DevilTyper, players try to defeat as many devils as possible by solving CAPTCHAs, and player behavior in completing a CAPTCHA is recorded at the same time. Therefore, we can evaluate CAPTCHAs' usability by analyzing collected player inputs. Since DevilTyper provides entertainment itself, we conduct a large-scale study for CAPTCHAs' usability without the resource overhead required by traditional survey-based studies. In addition, we propose a consistent and reliable metric for assessing usability. Our evaluation results show that DevilTyper provides a fun and efficient platform for CAPTCHA designers to assess their CAPTCHA usability and thus improve CAPTCHA design. © 2011 ACM.

0035500012	Fair blind threshold signatures based on discrete logarithm	In this paper, we propose a group-oriented lair blind (t, n) threshold signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem. By the scheme, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the group to sign fair blind threshold signatures, which can be used in anonymous e-cash systems. Since blind signature schemes provide perfect unlinkability, such e-cash systems can be misused by criminals, e.g. to safely obtain a ransom or to launder money. Our scheme allows the judge (or the government) to deliver information allowing anyone of the t signers to link his view of the protocol and the message-signature pair. In our scheme, the size of a fair blind threshold signature is the same as that of an individual fair blind signature and the signature verification process is simplified by means of a group public key. The security of our scheme relies on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithm.

0035785373	An user efficient fair E-cash scheme with anonymous certificates	E-cash is considered as one of the coming mainstreams of digital currency due to its excellent security properties. With its perfect anonymity, however, e-cash may be misused to commit crimes. In this paper, we propose a fair e-cash scheme, which improves the previous schemes by reducing the computational and storage overhead of the trusted third party. In addition, our proposed scheme also possesses the desired user efficient property where a customer only has to compute several modular multiplication and addition in coin withdrawing. Due to the rapidly growing of the Internet access via mobile units with low computation power, the user efficient property is of great worth. Thus this work can provide an efficient and practical payment mechanism for electronic commerce.

0035786876	Towards ubiquitous computing via secure desktop service	Among all the approaches enabling remote access to the private information stored at some static locations, one approach, often referred as remote desktop control, provides the most intuitive form of such operations. With remote desktop control, people are able to access their personal desktops remotely and operate on them in the same way as they do when sitting in front of the consoles. A side effect of this approach is that the potential damages caused by misuses get severer, and the security issues hence become more important. In this paper, a scheme of authentication via mobile phones is proposed to make the approach of remote desktop control securer. Another benefit of this scheme comes from the globally deployed telecommunication network, which makes the application truly ubiquitous.

0036194645	A user efficient fair blind signature scheme for untraceable electronic cash	Blind signatures have been widely adopted to construct untraceable electronic cash systems since they are both unlinkable and unforgeable. Although unlinkability protects the privacy of customers and users, it may be abused by criminals for such purposes as to launder money or to safely get a ransom. The techniques of fair blind signatures are developed to deal with the abuse of unlinkability. In this paper we propose a user efficient fair blind signature scheme which makes it possible for a government or a judge to recover the link between a signature and the instance of the signing protocol which produces that signature when the unlinkability property is abused. Only two integers are required to form a signature in the proposed fair blind signature scheme. Furthermore, it only takes several modular multiplications for a user to obtain and verify a signature. It turns out that the scheme is suitable for situations where computation capability of users or customers is limited, such as smart cards and mobile units. Compared with existing blind signature schemes proposed in the literatures, our method reduces the computation required of users by more than 99%.

Based on the scheme, any t out of n signers in a group can represent the group in signing blind threshold signatures, which can be used in anonymous digital e-cash systems or secure voting systems. By means of our proposed scheme, the issue of e-coins is controlled by several authorities. In our scheme, the size of a blind threshold signature is the same as that of an individual blind signature, and the signature verification process is equivalent to that for an individual signature.

0036555079	An unlinkably divisible and intention attachable ticket scheme for runoff elections	In a runoff election, the second round of voting must be performed to elect an absolute-majority winner when no candidate receives more than 50% of the votes in the first round of voting. Many states, such as France, Portugal, and Russia, have adopted this type of voting systems to elect their Presidents. In this paper, an unlinkably divisible and intention attachable ticket scheme is designed for runoff elections. A ticket in our scheme is composed of a main vote and a spare vote. The main vote containing some voter's intention can be extracted from the ticket for the first round of voting. If the second round of voting is required, the tally center enables the spare votes such that each voter can derive a spare vote from his ticket. A voter can then attach his intention to his spare vote for the second round of voting and, especially, the spare vote cannot be linked to the main vote by the tally center. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036453755	A verifiable multi-authority secret election allowing abstention from voting	In this paper, we propose a robust and verifiable multi-authority secret voting scheme which meets the requirements of large-scale general elections. This scheme uses a uniquely blind threshold signature scheme to get blind threshold electronic votes such that any voter can abstain from voting after the registration phase. It also uses the threshold cryptosystem to guarantee fairness among the candidates' campaigns and to provide a mechanism for ensuring that any voter can make an open objection to the tally if his vote has not been published. In this scheme, the computations among voters are independent and voters only have to send an anonymous message to the counter after the registration phase. This scheme preserves the privacy of a voter from the counter, administrators, scrutineers and other voters. Completeness, robustness and verifiability of the voting process are ensured and hence no one can produce a false tally or corrupt or disrupt the election.

80052716019	Understanding the performance of thin-client gaming	The thin-client model is considered a good fit for online gaming. As modern games normally require tremendous computing and rendering power at the game client, deploying games with such models can transfer the burden of hardware upgrades from players to game operators. As a result, there are a variety of solutions proposed for thin-client gaming today. However, little is known about the performance of such thin-client systems in different scenarios, and there is no systematic means yet to conduct such analysis. In this paper, we propose a methodology for quantifying the performance of thin-clients on gaming, even for thin-clients which are close-sourced. Taking a classic game, Ms. Pac-Man, and three popular thin-clients, LogMeIn, TeamViewer, and UltraVNC, as examples, we perform a demonstration study and determine that 1) display frame rate and frame distortion are both critical to gaming; and 2) different thin-client implementations may have very different levels of robustness against network impairments. Generally, LogMeIn performs best when network conditions are reasonably good, while TeamViewer and UltraVNC are the better choices under certain network conditions. © 2011 IEEE.

84455169127	Measuring the latency of cloud gaming systems	Cloud gaming, i.e., real-time game playing via thin clients, relieves players from the need to constantly upgrade their computers and deal with compatibility issues when playing games. As a result, cloud gaming is generating a great deal of interest among entrepreneurs and the public. However, given the large design space, it is not yet known which platforms deliver the best quality of service and which design elements constitute a good cloud gaming system. This study is motivated by the question: How good is the real-timeliness of current cloud gaming systems? To address the question, we analyze the response latency of two cloud gaming platforms, namely, On Live and Stream My Game. Our results show that the streaming latency of OnLive is reasonable for real-time cloud gaming, while that of Stream My Game is almost twice the former when the Stream My Game server is provisioned using an Intel Core i7-920 PC. We believe that our measurement approach can be generally applied to PC-based cloud gaming platforms, and that it will further the understanding of such systems and lead to improvements.

84856952515	Tame pool-based pairwise key predistribution for large-scale sensor networks	Due to resource constraints on sensor nodes, public key cryptography is not desirable to use in sensor networks. Instead, symmetric cryptosystem using preloaded keys is suitable for this environment. In such a solution, pairwise key establishment is a fundamental task for securing sensor networks. However, the conventional polynomial-based key predistribution approach, on which many existing key management schemes in sensor networks were based, can only offer probabilistic authentication. In this paper, we first develop a novel tame-based key predistribution approach, where we exploit tame automorphisms to get symmetric and two-one bivariate maps for the pairwise key establishment. This tame-based approach can provide deterministic authentication between two parties. We then present a general framework for the key predistribution, on the basis of the tame-based approach. It turns out that this tame map can substitute the conventional polynomial in any existing polynomial-based scheme to offer deterministic authentication service. In particular, we further introduce a new key predistribution scheme, the local symmetric-tame maps predistribution scheme, based on this framework and the deployment information. The analysis demonstrates that, in addition to being able to provide deterministic authentication service, the scheme not only has significantly better performance, but can also achieve greater resilience on security than existing schemes. © 2012 ICIC International.

84862333021	Sempre: Secure multicast architecture using proxy Re-Encryption	The goal of a secure multicast communication environment is to ensure that only valid members belonging to the multicast group can decrypt data. A simple solution adopted by many previous studies is to use a "group key" that is shared by all group members. The sender uses the group key to encrypt the multicast data, and the receivers decrypt the data with the same key. However, the procedure may incur the so-called "1 affects n problem", whereby the action of one member affects the whole group. This is the source of scalability problems. Moreover, from an administrative perspective, it is desirable to confine the impact of membership changes to a local area. In this paper, we propose a novel secure multicast architecture that reduces the impact of the 1 affects n problem significantly by exploiting a cryptographic primitive, "proxy re-encryption". Therefore, we call the proposed secure multicast architecture Sempre (SEcure Multicast architecture using Proxy Re-Encryption). Proxy re-encryption allows intermediate routers to convert the ciphertext encrypted with one key to ciphertext encrypted with another key, without revealing the private key or the plaintext. If the intermediate routers are given proper keys, they can provide separation between subgroups and thereby achieve the goals of scalability and containment. Successful containment reduces the 1 affects n problem significantly. We also compare several related schemes, and discuss some security problems that we identified in them. Existing schemes that use similar techniques only use asymmetric-key algorithms, but the computational costs of the algorithms mean that the schemes are infeasible in practice. Our scheme combines asymmetric-key and symmetric-key algorithms, so it is practical for real-world applications. © ICIC International 2012.

84863269684	A web metering scheme for fair advertisement transactions	Since the rapid development of the Internet, many advertisers would want to introduce their goods on web sites. For achieving fair network advertisement payment, one of payment systems may need to evaluate the number of visited clients for particular web pages. However, advertisers fear that web servers inflate the number of metering. Also, web servers fear to receive a forged witness from a malicious client. If one of the above situations happened, the payment of network advertisement is unfair. In this paper, we propose a userefficiency and fair web metering scheme for ubiquitous environments, where clients can use various intelligent devices to obtain their desired services at any time and any place.

84865424538	A decentralized clustering scheme for transparent mode devices	Clustering multiple devices to form a single powerful device is a common method for improving performance. Most designs of the clustering schemes in the current literature are deploying a traffic splitter in front of devices in the cluster which acts as a centralized job dispatcher splitting workloads to backend devices. In this paper, we propose a decentralized clustering scheme, with no traffic splitter deployed, as an alternative solution on building a cluster system for those devices configured in transparent mode, such as bandwidth controllers, NIPSs, and traffic monitors. Devices in the cluster process the network traffic in parallel in a decentralized manner to scale the throughput. A device can also migrate its workload to others for the purpose of load balance or fault tolerance. Experiment results suggest that the proposed scheme can effectively improve performance of transparent mode devices in terms of throughput, load balance, and fault tolerance. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Through the universal roaming technology, legitimate mobile users can enjoy the ubiquitous services. Mutual authentication and key agreement between mobile users and roaming servers is the primary security issue of many commercial mobile networks. For personal privacy, it becomes an important issue to develop a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme with anonymity for roaming services in global mobility networks to protect user's identity. Recently, many schemes concerned with this issue have been proposed. However, most of those schemes have been demonstrated that may have several security weaknesses and do not achieve user anonymity. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient mutual authentication and key agreement scheme with user anonymity for roaming services in the global mobility network. Under the random oracle model, we show that our scheme can withstand known attacks. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides the secrecy of the session key, strong anonymity of user's identity, and mutual authentication. © 2012 ICIC International.

In contrast, previous literature defines prepayment value as a constant proportion of maintaining value of the mortgage. Finally, based on closed-form pricing formula, we analyze the yield, duration and convexity of risky mortgage loan, providing a better framework for risk management. © 2012 IEEE.

84873450512	Forecasting online game addictiveness	Online gaming has now become an extremely competitive business. As there are so many game titles released every month, gamers have become more difficult to please and fickle in their allegiances. Therefore, it would be beneficial if we could forecast how addictive a game is before publishing it on the market. With the capability of game addictiveness forecasting, developers will be able to continuously adjust the game design and publishers will be able to assess the potential market value of a game in its early development stages. In this paper, we propose to forecast a game's addictiveness based on players' emotional responses when they are first exploring the game. Based on the account activity traces of 11 commercial games, we develop a forecasting model that predicts a game's addictiveness index according to electromyographic measures of players' two facial muscles. We hope that with our methodology, the game industry could optimize the odds of successful investments and target more accurately the provision of a better entertaining experience. © 2012 IEEE.

84873450694	Are all games equally cloud-gaming-friendly? An electromyographic approach	Cloud gaming now makes any computer game playable on a thin client without the previous worries and frustrations about the hardware requirements. It frees players from the need to frequently upgrade their computers as they can now play games that are hosted on remote servers with a broadband Internet connection and a thin client. However, cloud games are intrinsically more susceptible to latency than online games because game graphics are rendered on cloud servers and thin clients do not possess game state information that is required by delay compensation techniques. In this paper, we investigate how the response latency in cloud gaming would affect users' experience and how the impact of latency on players' experience varies among different games. We show that not all games are equally friendly to cloud gaming. That is, the same degree of latency may have very different impacts on a game's quality of experience depending on the game's real-time strictness. We thus develop a model that can predict a game's real-time strictness based on the rate of players' inputs and the game screen dynamics. The model can be used to simultaneously enhance players' gaming experience and optimize the operation cost of data centers. © 2012 IEEE.

84875499464	An adaptive sector-based routing model over structured peer-to-peer networks	It is common that members of a peer-to-peer network join and leave the system at any time. But in a structured peer-to-peer network, frequent joining and leaving may cause huge maintenance overhead. To deal with this churn problem, we proposed a two-tier architecture called adaptive sector-based routing model (ASBRM). In ASBRM the key space is divided into several sectors and each one has a super peer who plays the role of the relay proxy of the sector. When the number of peer members in a sector exceeds a predefined threshold, it will split into two sectors so that the traffic and computational overhead of the super peer can be kept within an acceptable range. For the convenience of explanation, we combine ASBRM with Chord and perform a series of simulations. Both analysis and simulation results show that ASBRM achieves lower communication cost of members' joining and leaving while at the same time the message routing path length is also shortened. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

One appealing feature of the architecture is the ease of integration, that is, the anonymous path is constructed without modifications to the underlying peer-to-peer networks. Moreover, an optional feature called dummy path composition is provided to resist local traffic analysis attack, and there are also two kinds of routing methods with different degree of anonymity to fulfill user requirements. Through analysis and simulations, we show that our system outperforms existing systems on both performance and anonymity. © 2013 ICIC International.

84880057054	Etheragent: Scaling ethernet for enterprise and campus networks	Ethernet is the dominant technology in local area networks due to its simplicity and high performance-to-cost ratio. The flat addressing of Ethernet makes a host can "plug and play" without any configuration adjustment on topology changes and host mobility. Scaling Ethernet to large scale networks such as enterprise, campus, data center, and wide area networks is desirable and widely discussed in recent literature. Unfortunately, Ethernet is suffered from the scalability problem due to the broadcast traffic resulted from many protocols running top of it. To solve this problem, we propose a new device, EtherAgent, to reduce the broadcast traffic in the Ethernet. An EtherAgent is backward compatible so that it can be inserted into an existing Ethernet without any change on protocols, hardware, and software modifications. Simulation results suggest that EtherAgents can significantly reduce broadcast traffic compared with the traditional Ethernet, and they can successfully scale Ethernet to large scale networks. © 2013 ICIC International.

With the advent of ubiquitous Internet access, it is now feasible to ask an Internet crowd to conduct QoE (Quality of Experience) experiments on their personal computers in their own residences rather than in a laboratory. The considerable size of the Internet crowd allows researchers to crowdsource their experiments to a more diverse set of participant pool at a relatively low economic cost. However, as participants carry out experiments without supervision, the uncertainty of the quality of their experiment results is a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourceable framework to quantify the QoE of multimedia content. To overcome the aforementioned quality problem, we employ a paired comparison method in our framework. The advantages of our framework are: 1) trustworthiness due to the support for cheat detection; 2) a simpler rating procedure than that of the commonly-used but more difficult mean opinion score (MOS), which places less burden on participants; 3) economic feasibility since reliable QoE measures can be acquired with less effort compared with MOS; and 4) generalizability across a variety of multimedia content. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework by a comparison with MOS. Moreover, the results of four case studies support our assertion that the framework can provide reliable QoE evaluation at a lower cost. © 1999-2012 IEEE.

84885378475	Aggregate message authentication codes (AMACs) with on-the-fly verification	Aggregate message authentication codes (AMACs) merge multiple authenticators for multiple receivers in multicast networks. We investigate this security notion, revise the definition, derive the lower bound, and present a generic construction through Bloom filters. Different from former research, we especially focus on the new property of AMACs: on-the-fly verification, which means that given the aggregated tag, each single message can be verified without obtaining other messages, i.e., the time for verifying a single message takes time complexity O(1), compared to regular MAC schemes. We derive the security lower bound of such type of AMACs and present a generic approach to build them from essentially any standard MAC scheme by Bloom filter technique. Moreover, we achieve the theoretical lower bound on security strength by adopting optimal compressed Bloom filters. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0141991978	Distributed and on-line routing on tori	In this paper we study the problem of assigning paths to packets on N × N tori in an on-line and distributed fashion. By on-line we mean that the routing decisions must be made without any knowledge of future requests. Being distributed is an equally important feature of our design, for such algorithms need not know the global configuration of the network in the process of routing packets. We use the technique of competitive analysis to measure the performance of our design. In addition to showing an Ω (log N) lower bound on the competitive ratio, we present both deterministic and randomized algorithms which are O (log N) competitive with respect to the maximum load (i.e., congestion) on communication links.

0345547690	Divisible blind signatures based on hash chains	This article presents an efficient divisible blind signature scheme that makes it possible to divide a blind signature with a specified value into a sequence of subsignatures with smaller values for a sequence of different designated verifications. In the proposed scheme every signature can be divided into subsignatures with arbitrary positive values as long as the total value of them is equal to the specified value of that signature. Furthermore, no time-consuming operations such as modular exponentiation operations and inverse computations are required for a user to obtain and verify a divisible blind signature in the protocol. In particular, the proposed scheme can be applied to many interesting communication services, such as anonymous scoring services, divisible electronic cash systems, and multi-recastable voting protocols.

84893037524	Gender swapping and user behaviors in online social games	Modern Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) provide lifelike virtual environments in which players can conduct a variety of activities including combat, trade, and chat with other players. While the game world and the available actions therein are inspired by their offline counterparts, the games' popularity and dedicated fan base are testaments to the allure of novel social interactions granted to people by allowing them an alternative life as a new character and persona. In this paper we investigate the phenomenon of "gender swapping," which refers to players choosing avatars of genders opposite to their natural ones. We report the behavioral patterns observed in players of Fairyland Online, a globally serviced MMORPG, during social interactions when playing as in-game avatars of their own real gender or genderswapped. We also discuss the effect of gender role and self-image in virtual social situations and the potential of our study for improving MMORPG quality and detecting online identity frauds.

84899548697	Understanding potential microtask workers for paid crowdsourcing	More and more people leverage the power of crowds to obtain solutions of their problems, and the number of microtask workers also increases rapidly on paid crowdsourcing marketplaces. However, there is an order of magnitude discrepancy between the population of Internet users (≈ 2 billions) and that of microtask workers (≈ 0.5 millions); we believe that a large number of potential workers are interested in microtasks but have not involved in paid crowdsourcing activities yet. In this paper, we conduct an Internet survey to investigate potential workers regarding their demographics, experiences in microtasks, preferences on tasks and rewards. We hope that our findings from this research are helpful for establishing a prosperous paid crowdsourcing environment. Copyright © 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

84899967451	A reversible acoustic data hiding method based on analog modulation	Steganography is well known as a method of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message. This paper presents a new data hiding scheme that uses a steganographic approach that is based on transforming the data to be covertly transmitted into a high-frequency signal, which is then carried by an audible public music signal. The principle is as follows: The secret message is translated into a digital form, which is then transformed into a high-frequency signal. This high-frequency signal, which is above the threshold of human audibility, is integrated into a public music signal, which can be actively downloaded by legal receivers. The receiver will demodulate the high-frequency signal and recover the data. This proposed scheme greatly reduces the risk of exposure of the secret message during transmission. Experimental simulations and comparisons are performed to investigate the practicability of the proposed method and its outperformance of competing data hiding schemes. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84902505275	A content-protection scheme for multi-layered reselling structures	Since the idea of digital watermarks was proposed, various watermarking schemes have been developed to protect digital contents in electronic transactions. However, most schemes limit themselves to the simplified buyer-seller model that can be applied to only a small number of cases rather than common scenarios in real life. In this paper, a more practical watermarking scheme is proposed to protect digital contents in real-world transactions using PKI (Public-Key Infrastructure). The proposed scheme is considered more practical in the sense that one or more reselling agents may exist between buyers and the original seller, and the seller can package the merchandise in advance without the involvement of buyers. The packaged merchandize can hence be made publicly accessible (e.g., on top of an open shelf) for the purpose of demonstration and circulates in the market. The proposed scheme also preserves the anonymity of the buyers while guaranteeing that the distributor of any illegal copy will be unambiguously identified. © 2004 by Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84903643217	A social diffusion model with an application on election simulation	Issues about opinion diffusion have been studied for decades. It has so far no empirical approach to model the interflow and formation of crowd's opinion in elections due to two reasons. First, unlike the spread of information or flu, individuals have their intrinsic attitudes to election candidates in advance. Second, opinions are generally simply assumed as single values in most diffusion models. However, in this case, an opinion should represent preference toward multiple candidates. Previously done models thus may not intuitively interpret such scenario. This work is to design a diffusion model which is capable of managing the aforementioned scenario. To demonstrate the usefulness of our model, we simulate the diffusion on the network built based on a publicly available bibliography dataset. We compare the proposed model with other well-known models such as independent cascade. It turns out that our model consistently outperforms other models. We additionally investigate electoral issues with our model simulator. © 2014 Jing-Kai Lou et al.

84916927997	Stratus: Check and share encrypted data among heterogeneous cloud storage	A cloud storage service is never sufficient if it only guarantees one of data confidentiality and integrity. Remote storage without encryption could expose private information to outsiders; while storage without integrity could be appended with garbled and useless cipher. This paper presents the Stratus, an integrated encrypted storage atop of heterogeneous cloud storage. Standing on user's perspective, we focus on guaranteeing convenient access and integrity verification to the clouds. Also, Stratus preserves implicitly the folder hierarchy of the original storage and allows painless data migration and sharing without backward decryption. By the technique of dummy list, Stratus is able to perform lazy deletion, reducing access overhead. In particular, we use a novel authentication method, the Binomial Merkle Forests (BMF), to offer a lightweight and public verifiable proof of integrity checking. Other salient features of Stratus include assured deletion and space query in O(log N).

12744259725	A session migration scheme for smart web services in mobile computing	In present times, quite a large number of network applications have been implemented as Web services to take advantage of World Wide Web, the most popular and common platform in the Internet. Although most modern mobile devices are able to connect to the Internet and hence capable of accessing Web services as stationary clients do, they often suffer from performance degradation because of the unawareness of client mobility in the protocol design. In this paper, a session migration scheme is proposed to provide persistent Web services with better service quality and improved availability by dynamically assigning the most appropriate server to each mobile client at any time instant. The proposed scheme avoids introducing extra burden to mobile clients, and the determination of the most appropriate servers can be customized to take a variety of logical and physical metrics into consideration, resulting in a practical and flexible architecture for smart Web services in mobile computing.

84924353201	Give me a broadcast-free network	In computer networking, broadcasting means to transmit a packet to every device in one broadcast domain. Broadcasting is widely used in many protocols, like ARP [1], DHCP [2] and so on. The main reason is that in a distributed network, each node has no knowledge about the whole network. Therefore, the node has to use broadcast ways to build its knowledge. However, for those who do not need to get or answer the broadcast message, the broadcast message is nothing but a noise packet. In this paper, we propose a broadcast handling framework in software defined networking. With this framework, a network manager can minimize the broadcast behavior in the network without impacting hosts. We also implement some broadcast handling modules in this work. We evaluate our framework's performance by comparing our framework with legacy networks and other SDN network platforms. We also discuss the impact of our framework to the spanning tree protocol.

84924405201	An AMI threat detection mechanism based on SDN networks	The security of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) systems draws more and more attention nowadays. Intrusion detection systems are often deployed on the backhaul network to protect the AMI head-end system. In this paper, we proposed an efficient way to build threat detecting mechanism in AMI systems with the help of software defined networks (SDN). Moreover, we also enhance the OpenFlow architecture to provide more powerful detection mechanism to secure the AMI system. The proposed solution not only enhances the security of AMI systems, but also preserves the traffic quality of this structure.
