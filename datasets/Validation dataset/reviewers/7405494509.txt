34250693776	Study on adaptive resonant regulator-based doubly fed driver for variable-speed constant-frequency wind-power generator	In the conventional vector control scheme, the SVPWM means is usually used to modulate DC-link voltage source for excellent DC-link voltage utilization. The operating speed of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), for variable-speed constant-frequency (VSCF) wind power generation, often only varies from 70% to 130% of the synchronous speed, which makes the electromotive force in the rotor circuits low, comparing with one in the power grid, so sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) means is adaptive for the rotor-side converter. Under this condition, a new vector control method, based on the adaptive resonant regulators, is presented, by which the rotor-side currents in the static abc coordinates, being relative to the rotation speed (electrical angular speed), are controlled without steady-state errors, and the decoupling control between the active power and reactive power, flowing between the stator and the power grid, is also achieved.

34447118733	Cut-in/out control strategies for doubly fed induction generator driven by variable-speed wind turbine	Several cut-in control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based variable-speed constant-frequency (VSCF) wind power generation are studied in the paper. The stator voltage open loop control-based cut-in control strategy is easy to be tuned, but the control precision of the no-load stator voltages cannot be guaranteed. In another control strategy with stator voltage RMS close loop control, the control precision is improved, however, the disadvantages in stator voltage symmetry and in no-load stator voltage waving are still not improved very well. The control strategy with stator voltage space vector close loop control not only can guarantee the control precision of the stator voltages, but also can eliminate the stator voltage waving at slip frequency, when a specific controller is adopted. For the voltage space vector close loop control-based strategy, based on the proportional-plus-integral (PI)-based control scheme, a new control scheme composed of an adaptive resonant controller and a PI controller is proposed in the paper, by which the stator voltage waving is almost elimited, and a very well control performance is achieved for stator voltages, naturally, the softly cut-in control is realized. The results of simulation and experiments have validated the theoretical analysis and the designs of the cut-in/out control strategies.

40649101549	Self-localization of mobile robot based on binocular camera and unscented kalman filter	Self-localization is a fundamental requirement for a mobile robot. In indoor environments, the objects are polygonal usually. These objects can be described as line segments. Depth image of the environment can be obtained by a binocular camera automatically. Clustering technology and least-square method have been used to extract features of line segments. The system model and the observation model have been established. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the standard method for parameter estimation and information integration. But the EKF has its flaws. A nonlinear system is linearized to a linear system. So the accuracy of the EKF can only reach to first-order. And the EKF needs to calculate Jacobian matrices. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the EKF, Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) has been used to integrate the data from the odometry and the binocular camera to obtain the accurate pose of the mobile robot. It is proved by experiments that the algorithm based on the UKF is obviously more accurate than the algorithm based on the EKF. Â© 2007 IEEE.

77956540309	Sensorless control for PMSG in direct-drive wind turbines	Permanent magnet synchronous Generator (PMSG) based direct-drive WECS has been attracting wide attentions. For the special application, sensorless control for PMSG is desired. By widely studying the previous contributes, a novel estimator based on back-EMF is proposed. The estimator is composed of back-EMF observer and a phase-lock-loop (PLL) control to get the rotor-flux speed and position. The estimator not only can be used to interior or surface permanent magnet synchronous generators, but also has a compact and symmetrical structure, which makes it be beneficial for implementation. Compared with previous strategies, the EMF observer is independent of the PLL control, which would simplify the observer design. Meanwhile, the proposed estimator is less sensitive to parameter variations. Based on mathematic models of PMSG, the proposed estimator was analyzed in detail, and the realizing process was also presented. To validate the proposed estimator, the important experiment results are reported. Â© 2010 IEEE.

A rectangle detection area was defined on a road lane, but it was displayed as a trapezoid on the images captured by the video camera.

79955063044	Strategy design of multiple feedback loop control for grid-connected voltage source inverter with LCL filter	Although harmonics in AC side of a grid-connected voltage source inverter (VSI) can be filtered out with LCL filter better than with L filter, the three-order characteristic of LCL filter makes the system complicated and unstable. It is found that the power factor and power quality of the grid-connected VSI can be guaranteed only by direct grid-side current control, especially under the non-ideal grid condition. And at the same time, the arm current can be better limited to allowable value of power electronic block by arm current control of VSI, and it is in favor of effective operation of power electronic block. So a cascaded control strategy with multiple feedback loop, namely arm current of VSI, capacitor voltage and grid-side current, is designed in this paper. Meanwhile, in order to restrain the inherent system resonance and increase the damping ratio of LCL filter, a lead-lag element for active damping is added to the inner control loop of arm current of VSI. So a composite multiple feedback control strategy is achieved. Besides, the design method of multiple feedback loop control and the parameter selection of lead-lag element are discussed. The theoretical analysis and design scheme are verified by simulation and experiments on a 11 kW LCL-VSI system. Â© 2011 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.

0141542709	Study on the switching function based simulation of a current source PWM AC/DC converter	The obvious advantage of the simulation software such as Saber and Pspice in analyzing PWM converters is that they can achieve high accuracy by describing the converter circuits with models of real switching devices. Because the switching transience of these devices is modeled by non-linear exponential functions, the simulation is bothered by the problems of large amount of intermediate data, time-consuming, and convergence. The overcome the above problems, the simulation with conventional usage of Matlab is performed by using converter's low frequency models transfer functions, that are built up as Matlab's function modules, resulting reduced accuracy for the ignorance of the switching process. The paper presents a switching function model based method applicable under the Matlab's simulink, in which the switching functions are used to describe the transient behavior of actual switching devices. This method leads to the result of simulation time reduction, convergence and satisfactory accuracy, so that provides an effective method to design and verify the control strategy of PWM converters. As verification, the method is applied to a current-source PWM converter controlled with a new state feedback strategy. The establishment of switching models, and the simulation results of static and dynamic performance are described in detail. The developed methods may be extended to simulation study of various PWM converters.
