79952692845	A pressure-based algorithm for cavitating flow computations	A pressure-based algorithm for the prediction of cavitating flows is presented. The algorithm employs a set of equations including the Navier-Stokes equations and a cavitation model explaining the phase change between liquid and vapor. A pressure-based method is used to construct the algorithm and the coupling between pressure and velocity is considered. The pressure correction equation is derived from a new continuity equation which employs a source term related to phase change rate instead of the material derivative of density Dρ/Dt. This pressure-based algorithm allows for the computation of steady or unsteady, 2-D or 3-D cavitating flows. Two 2-D cases, flows around a flat-nose cylinder and around a NACA0015 hydrofoil, are simulated respectively, and the periodic cavitation behaviors associated with the re-entrant jets are captured. This algorithm shows good capability of computating time-dependent cavitating flows. © 2011 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.

In this paper, we propose a multiprocessor-oriented power-conscious scheduling algorithm for the real-time periodic tasks with task migration constrained scheme. We classify periodic tasks into fixed tasks and migration tasks, and limit the number of migration tasks and the number of destination processors which execute migration tasks. The proposed algorithm is made up of two steps. Firstly, choosing a processor to sort all of the periodic tasks in a non-increasing order according to task utilization, afterwards, allocating them to other processors. Secondly, scheduling the migration tasks with a virtual execution windows policy, and then scheduling the fixed tasks with EDF algorithm. The experiment results show that compared with arbitrary task migration policy and no task migration allowed policy, the power consumption in multiprocessor real-time periodic tasks scheduling is lowered significantly with the proposed algorithm. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The Singhal's cavitation model is adopted combined with an improved RNG κ-ε turbulence model to study the cavitation flow. The thermal effect in the cavitation flow is taken into account by introducing the energy equation with a source term based on the latent heat transfer. The code is validated by a case of a hydrofoil under two different temperatures in a comparison between the simulation and the experiment. Computational results show that the latent heat of vaporization has a significant impact on the cavitation process in the high temperature state, and the cavity in the high temperature state is thinner and shorter than that in a normal state with the same cavitation number, due to the fact that the heat absorption in the cavitation area reduces the local temperature and the saturated vapor pressure.

84855293439	Energy conserving based k-coverage algorithm for dense wireless sensor networks	As the energy supply of wireless sensor is limited, it is important to dynamically configure wireless sensor networks by correctly setting the on/off status of each sensor to let every target be k covered. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient distributed target k-coverage algorithm for dense heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with multiple sensing units. To save the energy of sensors more efficiently, the sensing ability and the remaining energy of a given sensor is integrated to calculate sensor priority. The proposed approach is locally and simultaneously running at each sensor in a rounding mode. Each sensor should decide the on/off status of its sensing units at the beginning of each round, and then transmits this decision to its one-hop neighbours. The higher the priority of a sensor is, the shorter the decision time it needs. Experimental results show that compared with Energy First scheme and Integer Linear Programming solution, our approach has longer network lifetime than Energy First scheme, and the performance of our approach is second only to Integer Linear Programming solution.

84864192415	An improved bacterial foraging optimizer with adaptive and chaotic search	Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) is a new optimization algorithm based on the social foraging behavior of E.coli bacteria. But, the BFO algorithm possesses a poor convergence behavior and search efficiency compared to the other successful nature-inspired algorithms. To improve the performance of BFO algorithm on complex optimization problems, a hybrid BFO algorithm is proposed by incorporating adaptive policy and chaotic search. Firstly, the adaptive chemotactic step size is introduced in BFO to efficiently balance the exploration and exploitation abilities. Secondly, BFO with adaptive chemotactic step size is hybridized with chaos based on tent map to form a novel Adaptive and Chaotic BFO (AC-BFO), which reasonably combines an adaptive searching behavior and a chaotic searching ability. Finally, as compared to BFO, PSO, and GA, the simulations over five numerical benchmarks indicate that the proposed algorithm shows better convergence behavior. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

84908306206	Study on effects of wear-rings clearance modifications on performance of centrifugal pump	Based on the Reynolds time-averaged N-S equations and a RNG k-ε turbulence model, a centrifugal pump was simulated for three schemes of wear-rings clearance modification, i.e. only front wear-ring clearance modified, only rear wear-ring clearance modified, and both clearances modified. Comparison shows a good agreement of the numerical results with experiments. Among the three schemes, the front clearance change has the most significant influence on the performance of centrifugal pump. A change in wear-ring clearances not only has an effect on volumetric loss, but on pump performance. A flow structure analysis shows that the modification effects manifest in the front and rear chambers, also in the outlet of clearances, while insignificant in other sections of the pump. As the clearance widens, a low pressure area in the chamber tends to expand toward the volute and a high-pressure zone near the clearance outlet has a tendency to expand toward the impeller inlet. This further causes an increase in static pressure at the pump inlet and a consequent improvement on the cavitation performance of the pump in high flow conditions.
