17444368048	Cervical meningocele with tethered cervical cord in a Chinese infant	Cervical meningocele and myelomeningocele are rare spinal dysraphic lesions. Unlike lumbosacral dysraphic lesions, there is often no neurological deficit in infants with cervical lesions, thus the subtle features of cervical cord tethering may be overlooked on imaging. We report a case of cervical meningocele in an 8-month-old girl. The tethering band, confirmed intra-operatively, was not evident on imaging. Untethering of the cord was performed together with resection of the sac and repair of the dura. Tethered cord should be suspected in the presence of cervical meningocele and intact neurology. It should be carefully looked for using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Treatment aims to prevent future neurological deterioration, and should include careful intradural exploration with untethering of the cord.

20044364205	Isolated haemorrhagic brain metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma in a 68-year-old man	A solitary brain tumour originating from a lung adenocarcioma in a 68-year-old man is reported. The imaging features were discordant with the clinical picture and prompted surgery and subsequent histological examination. Results of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the lesion was a haematoma. However, during positron-emission tomography using 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose labelled with fluorine 18, the lesion showed predominantly low tracer avidity and an abnormal focus of signal intensity. The resected mass showed a high degree of haemorrhage, and histological examination of the mass revealed features characteristic of a metastatic adenocarcinoma - namely, clearly formed glands and mucin production. For any intracerebral haemorrhage that does not resolve or shows imaging features atypical of haematoma, a histological diagnosis should be sought.

20044371814	Effect of cranial irradiation on pituitary size in patients cured of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: Retrospective study	Objective: To evaluate the pituitary glands of patients previously treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with cranial irradiation. Patients and methods: Thirty nine patients who were cured of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and who were regularly followed up from 1979 to 1992 were recruited. Sagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland was performed in a 1.5-T magnetic resonance machine. Sixteen age- and sex-matched patients who had been treated during childhood for solid extracranial neoplasms with systemic chemotherapy, but not intracranial irradiation, were recruited as controls. Results: The height of the adenohypophysis was significantly smaller in patients who had had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (mean, 3.9 mm; standard deviation, 1.2 mm) than in control patients (mean, 5.3 mm; standard deviation, 1.1 mm) [p<0.001]. For both patients who had had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and for controls, there was no significant correlation between pituitary height and age at diagnosis or age at the time of the study. In the group of patients who had had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the pituitary was shorter in those treated with more than 18 Gy of radiation (mean, 3.0 mm; standard deviation, 1.3 mm) than in those treated with exactly 18 Gy (mean, 4.1 mm; standard deviation, 1.1 mm) [p=0.037]. Conclusion: Children cured of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with previous cranial irradiation show a significant reduction in the height of the adenohypophysis. The effect on the size of the pituitary gland appears greater with a higher radiation dose.

0029922785	Variability of magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography in grading middle cerebral artery stenosis	Background and Purpose: Magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography are new, noninvasive methods to provide images of the cerebral vasculature. The reliability of magnetic resonance angiography when used to grade middle cerebral artery stenosis remains to be established. We sought to study the intraobserver and variabilities of magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomography angiography in grading middle cerebral artery stenosis. Method: A total of 50 middle cerebral arteries in 25 patients were studied with magnetic resonance angiography. All patients had a history of ischemic stroke. The films were read independently by two observers on separate occasions. Films were shown again to the same observer 4 weeks after the first reading. The degree of middle cerebral artery stenosis was categorized into four grades; norma/mild, moderate, severe, and occluded. The interobserver and intraobserver variabilities were calculated by the k statistic method. Results: Interobserver variability for grading middle cerebral artery stenosis was good (κ = 0.78) for magnetic resonance angiography and moderate (κ = 0.51) for computed tomography angiography. There was perfect agreement between two observers in 86% of the vessels shown in magnetic resonance angiography and in 76% of the vessels shown in computed tomography. Intraobserver variability for both imaging methods was good, with the κ value in the range of 0.70 to 0.76. Conclusions: Our results suggest that according to our protocol, magnetic resonance angiography is more reliable than computed tomography angiography in grading middle cerebral artery stenosis.

0030007577	Choledocholithiasis: Comparison of MR cholangiography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography	PURPOSE: To prospectively compare magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) in the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven patients with suspected choledocholithiasis underwent non-breath-hold, heavily T2-weighted, respiratory-triggered turbo spin-echo MR cholangiography. They then underwent ERC within 5 hours. The results of the two procedures were compared in 45 patients. RESULTS: The absence of ductal dilatation was shown in 16 patients at MR cholangiography and at ERC. MR cholangiography showed common duct dilatation in 28 of the 29 patients with dilatation shown at ERC. MR cholangiography helped correctly identify 18 of the 19 patients with choledocholithiasis and 22 of the 26 patients without choledocholithiasis. Sensitivity with MR cholangiography was 95%, specificity was 85%, positive predictive value was 82%, and negative predictive value was 96%. Two of the false-positive findings were due to pneumobilia. CONCLUSION: Non-breath-hold MR cholangiography is as accurate for the evaluation of choledocholithiasis as ERC.

0030731083	Visceral fat and cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese NIDDM patients	OBJECTIVE - The interrelations between obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance are well recognized. These relationships are of particular interest in Hong Kong's Chinese population, in whom increasing affluence has coincided with a marked increase in the prevalence of NIDDM. We designed a pilot study to examine the relationships between visceral fat and cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese NIDDM patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied 21 Chinese NIDDM patients whose visceral fat was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging. Cardiovascular risk factors including plasma lipids and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (BP) were measured. In addition, insulin resistance was determined by a short insulin tolerance test (SITE). RESULTS - Increased visceral adiposity was significantly correlated with plasma triglycerides (r = 0.63, P = 0.004), the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (r = 0.61, P = 0.008), the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (r = 0.49, P = 0.04), and decreased insulin sensitivity as measured by the SITE (r = 0.47, P = 0.03). When the data were analyzed by tertiles, increasing visceral fat area was associated with higher plasma triglycerides, lower HDL cholesterol, and a smaller plasma glucose decrement during the SITT. In addition, the diurnal rhythm in BP and heart rate tended to be best preserved in those with the least visceral obesity. CONCLUSIONS - This pilot study demonstrates that visceral fat accumulation is associated with dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and albuminuria in Chinese patients with NIDDM.

0030808821	MRI and CT of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma causing spinal cord compression	We report the imaging features in five patients with metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma causing spinal cord compression, three of which were biopsy proven and two were in patients with known diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The radiographic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) features are highlighted. Although the occurrence of metastatic disease in hepatocellular carcinoma is exceedingly rare, it may be increasingly encountered as survival of patients is improved with advancing methods of therapy, both surgical and palliative. It often accompanies local recurrence, and invariably signals a grave prognosis with extremely short life expectancy. Unusually, two of the five patients in this series presented initially with skeletal metastases which led to the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

0030876346	Central diabetes insipidus in a newborn with deletion of chromosome 7q	Abstract: We report an infant with midline craniofacial defects and holoprosencephaly due to chromosome 46, XY, del (7) (pter →q34) who presented at 1 week of age with central diabetes insipidus. The importance of hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine investigation in patients with this syndrome, and more generally, in patients with midline craniofacial malformation or holoprosencephaly is emphasized. As infants with chromosome 7q deletion bear close phenotypic resemblance to infants of Trisomy 13, chromosomal confirmation and karyotype banding is mandatory to establish an accurate diagnosis and for genetic counselling of their parents.

0030465893	Role of MIBI breast scintigraphy in evaluation of palpable breast lesions	The sensitivity and specificity of MIBI breast scintigraphy, conventional mammography and ultrasound in differentiating malignant and benign palpable breast lesions was compared in 48 women. MIBI breast scintigraphy had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 69%, a positive predictive value of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 91.7%. Ultrasound and mammography had comparable results with accuracy rates of approximately 93%. We conclude that MIBI breast scintigraphy may have a complementary role in the evaluation of palpable breast lesions, but is not specific enough to replace current imaging modalities.

Axial spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted and Turbo-spin-echo (TSE) T2-weighted images of the upper abdomen of 23 patients suffering from acute cholangitis with known bile duct calculi were retrospectively analysed. Bile duct calculi could be visualized on a T1-weighted SE sequence in 10 (47%) patients. T2-weighted TSE images identified bile duct calculi in 20 (87%) patients. On the T1-weighted sequence, eight out of 10 (80%) visualized common duct stones were slightly hyperintense compared to bile. On T2-weighted sequence, 27 out of 34 (79%) detectable common duct stones were uniformly hypointense compared to bile, but seven stones (21%) had mixed signal intensity.

0030974940	Retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background: This study was done to investigate the size of normal retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) and the incidence of retropharyngeal lymph node involvement in patients with nasopharyngyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Forty-four NPC patients who had not yet received treatment and 20 control subjects underwent MRI scanning. The number and the maximum diameter of the short axis of the cervical lymph nodes were measured. The number of nasopharyngeal walls involved and the maximum diameter of the tumor were recorded. Results: In 5 of 20 control subjects lateral RLN were identified; none of these nodes was greater than 2.5 mm. In the NPC patients, taking 4 mm as the upper limit of normal RLN, 89% of the patients had enlarged RLN. The number of nasopharyngeal walls involved and the maximum diameter of the primary tumor showed no statistical relationship with the involvement of RLN. There was a statistical association between RLN and level II node involvement, but not with other groups of neck nodes. Conclusion: Of all patients with NPC, 89% showed enlarged RLN. Its involvement was related to level II nodes but not to the number of nasopharyngeal sites involved nor with the maximum diameter of the tumor.

0031778341	Body fatness and serum lipids of 11-year-old Chinese children	It has been suggested that distribution of body fat has a stronger beating on health risk than total body fat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to examine the distribution of fat and correlated with body fat assessed by the usual clinical methods-weight, weight-for-height, body mass index (BMI), triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness in 11-y-old Chinese children. Lipid profiles were used as indicators for coronary risk. Eighty- eight subjects had body fat distribution estimated by MRI, while 49 had serum lipids measured. Anthropometric parameters correlated significantly with total fat at the umbilical level measured by MRI (weight: r = 0.90 in boys, 0.75 in girls; BMI: r = 0.94 in boys, 0.87 in girls; percent median weight- for-height: r = 0.90 in boys, 0.79 in girls, triceps skinfold thickness: r = 0.89 in boys, 0.90 in girls; subscapular skinfold thickness: r = 0.93 in boys, 0.88 in girls). Obese subjects had proportionally less visceral fat than subcutaneous fat at umbilical level. Using stepwise multiple regression, predictive factors for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were BMI in boys and breast-staging in girls. For triglycerides, it was genital staging in boys and for total cholesterol, it was breast-staging in girls. Visceral fat was not a significant determinant of serum lipids.

0031785838	Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus in thalassaemic children with elevated serum ferritin levels	Objective: Despite modern treatment with hypertransfusion and chelation therapy, growth retardation continues to be observed in a significant proportion of thalassaemic children. The underlying reason remains unclear, but hypothalamic-pituitary axis disorder has been implicated. We aimed to assess iron overloading in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in thalassaemic children with elevated serum ferritin, with and without growth retardation. Methodology: Twelve thalassaemic children on hypertransfusion and chelation therapy with high serum ferritin were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Five children, all over 10 years of age, had growth retardation. Gradient recalled echo sequence was used to highlight any susceptibility effect that could be due to iron in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. Result: There was no evidence of abnormal hypointense signal in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland in the patients studied, regardless of the presence of growth retardation. Conclusion: There was no apparent characteristic MRI appearances of iron deposition in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland in thalassaemic children with high serum ferritin.

0031827761	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Dynamic MR imaging with gadolinium	Objective: To evaluate the use of enhanced dynamic MR images in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Dynamic enhanced turbo spin-echo transverse images were obtained in 35 patients with newly diagnosed NPC. Comparison was made between the pre-contrast image, last enhanced scan and dynamic series in assessment of the extent of primary tumor and lymph node involvement. Results: Enhanced MR images improved delineation of tumor in the following regions, nasopharyngeal wall (6/35), levator palatini (44/70), tensor palatini (12/70), prevertebral muscles (3/70), medial pterygoid muscle (7/70), pharyngobasilar fascia (30/35), parapharyngeal fat space (23/70), nasal cavity (33/70), oropharynx (6/35), sphenoid sinus (6/35), maxillary sinus (6/70), ethmoid air cells (14/35), cavernous sinus (5/35), cranial fossa (4/35), clivus (13/35) and pterygoid genu (2/70). Eight of the 9 normal and 79/82 abnormal nodal groups, on conventional imaging criteria, enhanced with the same pattern and intensity as the primary tumor. The dynamic series did not improve delineation of tumor extent in comparison with that obtained on last enhanced image. Conclusion: Enhanced MR images are valuable in evaluating the extent of primary tumor. Dynamic imaging was of no additional benefit in the evaluation tumor extent.

0031152036	Comparison of whole body MRI and radioisotope bone scintigram for skeletal metastases detection	Objective To compare whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using fast sequences with radioisotope bone scintigraphy (BS) for the detection of metastases in the entire skeleton. Methods and Results In forty-four patients suffering from carcinoma of lung, breast and prostate whole body MRI could generally be accomplished in about 39 minutes and it was shown to have a higher skeletal metastases detection compared with BS in the spine, pelvis, limb bones, sternum, scapula, and clavicle, but lower in the ribs and skull. Conclusions We think for addressing the status of skeletal metastases only, bone scintigram is still preferred over whole body MRI. When bone scintigram is unavailable, whole body MRI is a practical and acceptable alternative especially when extra-osseous metastases are also of concern.

0031922196	Magnetic resonance cholangiography - feasibility and application in the paediatric population	Objective. To assess the feasibility of magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) in paediatrics. Materials and methods. MRC was attempted in 41 children from 1 week to 14-years. There were three groups: (1) children studied with MRI for non-biliary problems as controls; (2) infants with jaundice; and (3) older children suspected of biliary disease. The examination was successfully performed in 35 children, which included 12 children studied for non-biliary problems, 12 infants with jaundice, and 11 older children with suspected biliary disease. Results. In group 1, the entire common duct was visualised in all 12 children. In group 2, successful demonstration of the common duct was achieved in two of the ten infants with subsequent confirmation of normal bile duct patency. In the last group of patients with suspected biliary disease, MRC gave good anatomical display of six choledochal cysts but failed to demonstrate the anomalous choledochopancreatic channel. It helped to confirm the diagnosis of two cases of pancreatic head cysts, and one case of Caroli's disease. Conclusion. MRC can be applied to the paediatric population, but its value depends on the type of problem to be evaluated. With current spatial resolution, its value in the diagnosis of biliary atresia is probably limited because it cannot reliably demonstrate the bile ducts in young infants with non-obstructive jaundice. In older children, it could provide a non-invasive anatomical display of the biliary tree and its disease. It has a potential role in addressing problematic cases encountered during ultrasonography.

0031225726	Sonographic evaluation of hip effusion in children: Improved visualization with the hip in extension and abduction	Purpose: To assess the difference in the sonographic appearance of hip effusions when the hip was placed in the extended and abducted position as compared to a neutral position. Material and Methods: Twenty-one consecutive children (aged 2-14 years) with hip pain or limping were examined for hip effusions by means of ultrasound. The capsule-femoral-neck distance, the presence of joint fluid, and the shape of the anterior capsule were compared in hips in slight extension and abduction with those in hips in a neutral position. Results: Of the 11 positive hip effusions, the maximal distance between the capsule and femoral neck was significantly larger (p<0.005) in the extended and abducted hip position then in the neutral hip position, with a mean difference of 1.6 mm. Convex bulging of the anterior capsule was more confidently diagnosed in 3 hip effusions in the extended and abducted hip, and better visualization of fluid between the capsule and femoral neck was achieved in 4 joints in this posture. Conclusion: The study demonstrated an improvement in the sonographic detection of hip effusion in the extended and abducted postition compared to the neutral position.

0032067858	Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in a Family with Crouzon's Syndrome	Craniofacial anomalies are recognized causes of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children. Current literature is limited due to rarity of cases. Furthermore, the mechanism of upper airway obstruction is not clearly understood. We would like to report a family (father and 2 sons) who are suffering from Crouzon's syndrome. The two brothers (ages 1 and 3) were found to have significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with failure to thrive. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) markedly improved their OSAS and resulted in accelerated weight gain. The nasoendoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan taken during natural sleep showed that choanal stenosis, maxillary hypoplasia, posteriorly displaced tongue, lengthened soft palate and adenoid tissues were important in the pathogenesis of upper airways obstruction in Crouzon's syndrome. Nasal CPAP improved airway obstruction by opening a narrow slit as demonstrated by MRI. Our results suggest that OSAS occurred in children with Crouzon's syndrome and that nasal CPAP was a useful treatment modality.

0032611126	MR imaging in amyopathic dermatomyositis	Purpose: Amyopathic dermatomyositis is a distinct clinical entity with cutaneous involvement but no myopathy. We conducted a prospective study to investigate the role of MR imaging in these patients. Material and Methods: Out of 40 Chinese patients presenting with dermatomyositis, based on clinical assessment and normal serum muscle enzymes 10 were diagnosed as having amyopathic dermatomyositis. These 10 patients underwent MR imaging for evaluation of any subclinical muscle involvement. Results: Three patients demonstrated abnormal signal intensity in muscles on both T2-and fat suppression sequences. Thus, one-third of patients with dermatomyositis and clinically normal muscles may have detectable muscle inflammation on MR images, indicating that MR has a potential role for locating the relevant biopsy site and for longitudinal follow up. Six of the 10 patients had malignant disease diagnosed before or after diagnosis of the cutaneous manifestation. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma was the most common malignant disease in this group of patients. Conclusion: MR imaging is recommended for demonstrating subclinical muscle involvement in patients with the clinical diagnosis of amyopathic dermatomyositis. We also recommend screening for malignancy, particularly nasopharyngeal carcinoma, in Southern Chinese patients with dermatomyositis.

23844451114	The preferred magnetic resonance imaging planes in quantifying visceral adipose tissue and evaluating cardiovascular risk	Background: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a well-accepted non-invasive method in the quantification of visceral adipose tissue. However, a standard method of measurement has not yet been universally agreed. Objectives: The objectives of the present study were 2-fold, firstly, to identify the imaging plane in the Chinese population which gives the best correlation with total visceral adipose tissue volume and cardiovascular risk factors; and secondly to compare the correlations between single-slice and multiple-slice approach with cardiovascular risk factors. Methods: Thirty-seven Chinese subjects with no known medical history underwent MRI examination for quantifying total visceral adipose tissue volume. The visceral adipose tissue area at five axial imaging levels within abdomen and pelvis were determined. All subjects had blood pressure measured and fasting blood taken for analysis of cardiovascular risk factors. Framingham risk score for each subject was calculated. Results: The imaging plane at the level of 'lower costal margin' (LCM) in both men and women had the highest correlation with total visceral adipose tissue volume (r = 0.97 and 0.99 respectively). The visceral adipose tissue area at specific imaging levels showed higher correlations with various cardiovascular risk factors and Framingham risk score than total visceral adipose tissue volume. The visceral adipose tissue area at 'umbilicus' (UMB) level in men (r = 0.88) and LCM level in women (r = 0.70) showed the best correlation with Framingham risk score. Conclusions: The imaging plane at the level of LCM is preferred for reflecting total visceral adipose tissue volume in Chinese subjects. For investigating the association of cardiovascular risk with visceral adipose tissue in MRI-obesity research, the single-slice approach is superior to the multiple-slice approach, with the level of UMB in men and LCM in women as the preferred imaging planes. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

29044432280	Relative anterior spinal overgrowth in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis - Result of disproportionate endochondral-membranous bone growth? Summary of an electronic focus group debate of the IBSE	There is no generally accepted scientific theory for the etiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). As part of its mission to widen understanding of scoliosis etiology, the International Federated Body on Scoliosis Etiology (IBSE) introduced the electronic focus group (EFG) as a means of increasing debate on knowledge of important topics. This has been designated as an on-line Delphi discussion. The text for this EFG was written by Professor Jack Cheng and his colleagues who used whole spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to re-investigate the relative anterior spinal overgrowth of progressive AIS in a cross-sectional study. The text is drawn from research carried out with his co-workers including measurement of the height of vertebral components anteriorly (vertebral body) and posteriorly (pedicles) in girls with AIS and in normal subjects. The findings confirm previous anatomical studies and support the consensus view that in patients with thoracic AIS there is relatively faster growth of anterior and slower growth of posterior elements of thoracic vertebrae. The disproportionate anteroposterior vertebral size is associated with severity of the scoliotic curves. In interpretating the findings they consider the Roth/Porter hypothesis of uncoupled neuro-osseous growth in the spine but point out that knowledge of normal vertebral growth supports the view that the scoliosis deformity in AIS is related to longitudinal vertebral body growth rather than growth of the canal. In the mechanical mechanism (pathomechanism) they implicitly adopt the concept of primary skeletal change as it affects the sagittal plane of the spine with anterior increments and posterior decrements of vertebral growth and, in the biological mechanism (pathogenesis) propose a novel histogenetic hypothesis of uncoupled endochondral-membranous bone formation. The latter is viewed as part of an 'intrinsic abnormality of skeletal growth in patients with AIS which may be genetic'. The hypothesis that AIS girls have intrinsic anomalies (not abnormalities) of skeletal growth related to curve progression and involving genetic and/or environmental factors acting in early life is not original. While the findings of Professor Cheng and his colleagues have added MRI data to the field of relative anterior spinal overgrowth in AIS their interpretation engenders controversy. Three new hypotheses are proposed to interpret their findings: (1) hypoplasia of articular processes as a risk factor for AIS; (2) selection from the normal population to AIS involves anomalous vertebral morphology and soft tissue factors - this hypothesis may also apply to certain types of secondary scoliosis; and (3) a new method to predict the natural history of AIS curves by evaluating cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) motion at the cranio-cervical junction. What is not controversial is the need for whole spine MRI research on subjects with non-idiopathic scoliosis. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

33644789237	Relative shortening and functional tethering of spinal cord in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? Study with multiplanar reformat magnetic resonance imaging and somatosensory evoked potential	Study Design. MR imaging and multiplanar reconstruction were used to evaluate relative length of the spinal cord to the vertebral column in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Objectives. Ratio of spinal cord length to vertebral column length and position of the cerebellar tonsils were evaluated and correlated with somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (SSEP). Summary of Background Data. Tonsillar herniation, abnormal anthropometric growth, relative spinal overgrowth, and abnormal somatosensory function have been reported in AIS. All these observations suggest a possible neural origin of the etiopathogenesis of AIS, which can be linked to a disproportional growth between spinal column and cord. Methods. Two-dimensional sagittal MRI of the spine was performed in 28 AIS patients (14 mild curve; 14 severe curve) and 14 age-matched controls. Measurements of spinal cord, vertebral column length, and tonsillar position were made on reformat images and correlated with SSEP studies. Results. No significant differences in the absolute spinal cord length were found. However, there was significant relative segmental lengthening of the spinal column at the thoracic level in AIS patients with severe curve; hence, ratios of cord to vertebral column length were significantly reduced (P < 0.01). There was high interobserver reliability (0.9); 28% (8 of 28) scoliosis patients had low-lying cerebellar tonsils and abnormal SSEP, respectively. Conclusion. There was significantly reduced spinal cord to vertebral column ratios in the AIS patients with severe curve, suggesting a disproportional growth between the skeletal and the neural systems. The relative shortening and functional tethering of spinal cord may play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of AIS. ©2006, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain activations associated with external stimulation of the lower Elixir Field in ten normal subjects, and compared the results with the stimulation of their right hands. While right-hand stimulation resulted in left postcentral gyrus activation, stimulation of the lower Elixir Field resulted in bilateral activations including the medial and superior frontal gyrus, middle and superior temporal gyrus, thalamus, insula, and cingulate gyrus. These findings suggest that stimulation of the Elixir Field is not only associated with activation of the sensory motor cortex but also with cortical regions that mediate planning, attention, and memory. © 2006 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

33646371012	Mesenteric fat thickness as an independent determinant of fatty liver	Objective: Mesenteric fat is drained by the portal circulation and has been suggested to be a key component in obesity-related health risk, notably the metabolic syndrome. There are increasing epidemiological and experimental data showing that fatty liver is another component of this multifaceted syndrome. Given their intimate anatomical and physiological relationships, we hypothesized that mesenteric fat thickness may be independently associated with the risk of fatty liver. To test this hypothesis, we examined the predictive role of various fat deposits including mesenteric fat thickness, and various metabolic variables on the risk of fatty liver. Subjects and methods: A total of 291 Chinese subjects (134 men and 157 women with a mean BMI of 23.7 kg/m

33745912502	MR imaging of the brain in patients cured of acute lymphoblastic leukemia - The value of gradient echo imaging	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemosiderin and white matter lesions are 2 of the most common neurologic complications found on MR imaging that may be related to cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX) therapy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We evaluated the brains of patients previously treated for ALL with cranial irradiation and intrathecal MTX with MR imaging and tested the hypothesis that these patients have more MR evidence of central nervous system (CNS) injury than control patients who are in complete remission following systemic chemotherapy without cranial irradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ALL patients recruited from a pediatric cancer center data base were examined at 1.5T by using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, gradient echo (GE), and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences. Patients treated in childhood for solid extracranial neoplasms were used as controls. RESULTS: Lesions consistent with old hemorrhage were detected in 23 (55%) of the ALL patients and in none of the control patients (P <.001). Of the 62 hemorrhages detected on the GE images, only 9 (15%) were shown on T2-weighted images. White matter abnormalities were found in 2 ALL patients (5%) and one control patient (5%). Old infarcts were seen in 2 ALL patients (10%). CONCLUSION: Cerebral hemorrhages related to radiation-induced vascular malformations, most of which are asymptomatic, are much more common in survivors of childhood ALL than previously thought. GE sequencing is more sensitive in detecting hemorrhagic lesions than T2-weighted sequencing and is to be included in imaging protocols for follow-up study of patients after cerebral radiation therapy.

33746885148	Effects of illness duration on memory processing of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy	Purpose: To examine the effects of illness duration on the neural processing of memory in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) by using functional MRI. Methods: Twenty-three TLE patients (16 left, seven right) performed a complex visual scene-encoding task during functional MRI. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses were used to quantity functional activation in the mesial temporal and frontal lobes. The patients' verbal and visual memory performances were evaluated by standardized neuropsychological tests. Analyses included group comparison and correlations of duration of epilepsy with functional activation and memory performance. Results: Compared with normal controls, TLE patients demonstrated reduced activation bilaterally in the mesial temporal lobe (p = 0.003), and the reduction was more pronounced on the ipsilateral side of the seizure focus. Moreover, a longer duration of illness was associated with fewer voxels activated in both the left (p = 0.038) and right (p = 0.017) mesial temporal lobe. Furthermore, the duration of illness was found to be significantly and negatively correlated with both verbal (p = 0.020) and visual (p = 0.000) memory functioning. Conclusions: TLE seems to affect the memory processes in the mesial temporal lobes progressively (i.e., the longer the duration of illness, the lower the brain activation). In turn, the reduction of brain activation negatively affects memory functioning. Finally, the reduction is not limited to the side of seizure but also is observed in the contralateral hemisphere. © 2006 International League Against Epilepsy.

33748488653	Language lateralization of Chinese-English bilingual patients with temporal lobe epilepsy: A functional MRI study	Functional MRI was used to examine language lateralization of Chinese characters and English words associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in Chinese-English bilinguals with left or right TLE. The results suggest that the neural basis of processing Chinese and English seems to be different, as normal controls demonstrated left hemispheric lateralization in reading English words but bi-hemispheric lateralization in reading Chinese characters. This difference in the neural bases of Chinese and English processing was found to affect the patterns in change-of-language processing associated with TLE. That is, whereas left-TLE patients were more likely than right-TLE patients to demonstrate a bi-hemispheric language involvement in reading English, both left- and right-TLE patients demonstrated primarily bilateral hemispheric involvement for reading Chinese characters.

33750714082	Neurologic and radiologic manifestations of three girls surviving acute carbon monoxide poisoning	We report the neurologic and radiologic manifestations of three adolescent girls with acute carbon monoxide poisoning. The girls were found collapsed and unconscious in a bathroom where liquid petroleum gas was being used as heating fuel. As hyperbaric oxygen therapy was not available locally, they only received oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula (4 L/minute) as treatment in the first 2 days. On transfer to a tertiary center in Hong Kong, evolving neurologic manifestations of visual acuity and field deficits, confusion, and focal motor weaknesses were observed. Focal infarctions were evident in cerebral computed tomography in one patient and cortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in all three patients. [

35748971795	Nodes of Rouviere in healthy children: Detectability and size on magnetic resonance imaging and relationship with changes in the paranasal sinuses	Objectives: The visibility and size of the nodes of Rouviere have not been studied in healthy children. The objectives of the present study were to study the size of these nodes in children on magnetic resonance imaging and its relation with changes in paranasal sinuses. Patients and Methods: Ninety five healthy children (58 boys and 37 girls) aged 6.7 to 12.6 years had axial T2-weighted MRI of the brain and upper neck. The long and short axis diameters of Rouviere's nodes were measured. The paranasal sinuses were graded clear, or, when mucosal thickening or fluid was detected in any of the paranasal sinuses, unclear. Results: In 3 children, the left Rouviere's nodes could not be identified. The remaining 187 Rouviere's nodes ranged from 1.0 to 11.3 mm in long axis, 1.0 to 8.0 mm in short axis and 1.0 to 9.2 mm in average nodal diameter. The respective mean and standard deviations were: 6.0 ± 2.2 mm, 4.2 ± 1.4 mm; and 5.1 ± 1.7 mm. There was no statistical difference between the 2 sides (p = 0.4, 2-tailed paired t-test) or between the nodal diameters and age (p = 0.08, 2-tailed Pearson's correlation test). Compared with the children with unclear sinuses (n = 22), children with clear sinuses (n = 73) had significantly smaller long axis (p = 0.004), short axis (p = 0.002), and average nodal diameter (p = 0.002) [2-tailed unpaired t-test]. Conclusions: Over 95% of Rouviere's nodes could be identified on T2-weighled magnetic resonance imaging in healthy children between 6.7 and 12.6 years. The nodal diameters were larger than observed in adults but age-related difference was not observed within the age range studied. Significantly larger nodal size was shown in children with unclear paranasal sinuses. © 2005 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.

0032699828	Late radiation injury to the temporal lobes: Morphologic evaluation at MR imaging	PURPOSE: To study the morphologic characteristics of late radiation injury to the temporal lobes of the brain on magnetic resonance (MR) images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study involving 34 patients (age range, 37-72 years) with known radiation injury to the temporal lobes from radiation therapy administered 2-10 years previously for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MR imaging was performed with T2-weighted gradient- and spin-echo, gradient-recalled echo, T1-weighted spin-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion- recovery, and T1-weighted postcontrast spin-echo sequences. RESULTS: Radiation injury was present in 57 of the 68 temporal lobes. The white matter lesions in radiation-induced injury were predominantly hyperintense on T2- weighted images, but in 37 (65%) of the 57 lobes, loci with heterogeneous signal intensity consistent with necrosis were detected. In the 57 involved lobes, gray matter lesions were detected in 50 (88%); blood-brain barrier disruption based on parenchymal contrast enhancement, in 51 (89%); and hemosiderin deposits, in 30 (53%). There was a significant correlation between white matter necrosis, gray matter lesions, and blood-brain barrier disruption, all of which were located mainly in the inferior temporal lobes that received the highest radiation dose. CONCLUSION: The lesion components of radiation-induced injury to the temporal lobes at MR imaging were more varied than have been previously described. In addition to the classic white matter lesions, gray matter lesions, blood-brain barrier disruption, and hemosiderin deposition also were frequently seen.

0032767466	MRI of local disease in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Tumour extent vs tumour stage	The purpose was to use MRI to study in detail local tumour extension in patients presenting with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and to compare the extent of local disease with the current T-stage classification. MR images of 150 patients with newly diagnosed nasopharyngeal carcinoma were obtained on a 1.5 T unit. 10 extranasopharyngeal sites were analysed for tumour involvement. The number of concurrently involved sites was determined. The extent of tumour invasion was compared with staging as defined by the fifth edition of the AJCC classification. The T-stage distribution was T1 21%, T2 16%, T3 41%:, and T3 22%. The frequencies of tumour invasion into an individual site, and the mean number of other concurrently involved sites were as follows: skull base 63%, 3.9 sites; parapharyngeal 56%, 3.9 sites; nasal cavity 53%, 4.0 sites. oropharyngeal 17%,, 5.2 sites; sphenoid sinus 27%,. 5.6 sites: cranium 21%, 5.7 sites, infratemporal fossa 2%, 6.3 sites; ethmoid sinus 14%, 6.5 sites; orbit 5%, 7.0 sites; maxillary sinus 5%, 7.1 sites, and hypopharynx 0%, 0 sites. Extranasopharyngeal extension commonly occurred superiorly into the skull base rather than inferiorly to the oropharynx (p < 0.0001). Anatomical sites defined within the same T-stage category had different frequencies of involvement and different frequencies of concurrently involved sites. Oropharyngeal involvement (T2 stage) was associated with a number of concurrently involved sites comparable to structures in the T3 category. Maxillary and ethmoid sinus involvement (T3 stage) were associated with a number of involved sites comparable to the T4 stage. Invasion of the maxillary antrum and orbit are markers of the most bulky form of NPC.

0032800415	Correlation between curve severity, somatosensory evoked potentials, and magnetic resonance imaging in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis	Study Design. A prospective study in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis of different clinical severity using whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging and somatosensory evoked potentials. Objectives. To correlate the presence of magnetic resonance imaging structural abnormalities with somatosensory evoked potential-detected functional disorders in the hind brain and spinal cord and the Cobb's angle in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and to compare the result with those in healthy matched control subjects. Summary of Background Data. Many different types of neurologic dysfunction have been reported in scoliosis. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, there are increased reports on the association of idiopathic scoliosis and syringomyelia, Chiari I malformation, or tonsillar ectopia. The actual link between structural and functional disorder in idiopathic scoliosis is, however, unclear. Methods. Posterior tibial nerve evoked potentials and whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 36 healthy control subjects, 135 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with Cobb's angle less than 45 °, and 29 patients with Cobb's angle more than 45 °. Results. Tonsillar ectopia or syringomyelia, detected by magnetic resonance imaging, or functional disturbance in the somatosensory pathway, detected by somatosensory evoked potentials, was found to be significantly more frequent in the group of patients with severe scoliosis curvature, with an incidence of 31% and 27.6%, respectively. Incidence of tonsillar ectopia was 33.3% in patients with abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials in contrast to the much lower incidence of 2.9% in patients with normal somatosensory evoked potentials. There was a significant structural and functional link. The incidence of syringomyelia in patients with and without tonsillar ectopia was 33.3% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusions. In patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with severe curve, the significant association with tonsillar ectopia and abnormal somatosensory function points to a neural origin. Disorders in the somatosensory function may be one of the mechanisms linking tonsillar ectopia to scoliosis. Somatosensory evoked potentials and magnetic resonance imaging may have important diagnostic and predictive value and may help in the management of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

0032845418	Hypoglossal nerve palsy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Background. The aim of the study was to use magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to determine the cause of hypoglossal nerve palsy and the sites of injury in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before radiation therapy and during postradiation therapy follow-up. Methods. The clinical records and MR studies of 21 patients with hypoglossal nerve palsy were retrospectively studied. These 21 patients belonged to a cohort of 387 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (153 with newly diagnosed disease and 234 on postradiation follow-up) who underwent MR imaging in a 2.5-year period. Results. Four patients had hypoglossal nerve palsy at initial diagnosis and all of them had extensive skull base invasion from tumor extending postero- inferiorly to the level of the foramen magnum. The nerve was invaded in the carotid sheath (3), hypoglossal nerve canal (3), and premedullary cistern (1). In 17 patients developing hypoglossal nerve palsy after radiotherapy, only two (12%) had evidence of tumor recurrence. Radiation-induced neuropathy was the probable cause in 14 patients and 1 case was judged indeterminate. MR evidence of fibrosis was demonstrable along the course the nerve in four patients (29%), involving the carotid sheath (4), hypoglossal nerve canal (2), and premedullary cistern (1). No patient had MR evidence of radiation change in the brain stem. Seven patients had a history of a boost dose of radiation to the parapharyngeal region on one or both sides, and nerve palsy occurred on the boosted side in six of them. Conclusion. Hypoglossal nerve palsy on presentation was caused by locally advanced nasopharyngeal tumor whereas a palsy arising after radiation therapy was more frequently caused by postradiation damage rather than cancer.

0032855486	A new management algorithm for impalpable undescended testis with gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance angiography	Purpose: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative localization of impalpable undescended testis using ultrasound and gadolinium (Gd) enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Materials and Methods: Ultrasound and Gd-MRA were performed prospectively in 21 boys (23 impalpable testes) with cryptorchidism before laparoscopy and surgical exploration. Gd- MRA was done using a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner with a turbo field echo technique after bolus intravenous injection of 0.4 mmol./kg, body weight of Gd diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. A total of 10 dynamic scans were acquired during 15 minutes after Gd injection to cover the early arterial and delayed venous phases. All patients subsequently underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and definitive surgery. Results: Ultrasound correctly localized 9 of 10 intracanalicular testes but failed to reveal any intra-abdominal or vanishing testes. In contrast, Gd-MRA correctly localized 4 intra-abdominal, all 10 intracanalicular and 8 canalicular vanishing testes. In 1 patient with an intra-abdominal vanishing testis ultrasound and Gd-MRA failed to make the diagnosis. When correlated with the findings of subsequent laparoscopy and surgical exploration, Gd-MRA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100% for localizing impalpable undescended testes. Based on Gd-MRA and ultrasound findings laparoscopy could have been avoided in 18 of 23 cases (78%). No adverse effect was associated with Gd use in this study. Conclusions: Gd-MRA accurately diagnoses vanishing testes and reliably differentiates intra-abdominal from intracanalicular impalpable testes, allowing definite preoperative planning of the surgical approach and avoiding unnecessary laparoscopy. A new management algorithm for impalpable testis in patients with cryptorchidism is proposed based on ultrasound and Gd-MRA findings.

0032928759	MRI evaluation of multifidus muscles in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis	Background. The role of the multifidus muscles in the initiation and progression of curve in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is not fully understood and controversy exists as to the side of the abnormality. Objective. To evaluate on MRI the multifidus muscles at the apex of the major curve in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis to ascertain if the multifidus muscles on the convex or concave side are abnormal and the relationship to curve severity. Materials and methods. Forty-six patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, separated into two groups, were studied using a 1.5-T MR scanner with the synergy spine coil, employing a modified STIR (short tau inversion recovery) axial sequence obtained at the apex of the major scoliotic curve. Results. No hyperintense signal change was demonstrated in the convex side multifidus muscles in any patient. In group I, 16 of 18 patients with severe or rapidly progressive curve showed increase in signal intensity in the multifidus muscle on the concave side of the apex of the curve. In group II, of the 15 patients with mild curve (Cobb angle 10-30°), 4 had increased signal intensity in the multifidus muscle on the concave side; of the 13 with more severe curve (Cobb angle greater than 30°), 10 had increase in multifidus signal intensity on the concave side. Conclusions. The concave-side multifidus muscle at the apex of a scoliotic curve was morphologically abnormal. A significant association between abnormal signal change and curve severity was also established.

0033755380	Use of transcranial doppler ultrasound to predict outcome in patients with intracranial large-artery occlusive disease	Background and Purpose - Intracranial large-artery occlusive disease is the predominant vascular lesion found in stroke patients of Asian, African, and Hispanic ancestry, making it numerically perhaps the most common vascular cause of stroke in the world. Relatively little is known about the clinical significance of finding such lesions. We investigate whether the presence and the extent of these vascular lesions help predict outcome after stroke. Methods - On the basis of transcranial Doppler of the intracranial arteries with supplementary duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries, we determined the number of occlusive arteries in the craniocervical circulation of consecutive patients who were hospitalized for acute cerebral ischemia. Patients were followed for 6 months for further vascular events (including transient ischemic attack, stroke, and acute coronary syndrome) or death. Results - Among 705 consecutive Chinese patients studied, occlusive arteries were found in 345 patients (49%): 258 patients (37%) had intracranial lesions only, 71 (10%) had both extracranial and intracranial lesions, and 16 (2.3%) had extracranial lesions only. Sixty-three (18%) of the 345 patients with occlusive arteries and 35 (9.7%) of the 360 patients without occlusive arteries had further vascular event or death within 6 months. The risk of vascular events or death increased rapidly with rising numbers of occlusive arteries, after adjustment for vascular risk factors and stroke severity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.25 per occlusive artery, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.39). Other independent risk factors included age (OR 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05) and atrial fibrillation (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.40 to 6.69). Conclusions - In patients with predominantly intracranial large-artery occlusive disease, the presence and the total number of occlusive arteries in the craniocervical circulation predict further vascular events or death within 6 months after stroke. Transcranial Doppler ultrasound is an important investigation for the evaluation of patients with stroke in populations at risk of intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

0033775827	Diagnostic accuracy of abdominal ultrasonography compared to magnetic resonance imaging in siderosis of the spleen	A prospective study to compare the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography with magnetic resonance imaging using gradient-recalled echo technique in cases of siderosis of spleen was conducted in 53 cirrhotic patients with endoscopic proof of gastroesophageal varices. Of the 34 patients with splenic siderosis on MR imaging, punctate hyperechoic foci were detected in the spleen on ultrasonography in 24 patients. Using MR imaging as the reference standard for the diagnosis of splenic siderosis, the sensitivity of ultrasonography is 70.6%; specificity is 78.9%; positive predictive value is 85.7%; and negative predictive value is 40%. We conclude that ultrasonography is a fairly accurate technique in the diagnosis of splenic siderosis.

0033914671	Alveolar hypoventilation syndrome in brainstem glioma with improvement after surgical resection	A 3-year-old boy presented with brainstem astrocytoma and central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome. Contrast MRI of the brain showed that the tumor involved the cerebellum, with compression of brainstem, and resolved after surgical resection. Polysomnography performed before and after total tumor resection showed significant improvement in nocturnal respiratory rate, respiratory disturbance index, and oxygen desaturation. It is apparent that central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome secondary to brainstem tumor may improve after surgical resection for those with favorable anatomic location and histology. Serial polysomnography and MRI scans are useful for diagnosis and in the management plan, and to monitor progress.

0033994159	Neck node metastases from nasopharyngeal carcinoma: MR imaging of patterns of disease	Background. The purpose was to use MR imaging to document the patterns of nodal involvement in the upper neck in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods. The MR images of 150 patients with newly diagnosed NPC were reviewed retrospectively. Nodes were considered abnormal on MR criteria of size, necrosis, and extracapsular spread. Results. Retropharyngeal nodes (RN) were more frequently involved than nonretropharyngeal nodes (NRNs) (94% vs 76% in 115 patients with nodal metastases). NRN involvement without RN was seen in only 7 of 115 patients (6%). Involvement of RN at the level of the oropharynx (82%) was as common as at the nasopharynx (83%) level. Internal jugular nodes were the most frequently involved NRN nodes (72%). Spinal accessory nodal involvement was also common (57%) but seldom in isolation (8%). Submandibular (3%) and parotid (2%) nodal metastases were uncommon and were always associated with advanced nodal metastases in the ipsilateral RN, internal jugular, and spinal accessory regions. Conclusion. Retropharyngeal nodes are the first echelons of nodal metastases. Direct lymphatic spread to the neck without involvement of the RN nodes is uncommon. RN metastases at the level of the oropharynx are more common than previously suspected, and this should influence radiotherapy planning. NRN outside the internal jugular and spinal accessory chains are rare and only occur when the usual routes of lymphatic spread have already been blocked by tumor. (C) 2000 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

33644859877	Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MR imaging in late radiation-induced injury of the brain	The objective of the study was to evaluate radiation-induced cerebral injury on dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSCE) perfusion MR imaging and study its relationship with morphological severity and disease progression. Thirty-one patients with known radiation injury to the temporal lobes where studied. Gradient and spin-echo T2-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and DSCE perfusion MR imaging were obtained in the coronal plane through the anterior temporal lobe. Regions of interest where selected in the anterior temporal lobes and the superior frontal lobe as control for analysis of perfusion parameters. The mean transit time (MTT) was prolonged in both the High Dose Zone (HDZ) receiving from two-thirds to the total dose of 66-71. 2 Gy, and the Intermediary Dose Zone (IDZ) receiving up to 87% of the total dose. The HDZ but not the IDZ showed a low relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and relative cerebral blood flow index (rCBFi). The rCBV and rCBFi were significantly lower in both HDZ and LBZ in temporal lobes with severe lesions compared to the temporal lobes with mild lesions but there was no significant difference in bolus transit parameters. The rCBV and rCBFi were significantly lower in both HDZ and IDZ of the swollen temporal lobes compared to those without swelling. It was concluded that DSCE perfusion MR imaging demonstrated a derangement in perfusion in radiation-induced cerebral injury in rCBV, rCBFi and MTT, which were related to the severity of the radiation-induced injury and the dose of irradiation delivered. © 2005 Springer-Verlag.

0034958366	Deferoxamine-induced dysplasia of the knee: Sonographic features and diagnostic performance compared with magnetic resonance imaging	Objective. To evaluate the features and diagnostic performance of sonography in the assessment of deferoxamine-induced dysplasia of the knee. Methods. The left knees of 32 patients with thalassemia who were receiving regular blood transfusions and chelation therapy were studied with sonography for signs of deferoxamine-induced bone dysplasia. Abnormal physeal and metaphyseal changes detected on sonography included notching at the metaphyseal corner, a blurred or irregular peripheral juxtaphyseal metaphyseal contour, and widening of the peripheral juxtaphyseal metaphyseal echogenic interface. The accuracy of sonography in diagnosing dysplasia was evaluated by using magnetic resonance imaging as the standard of reference. Results. There were 14 true-positive findings, 10 true-negative findings, 7 false-negative findings, and 1 false-positive sonographic diagnosis of dysplasia, giving 67% sensitivity, 91% specificity, a 93% positive predictive value, and a 59% negative predictive value. Conclusion. Sonography was specific but only moderately sensitive in the diagnosis of deferoxamine-induced dysplasia at the knee when compared with magnetic resonance imaging.

0034720874	Aspirin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage: Clinical and radiologic features	Objective: To identify the clinical and radiologic features of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in aspirin users. Background: Although the benefits of aspirin outweigh its hemorrhagic risks for patients at high risk of vascular diseases, prolonged use of aspirin is associated with an increased risk of ICH. Methods: The authors enrolled consecutive patients with acute stroke who were admitted to a regional hospital from 1993 to 1998 into a stroke registry. From this registry, they identified all stroke patients who had ICH confirmed by CT scan and then selected those taking regular aspirin before ICH as the study group. For each study patient, they selected the immediate next two patients with ICH but not taking aspirin as controls. Results: The authors identified 58 aspirin users and 1193 nonusers among all patients hospitalized for ICH. From the group of nonusers, they selected 116 patients as controls. The locations of the hematoma were different (p = 0.002), with more lobar hematoma in the aspirin group (32.8%) than in the control group (10.3%). Prior cerebrovascular disease was the reason for taking aspirin in 37 (64%) patients but five patients had prior ICH. Conclusions: The propensity for lobar hematoma in aspirin-associated ICH suggests its pathology may be somewhat different from spontaneous ICH among nonaspirin users. Further research to examine the risks and benefits of aspirin use in certain subgroups at risk of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events is needed.

Patients and Methods: The study population comprised 19 subjects with previous sonographic diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, who had repeat magnetic resonance imaging examinations for the quantification of the degree of liver fat content by signal intensity change in liver on breath-hold gradient echo in-phase and opposed-phase imaging. Results: In the first examination, the range of percentage signal loss was from -3.6% (signal gain) to 84.8%, with a mean of 27% and a standard deviation of 25.6%. In the repeat examination, the range of percentage signal loss was from -8.9% to 85.9%, with a mean of 25.7% and a standard deviation of 26.1%. The standard error of measurement was 2.9%. Correlation of measurements in signal change between the two examinations was high (r = 0.99). Conclusions: The quantitative assessment of hepatic steatosis on gradient echo in-phase and opposed-phase magnetic resonance imaging showed high reliability on repeat examinations. © 2005 Hong Kong College of Radiologists.

4444351847	Comparison of breath-hold 2D phase-contrast with non breath-hold cine phase-contrast MRA in file assessment of azygos venous blood flow in portal hypertension	Azygos venous blood flow as an index of blood flow through the gastroesophageal collaterals and varices is of value in the prediction of gastrointestinal bleeding. Measurement of azygos venous blood flow has been achieved by non breath-hold (NBH) cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging. The objective of this study was to compare the faster breath-hold (BH) phase-contrast technique with the standard (NBH) cine phase-contrast technique in the measurement of azygos blood flow. Thirty-two cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices were examined by magnetic resonance imaging using a BH technique and a NBH cine phase-contrast technique to measure the flow velocity, flow volume and calibre of the azygos vein at the mid-right atrial level. The flow values were obtained on the velocity image of the phase-contrast study. Values obtained from the two methods were evaluated statistically for the strength and significance of correlation by the Pearson test. Measurement by the BH method performed at full-inspiration as well as end-expiration was also obtained in 15 healthy volunteers. The breath-hold phase-contrast method has significant but weak correlation with non BH cine phase-contrast method in the measurement of azygos venous blood flow volume (r = 0.55, p < 0.01) and flow velocity (r = 0.43, p = 0.01). However, the calibre of the azygos vein gave a strong correlation in these two methods (0.82). In the subgroup of patients whose azygos blood flow velocity was greater than 7.4 cm/s, the correlation of azygos blood flow volume is strong (r = 0.80, p < 0.01). The azygos vein calibre remains highly correlated between the BH and NBH method, in both high flow velocity (r = 0.73) and low flow velocity (r = 0.83) groups. Breath-hold sequence leads to higher values for flow velocity and flow volume in the cirrhotic patients and also the control group. In patients with portal hypertension, BH 2D phase-contrast (PC) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) could give a comparable estimation of the calibre of the azygos vein as the NBH 2D cine PC MRA but not for azygos flow volume. In patients with high azygos flow velocity, the strong correlation in flow volume between the BH and NBH method suggests that the BH method may be a time-saving alternative to the NBH method.

70349671307	Pre- and postoperative fMRI and clinical memory performance in temporal lobe epilepsy	Objective: The present study aimed to examine and compare memory processing in patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) before and after surgery using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: Seventeen preoperative patients with unilateral TLE (nine left, eight right) and eight healthy controls were recruited. They performed a complex visual scene-encoding task during fMRI to measure memory activation in the mesial temporal lobe. Their memory performance was evaluated using standardised neuropsychological tests. After unilateral temporal lobe resection (either temporal lobectomy, selective amygdalohippocampectomy or lesionectomy), the same fMRI paradigm and neuropsychological tests were administered to the patient group. Results: Left-TLE patients demonstrated a decline in verbal memory after left temporal lobe resection. Their postoperative verbal and visual memory performance was positively associated with postoperative functional activation in the right mesial temporal lobe, whereas the postoperative memory performance of right-TLE patients was positively associated with postoperative functional activation in the left mesial temporal lobe, contralateral to their respective side of resection. Conclusion: Postoperative memory performance was significantly associated with functional activation contralateral to the side of resection in patients with unilateral TLE, and the function of the contralateral mesial temporal lobe might play an important role in supporting memory performance after temporal lobe resection.

0034520518	Desferrioxamine-induced long bone changes in thalassaemic patients - Radiographic features, prevalence and relations with growth	Aim: To study the radiographic findings of desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia, its prevalence and relation to growth in thalassaemic patients. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 35 thalassaemic patients on a hypertransfusion scheme and chelation therapy at a dose not exceeding 50 mg/kg/day. Radiographs of the left hand taken for bone age assessment in consecutive patients over the past 12 months were evaluated for signs of desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia. The findings were correlated with data on growth, chelation and body iron content. Results: Twelve of 35 patients had evidence of desferrioxamine-induced long bone dysplasia. There was no significant difference in the groups with and without radiographic evidence of bone dysplasia with respect to the height percentile at time of initiation of therapy, height percentile at time of radiography, skeletal age delay, age at starting chelation, chelation dose and duration, units of blood transfused, average chelation dose, and serum ferritin levels at time of radiography. Both groups showed a reduced percentile growth with a significantly greater reduction (P = 0.03) in the patients with dysplastic change. Conclusion: Desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia is associated with height reduction and can be seen in patients receiving desferrioxamine chelation therapy at doses of less than 50 mg/kg/day. Awareness of the diagnosis is of importance as reduction of the desferrioxamine dose may improve bone growth. © 2000 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0035248680	Comparison of non-breath-hold high resolution gadolinium-enhanced MRA with digital subtraction angiography in the evaluation on allograft renal artery stenosis	Aim: The study objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of non-breath-hold high resolution gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (Gd-MRA) with intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in the evaluation of allograft renal artery stenosis (ARAS). Materials and Methods: We studied 17 renal transplant recipients (six men, 11 women, age 34-64 years) with a systolic bruit in the transplant region beyond the early post-operative period. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography was performed by non-breath-hold high resolution 3D acquisition in the oblique coronal plane using a 256 x 512 matrix. Digital subtraction angiography was performed with AP and oblique views and ARAS was graded as ≤50% or >50% diameter stenosis on the view that displayed the maximal narrowing. Results: Digital subtraction angiography showed >50% stenosis in seven patients, all of whom were diagnosed correctly on Gd-MRA. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography diagnosed two patients with >50% stenosis which were not confirmed on DSA. Eight patients had no or ≤50% stenosis on both Gd-MRA and DSA. The sensitivity and specificity of Gd-MRA in revealing >50% stenosis were 100% and 75%, respectively, using DSA as the gold standard. Conclusion: High resolution Gd-MRA employing a non-breath-hold technique is highly sensitive in the diagnosis of ARAS greater than 50%. It is preferred as a non-invasive screening technique to DSA in suspected ARAS. © 2001 The Royal College of Radiologists.

75249104356	Cerebral motor cortical mapping: Awake procedure is preferable to general anaesthesia	Objective: To investigate the outcome of surgical resection of cerebral lesions near or at the motor cortex under general anaesthesia or in the awake condition. Methods: Patients undergoing motor cortical mapping for tumour surgery were recruited. Surgery was carried out according to the cortical mapping protocol of the centre. Tumour location, stimulation threshold, extent of resection and postoperative complications, including neurological deficits and seizure, were recorded. Results were categorized in the awake group and in the general anaesthesia (GA) group for analysis. Results: From February 2003 to July 2006, 28 patients suffering from brain tumour (24 glioma, two metastasis and two cavernoma) were indicated for motor cortical mapping to facilitate safe tumour removal.Eight patients were in the GA group. Five tumours were subcortical lesions, whereas three were cortical lesions. There were 20 patients in the awake group. Three tumours were subcortical, whereas 17 were cortical lesions. The mean stimulation threshold was 10.75 mA (5-16 mA) in the GA group and 7.7 mA (4-12 mA) in the awake group. There were four early postoperative seizures, two transient (3-month) deficits and four permanent deficits in the GA group. One early postoperative seizure, five transient deficits and no permanent deficits were recorded in the awake group. All the permanent deficits were associated with subcortical tumours and were in the GA group. Seventy five percent of the patients achieved radiological total removal and an average extent of resection of 94.15% was achieved in the awake group. Only 37.5% of patients achieved radiological total removal and the average of extent of resection was 64.1% in the GA group. Conclusions: General anaesthesia was associated with high postoperative permanent deficit despite the effort of motor cortical mapping. Higher rate of early postoperative seizure was also found in the GA group. Awake motor cortical mapping was safer and was associated with fewer complications. We suggest that awake motor cortical mapping is preferable to the general anaesthetic technique. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong.

0035502326	Liver iron estimation in β-thalassaemia: Comparison of MRI biochemical assay and histological grading	Aims: The aims of the study were to compare the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biochemical assay and histological grading in estimating liver iron content, and to evaluate the value of liver to muscle signal intensity ratio (L/M ratio) on spin-echo T1-weighted images in this role. Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine homozygous β-thalassaemics had their L/M ratio measured on MRI, followed by ultrasound-guided liver biopsies with histological grading of iron storage and biochemical quantification of liver iron concentration (LIC-b) using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: A significant difference in L/M ratios between the four grades of iron storage on histology was observed (P < 0.001). The coefficient of correlation was -0.67 between L/M ratio and LIC-b ranging from 2 to 21.6 mg/g dry weight. Specific values of L/M ratio reliably reflected liver iron content at clinically important levels. A L/M ratio of < 0.6 has 86% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the prediction of grade 3 or 4 iron storage histologically and 81% sensitivity and 81% specificity in predicting LIC-b > 15 mg/g. A L/M ratio of > 0.8 predicts a histological iron storage grading of 0 or 1 with a 100% sensitivity and 74% specificity. Conclusion: L/M ratio on MRI is of value as a non-invasive alternative to repeated liver biopsies for estimating liver iron content at clinically important thresholds. © 2001 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0036085054	Optimal values of flow velocity on transcranial Doppler in grading middle cerebral artery stenosis in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography	Background and purpose. To investigate the optimal values of flow velocity on transcranial Doppler (TCD) in grading the severity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis in comparison with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Methods. Both TCD and MRA examinations were performed on 148 asymptomatic patients. The peak flow velocities of each MCA were recorded. Severity of MCA stenosis on MRA was classified as normal-mild (< 50% lumen diameter reduction), moderate (50%-75%), and severe-void (> 75% and void of flow signal). Results. Among 296 MCAs evaluated, normal-mild stenosis was found in 75 (25%), moderate stenosis in 112 (38%), and severe stenosis in 109 (37%). The mean of systolic velocity (Vs) of MCA differed significantly among these three groups: mean Vs = 121.83 ± 22.52 cm/s in the normal-mild group; 155.96 ± 21.62 cm/s for the moderate group; and 199.39 ± 43.86 cm/s for the severe group (P < .001). The optimal cutoff velocity for detection of MCA (> 50%) stenosis was found at Vs > 140 cm/s on TCD (area under the ROC curve is 0.87, P < 0.001). The best cutoff points for grading severity of on TCD were 140 cm/s and 180 cm/s. Conclusion. TCD enables grading of the severity of MCA stenosis according to the flow velocity. This method provides a noninvasive and reliable method for grading MCA stenosis and allows longitudinal monitoring of the relationship between clinical outcome and hemodynamic change.

0036163385	Progression of middle cerebral artery occlusive disease and its relationship with further vascular events after stroke	Background - Serial changes of flow velocities of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) in symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusive disease may be related to the occurrence of further vascular events, but prospective data are lacking. Methods - We conducted a prospective study on patients with cerebral ischemia who were hospitalized with symptomatic MCA stenosis or occlusion. We repeated TCD examinations 6 months after the initial examinations and recorded any stroke or coronary events during this period. The changes of MCA flow velocities were categorized as normalized artery, stable artery, and progressed artery, which were determined according to the changes of MCA velocities at 6 months. Results - We studied 143 consecutive patients who had relevant MCA occlusive diseases (107 with stenosis and 36 with occlusion). At 6 months, the velocities in the MCA returned to normal in 42 patients (29%), they were stable in 80 patients (62%), and they progressed in 13 patients (9%). The number of clinical events varied significantly among the 3 groups: there were 2 patients (4.8%) with clinical events in the normal group, 11 patients (12.5%) with clinical events in the stable group, and 5 patients (38.5%) with clinical events in the progressed group (P=0.004). The 18 recurrent events included 10 recurrent strokes, 5 transient ischemic attacks, and 3 acute coronary syndromes. Conclusions - Progression of MCA occlusive diseases is associated with an increased risk of vascular events. Further studies are required to establish the value of serial TCD examinations in predicting future clinical events.

0035717242	A pilot study of microembolic signals in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis	Objective. There has been limited data on the frequency of microembolic signals in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis, especially during the acute phase of stroke. Using transcranial Doppler, the authors prospectively monitored the MCA segments distal to stenosis in 4 groups of patients for 30 minutes: (1) symptomatic patients with acute ischemic stroke and MCA stenosis, (2) asymptomatic group patients with asymptomatic MCA stenosis, (3) control patients with acute ischemic stroke of undetermined etiology, and (4) normal people. A total of 60 patients completed the study. There were no microembolic signals in the asymptomatic, control, and normal groups, Among 20 patients in the symptomatic group, microembolic signals were detected in 3 patients (15%). The number of emboli ranged from 1 to 6 per 30 minutes. This is the first report of the presence of microembolic signals in acute stroke patients with MCA stenosis.

0036289434	Mechanisms of acute cerebral infarctions in patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis: A diffusion-weighted imaging and microemboli monitoring study	Although most therapeutic efforts and experimental stroke models focus on the concept of complete occlusion of the middle cerebral artery as a result of embolism from the carotid artery or cardiac chamber, relatively little is known about the stroke mechanism of intrinsic middle cerebral artery stenosis. Differences in stroke pathophysiology may require different strategies for prevention and treatment. We prospectively studied 30 consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with middle cerebral artery stenosis detected by transcranial Doppler and magnetic resonance angiography. Patients underwent microembolic signal monitoring by transcranial Doppler and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Characteristics of acute infarct on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were categorized according to the number (single or multiple infarcts) and the pattern of cerebral infarcts (cortical, border zone, or perforating artery territory infarcts). The data of microembolic signals and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were assessed blindly and independently by separate observers. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging showed that 15 patients (50%) had single acute cerebral infarcts and 15 patients had multiple acute cerebral infarcts. Among patients with multiple acute infarcts, unilateral, deep, chainlike border zone infarcts were the most common pattern (11 patients, 73%), and for single infarcts, penetrating artery infarcts were the most common (10 patients, 67%). Microembolic signals were detected in 10 patients (33%). The median number of microembolic signals per 30 minutes was 15 (range, 3-102). Microembolic signals were found in 9 patients with multiple infarcts and in 1 patient with a single infarct (p = 0.002, X

0036525953	Hepatic malignant tumour versus cavernous haemangioma: Differentiation on multiple breath-hold turbo spin-echo MRI sequences with different T2-weighting and T2-relaxation time measurements on a single slice multi-echo sequence	Aim: We evaluated the signal intensity change on breath-hold turbo spin-echo (TSE) T2-weighted sequences using different echo times (TE) and T2-relaxation time measurements on a single slice eight-echo sequence in the differentiation of hepatic malignancy from cavernous haemangioma. Materials and methods: Breath-hold TSE T2-weighted axial images of the liver were performed at TEs of 80, 120 and 160 ms in 34 patients with focal liver lesions (13 with cavernous haemangiomas, 14 with hepatocellular carcinomas and seven with metastases). The lesion percentage signal intensity change on the lower TE image to the higher TE image was calculated. T2-relaxation time was measured on a single slice eight-echo sequence. Results: The TE pair 80/160 ms on breath-hold TSE T2-weighted sequences gave a performance (100% sensitivity, 92% specificity, 95% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value) better than other TE pairs in differentiating haemangioma from malignancy. Addition of fat-suppression compromised the diagnostic performance for all TE-pairs. The use of T2 relaxation time threshold of < 112 ms as indicative of malignant lesion achieved a 100% sensitivity, 77% specificity, 88% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Conclusion: Percentage signal intensity change on breath-hold TSE T2-weighted sequences at TE 80/160 ms appears to be a quick and potentially useful means of differentiating hepatic malignancy from haemangioma. © 2002 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0036848481	Pseudoaneurysm complicating osteochondromas: Symptom relief with embolization	Pseudoaneurysm is a recognized vascular complication of osteochondromas. The diagnosis is confirmed by various imaging techniques including ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and conventional angiography. Surgical repair and excision of the adjacent osteochondroma is considered the treatment of choice. The authors report a case of successful transarterial embolization using helical microcoils in the treatment of osteochondroma-related pseudoaneurysm of the superficial femoral artery. It resulted in complete obliteration of blood flow to the pseudoaneurysm and good symptomatic relief before subsequent semielective surgery. No complication was encountered during the procedure. Transarterial embolization is a safe mode of treatment in experienced hands. In patients with contraindications to surgery, embolization may be considered a definitive treatment.

0036901507	Back pain in pregnancy - Magnetic resonance imaging correlation	Aim: To study the relationship of disk abnormality and signal changes of the uterine cervix on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with back pain in pregnancy at 36-39 weeks of gestation. Material and methods: One hundred and five pregnant Chinese women with previous Caesarean section at 36-39 weeks gestation undergoing magnetic resonance pelvimetry performed for a study for trial of vaginal delivery were questionnaired for back pain. Sagittal T2-weighted images were analysed for intervertebral disk abnormality, and signal intensity of the uterine cervix on the same sagittal images. The findings on MRI were correlated with back pain. Results: Seventy-three (70%) of the pregnant women had back pain. Disk bulge or prolapse were infrequent but correlated significantly with the presence of back pain (P = 0.02). Women with back pain in the current pregnancy tended to have a higher signal intensity of the uterine cervix compared with those without (P = 0.006). Women with a history of back pain also had higher cervical signal intensity compared with those without (P = 0.02). Conclusion: Disk bulge or prolapse was associated with back pain in pregnancy but were relatively infrequent. The significant correlation of high signal intensity in the uterine cervix and back pain suggested that soft tissue laxity may be a more important cause of back pain in pregnancy than disk bulge or prolapse. © 2002 The Royal College of Radiologists.

0037412849	Progress of memory function after radiation therapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	The authors evaluated the late neurocognitive profile and progress of memory functions in 60 patients with primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had been treated with radiation therapy for more than 2 years. Forty had imaging evidence of temporal lobe injury (TLI-positive), and 20 did not (TLI-negative). The patients and 19 healthy control subjects, matched with the patients for age and educational level, underwent extensive memory assessments. Seventeen patients (10 TLI-positive, 7 TLI-negative) were reassessed after an average of 28 months for progress of memory functions. The patient groups performed significantly worse on most memory tests compared with the normal subjects. Patients with memory complaints had lower scores for verbal memory than those without such complaints. The TLI-positive and TLI-negative groups did not differ significantly from each other in cognitive performance. At follow-up, visual memory performance had deteriorated, while verbal memory remained more stable.

0036938971	Patterns of bone diseases in transfusion-dependent homozygous thalassaemia major: Predominance of osteoporosis and desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia	Objective. To study the radiographic skeletal changes in transfusion-dependent homozygous β-thalassaemia. Materials and methods. This was a retrospective review of radiographs of 41 homozygous β-thalassaemic patients over 3 years. These included 55 left hand radiographs for bone age, 37 chest radiographs, 7 scanograms of lower limbs, 8 knee radiographs and 3 skull radiographs. The radiographs were evaluated for the skeletal changes owing to medullary expansion, as well as for the skeletal dysplasia related to desferrioxamine therapy. The combined cortical width of the mid shaft of the second metacarpal was measured on left hand radiographs to assess osteoporosis. Results. Sixteen patients had radiographic evidence of desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia. These included metaphyseal sclerosis in long bone (n = 16), irregular sclerosis at the costochondral junction (n = 3) and platyspondyly (n = 1). Two patients had radiographic evidence of medullary expansion with widening of medulla and marked thinning of cortex in the tubular bones. Osteoporosis, as indicated by thinning of metacarpal cortex, was noted in 17 patients (8 with and 9 without desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia). Conclusions. With provision of the modern regime of regular transfusion and desferrioxamine chelation, desferrioxamine-induced bone dysplasia was a much more frequently detected radiographic abnormality in β-thalassaemia major than radiographic features owing to medullary expansion. Osteoporosis, as indicated by thinned metacarpal cortices, remained a frequent feature irrespective of the status of the skeletal dysplasia.

0037447153	Redefining the magnetic resonance imaging reference level for the cerebellar tonsil: A study of 170 adolescents with normal versus idiopathic scoliosis	Study Design. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to compare quantitatively the position of the cerebellar tonsil in neurologically normal adolescents with that in idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients and age-matched healthy controls. Objectives. To redefine the normal reference level of the cerebellar tonsil in healthy adolescents and to compare the differences in tonsillar level with AIS of different severities. Summary of Background Data. Asymptomatic Chiari I malformation has been reported not infrequently in children and adolescents with AIS. The definition of tonsillar herniation and its variations with sex, age, and curve severities have not been clarified. Methods. Sagittal MRI of hindbrain was performed on 170 adolescents, including 117 patients with AIS and 53 age-matched healthy controls. Results. The cerebellar tonsillar tip in healthy patients was found at an average of 2.8 mm above the basionopisthion reference line (BO line) (range, 0-10.5 mm), in contrast to the finding that 17.9% of the AIS patients had tonsillar tip below the BO line. The position of tonsil in the AIS group was lower than that in the healthy controls (P< 0.05), and the differences also increased with the severity of the curve (P = 0.027). Conclusions. Using the current MRI reference standards, the incidence of tonsillar herniation could be significantly underestimated. According to our experience, any inferior displacement of a tonsil below the BO line in adolescents should be regarded as abnormal. Scoliosis could be an important manifestation of subclinical tonsillar herniation.

0038632270	Cutaneous stimulation improves function of a chronic patient with cerebellar damage	The prognosis of cerebellar hemorrhage with brain stem compression is known to be poor, and patients who can usually survive are severely disabled with limited benefit from conventional rehabilitation. An innovative cutaneous stimulation was administered to a chronic patient (2 years after the incidence) who has severe ataxia, gait imbalance and limb spasticity caused by cerebellar hemorrhage. After 8 months of intervention, patient's function as evaluated by two functional measures has improved by 40%. In addition, the patient's ataxia and hypotonia have improved significantly in which he has regained the abilities to grasp objects, sit upright, control his equilibrium, and monitor an electric wheelchair. The present case study demonstrated a significant improvement of a chronic severely disabled patient who received the intervention 2 years after the accident, suggesting that the cutaneous stimulation may be a possible effective neurologic intervention.

0037987928	Paraffinoma in anterior abdominal wall mimicking liposarcoma	Paraffinoma of breast is a recognized complication of paraffin injection for breast augmentation. Liquid paraffin can extend along fascial planes to involve adjacent tissues. A rare case of paraffinoma in anterior abdominal wall, which was misdiagnosed as a soft tissue liposarcoma before surgical excision, is reported. It was heterogeneous with marked posterior acoustic shadowing and small peripheral cysts on ultrasound. On MRI, it had ill-defined margins and was heterogeneous in signal intensity. Small round components which were hypointense on all sequences were demonstrated. There is significant overlapping of imaging features between paraffinoma and soft tissue liposarcoma. Histological differentiation from well-differentiated liposarcoma may also be difficult. A detailed clinical history of previous paraffin injection for breast augmentation is very important for correct interpretation of imaging and histopathological findings.

Previous studies have suggested that disproportionate growth of the anterior and posterior columns may contribute to the development of AIS. Whole spine MRI was undertaken on 83 girls with AIS between the age of 12 and 14 years, and Cobb's angles of between 20° and 90°, and 22 age-matched controls. Multiple measurements of each thoracic vertebra were obtained from the best sagittal and axial MRI cuts. Compared with the controls, the scoliotic spines had longer vertebral bodies between T1 and T12 in the anterior column and shorter pedicles with a larger interpedicular distance in the posterior column. The differential growth between the anterior and the posterior elements of each thoracic vertebra in the patients with AIS was significantly different from that in the controls (p < 0.01). There was also a significant positive correlation between the scoliosis severity score and the ratio of differential growth between the anterior and posterior columns for each thoracic vertebra (p < 0.01). Compared with age-matched controls, the longitudinal growth of the vertebral bodies in patients with AIS is disproportionate and faster and mainly occurs by endochondral ossification. In contrast, the circumferential growth by membranous ossification is slower in both the vertebral bodies and pedicles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three children (10 boys, mean age of 6. 3 years; 13 girls, mean age of 6.6 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were examined prospectively with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR spectroscopy at 0, 8, and 20 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 years after diagnosis. White matter changes were diagnosed on the basis of hyperintense abnormalities on T2-weighted cMR images. Single-voxel hydrogen 1 MR spectroscopy results from the right frontoparietal region of 21 children who received intravenous high-dose methotrexate were analyzed for cerebral metabolite changes. Multilevel models were used to assess the change in metabolites from baseline levels at subsequent follow-up. RESULTS: At 20 weeks, MR spectroscopy showed a significant reduction (P < .05) of mean N-acetylaspartate to choline ratio and increase in mean choline to creatine ratio (P < .05) in the children given high-dose methotrexate. This decline in N-acetylaspartate to choline ratio subsequently reversed and increased, possibly because of normal age-related brain maturation. Seventeen of 21 (81%) children showed metabolite changes at MR spectroscopy, while five of 22 (23%) showed white matter changes at MR imaging at 20 weeks. One more child developed white matter changes at 32 weeks. The associated changes resolved or reduced with time. CONCLUSION: MR spectroscopy demonstrated metabolite changes in the brain after high-dose methotrexate treatment in the absence of structural white matter abnormalities at MR imaging. MR spectroscopy might thus be a more sensitive method of monitoring the effects of high-dose methotrexate in the brain. © RSNA, 2003.

10544224702	Magnetic resonance cholangiography can replace endoscopic retrograde cholangiography for the diagnosis of common bile duct stones	For patients with suspected choledocholithiasis, endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) is a standard imaging modality. Recently, magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRC) is proposed as an alternative non-invasive diagnostic method. We aim to evaluate the accuracy of MRC compared to ERC in patients with suspected choledocholithiasis in a prospective manner. Method: Patients with suspected choledocholithiasis were recruited. Non-contrast, non-breath hold, fat suppressed, respiratory-triggered, heavily T2-weighted turbo spin-echo sequence MRC were performed in these patients prior to ERC. The results of MRC were compared with ERC. The presence of ductal dilatation and stones were then assessed by blinded observers. Results: Forty-eight patients (28 male, 20 female; age:mean=64, range=32 to 86) successfully underwent MRC evaluation with diagnostic images. Two cases were excluded from analysis because of failed ERC (1 previous Polya gastrectomy; 1 suboptimal cholangiogram). In the remaining 46 patients, there is a complete match of ductal dilatation (30 dialed, 16 normal) between MRC and ERC. Concerning ductal stones, MRC correctly identified 20/21 of the positive cases (sensitivity=95%) and 21/25 negative cases (specificity=84%). Conclusion: Non-contrast, non-breath holding 3 dimenional MRC has a high sensitivity and specificity in evaluation of choledocholithiasis and can therefore replace diagnostic ERC.

Structural abnormalities associated with refractory epilepsy in 100 consecutive patients were mesial temporal sclerosis (30%), neocortical sclerosis (23%), vascular malformation (7%), neuronal migration disorders (7%), and tumours (5%). Normal brain scans were found for 28% of patients. Fourteen of 30 (46%) patients with medial temporal lobe lesions at magnetic resonance imaging were suitable candidates for surgery compared with 8/42 (19%) patients with extrahippocampal lesions (odds ratio=3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-10.6; P<0.012). Conclusion. Mesial temporal sclerosis was the most common pathology in patients with refractory epilepsy. At the Prince of Wales Hospital, for patients who have undergone a basic magnetic resonance imaging protocol and surface electroencephalography, the result of cranial magnetic resonance imaging is an important determinant for whether patients will undergo surgery.

12344323587	Liver volume in thalassaemia major: Relationship with body weight, serum ferritin, and liver function	Background: It is not known whether body weight alone can adjust for the volume of liver in the calculation of the chelating dose in β-thalassaemia major patients, who frequently have iron overload and hepatitis. Objective: The hypothesis is that liver volume in children and adolescents suffering from β-thalassaemia major is affected by ferritin level and liver function. Materials and methods: Thirty-five β-thalassaemia major patients aged 7-18 years and 35 age- and sex-matched controls had liver volume measured by MRI. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and ferritin levels were obtained in the thalassaemia major patients. Results: Body weight explained 65 and 86% of the change in liver volume in β-thalassaemia major patients and age-matched control subjects, respectively. Liver volume/kilogram body weight was significantly higher (P <0.001) in thalassaemia major patients than in control subjects. There was a significant correlation between ALT level and liver volume/kilogram body weight (r =0.55, P =0.001). Patients with elevated ALT had significantly higher liver volume/kilogram body weight (mean 42.9±12 cm
