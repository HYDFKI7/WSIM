84928589334	Self-assembled adult adipose-derived stem cell spheroids combined with biomaterials promote wound healing in a rat skin repair model	Adult adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a type of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with easy availability and serve as a potential cell source for cell-based therapy. Three-dimensional MSC spheroids may be derived from the self-assembly of individual MSCs grown on certain polymer membranes. In this study, we demonstrated that the self-assembled ASC spheroids on chitosan-hyaluronan membranes expressed more cytokine genes (fibroblast growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 2) as well as migration-associated genes (chemokine [C-X-C motif] receptor type 4 and matrix metalloprotease 1) compared with ASC dispersed single cells grown on culture dish. To evaluate the in vivo effects of these spheroids, we applied ASC single cells and ASC spheroids in a designed rat skin repair model. Wounds of 15 × 15 mm were created on rat dorsal skin, where ASCs were administered and covered with hyaluronan gel/chitosan sponge to maintain a moist environment. Results showed that skin wounds treated with ASC spheroids had faster wound closure and a significantly higher ratio of angiogenesis. Tracking of fluorescently labeled ASCs showed close localization of ASC spheroids to microvessels, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis through paracrine effects. Based on the in vitro and in vivo results, the self-assembled ASC spheroids may be a promising cellular source for skin tissue engineering and wound regeneration.

84929731781	Placental stem cells for cartilage tissue engineering	Preparation of functional biocartilage substitutes in vitro for repairing cartilage-a tissue with poor self-healing capacity-is an attractive therapeutic approach with the recent advances in tissue engineering. Human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) represent a promising source of stem cells, but the application of these fetal-stage stem cells for cartilage tissue engineering, however, has only been minimally explored. Within the literature, there are diverse opinions regarding the chondrogenic differentiation capacity of PMSCs. In this chapter, we review the research findings currently in the literature to clarify the potential use of PMSCs in cartilage repair. It has been reported that PMSCs displayed limited chondrogenic differentiation capacity in traditional pellet culture or when grown on regular tissue culture polystyrene dish. Conversely, when PMSCs were incorporated into 3D scaffolds, superior neocartilage formation was observed in vitro as well as in vivo, with results superior than using bone marrow MSCs. The potential of human PMSCs as a candidate cell source for cartilage tissue engineering was further supported by several recent studies, which also confirmed the essential role of 3D scaffolds for PMSCs to promote cartilage repair.

20444479537	Biocompatibility of poly(carbonate urethane)s with various degrees of nanophase separation	Nanophase separation has been suggested to influence the biological performance of polyurethane. In a previous work (Macromol. Biosci. 2004, 4, 891), six different 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI)-based poly(carbonate urethane)s (PCUs) that exhibited various degrees of nanophase separation were synthesized and characterized. In the present work, these PCUs were used as a model system to study the effect of nanometric structures on the biocompatibility of polyurethane. Human blood platelet activation, monocyte activation, protein adsorption, and bacterial adhesion on PCU were investigated in vitro. It was found that human blood platelets as well as monocytes were less activated on the PCU surfaces with a greater degree of nanophase separation in general. This phenomenon was closely associated with the lower ratio of human fibrinogen/albumin competitively adsorbed on these surfaces. Bacterial adhesion was also inhibited in some nanophase-separated PCUs. © 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

23044520246	Dynamic viscoelasticity study of the phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)	Communication: The phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (poly(NIPAM)) solutions was characterized by a dynamic fluid rheometer. Two critical points were observed below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST; ≈31.5°C): (1) a critical point resembling sol-gel transition occurs at ≈28.5°C, not far beyond the onset of elasticity (≈28.2°C), and (2) a second critical point appears at ≈30.4°C corresponding to the reported Flory temperature (Θ). These findings suggest that intermolecular association and coil-globule transition of poly(NIPAM) occur below the LCST. The fractal dimension of association of poly(NIPAM) chains which was calculated based upon the Theological method (≈1.49) is close to that determined by static light scattering. © Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 2000.

0001325067	Viscoelastic behavior of whey protein isolates at the sol-gel transition point	The flow behavior of whey protein isolates (WPI) was studied in systems processed under different conditions. Experiments were undertaken to study effects of heating conditions (temperature/time), pH, solid content, calcium chloride, and guanidinium hydrochloride addition on the gelation of whey protein isolate solutions. The rheological data demonstrated a power-law frequency dependence of the viscoelastic functions G′(ω) and G″(ω) and a frequency-independent tan δ determined from a multifrequency scan of tan δ vs gelling time at the gel point. The power-law exponents (n) obtained from these dynamic measurements for determining the sol-gel transition point were between 0.62 and 0.69. Those values suggest a percolation mechanism for the gelation process.

0031442795	On matching compliance between canine carotid arteries and polyurethane grafts	Compliance mismatch between a host artery and an implanted graft has been suggested as a contributing factor to a small diameter graft failure. In this study, static compliance and dynamic compliance were defined and measured in vitro and in vivo for canine carotid arteries and 2 types of polyurethane grafts. Based on these compliance values, the circumferential modulus (Eθ) and longitudinal modulus (E(z)) were calculated. It was shown that grafts have constant moduli over a wide range of pressure while the moduli of carotid arteries increase significantly with increasing pressure (dynamic E(θ) from 0.20 to 1.32 MPa). Polyurethane grafts are nearly isotropic, with the modulus almost identical in each direction, while carotid arteries are anisotropic (E(θ)E(z) = 2-3). The dynamic moduli are generally higher than static values and are especially pronounced for arteries. Due to these different inherent characteristics, the compliance of a synthetic graft may match that of the host artery only in the circumferential direction and within a small pressure range. A stated limitation is therefore given for complete compliance matching. The results provide a rationale for identifying the degree of compliance match. These efforts may lead to better designed vascular grafts.

24944584202	The effect of two different bioreactors on the neocartilage formation in type II collagen modified polyester scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes	The effect of dynamic culture conditions on neocartilage formation in type II collagen modified polyester scaffolds was studied. Porcine or human articular chondrocytes were seeded in the scaffolds. The cell-scaffold constructs were cultivated statically, in a rotating-type bioreactor or in a shaker for up to 4 weeks. The cell proliferation, morphology, NO production, synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen, and mechanical properties were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the rotating-type bioreactor promoted the growth of primary porcine chondrocytes, helped to maintain their phenotype, and increased the production of extracellular matrix. The constructs also had the largest dynamic compressive modulus. In the static condition, chondrocytes occupied only the outer margin of the cell-polymer constructs. The poor mass transfer in static condition may have caused a lower pH value in the middle of the constructs and lead further to faster scaffold degradation as well as the weakest neocartilage. Constructs in the shaker produced the highest amount of NO as well as the lowest amount of cells and matrix production. Human or porcine chondrocytes of the second passage seeded in scaffolds were much less viable, with the largest amount of cells and matrix when cultured in rotating-type bioreactors. A larger seeding density was required to form neocartilage from passaged adult chondrocytes. © 2005 International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation.

2542500900	Biocompatibility of poly(ε-caprolactone)/poly(ethylene glycol) diblock copolymers with nanophase separation	In this study, we prepared diblock copolymers of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) by aluminum alkoxide catalysts. The biological responses to the spin cast surface of different PCL/PEG diblock copolymers were investigated in vitro. Our results showed that surface hydrophilicity improved with the increased PEG segments in diblock copolymers and that bacteria adhesion was inhibited by increased PEG contents. PCL-PEG 23:77 showed nanotopography on the surface. The number of adhered endothelial cells, platelets and monocytes on diblock copolymer surfaces was inhibited in PCL-PEG 77:23 and enhanced in PCL-PEG 23:77. Nevertheless, the platelet and monocyte activation on PCL-PEG 23:77 was reduced. PCL-PEG 23:77 had better cellular response as well as lower degree of platelet and monocyte activation. The current study was the first one to demonstrate that surface nanotopography could influence not only cell adhesion and growth but also platelet and monocyte activation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The possible differences in the ultrasonic effects when using biodegradable and nonbiodegradable materials as the conduits were also studied, using silicone rubber tubes as comparisons.

27644475079	The effect of high outflow permeability in asymmetric poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration	This study attempted to accelerate the peripheral nerve regeneration, using the high outflow rate of asymmetric poly(dl-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nerve conduits. Asymmetric PLGA nerve conduits of monomer ratio 85/15 were prepared by immersion-precipitation method to serve as possible materials. In this study, mandrels were immersed into a 20% (wt/wt) of PLGA/1,4-dioxane solution and precipitated in a non-solvent bath followed by freeze-drying. Different concentrations of isopropyl alcohol (95%, 40% and 20%) were used as precipitation baths where non-asymmetric (95%) and asymmetric (40% and 20%) conduits could easily form. The asymmetric nerve conduits that consisted of macrovoids on the outer layer, and interconnected micropores in the inner sublayer, possessed characters of larger outflow rate than inflow rate. The asymmetric conduits were implanted to 10 mm right sciatic nerve defects in rats. Autografts, silicone and non-asymmetric PLGA conduits were performed as the control and the contrast groups. Implanted graft specimens of all groups were harvested for histological analysis at 4 and 6 weeks following surgery. The asymmetric PLGA conduits maintained a stable supporting structure and inhibited exogenous cells invasion during entire regeneration process. Asymmetric PLGA conduits were found to have statistically greater number of regenerated axons at the midconduit and distal nerve site of implanted grafts, as compared to the silicone and non-asymmetric groups at 4 and 6 weeks. Of interest was that the results of 4 weeks in asymmetric groups were better than the non-asymmetric groups at 6 weeks in number of axons. According to the results of permeability, the asymmetric structure in the conduit wall seemed to enhance the removal of the blockage of the waste drain from the inner inflamed wound in the early stage, which may have improved the efficacy of the peripheral nerve regeneration. The asymmetric structure could be adequately employed in the future as optimal nerve conduits in peripheral nerve regeneration. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

2942625707	Biocompatibility and biodegradation of a bone composite containing tricalcium phosphate and genipin crosslinked gelatin	A biodegradable composite (GGT) containing tricalcium phosphate ceramic particles and genipin crosslinked gelatin was developed for use as a bone substitute. The objective of this study was to assess the biocompatibility and the osteoconductivity of the GGT composite on new bone formation in vitro. Additionally, biodegradation and biocompatibility of the GGT composite in animals were investigated. Results of the GGT composites cocultured with osteoblasts showed that the concentration of genipin used as a crosslinking agent should be <0.5 wt % to avoid cytotoxicity. For in vivo degradation studies, we found that when the concentration of genipin in the composite <0.5 wt % was not enough to fully crosslink the gelatin, it results in a rapid degradation of the gelatin-genipin mixture. However, we also found that the foreign body capsule surrounding the GGT composite containing 1.0 wt % of the genipin was much thicker than that in the other three groups, that is, the composites containing 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 wt % of the genipin. We therefore concluded that the ideal concentration of genipin used in the GGT was 0.5 wt %. Finally, we examined the organ culture units, which were maintained in cultured medium for 5 weeks. Morphology of tissue was observed and the quantitative evaluation of the regenerated bone was determined. We found that the GGT composites containing 0.5 wt % of the genipin had an excellent biocompatibility and could produce osteoconduction for the regenerating bone tissues. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

29544453149	Oriented Schwann cell growth on microgrooved surfaces	Silicon wafers bearing microgrooved surfaces with various groove width, spacing, and depth were fabricated using microlithography. The orientation of rat Schwann cells along the direction of the grooves was measured at 24 h after seeding the cells. When the width/spacing of the grooves was fixed at 10/10 μm, the mean percentage of aligned cells was 12% for grooves of 0.5 μm depth, 15% for those of 1 μm depth, and 26% for those of 1.5 μm depth (P < 0.05). When the depth of grooves was fixed at 1.5 μm, the mean percentage of aligned cells increased from 26% for width/spacing 10/10 μm, to 33% for 10/20 μm or 20/10 μm, and up to 41% for 20/20 μm (P < 0.05). On the surface with grooves of width/spacing/depth = 20/20/1.5 μm and modified by laminin, the alignment at 24 h approached 60%, versus 51% for collagen-coated surface and 41% for uncoated surface (P < 0.05). At 48 h after seeding, about 66% of the cells were aligned on the above laminin-modified surface. The groove depth influenced orientation of Schwann cells significantly. The cell alignment on 20/20/3 μm microgrooved poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) 90:10 (PLGA) surfaces transferred from silicon reached 72% at 48 h and 92% at 72 h (P < 0.05). Coating this surface with laminin enhanced cell alignment only in short term (67% vs. 62% at 24 h, P < 0.05). The cell alignment guided by surface microgrooves was time dependent. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30344464715	Bio-MEMS fabricated artificial capillaries for tissue engineering	In this report, we focus on the microfabrication and cell seeding issues of artificial blood capillaries for tissue engineering. Two different fabrication methods (stainless steel electroforming and silicon electroforming) and a number of materials (PC, Polycarbonate and biocompatible material PLGA, poly lactide-co-glycolides) are implemented to build the vascular network. The vascular network is then used as the scaffold to cultivate the bovine endothelial cell (BEC). During the period of cell cultivation, oxygen and nutrient need to be continuously delivered by a circular pressurizing system. In cell culture, encouraging results are obtained through the dynamical seeding of the BEC on the scaffolds. A systematic cell culture process has been developed after repeated experiments. Successful seeding efficiencies are obtained by using the developed systematic cell culture process.

30344466970	Ultrasound preexposure improves endothelial cell binding and retention on biomaterial surfaces	In spite of the extensive studies regarding the effects of ultrasound on biological systems, the influence of low-intensity ultrasound on endothelial cells has rarely been investigated. In this work, the effect of ultrasound in improving the binding between endothelial cells and biomaterial substrates was evaluated. Based on the results, low-intensity ultrasound could change the morphology and matrix secretion of endothelial cells, and such effects persisted when preexposed cells were seeded to another substrate. The cells preexposed to ultrasound were spread further on the substrate. The actin stress fibers of ultrasound-preexposed cells on RGD-modified surfaces were especially intense and well oriented. Ultrasound could probably activate cellular integrins and subsequently allow RGD to bind them. A much firmer adhesion of ultrasound-preexposed endothelial cells to the biomaterial surface coated with the RGD-containing protein was demonstrated. Finally, polyurethane small-diameter vascular grafts seeded with ultrasound-preexposed endothelial cells showed enhanced cell retention on graft surfaces upon flushing. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We demonstrate that these polymers exhibited various degree of micro-phase separation that further influenced their surface protein adsorption, platelet activation as well as cellular attachment and growth. Polyurethanes based on poly(hexyl, ethyl)carbonate diol with MW 2017 in a molar ratio MDI/macrodiol/chain extender of either 3/2/1 or 4/3/1 resulted in greater micro-phase separation as well as superior biocompatibility and biostability. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

33845506225	Biocompatibility of poly(ether)urethane-gold nanocomposites	We have prepared the nanocomposites of a polyether-type waterborne polyurethane (PU) incorporated with different amounts (17.4-174 ppm) of gold (Au) nanoparticles (∼5 nm). The nanocomposite containing a certain amount (43.5 ppm) of gold was previously demonstrated to possess the optimal thermal and mechanical properties, as well as much reduced foreign body reactions in subcutaneous rats. In this study, the surface morphology, biocompatibility, oxidative degradation, and free radical scavenging ability of the nanocomposites were characterized in vitro. The nanocomposite at 43.5 ppm of gold ("PU-Au 43.5 ppm") exhibited different surface morphology confirmed by the atomic force microscope. PU-Au 43.5 ppm also showed enhanced cellular proliferation, reduced platelet and monocyte activation, and much less bacterial adhesion, relative to PU alone or nanocomposites at the other Au contents, in general. This better biocompatibility was associated with the surface morphological change in the presence of Au. The oxidative degradation in PU-Au 43.5 ppm was also inhibited. The increased oxidative stability corresponded to the greater free radical scavenging ability of the nanocomposites. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this study, we constructed three aECM proteins containing both heparin-binding and RGD-containing domains (387RGDS, Tri-FN10, and TNC-FN3) produced in Escherichia coli. Promotion of MG-63 cell attachment and growth in two-dimensional (2D) cultures (tissue culture plate, polycaprolactone membrane) and 3D cultures (Cytodex 1 and Plastic Plus microcarriers) were demonstrated on these three aECM protein-coated surfaces. These three aECM proteins improved MG-63 cell attachment and growth in the order TNC-FN3 > Tri-FN10 > 387RGDS in both 2D and 3D cultures. This study is the first report of the construction of aECM proteins that contain both heparin-binding and RGD-containing domains used in osteoblast tissue engineering applications. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

33751113262	Endothelial cell attachment to the gamma irradiated small diameter polyurethane vascular grafts	Previously we have fabricated the small diameter polyurethane (Pellethane 2363-80A, abbreviated PU) vascular grafts that were modified by epoxy-crosslinked gelatin (abbreviated gelatin) and an RGD-containing protein (abbreviated CBD-RGD) to facilitate the endothelial cell (EC) seeding on the surface. In this study, the biocompatibility of such surface after freeze-drying and gamma irradiation was evaluated. The contact angle of the irradiated PU dropped a little and the ESCA spectra revealed oxygen bonding. The increases in the amount of extractables as well as in the molecular weight distribution were observed. The mechanical properties decreased only slightly. The irradiated PU surface showed enhanced EC affinity that persisted after several months of storage. Gelatin, CBD-RGD (used with either gelatin or PU), and PU modified by gelatin and CBD-RGD all demonstrated higher EC affinity after freeze-drying and gamma irradiation (2.5 Mrad). The positive cellular effect remained after storage. Based on these results, freeze-drying followed by gamma irradiation at 2.5 Mrad is a proper way to process and store these vascular grafts. © 2006 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

33847309067	Transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells for peripheral nerve repair	Cell transplantation using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to alleviate neurological deficits has recently become the focus of research in regenerative medicine. Evidence suggests that secretion of various growth-promoting substances likely plays an important role in functional recovery against neurological diseases. In an attempt to identify a possible mechanism underlying the regenerative potential of BMSCs, this study investigated the production and possible contribution of neurotrophic factors by transected sciatic nerve defect in a rat model with a 15 mm gap. Cultured BMSCs became morphologically homogeneous with fibroblast-like shape after ex vivo expansion. We provided several pieces of evidence for the beneficial effects of implanted fibroblast-like BMSCs on sciatic nerve regeneration. When compared to silicone tube control animals, this treatment led to (i) improved walking behavior as measured by footprint analysis, (ii) reduced loss of gastrocnemius muscle weight and EMG magnitude, and (iii) greater number of regenerating axons within the tube. Cultured fibroblast-like BMSCs constitutively expressed trophic factors and supporting substances, including nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. The progression of the regenerative process after BMSC implantation was accompanied by elevated expression of neurotrophic factors at both early and later phases. These results taken together, in addition to documented Schwann cell-like differentiation, provide evidence indicating the strong association of neurotrophic factor production and the regenerative potential of implanted BMSCs. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

33846971987	Evaluation of the growth of chondrocytes and osteoblasts seeded into precision scaffolds fabricated by fused deposition manufacturing	In this study, fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) was utilized to fabricate the precision scaffolds for cartilage and bone regeneration. Cell seeding into such scaffolds was evaluated. For poly(D,l-lactide) (PLA) scaffolds used for cartilage regeneration, the structure with larger inner space, four direction stacking (4D) and small interval of fibers were better. Chondrocyte proliferated well with matrix accumulation in precision scaffolds coated with type II collagen at 4 weeks of in vitro culture. The seeding efficiency of osteoblasts in most polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds used for bone regeneration could arrive 50% of original cell seeding density, and the amount of cells in scaffolds increased to double fold after 2 weeks of in vitro culture. The histological cross-section also revealed proliferation and mineralization of osteoblasts among the PCL fibers.

33947536353	Characterization and biocompatibility of a titanium dental implant with a laser irradiated and dual-acid etched surface	The biological properties of commercial pure titanium (cp-Ti) dental implants can be improved by surface treatment. In this study, the cp-Ti surfaces were prepared to enable machined surfaces (TM) to be compared to the machined, sandblasted, laser irradiated and dual-acid etched surfaces (TA). The surface elements and roughness were characterized. The biocompatibility was evaluated by cell and organ culture in vitro. The removal torque was measured in rabbit implantation. Surface characterization revealed that TA surface was more oxidized than TM surface. The TA surface had micrometric, beehive-like coarse concaves. The average roughness (2.28 μm) was larger than that typical of acid-etched surfaces. Extracts of both materials were not cytotoxic to bone cells. The morphology of cells attached on the TA surface was superior to that on the TM surface. TA promoted cell migration and repaired damaged bones more effectively in organ culture. The formation of bone-like nodules on TA disk exceeded that on TM disk. Rabbit tibia implantation also proved that TA implant had greater removal torque value. These results suggested that TA had good osteoconductivity and was a potential material for dental implantation. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

The polyurethane-chitosan (PU/CS) blends can be dissolved in the acetic acid and cast into films. The mechanical properties including tensile strength and elongation, as well as the water absorption and thermal properties of the PU/CS films were evaluated. The tensile strength increased with the increased amount of chitosan, but the elongation decreased accordingly. The chitosan in the blends promoted the water absorption. Chitosan was more thermally-stable than PU, as shown in the thermal gravity analysis. Chitosan also had higher crystallinity, as demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry. The blends were partial compatible mixtures, based on the data obtained from a dynamic mechanical analysis. Biocompatibility test was conducted utilizing immortalized rat chondrocytes (IRC). After IRC were seeded onto the PU/CS films for 1.5 and 120 h, the number of cells was counted and the morphology of cells was observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Blends containing 30% chitosan had more cells attached initially. However, the blends containing more than 70% chitosan appeared to promote the cell proliferation. IRC were round on PU/CS films with more PU, but spread when the chitosan content in blends was higher. Overall, PU/CS films with more chitosan had better mechanical properties as well as biocompatibility. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34248172299	Cell migration on nanophase-separated poly(carbonate urethane)s	Nanophase separation has been suggested to influence the biological performance of polyurethanes. Several 4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate-based poly(carbonate urethane)s (PCU) that exhibited various degrees of nanophase separation have been synthesized in our previous work, and the promoting effect of nanophase separation on cell adhesion and proliferation has been demonstrated. Among these PCU, two with the most distinct nanophase separation were selected in this work for cell migration studies using a wound-healing model. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were found to migrate much faster and exhibit more intense actin stress fibers in their central region when cultured on the PCU with a greater degree of nanophase separation. These cellular events appeared to be associated with a higher level of endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression in the cells cultured on the more nanophase-separated material.

34248214639	The properties of gelatin-poly (γ-glutamic acid) hydrogels as biological glues	The influence of the molecular weight and the type of gelatin (A or B), as well as the molecular weight of poly (γ-glutamic acid) (γ-PGA), on the properties of gelatin/γ-PGA mixed bioadhesives were studied. The gelation of the system was enhanced by a crosslinker, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)- 3-(ethylcarbodiimide) hydrochloride (EDC). The gelation time of the bioadhesives was analyzed using rheological measurements. The results indicated that the type of gelatin was a critical factor in determining the gelation time of the biological glues. The mixed glues had greater bonding strength and smaller gelation times as the molecular weight of γ-PGA or gelatin increased. The swelling ratio decreased and the denaturation temperature increased upon raising the EDC concentration, indicating a greater degree of crosslinking at higher EDC concentrations. The mixed glues crosslinked with various concentrations of EDC (1.7-2.5%) showed no cytotoxicity to fibroblasts. In addition, no significant inflammatory response was observed in the rat subcutaneous implantation. The bioadhesives based on gelatin/γ-PGA remained at the site for 7 days while the fibrin glue had almost completely degraded. By choosing the appropriate gelatin type and higher molecular weight γ-PGA in the mixtures, the gelatin/γ-PGA biological glues could serve as soft tissue adhesives. Rheological characterization was essential in the evaluation of biological glues. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

The aligned Schwann cells could direct the axonal outgrowth during nerve reconstruction. One way of aligning Schwann cells is to use surface grooves in micrometric dimensions. In this study, microgrooves on chitosan or poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) were fabricated and the behaviors of Schwann cells and glial cell line C6 on these surfaces were examined. It was found that Schwann cells and C6 cells could be successfully aligned by the microgrooves, and express the genes related to the production of neurotrophic factors. The polymer conduits with microgrooves on the inner surface were implanted in rats to repair the damaged sciatic nerve. The microgrooved conduits were demonstrated to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration as compared to the smooth conduits. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

34548299705	Microvessel scaffold with circular microchannels by photoresist melting	In this research, a new process that integrates the photoresist melting and soft lithography techniques to fabricate microvessel scaffolds with circular microchannels is proposed. The commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics (formerly known as FEMLAB) is the sought after procedure to optimize the structure of the microvessel scaffold. The photolithographic technique is applied to fabricate the negative photoresist THB-120N (JSR Inc.) based microstructure that is followed by melting to the final replica mold with its structure having convex semicircle cross-section. The replica mold is hence used to replicate PDMS to the top and bottom plates of a microvessel scaffold. These two half plates are bonded after having surface treatment by inductive coupled plasma (ICP) to form the complete scaffold with circular microchannels. Finally, the bovine endothelial cells (BEC) are cultured into the scaffold. Encouraging results by semi-dynamic seeding have been observed in this context, depicting the survival of the cells in the scaffold for up to 4 weeks. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

34648827185	Effects of unidirectional permeability in asymmetric poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) conduits on peripheral nerve regeneration: An in vitro and in vivo study	The high outflow permeability of the nerve conduit used to emit the drained waste generated from the traumatized host nerve stump is critical in peripheral nerve regeneration. Our earlier studies have established that asymmetric conduits fulfill the basic requirements for use as nerve guide conduits. In this study, the inflow characteristics of optimal nerve conduits were further examined using in vivo and in vitro trials. Various asymmetric poly(DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) conduits were controlled by modifying precipitation baths using 0, 20, and 95% isopropyl alcohol, with high-porosity (permeability), medium-porosity (high outflow and low inflow), and low-porosity (permeability), respectively. In the in vitro trial, the Schwann cells and fibroblasts were seeded on either side of the asymmetric PLGA films in a newly designed coculture system that simulated the repaired nerve conduit environment. The results of the directional permeable films indicated the statistically significant proliferation of Schwann cells and the inhibition of the division of fibroblasts in lactate dehydrogenase release and inhibition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction, compared with the other films. In the in vivo trial, the PLGA conduits seeded with Schwann cells were implanted into 10 mm right sciatic nerve defects in rats. After 6 weeks, implanted conduits were harvested. Histological examination verified that directional permeable conduits had markedly more A-type and B-type myelin fibers in the midconduit and distal nerve. In this work, the directional transport characteristics were established as an extremely important factor to the design and development of optimal nerve guide conduits in peripheral nerve regeneration. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

34748896791	Fabrication of PLGA microvessel scaffolds with circular microchannels using soft lithography	A simple micromolding method for fabricating PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) microstructures made up of microchannels with a circular cross-section is presented. The thermal reflow technique is adopted to fabricate the semi-cylindrical photoresist master. The PLGA solution is prepared by dissolving PLGA polymer in acetone and then casting the solution onto the semi-cylindrical photoresist master to produce PLGA microstructures. Two PLGA membranes are bonded together to form microstructures consisting of circular microchannels. A microvessel scaffold suitable for tissue engineering was fabricated using the proposed method, and bovine endothelial cells were cultured into the scaffold by semi-dynamic seeding. The cell stain Calcein-AM was used to overcome the problem of the PLGA scaffolds becoming opaque, which in the past had made it difficult to effectively monitor the progress of cell seeding. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

36448959775	The response of articular chondrocytes to type II collagen-Au nanocomposites	The nanocomposites (denoted "CII-Au") of porcine type II collagen (CII) with 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2.5% (wt/wt) Au nanoparticles (∼5 nm) were fabricated for potential use in cartilage tissue engineering. Au formed clusters on the surface of all nanocomposites and appeared to distribute along the collagen fibrils inside the matrix. The addition of Au at low concentrations (≤0.5%) increased the modulus and viscosity, as well as the free radical-scavenging ability. These effects decreased at higher concentrations of Au. The chondrocytes on CII-Au became spindle-like with lamellipodia formation. Cell proliferation on CII-Au 0.1% was promoted. Nitric oxide (NO) in the culture medium was reduced by CII-Au 0.05% and CII-Au 0.1%. Type I collagen, aggrecan, and Sox 9 gene expressions increased with an increased Au content, but slightly decreased at 2.5% Au. There was no significant difference in the CII gene expression. The cellular uptake of Au was observed but less than that which occurred when 10 ppm of Au was added in culture medium. Chondrocytes cultured with ≤10 ppm of Au nanoparticles showed neither cytotoxicity nor change in gene expression. Au at an appropriate amount could be well dispersed in CII, and enhanced the material modulus, antioxidant effect, as well as the chondrocyte growth and matrix production. © 2007, Copyright the Authors.

3543081666	Chitosan as scaffold materials: Effects of molecular weight and degree of deacetylation	In this study, we investigated in vitro the role of the degree of deacetylation and molecular weight on some biological properties of chitosan films. The influence of different degree of deacetylation and molecular weight of chitosan on the hydrophilicity, degradation, mechanical properties and biocompatibility were evaluated. The results showed that the degree of deacetylation affected the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of the chitosan films. The molecular weight, on the other hand, affected the rate of degradation and the mechanical properties. Chitosan with higher degree of deacetylation and molecular weight was more suitable for tissue engineering applications. Alginate could be added into chitosan to modify the rigidity and hydrophilicity of chitosan. Higher hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and elongation were found after modification.

The surface morphology, biocompatibility, bacterial adhesion and free radical scavenging ability of the nanocomposites were investigated. PU-Ag nanocomposites had a different surface morphology from PU, especially at 30.2 ppm of silver. The latter nanocomposite showed enhanced cellular proliferation and reduced monocyte activation, compared with the original PU or nanocomposites with other Ag content. The nanocomposite also exhibited very low bacterial adhesion. The data obtained from a Ag

37249088840	The use of peptide-delivery to protect human adipose-derived adult stem cells from damage caused by the internalization of quantum dots	Label of human bone mesenchymal stem cells with CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) had been demonstrated to impair cell functions and activities. In the present study, QDs delivered by two different routes, Pep-1-labeled QDs (LQ) and PolyFect transfected QDs (TQ), were utilized to assess the effects of delivery mechanisms on various cellular responses of the QDs-internalized human adipose-derived adult stem cells (hADAS). Examination of labeled cells by flow cytometry and laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that LQ had higher fluorescence intensity due to the cluster formation and their distribution in cytoplasma while TQ were preferentially accumulated at peri-nuclear regions. The fluorescence intensity of the LQ group was still higher than that of the TQ group at 28 days after labeling, though cellular LQ were partitioned after initial cell division. Pep-1 but not PolyFect delivery facilitated QDs to escape from lysosome degradation. Pep-1 delivery of QDs rescued the cells from the negative effects caused by the internalized QDs on cell proliferation and on the expressions of CD29 and CD105 as well as osteogenic and chondrogenic-associated lineage markers. The same effect was also observed in the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition and secretion of chondrogenic matrices (GAG and collagen type II) in micromass culture. These indicated that Pep-1-delivered QDs may serve appropriately to track the hADAS employed in cell therapy/tissue engineering applications. The results also suggested that the endo-/lysosome degradation of QDs may depend on different surface coatings and critically influence the differentiation of hADAS. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

0032663836	Enhanced biostability by using butenediol as chain extenders in the synthesis of poly(ether)urethanes	2-Butene-1,4-diol was used as the chain extender in poly(ether)urethane (PEU) synthesis. The carbon-carbon double bonds introduced are presumed to serve as scavengers for free radicals that are generally believed to cause oxidative biodegradation. Two categories of PEU, one chain extended with 1,4-butanediol and the other chain extended with 2-butene-1,4-diol, were synthesized by a general two-stage polymerization method. Biostability was tested in an in vitro accelerated environment. The degradative effect was examined by optical microscopy combined with a self-designed image analysis program, as well as by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. Blood compatibility was evaluated by a platelet adhesion index (RIPA). It was found that PEU using 2-butene-1,4-diol as chain extender showed less surface degradation in the biostability test. Platelet adhesion was similar for all PEU. Results indicated that using butenediol in PEU synthesis could enhance the biostability of the product without impairing its blood compatibility.

0032701978	Polyurethane blended with polylactides for improved cell adhesion and reduced platelet activation	Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) or 50:50 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was blended with a commercial polyurethane (PU), Pellethane 2103-80A, using a mutual solvent technique. After preparation by salt casting, the mechanical properties of the porous matrices were measured, and the surface element was characterized by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. The attachment and growth of fibroblasts as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cells on the substrates were investigated by the cell culture test. Platelet activation on different substrates was also studied. It was found that blending with these biodegradable polymers, especially PLGA, enhanced the cellular attachment and growth. This enhancement may be correlated with the higher oxygen/carbon (O/C) atomic ratio on the surface of the blends. Blending with either PLLA or PLGA was also found to decrease platelet adhesion and activation in vitro. These characteristics make PU/polylactide blends potential substrates for cardiovascular applications.

0032981978	Rheological studies on gelling behavior of soy protein isolates	The gelling behavior of soy protein isolate (SPI) dispersions with solid contents 0.8-8.8% was studied by a dynamic fluid rheometer. Strain sweep and frequency sweep measurements showed the dispersions were stable and predominantly elastic at room temperature. Elasticity increased sharply when dispersions were heated. Cooling set was found for dispersions of higher solid contents. For solids contents < 3%, cooling set was not as pronounced; and cooling could result in reduced elasticity when the prior heating was milder. Results suggest SPI changed from an aqueous dispersion to a dispersion consisting of particles embedded in heat-soluble protein sol matrix upon heat treatment, and further underwent a transition into a gel consisting of particles embedded in heat-formed protein gel matrix. Thermoreversibility of elasticity was determined by solids content.

Gelatinization included 4 stages: suspension into sol, sol transition to gel, network destruction, and network strengthening. Increase in storage modulus (G') was observed as early as about 47 °C. For indica rice, the maximum value (G'(max)) was higher, and the decrease afterwards was slower, owing to its higher amylose content. The effects of heating time and temperature were found additive. Sealing samples with oil affected the accuracy of measurement. Finally, the network of starch gels had a larger fractal dimension than that of soy protein isolates previously investigated, suggesting firmer food texture.

0034125903	Comparative in vitro evaluation of two different preparations of small diameter polyurethane vascular grafts	Polyurethane (PU) frequently has been used to manufacture small diameter vascular grafts due to its good bicompatibility. In this study, sponge PU small diameter vascular grafts were fabricated from Pellethane 2103, as well as a self-synthesized PU, by utilization of a salt casting technique and by varying the salt/polymer ratios. Two types were made; one of them had a thin solid layer on the outer surface. The inner surface was identical and was coated with gelatin crosslinked by epoxide. Tensile properties, compliance, platelet activation, and endothelial cell attachment were evaluated in vitro. It was found that for the grafts with an outer nonporous coating, compliance could not be estimated from modulus due to anisotropy. The most compliance- matched grafts were made of self-synthesized polyurethane with a salt/polymer ratio 4 to 8 or Pellethane with a ratio 6 to 8 without the outer nonporous coating. The former had better elongation. Self-synthesized PU had lower platelet adhesion as well as more endothelial attachment than Pellethane. Porosity activated platelets strongly and reduced endothelial adhesion unless the surface was modified by the crosslinked gelatin layer. It was concluded that PU synthesized in our lab with a salt/polymer ratio of at least 4 and coated with epoxy crosslinked gelatin was a better substrate for preparation of small diameter vascular grafts.

0033901027	Susceptibility of poly(ether)urethanes to enzymatic degradation after oxidative pretreatment	Susceptibility of poly(ether)urethanes (PEU) to hydrolytic degradation by enzymes after a limited exposure to free radicals was investigated. Two PEU, one chain extended with 1,4-butanediol and the other chain extended with 2-butene-1,4-diol, were used as model polymers. Each material was subjected to treatments including oxidative, enzymatic (with papain), and oxidative followed by enzymatic treatment. The degradative effect on surfaces was examined by optical microscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy as well as XPS. It was found that enzymatic degradation occurred only after certain amount of oxidative change had been initiated. This was probably associated with enzyme adsorption on surfaces pre-exposed to oxidation. The extent of overall degradation was strongly influenced by the oxidation stability of the materials. PEU chain extended with 2-butene-1,4-diol was more resistant to oxidation, and hence less susceptible to enzymatic degradation. It was concluded that exposure of PEU to oxidative pretreatment increased its susceptibility to hydrolysis by enzymes, and that oxidation followed by enzymatic attack could be the biodegradation mechanism of PEU in vivo.

38849148305	Gold nanoparticles induce surface morphological transformation in polyurethane and affect the cellular response	Nanocomposites from a hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI)-based polyester-type waterborne polyurethane (PU) containing different amounts (17.4-174 ppm) of gold (Au) nanoparticles (∼5 nm) were prepared. The microstructure and physiochemical properties of the nanocomposites were characterized. The cell attachment and proliferation, platelet activation, and bacterial adhesion on the nanocomposites were evaluated. Gold nanoparticles in small amounts induced significant changes in surface morphology and domain structures, from hard segment lamellae to soft segment micelles. These changes resembled the morphological transformation among different mesophases occurred in diblock copolymers. Better cellular proliferation, lower platelet activation, and reduced bacterial adhesion were demonstrated for the PU nanocomposite with 43.5 or 65 ppm of Au than the pure PU or the nanocomposite containing a different amount of Au. The different cellular response on PU-Au nanocomposites was attributed to the extensively modified surface morphology and phase separation in the presence of a small amount of Au nanoparticles. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

3843099182	Evaluation of chitosan-alginate-hyaluronate complexes modified by an RGD-containing protein as tissue-engineering scaffolds for cartilage regeneration	In this study, a series of natural biodegradable materials in the form of chitosan (C)-alginate (A)-hyaluronate (H) complexes are evaluated as tissue-engineering scaffolds. The weight ratio of C/A is 1:1 or 1:2. Sodium hyaluronate is mixed in 2%. The complexes can be cast into films or fabricated as scaffolds. Their surface can be further modified by an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing protein, a cellulose-binding domain-RGD (R). Cytocompatibility tests of the films are conducted using immortalized rat chondrocyte (IRC) as well as primary articular chondrocytes harvested from rabbits. The neocartilage formation in cell-seeded scaffolds is examined in vitro as well as in rabbits, where the scaffolds are implanted into the defect-containing joints. The results from cytocompatibility tests demonstrate that R enhances cell attachment and proliferation on C-A and C-A-H complex films. Complex C1A1HR (C:A = 1:1 with H and R) has better performance than the other formulation. Cells retain their spherical morphology on all C-A and C-A-H complexes. The in vitro evaluation of the seeded scaffolds indicates that the C1A1HR complex is the most appropriate for 3-D culture, manifested by the better cell growth as well as higher glycosaminoglycan and collagen contents. When the chondrocyte scaffolds are implanted into rabbit knee cartilage defects, partial repair is observed after 1 month in C1A1HR as well as in C1A1 (C:A = 1:1 without H and R) scaffolds. The defects are completely repaired in 6 months when C1A1HR constructs are implanted. It is concluded that C1A1HR is a potential tissue-engineering scaffold for cartilage regeneration.

39049141585	Biostability and biocompatibility of poly(ether)urethane containing gold or silver nanoparticles in a porcine model	Nanocomposites from polyether-type waterborne polyurethane (PU) incorporated with different amounts of gold nanoparticles (17.4-65 ppm) or silver nanoparticles (30.2-113 ppm) were prepared. Specifically, the nanocomposite containing 43.5 ppm of gold or 30.2 ppm of silver was previously found to possess the best thermal and mechanical properties. The enhanced biostability of the nanocomposite at the specific nanoparticle content was also observed in subcutaneous rats. The latter was probably related to the free radical scavenging ability of the nanocomposite shown in vitro. In this study, the in vivo biostability of the full series of these nanocomposites was assessed by porcine subcutaneous implantation for 19 days followed by microscopic examination and chemical characterization using attenuated total reflectance-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The nanocomposite at 43.5 ppm of gold ("PU-Au 43.5 ppm") and that at 30.2 ppm of silver ("PU-Ag 30.2 ppm") exhibited superior biostability in pigs to those at higher or lower nanoparticle contents. In particular, evidence of oxidative chain scission and crosslinking of the surface was presented by ATR-IR spectra in the explanted PU and nanocomposites other than PU-Au 43.5 ppm and PU-Ag 30.2 ppm. The extent of biodegradation and that of foreign body reactions were highly associated in these nanocomposites, both of which showing negative correlation with the free radical scavenging ability. The interdependency among antioxidation/biostability/biocompatibility of PU was demonstrated in this porcine model. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3342901986	A novel use of genipin-fixed gelatin as extracellular matrix for peripheral nerve regeneration	Application of combining herbal medicine and biomedical material science to nerve regeneration is a new approach. In this study, we describe a novel use of purified genipin, which can be extracted from Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, fixing the gelatin to be an extracellular matrix for peripheral nerve regeneration. A 10-mm gap of rat sciatic nerve was created between the proximal and distal nerve stumps, which were sutured into silicone rubber tubes filled with either the genipin-fixed gelatin or collagen gel. Silicone rubber tubes filled with saline were used as controls. Six weeks after implantation, regeneration across the nerve gaps occurred in 80 and 90% of the animals from the groups of genipin-fixed gelatin and collagen, respectively, whereas only 30% in the control group. Large numbers of myelinated axons were also seen in the genipin-fixed gelatin (5104 ± 3278) and the collagen groups (8063 ± 1807). These findings indicated that the genipin-fixed gelatin could be an acceptable extracellular matrix for nerve regeneration. © 2004 Sage Publications.

Cytocompatibility of the polymer films was tested using immortalized chondrocytes. Neocartilage formation in vitro on cell-seeded scaffolds was further examined using primary porcine chondrocytes. The inflammatory response of the scaffolds was evaluated subcutaneously in rats. A pilot animal study was conducted, in which rabbit allogeneic chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds were implanted to repair the defected rabbit knee cartilage. The results demonstrated that PLGA as well as its blends with PLLA had better cell growth than pure PLLA, and that type II collagen enhanced, but RGD inhibited cell proliferation. Scaffolds made of blended PLLA/PLGA had larger dynamic compressive modulus compared to scaffolds made of PLLA or PLGA single polymer. Chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds modified by type II collagen without RGD had the greater number of cells as well as higher glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen contents compared to scaffolds without type II collagen modification or scaffolds further modified with RDG. Type II collagen modification prevented infiltration by host tissue and capsule formation. Unmodified PLLA and PLLA/PLGA constructs demonstrated persisting inflammatory response after 6 months, while all type II collagen-modified PLLA/PLGA constructs showed complete repair and no inflammation. Partial or full repair was observed after 2 months of postimplantation in type II collagen-modified PLLA/PLGA constructs, with equal cellularity and 75-80% matrix contents of a normal rabbit articular cartilage. It was concluded that PLLA/PLGA blended scaffolds modified by type II collagen were a potential tissue engineering scaffold for cartilage regeneration. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.

58249093799	The behavior of endothelial cells on polyurethane nanocomposites and the associated signaling pathways	A series of nanocomposites from polyurethane (PU) incorporated with various low concentrations (17.4-174 ppm) of gold nanoparticles (approximately 5 nm) (denoted "PU-Au") were used as a model system to study the mechanisms that influenced endothelial cell (EC) migration on biomaterial surfaces. The migration rate of ECs on the PU-Au nanocomposites was determined by a real-time image system. It was found that ECs had the highest migration rate on the nanocomposite containing 43.5 ppm of gold ("PU-Au 43.5 ppm"). The high EC migration rate was associated with increased levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) expressed by ECs cultured on PU-Au. The inductions of both eNOS and p-Akt on PU-Au were abolished by the addition of LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor), suggesting that these cellular events may be regulated through the PI3K signaling pathway. Using a biotinylated VEGF-165 that recognizes VEGF receptors and by FACS analysis, slightly higher expression of VEGF receptors for ECs on PU-Au was also demonstrated. Phalloidin staining showed that actin appeared as a circumferential band surrounding each cell on tissue culture polystyrene, whereas on PU-Au, especially on PU-Au 43.5 ppm, the cells had their margin spread out and extend processes with stress fibers in the protruding lamellipodia. Moreover, the higher EC migration rate on PU-Au 43.5 ppm was suppressed by LY294002. The higher protein expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) on PU-Au 43.5 ppm was observed in FAK-GFP transfected ECs. It was concluded that PU-Au nanocomposites activated FAK and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in ECs, leading to proliferation and migration of ECs on these surfaces. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The PU-Ag nanocomposites exhibited good nanoparticle dispersion up to 30 ppm of nano Ag, confirmed by the transmission electron microscopy. Distinct surface morphology at different concentrations of nano Ag was shown by the atomic force microscopy. The oxidative degradation of PU-Ag was inhibited in all concentrations of nano Ag tested, especially at 30 ppm (" PU-Ag 30 ppm" ). This may be related to the free radical scavenging ability observed for the nanocomposites. PU-Ag 30 ppm showed enhanced fibroblast attachment and endothelial cell response, as well as reduced monocyte and platelet activation, relative to PU alone or nanocomposites at the other silver contents.

84867302160	Primary adipose-derived stem cells enriched by growth factor treatment improves cell adaptability toward cardiovascular differentiation in a rodent model of acute myocardial infarction	The heterogeneous cell population in primary adipose derived adult stem cells (ADAS) and difficulty in keeping their primitive properties have posed certain limitations on using these cells for cell therapy. Therefore, our objective was to generate a population of cells enriched from the adipose stromal-vascular fraction (SVF) with greater differentiation potential than ADAS and to explore the mechanism behind the repair of the injured myocardium in vivo. The distinct population of adipose stromal cells was enriched by immediate treatment of the growth factor cocktail (EGF and PDGF-BB) to the freshly isolated SVF. These cells (ADAS-GFs) had distinct cell morphology from ADAS and in average had a smaller size. They presented co-expression of CD140a (pericytic markers) and CD34 (hematopoietic marker), more obvious mesenchymal (CD13, CD29, CD44, CD90 and CD117) markers, but rare KDR, and were negative for CD45 and CD31. ADAS-GFs not only spontaneously expressed endothelial cell markers and formed capillary-like tubes on Matrigel but also clearly expressed early cardiomyocyte marker genes when embedded in methylcellulose-based medium. In Sprague- Dawley (SD) rats with left anterior descending artery (LAD)-induced myocardial infarction (MI), the ADAS-GFs transplanted group had the left ventricular function significantly improved compared with the ADAS transplanted group or the control group at 12 weeks post transplantation. The immunofluorescence staining revealed that the transplanted ADAS-GFs expressed GATA4, β-myosin heavy chain and troponin T protein but not vWF. More capillaries were also observed around the infracted zone in the ADAS-GFs transplanted group. These data suggested that ADAS-GFs with a higher proangiogenic potential may restore the cardiac function of infracted myocardium via the direct cardiomyocyte differentiation as well as angiogenesis recruitment. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

84867140065	The calcium-dependent regulation of spheroid formation and cardiomyogenic differentiation for MSCs on chitosan membranes	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were recently found to form three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids on chitosan membranes. The exact mechanism of spheroid formation, however, remains unclear. In this study, the regulation of spheroid formation for adipose derived adult stem cells (ADAS) grown on chitosan membranes was examined. By varying the membrane thickness, calcium concentration in culture medium, and acetylation extent of chitosan, the physico-chemical characteristics of chitosan that modulated spheroid formation was elucidated. The capacity of cardiomyogenic differentiation was further evaluated. Results suggested that the calcium binding capacity of chitosan may affect the cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions and critically influence the dynamics of spheroid formation. The intracellular calcium level was elevated for ADAS spheroids on chitosan. Chitosan-bound calcium was observed to enter the cells. The expression of N-cadherin was upregulated for ADAS spheroids on chitosan, evidenced by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. After the induction by 5-aza, the expression levels of cardiac marker genes (Gata4, Nkx2.5, Tnnt2, and Myh6) were remarkably enhanced (about four-fold) for ADAS on chitosan vs. tissue culture polystyrene or polyvinyl alcohol. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression of cardiac-associated tight junction protein ZO-1 for ADAS grown on chitosan membranes. The gene expression of Wnt11 was significantly upregulated for ADAS spheroids on chitosan at 3 days and 12 days. We suggested that Wnt11 may be involved in the spheroid formation and cardiomyogenic differentiation of MSCs on chitosan membranes. Spheroids formed on the acetylated chitosan or polyvinyl alcohol membranes failed to show such behavior. The properties of MSC spheroids were therefore determined by the culture substrate. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

WSC was found to be the most suitable crosslinker. Complex scaffolds made from chitosan and gelatin with a component ratio equal to one possessed the proper degradation rate and mechanical stability in vitro.

84877278644	Enhancing silver nanoparticle and antimicrobial efficacy by the exfoliated clay nanoplatelets	The antimicrobial efficacy of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) is enhanced by using the exfoliated clay nanoscale silicate platelets (NSP) as the supports. The NSP were in the dimension of 80 nm × 80 nm × 1 nm and were derived from the exfoliation of natural clays such as sodium montmorillonite. Increasing the amount of NSP addition at the relative Ag/silicate composition ratios from 0.5/99.5 to 50/50 w/w significantly altered the particle size AgNP from 3.6 nm to 35 nm in diameter. Evaluation of antibacterial activities for these nanohybrids demonstrated the effect of the amount of NSP support and Ag size on inhibiting the growth of dermal pathogens including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Scanning electron microscope observations further revealed the interaction of the AgNP/NSP nanohybrids in contact with individual bacteria surface. The tailoring of the AgNP/NSP nanostructures has largely affected the bacterial surface interaction by NSP adherence and hence the antimicrobial efficacy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.

84908102075	Acquisition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-like phenotypes within chitosan-hyaluronan membrane-derived 3D tumor spheroids	Cancer drug development has to go through rigorous testing and evaluation processes during pre-clinical invitro studies. However, the conventional two-dimensional (2D) invitro culture is often discounted by the insufficiency to present a more typical tumor microenvironment. The multicellular tumor spheroids have been a valuable model to provide more comprehensive assessment of tumor in response to therapeutic strategies. Here, we applied chitosan-hyaluronan (HA) membranes as a platform to promote three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid formation. The biological features of tumor spheroids of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells on chitosan-HA membranes were compared to those of 2D cultured cells invitro. The cells in tumor spheroids cultured on chitosan-HA membranes showed higher levels of stem-like properties and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, such as NANOG, SOX2, CD44, CD133, N-cadherin, and vimentin, than 2D cultured cells. Moreover, they exhibited enhanced invasive activities and multidrug resistance by the upregulation of MMP2, MMP9, BCRC5, BCL2, MDR1, and ABCG2 as compared with 2D cultured cells. The grafting densities of HA affected the tumor sphere size and mRNA levels of genes on the substrates. These evidences suggest that chitosan-HA membranes may offer a simple and valuable biomaterial platform for rapid generation of tumor spheroids invitro as well as for further applications in cancer stem cell research and cancer drug screening.

4544295056	Enhanced biocompatibility in biostable poly(carbonate)urethane	In this work, we synthesized two MDI-based polyurethanes, including a poly(ether)urethane (PEU) and a poly(carbonate)urethane (PCU), by using different soft segments, poly (tetramethylene oxide) and poly(hexyl, ethyl)carbonate diol (M̄ ∼ 2 000). We demonstrated that, in addition to the enhanced biostability of PCU over PEU, the biological performances of PCU in vitro were also improved in general. These included, better cellular attachment and proliferation, less platelet activation, as well as reduced monocyte activation. The unusual wide-ranging enhancement in biocompatibility for PCU was believed to be related to the larger microphase separation in PCU (∼25 nm) that caused distinct protein adsorption on the surface.

47549098489	A study on chitosan modification of polyester fabrics by atmospheric pressure plasma and its antibacterial effects	Chitosan is a natural nontoxic biopolymer used widely in various fields due to the antimicrobial activities. In this study, the properties of polyester fabrics grafted with chitosan oligomers/polymers after being activated by atmospheric pressure plasmas were evaluated. The antibacterial effect was most evident when the surface of fabrics was activated by atmospheric pressure plasma for 60 to 120 seconds and grafted with chitosan oligomers. The modified fabrics also exhibited good biocompatibility. This process can be applied to a large area and used to produce antibacterial polymer fibers.

53649087970	Biostability and biocompatibility of poly(ester urethane)-gold nanocomposites	Nanocomposites from a polyester-type water-borne polyurethane (PU) containing different amounts (17.4-174 ppm) of gold (Au) nanoparticles (∼5 nm) were prepared. A previous study has shown that the Au nanoparticles could induce surface morphological transformations in the PU (e.g. the mesophase transition from hard lamellae to soft micelles), which modify the physicochemical properties of the PU as well as the fibroblast response to the PU. The current study focused on the biostability and biocompatibility of the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and their oxidative stability and free radical scavenging ability were tested. The inflammatory response was evaluated by monocyte activation in vitro and rat subcutaneous implantation in vivo. It was found that the nanocomposites containing 43.5-65 ppm of Au had the least monocyte activation and tissue reactions. PU and the nanocomposites were rather resistant to oxidative degradation in vitro and biodegradation in vivo. The nanocomposites exhibited greater free radical scavenging abilities than the original PU. Based on the above results, the significantly enhanced biocompatibility of the PU-Au nanocomposites with 43.5-65 ppm of gold over the original PU appeared to be a result of the extensively modified surface morphology and greater free radical scavenging ability, instead of due to the difference in biostability. © 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.

55849092119	Synthesis of a new photoreactive gelatin with BTDA and HEMA derivatives	A novel bio-affinitive, photocuring, and membrane-forming gelatin derivative was synthesized in this study. This process was based on the amide formation between carboxylic acid and the amine in methanol-water media using dicydohexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) as a condenser. Gelatin and glycine were the sources of amine in the model reaction. Since there were two anhydride groups in each 3,3′, 4,4′-benzophenone tetra-carboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) molecule, two 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) molecules were used to induce the ring-opening reaction of BTDA and release two carboxylic acid groups. The resulting photoreactive gelatin was called GEBTHE, of which the photoreactive component was the ketone groups of BTDA and HEMA that played the role of double bond supplier. This photoreactive gelatin could be converted from the transparent liquid phase into swollen membrane by a 6-min irradiation of high pressure mercury lamp. The most efficient irradiation was at 267 nm and the highest degree of swelling of the cured GE-BTHE membrane could reach 5.9. The elongation from the dried gel remained 5-10%, i.e., relatively elastic. The properties of this gelatin derivative were investigated using amide formation analysis, calculation of the gel content and the swelling ratio, and monitoring of the photocuring process. The GE-BTHE synthesized in this study should be very potential in applications such as protective wound dressings and hemostatic absorbents for minimally invasive surgery. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

56949091377	Sciatic nerve repair by microgrooved nerve conduits made of chitosan-gold nanocomposites	Background: To better direct the repair of peripheral nerve after injury, an implant consisting of a multicomponent micropatterned conduit seeded with NSC was designed. Methods: The mechanical properties of the chi-Au nanocomposites were tested. In vitro, the effect of chi-Au on cell behavior (NSC and glial cell line C6) and the influence of micropattern on cell alignment were evaluated. In vivo, the micropatterned conduits with/without the preseeded NSC were implanted to bridge a 10-mm-long defect of the sciatic nerve in 9 male Sprague-Dawley rats. The repair outcome was investigated 6 weeks after the surgery. Results: Based on the dynamic modulus, chitosan with 50 ppm or more gold was a stronger material than others. In vitro, gold at 25 or 50 ppm led to better cell performance for NSC; and gold at 50 ppm gave better cell performance for C6. On the microgrooved substrate, the NSC had elongated processes oriented parallel to the grooves, whereas the NSC on the nonpatterned surfaces did not exhibit a particular bias in alignment. In vivo, the number of regenerated axons, the regenerated area, and the number of blood vessels were significantly higher in the NSC-preseeded conduit. Conclusion: Modification of the chitosan matrix by gold nanoparticles not only provides the mechanical strength but also affects the cellular response. The preliminary in vivo data demonstrated that the biodegradable micropatterned conduits preseeded with NSC provided a combination of physical and biological guidance cues for regenerating axons at the cellular level and offered a better alternative for repairing sciatic nerve transactions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

58649088036	A novel approach to align adult neural stem cells on micropatterned conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration: A feasibility study	There is a strong need for nerve-tissue engineering using the guide conduit and Schwann cells or neural stem cells (NSCs) with regeneration potential for injured peripheral nerves. In this study, micropatterned poly(d,l-lactide) (PLA) conduits were fabricated by microlithography and solvent-casting. The PLA conduits were seeded with the novel green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive adult mouse NSCs obtained using the patented method of one of the authors. About 85% of the seeded NSCs were successfully aligned on the micropatterned conduits within 72 h and expressed the genes related to the production of neurotrophic factors. Gene expressions for the neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were upregulated by the micropatterned conduits at 72 h. The micropatterned PLA conduits seeded with the aligned NSCs were used to bridge the 10-mm sciatic nerve gaps in rats and were found to facilitate nerve repair and functional recovery during a period of 6 weeks compared with the nonseeded group. This model can be used to study the role of adult NSCs in peripheral-nerve regeneration in the future. © 2009, International Center for Artificial Organs and Transplantation and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

59649115836	The regulation of the gap junction of human mesenchymal stem cells through the internalization of quantum dots	The delivery mechanism of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) into cells was previously found to critically determine the biocompatibility of QDs to human adult mesenchymal stem cells, but the associated mechanism remained unknown. The present study tried to establish a link between the above phenomenon and the change in gap junction upon QD internalization. By comparing Pep-1- and PolyFect-mediated QD internalizations, the connexin 43 (Cx43)-mediated gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) of human adipose-derived adult stem cells was investigated in monolayer and in three-dimensional (3D) culture (alginate hollow spheres). The latter system offered cells more mobility, which was more similar as in vivo. The results showed that Pep-1-coated QDs, which escaped from the endo-/lysosome degradation, could activate the F-actin assembly and the ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Cx43. The consequence was a reduction in Cx43-mediated GJIC. When the cells were grown in high density 3D alginate hollow spheres instead of in monolayer, the decrease of GJIC caused by the QD internalization was restored. These results indicated that the adaptability in QDs-mediated regulation of GJIC with different delivery coatings depended on the culture systems. The study also suggested that the regulation of gap junction may play a key role in QD cytotoxicity. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

62249088632	Fabrication of nanostructured PLGA scaffolds using anodic aluminum oxide templates	PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) is one of the most used biodegradable and biocompatible materials. Nanostructured PLGA even has great application potentials in tissue engineering. In this research, a fabrication technique for nanostructured PLGA membrane was investigated and developed. In this novel fabrication approach, an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film was use as the template; the PLGA solution was then cast on it; the vacuum air-extraction process was applied to transfer the nano porous pattern from the AAO membrane to the PLGA membrane and form nanostures on it. The cell culture experiments of the bovine endothelial cells demonstrated that the nanostructured PLGA membrane can double the cell growing rate. Compared to the conventional chemical-etching process, the physical fabrication method proposed in this research not only is simpler but also does not alter the characteristics of the PLGA. The nanostructure of the PLGA membrane can be well controlled by the AAO temperate. ©EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008.

In this study, the properties of nylon textiles grafted with chitosan oligomer or chitosan polymer after being activated by open air plasma were evaluated. Results showed that nylon textiles grafted with chitosan polymer had better antibacterial performances than those grafted with chitosan oligomer. Air plasma activation at a higher speed (26 m/min) for a few times facilitated the grafting of chitosan and critically determined the antibacterial activities. Further treatment with air plasma after grafting improved the antibacterial effect. Overall, chitosan-grafted nylon textiles showed good antibacterial potential as well as biocompatibility. © 2009 The Korean Fiber Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH.

66249087603	Fabrication of the microgrooved/microporous polylactide substrates as peripheral nerve conduits and in vivo evaluation	An innovative technique combining phase transition and microprinting in one step was applied to fabricate the nerve conduits used in peripheral nerve regeneration. The asymmetric microporosity served to generate asymmetric permeability, and the surface microgrooves were introduced to achieve cell alignment in vitro. The symmetric/asymmetric porous poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) substrates with microgrooves on the surface were tested for their ability to repair 10 mm sciatic nerve transection defects in rats. The in vivo results showed that porous PLA conduits maintained a stable supporting structure during the entire regeneration process. The myelin sheaths of the regenerated nerve in asymmetric conduits were thicker than in symmetric groups at 4 weeks. Moreover, the regenerated nerves in the asymmetric conduits with surface microgrooves had the highest degree of myelination at 4 weeks and the most number of vessels at 6 weeks. The walking track analysis also implied that the asymmetric conduits with surface microgrooves had the highest degree of functional recovery. Based on the study, the combination of microgrooves and asymmetric microporous structure could be employed in the design of nerve conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration in the future. © 2009 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

66249093474	Drug release from interpenetrating polymer networks based on poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate and gelatin	In order to develop new materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) based on poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate (PEGMEA) and gelatin were synthesized. These two materials were cross-linked sequentially using N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide (NMBA) and glutaraldehyde (Glu). Two series of IPNs gels were synthesized by applying different amounts of PEGMEA and gelatin in the initial feed. Sequential IPNs were prepared by polymerizing and cross-linking PEGMEA in the presence of gelatin using redox initiators (e.g., ammonium peroxydisulfate (APS) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl ethylenediamine (TEMED)), as well as NMBA as the cross-linking agent. Gelatin in firm gel was then cross-linked with 1% glutaraldehyde. The swelling kinetics, mechanical properties and drug-release behavior of these IPNs were analyzed. The surface properties were examined by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the swelling ratio decreased with an increase in the content of both PEGMEA and gelatin in the IPNs. PEGMEA/gelatin-based full-IPNs had a significantly higher shear modulus (G) and cross-linking density (ρ) when the content of PEGMEA was increased. The drug loading was very high due to the full-IPN structure. The drug-release velocity was mainly affected by the content of PEGMEA. © 2009 VSP.

67349109843	The response of endothelial cells to polymer surface composed of nanometric micelles	The response of endothelial cells (ECs) to a polyurethane (PU) characteristic of surface micelles (∼89 nm in diameter) and two novel nanocomposites (PU-Au) and (PU-Ag) containing smaller surface micelles (∼14-22 nm in diameter) was investigated. The molecular mechanism by which ECs reacted to nanometric surface micelles was examined. On PU-Au and PU-Ag, cell migration rate was promoted. This was accompanied by the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) expression. The induced eNOS and p-Akt expression was inhibited by LY294002, indicating that the effect of nanocomposites could be attributed to the PI3K pathway. An elevation of intracellular calcium concentration was noted. Additionally, more actin fibers were induced by PU-Au and PU-Ag. Reduction of actin expression upon addition of Y-27632 (an inhibitor of Rho-GTPase) and SU-1498 (an inhibitor of VEGF-R2) was observed. It was concluded that the nanometric micelles on PU surface may interact with ECs and accelerate their migration by increasing cytoplasmic Ca

66249135321	Fabrication of precision scaffolds using liquid-frozen deposition manufacturing for cartilage tissue engineering	The fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) system has been used to fabricate tissue-engineered scaffolds with highly interconnecting and controllable pore structure, although the system is limited to a few materials. For this reason, the liquid-frozen deposition manufacturing (LFDM) system based on an improvement of the FDM process was developed. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) precision scaffolds were fabricated using LFDM from PLGA solutions of different concentrations. A greater concentration of PLGA solution resulted in greater mechanical strength but also resulted in less water content and smaller pore size on the surface of the scaffolds. LFDM scaffolds in general had mechanical strength closer to that of native articular cartilage than did FDM scaffolds. Neocartilage formation was observed in LFDM scaffolds seeded with porcine articular chondrocytes after 28 days of culture. Chondrocytes in LFDM scaffolds made from low concentrations (15-20%) of PLGA solution maintained a round shape, proliferated well, and secreted abundant extracellular matrix. In contrast, the FDM PLGA scaffolds had low cell numbers and poor matrix production because of heavy swelling. The LFDM system offered a useful way to fabricate scaffolds for cartilage tissue-engineering applications. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

67349179982	Evaluation of chondrocyte growth in the highly porous scaffolds made by fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) filled with type II collagen	Highly porous poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering were fabricated in this study using the fused deposition manufacturing (FDM) process and were further modified by type II collagen. The average molecular weight of PLGA decreased to about 60% of the original value after the melt-extrusion process. Type II collagen exhibited sponge-like structure and filled the macroporous FDM scaffolds. An increase of the fiber spacing resulted in an increase of the porosity. The storage modulus of FDM scaffolds with a large fiber spacing was comparable to that of the native porcine articular cartilage. Although the FDM hybrid scaffolds were swollen in various extents after 28 days of in vitro culture, the seeded chondrocytes were well distributed in the interior of the scaffolds with a large fiber spacing and neocartilage was formed around the scaffolds. The study also suggested that a low processing temperature may be required to produce PLGA precision scaffolds using FDM. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.

67749137301	Cytotoxicity and immunological response of gold and silver nanoparticles of different sizes	The immunological response of macrophages to physically produced pure Au and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) (in three different sizes) is investigated in vitro. The treatment of either type of NP at ≥10ppm dramatically decreases the population and increases the size of the macrophages. Both NPs enter the cells but only AuNPs (especially those with smaller diamter) up-regulate the expressions of proinflammatory genes interlukin-1 (IL-1), interlukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Transmission electron microscopy images show that AuNPs and AgNPs are both trapped in vesicles in the cytoplasma, but only AuNPs are organized into a circular pattern. It is speculated that part of the negatively charged AuNPs might adsorb serum protein and enter cells via the more complicated endocytotic pathway, which results in higher cytotoxicity and immunological response of AuNPs as compared to AgNPS. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

69649097014	The promotion of chondrogenesis in adipose-derived adult stem cells by an RGD-chimeric protein in 3D alginate culture	The dynamic regulation of integrin-binding peptides is crucial for chondrogenic differentiation. Here, we revealed the feasibility for flexible modification of RGD by embedding a large molecular weight and slightly charged (isoelectric point, 6-6.25) RGD-chimeric protein (CBD-RGD) with cellulose-binding domain (CBD) in three dimensional (3D) alginate beads to evaluate the chondrogenesis of adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADAS). The binding of CBD-RGD with cells and its diffusion from alginate beads were studied on fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CBD-RGD. The increases in gene expression (Sox9, Aggrecan, fibronectin and collagen II), accumulation of chondrogenic matrices and decrease of collagen X gene expression during TGF-β3 induction were only observed for those beads containing 10 mg/g CBD-RGD initially, with 20.18 ± 0.73% of that released in a week. The contrary was observed for beads with CBD-RGD 20 mg/g initially and having higher persistence (only 8.6 ± 2.17% released in a week). The 10 mg/g CBD-RGD-mediated enhancement was demonstrated via the activation of integrin α5 and β1-dependent pathway, and especially related to the upregulation of Sox9 gene and the temporary block of fibronectin expression as well as sustained inhibition of RhoA activity in the early differentiation stage. Thus, we speculated that the dynamic mobility of CBD-RGD may account for the enhanced chondrogenesis. It was concluded that the CBD-RGD-alginate culture system promoted the chondrogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells coordinated with TGF-β3 induction in an RGD dose-dependent manner. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

68149136788	Fabrication of orderly nanostructured PLGA scaffolds using anodic aluminum oxide templates	In this research, two simple fabrication methods to fabricate orderly nanostructured PLGA scaffolds using anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template were conducted. In the vacuum air-extraction approach, the PLGA solution was cast on an AAO template first. The vacuum air-extraction process was then applied to suck the semi-congealed PLGA into the nanopores of the AAO template to form a bamboo sprouts array of PLGA. The surface roughness of the nanostructured scaffolds, ranging from 20 nm to 76 nm, can be controlled by the sucking time of the vacuum air-extraction process. In the replica molding approach, the PLGA solution was cast on the orderly scraggy barrier-layer surface of an AAO membrane to fabricate a PLGA scaffold of concave nanostructure. Cell culture experiments using the bovine endothelial cells (BEC) demonstrated that the nanostructured PLGA membrane can increase the cell growing rate, especially for the bamboo sprouts array scaffolds with smaller surface roughness. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

Three of them contained silanol terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, MW ∼2000) blocks.

74049154827	Transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells as therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases	With better understanding of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), many therapeutic approaches to cardiovascular diseases have been developed. This article will review novel research of EPCs in promoting angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and endothelialization, as a design for future clinical treatment. Cell therapy has the potential to supply stem/progenitor cells and multiple angiogenic factors to the region of ischemia. The efficacy of EPC transplantation may be impaired by low survival rate, insufficient cell number, and impaired function in aging and diseases. Combination of EPCs or cells primed with growth factors or genetic modification may improve the therapeutic efficacy. The molecular mechanism involved in EPC repairing processes is essential. Thus, we have also addressed the molecular mechanism of mobilization, homing, and differentiation of EPCs. The potential of therapeutic neovascularization, angiogenic factor therapy, and cell transplantation have been elucidated. Based on past experience and actual knowledge, future strategies for EPC therapy will be proposed in order to fully exploit the potential of EPC transplantation with clinical relevance for cardiovascular disease applications. © 2009 Cognizant Comm.

The CatWalk-assisted automated gait analysis system provides a comprehensive way to assess a number of dynamic and static gait parameters simultaneously. In this study, we used the Catwalk system to investigate changes in gait parameters in adult rats with unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions and the rescue effect of dopaminergic neuron transplantation on gait function. Four weeks after 6-OHDA injection, the intensity and maximal area of contact were significantly decreased in the affected paws and the swing speed significantly decreased in all four paws. The relative distance between the hind paws also increased, suggesting that animals with unilateral 6-OHDA-induced lesions required all four paws to compensate for loss of balance function. At 8 weeks post-transplantation, engrafted dopaminergic neurons expressed tyrosine hydroxylase. In addition, the intensity, contact area, and swing speed of the four limbs increased and the distance between the hind paws decreased. Partial recovery of methamphetamine-induced rotational response was also noted.

77951246275	Antimicrobial activities and cellular responses to natural silicate clays and derivatives modified by cationic alkylamine salts	Nanometer-scale silicate platelet (NSP) materials were previously developed by increasing the interlayer space and exfoliation of layered silicate clays such as montmorillonite and synthetic fluorinated mica by the process of polyamine exfoliation. In this study, the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of these nanometer-scale silicate clays were evaluated. The derivatives of NSP (NSP-S) which were modified by C18-fatty amine salts via ionic exchange association exhibited the highest antibacterial activity in the aqueous state among all clays. The high antibacterial activity, however, was accompanied by elevated cytotoxicity. The variations of cell surface markers (CD29 and CD44) and type I collagen expression of fibroblasts treated with the clays were measured to clarify the mechanism of the silicate-induced cytotoxicity. The signal transduction pathway involved the downregulation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which appeared to participate in silicate-induced cytotoxicity. This study helped to understand the antibacterial potential of NSP and the interaction of natural and modified clays with cellular activities. © 2009 American Chemical Society.

77955715711	The static magnetic field accelerates the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of dental pulp cells	Dental pulp cells (DPCs) can differentiate into osteoblasts and are deemed a promising cell source for bone regeneration. Static magnetic field (SMF) stimulates osteoblast differentiation but the effect in DPCs remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of SMF exposure on the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of rat DPCs in vitro. Cells were continuously exposed to SMF at 290 mT in the presence/absence of osteogenic induction [dexamethasone (Dex)/β-glycerophosphate (β-GP)]. Results showed that SMF alone did not impair the cell cycle and proliferation. On the other hand, obvious condensation in the metachromatic staining of the extracellular matrix with toluidine blue was observed for SMF-exposed cells as well as the Dex/β-GP treated cells. SMF in combination with Dex/β-GP significantly increased the mRNA expression of osteogenic genes, as well as the ALP activity and extracellular calcium concentration at the early stage, followed by obvious calcium deposits later. Besides, SMF exposure increased the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) at 3 h and accelerated the mRNA expression of osteogenic transcription factor, Cbfa1, advancing its activation time from 168 to 72 h under osteogenic induction. In summary, SMF exposure in combination of Dex/β-GP induction could significantly accelerate the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of DPCs. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.

Grafting of these components was verified by electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. The modified nerve conduits showed enhanced ability in the repair of 10-mm sciatic nerve transection defects in rats.

78049277611	The fabrication of PLGA microvessel scaffolds with nano-patterned inner walls	Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is one of the most commonly used biodegradable, biocompatiblematerials. Nanostructured PLGA has immense potential for application in tissue engineering. In this article we discuss a novel approach for the fabrication of PLGA microvessel scaffolds with nanostructured inner walls. In this novel nanopatterning approach, the thermal reflow technique is first adapted to fabricate a semi-cylindrical photoresist master mold. A thin film of titanium and a thin film of aluminum are sputtered in sequence on the semi-cylindrical microvessel network. Aluminum foil anodization is then executed to transform the aluminum thin film into a porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) film. During the casting process a PLGA solution is cast on the AAO film to build up semicylindrical PLGA microstructures with nanostructured inner walls after which inductive coupled plasma (ICP) is implemented to assist bonding of the two PLGA structures. The result is the building of a network of microchannels with nano-patterned inner walls. Bovine endothelial cells (BECs) are carefully cultured in the scaffold via semi-dynamic seeding for 7 days. Observations show that the BECs grew more separately in a nano-patterned microvessel scaffold than they did in a smooth surface scaffold. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

The seeded scaffolds were incubated in culture medium with TGF-β3 for 23 days under static or dynamic culture condition. The cell number, amount of matrix, cell morphology and cell differentiation in constructs were determined. The cell number for each scaffold was higher when TGF-β3 was added into the culture medium. Cell numbers in CG scaffolds were higher than those in BCII scaffolds. Cell proliferation increased under dynamic culture condition. Many differentiated cells as identified by anti S-100 staining were observed when TGF-β3 was employed. The difference in materials of the two scaffolds had no apparent effect on TGF-β3 induced hBMSCs transformation into differentiated cells.

To improve biocompatibility, the lumen was modified by gelatin hydrogel crosslinked with two different reagents, EDC and genipin. It was found that the choice of crosslinking agents could significantly affect human lung carcinoma cell proliferation. Genipin-crosslinked gelatin hydrogel had significantly better cell proliferation than EDC-crosslinked hydrogel. The study further investigated the performance of the PCL tube modified by genipin-crosslinked gelatin, using a rabbit tracheal implantation model with implants harvested and histologically examined. In vivo results showed that the PCL tube possessed suitable mechanical properties for resisting collapse during implantation. Additionally, PCL modified by genipin-crosslinked gelatin was found to suppress granulation tissue growth and prolong animal survival time in comparison with the original PCL tube. Genipin could be an effective treatment to reduce granulation tissue formation at the tracheal anastomoses. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed to monitor the nerve regeneration process. The extents of nerve regeneration and conduit degradation were quantified by image analysis. Functional and histological analyses were followed to assess nerve reinnervation. MR images showed that the transected nerve was connected at about 4 months. The diameter of the regenerated nerve continued to increase while the conduit was gradually degraded. The conduit was completely degraded in 18 months. The degradation kinetics in vivo was estimated based on MR images. The functional recovery after 18 months was ∼82% based on electrophysiology. The extension range of the operated limb was slowly recuperated to ∼81% at 18 months. Histology showed that nerve bundles were self-assembled after 16-18 months, but the morphologies were still different from those of normal sciatic nerve. This was the first work on the long-term evaluation of peripheral nerve regeneration in a rabbit model, and the first to report the use of MRI to obtain the real-time images of regenerated nerve in a biomaterial conduit as well as to define the degradation rate of the conduit in vivo. The platform established in this study serves to evaluate the regeneration of larger-diameter (>3-mm) nerve across a long-gap bridged by a conduit. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

79955023773	Sciatic Nerve Regeneration by Microporous Nerve Conduits Seeded With Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor or Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Gene Transfected Neural Stem Cells	Neurotrophic factors such as the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promote nerve cell survival and regeneration, but their efficacy in repairing a longer gap defect of rat sciatic nerve (15mm) has not been established. In this study, two recombinant mammalian vectors containing either rat GDNF gene or BDNF gene were constructed and each was transfected into neural stem cells (NSCs). It was found that the transfection of GDNF or BDNF gene into NSCs led to significantly enhanced expression of GDNF or BDNF mRNA. The amount of GDNF or BDNF protein secreted from the transfected NSCs showed a 3.3-fold or 2.5-fold increase than that from nontransfected NSCs, respectively. The regeneration capacity of rat sciatic nerve in a poly(D,L-lactide) conduit seeded with GDNF or BDNF-transfected NSCs was evaluated by the histology, functional gait, and electrophysiology after 8 weeks of implantation. It was observed that the degree of myelination and the size of regenerated tissue in the conduits seeded with GDNF- and BDNF-transfected NSCs were higher than those seeded with the nontransfected NSCs. Conduits seeded with GDNF-transfected NSCs had the greatest number of blood vessels. The functional recovery assessed by the functional gait and electrophysiology was significantly improved for conduits seeded with GDNF or BDNF-transfected NSCs. It was concluded that the genetically modified NSCs may have potential applications in promoting nerve regeneration and functional recovery. © 2011, © the Authors.

79954511855	Antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles in three different sizes and their nanocomposites with a new waterborne polyurethane	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are strong bactericidal agents but they are also cytotoxic. Embedding them in a polymer matrix may reduce their cytotoxic effect. In the present study, AgNPs in three average sizes were tested for their antibacterial activities and cytotoxicity. Nanocomposites from a new waterborne polyetherurethane (PEU) ionomer and AgNPs were prepared without the use of any crosslinker. It was observed that the antibacterial activity of AgNPs against Escherichia coli started at the effective concentration of 0.1-1 ppm, while that against Staphylococcus aureus started at higher concentrations of 1-10 ppm. Cytotoxicity of AgNPs was observed at the concentration of 10 ppm. AgNPs with smaller average size showed greater antibacterial activity as well as cytotoxicity. The PEU synthesized in this study showed high tensile strength, and the addition of AgNPs at all sizes further increased its thermal stability. The delicate surface features of nanophases, however, were only observed in nanocomposites with either small- or medium-sized AgNPs. PEU-Ag nanocomposites had a strong bacteriostatic effect on the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. The proliferation of endothelial cells on PEU-Ag nanocomposites was enhanced, whereas the platelet adhesion was reduced. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene was upregulated on PEU-Ag containing small-sized AgNPs (30 ppm) or medium-sized AgNPs (60 ppm). This effect was not as remarkable in nanocomposites from large-sized AgNPs. Overall, nanocomposites from the PEU and 60 ppm of the medium-sized (5 nm) AgNPs showed the best biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. Addition of smaller or larger AgNPs did not produce as substantial an effect in PEU, especially for the larger AgNPs. © 2010 Lu et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

0036122686	Effect of different solvents and crosslinkers on cytocompatibility of Type II collagen scaffolds for chondrocyte seeding	Type II collagen extracted from porcine costal cartilage was evaluated as scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering. Chemical crosslinkers were employed to improve the mechanical properties and the resistance toward degradation. Films and porous scaffolds were prepared from collagen solutions dissolved in 3% acetic acid (designated A) or in deionized water (designated W) and crosslinked by an epoxy (designated E) or by a carbodiimide (designated C). Immortalized rat chondrocytes and rabbit chondrocytes were used to assess cytocompatibility of crosslinked collagen matrices. Cell adhesion rate onto the films made by different preparations ranked in the order of WE ≥ WC > AC ≥ AE. Cell proliferation ranked in the order of AC > WC > AE ≥ WE. Cells maintained round morphology only on AC and WC films. In 3-D seeding, AC scaffolds also were found to be the most cytocompatible. WC scaffolds, however, had better dimensional stability. It was concluded that Type II collagen scaffolds, when prepared by using deionized water as the solvent and carbodiimide as the crosslinker, could promote chondrocyte growth and matrix production.

0036131542	Preparation of controlled release ophthalmic drops, for glaucoma therapy using thermosensitive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide	In this study, controlled release ophthalmic agents for glaucoma therapy were developed based on the thermosensitivity of poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAAm). The clear solution of PNIPAAm was known to undergo phase transition when the temperature was raised from the room temperature to about 32°C. The drug was entrapped in the tangled polymer chains or encapsulated within the crosslinked polymer hydrogel at room temperature, and released progressively after topical application (i.e., at a higher temperature). Linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked PNIAAm nanoparticles containing epinephrine were prepared. The drug release rate and cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro. Ophthalmic formulations based on either linear PNIPAAm or the mixture of linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked PNIPAAm nanoparticles were administered to rabbits and the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect was evaluated. The decreased pressure response of the formulation based on linear PNIPAAm lasted six-fold longer than that of the conventional eye drop. Furthermore, for formulation based on the mixture of linear PNIPAAm and crosslinked nanoparticles, the pressure-lowering effect lasted eight times longer. These results suggest the use of thermosensitive polymer solutions or hydrogels is potential in controlled release antiglaucoma ophthalmic drugs. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0035985045	Evaluation of cellular affinity and compatibility to biodegradable polyesters and Type-II collagen-modified scaffolds using immortalized rat chondrocytes	Immortalized rat chondrocytes (IRCs) were employed to evaluate the cytocompatibility of different biodegradable polyester scaffolds for chondrocyte seeding and cartilage tissue engineering in vitro due to the limitation of using freshly harvested chondroctyes. Cells were seeded onto the films and the porous substrates as well as into the three-dimensional scaffolds made of the biodegradable polyesters including poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and two poly(lactide-co-glycolide)s (PLGAs). The materials were characterized by water contact angle, electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA), and microscopy. PLGA50/50, one of the PLGAs, had the largest cell numbers at 24 h and 96 h (close to the tissue culture polystyrene control), possibly due to its lower contact angle, higher oxygen/carbon (O/C) atomic ratio, and larger degradation rate. When the surface was further modified by cross-linked Type-II collagen, cell population was significantly enhanced (two- to fourfold). The adhesion and proliferation behavior of IRCs on different materials was parallel to that of rabbit chondrocytes, but was more reproducible in general. IRCs are thus suitable for evaluation of different polymer scaffolds. Despite the favorable cytocompatibility of PLGA50/50, blending with a small portion of PLLA is required for easy fabrication and collagen modification. Scaffolds made of blended materials by freeze-drying procedure with the surface modified by cross-linked Type-II collagen were demonstrated as the ideal templates for chondrocyte seeding in our study.

79957609741	Chondrogenesis from human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells in three-dimensional scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering	Human placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hPMSCs) represent a promising source of stem cells. The application of hPMSCs in cartilage tissue engineering, however, was less reported. In this study, hPMSCs were grown in a three-dimensional (3D) environment for cartilage tissue formation in vitro. To select proper scaffolds for 3D culture of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), rat adipose-derived MSCs were initially employed to optimize the composition and condition of the 3D environment. The suitability of a poly(d,l-lactide-co- glycolide) (PLGA) precision scaffold previously developed for seeding and culture of primary chondrocytes was tested for MSCs. It was established that MSCs had to be embedded in alginate gel before seeded in the PLGA precision scaffold for cartilage-like tissue formation. The inclusion of nano-sized calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (nCDHA) and/or a recombinant protein containing arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) into the alginate gel enhanced the chondrogenesis for both rat adipose-derived MSCs and hPMSCs. The amount of extracellular matrix such as glycosaminoglycan and type II collagen accumulated during a period of 21 days was found to be the greatest for hPMSCs embedded in the alginate/nCDHA/RGD gel and injected and cultivated in the precision scaffold. Also, histological analyses revealed the lacunae formation and extracellular matrix production from the seeded hPMSCs. Comparing human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs) and hPMSCs grown in the previous composite scaffolds, the secretion of glycosaminoglycan was twice as higher for hPMSCs as that for hBMSCs. It was concluded that the alginate/nCDHA/RGD mixed gel in the aforementioned system could provide a 3D environment for the chondrogenesis of hPMSCs, and the PLGA precision scaffold could provide the dimensional stability of the whole construct. This study also suggested that hPMSCs, when grown in a suitable scaffold, may be a good source of stem cells for building up the tissue-engineered cartilage. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

79960622699	Review: Bioengineering approaches for guided peripheral	Peripheral nerve injury is a serious health concern for society, affecting 2.8% of trauma patients, many of whom acquire long-term disability, and the related socioeconomic costs are relatively expensive. Current techniques in peripheral nerve repair include the use of autografts and nerve conduits to bridge the nerve gap. Bioengineers have developed a variety of nerve conduits to improve nerve regeneration, as well as employed functionalized bioactive additives to the nerve conduits. Within such a discipline, adequate evaluation methods are extremely important for correctly assessing nerve repair and regeneration. There are histological, electrophysiological or functional analyses. This article reviews the research efforts that integrate bioengineering approaches.

79960846930	Spheroid formation of mesenchymal stem cells on chitosan and chitosan-hyaluronan membranes	Stem cells can lose their primitive properties during in vitro culture. The culture substrate may affect the behavior of stem cells as a result of cell-substrate interaction. The maintenance of self-renewal for adult human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by a biomaterial substrate, however, has not been reported in literature. In this study, MSCs isolated from human adipose (hADAS) and placenta (hPDMC) were cultured on chitosan membranes and those further modified by hyaluronan (chitosan-HA). It was observed that the MSCs of either origin formed three-dimensional spheroids that kept attached on the membranes. Spheroid formation was associated with the increased MMP-2 expression. Cells on chitosan-HA formed spheroids more quickly and the size of spheroids were larger than on chitosan alone. The expression of stemness marker genes (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) for MSCs on the materials was analyzed by the real-time RT-PCR. It was found that formation of spheroids on chitosan and chitosan-HA membranes helped to maintain the expression of stemness marker genes of MSCs compared to culturing cells on polystyrene dish. The maintenance of stemness marker gene expression was especially remarkable in hPDMC spheroids (vs. hADAS spheroids). Blocking CD44 by antibodies prevented the spheroid formation and decreased the stemness gene expression moderately; while treatment by Y-27632 compound inhibited the spheroid formation and significantly decreased the stemness gene expression. Upon chondrogenic induction, the MSC spheroids showed higher levels of Sox9, aggrecan, and collagen type II gene expression and were stained positive for glycosaminoglycan and collagen type II. hPDMC had better chondrogenic differentiation potential than hADAS upon induction. Our study suggested that the formation of adhered spheroids on chitosan and chitosan-HA membranes may sustain the expression of stemness marker genes of MSCs and increase their chondrogenic differentiation capacity. The Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway may be involved in spheroid formation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

80053179396	The biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites from polyurethane and nano silicate platelets	Nanocomposites from a polyether-type waterborne polyurethane (PU) and 0.1 wt % of silicate materials were prepared. The individual silicate materials were natural clays (montmorillonite and mica), their exfoliated clays [nano silicate platelets (NSP) and nano mica platelets], and NSP modified with C18 fatty amine (NSP-S). The physico-chemcical properties and antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposites were characterized in vitro. The biostability and biocompatibility of the nanocomposites were evaluated in vivo. The nanocomposites exhibited various surface morphologies with phase separation of hard and soft domains in nanometric scales. The nanocomposite containing NSP (PU-NSP) showed better endothelial cell attachment and gene expression. The better biocompatibility of PU-NSP and PU-NSP-S was evidenced by the lower thickness of foreign body capsules in rat subcutaneous implantation. PU-NSP had the least surface degradation in vivo as demonstrated by the electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. This may be associated with the different surface structure. PU-NSP and PU-NSP-S showed strong bacteriostatic effects, which suggested that the nano clay in the polymer matrix may still interact with the microbes. Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

80255132958	Comparison between two different methods of immobilizing NGF in poly(DL -lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) conduit for peripheral nerve regeneration by EDC/NHS/MES and genipin	For surface modification and nerve regeneration, chitosan, followed by nerve growth factor (NGF), was immobilized onto the interior surface of poly (lactic acit-co-glycolic) conduits, using EDC/NHS/MES system (EDCs) and genipin (GP). Four new conduits were, therefore, obtained and named by immobilizing order-EDCs/EDCs, GP/EDCs, EDCs/GP, and GP/GP groups. The immobilized methods used were evaluated and compared, respectively. The researchers found that the EDCs- and GP-cross-linked chitosan displayed higher hydrophilic than pure poly (DL-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) in water contact angle experiment, which meant the cell compatibility was improved by the modification. Scanning electron microscopic observations revealed that the GP-cross-linking of chitosan greatly improved cell compatibility while cultured rat PC12 cells were flatter and more spindle-shaped than EDCs-cross-linked chitosan. The results concerning the GP-cross-linked chitosan revealed significant proliferation of the seeded cells relative to pure PLGA films, as determined by counting cells and MTT assay. The NGF was released from the modified conduits in two separate periods-an initial burst in 5 days and then slow release from day 10 to day 40. The GP/EDCs group had the highest NGF value among all groups after the 5th day. Finally, the controlled-release conduits were used to bridge a 10 mm rat sciatic nerve defect. Six weeks following implantation, morphological analysis revealed the highest numbers of myelinated axons in the midconduit and distal regenerated nerve in GP/EDCs group. Therefore, the results confirm that GP/EDCs groups with good cell compatibility and effective release of NGF can considerably improve peripheral nerve regeneration.

81855194111	Mediation of the migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts on polyurethane nanocomposites by the activation of integrin-focal adhesion kinase signaling	Model surfaces of polyurethane-gold nanocomposites (PU-Au) were used to examine cell behavior on nanophase-segregated materials. Previously we showed that endothelial cell (EC) migration on these materials was modulated by the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway. The present study, investigated the expressions of alpha5/beta3 (α5β3) integrin, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and other downstream signal molecules such as the Rho family and matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP-2) induced by the materials in two different cells, that is bovine arterial endothelial cells (BAEC) and human skin fibroblasts (HSF). Both cells proliferated better on the more phase-separated PU-Au 43.5 ppm than on the less phase-separated controls (PU and PU-Au 174 ppm). On PU-Au 43.5 ppm, BAEC compared to HSF had denser actin fibers and were more extended. BAEC became rounded with Y-27632 treatment and shrunk with LY294002 treatment. Treatment by inhibitors only caused slight changes in HSF. The migration distance of BAEC on PU-Au 43.5 ppm was greater than that of HSF, and was significantly reduced by LY294002 or Y-27632 but not SU-1498. The expressions of p-FAK, p-RhoA, p-Rac/Cdc42, MMP2, and α5β3 integrin induced by PU-Au 43.5 ppm were more pronounced in BAEC versus HSF. Further enhancement in MMP2 and α5β3 integrin expressions by FAK-GFP transfection was more remarkable for cells on PU-Au 43.5 ppm. Our findings suggested that the integrin α5β3/FAK pathway may be induced by nanophase-separated materials in both ECs and fibroblasts to promote their proliferation/migration, while the crosstalk between the PI3K/Akt/eNOS pathway and FAK/Rho-GTPase activation may account for the greater effect in ECs than in fibroblasts.

84855408102	Enhanced chondrogenic differentiation potential of human gingival fibroblasts by spheroid formation on chitosan membranes	Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were recently found to be a source of mesenchymal stem cells. Their behavior on a biomaterial has not been reported so far. The effect of culturing HGF on chitosan membranes on their chondrogenic differentiation was investigated in this study. HGF were first cultured on chitosan membranes and spheroid formation of HGF was observed. Next, HGF on chitosan were induced with chondrogenesis induction medium and their chondrogenic differentiation potential was expressed by assessing the expression of chondrogenesis related genes at both mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunostaining, respectively. We discovered that the chondrogenic differentiation potential of HGF could be enhanced simply by culturing HGF on chitosan membranes. Expression of neural crest and stemness genes were also analyzed by RT-PCR to evaluate the stemness and self-renewal of HGF spheroids. We found that spheroid formation helped to increase and maintain the expression of stemness genes in HGF. To understand the aspects of the chitosan membranes that induced spheroid formation of HGF, mechanical and physical properties of the chitosan membranes were examined. The migration of HGF on chitosan membranes was also monitored to speculate the process of spheroid formation. In addition, the roles of the Rho/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway and connexin 43 (Cx43) in spheroid formation were explored. Treatment of HGF cultured on chitosan with the ROCK-activity inhibitor Y27632 clearly inhibited spheroid formation, suggesting that the Rho/ROCK pathway was involved in spheroid formation. The increased Cx43 activity of HGF spheroids on chitosan indicated that the gap junction intercellular communication was regulated by spheroid formation. It was concluded that culturing HGF on chitosan may activate the Rho/ROCK pathway, which led to spheroid formation and gap junction regulation. These changes may contribute to the enhanced chondrogenic differentiation potential of HGF on chitosan. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

84857826907	Air plasma treated chitosan fibers-stacked scaffolds	Chitosan is a nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible polymer. Rapid prototyped chitosan scaffolds were manufactured by liquid-frozen deposition of chitosan fibers in this study. To investigate if the air plasma (AP) treatment could be used to improve the surface properties of these scaffolds for cell attachment, chitosan films were first prepared and treated with AP under different conditions. Under the optimized condition, the water contact angle of chitosan films was significantly reduced from 90 1° to 19 1° after AP treatment. On the other hand, the surface charge and nanometric roughness of chitosan films increased after AP treatment. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement on AP-treated three-dimensional chitosan scaffolds showed that nitrogen and oxygen increased at each location inside the scaffolds as compared to the untreated ones, which indicated that AP could permeate through the fibrous stacks of the scaffolds and effectively modify the interior (visible) surface of the scaffolds. Moreover, AP treatment enabled the migration of MC3T3-E1 cells into the scaffolds, facilitated their proliferation and promoted the bone mineral deposition. These results suggested that fibers-stacked chitosan scaffolds may be produced by liquid-frozen deposition and treated with AP for bone tissue engineering applications. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84855944209	The cellular responses and antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles stabilized by different polymers	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their excellent antibacterial activities. The possible toxicity, however, is a major concern for their applications. Three types of AgNPs were prepared in this study by chemical processes. Each was stabilized by a polymer surfactant, which was expected to reduce the exposure of cells to AgNPs and therefore their cytotoxicity. The polymer stabilizers included poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM), poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride)-grafting poly(oxyalkylene) (SMA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The cytotoxicity of these chemically produced AgNPs to mouse skin fibroblasts (L929), human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2), and mouse monocyte macrophages (J774A1) was compared to that of physically produced AgNPs and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as well as the standard reference material RM8011 AuNPs. Results showed that SMA-AgNPs were the least cytotoxic among all materials, but cytotoxicity was still observed at higher silver concentrations (>30ppm). Macrophages demonstrated the inflammatory response with cell size increase and viability decrease upon exposure to 10ppm of the chemically produced AgNPs. SMA-AgNPs did not induce hemolysis at a silver concentration below 1.5ppm. Regarding the antibacterial activity, POEM-AgNPs and SMA-AgNPs at 1ppm silver content showed 99.9% and 99.3% growth inhibition against E. coli, while PVA-AgNPs at the same silver concentration displayed 79.1% inhibition. Overall, SMA-AgNPs demonstrated better safety in vitro and greater antibacterial effects than POEM-AgNPs and PVA-AgNPs. This study suggested that polymer stabilizers may play an important role in determining the toxicity of AgNPs. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84855967760	Isolation of the multipotent MSC subpopulation from human gingival fibroblasts by culturing on chitosan membranes	Literature has different opinions regarding the percentage of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like population in human gingival tissue. Isolation of these cells is thus important for clinical applications. In this study, two typical but distinct types of gingival fibroblasts (GF), GF-A and GF-B, were grown from human gingival biopsies. They were characterized for surface markers by flow cytometry as well as the expressions of stemness and neural crest marker genes by RT-PCR. The two types of GF were slightly different in their surface markers; however, they had dramatic difference in the expression levels of stemness marker genes and neural crest marker genes. They also demonstrated distinct differentiation capacity. Upon the appropriate induction, GF-A were capable of osteogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and neurogenic differentiation while GF-B only underwent osteogenic differentiation. By culturing either type of GF on chitosan membranes for 24h, we were able to isolate two distinct subpopulations in each type of GF, i.e. cells with spheroid-forming ability (GF-AS and GF-BS) or those remained flat and attached (GF-AN and GF-BN). We further characterized these cells, and determined the common properties shared by the spheroid-forming subpopulation " S" , as well as those shared by the non-spheroid-forming subpopulation " N" The subpopulation " S" was capable of the multilineage differentiation, while the subpopulation " N" was only efficient in osteogenic differentiation. GF-A and GF-B had different proportions of subpopulations. Chitosan as the cell culture substratum up-regulated the N-cadherin expression of the " S" but not " N" subpopulation, which may account for the cell sorting effect. This study showed that chitosan membranes could be used for isolation of the spheroid forming subpopulation in human GF that contained multipotent adult stem cells of which the number varied among donors and sites. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84864022417	Spheroid formation from neural stem cells on chitosan membranes	This study demonstrates neural stem cells forming neurosphere-like three-dimensional adherent spheroids on chitosan membranes. Their state can be maintained for at least fifteen days, during which period the spheroids increase their size and number. After this period, the neural stem cells start to migrate out of the spheroids, which change in size when the culture period is prolonged. It is believed that the spheroid formation on chitosan can maintain the self-renewal and plasticity of neural stem cells for weeks, with differentiation possibly occurring at a later period. The culture of neural stem cells on certain chitosan membranes can be used to purify neural stem cells from a heterogeneous cell population.

0037262541	The effects of Ginkgo biloba extracts on the memory and motor functions of rats with chronic cerebral insufficiency	The main goal of the curren study was to investigate the effects of two Ginkgo leaf extracts, EGb 761 and an extract of local Ginkgo leaf (LGb), on the memory and motor functions of rats with chronic cerebral insufficiency (produced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation). After the operation, spatial memory and motor functions were tested for over 80 days. Tests included (1) radial-arm maze test for testing spatial memory and locomotor activity and (2) muscle force and hind limbs for escape. The results indicate that both EGb 761 and LGb improved spatial memory from the second week after operation, but only EGb 761 delayed deterioration of motor functions from the fifth week after operation.

0037662070	Surface grafting polymerization and crosslinking of thermosensitive NiPAAm hydrogels onto plasma pretreated substrates and drug delivery properties	Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogel has a lower critical solution temperature (LCST), and exhibits a discontinuous volume phase transition in response to a small temperature change. PNIPAAm have been widely investigated in the fields of drug-delivery systems, diagnostics, bioreactors, cell culture and bioseperations. Since the mechanical strength of hydrogels with high water content is not enough for its application, therefore PNIPAAm gel have been grafted onto the polymers to improve mechanical properties. Photo-induced graft polymerization of NIPAAm with plasma pretreatment on PP non-woven was carried out at 65°Cin a water medium. The effect of crosslinking density on drug release behavior of the nonwoven-gel composites was investigated by preparing the hydrogels with various crosslinking densities. The results shown that the nonwoven-gel composites exhibited a fast temperature-responsive character and that the crosslinking density strongly affected the swelling ratio and drug release ratio but not change the LCST of the hydrogels.

The chitosan/alginate (CA) gel was further grafted onto the PU-g-AA modified PU films by using 1-ethyl-3- (3-dimethyamino propyl) carbodiimide (EDC). The PU-g-AA modified PU films were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. The effect of acrylic acid and CA gel grafting on the properties was investigated. The results show that the PU films exhibited were sufficiently strength and that the acrylic acid was grafted onto PU films by γ-ray irradiation. The hydrophility of PU films significantly increased after graft polymerization with γ-ray irradiation.

84868155542	Human endothelial cell response to polyurethane-gold nanocomposites	Gold (Au) is long considered as a biocompatible metal, and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs ∼5 nm) were recently reported to scavenge free radicals. The effect of Au embedded in a polymeric material is less investigated compared with that of silver. In this study, nanocomposites from polyurethane (PU) and 43.5 or 174 ppm of AuNPs were prepared from a waterborne process. The response of endothelial cells (ECs) to the PU-Au nanocomposites was investigated in vitro and in vivo. ECs on PU-Au nanocomposites showed lamellipodia formation and better cell proliferation. The activation of proteins in ECs grown on PU-Au nanocomposites was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and confirmed by Western blot. The new protein identified through this procedure was valosin-containing protein (VCP), which is known to have immunomodulating effect. VCP was upregulated by PU-Au 43.5 ppm and PU-Au 174 ppm, but more in PU-Au 43.5 ppm. This suggested that the dispersion of AuNPs in the polymer matrix may be more important than the loading amount. PU-Au catheters implanted in rat blood vessels showed less foreign body reaction and more extensive EC coverage than the control PU catheters. The good in vivo biocompatibility of PU-Au may be associated with the antiinflammatory effect of PU-Au. Based on this study, AuNPs may serve as an antioxidant additive for biomedical polymers. © The Author(s) 2012. This article is published with open access at Springerlink.com.

84870336777	Efficacy and safety of nanohybrids comprising silver nanoparticles and silicate clay for controlling Salmonella infection	Developing effective and safe drugs is imperative for replacing antibiotics and controlling multidrug-resistant microbes. Nanoscale silicate platelet (NSP) and its nanohybrid, silver nanoparticle/NSP (AgNP/NSP), have been developed, and the nanohybrids show a strong and general antibacterial activity in vitro. Here, their efficacy for protecting Salmonella-infected chicks from fatality and septicemia was evaluated. Both orally administrated NSP and AgNP/ NSP, but not AgNPs alone, effectively reduced the systemic Salmonella infection and mortality. In addition, quantitative Ag analyses demonstrated that Ag deposition from AgNP/NSP in the intestines was less than that from conventional AgNPs, indicating that the presence of NSP for immobilizing AgNPs reduced Ag accumulation in tissue and improved the safety of AgNPs. These in vivo results illustrated that both NSP and AgNP/NSP nanohybrid represent potential agents for controlling enteric bacterial infections. © 2012 Chiao et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84871998722	Characterization of chitosan-gelatin scaffolds for dermal tissue engineering	Porous scaffolds for dermal tissue engineering were fabricated by freeze-drying a mixture of chitosan and gelatin (CG) solutions. Different crosslinking agents including glutaraldehyde, 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodimide hydrochloride (EDC), and genipin were used to crosslink the scaffolds and improve their biostability. The porous structure and mechanical properties were determined for the scaffolds. The proliferation of human fibroblasts in the scaffolds was analyzed. It was found that EDC crosslinked scaffolds had the greatest amount of cells after four days. EDC crosslinked CG scaffolds had tensile modulus in a dry state and compressive modulus in a wet state similar to commercial collagen wound dressing. They also showed appropriate pore size, high water absorption, and good dimensional stability during cell culture. When human fibroblasts were seeded on acellular porcine dermis (APD), acellular human dermis (AHD), and CG scaffolds for 3D cell culture, they were well-distributed in the centre of the CG scaffolds but stayed only on the superficial layer of APD or AHD after seven days. A gelatin-based bioglue was applied to the CG scaffolds where the keratinocytes were seeded to mimic epidermal structure. After 14days, the bioglue degraded and keratinocytes grew to form monolayers on the scaffolds. This study showed that CG scaffolds crosslinked by EDC and seeded with human fibroblasts could serve as dermal constructs, while the bioglue coating seeded with keratinocytes could serve as an epidermal construct. Such a combination could help regenerate skin with integrated dermal and epidermal layers and a have potential use in tissue-engineered skin. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84872871990	Evaluation of the antibacterial activity and biocompatibility for silver nanoparticles immobilized on nano silicate platelets	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their bactericidal abilities. The antibacterial potency is dependent on the particle size and dispersion status. In this study, we synthesized AgNP/NSP nanohybrids in two different weight ratios (1/99 and 8/92) using the fully exfoliated clay, i.e., nanosilicate platelets (NSP), as a dispersing agent and carrier for AgNPs. Due to the size of NSP, the immobilized AgNPs do not enter cells readily, which may lower the risk associated with the cellular uptake of AgNPs. The biocompatibility, immunological response, and antimicrobial activities of AgNP/NSP hybrids were evaluated. The results revealed that AgNP/NSP hybrids elicited merely mild inflammatory response and retained the outstanding antibacterial activity. The hybrids were further embedded in poly(ether)urethane (PEU) to increase the biocompatibility. At the same silver content (20 ppm), the PEU-AgNP/NSP nanocomposites were nontoxic to mouse skin fibroblasts, while simultaneously exhibiting nearly complete bacterial growth reduction (99.9%). PEU containing the same amount of free AgNPs did not display such an effect. Our results verify the better biosafety of the AgNPs/NSP hybrids and their polymer nanocomposites for further clinical use. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84874275277	The role of RhoA kinase inhibition in human placenta-derived multipotent cells on neural phenotype and cell survival	Current advances in stem cell biology have brought much hope for therapy of neuro-degenerative diseases. However, neural stem cells (NSCs) are rare adult stem cells, and the use of non-NSCs requires efficient and high-yielding lineage-specific differentiation prior to transplantation for efficacy. We report on the efficient differentiation of placental-derived multipotent cells (PDMCs) into a neural phenotype with use of Y-27632, a clinically compliant small molecular inhibitor of Rho kinase (ROCK) which is a major mediator of cytoskeleton dynamics. Y-27632 does not induce differentiation of PDMC toward the mesodermal lineages of adipogenesis and osteogenesis, but rather a neural-like morphology, with rapid development of cell extensions and processes within 24 h. Compared with conventional neurogenic differentiation agents, Y-27632 induces a higher percentage of neural-like cells in PDMCs without arresting proliferation or cell cycle dynamics. Y-27632-treated PDMCs express several neural lineage genes at the RNA and protein level, including nestin, MAP2, and GFAP. The effect of the ROCK inhibitor is cell-specific to PDMCs, and is mainly mediated through the ROCK2 isoform and its downstream target, myosin II. Our data suggest that ROCK inhibition and cytoskeletal rearrangement may allow for induction of a neural phenotype in PDMCs without compromising cell survival. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875799674	Bacterial cellulose and bacterial cellulose-chitosan membranes for wound dressing applications	Bacterial cellulose (BC) and bacterial cellulose-chitosan (BC-Ch) membranes were successfully produced in large scale. BC was synthesized by Acetobacter xylinum. BC-Ch was prepared by immersing BC in chitosan followed by freeze-drying. The surface morphology of BC and BC-Ch membranes were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). SEM images showed that BC-Ch possessed a denser fibril network with smaller pores than BC. Infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the incorporation of chitosan in BC-Ch. The swelling behavior, water retention capacity, and mechanical properties of BC and BC-Ch were further evaluated. Results indicated that both membranes maintained proper moisture contents for an extensive period without dehydration. The tensile strength and elongation at break for BC-Ch were slightly lower while the Young's modulus was higher. Cell culture studies demonstrated that BC and BC-Ch had no cytotoxicity. In the antibacterial test, the addition of chitosan in BC showed significant growth inhibition against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The effects of BC and BC-Ch on skin wound healing were assessed by rat models. Histological examinations revealed that wounds treated with BC-Ch epithelialized and regenerated faster than those treated with BC or Tegaderm. Therefore, BC-Ch was considered as a potential candidate for wound dressing materials. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84876090357	Substrate-dependent Wnt signaling in MSC differentiation within biomaterial-derived 3D spheroids	A unique biomaterial-based system was developed to generate dynamic three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs were cultured on transparent membranes made of chitosan or those further grafted with hyaluronan (HA) in different densities. MSCs vigorously migrated and were self-assembled into highly mobile 3D spheroids with substrate-dependent upregulation of adhesion molecule N-cadherin. MSC spheroids showed increased expression of Wnt genes/proteins and substrate-dependent cell fate. The correlation of differentiation capacities with Wnt signaling and crosstalk with other pathways such as ERK1/2 or Smad2/3 were observed for MSC spheroids but not for the conventional 2D cultured cells. Wnt3a-mediated canonical Wnt signaling was more active for MSC spheroids derived on chitosan, which were prone to osteogenesis. Wnt5a-mediated non-canonical Wnt signaling was more active for MSC spheroids derived on HA-grafted chitosan, which were prone to chondrogenesis. In particular, the relative importance of Wnt5a-mediated non-canonical vs. Wnt3a-mediated canonical Wnt signals in determining the cell fate was controlled by the grafting density of HA on chitosan. Treatment with the inhibitor of canonical Wnt-associated signaling molecules suppressed the osteogenesis of MSC spheroids on chitosan. This study demonstrates that Wnt signaling of MSCs is distinct in 3D environment and is substrate-dependent. The convenient 3D platform may be used to examine the role of Wnt signaling in controlling MSC fate under different extracellular environments, and potentially applied to study stem cell behavior in regenerative medicine, normal development, and cancer. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84876883602	Amphiphilic silver-delaminated clay nanohybrids and their composites with polyurethane: Physico-chemical and biological evaluations	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) exhibit size-dependent bactericidal activity. They are, however, subject to aggregation when added to most hydrophobic polymers. In this study, a surfactant-modified delaminated clay (surfactant-capped nanosilicate platelets, or "NSQ") was employed to be a nanocarrier for AgNPs. The nanohybrid of AgNPs and NSQ ("AgNP/ NSQ") in aqueous solution showed remarkable bactericidal effect as well as negligible cytotoxicity and immune response at a concentration of 10 ppm. Poly(carbonate)urethane (PCU) with different hard/soft segment ratios was synthesized and used in the preparation of the nanocomposites, PCU-AgNP/NSQ. Based on TEM observation, AgNP/NSQ was well dispersed in the resulting nanocomposites. The reinforcing effects of AgNP/NSQ in nanocomposites were distinct for PCU with different hard/soft segment ratios. The phase-separated structure of PCU-AgNP/NSQ nanocomposites was investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). PCU-AgNP/NSQ containing 75 ppm of Ag demonstrated superior microbiostatic effect, as well as better biodurability and lower foreign body reaction than the commercial Pellethane 2363-80A. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84877698406	Novel nanostructured biodegradable polymer matrices fabricated by phase separation techniques for tissue regeneration	Biomimetic nanostructures have a wide range of applications. In particular, biodegradable polymer nanostructures that mimic the subtleties of extracellular matrix may provide favorable cell interactions. In this study, a co-solvent system was developed to configure a thermodynamically metastable biodegradable polymer solution, from which novel nanostructured matrices subsequently formed via wet phase separation (quaternary) or a combination with thermally induced phase separation. Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructured porous matrices were further fabricated by combination with particle-leaching (100-300 μm glucose). The new co-solvent system may generate matrices with reproducible nanostructures from a variety of biodegradable polymers such as poly(d,l-lactide) (PLA), poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and PCL-based polyurethane. In vitro cell culture experiments were performed with mouse pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1) and human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSC) to evaluate the osteoinductive potential of PLA nanostructures. The results showed that nanofibrous (<100 nm) membranes promoted the bone-related marker gene expression and matrix mineralization of MC3T3-E1 at 14 days. Nanofibrous 3D matrices seeded with hBM-MSC without osteogenic induction supplements demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in bone matrix deposition vs. the conventional microporous matrices after 14 and 21 days. Antimicrobial nanofibers were further obtained by plasma-assisted coating of chitosan on PLA nanofibers. This study reveals a platform for fabricating novel biodegradable nanofibrous architecture, with potential in tissue regeneration. © 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

84878242964	Enhanced migration of Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells grown on polyurethane nanocomposites	Mesenchymal stem cells can sense and respond to substrate stiffness and topography, which modulates their differentiation into special cell lineages. Vascular cells reside in an elastic extracellular environment and are subjected to normal as well as shear forces. Polyurethane (PU), a synthetic elastomer, is investigated in this study for its potential to promote the attachment and migration of Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSCs). A nanocomposite of PU containing gold nanoparticles (PU-Au) with distinct phase separation on the nanometer scale is also tested because it provides better mechanical/topographical cues compared to those of pristine PU. PU-Au up-regulates the protein expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Rho-GTPase/matrix metalloproteinase-9 in WJMSCs upon the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). Furthermore, PU-Au improves the attachment and migration of WJMSCs and increases the expression levels of cell surface markers such as CXCR4 and α5β3 integrin after VEGF and SDF-1 stimulation. Collectively, these results suggest that elastic nanocomposites such as PU-Au may enhance WJMSC migration in response to tissue and blood vessel injury, which may in turn contribute to neovascularization in a vascular lesion.

84879471229	Mesenchymal stem cells from a hypoxic culture improve and engraft achilles tendon repair	Background: Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from humans cultured under hypoxic conditions increase bone healing capacity. Hypothesis: Rat MSCs cultured under hypoxic conditions increase the tendon healing potential after transplantation into injured Achilles tendons. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Biomechanical testing, histological analysis, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling/collagen immunohistochemistry were performed to demonstrate that augmentation of an Achilles tendon rupture site with hypoxic MSCs increases healing capacity compared with normoxic MSCs and controls. Fifty Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the experiments, with 2 rats as the source of bone marrow MSCs. The cut Achilles tendons in the rats were equally divided into 3 groups: hypoxic MSC, normoxic MSC, and nontreated (vehicle control). The uncut tendons served as normal uncut controls. Outcome measures included mechanical testing in 24 rats, histological analysis, and BrdU labeling/collagen immunohistochemistry in another 24 rats. Results: The ultimate failure load in the hypoxic MSC group was significantly greater than that in the nontreated or normoxic MSC group at 2 weeks after incision (2.1 N/mm

84879477478	Biocompatibility and Favorable Response of Mesenchymal Stem Cells on Fibronectin-Gold Nanocomposites	A simple surface modification method, comprising of a thin coating with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and fibronectin (FN), was developed to improve the biocompatibility required for cardiovascular devices. The nanocomposites from FN and AuNPs (FN-Au) were characterized by the atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis spectrophotometry (UV-Vis), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The biocompatibility of the nanocomposites was evaluated by the response of monocytes and platelets to the material surface in vitro. FN-Au coated surfaces demonstrated low monocyte activation and platelet activation. The behavior of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on FN-Au was further investigated. MSCs on FN-Au nanocomposites particularly that containing 43.5 ppm of AuNPs (FN-Au 43.5 ppm) showed cell proliferation, low ROS generation, as well as increases in the protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which may account for the enhanced MSC migration on the nanocomposites. These results suggest that the FN-Au nanocomposite thin film coating may serve as a potential and simple solution for the surface modification of blood-contacting devices such as vascular grafts. © 2013 Hung et al.

84883067464	Fabrication of bioactive conduits containing the fibroblast growth factor 1 and neural stem cells for peripheral nerve regeneration across a 15 mm critical gap	Nerve conduits are often used in combination with bioactive molecules and stem cells to enhance peripheral nerve regeneration. In this study, the acidic fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) was immobilized onto the microporous/ micropatterned poly (D, L-lactic acid) (PLA) nerve conduits after open air plasma treatment. PLA substrates grafted with chitosan in the presence of a small amount of gold nanoparticles (nano Au) showed a protective effect on the activity of the immobilized FGF1 in vitro. Different conduits were tested for their ability to bridge a 15 mm critical gap defect in a rat sciatic nerve injury model. Axon regeneration and functional recovery were evaluated by histology, walking track analysis and electrophysiology. Among different conduits, PLA conduits grafted with chitosan-nano Au and the FGF1 after plasma activation had the greatest regeneration capacity and functional recovery in the experimental animals. When the above conduit was seeded with aligned neural stem cells, the efficacy was further enhanced and it approached that of the autograft group. This work suggested that microporous/micropatterned nerve conduits containing bioactive growth factors may be successfully fabricated by micropatterning techniques, open plasma activation, and immobilization, which, combined with aligned stem cells, may synergistically contribute to the regeneration of the severely damaged peripheral nerve. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84884223633	Long-term regeneration and functional recovery of a 15 mm critical nerve gap bridged by tremella fuciformis polysaccharide-immobilized polylactide conduits	Novel peripheral nerve conduits containing the negatively charged Tremella fuciformis polysaccharide (TF) were prepared, and their efficacy in bridging a critical nerve gap was evaluated. The conduits were made of poly(D,L-lactide) (PLA) with asymmetric microporous structure. TF was immobilized on the lumen surface of the nerve conduits after open air plasma activation. The TF-modified surface was characterized by the attenuated total reflection Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and the scanning electron microscopy. TF modification was found to enhance the neurotrophic gene expression of C6 glioma cells in vitro. TF-modified PLA nerve conduits were tested for their ability to bridge a 15 mm gap of rat sciatic nerve. Nerve regeneration was monitored by the magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed that TF immobilization promoted the nerve connection in 6 weeks. The functional recovery in animals receiving TF-immobilized conduits was greater than in those receiving the bare conduits during an 8-month period. The degree of functional recovery reached 90% after 8 months in the group of TF-immobilized conduits. © 2013 Shan-hui Hsu et al.

84885348574	Cell orientation and regulation of cell-cell communication in human mesenchymal stem cells on different patterns of electrospun fibers	Cell behavior can be manipulated by the topography of the culture surface. In this study, we examined the intercellular communication and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) grown on electrospun fibers with different orientations and densities. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hMSCs) were seeded on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) electrospun scaffolds composed of aligned (1D) or cross-aligned (2D) fibers (1.0-1.2 μm diameter) with high, medium, or low fiber densities. It was found that cells preferred to adhere onto electrospun PCL fibers rather than on the flat substrate. The immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of vinculin, a focal adhesion protein, was limited to the periphery and the two extremities of aligned cells on the edge of the fibers. Electron microscopy showed that cells extended their lamellipodia across the adjacent fibers and proliferated along the direction of fibers. Cells grown on 1D fibrous scaffolds at all fiber densities had an obvious alignment. On 2D fibers, a higher degree of cell alignment was observed at the higher fiber density. On 1D scaffolds, the gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) quantified by the lucifer yellow dye transfer assay was significantly promoted in the aligned cells in the direction parallel to the fibers but was abolished in the direction perpendicular to the fibers. The expression of osteogenic marker genes (RUNX2, ALP, and OCN) was significantly enhanced in seven days by culture on 1D but not 2D fibers. It was thus proposed that the promoted osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs may be associated with the fiber-guided and directional induction of GJIC. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84885906558	Solid freeform-fabricated scaffolds designed to carry multicellular mesenchymal stem cell spheroids for cartilage regeneration	Three-dimensional (3D) cellular spheroids have recently emerged as a new trend to replace suspended single cells in modern cell-based therapies because of their greater regeneration capacities in vitro. They may lose the 3D structure during a change of microenvironment, which poses challenges to their translation in vivo. Besides, the conventional microporous scaffolds may have diffculty in accommodating these relatively large spheroids. Here we revealed a novel design of microenvironment for delivering and sustaining the 3D spheroids. Biodegradable scaffolds with macroporosity to accommodate mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) spheroids were made by solid freeform fabrication (SFF) from the solution of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide). Their internal surface was modifed with chitosan following air plasma treatment in order to preserve the morphology of the spheroids. It was demonstrated that human MSC spheroids loaded in SFF scaffolds produced a signifcantly larger amount of cartilage-associated extracellular matrix in vitro and in NOD/SCID mice compared to single cells in the same scaffolds. Implantation of MSC spheroid-loaded scaffolds into the chondral defects of rabbit knees showed superior cartilage regeneration. This study establishes new perspectives in designing the spheroid-sustaining microenvironment within a tissue engineering scaffold for in vivo applications.

84886412254	Sciatic nerve regeneration by cocultured schwann cells and stem cells on microporous nerve conduits	Cell transplantation is a useful therapy for treating peripheral nerve injuries. The clinical use of Schwann cells (SCs), however, is limited because of their limited availability. An emerging solution to promote nerve regeneration is to apply injured nerves with stem cells derived from various tissues. In this study, different types of allogeneic cells including SCs, adipose-derived adult stem cells (ASCs), dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), and the combination of SCs with ASCs or DPSCs were seeded on nerve conduits to test their efficacy in repairing a 15-mm-long critical gap defect of rat sciatic nerve. The regeneration capacity and functional recovery were evaluated by the histological staining, electrophysiology, walking track, and functional gait analysis after 8 weeks of implantation. An in vitro study was also performed to verify if the combination of cells led to synergistic neurotrophic effects (NGF, BDNF, and GDNF). Experimental rats receiving conduits seeded with a combination of SCs and ASCs had the greatest functional recovery, as evaluated by the walking track, functional gait, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and histological analysis. Conduits seeded with cells were always superior to the blank conduits without cells. Regarding NCV and the number of blood vessels, conduits seeded with SCs and DPSCs exhibited better values than those seeded with DPSCs only. Results from the in vitro study confirmed the synergistic NGF production from the coculture of SCs and ASCs. It was concluded that coculture of SCs with ASCs or DPSCs in a conduit promoted peripheral nerve regeneration over a critical gap defect. © 2013 Cognizant Comm. Corp.

The cell retention and repopulation on these materials were observed in vitro. The results showed that the rheometer was a convenient tool to evaluate adhesive force and cell retention on a biomaterial substrate. On gelatin-coated surface, cells were more resistant to shear flow compared to those on tissue culture polystyrene or biocompatible poly(carbonate)urethane. The newly grown cells on the gelatin substrate after flushing for a period of time became further resistant to shear flow.

0346123063	In vitro evaluation of degradation and cytotoxicity of a novel composite as a bone substitute	The purpose of this study was to prepare and evaluate in vitro the feasibility and cytocompatibility of a novel composite (GGT) as a large defect bone substitute. The composite is tricalcium phosphate ceramic particles combined with genipin crosslinked gelatin. After soaking the GGT composites in Ringer solutions at 37°C for 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, and 84 days, the in vitro biologic degradation rate and biocompatibility were determined. Substances released from soaked GGT composites were analyzed with an ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometer. In addition, the solution soaking the GGT was co-cultured with osteoblasts to determine whether or not the released substances from GGT could facilitate the growth of bone cells. After they had been cultured for 2 days, the osteoblasts were tested for differentiation and proliferation by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and a MTT assay. Results indicate that the concentration of the genipin solution is a critical factor in deciding the crosslinking degree of the GGT composite. Complete crosslinking reaction in the GGT composite occurred when 0.5 wt % of genipin had been added. Cytotoxic testing revealed that 80 ppm of the genipin in the culture medium served as the level over which cytotoxicity to osteoblasts could be produced. In addition, we found that gelatin and calcium continuously were released from the GGT composite in the soaking solution, which promoted differentiation and proliferation of the osteoblasts. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84892476327	An improved bioassay facilitates the screening of repellents against cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae)	BACKGROUND: Repellents are a common method for preventing flea bites, making an effective system for flea repellent screening advantageous. We describe an improved technique to facilitate repellent activity screening of numerous plant-based Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea) repellents. RESULTS: Two long strips of filter paper were impregnated with test compounds (dissolved in ethanol) and ethanol only, respectively. After drying, the two filter papers were glued together along the long side and inserted into a glass tube containing non-fed cat fleas. The distribution of cat fleas in each half of the filter paper was recorded after 30 min to calculate repellency. Results showed that the essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloeum (from leaf), Taiwania cryptomerioides (from heartwood) and Plectranthus amboinicus (from leaf) exhibits repellent activity against cat fleas in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, the repellent activities against cat fleas of 2% trans-cinnamaldehyde (the main constituent of Ci. osmophloeum essential oil) and 0.5% thymol (the main constituent of P. amboinicus essential oil) are 97.6% and 90.6%, and can persist for up to 4 and 8 h, respectively. These results are comparable to those of 15% DEET. CONCLUSION: The proposed screening technique can facilitate the pre-screening of numerous flea repellents for further evaluation on animal or human subjects. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.

84891542239	Substrate-dependent gene regulation of self-assembled human MSC spheroids on chitosan membranes	Background: Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are generally regarded to have beneficial properties over MSCs in monolayer. Recent literatures have documented that MSCs can self-assemble into 3D spheroids with a greater capacity for differentiation into various cell types when grown on chitosan (CS), a biopolymer. The genomic modulation occurring in these MSC spheroids is thus of essential importance for understanding their uniqueness and therapeutic potentials. In this study, 3D spheroids self-assembled from human umbilical cord MSCs grown on CS membranes were analyzed by mRNA as well as microRNA microarrays, which helped identify the critical signaling events that may alter the cellular functions during the spheroid forming process.Results: Genes screened from mRNA and microRNA cross-correlation analyses were further confirmed with the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Results revealed the regulation of a significant number of calcium-associated genes, which suggested the crucial role of calcium signaling in CS-derived MSC spheroids. In addition, many genes associated with the multilineage differentiation capacities and those associated with the antiinflammatory and antitumor properties of MSCs were upregulated. The genetic modulation was significantly more remarkable and endured longer for MSC spheroids derived on CS substrates compared to those derived on a non-adherent (polyvinyl alcohol) substrate.Conclusions: Based on the study, the culture substrates used to prepare 3D MSC spheroids may predefine their properties through cell-substrate interaction. © 2014 Yeh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84896909316	Surfactant-Modified nanoclay exhibits an antiviral activity with high potency and broad spectrum	Nanomaterials have the characteristics associated with high surface-to-volume ratios and have been explored for their antiviral activity. Despite some success, cytotoxicity has been an issue in nanomaterial-based antiviral strategies. We previously developed a novel method to fully exfoliate montmorillonite clay to generate the most fundamental units of nanoscale silicate platelet (NSP). We further modified NSP by capping with various surfactants and found that the surfactant-modified NSP (NSQ) was less cytotoxic. In this study, we tested the antiviral potentials of a series of natural-clay-derived nanomaterials. Among the derivatives, NSP modified with anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (NSQc), but not the pristine clay, unmodified NSP, a silver nanoparticle- NSP hybrid, NSP modified with cationic n-octadecanylamine hydrochloride salt, or NSP modified with nonionic Triton X-100, significantly suppressed the plaque-forming ability of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) at noncytotoxic concentrations. NSQc also blocked infection with dengue virus (DEN) and influenza A virus. Regarding the antiviral mechanism, NSQc interfered with viral binding through electrostatic interaction, since its antiviral activity can be neutralized by Polybrene, a cationic polymer. Furthermore, NSQc reduced the lethality of JEV and DEN infection in mouse challenge models. Thus, the surfactantmodified exfoliated nanoclay NSQc may be a novel nanomaterial with broad and potent antiviral activity. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84899048542	Neocartilage formation from mesenchymal stem cells grown in type II collagen-hyaluronan composite scaffolds	Three-dimensional (3D) collagen type II-hyaluronan (HA) composite scaffolds (CII-HA) which mimics the extracellular environment of natural cartilage were fabricated in this study. Rheological measurements demonstrated that the incorporation of HA increased the compression modulus of the scaffolds. An initial in vitro evaluation showed that scaffolds seeded with porcine chondrocytes formed cartilaginous-like tissue after 8 weeks, and HA functioned to promote the growth of chondrocytes into scaffolds. Placenta-derived multipotent cells (PDMC) and gingival fibroblasts (GF) were seeded on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS), CII-HA films, and small intestinal submucosa (SIS) sheets for comparing their chondrogenesis differentiation potentials with those of adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADAS) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC). Among different cells, PDMC showed the greatest chondrogenic differentiation potential on both CII-HA films and SIS sheets upon TGF-β3 induction, followed by GF. This was evidenced by the up-regulation of chondrogenic genes (Sox9, aggrecan, and collagen type II), which was not observed for cells grown on TCPS. This finding suggested the essential role of substrate materials in the chondrogenic differentiation of PDMC and GF. Neocartilage formation was more obvious in both PDMC and GF cells plated on CII-HA composite scaffolds vs. 8-layer SIS at 28 days in vitro. Finally, implantation of PDMC/CII-HA constructs into NOD-SCID mice confirmed the formation of tissue-engineered cartilage in vivo. © 2013 International Society of Differentiation.

84899924504	Preparation and characterization of novel water-based biodegradable polyurethane nanoparticles encapsulating superparamagnetic iron oxide and hydrophobic drugs	Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO NPs) are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic hyperthermia. In this study, we used the self-assembly behavior of biodegradable polyurethane nanoparticles (PU NPs) in water to encapsulate SPIO NPs (SPIO-PU NPs) or hydrophobic model drugs (drug-PU NPs) by an in situ method. PU NPs and SPIO-PU NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The superparamagnetic property and magnetic heating ability of SPIO-PU NPs were assessed. PU NPs had no significant cytotoxicity and could be taken up by cells. SPIO-PU NPs were highly efficient in labeling cancer cells with cellular uptake of ∼16 pg iron per cell on average. Hydrophobic drugs were entrapped in PU NPs effectively and showed a sustained release profile. Upon heating, the release of drug was accelerated. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated a novel way to encapsulate SPIO and hydrophobic drugs in PU NPs with smart designs for potential applications in cancer diagnostics, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy. © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84899554466	Characterization of biodegradable polyurethane nanoparticles and thermally induced self-assembly in water dispersion	Waterborne polyurethanes (PU) with different compositions of biodegradable oligodiols as the soft segment were synthesized as nanoparticles (NPs) in this study. Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), multiangle light scattering (MALS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we demonstrated that these NPs were compact spheres with different shape factors. The temperature-dependent swelling of the PU NPs in water was distinct. In particular, PU NPs with 80 mol % polycaprolactone (PCL) diol and 20 mol % poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) diol as the soft segment had significant swelling (∼450%) at 37 °C. This was accompanied by a sol-gel transition observed in about 2 min for the NP dispersion. The thermally induced swelling and self-assembly of these NPs were associated with the secondary force (mainly hydrogen bonding) and degree of crystallinity, which depended on the soft segment compositions. The thermo-responsiveness of the PU NPs with mixed biodegradable oligodiols may be employed to design smart biodegradable carriers for delivery of cells or drugs near body temperature. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84901239092	Structure characterizations and protein resistance of chitosan membranes selectively crosslinked by poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate	Chitosan (CS) is a fragile material with a high modulus of elasticity. Improving its flexibility as well as membrane permeability are the key aspects that need to be addressed for using CS as a biomaterial. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) has several unique properties such as protein resistance, low toxicity, immunogenicity, and good solubility in both water and organic solvents. In this study, a vinyl compound was grafted to the C-6 position of CS by protection-grafting-deprotection. The vinyl CS was then crosslinked with PEG dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) selectively at its C-6 position to form CS-g-PEG copolymer membranes. Analyses from spectra of Fourier-transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the chemical structure of the crosslinking CS-g-PEG copolymer membranes. Thermal and mechanical properties of the prepared CS-g-PEG membranes were measured and well-correlated to their structures. The incorporation of PEGDMA into the CS increased the material's flexibility and thermal resistance. Finally, the CS-g-PEG membranes were found to have good protein resistance and blood compatibility; therefore, it has potential application as the biomedical material especially for hemodialysis. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84902082603	Regulation of human endothelial progenitor cell maturation by polyurethane nanocomposites	The mobilization and homing of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are critical to the development of an antithrombotic cardiovascular prosthesis. Polyurethane (PU) with superior elasticity may provide a mechanical environment resembling that of the natural vascular tissues. The topographical cues of PU were maximized by making nanocomposites with a small amount of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The nanocomposites of PU-AuNPs ("PU-Au") with a favorable response of endothelial cells were previously established. In the current study, the effect of PU and PU-Au nanocomposites on the behavior of human peripheral blood EPCs was investigated invitro and invivo. It was found that PU-Au promoted EPCs to become differentiated endothelial cells invitro, confirmed by the increased expressions of CD31 and VEGF-R2 surface markers. The increased maturation of EPCs was significantly more remarkable on PU-Au, probably through the stromal derived factor 1α (SDF-1α)/CXCR4 signaling pathway. Invivo experiments showed that EPCs seeded on PU-Au coated catheters effectively reduced thrombosis by differentiation into endothelial cells. Surface endothelialization with CD31 and CD34 expression as well as intimal formation with α-SMA expression was significantly accelerated in the group receiving EPC-seeded PU-Au catheters. Moreover, the analysis of collagen deposition revealed a reduction of fibrosis in the group receiving EPC-seeded PU-Au catheters as compared to the other groups. These results suggest that EPCs engineered with a proper elastic substrate may provide unique endothelialization and antithrombogenic properties that benefit vascular tissue regeneration. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84902436606	Substrate-dependent modulation of 3D spheroid morphology self-assembled in mesenchymal stem cell-endothelial progenitor cell coculture	The structural evolution of three-dimensional spheroids self-assembled from two different types of cells on selective biomaterials is demonstrated in this study. The two types of cells involved in the self-assembly are human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). When seeded in different population ratios, they can create a variety of cellular patterns on different biomaterial substrates. When the two populations are matched in initial numbers, they are self-assembled in co-spheroids with different morphologies (i.e. randomly mixed, bumped, or concentric spheroids). The morphologies are influenced by the specific cell-substrate interaction possibly through integrin signaling, as well as a substrate-dependent regulation of heterophilic cell-cell interaction possibly through Notch signaling. In particular, the self-assembled core-shell concentric spheroids from adipose-derived MSCs and EPCs show a greater angiogenic effect invitro. This study reveals the possibility to modulate the self-assembled morphology as well as the effect of cocultured cells by changing the cell culture substratum. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84903853183	Nanohybrids of silver particles on clay platelets delaminate Pseudomonas biofilms	Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of novel nanohybrids, composed of silver nanoparticles and nanoscale silicate platelets, to clear Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Materials & methods: The nanohybrids were manufactured from an in situ reduction of silver salts in the silicate platelet dispersion, and then applied to biofilms in vitro and in vivo. Results: In reference to the biocidal effects of gentamycin, the nanohybrids mitigated the spreading of the biofilms, and initiated robust cell death and exfoliation from the superficial layers of the biofilms in vitro. In vivo, the nanohybrids exhibited significant therapeutic effects by eliminating established biofilms from infected corneas and promoting the recovery of corneal integrity. Conclusion: All of the evaluations indicate the high potency of the newly developed silver nanoparticle/nanoscale silicate platelet nanohybrids for eliminating biofilms.

84904414377	Water-based synthesis and processing of novel biodegradable elastomers for medical applications	Biodegradable elastomers in the form of polyurethane nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully synthesized based on the combinations of two hydrolysis-prone polyester diols by a green water-based process. The anionic nature of the polymers successfully rendered polyurethane NPs (30-50 nm) consisting of approximately 200-300 polymer chains. The mechanical properties and degradation rate could be adjusted by the types and ratios of the component oligodiols in the soft segment. We demonstrated the feasibility using these biodegradable NPs as building blocks to generate self-assembled morphologies in nanometric, micrometric, or bulk scale, bearing excellent elasticity and biocompatibility. The elastic NPs and their various assembled forms represent a series of smart biodegradable elastomers with potential medical applications. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84905371789	The effect of elastic biodegradable polyurethane electrospun nanofibers on the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells	Biodegradable polyurethane (PU) was synthesized based on using poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) as the soft segment. Fibers in different diameters (200-400. nm, 600-800. nm, and 1.4-1.6. μm) were then made by electrospinning PU solution in N,N-dimethylacetamide and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in the form of single dispersed cells or aggregates were seeded on the electrospun meshes for evaluation of cell behavior. Differentiation experiments showed that hMSC aggregates on electrospun fibers had greater differentiation capacities than single cells. Besides, nanofibers of 200-400. nm diameters significantly promoted the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs than fibers of the other diameters. The effect of substrate elasticity was further elucidated by comparing cell behaviors on the nanofibers of PCL-based PU and those of pure PCL. The more elastic PU nanofibers demonstrated more osteogenic and chondrogenic induction potential than PCL electrospun fibers. We suggested that the elastic nanofibers seeded with hMSC aggregates may be advantageous for cartilage and bone tissue engineering. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84905472555	In vitro study of a novel nanogold-collagen composite to enhance the mesenchymal stem cell behavior for vascular regeneration	Novel nanocomposites based on type I collagen (Col) containing a small amount (17.4, 43.5, and 174 ppm) of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, approximately 5 nm) were prepared in this study. The pure Col and Col-AuNP composites (Col-Au) were characterized by the UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis), surface-enhanced raman spectroscopy (SERS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The interaction between Col and AuNPs was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectra. The effect of AuNPs on the biocompatibility of Col, evaluated by the proliferation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as well as the activation of monocytes and platelets, was investigated. Results showed that Col-Au had better biocompatibility than Col. Upon stimulation by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and stromal derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), MSCs expressed the highest levels of αvβ3 integrin/CXCR4, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) proteins when grown on the Col-Au (43.5 ppm) nanocomposite. Taken together, Col-Au nanocomposites may promote the proliferation and migration of MSCs and stimulate the endothelial cell differentiation. These results suggest that Col-Au may be used to construct tissue engineering scaffolds for vascular regeneration. © 2014 Hung et al.

84907540593	The substrate-dependent regeneration capacity of mesenchymal stem cell spheroids derived on various biomaterial surfaces	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used for their self-renewal and multipotent abilities, which can be further enhanced by growing MSCs as three-dimensional (3D) cellular spheroids on certain substrates. Although various surfaces have been used to generate 3D MSC spheroids, the answer to whether all these spheroids have similar in vitro and in vivo properties remains unclear. In this study, adipose-derived adult stem cells (ADSCs) were cultured on a non-adherent Petri dish, polyvinyl alcohol, chitosan (CS), or chitosan-hyaluronan (CS-HA) to form 3D spheroids. The expression of the cell adhesion molecule, N-cadherin, was analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The functional migration ability was tested using the transwell assay. The capacity for chondral regeneration of various ADSC spheroids was further evaluated in a rabbit model. We demonstrated that ADSC spheroids derived on the CS or CS-HA surface had the greater expression of N-cadherin and better migration ability. The latter was consistent with the higher expression levels of chemokine/receptor SDF-1/CXCR4 for the spheroids derived on CS or CS-HA. Animal studies also revealed significantly better cartilage repair in defects loaded with CS- or CS-HA-derived spheroids. In particular, CS-HA-derived spheroids gave rise to the best regeneration when combined with a 3D printed scaffold. This study suggested that MSC spheroids derived on different surfaces may have distinct in vitro and in vivo properties, which appeared to be associated with the surface-bound calcium as well as the calcium-dependent N-cadherin and CXCR4 signaling. The substrate-dependent properties may eventually lead to different regeneration capacities of various MSC spheroids in vivo. This journal is

84910625915	Efficient gene silencing in mesenchymal stem cells by substrate-mediated RNA interference	We described a novel substrate-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology to investigate the effect of neural crest marker expression on the multipotency of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs). HGFs showed significantly higher neural and chondrogenic differentiation potentials compared with adult bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth. By sending target-specific RNAi agents with the conventional vehicle (PolyFect), we observed that the multipotency of HGFs was closely associated with the expression of neural crest marker gene Forkhead box D3 (FoxD3). Using the novel chitosan substrate-mediated method, we successfully delivered short-hairpin RNA constructs to HGFs grown on chitosan without the use of conventional vehicles. The delivery efficiency measured by flow cytometry showed a 10-fold increase for HGFs on chitosan versus those on culture dish, and the cell viability was >95%. Moreover, HGFs with FoxD3 gene knockdown did not form spheroids on chitosan. Based on this working principle, we further selected the gene-silenced population from HGFs. The nonsilenced HGFs showed much higher neural differentiation ability with the nestin expression 40-fold greater than FoxD3-silenced population after induction, suggesting the feasibility of the method to silence genes. The new substrate-mediated gene silencing platform that combines the use of substrate and RNAi can be used to clarify the functions of important genes without suffering the toxicity.

84919343292	Synthesis and 3D Printing of biodegradable polyurethane elastomer by a water-based process for cartilage tissue engineering applications	Biodegradable materials that can undergo degradation in vivo are commonly employed to manufacture tissue engineering scaffolds, by techniques including the customized 3D printing. Traditional 3D printing methods involve the use of heat, toxic organic solvents, or toxic photoinitiators for fabrication of synthetic scaffolds. So far, there is no investigation on water-based 3D printing for synthetic materials. In this study, the water dispersion of elastic and biodegradable polyurethane (PU) nanoparticles is synthesized, which is further employed to fabricate scaffolds by 3D printing using polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a viscosity enhancer. The surface morphology, degradation rate, and mechanical properties of the water-based 3D-printed PU scaffolds are evaluated and compared with those of polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds made from the solution in organic solvent. These scaffolds are seeded with chondrocytes for evaluation of their potential as cartilage scaffolds. Chondrocytes in 3D-printed PU scaffolds have excellent seeding efficiency, proliferation, and matrix production. Since PU is a category of versatile materials, the aqueous 3D printing process developed in this study is a platform technology that can be used to fabricate devices for biomedical applications. Nanoelastomers in the form of biodegradable polyurethanes (PU) nanoparticles (NPs) are successfully synthesized by a water-based process. Elastic scaffolds are manufactured from the water dispersion of PU NPs by 3D printing. The green process generates a highly elastic scaffold with good cytocompatibility. The water-based 3D printing platform offers an exciting opportunity to fabricate nontoxic scaffolds for biomedical applications.

0348170745	Preparation of networks of gelatin and genipin as degradable biomaterials	The aim of this study is to prepare networks of Bloom number 300 gelatin and genipin as degradable biomaterials. The cross-linking ability of genipin on gelatin was studied and discs were made from the genipin-fixed gelatin. The swelling ratio, the degree of cross-linking, and the rate of degradation of the discs were measured using ninhydrin assay and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments. The results indicated that genipin is a good cross-linker for the gelatin. Additionally, varying the concentration of genipin can control the rate of degradation and the degree of cross-linking of the genipin-fixed gelatin. Finally, the concentration of genipin should exceed 0.5% of the overall weight of the gelatin-based material if a complete cross-linking reaction between gelatin and genipin molecules is required. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

0346786483	Improved Retention of Endothelial Cells Seeded on Polyurethane Small-diameter Vascular Grafts Modified by a Recombinant RGD-containing Protein	Sponge-type small-diameter vascular grafts were fabricated from a medical-grade polyurethane, Pellethane 2363-80A, by utilization of a salt casting technique. The grafts were compliance matched with a storage modulus of 0.53 ± 0.08 MPa. The luminal surface of grafts was modified with a thin layer (∼40 μm) of gelatin crosslinked by epoxide. Then a special Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing recombinant protein, named CBD-RGD (cellulose binding domain RGD-containing protein), was coated onto the gelatin layer. The platelet adhesion and activation on such a gelatin/CBD-RGD modified surface was significantly reduced. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were seeded more efficiently onto the modified grafts. There was also a substantial reduction in the subsequent loss of cells from the graft surface following perfusion in vitro. The cell number retained on the modified graft was enhanced by three times after 1 h of perfusion, and by eight times after 3 h of perfusion (retention rate ∼63%). The retention after 3 h of perfusion could be further increased to nearly 100% if the lined endothelium on gelatin/CBD-RGD modified graft was cultured for another week before perfusion. The modified surface was also shown to help canine external jugular vein endothelial cells to maintain the round cell morphology in vitro.

10644273645	Calvarial bone response to a tricalcium phosphate-genipin crosslinked gelatin composite	A biodegradable composite which was composed of genipin cross-linked gelatin mixing with tricalcium phosphate ceramic particles (GGT) was developed as a bone substitute. This study was evaluated by the biological response of rabbit calvarial bone to assess the potential of the GGT composite as a biodegradable and osteoconductive bone substitute. Eighteen New Zealand white rabbits were used for cranial implantation. Bone defects (15×15 mm) of nine rabbits were filled with the GGT composites, while the others were filled with the de-proteinized bovine bones as controls. Three rabbits were examined for each group in every time period at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery. The assessment included serial post-operative gross examinations, radiographic analyses and histological evaluations. This study demonstrated that this composite is: (1) malleable, with easily molded to the calvarial bone defect without fracture; (2) biocompatible, with no evidence of adverse tissue reaction; (3) osteoconductive, with progressive growth of new bone into the calvarial bone defect; (4) biodegradable, with progressive replacement of the composite by new bone. Additionally, results of both radiographic analyses and histological evaluations revealed obviously greater new bone ingrowth in the GGT composite compared with the de-proteinized bovine bone at the same implantation time. Therefore, the GGT composite could serve as a useful bone substitute for repairing bone defects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

13444252467	The effect of dynamic culture conditions on endothelial cell seeding and retention on small diameter polyurethane vascular grafts	Due to the limited number of cells available in endothelial cell (EC) seeding of small diameter vascular grafts, high seeding rate and ideal proliferation are normally required and can be achieved by optimizing the EC seeding and culture procedures. In this study, by using rotational seeding at 0.16 rpm for 12 h in an incubator, 90% cells were successfully seeded on the polyurethane vascular grafts. Following a period of 72 h of static culture, the cell retention after 6 h of flushing could reach 90%. The retention was further enhanced after perfuse culture (9 cm/s). The optimal procedures to prepare a polyurethane vascular graft (4-mm i.d., 4 cm long) populated with firmly attached EC were therefore: (1) seeding the graft with 0.5 ml of cell suspension containing ∼10
