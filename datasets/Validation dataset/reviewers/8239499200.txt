84938816422	Elucidation of arctigenin pharmacokinetics after intravenous and oral administrations in rats: Integration of in vitro and in vivo findings via semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling	Although arctigenin (AR) has attracted substantial research interests due to its promising and diverse therapeutic effects, studies regarding its biotransformation were limited. The current study aims to provide information regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of AR via various in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling. Our in vitro rat microsome incubation studies revealed that glucuronidation was the main intestinal and liver metabolic pathway of AR, which occurred with Vmax, Km, and Clint of 47.5±3.4 nmol/min/mg, 204±22 μM, and 233±9 μl/min/ mg with intestinal microsomes and 2.92±0.07 nmol/min/mg, 22.7±1.2 μM, and 129±4 μl/min/mg with liver microsomes, respectively. In addition, demethylation and hydrolysis of AR occurred with liver microsomes but not with intestinal microsomes. In vitro incubation of AR and its metabolites in intestinal content demonstrated that glucuronides of AR excreted in bile could be further hydrolyzed back to the parent compound, suggesting its potential enterohepatic circulation. Furthermore, rapid formation followed by fast elimination of arctigenic acid (AA) and arctigenin-4′-O-glucuronide (AG) was observed after both intravenous (IV) and oral administrations of AR in rats. Linear pharmacokinetics was observed at three different doses for AR, AA, and AG after IV administration of AR (0.48– 2.4 mg/kg, r2>0.99). Finally, an integrated semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic model using in vitro enzyme kinetic and in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters was successfully developed to describe plasma concentrations of AR, AA, and AG after both IV and oral administration of AR at all tested doses.

14844317357	Difference in absorption of the two structurally similar flavonoid glycosides, hyperoside and isoquercitrin, in rats	The present study was to investigate oral absorption of the two similar flavonoid glycosides, isoquercitrin (IQ, quercetin-3-O-glucoside) and hyperoside (HP, quercetin-3-O-galactoside) in rats. Two groups of male SD rats received an oral dose of either IQ (4.5 mg/kg) or HP (6.0 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected via jugular vein at time intervals after drug administration and the plasma concentrations of the studied compounds were analyzed by HPLC. The stability of IQ and HP in the GI tract was also measured by incubation with various GI contents from rats. The results showed that unchanged IQ was barely detectable whereas the glucuronidated quercetin (the aglycone of IQ) was found to be the major form in plasma after oral administration of IQ. In contrast, HP could not be detected in plasma neither as unchanged form nor its aglycone or conjugated aglycone form. Additional in vitro stability studies demonstrated that HP is more stable than IQ in the GI tract. This suggests that IQ could be hydrolyzed easier than HP to its aglycone in GI tract before being absorbed. In conclusion, IQ, as a flavonoid glucoside, could be rapidly absorbed and transformed into glucuronidated quercetin and such absorption might be related to the hydrolysis of the type of sugar moieties attached to its aglycone molecule. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

16644375017	Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of hawthorn phenolics in extract versus individual pure compound	The pharmacokinetics of an active herbal substance may be different when administered in an extract form as compared to that when administered as a pure compound. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of 4 active compounds of hawthorn fruits-namely, (-)-epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, hyperoside, and isoquercitrin-following administration of an extract formulation (as hawthorn phenolic extract, which contained the active compounds) or equivalent doses of individual pure compound in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5 per group). The hawthron phenolic extract or pure compounds were administered both orally and intravenously. Following administration, multiple plasma samples were obtained, and the plasma concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. After the intravenous injection of hawthorn phenolic extract, higher plasma drug concentration, larger area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity, longer terminal elimination half-life, smaller apparent volume of distribution, lower total body clearance, and higher urinary excretion of each compound were obtained when compared to that after the pure compound. Following the oral administration of either hawthorn phenolic extract or pure compound, only epicatechin was absorbed, and their pharmacokinetics were generally not significantly different between these 2 formulations. The differences in the pharmacokinetics of the 2 formulations following intravenous but not oral administration may be attributable to the existence of other co-occurring components in the hawthorn phonolic extract (which maybe present in the body after intravenous but not oral administration). The results showed that an herbal extract formulation, when administered intravenously, could potentially alter the pharmacokinetics of its active ingredients. ©2005 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

21244465966	Pharmacokinetics and modeling of quercetin and metabolites	Purpose. To determine the pharmacokinetics of quercetin and its glucuronide/sulfate conjugates and to develop a pharmacokinetic model to simultaneously describe their disposition after intravenous and oral administration in rats. Methods. After oral, intraportal, and intravenous administration of quercetin, serial plasma, urine, and fecal concentrations of quercetin and its conjugates were determined by an HPLC method. Enterohepatic recirculation was evaluated in a linked-rat model as well as after oral administration of bile containing quercetin and its metabolites. Based on the experimental data, a specific compartmental model was developed and validated to describe and predict the plasma concentration-time profiles of quercetin and its conjugates after oral and intravenous administration. Results. Only 5.3% of unchanged quercetin was bioavailable, although the total quercetin absorbed was as high as 59.1%. After oral administration, about 93.3% of quercetin was metabolized in the gut, with only 3.1% metabolized in the liver. No significant enterohepatic recirculation was observed for both quercetin and its conjugated metabolites. The pharmacokinetic model fitted well the observed data of quercetin and its conjugates. Conclusions. Our study clarifies the relative importance of the gut, liver, and bile in the metabolism and excretion of quercetin and its conjugates. The pharmacokinetic model appears to be suitable for describing the absorption and disposition of the quercetin and its conjugates and may be applicable to other flavonoids that undergo similar pharmacokinetic pathways. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

23744497186	Role of intestinal first-pass metabolism of baicalein in its absorption process	Purpose. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of intestinal first-pass metabolism of baicalein (B) in its absorption process. Methods. The intestinal absorption of B was characterized using Caco-2 cell monolayer model and rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model. In addition, preliminary metabolic kinetics of B was evaluated in both rat and human intestinal S9 fractions. Results. B was well absorbed and extensively metabolized to baicalin (BG), baicalein-7-O-β-glucuronide, in rat intestinal perfusion model, whereas less extent of metabolism was observed in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. Moreover, BG generated in the intestinal epithelium during the absorption of B also rapidly transported to both the apical side (the apical chamber of Caco-2 model and the perfusate of the intestinal perfusion model) as well as the basolateral side of the small intestine (the basal chamber of Caco-2 model and the mesenteric vein of the intestinal perfusion model). From the preliminary metabolic studies, it was found that a higher loading dose of B resulted in a less extent of metabolism in intestine. In addition, the extent of metabolism of B was similar in jejunum and ileum when 50 μM of B was perfused through different sections of rat small intestine. Conclusion. The first-pass metabolism of B in small intestine may play an important role in its low oral bioavailability. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

27844511101	Danshen: An overview of its chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical use	Danshen, the dried root of Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been widely used in China and, to a lesser extent, in Japan, the United States, and other European countries for the treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In China, the specific clinical use is angina pectoris, hyperlipidemia, and acute ischemic stroke. The current review covers its traditional uses, chemical constituents, pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetics, clinical applications, and potential herb-drug interactions based on information obtained in both the English and Chinese literature. Although numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that certain Danshen products in China are effective and safe for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, most of these lack sufficient quality. Therefore, large randomized clinical trials and further scientific research to determine its mechanism of actions will be necessary to ensure the safety, effectiveness, and better understanding of its action. ©2005 the American College of Clinical Pharmacology.

A simple HPLC method with photodiode-array (PDA) ultraviolet detection was developed for the simultaneous determination of three major lipophilic components (cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I and tanshinone IIA) and three major hydrophilic components (danshensu, protocatechuic aldehyde and salvianolic acid B) of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza). These six components were successfully separated using Radial-pak C18 cartridge with the elution gradient consisting of 0.5% acetic acid in water and 0.5% acetic acid in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The intra-day and inter-day precisions of the analysis were within 2.32 and 2.0%, respectively. The detection limits were 0.02, 0.01, 0.01, 0.05, 0.005 and 0.02 μg/ml for cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, danshensu, protocatechuic aldehyde and salvianolic acid B, respectively. The developed method has been applied to the simultaneous determination of above six major components in Fufang Danshen Tablet and Dripping Pill products by extraction with methanol and water. It has been demonstrated that salvianolic acid B and danshensu are the major components among the eight commercial Fufang Danshen products studied. The current developed method with methanol as extraction solvent provides a simple and efficient method for simultaneous detection of both lipophilic and hydrophilic major components in Danshen products. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

33744534785	Position preference on glucuronidation of mono-hydroxylflavones in human intestine	Extensive intestinal glucuronidation has been previously reported in both human and animals after oral administration of naturally occurred flavonoids. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between human intestinal glucuronidation activity and the position of hydroxyl substitution on flavonoids. Seven commercially available mono-hydroxyflavones (HF), namely 3-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 2′-, 3′- and 4′-mono-hydroxyflavones, were chosen as model compounds. Glucuronidation activity of the selected seven HFs was investigated by incubating each HF at various concentrations with human jejunum S9 at 37 °C for 10 min.

33845424456	Involvement of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in the extensive liver and intestinal first-pass metabolism of flavonoid baicalein	Purpose. The present study aims to investigate the involvement of UDP-glucuronosyltranferase (UGT) in the extensive liver and intestinal first-pass glucuronidation of baicalein (B) in both rats and humans and also to study sulfation and P450 mediated hydroxylation of B. Materials and Methods. B was incubated with liver and intestine microsome, cytosol, S9 fractions from human, rat and various human recombinant UGT isozymes, respectively. The generated metabolites were identified by HPLC/MS/MS and quantified by HPLC/UV. Results. Three metabolites of B namely baicalein 7-O-glucuronide (BG), the isomer of baicalein 7-O-glucuronide (BG'), and baicalein sulfate were found. BG, the predominant metabolite of B, was extensively generated in liver and jejunum microsomes in both humans and rats. Its formation was mainly catalyzed by UGT 1A9 and also mediated by UGT 1A1, 1A3, 1A8, 1A7 and 2B15 with different kinetic profiles. UGT 1A8 mediated formation of BG' was mainly found in human intestine and rat liver microsomes. Sulfation and P450 mediated hydroxylation of B were much less significant than glucuronidation. Conclusions. Extensive liver and intestinal first-pass glucuronidation of B were found in both humans and rats. Under the current experimental conditions, UGT 1A9 and UGT 1A8 demonstrated the fastest formation rate of BG in human liver preparations and BG' in human intestine preparations, respectively. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

33847360957	Rapid determination of six metabolites from multiple cytochrome P450 probe substrates in human liver microsome by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry: Application to high-throughput inhibition screening of terpenoids	A rapid liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of six cytochrome P450 (CYP) probe substrate metabolites including paracetamol (PAR) for CYP1A2, 4-hydroxytolbutamide (OHTOL) for CYP2C9, 5-hydroxyomeprazole (OHOMe) for CYP2C19, dextrorphan (DEXM) for CYP2D6, 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone (OHCHL) for CYP2E1 and dehydronifedipine (DNIF) for CYP3A4. The triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative modes, and selective reaction monitoring was used for quantification. The method was validated over the concentration ranges (0.075/0.04/0.05/0.02/0.1/0.0625 μM to 4.8/2.56/3.2/1.28/6.4/4.0 μM) for PAR/OHTOL/OHOME/DEXP/OHCHL/DNIF analytes with acceptable accuracy and precision. The inhibitory effect on the six CYP enzymes has been verified with their known specific inhibitors. This high-throughput inhibition screening approach has been successfully applied to study the inhibitory effects of 18 terpenoids on CYP enzymes. Among them, tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone are found to be potent inhibitors to CYP1A2, while artemisinin is a marginal inhibitor to CYP1A2 and glycyrrhetic acid is a weak inhibitor to CYP2C9.

This study was undertaken to determine the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms. (SNPs) and haplotypes and to detect yet unknown SNPs in the NR1I2 gene in 210 unrelated healthy Han Chinese in comparison with other ethnic groups. We also characterized the functional impact of two SNPs, -24622A>T in the 5′-untranslated region and -24446C>A in exon 1 of NR1I2, by constructing three recombinants and monitoring promoter activity using the dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral leukocytes and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, followed by direct DNA sequencing: Sixteen SNPs in NR1I2 with frequencies of 0.3-90.3% were found in Han Chinese, two of which (-25439A>G in the 5′-untranslated region and 7637C>T in intron 5) are previously unknown. The mutant allelic frequencies varied from 0.3% to 90.3%. Most of the detected SNPs were located in introns.

37549066909	Intestinal and hepatic glucuronidation of flavonoids	Flavonoids are polyphenolic phytochemicals present extensively in our daily diets, beverages, medicinal plants, and herbal remedies. The diverse biological effects of flavonoids have aroused great interest in scientists. In the past decade, various studies demonstrated extensive conjugate metabolisms, especially glucuronidation, of flavonoids in intestine and liver implying an important role of the glucuronidation in causing low oral bioavailability of flavonoids. The present article aims to review the up-to-date information on the studies of the first-pass metabolism, in particular glucuronidation, of flavonoids in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and also the isoformic enzymes involved in the metabolism and disposition of flavonoids. In addition, the role of efflux transporters, enterohepatic circulation, and enteric cycling in the disposition of flavonoid glucuronides has also been illustrated. Despite low oral bioavailabilities of the parent compounds, flavonoids and some of their bioactive phase II conjugates may accumulate adequate amount in the body to produce their pharmacological activities. Further investigation on the correlation between the accumulated concentrations of flavonoids and their pharmacological activities after their repeated oral administration is warranted. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

38149068306	Preclinical factors affecting the pharmacokinetic behaviour of tanshinone IIA, an investigational new drug isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza for the treatment of ischaemic heart diseases	Tanshinone IIA (TSIIA) is a major active triterpenoid isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza. The purposes of this study were to investigate various preclinical factors that determined the pharmacokinetics of TSIIA. After oral dosing at 6.7, 20, and 60 mg kg-1, TSIIA was detected mainly as glucuronidated conjugate (TSIIAG) with only small amounts of the unchanged in the plasma. TSIIA was predominantly excreted into the bile and faeces as TSIIAG, and urine to a minor extent. The Cmax and AUC0-t of TSIIAG after i.p. administration were significantly lower than those after intragastric administration. The plasma concentration-time profiles of TSIIA following oral dosing of TSIIA showed multiple peaks. The Cmax and AUC0-t of TSIIA and its glucuronides in rats with intact bile duct were significantly lower than those of rats with bile duct cannulation. Studies from the linked-rat model and intraduodenal injection of bile containing TSIIA and its metabolites indicate that TSIIA glucuronides underwent hydrolysis and the aglycone was reabsorbed from the gut and excreted into the bile as conjugates. TSIIA had a wide tissue distribution, with a very high accumulation in the lung, but very limited penetration into the brain and testes. TSIIA was metabolized by rat CYP2C, 3A and 2D, as ticlopidine, ketoconazole and quinidine all inhibited TSIIA metabolism in rat liver microsomes. Taken collectively, these findings indicate that multiple factors play important roles in determining the pharmacokinetics of TSIIA. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

34249297623	Mechanistic study on the intestinal absorption and disposition of baicalein	The present study aims to investigate the mechanisms of intestinal absorption and disposition of flavonoid baicalein (B) in Caco-2 cell monolayer model, transporter overexpressing membrane, and cellular models. The bidirectional transport studies of B and its metabolite baicalein-7-glucuronide (BG) were conducted at various concentrations and in the absence or presence of the selected transporter inhibitors. To identify specific interactions of BG with ABC transporters, ABC transporter-ATPase assays were carried out on membrane vesicles prepared from Sf9 cells overexpressing human MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, MRP3 and MXR. To further confirm the interactions between BG and specific ABC transporters, inhibition of BG on the transport of substrates of specific transporters were evaluated using membrane vesicles overexpressing MRP1-3 and MXR, or K562MDR cells with overexpressing MDR1. The results showed that B could readily pass through Caco-2 cell monolayer, but with significant glucuronidation and sulfation. The extent of phase II metabolism of B during its transport was in dose-dependent manner. The intracellularly formed glucuronide and sulfate of B were efficiently extruded to both apical and basolateral sides of the Caco-2 monolayer, which were reduced in the presence of MRP inhibitors. Although BG was not permeable from apical to basolateral side, it exhibited significant efflux transport that was inhibited in the presence of MRPs inhibitors. Moreover, BG seemed to activate the ATPase activity of both MRP3 and MXR at a pharmacologically relevant concentration range. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

40749148985	Pharmacokinetic characterization of hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin- included complex of cryptotanshinone, an investigational cardiovascular drug purified from Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza)	1. The study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cryptotanshinone in a hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin-included complex in dogs and rats. 2. Animals were administrated the inclusion complex of cryptotanshinone and the concentrations of cryptotanshinone and its major metabolite tanshinone IIA were determined by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. 3. Cryptotanshinone in inclusion complex was absorbed slowly after an oral dose, and the Cmax and AUC0-t were dose-proportional. The bioavailability of cryptotanshinone in rats was (6.9% ± 1.9%) at 60 mg kg-1and (11.1% ± 1.8%) in dogs at 53.4 mg kg-1. The t1/2 of the compound in rats and dogs was 5.3-7.4 and 6.0-10.0 h, respectively. Cryptotanshinone showed a high accumulation in the intestine, lung and liver after oral administration, while the lung, liver and heart had the highest level following intravenous dose. Excretion data in rats showed that cryptotanshinone and its metabolites were mainly eliminated from faeces and bile, and the dose recovery rate was 0.02, 2.2, and 14.9% in urine, bile, and faeces, respectively. 4. The disposition of cryptotanshinone in an inclusion complex was dose-independent and the bioavailability was increased compared with that without cyclodextrin used to formulate the drug. Cryptotanshinone was distributed extensively into different organs. Excretion of cryptotanshinone and its metabolites into urine was extremely low, and they were mainly excreted into faeces and bile. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.

A closely related arylation reaction was also discovered during the methodology development. By simply switching the reaction medium, high phosphonylation/arylation ratios and vice versa can be achieved. This may not be a direct result of changing solvent polarity. The allyl diarylphosphonates were evaluated as carboxylesterase inhibitors, and the screening results revealed that the inhibitory efficiency is highly related to the choice of alkenes and aryl substituents. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2010.

79951581524	A bio-activity guided in vitro pharmacokinetic method to improve the quality control of Chinese medicines, application to Si Wu Tang	The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using a bio-activity guided in vitro pharmacokinetic (BAPK) method in identifying relevant (absorbable and bioactive) markers for quality control (QC) of Chinese medicines (CM), using Si Wu Tang (SWT), a popular CM for women's health, as an example. A stepwise BAPK approach was utilized for relevant marker determination and evaluating of six SWT products: (1) data mining to identify active components of SWT, (2) quantification of the identified active components in each SWT product, (3) determination of in vitro dissolution and metabolism of the components under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, (4) identification of absorbable components or marker(s) via in vitro Caco-2 cell model, (5) stability testing of the permeable marker(s). Our results showed considerable variations in the amount of active components in different SWT products. Of the nine active components identified from data mining, three (ferulic acid, ligustilide, senkyunolide A) were found to be well permeated and stable over three months. Paeoniflorin, the marker designated by Chinese Pharmacopoeia, was poorly permeable and thus could not be considered a relevant marker for SWT. Our preliminary evaluation of the BAPK method appears to be feasible and may offer as a useful approach for identifying relevant markers of other TCM products in the future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80052584684	Hepatic metabolism and disposition of baicalein via the coupling of conjugation enzymes and transporters-in vitro and in vivo evidences	Baicalein (Ba) was found to be subject to serious first-pass metabolism after oral administration. We previously revealed the important role of intestine in the low oral bioavailability of Ba. The present study aims to evaluate the hepatic metabolism and disposition of Ba. Ba was given to Sprague-Dawley rats through bolus or infusion via intravenous or intra-portal route of administrations. Both plasma and bile samples at different time intervals were obtained. Concentrations of Ba and potential metabolites in the collected samples were analyzed with HPLC/UV and identified by LC/MS/MS, respectively. Plasma concentration versus time profiles of Ba obtained from intravenous and intra-portal administrations were compared to estimate the extent of hepatic metabolism. In addition, transport studies of baicalein-7-glucuronide (BG), one of the major metabolites of Ba, were carried out using transfected cell systems overexpressing various human organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) isoforms to estimate the specific transporters involved in the hepatic disposition of Ba metabolites. The results showed that liver, in addition to intestine, also conferred extensive metabolism to Ba. Several mono- and di-conjugates of Ba, which were mainly glucuronides, sulfates, and methylates, were found in bile. The transport study demonstrated that besides MRPs and BCRP, human OATP2B1 and OATP1B3 in liver might also mediate the secretion of BG to bile. In summary, liver plays an important role in the metabolism of Ba and transport of its conjugated metabolites. © 2011 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

84877270519	Establishing the pharmaceutical quality of Chinese herbal medicine: A provisional BCS classification	The Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), which is a scientific approach to categorize active drug ingredient based on its solubility and intestinal permeability into one of the four classes, has been used to set the pharmaceutical quality standards for drug products in western society. However, it has received little attention in the area of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM). This is likely, in part, due to the presence of multiple active components as well as lack of standardization of CHM. In this report, we apply BCS classification to CHMs provisionally as a basis for establishing improved in vitro quality standards. Based on a top-200 drugs selling list in China, a total of 31 CHM products comprising 50 official active marker compounds (AMCs) were provisionally classified according to BCS. Information on AMC content and doses of these CHM products were retrieved from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. BCS parameters including solubility and permeability of the AMCs were predicted in silico (ACD/Laboratories). A BCS classification of CHMs according to biopharmaceutical properties of their AMCs is demonstrated to be feasible in the current study and can be used to provide a minimum set of quality standards. Our provisional results showed that 44% of the included AMCs were classified as Class III (high solubility, low permeability), followed by Class II (26%), Class I (18%), and Class IV (12%). A similar trend was observed when CHMs were classified in accordance with the BCS class of AMCs. Most (45%) of the included CHMs were classified as Class III, followed by Class II (16%), Class I (10%), and Class IV (6%); whereas 23% of the CHMs were of mixed class due to the presence of multiple individual AMCs with different BCS classifications. Moreover, about 60% of the AMCs were classified as high-solubility compounds (Class I and Class III), suggesting an important role for an in vitro dissolution test in setting quality control standards ensuring consistent biopharmaceutical quality for the commercially available CHM products. That is, provisionally, more than half of the AMCs of the top-selling CHMs included in this study would be candidates for a bioequivalence (BE) biowaiver, based on WHO recommendations and EMEA guidelines. Thus a dissolution requirement on these AMCs would represent a significant advance in the pharmaceutical quality of CHM today. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

It is unclear if higher-dose oseltamivir provides benefit beyond the standard dose in influenza patients who require hospitalization. Methods. A prospective intervention study was performed in 2 acute care general hospitals in Hong Kong over 4 seasonal peaks (2010-2012). Adults (≥18 years) with laboratory-confirmed influenza (85 A/H3N2, 34 A/H1N1pdm09, 36 B) infections who presented within 96 hours were recruited. Study regimen of either 150 mg or 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily for 5 days was allocated by site, which was switched after 2 seasons. Subjects with preexisting renal impairment (creatinine clearance, 40-60 mL/minute) received 75 mg oseltamivir twice daily. Viral clearance by day 5 and clinical responses were compared between groups. Plasma steady-state trough oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results. Altogether, 41 and 114 patients received 150 mg and 75 mg twice-daily oseltamivir, respectively; their enrollment characteristics (mean age, 61 ± 18 vs 66 ± 16 years) and illness severity were comparable. Trough OC levels were higher in the 150-mg group (501.0 ± 237.0 vs 342.6 ± 192.7 ng/mL). There were no significant differences in day 5 viral RNA (44.7% vs 40.2%) or culture negativity (100.0% vs 98.1%), RNA decline rate, and durations of fever, oxygen supplementation, and hospitalization. Results were similar when analyzed by study arm (all cases and among those without renal impairment). Subanalysis of influenza B patients showed faster RNA decline rate (analysis of variance, F = 4.14; P = .05) and clearance (day 5, 80.0% vs 57.1%) with higher-dose treatment. No oseltamivir resistance was found. Treatments were generally well tolerated. Conclusions. We found no additional benefit of higher-dose oseltamivir treatment in adults hospitalized with influenza A, but an improved virologic response in influenza B. © The Author 2013.

84897535256	Updates on the clinical evidenced herb-warfarin interactions	Increasing and inadvertent use of herbs makes herb-drug interactions a focus of research. Concomitant use of warfarin, a highly efficacious oral anticoagulant, and herbs causes major safety concerns due to the narrow therapeutic window of warfarin. This paper presents an update overview of clinical findings regarding herb-warfarin interaction, highlighting clinical outcomes, severity of documented interactions, and quality of clinical evidence. Among thirty-eight herbs, Cannabis, Chamomile, Cranberry, Garlic, Ginkgo, Grapefruit, Lycium, Red clover, and St. John's wort were evaluated to have major severity interaction with warfarin. Herbs were also classified on account of the likelihood of their supporting evidences for interaction. Four herbs were considered as highly probable to interact with warfarin (level I), three were estimated as probable (level II), and ten and twenty-one were possible (level III) and doubtful (level IV), respectively. The general mechanism of herb-warfarin interaction almost remains unknown, yet several pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors were estimated to influence the effectiveness of warfarin. Based on limited literature and information reported, we identified corresponding mechanisms of interactions for a small amount of "interacting herbs." In summary, herb-warfarin interaction, especially the clinical effects of herbs on warfarin therapy should be further investigated through multicenter studies with larger sample sizes. © 2014 Beikang Ge et al.

84898769262	Species difference in the inhibitory potentials of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the hepatic sulfation and glucuronidation of bioactive flavonoids: Differential observations among common inhibition parameters	1.This study elucidated the species differences between rats and humans in the inhibitory potential of drugs against sulfation and glucuronidation, and whether such differences depend on the inhibition parameter adopted. 2.With 14 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as model inhibitors and three flavanoids baicalein, wogonin and oroxylin A as model substrates, three common inhibition parameters percentage of control, IC50 and Ki were determined in rat liver cytosols (RLCs), human liver cytosols (HLCs), rat liver microsomes (RLMs) and human liver microsomes (HLMs). The closeness of the inhibition parameters from rat liver preparations to that from human liver preparations was analyzed by geometric mean fold error (GMFE) and statistical comparisons. 3.The percentage of control in RLC/RLM was not significantly different from that in HLC/HLM, with a GMFE of 0.85 (RLC-HLC) and 1.03 (RLM-HLM); whereas the IC50 and Ki in RLC/RLM were significantly different from that in HLC/HLM. The trend of difference was consistent between IC50 and Ki, where these parameters in RLC and RLM underestimated (GMFE <0.5) and overestimated (GMFE >2) that in HLC and HLM, respectively. 4.In conclusion, the inhibitory potentials of NSAIDs against sulfation and glucuronidation in rats and humans were different and depended on the adopted inhibition parameters. © 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

84908584201	Synthesis, biological activity, and biopharmaceutical characterization of tacrine dimers as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors	Tacrine (THA), as the first approved acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been extensively investigated in last seven decades. After dimerization of THA via a 7-carbon alkyl spacer, bis(7)-tacrine (B7T) showed much potent anti-AChE activity than THA. We here report synthesis, biological evaluation and biopharmaceutical characterization of six THA dimers referable to B7T. According to IC<inf>50</inf> values, the in vitro anti-AChE activities of THA dimers were up to 300-fold more potent and 200-fold more selective than that of THA. In addition, the anti-AChE activities of THA dimers were found to be associated with the type and length of the linkage. All studied THA dimers showed much lower cytotoxicity than B7T, but like B7T, they demonstrated much lower absorptive permeabilities than that of THA on Caco-2 monolayer model. In addition, all THA dimers demonstrated significant efflux transport (efflux ratio >4), indicating that the limited permeability could be associated with the efflux transport during absorption process. Moreover, the dimer with higher Log P value was accompanied with higher permeability but lower aqueous solubility. A balanced consideration of activity, solubility, cytotoxicity and permeability should be conducted in selection of the potential candidates for further in vivo investigation.

43049156565	Preclinical characterization of intestinal absorption and metabolism of promising anti-Alzheimer's dimer bis(7)-tacrine	The present study aims to investigate the preclinical intestinal absorption of bis(7)-tacrine (B7T) using different absorption models. In addition, potential intestinal and liver first-pass metabolism was evaluated by in vitro incubation of B7T with rat intestine and liver microsome. Results showed that the permeability of B7T across artificial membrane was pH dependent with rapid diffusion achieved at both pH 6.8 and 7.4. However, the absorptive permeability of B7T in Caco-2 cell model was substantially lower than that in the artificial membrane accompanied with over 56% of B7T being trapped within Caco-2 cells. In the rat in situ intestinal perfusion model, B7T was subject to an extensive intestinal extraction (>90%) with extremely low concentration of B7T detected in mesenteric blood, which was further found to be associated with the high tissue binding (99.9%) of B7T. In vitro incubation of B7T with rat liver and intestinal microsomes revealed that hydroxylation of B7T might mainly occur in rat liver rather than intestine. In conclusion, B7T is expected to have a low oral bioavailability in vivo, which may be due to its poor intestinal permeability, significant tissue binding and hepatic hydroxylation metabolism. © 2008.

57849152871	Intestinal first-pass glucuronidation activities of selected dihydroxyflavones	Flavonoids have low bioavailabilities due to extensive intestinal first-pass metabolisms, especially glucuronidation. The present study aimed to evaluate the intestinal glucuronidation of dihydroxyflavones and provide more information on their structure-activity relationships. Seven dihydroxyflavones, namely 3,7-, 5,7-, 6,7-, 7,8-, 2′,7-, 3′,7-, and 4′,7-dihydroxyflaovne and a monohydroxyflavone, 7-hydroxyflavone, were investigated by incubating each hydroxyflavone at various concentrations with either human jejunum microsome or rat intestinal microsome. Two mono-glucuronides were identified for each dihydroxyflavone. For human jejunum microsome, most of the studied dihydroxyflavones demonstrated greater glucuronidation activities than that of 7-hydroxyflavone except for 3,7-dihydroxyflavone and 4′,7-dihydroxyflavone. 3′,7-dihydroxyflavone had the greatest intrinsic clearance which was at least seven times greater than that of all other dihydroxyflavones. In addition, species difference in glucuronidation activity was observed with human jejunum microsome higher than rat intestinal microsome for all hydroxyflavones except for 3,7-dihydroxyflavone. The results further demonstrated that the hydroxyl group positions do affect the intestinal glucuronidation activity of hydroxyflavones. Increasing the number of hydroxyl groups on A- or B-ring (except for 4′-OH) would enhance the glucuronidation activity of flavones, whereas adding a 3-OH on C-ring might not. Furthermore, existence of hydroxyl group at 3′ position may enhance the glucuronidation activity of flavonoids. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

67349223507	Simultaneous quantification of active components in the herbs and products of Si-Wu-Tang by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry	Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), comprising Paeoniae, Angelicae, Chuanxiong and Rehmanniae, is one of the most popular Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulae for woman's health. Data mining from the available Chinese and English literatures indicated that the major bioactive components of SWT consist of paeoniflorin, paeonol, gallic acid, ferulic acid, Z-ligustilide, ligustrazine, butylphthalide, senkyunolide A and catalpol. Since content determination of the marker compounds is generally considered as an initial step for quality control of TCM product, a high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric method employing both positive and negative electrospray ionization was developed for the simultaneous determination of the nine identified compounds in the raw herbs and products of SWT. The LOQ of the developed assay method for the tested components was 10 ng/ml for ligustrazine, 200 ng/ml for catalpol, and 100 ng/ml for the other seven compounds. The intra-day and inter-day variations of the current assay were within 17.5%. Paeoniflorin, ferulic acid, gallic acid, Z-ligustilide and senkyunolide A were found in all SWT products investigated. Variations in the contents of the studied compounds were observed among batches of raw herbs and SWT products. The currently developed method provides a sensitive and rapid quantification approach that can be useful in the quality control of raw herbs and products of SWT. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

68749116199	Effect of sodium caprate on the oral absorptions of danshensu and salvianolic acid B	The current study aims to investigate the effect of sodium caprate on the intestinal absorption and bioavailabilities of danshensu and salvianolic acid B, the major active components in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge (Danshen). Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics properties of the two compounds have been characterized by in vitro, in situ models as well as in vivo in rats. Based on the identified biopharmaceutics characteristics of the two compounds, effect of sodium carparate as absorption enhancer on the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of danshensu and salvianolic acid B in pure compound form as well as extract form were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Both danshensu and salvianolic acid B demonstrated very limited intestinal permeabilities, leading to oral bioavailabilities of only 11.09% and 3.90% in rats, respectively. Results from both in vitro and in vivo studies consistently indicated that sodium caprate could significantly enhance intestinal permeabilities as well as the in vivo bioavailabilities of both danshensu and salvianolic acid B. The current findings not only identified the usefulness of sodium caprate for the improved delivery of Danshen product but also demonstrated the importance of biopharmaceutics characterization in the dosage form development of traditional Chinese medicine. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

All three alkaloids exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects on citric acid-induced cough in guinea pigs after intraperitoneal administration. Alkaloid 2 had the same potency via both oral and intraperitoneal dosing, 1 exhibited significantly lower oral activity than that following intraperitoneal application, while 3 did not show oral activity. Alkaloid 4 demonstrated a moderate permeability in Caco-2 monolayer cells while alkaloids 1, 2 and 3 exhibited relatively higher intestinal permeabilities, indicating that all four alkaloids tested had reasonable oral absorption. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

70349512947	Studies on the influence of esterase inhibitor to the pharmacokinetic profiles of oseltamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate in rats using an improved LC/MS/MS method	Oseltamivir (O), an ethyl ester prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is currently the drug of choice for avian influenza. Previous studies have found that the addition of esterase inhibitor can inhibit the metabolism of O to OC in plasma samples. The current study aims to evaluate the impact of dichlorvos on the rat plasma concentrations of O and OC and subsequent effect on their pharmacokinetics. The plasma samples of rats after oral administration of O were divided into two equal portions for treatment with/without dichlorvos. O and OC plasma concentrations were analyzed by a sensitive and specific LC/MS/MS method, using cephalexin as internal standard for both two analytes. The samples were extracted with an MCX cartridge and separated on a Nova-Pak CN HP column eluted with a mobile phase of 0.15% formic acid in 50% methanol.

Following solid phase extraction with HLB cartridge, the analytes were separated using a gradient mobile phase consisting of methanol-acetonitrile-phosphate buffer. The flow-rate was set at 1 ml/min and the eluent was detected at 320 nm. The method is linear over the studied range of 1-10 and 0.05-1 μg/ml for baicalein and baicalin, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day variations of the analysis were less than 6.38%, with relative error ranging from -3.6 to 6%. The limit of quantification in plasma was 0.05 μg/ml for both baicalein and baicalin. The developed method proves to be an improved and more reliable method because of its capability for determining baicalein and baicalin simultaneously in a single chromatographic run. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

77349092774	Simultaneous measurement of S-warfarin, R-warfarin, S-7-hydroxywarfarin and R-7-hydroxywarfarin in human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry	Clinically used anticoagulant warfarin is usually available as a racemic mixture of S- and R-warfarin that are both metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Determination of warfarin enantiomers and their enantiomeric 7-hydroxywarfarin (7-OH-warfarin) metabolites in the human plasma sample allows probing of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme activities and detection of ingestion of warfarin-containing products for the investigation of unexplained bleeding. The present study aims to develop a sensitive and specific liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous detection of S-warfarin, R-warfarin, S-7-OH-warfarin and R-7-OH-warfarin in human plasma. Plasma samples were extracted with mixed-mode cation-exchange (MCX) cartridge with recoveries of greater than 87.0% for all four analytes. The selectivity of 7-OH-warfarin from other monohydroxylated warfarin metabolites such as 4′-, 6-, 8- and 10-hydroxywarfarins using a Chirobiotic V chiral column and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was addressed. The developed LC-MS/MS method is simple, specific and has been fully validated with satisfactory accuracy and adequate reproducibility with limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5. ng/ml for all four analytes. The method was successfully applied to analyze the steady state plasma concentrations of the four analytes in 30 patients. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although it is generally perceived that the nasal route could avoid the first-pass metabolism in liver and gastrointestinal tract, the role of metabolic conversions in systemic and brain-targeted deliveries of the parent compounds and their metabolites should not be underestimated. In this commentary, metabolite formations after intranasal and other routes of administration are compared. Also, the disposition of metabolites in plasma and brain after nasal administrations of parent drugs, prodrugs and preformed metabolites will be discussed.

77953020053	In vitro concentration dependent transport of phenytoin and phenobarbital, but not ethosuximide, by human P-glycoprotein	Aims: One possible mechanism for epilepsy drug resistance is overexpression of P-glycoprotein in the blood-brain barrier, but whether (or which) antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are transported by P-gp remains unclear. We evaluated AEDs as P-gp substrates using cell monolayers. Main methods: Bi-directional transport assays and concentration equilibrium transport assays (CETAs) were performed for phenytoin (PHT), phenobarbital (PB), and ethosuximide (ESM) using wildtype Madin-Darby Canine Kidney II cell line MDCKII and porcine renal endothelial cell line LLC-PK1 cells and these cells transfected with human MDR1 cDNA to express P-gp. Key findings: Wildtype cells demonstrated no efflux transport of PHT, PB, or ESM. In CETAs, both MDR1-transfected cell lines transported PHT from basolateral to apical when PHT loading concentrations were 5 or 10, but not 20μg/ml. MDCK-MDR1 cells transported PB when initial concentrations were 10 or 20, but not 5μg/ml. LLC-MDR1 did not transport PB. P-gp inhibitor verapamil blocked efflux transport. MDR1-transfected cells did not transport ESM at 5.6 or 56μg/ml. Bi-directional transport assays demonstrated weak transport for PHT but not PB or ESM. Significance: Human P-gp transports PHT and PB, but not ESM, in a concentration dependent manner. CETA may be more sensitive than bi-directional assays to detect transport of drugs with high passive diffusion. Potential P-gp substrates should be tested at clinically relevant concentration ranges. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In the current study, levels of the adenosine phosphates including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) in gastrocnemius at various postmortem intervals of 180 rats from different death modes were detected by high performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that the levels of ATP and ADP significantly decreased along with the postmortem period of rats from different death mode whereas the AMP level remained the same. In addition, it was found that changes in the ATP levels in muscles after death correlated well with the development of rigor mortis. Therefore, the ATP level could serve as a reference parameter for the deduction of rigor mortis in forensic science. © 2010 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.

79953158644	Discovery of molecular mechanisms of traditional Chinese medicinal formula Si-Wu-Tang using gene expression Microarray and Connectivity Map	To pursue a systematic approach to discovery of mechanisms of action of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), we used microarrays, bioinformatics and the "Connectivity Map" (CMAP) to examine TCM-induced changes in gene expression. We demonstrated that this approach can be used to elucidate new molecular targets using a model TCM herbal formula Si-Wu-Tang (SWT) which is widely used for women's health. The human breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with 0.1 μM estradiol or 2.56 mg/ml of SWT showed dramatic gene expression changes, while no significant change was detected for ferulic acid, a known bioactive compound of SWT. Pathway analysis using differentially expressed genes related to the treatment effect identified that expression of genes in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) cytoprotective pathway was most significantly affected by SWT, but not by estradiol or ferulic acid. The Nrf2-regulated genes HMOX1, GCLC, GCLM, SLC7A11 and NQO1 were upreguated by SWT in a dose-dependent manner, which was validated by real-time RT-PCR. Consistently, treatment with SWT and its four herbal ingredients resulted in an increased antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity in MCF-7 and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the gene expression profile of differentially expressed genes related to SWT treatment was used to compare with those of 1,309 compounds in the CMAP database. The CMAP profiles of estradiol-treated MCF-7 cells showed an excellent match with SWT treatment, consistent with SWT's widely claimed use for women's diseases and indicating a phytoestrogenic effect. The CMAP profiles of chemopreventive agents withaferin A and resveratrol also showed high similarity to the profiles of SWT. This study identified SWT as an Nrf2 activator and phytoestrogen, suggesting its use as a nontoxic chemopreventive agent, and demonstrated the feasibility of combining microarray gene expression profiling with CMAP mining to discover mechanisms of actions and to identify new health benefits of TCMs.

80053566885	In vitro transport profile of carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, and their active metabolites by human P-glycoprotein	Purpose: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are widely used not only in the treatment of epilepsy but also as treatments for psychiatric disorders. Pharmacoresistance of AEDs in the treatment of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders is a serious problem. Transport of antiepileptic drugs by P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1, or MDR1), which is overexpressed in the blood-brain barrier, may be a mechanism for resistance of AEDs. For most AEDs, conflicting evidence precludes consensus on whether they are substrates of Pgp. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether analogs and metabolites of the AED carbamazepine are substrates of human Pgp. Methods: Polarized cell lines MDCKII and LLC transfected with the human MDR1 gene were used in the bidirectional transport assay and concentration equilibrium transport assay. The expression of Pgp was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunofluorescent staining. Rhodamine-123 uptake was also determined. Key Findings: Pgp did not transport carbamazepine, but it did transport its active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide. Pgp also pumped eslicarbazepine acetate and oxcarbazepine, as well as their active metabolite (S)-licarbazepine. Transport of the drugs was in the order of ESL>OXC>S-LC>CBZ-E in concentration equilibrium conditions. The transport of these drugs was blocked by Pgp inhibitors tariquidar and verapamil. Significance: All carbamazepine analogs or metabolites tested are Pgp substrates, except for carbamazepine. These data suggest that resistance to carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or eslicarbazepine acetate may be attributed to increased efflux function of Pgp because they or their active metabolites are Pgp substrates. © 2011 International League Against Epilepsy.

80054705192	An approach for rapid development of nasal delivery of analgesics - Identification of relevant features, in vitro screening and in vivo verification	Drug delivery via the nasal route is gaining increasing interest over the last two decades as an alternative to oral or parenteral drug administration. In the current study an approach for rapid identification of relevant features, screening and in vivo verification of potential therapeutic agents for nasal delivery was carried out using "analgesic agents" as an example. Four such drug candidates (rizatriptan, meloxicam, lornoxicam and nebivolol) were initially identified as potentially viable agents based on their therapeutic use and physicochemical characteristics. An in vitro screening was then carried out using the Calu-3 cell line model. Based on the in vitro screening results and the reported pharmacokinetic and the stability data, meloxicam was predicted to be the most promising drug candidate and was subsequently verified using an in vivo animal model.

80255134557	Investigation of the disposition of loxapine, amoxapine and their hydroxylated metabolites in different brain regions, CSF and plasma of rat by LC-MS/MS	Loxapine represents an interesting example of old "new" drug and is recently drawing attention for its novel inhalation formulation for the treatment of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders. It is extensively metabolized to several active metabolites with diverging pharmacological properties. To further pursue the contribution of metabolites to the overall outcome after loxapine administration, quantification of both loxapine and its active metabolites is essential. The current study developed a rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of loxapine and its five metabolites (amoxapine, 7-hydroxy-loxapine, 8-hydroxy-loxapine, 7-hydroxy-amoxapine and 8-hydroxy-amoxapine) in rat brain tissues, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By evaluating the effects of perchloric acid and methanol on analyte recovery, the extraction methods were optimized and only small amounts of sample (100. μl for plasma and less than 100. mg for brain tissue) were required. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) in brain tissue were 3. ng/g for loxapine and amoxapine and 5. ng/g for the four hydroxylated metabolites of loxapine. The LLOQs were 1. ng/ml for loxapine and amoxapine and 2. ng/ml for the four hydroxylated metabolites in plasma, and 10. ng/ml for all analytes in CSF. The developed method was applied to a pharmacokinetic study on rats treated with a low-dose loxapine by oral administration. Four hours after loxapine dosing, high levels of 7-hydroxy-loxapine were found throughout the ten brain regions examined (68-124. ng/g), while only trace amount of loxapine was measured in brain (<5. ng/g) and plasma (<3. ng/ml). The method provides a useful tool for both preclinical and clinical investigations on the dispositions of loxapine and its metabolites, which would help to elucidate their roles in neurotherapeutics. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80054884803	Pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics properties of Radix Scutellariae and its bioactive flavones	Radix Scutellariae is the dried root of the medicinal plant Scutellariae baicalensis Georgi. It exhibits a variety of therapeutic effects and has a long history of application in traditional formulations as well as in modern herbal medications. It has been confirmed that flavonoids are the most abundant constituents and induce these therapeutic effects. Six flavones are proven to be the major bioactive flavones in Radix Scutellariae existing in the forms of aglycones (baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A) and glycosides (baicalin, wogonoside, oroxylin A-7-glucuronide). All six flavones are pharmacologically active and show great potential in the treatment of inflammation, cancers and virus-related diseases. The current review covers the preparation of the herb Radix Scutellariae, quantification of its major bioactive ingredients, and pharmacological effects of the proposed six bioactive flavones. In addition, this reviewsummarizes the pharmacokinetic profiles of the bioactive flavones reported so far that could be used for further improvement of their pharmacokinetic study. Moreover, due to abundant co-occurring bioactive components in Radix Scutellariae, our review further documents the pharmacokinetic interactions among them. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

81555234240	Intestinal absorbability of three Radix Puerariae isoflavones including daidzein, daidzin and puerarin	Background: Radix Puerariae (Gegen) contains abundant isoflavones in the forms of glycosides and aglycones, such as daidzein, daidzin and puerarin. This study aims to investigate the intestinal absorbability and mechanism of these three structurally related isoflavones.Methods: The bi-directional transport of these three isoflavones in Caco-2 monolayer model was performed to evaluate their absorbability and involvement of transporters in Transwell. In vitro incubation of daidzin and puerarin with rat intestinal microvilli preparation was conducted to estimate their potential form of absorption in vivo.Results: Daidzein demonstrated passive diffusion transport while puerarin did not. Daidzin showed basolateral-to-apical transport and the absorption extent could be reduced by 50% in the presence of MK571, a multidrug resistance-associated protein inhibitor (MRP). The in vitro incubation study of daidzin and puerarin indicated that daidzin was hydrolyzed to daidzein whereas puerarin remained unchanged.Conclusion: While daidzein was transported more efficiently, puerarin was resistant to intestinal hydrolysis and inefficiently transported across intestinal epithelium. Daidzin demonstrated a low intestinal absorbability due to a significant efflux transport mediated by MRPs. Daidzin was likely to be hydrolyzed by intestinal microvilli and subsequently released daidzein for intestinal absorption. © 2011 Zhang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84857637435	Comparison of intestinal absorption and disposition of structurally similar bioactive flavones in radix scutellariae	Radix Scutellariae is a commonly used herbal medicine. Baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A are three major bioactive flavones in Radix Scutellariae and share similar chemical structures. The intestinal absorption and disposition of baicalein have been systematically investigated by our group before. In this study, the intestinal absorption and disposition of wogonin and oroxylin A were further explored and compared with the profiles of baicalein to find potential structure-activity relationship. Absorptive models including Caco-2 cell monolayer model and rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion model as well as in vitro enzymatic kinetic study were employed in the current study. The absorption of baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A were favorable with wogonin showing the highest permeability based on two absorptive models. However, three flavones underwent a fast and extensive phase II metabolism. The intestinal metabolism of three flavones exhibited species difference between human and rat. Oroxylin A demonstrated the highest intrinsic clearance of glucuronidation among three flavones. The multidrug resistance proteins might be involved in the efflux of their intracellularly formed conjugated metabolites. The pathway of intestinal absorption and disposition of B, W, and OA was similar. However, the extent of permeability and metabolism was different among three flavones which might be due to the number and position of the hydroxyl group. © 2011 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

84860626084	Pharmacokinetics and disposition of various drug loaded liposomes	Due to great efforts in past 45 years, several liposomal products including two liposomal vaccine products have been commercialized and many more potential products are now under clinical trial stage. Although liposome has significantly reduced the toxicity of the drugs with improved or maintained the efficacy, its further development has been limited by its instabilities during preparation and storage, incompatibility with certain drugs, relative high cost of production and quality control as well as unspecified drug release time and sites in vivo. In vivo behaviors of liposomal drugs highly depend on their physiochemical properties including lipid composition, particle size, surface charge, surface modifications and the administrated dose as well as the route of administration. Based on the literature reports from the past two decades, the current review provided an updated summary of the key factors in liposomal preparations for clinical usage and its impact on the alternation of pharmacokinetic and disposition behaviors of drugs encapsulated in the liposome formulations. Clinical applications of liposomal preparation in anti-tumor agents, anti-infective agents as well as the macromolecules have been highlighted. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

84860706745	The transport of antiepileptic drugs by P-glycoprotein	Epilepsy is the most common serious chronic neurological disorder. Current data show that one-third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Most non-responsive epilepsy patients are resistant to several, often all, AEDs, even though the drugs differ from each other in pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of action, and interaction potential. The mechanisms underlying drug resistance of epilepsy patients are still not clear. In recent years, one of the potential mechanisms interesting researchers is over-expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp, also known as ABCB1 or MDR1) in endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in epilepsy patients. P-gp plays a central role in drug absorption and distribution in many organisms. The expression of P-gp is greater in drug-resistant than in drug-responsive patients. Some studies also indicate that several AEDs are substrates or inhibitors of P-gp, implying that P-gp may play an important role in drug resistance in refractory epilepsy. In this article, we review the clinical and laboratory evidence that P-gp expression is increased in epileptic brain tissues and that AEDs are substrates of P-gp . in vitro and . in vivo. We discuss criteria for identifying the substrate status of AEDs and use structure-activity relationship (SAR) models to predict which AEDs act as P-gp substrates. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

84861202381	In vitro and in situ evaluation of herb-drug interactions during intestinal metabolism and absorption of Baicalein	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Baicalein (B), a bioactive flavone isolated from the root of a traditional Chinese medicinal herb Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, was found to undergo extensive intestinal Phase II metabolism during its absorption process. Compounds sharing the same metabolic pathways with B or being inhibitors of enzymes UGT and SULT are expected to interfere with the metabolism of B leading to alteration of the absorption of B. The present study aims to identify potential intestinal absorption and metabolism interactions between B and four selected compounds, namely acetaminophen (APAP), (-)-epicatechin (EC), piperine (PIP) and curcumin (CUR) using in vitro and in situ models. Materials and methods: Three in vitro and one in situ methods were employed to investigate the effect of selected compounds on the metabolism and absorption on B. Incubation studies using rat intestinal s9 and Caco-2 cell lysate were used to study the effect of selected compounds on glucuronidation and sulfation of B.

Aim of the study: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Our previous studies identified Radix rubiae to have potent antiproliferative action on cultured HaCaT keratinocytes and to induce keratinocyte differentiation in mouse tail model. The present study aimed to investigate whether Radix rubiae could also induce terminal differentiation in cultured human keratinocytes. Methods and results: The cornified envelope (CE) formation assay showed that ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of Radix rubiae significantly accentuated the CE formation, a well-recognized marker of terminal differentiation, in cultured HEK and HaCaT cells in a dose and time dependent manner. Western blot analyses demonstrated that EA fraction of Radix rubiae at a concentration of 3.2 μg/ml significantly increased transglutaminase type I and involucrin expression in both HEK and HaCaT keratinocytes after 96 h treatment, a response similar to that of Ca

84862573430	Regioselective biotransformation of CNS drugs and its clinical impact on adverse drug reactions	Introduction: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) continue to be one of the major causes of failure in drug development while limiting the clinical utilities of many drugs. Contribution of the metabolites formed in vivo to ADRs could be more significant than we might have expected. Areas covered: This review focuses on the relationship between regioselectivity in biotransformation and the ADRs of drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS). "Regioselectivity" is defined as an exclusively or significantly preferential metabolic reaction at one (or several) site(s) on the substrate molecule. Several CNS drugs and toxicants, of which the metabolites play pivotal roles in ADRs, are summarized in details with the highlight on the roles of metabolism in both toxification and detoxification. The article also discusses in silico predictions of regioselectivity and the formation of toxic metabolites which are becoming increasingly important. Expert opinion: Researchers working on CNS drugs face particular challenges in predicting drug metabolism and potential toxicities of their metabolites. A number of factors contribute to the difficulty of accurate prediction of metabolite disposition in the human brain. Better knowledge of regioselectivity in biotransformation and elucidation of the relationships between biotransformations and ADRs would definitely help designing new compounds with lower bioactivation potentials and rejuvenating the older drugs whose clinical applications are restricted by their ADRs. Administrating drugs by alternative routes such as the intranasal, transdermal, sublingual, and buccal routes could also be a strategy to reduce unwanted metabolite formations. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.

84866042722	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction of Danshen-Gegen extract with warfarin and aspirin	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Danshen-Gegen (DG) product has clinically been proven to be an effective agent for heart-tonic efficacy by our previous research. In the mean time, herb-drug interactions between DG product and its commonly co-administered drugs, such as aspirin or warfarin need to be explored to ensure its safe clinical usage. Aim of the study: Current study aims to investigate whether DG extract interacts with warfarin or aspirin when administered concomitantly to ensure the safety and efficacy of their usage. Material and methods: Five groups of SD rats (n=6/group) received DG alone (0.15 g/kg, human relevant dose), warfarin alone (0.2 mg/kg), warfarin (0.2 mg/kg) in combination with DG (0.15 g/kg), aspirin alone (10.3 mg/kg), or aspirin (10.3 mg/kg) in combination with DG (0.15 g/kg), respectively. DG product was given twice daily for 5 day. Warfain or aspirin were given once daily for 5 day. DG morning doses were given 2 h post that of warfarin/aspirin. Following first dosing on day 5, plasma samples were collected at different time points. For the pharmacodynamic measurement, whole blood was collected at 30 min after DG dosing or at 2.5 h after warfarin/aspirin dosing, and the prothrombin time assay was conducted.

0036769470	Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-flutamide inclusion complex. II. Oral and intravenous pharmacokinetics of flutamide in the rat	Purpose: The objective of this work was to determine the pharmacokinetics of flutamide (FLT) and its active metabolite, 2-hydroxy-flutamide (FLT-2-OH) in rats, following formulation in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (FLT-HPβCyD). Methods: The pharmacokinetics of FLT-HPβCyD, FLT-suspension (FLT-SUSP), and FLT-solution (FLT-COSOLV) were compared after oral (p.o.) and intravenous (i.v.) administration, respectively. In a non-crossover design, male Sprague-Dawley rats received each formulation as a single oral dose [15 mg (54 μmol) FLT/kg] by oral gavage, or single i.v. dose [1.6 mg (5.8 μmol) FLT/kg] via an indwelling jugular vein catheter. FLT and its metabolite, FLT-2-OH, were determined in plasma and urine aliquots by an HPLC method. Results: In a preliminary in vitro experiment, using the dialysis bag dissolution method, 80 % of a test dose of FLT was released from lyophilized FLT-HPβCyD into simulated gastric juice within 2 h, compared to less than 5% release from commercial FLT powder (FLT-SUSP).

84871032395	Pharmacokinetic interactions among major bioactive components in Radix Scutellariae via metabolic competition	Baicalein (B), wogonin (W) and oroxylin A (OA) are major components in Radix Scutellariae with similar pharmacokinetic properties. Due to the co-presence of these three flavones in herbal formulations for Radix Scutellariae, they are likely consumed together. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of individual flavones is influenced by each other and the underlying mechanism of the interaction. Various systems were utilized in the current study including a rat in vivo study, a Caco-2 cell monolayer model and a rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion as well as in vitro enzymatic kinetics studies. The B, W and OA given singly as well as in a mixture were administered and the corresponding pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and compared. After co-administration of the three flavones to rats, OA absorption increased significantly in comparison with when OA was administered alone. Mechanistic studies on the Caco-2 cell monolayer and rat in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion models revealed that co-administration of B, W and OA could significantly enhance their absorption and decrease the extent of phase II metabolism. Further in vitro enzymatic study and a transport study in transfected MDCK cells revealed that metabolic competition rather than membrane transporters might contribute to the pharmacokinetic interactions. The co-presence of multiple active components would result in metabolic interactions, which may induce further changes in pharmacodynamics. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84872099104	Transcriptional profiling of Chinese medicinal formula Si-Wu-Tang on breast cancer cells reveals phytoestrogenic activity	Background: Si-Wu-Tang (SWT), comprising the combination of four herbs, Paeoniae, Angelicae, Chuanxiong and Rehmanniae, is one of the most popular traditional oriental medicines for women's diseases. In our previous study, the microarray gene expression profiles of SWT on breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were found similar to the effect of β-estradiol (E2) on MCF-7 cells in the Connectivity Map database.Methods: Further data analysis was conducted to find the main similarities and differences between the effects of SWT and E2 on MCF-7 gene expression. The cell proliferation assay on MCF-7 (ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative) cells were used to examine such estrogenic activity. The estrogenic potency of SWT was further confirmed by estrogen-responsive element (ERE) luciferase reporter assay in MCF-7 cells.Results: Many estrogen regulated genes strongly up-regulated by E2 were similarly up-regulated by SWT, e.g., GREB1, PGR and EGR3. Of interest with regard to safety of SWT, the oncogenes MYBL1 and RET were strongly induced by E2 but not by SWT. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a highly concordant expression change in selected genes with data obtained by microarrays. Further supporting SWT's estrogenic activity, in MCF-7 but not in MDA-MB-231 cells, SWT stimulated cell growth at lower concentrations (< 3.0 mg/ml), while at high concentrations, it inhibits the growth of both cell lines. The growth inhibitory potency of SWT was significantly higher in MDA-MB-231 than in MCF-7 cells. The SWT-induced cell growth of MCF-7 could be blocked by addition of the estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen. In addition, SWT was able to activate the ERE activity at lower concentrations. The herbal components Angelicae, Chuanxiong and Rehmanniae at lower concentrations (< 3.0 mg/ml) also showed growth-inducing and ERE-activating activity in MCF-7 cells.Conclusions: These results revealed a new mechanism to support the clinical use of SWT for estrogen related diseases and possibly for cancer prevention. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of using microarray transcriptional profiling to discover phytoestrogenic components that are present in natural products. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84878787611	A retrospective analysis of data from toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China (Heilongjiang) between 2000 and 2010	The aim of this study was to analyze data from toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China (Heilongjiang Province) reported between 2000 and 2010, and to investigate the associations among the classes of toxic substances detected with gender, age, season, district of occurrence, and type of case. Pesticides, drugs, and alcohol were detected using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or flame ionization detection. Carbon monoxide levels were measured using ultraviolet spectrometry, and levels of cyanides, nitrites, and acid were monitored using the chemical colorimetry method. Among a total of 565 cases, 208 (36.8%) were related to accidental injury/death, 175 (31.0%) to suicide, 80 (14.2%) to homicide, 43 (7.6%) to robbery, 29 (5.1%) to fire or arson, 20 (3.5%) to intentional injury/death, 7 (1.2%) to rape, and 3 (0.5%) to kidnapping. Men constituted 65.3% of the total 565 victims, most of who were between the ages of 31 and 50 years, with the average age being 44 years. The highest number of cases (126) was reported from Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang Province. Pesticide-related cases accounted for 37.9% of the cases, with more cases occurring between April and August. Methomyl (48 cases) and fluoroacetamide (38 cases) were the most common pesticides involved in these cases. Drug-related cases accounted for 19.5% of the total poisoning cases, with benzodiazepines being the most commonly detected drugs (45 cases). More than 70% of alcohol-related cases involved the use of alcohol in crime (or affair) execution, with the blood alcohol concentration being less than 350. mg/100. mL in these cases. Carbon monoxide was detected in 16.1% of the cases, with a higher yearly incidence noted in winter. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an overall analysis of toxic substance-related cases in Northeast China. Similar to the findings observed in Central China (Hubei), our findings indicated that pesticides were the major cause of poisoning in the Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84879797970	Potential role for human P-glycoprotein in the transport of lacosamide	Purpose Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) do not effectively treat 30-40% of patients with epilepsy. Export of AEDs by P-glycoprotein (Pgp, ABCB1, or MDR1), which is overexpressed in the blood-brain barrier in drug-resistant patients, may be a mechanism for resistance to AEDs. For most recently approved AEDs, whether they are transported by Pgp is unknown. We investigated whether a new AED, lacosamide (LCM), is a substrate of human Pgp. Methods LLC-PK1 and MDCKII cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene were used to determine the substrate status of LCM in concentration equilibrium transport assays (CETAs). An equal concentration of drug was initially loaded in both the apical and basal chambers, and the concentration in both chambers was measured up to 4 h. The experiments were repeated in the presence of the Pgp inhibitors verapamil and tariquidar. Caco-2 assays were used to determine the intrinsic permeability and efflux ratio of LCM as well as its potential to inhibit digoxin, a Pgp substrate. Key Findings Lacosamide was transported by MDR1-transfected cells from basolateral to apical sides. The efflux of LCM could be completely blocked by verapamil or tariquidar. In Caco-2 assays, LCM showed high permeability without a significant efflux ratio; it did not inhibit digoxin, a Pgp substrate. Significance Although LCM is a substrate of Pgp in CETA, Caco-2 data demonstrated that passive diffusion should play a major role in the overall disposition of LCM. The critical role of Pgp should be addressed in vivo. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84879799172	Utilization of gene expression signature for quality control of traditional chinese medicine formula Si-Wu-Tang	The current study utilized a combined pharmacokinetic and genomic approach to demonstrate the feasibility of a new quality control method by using a panel of special differentially expressed genes (DEGs) as unique fingerprint to serve as marker of in vivo bioactivity for a representative traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, Si-Wu-Tang (SWT). The method involves firstly obtaining possible in vivo active components, i.e., the "absorbable" components from the permeate of the Caco-2 monolayer model to simulate oral administration of two specific SWT products (CU-SWT, J-SWT), their component single herbs (Angelicae, Chuanxiong, Paeoniae, and Rehmanniae), and a standard mixture of active compounds (ferulic acid, ligustilide, senkyunolide A). Then, these respective absorbable components were incubated with MCF-7 cells to determine the gene expression profile using microarray processing/analysis as well as real-time PCR. From the available DEGs identified following the incubation, the magnitude of change in DEGs by real-time PCR was found to be consistent with that by microarray. The designated DEGs from the CU-SWT permeate were found to be distinct from other 19 products. Furthermore, the changes in the DEGs resulting from MCF-7 cells treated by eight replicate extracts of CU-SWT on three separate days were consistent. These results demonstrated sufficient specificity and consistency of the DEG panel which could serve as a unique bioactive "fingerprint" for the designated SWT product. The present method for DEG determination may be applied to other TCM products and with further definitive study can potentially provide a unique method for quality control of TCM in the future. © 2013 American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.

Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a first-line antiepileptic drug which may be prone to drug interactions. Systematic review of herb- and food-drug interactions on CBZ is warranted to provide guidance for medical professionals when prescribing CBZ. Method. A systematic review was conducted on six English databases and four Chinese databases. Results. 196 out of 3179 articles fulfilled inclusion criteria, of which 74 articles were reviewed and 33 herbal products/dietary supplement/food interacting with CBZ were identified. No fatal or severe interactions were documented. The majority of the interactions were pharmacokinetic-based (80%). Traditional Chinese medicine accounted for most of the interactions (n = 17), followed by food (n = 10), dietary supplements (n = 3), and other herbs/botanicals (n = 3). Coadministration of 11 and 12 of the studied herbal products/dietary supplement/food significantly decreased or increased the plasma concentrations of CBZ. Regarding pharmacodynamic interaction, Xiao-yao-san, melatonin, and alcohol increased the side effects of CBZ while caffeine lowered the antiepileptic efficacy of CBZ. Conclusion. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the documented interactions between CBZ and herbal products/food/dietary supplements which assists healthcare professionals to identify potential herb-drug and food-drug interactions, thereby preventing potential adverse events and improving patients' therapeutic outcomes when prescribing CBZ. © 2013 Sophia Yui Kau Fong et al.

Yege (Gegen or Radix Puerariae lobatae), the dried root of Pueraria lobata (Wild.) Ohwi, has been widely used in China and, to a lesser extent, in Japan, Korea, and the United States. Although they have been classified into different categories in Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Yege is often used interchangeably in practice with Fenge (Radix Puerariae thomsonii), which is the dried root of Pueraria thomsonii Benth. Among various commercially available products of Radix Puerariae, injection of puerarin, the major isoflavone from Radix Puerariae, has been most widely used as a vasodilator for the treatment of angina and myocardial infarction. Considering the extensive clinical usage and recent alert of fatal herb-drug interaction of Radix Puerariae, the current review is proposed to cover its traditional applications, pharmacological activities, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and potential herb-drug interactions aiming to fill in the information gaps of this herb for frontline practitioners. Although various small, poorly designed clinical trials have demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and significant clinical benefits of Radix Puerariae, prospective randomized controlled clinical trials are needed to further establish its effective and safe use. © The Author(s) 2013.

84892726292	Alterations in the CNS effects of anti-epileptic drugs by Chinese herbal medicines	Introduction: Concomitant use of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is increasing globally. However, information summarizing how CHMs might alter the CNS effects of AEDs is lacking. Areas covered: A systematic review of the English-language articles in evidence-based databases was performed. It identified CHMs that interact with AEDs and lead to alterations in the CNS effects of AEDs. This review provides a descriptive summary of the existing information on CHM-induced changes of both the therapeutic and adverse CNS effects of AEDs, including i) anti-epileptic effect, ii) sedative effect, iii) anxiolytic effect and iv) memory impairment effect. The proposed mechanisms behind the interactions are also summarized. Expert opinion: Despite the popularity of both AEDs and CHMs, the availability of information on CHM-AED interactions that could result in altered CNS outcomes is considerably limited. Moreover, there are some insufficiencies in the study designs of the identified reports. More research, including both mechanistic and human studies, with improved study design is necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of combinational use of AEDs with CHMs. © Informa UK, Ltd.

84893315759	Influence of mefenamic acid on the intestinal absorption and metabolism of three bioactive flavones in Radix Scutellariae and potential pharmacological impact	Context: Mefenamic acid (MEF) and the dried root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Radix Scutellariae, RS) share a high possibility of combined medication to treat inflammation. Objective: The present study investigates the impact of MEF on absorption/disposition of three major components in RS (baicalein, B; wogonin, W; oroxylin A, OA) and further pharmacological changes. Materials and methods: The apparent permeability (Papp) and percentage of metabolism of B, W and OA at 10μ were measured at the absence/presence of MEF (100μ) in the Caco-2 cell monolayer model. A modified whole blood assay was employed to quantify prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 4, 6 and 8h post-oral administration with water suspension of MEF at 40mg/kg and RS at 200mg/kg. Results: In the presence of MEF, Papp of B, W and OA were increased from 1.69±0.89×10

84893201657	Bench to bed evidences for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions involving oseltamivir and Chinese medicine	Oseltamivir (OA), an ethyl ester prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is clinically used as a potent and selective inhibitor of neuraminidase. Chinese medicines have been advocated to combine with conventional drug for avian influenza. The current study aims to investigate the potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions of a Chinese medicine formula, namely, Yin Qiao San and Sang Ju Yin (CMF1), commonly used for anti-influenza in combination with OA in both rat and human, and to reveal the underlined mechanisms. It was found that although C max, AUC and urinary recovery of OC, as well as metabolic ratio (AUC OC / AUC OA), were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner following combination use of CMF1 and OA in rat studies (P < 0.01), such coadministration in 14 healthy volunteers only resulted in a trend of minor decrease in the related parameters. Further mechanistic studies found that although CMF1 could reduce absorption and metabolism of OA, it appears to enhance viral inhibition of OA (P < 0.01). In summary, although there was potential interaction between OA and CMF1 found in rat studies, its clinical impact was expected to be minimal. The coadministration of OA and CMF1 at the clinical recommended dosages is, therefore, considered to be safe. © 2014 Qi Chang et al.

84893842560	Pharmacokinetic Comparison Between the Long-Term Anesthetized, Short-Term Anesthetized and Conscious Rat Models in Nasal Drug Delivery	Purpose: To investigate the pharmacokinetic differences between the common nasal delivery models. Methods: In three different rat models [long-term anesthetized (with nasal surgery), short-term anesthetized (without nasal surgery) and conscious models], tacrine and loxapine were administered via nasal, intravenous and oral routes, and the plasma pharmacokinetics were compared among different models. Results: Systemic exposures of both drugs and their metabolites were consistently higher in long-term anesthetized model after all routes of administration in comparison to that of conscious model. Nasal bioavailabilities in long-term anesthetized model (tacrine 83%, loxapine 97%) were much higher than that in conscious model (tacrine 10%, loxapine 46%). Further studies on tacrine and its metabolites demonstrated no significant difference in t

84895497866	In vitro transport assays of rufinamide, pregabalin, and zonisamide by human P-glycoprotein	Objective: Epilepsy is resistant to treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in about one third of epilepsy patients. AED export by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) overexpressed in the blood-brain barrier may contribute to AED resistance. The Pgp transport status of many of the recently approved AEDs remains unknown. We investigated whether several new AEDs - zonisamide (ZNS), pregabalin (PGB), and rufinamide (RFM) - are human Pgp substrates. Methods: MDCKII and LLC-PK1 cells transfected with the human MDR1 gene, which encodes the Pgp protein, were used in concentration equilibrium transport assays (CETA) to determine the substrate status of ZNS, PGB, and RFM. For each drug, an equal concentration was added to apical and basal chambers, and the concentration in both chambers was measured up to 4. h. Results: RFM, ZNS, and PGB were not transported by MDR1-transfected cells from basolateral to apical sides in CETA. Conclusions: ZNS, RFM, and PGB are not substrates of human Pgp. These data suggest that resistance to these drugs may not be attributed to increased Pgp activity in resistant patients. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84897379027	Cerebral vasodilator properties of Danshen and Gegen: A study of their combined efficacy and mechanisms of actions	Danshen and Gegen are two commonly used Chinese herbal medicines for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the combination effects of these two herbs on cerebral vascular tone and their underlying mechanisms of actions. Basilar artery rings were obtained from rats and precontracted with U46619. Cumulative administrations of aqueous extracts of Danshen, Gegen, or the two herbs combined (DG; ratio 7:3) produced concentration-dependent relaxation of the artery rings. Statistical analysis on these findings produced a combination index (CI) of 1.041 at ED

84899813471	Development of a SPE-LC/MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of baicalein, wogonin, oroxylin A and their glucuronides baicalin, wogonoside and oroxyloside in rats and its application to brain uptake and plasma pharmacokinetic studies	This study aims to identify and quantify the six major bioactive flavones of the traditional Chinese medicine Scutellariae Radix (RS), including baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, wogonoside, oroxylin A and oroxyloside in rat after oral administration of a standardized RS extract. A novel, sensitive and selective method for simultaneous determination of these six analytes in rat brain and plasma using solid phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-LC/MS/MS) was developed and fully validated. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) for the six RS flavones in brain tissue were 0.02. nmol/g. The LLOQs in plasma were 0.005. nmol/ml for B, W and OA, 0.025. nmol/ml for WG and OAG, and 0.1875. nmol/ml for BG. The current study provides novel evidence of the presence of all the tested RS flavones and an isoform of BG (BG', probably baicalein-6-O-glucuronide) in the rat brain after oral administration of RS extract, suggesting their ability to permeate through the blood-brain barrier. The method was also successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of all these analytes in plasma after oral administration of RS extract (300. mg/kg) to Sprague-Dawley rats. The developed assay method provides a useful tool for both preclinical and clinical investigations on the disposition of RS flavones in brain and plasma. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84902550931	Induction of liver cytochrome P450s by Danshen-Gegen formula is the leading cause for its pharmacokinetic interactions with warfarin	Ethnopharmacological relevance Although the increased usage of herbal medicine leading to herb-drug interactions is well reported, the mechanism of such interactions between herbal medicines with conventionally prescribed drugs such as warfarin is not yet fully understood. Our previous rat in vivo study demonstrated that co-administration of Danshen-Gegen Formula (DGF), a Radix Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen) and Radix Puerariae lobatae (Gegen) containing Chinese medicine formula recently developed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, with warfarin could cause significant herb-drug interactions. The current study aims to explore the pharmacokinetics-based mechanism of the DGF-warfarin interactions during absorption, distribution and metabolism processes. Materials and methods Caco-2 cell monolayer model and rat in situ intestinal perfusion model were used to study the DGF-warfarin interactions during the intestinal absorption processes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered warfarin in presence and absence of DGF for consecutive 5 days. The microsomal activity and expression of the liver CYP isozymes were determined and compared among different treatment groups. Blood from the rats administered DGF was employed to evaluate effects of DGF on the plasma protein binding of warfarin. Results Absorption studies demonstrated that DGF could potentially increase the intestinal absorption of warfarin (32% and 75% increase of warfarin P

84911412450	Improved brain uptake of peptide-based CNS drugs via alternative routes of administrations of its nanocarrier delivery systems: A promising strategy for CNS targeting delivery of peptides	Introduction: Recently, developing peptide-based drugs to treat CNS diseases has gained increasing attention in both academics and pharmaceutical industry. However, targeting delivery of peptides to brain is one of the most challenging problems faced in the treatment of CNS diseases. Areas covered: After explaining the brain barriers limiting the delivery of peptides, the current review focuses on summarizing the most promising approaches for the enhancement of peptide and brain uptake, including delivery via alternative routes of administrations or using nanocarriers or intranasal administration of nanocarriers loaded with peptide. In addition, the biopharmaceutic, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic details of several successful peptide-based CNS drugs are highlighted. Expert opinion: Although using nanocarriers or delivery via alternative routes could improve to a certain extent the brain uptake of peptides, the magnitude of changes remains moderate. Alternatively, intranasal administration of nanocarriers loaded with peptide has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for CNS-targeted delivery of peptides.

84911450935	Modulation of the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic and adverse effects of NSAIDs by Chinese herbal medicines	Introduction: Concomitant use of NSAIDs and Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) is frequent, yet summarized information on their interactions is lacking.Areas covered: A systematic review of literature in four evidence-based English databases was performed. Articles which reported CHMs altering the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic and adverse effects of NSAIDs were identified and summarized. Such interactions may lead to beneficial, detrimental or no change in outcomes. The current review covers four therapeutic effects of NSAIDs, including: i) anti-inflammatory; ii) analgesic; iii) antiplatelet, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular; and iv) anticancer effects and four adverse effects of NSAIDs, including: i) gastrointestinal ulcer; ii) nephrotoxicity; iii) hepatotoxicity; and iv) antiplatelet effects and bleeding.Expert opinion: While majority of CHMs demonstrated effectiveness in alleviating NSAIDs-induced adverse effects and potentiating the therapeutic effects, this review provides insights for development of CHMs as add-on medications to NSAIDs therapies. However, since limited information was from well-designed clinical trials, the findings are not yet conclusive and more clinical studies are warranted to provide guidance for healthcare professionals. In future, researches on interactions between NSAIDs and CHMs are expected to grow and modern approaches such as pharmacogenomics might enhance the throughput and accuracy of identifying clinically relevant interactions.
