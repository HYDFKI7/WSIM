84939620359	Albumin overload down-regulates integrin-β1 through reactive oxygen species-endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway in podocytes	Proteinuria is a major hallmark of glomerular nephropathy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress plays an important role in glomerular nephropathy. The protein levels of integrin-β1 in podocytes are found to be negative correlation with amount of proteinuria. This study investigated whether urinary protein, particularly albumin, induced ER stress that consequently reduced integrin-β1 expression. All experiments were performed using primary cultured rat podocyte. Protein and mRNA expression were measured by western blotting and semiquantified reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Albumin uptake was found at 1 h after albumin addition. Albumin reduced precursor and mature forms of integrin-β1, but did not change mRNA levels of integrinβ1. Albumin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ER stress. Antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine) suppressed albumin-induced ER stress and decrements in precursor and mature forms of integrin-β1. Then, ER stress inhibitors (4-phenylbutyrate and salubrinal) also inhibited albumin-induced decrements in precursor and mature forms of integrin-β1. The potent ER stress inducers (thapsigargin and tunicamycin) directly decreased precursor and mature forms of integrin-β1 and led appearance of unglycosylated core protein of integrin-β1. Our results show that in proteinuric disease, albumin decreases precursor and mature forms of integrin-β1 through ROS-ER stress pathway in podocytes.

15944380710	Role of lipid control in diabetic nephropathy	Patients with diabetic nephropathy are known to be associated with many lipoprotein abnormalities, including higher plasma levels of very low-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein. Many studies have reported that lipids may induce both glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury through mediators such as cytokines, reactive oxygen species, chemokines, and through hemodynamic changes. Clinical studies in patients with diabetic nephropathy showed that lipid control can be associated with an additional effect of reduction in proteinuria. Experimental studies demonstrated that lipid-lowering agents exerted a certain degree of renoprotection, through both indirect effects from lipid lowering and a direct effect on cell protection. Therefore, lipid control appears to be important in the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of end-stage renal failure in many countries, including Taiwan. One of the major risk factors for the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy is dyslipidemia. In this paper we will review the role of lipid in mediating renal injury and the beneficial effects of lipid control in diabetic nephropathy. © 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology.

17444416102	Increased glomerular and extracellular malondialdehyde levels in patients and rats with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis	Background: Evidence suggests an increase in oxidative stress in patients with chronic kidney disease, as glomerulosclerosis is the prerequisite for chronic kidney disease; whether the oxidative stress already exists early on is not known. Materials and methods: In this study we measured the plasma and urinary levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), the end product of lipid peroxidation, and assessed the immunoreactivity of MDA and Superoxide dismutase (SOD) in glomeruli of patients and rats with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), and compared our findings with those of minimal change disease (MCD) and normal controls (NC). Results: Our results showed that plasma MDA level was significantly increased in patients with FSGS compared with both patients with MCD and normal controls. The urinary MDA level was also significantly increased and was significantly correlated with plasma MDA level in patients with FSGS. The immunostaining for glomerular MDA and SOD was significantly higher in the patients with FSGS than in either the patients with MCD or NC, and was also significantly higher in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced FSGS than in rats with MCD. Glomerular MDA level was significantly correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis in the patients with FSGS. Conclusions: Our data suggest that oxidative stress occurs early on before the onset of renal failure, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

20444387939	Allopurinol-induced severe hypersensitivity with acute renal failure	A 62-year-old male was sent to the emergency room due to a high fever and generalized skin rash after taking allopurinol for 9 days. Physical examination was normal except for the generalized skin rash presenting with erythematous macules. Complete blood count showed leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Blood biochemistry showed impaired renal and hepatic function. Pathologic examination concluded that the skin rash was erythema multiforme. These findings met the diagnostic criteria for allopurinol-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS). Our patient not only had the most common skin lesion but soon developed acute renal failure that required intermittent hemodialysis, despite rapid discontinuation of allopurinol and adequate hydration and steroid therapy. No other causes of acute renal failure were found. Renal impairment was the worst part of the patient's condition and he never completely recovered. AHS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute renal and hepatic failure in patients with evidence of allergy and recent use of allopurinol. © 2005 Elsevier. All rights reserved.

18744379470	7-84 parathyroid hormone fragments are proportionally increased with the severity of uremic hyperparathyroidism	Aims: Recent progress in PTH assay has revealed that the intact PTH assay kit in current use does not differentiate between the truncated 7-84 PTH molecule and the 1-84 PTH molecule. In our series, we examined the effectiveness of a new PTH assay as a noninvasive method of evaluating severity of uremic hyperparathyroidism. Methods and materials: Two hundred and seventy hemodialysis (HD) patients recruited from three HD centers were included and divided into subgroups according to the conventional iPTH assay results. Pre-dialysis blood samples were collected and subjected to two different PTH assays: "intact" PTH assay (iPTH) and "whole" PTH (wPTH) assay. Two biochemical markers of bone remodeling were also examined. Results: In all cases, PTH levels determined by the wPTH assay were in the average 32.3% lower than those determined by the iPTH assay. The difference of the results of the two PTH assay methods, which indicated the portion of 7-84 PTH fragments of the total PTH molecules measured with the iPTH assay, was gradually increased while the severity of uremic hyperparathyroidism increased. Biochemical markers of bone formation/resorption showed a similar change. Conclusion: The portion of the 7-84 PTH fragments and markers of increased bone remover increased in proportion to the severity of uremic hyperparathyroidism. This finding disproves the hypothetical role of 7-84 PTH fragments alone as the noninvasive marker of low-turnover bone disease in HD patients. ©2005 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

18844389741	Alterations of glomerular and extracellular levels of glutathione peroxidase in patients and experimental rats with diabetic nephropathy	To investigate the status and role of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in diabetic nephropathy, we measured GPX in the plasma and urine of 14 patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis (DGS) and measured glomerular GPX immunostaining in these patients and in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes of varying duration. Plasma GPX levels were significantly lower in DGS patients than in diabetic patients without nephropathy (P <. 05) or normal controls (P <. 01). Urinary GPX concentrations were also significantly lower in DGS patients than in diabetic patients without nephropathy or normal controls (both P <. 05). Immunostaining of glomerular GPX was significantly less in DGS patients than in normal controls (P <. 05) and was negatively correlated with the glomerular sclerosis score and the index of mesangial expansion. Serial examination of glomerular GPX in diabetic rats showed that immunostaining scores for glomerular GPX in rats were significantly lower than those in normal control rats after 1 and 3 months' duration of diabetes, and staining scores were also significantly lower in rats killed after 3 months of diabetes than in those killed after 1 week. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that GPX concentrations in plasma, urine, and glomeruli are decreased in individuals with DGS and that the immunostaining of glomerular GPX decreases progressively. © 2005 Mosby, Inc.

19344362711	Decreased synthesis of glomerular adrenomedullin in patients with IgA nephropathy	Adrenomedullin (AM) immunostaining and gene expression have seldom been measured in human kidneys. Because previous studies have shown that AM exerts antiproliferative effects on rat mesangial cells in vitro and that urine AM levels are decreased in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, we measured glomerular AM and its gene expression in patients with primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Glomerular AM was measured by immunohistochemical staining, and glomerular AM mRNA was measured by in situ hybridization. Plasma and urine AM were measured by radioimmunoassay. The results showed that both the intensity of immunostaining for glomerular AM and the glomerular expression of AM mRNA were significantly decreased in IgAN patients compared with normal controls (both P < .05). Similar results were not observed in patients with non-IgA MsPGN. Glomerular AM immunostaining and glomerular AM mRNA expression were significantly correlated (P < .001), and both were negatively correlated with the number of glomerular cells (P < .05 and < .01, respectively). Both glomerular AM immunostaining and glomerular AM mRNA expression were correlated with urine AM levels (both P < .001), but not with plasma AM levels. The urine AM level was significantly lower in IgAN patients than in normal controls (P < .01), whereas the plasma level was not different between the 2 groups. Our findings indicate that glomerular production of AM was decreased in patients with IgA nephropathy and that this lack of glomerular AM may be related to the pathogenesis of this mesangial disease. © 2005 Mosby, Inc.

0030830018	Intravenous repletion of phosphorus deficiency in the chronic renal failure patients with severe hypophosphatemia	Severe hypophosphatemia is a potentially life-threatening medical condition and might lead to a fatal outcome in critically ill patients. The situation is further complicated by the co-morbid renal failure. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of the intravenous phosphate repletion in 15 renal failure patients with severe hypophosphatemia. Six patients with advaned renal failure and nine patients under maintenance hemodialysis, 7 males and 8 females, aged between 42 and 83 years old, were found to have serum phosphate level < 1.2 mg/dL from various medical conditions and were treated with intravenous phosphate infusion.

0030907214	Treatment of PermCath-related sepsis in uremic patients	Patients who use PermCath as the vascular access for long-term hemodialysis are occasionally confronted with catheter-related infections. Recently, we have treated 17 patients suffering from PermCath-related sepsis. The clinical presenting features were leukocytosis in 14/17, high fever and shaking chill during dialysis in 12/17, and signs of exit site infection in 3/17. No shock was found. All patients received clinical evaluation to exclude infection sources other than from blood and inside the catheter, such as pulmonary, genitourinary, hepatobiliary and cutaneous systems. Blood drawn from both PermCath and peripheral vein was sent for bacterial culture. Bacterial culture of the blood samples from PermCath revealed Staphylococcus sp. in 7/17, Pseudomonas sp. in 5/17, Enterobacter sp. in 4/17, Streptococcus sp. in 1/17. Fourteen blood samples from peripheral vein showed positive culture results identical to those from PermCath, but negative study were noted in three other patients. The patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group I: systemic antibiotics without PermCath removal in 7, Group II: 'locked-in' retention in addition to systemic anti-biotics in 10. Antibiotics were empirically chosen according to bacteriological studies. In the 'locked-in' retention treatment, antibiotics were retained into both the inflow and outflow PermCath lumens in the exact volume of each lumen for 24 hours. The antibiotics solutions were replaced one daily basis. The same antibiotics were also given intravenously. Duration of treatment depended on clinical progression and follow-up blood culture results and ranged between 13 and 24 days. The schedule of dialysis was not changed through the period of PermCath-related sepsis. The sepsis was en red in all group if cases but not in 2 of group I and resulted in mortality in these 2 patients. The PermCaths were preserted in 5/7 in group I with two mortality cases and all except one preserved in group II patients without mortality. We suggested that 'locked-in' retention in addition to systemic antibiotics is the treatment of choice for the patients with PermCath-related sepsis. This method also preserves the functional integrity of PermCath, which is the lifeline vascular access of the patients with exhansted native vessels.

0031970072	Medullary cystic disease: A family study	Medullary cystic disease of the kidney is characterized by progressive tubulointerstitial disease with medullary cyst formation and secondary glomerular sclerosis. We treated a patient with chronic renal failure and investigated the family history of renal disease. The patient, an 18-year- old woman, was admitted due to poor appetite and fatigue for several months. Findings on physical examinations were normal except for a pale conjunctiva. Urinalysis revealed only mild proteinuria with clear sediment. The hemogram showed normocytic normochromic anemia with hemoglobin 86 g/L. The patient was azotemic and her creatinine clearance rate was 10.7 mL/min. Renal sonography showed contraction of both kidneys with a marked increase in cortical echogenicity. One small cyst was found in the medullary area. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging revealed several medullary cysts. Percutaneous renal biopsy showed focal and periglomerular sclerosis, marked tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. Ten of her family members were examined for renal function, and by sonography and CT. Five had medullary cysts, and three of the five showed abnormal renal function. Medullary cystic disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with renal disease and a positive family history.

23944523794	Correlation of plasma homocysteine level with arterial stiffness and pulse pressure in hemodialysis patients	Elevated plasma homocysteine, arterial stiffness, and increased pulse pressure (PP) are independently associated with higher cardiovascular risk in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of plasma homocysteine on arterial stiffness and PP in hemodialysis (HD) patients. One hundred and nine HD patients were stratified into three groups by plasma homocysteine levels: low (11.2-20.8 μmol/L), middle (21.2-25.1 μmol/L), and high tertiles of plasma homocysteine (Hcy) group (25.2-43.9 μmol/L). Using a computerized oscillometry, we measured the arterial stiffness index (ASI) and blood pressure (BP) hemodynamic parameters in the brachial artery. The high Hcy group exhibited a higher ASI (110.4 ± 129.5 versus 46.2 ± 17.5, mean ± S.E., P < 0.01), PP (59.7 ± 23.1 versus 43.3 ± 16.3 mmHg, P < 0.01), and age (57.8 ± 14.1 versus 49.9 ± 12.7 years, P < 0.05) compared with the low Hcy group. Plasma homocysteine was significantly correlated with ASI (r = 0.25, P < 0.001), PP (r = 0.33, P < 0.001), systolic BP (r = 0.31, P < 0.001), and age (r = 0.24, P < 0.05). Serum ferritin was significantly correlated with ASI (r = 0.24, P < 0.05) and PP (r = 0.23, P < 0.05). ASI was also correlated with PP (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses showed that both plasma homocysteine and serum ferritin had significant associations with ASI (β = 4.246, P = 0.007 and β = 0.024, P = 0.006, respectively), and with PP (β = 1.089, P = 0.002 and β = 0.005, P = 0.005, respectively) independent of other classic risk factors for atherosclerosis. In conclusion, plasma homocysteine, along with serum ferritin, may act as an important predictor for arterial stiffness and PP in HD patients. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

25444440403	Increased glomerular and extracellular malondialdehyde levels in patients and rats with diabetic nephropathy	Results from animal experiments have suggested that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in tissue damage associated with diabetes. To determine whether ROS are involved in patients with diabetic nephropathy, we measured the plasma and urinary levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an important marker of lipid peroxidation, and assessed the immunoreactivity of MDA and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in glomeruli of patients and experimental rats with diabetic nephropathy. Both plasma and urinary MDA levels were significantly higher in patients with diabetic glomerulosclerosis (DGS) than those of diabetic patients without proteinuria, proteinuric patients without diabetes, and normal controls. In DGS patients, the plasma MDA was significantly correlated with urinary MDA (p<0.05). The urinary MDA, but not plasma MDA, was significantly correlated with the degree of glomerulosclerosis and the index of mesangial expansion (both p<0.01) in DGS patients. The immunostaining score of glomerular MDA and SOD were also significantly higher in DGS patients than in control kidneys. In rats with diabetes for more than one month, the glomerular immunostaining for both MDA and SOD were also significantly higher than in controls rats, and both were increased with the progression of diabetes. Our results suggest that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis and the progression of DGS. © 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

33745893200	Endothelin-1 regulates parathyroid hormones expression of human parathyroid cells	Objective: Parathyroid cells synthesize and release endothelin-1 (ET-1). ET-1 displays an in vitro inhibitory effect on basal parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and also counteracts PTH hypersecretion stimulated by low calcium. Such effects are further demonstrated in vivo, independent of the changes in calcitonin. We propose that ET-1 may regulate the pathogenesis of uremic hyperparathyroidism. However, this was not directly demonstrated in human parathyroid glands. Design: Hyperplastic parathyroid glands are obtained from the surgical operation for uremic hyperparathyroidism. Cells are isolated by enzyme digestion and treated with ET-1, and are assessed for PTH mRNA expression. PTH in the plasma and the medium is measured by a newly developed method to detect the whole PTH (1-84). Patients: Uremic patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism and ultrasonography-proved hypertrophy of parathyroid glands received elective surgical approaches under general anesthesia. The resected glands were immediately taken to the laboratory for fresh isolation. Measurements: Following ET-1 treatment, PTH mRNA expression is evaluated by RT-PCR method. ET-1 is detected with radioimmunoassay kit and PTH is measured by a new commercially available Duo PTH kit. Results: ET-1 exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect (from 10

33749612536	Decreased B cells and IgA-secreting B cells partially explain the high prevalence of IgA deficiency in dialysis patients	Aims: We previously reported 2 hemodialysis (HD) patients with recurrent infections and selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD). We further demonstrated that serum IgA levels were lower and the prevalence of IgAD was higher in uremic patients. The exact mechanisms of IgAD in uremic patients largely remained unclear. In some patients, it was caused by anti-IgA antibody neutralization and subsequent destruction. We performed the present study to survey if there is any defect in IgA production. Materials and methods: 288 patients were initially included for examination of serum immunoglobulins. 16 normal persons, 16 dialysis patients without IgAD, and 12 dialysis patients with IgAD were enrolled after the initial examination. Blood was drawn into heparinized tubes. WBC counts and lymphocyte percentage were examined by a CBC counter. Lymphocytes were separated by the Ficoll-Paque method. Flow cytometry was utilized to isolate the B cell and IgA-secreting B cell after staining with CD19 phycoerythrin and FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgA antibody. Results: There is no significant difference between WBC counts or total lymphocyte counts of these 3 groups. However, we found a lower percentage of total lymphocyte counts in dialysis patients, either with or without IgAD. The total B cell numbers were lower in dialysis patients with IgAD. In addition, there were fewer IgA-secreting B cells in dialysis patients with IgAD. Conclusion: Decreased B cell and IgA-secreting B cell counts are seen in uremic patients with IgAD. This, in turn, indicates that there might be a defect of IgA production in some patients, rather than IgA destruction by anti-IgA antibodies as seen in some other patients. Further study is needed to investigate the mechanisms of decreased B cells and IgA-secreting B cells. © 2006 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

34247142835	Effects of glucose-free dialysis solutions on human peritoneal mesothelial cells	Background: Glucose-free dialysis solutions may be more biocompatible owing to the physiological pH and the lack of glucose degradation products, and the effects can be reflected by the changes in some markers of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC). Method: Peritoneal effluents were collected in 17 CAPD patients after one daily exchange of glucose-containing dialysate to Nutrineal (1.1% amino acid-based PDF), and human PMC were cultured from peritoneal effluent and treated with various peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions. Results: The level of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in peritoneal effluent increased significantly after using Nutrineal® for 3 months (p = 0.045), whereas that of procollagen I peptide (PICP) remained unaltered. Production of CA125 by human PMC showed a time-responsive increase after stimulation with Nutrineal and Extraneal (icodextran-based PDF). An increased expression of CA125 was observed in cultured human PMC treated with various PD solutions, and the increase induced by Nutrineal was lower than that induced by 4.25% Dianeal® and Extraneal®. A lower increase was also observed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The levels of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), however, were not altered. Conclusion: Nutrineal is more biocompatible to the peritoneal membrane than the conventional PD solutions tested herein, reflected by both the in vivo and in vitro response of CA125.

34249685451	Difficulty in diagnosis and treatment of dengue hemorrhagic fever in patients with chronic renal failure: Report of three cases of mortality	In 2002, an outbreak of dengue fever (DF) in Taiwan caused mortality in some patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). We report three cases of CRF who died of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) despite an intensive care process. The difficulty in diagnosis and the treatment dilemma attributable to ambiguity in symptoms and signs between CRF and DF may delay the diagnosis, contributing to a high risk of mortality. The narrow window of fluid tolerance in patients with CRF further hampers the success of resuscitation in DHF and DSS. Continuous venous to venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) is helpful in managing a condition with unstable hemodynamics. However, to decrease mortality, the physician must pay great attention to ensure an early awareness of DHF/DSS and deliver a prompt and aggressive treatment of patients of dengue viral infections with chronic renal failure.

34547502348	Combined herpes viral and candidal esophagitis in a CAPD patient: Case report and review of literature	Concomitant herpetic and candidal esophagitis is a very rare disease that had not been reported in uremic patients. A 57-year-old woman receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy for 3 years was admitted due to CAPD-related peritonitis. Endoscopic examination was performed due to severe epigastralgia and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and combined herpetic and candidal esophagitis was diagnosed. Intravenous acyclovir and fluconazole were prescribed and symptoms improved. The patient subsequently died due to progressive sepsis and respiratory failure. This is the first report of a dual infectious esophagitis in a uremic patient. Since infectious esophagitis may cause severe complications, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are important. © Copyright 2007 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

36849031181	Isovolumic Relaxation Flow Propagation Velocity: A Promising Load-Independent Relaxation Parameter in Hemodialysis Patients	The aim of this study is to evaluate whether isovolumic relaxation flow propagation velocity (IRFPV), a newly proposed relaxation parameter, is independent of load alterations. Thirty-nine uremic patients (21 men; age 62 ± 10 y) who underwent echocardiography 1 h before and 1 h after hemodialysis (HD) were included. After HD, body weight, systolic blood pressure, early transmitral filling wave velocity (E), early diastolic mitral annular velocity (Ea) and early diastolic inflow propagation velocity (EPV) decreased significantly (p ≤ 0.007), while IRFPV kept constant (p = 0.550). A subgroup analysis showed that in patients with body weight reduction <2.5 kg, E (p = 0.005) decreased significantly, but Ea (p = 0.078), EPV (p = 0.155) and IRFPV (p = 0.324) did not change after HD. In patients with body weight reduction ≥2.5 kg, E (p < 0.001), Ea (p = 0.001) and EPV (p = 0.001) decreased significantly but IRFPV (p = 0.715) was still constant after HD. In conclusion, IRFPV may be a load-independent parameter in assessing left ventricular diastolic function. However, Ea and EPV are load-independent only at minor load alterations. In evaluating left ventricular diastolic function in HD patients whose loading conditions frequently vary with time, IRFPV seems to be more adequate than Ea and EPV.

36249018274	Influence of different measurement time points on brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index in hemodialysis patients	In order to ensure that they are reliable markers of atherosclerosis and suitable for repetitive follow-up of disease progression and management responses in hemodialysis (HD) patients, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ankle-brachial index (ABI) should be tested to see whether they change with different measurement time points. The aim of this study was to assess whether baPWV and ABI vary according to whether they are measured before HD, after HD, or on the next dialysis-free day. Eighty-nine patients undergoing regular HD were enrolled. The baPWV and ABI were measured 10-30 min before and after HID, and if patients agreed, on the next dialysis-free day. The third measurement of baPWV and ABI, performed 22 ± 2 h after HD, was taken in 72 patients (81%). The body weight reduction after HD was 2.5 ± 0.9 kg (p<0.001). The brachial and ankle systolic and diastolic blood pressures before HD were significantly higher than those after HD and on the next dialysis-free day (p≤0.038). Right and left baPWV increased significantly after HD (p≤0.006), but returned to the pre-dialysis level on the next dialysis-free day. However, the right and left ABI remained constant before and after HD, or on the next dialysis-free day (p≥0.498). In conclusion, despite the significant decrease in body weight and blood pressures, baPWV increased significantly after HD. In addition, baPWV, but not ABI, may vary at different measurement time points. Therefore, baPWV, but not ABI, should be assessed in a timely manner in HD patients.

0032956250	Short- and long-term uses of calcium acetate do not change hair and serum zinc concentrations in hemodialysis patients	Calcium acetate (CaAc) acutely decreases absorption of concomitantly administered zinc gluconate (Hwang et al., AJKD 1992), but its long-term effect on zinc metabolism has not been studied. This study is intended to elucidate whether use of CaAc as phosphate binder on a daily basis affects zinc status in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Effects of CaAc on serum zinc were studied in 44 HD patients for 8 weeks (short-term). In 10 of these patients, the changes of serum and hair zinc were followed for 8 months (long-term). The daily dose of CaAc contained 25.35 mmol elemental calcium. Serum and hair zinc concentrations were measured by atomic absorptiometry. Our results were as follows: (i) in the short-term study, serum zinc concentrations did not show a significant difference compared to the baseline; (ii) in the long- term study, serum zinc concentrations showed no significant difference between different time points (11.0 ± 0.5 in the beginning, 11.9 ± 0.4 after 2 months, 11.4 ± 0.4 after 4 months and 11.3 ± 0.5 μmol/L after 8 months, n=10). However, these values were all significantly lower than in the normal controls (15.7 ± 0.5 μmol/L, n= 16); (iii) hair zinc content was not significantly different from the baseline level (2.7 ± 0.1 in the beginning, 2.4 ± 0.1 after 2 months, 2.6 ± 0.2 after 4 months, 3.1 ± 0.1 μmol/g hair, and from that of normal controls, 2.7 ± 0.2 μmol/g hair). In conclusion, daily application of CaAc does not significantly interfere with zinc absorption and storage in HD patients. However, the comparable hair zinc content in the presence of decreased serum zinc concentrations indicates that the metabolic processing of zinc in HD patients is different from that of normal individuals.

0034087946	In vivo effect of endothelin-1 on plasma calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations	We have previously reported an in vitro inhibitory effect of endothelin- 1 (ET-1) on parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. In the present experiment, ET-1 was infused into rabbits to study the in vivo effect of ET-1 on the changes in calcium, magnesium, PTH and calcitonin concentrations. Femoral arteries and veins of anesthetized male rabbits were cannulated to monitor vital signs, blood sampling and infusion of the agents being studied. Infusion of ET-1 (1, 5, 10 and 20 ng/kg per min) induced a dose-dependent decline in plasma ionized calcium concentrations from 6.68 ± 0.26 to 5.50 ± 0.46 mg/dl (P < 0.05) and a decrease in calcitonin concentrations from 48.6 ± 6.5 to 32.5 ± 4.7 pg/ml. PTH concentrations increased from 58.3 ± 10.2 to 159.4 ± 22.1 pg/ml. In a separate experiment, calcium gluconate solution was simultaneously infused to keep calcium concentrations steady, thereby proving a calcium 'clamp'. In normal calcium concentration, ET-1 infusion gradually decreased PTH concentrations from 71.4 ± 8.6 to 38.0 ± 6.2 pg/ml. We further infused sodium citrate solution to decrease the calcium concentration (2.0 mg/dl less) and calcium gluconate solution was infused to keep calcium concentrations steadily less than normal. PTH concentrations were initially stimulated by the induction of hypocalcemia (68.1 ± 11.2 to 135.6 ± 8.5 pg/ml), but decreased by ET-1 infusion (135.6 ± 8.5 to 85.1 ± 15.2 pg/ml). Plasma magnesium concentrations did not change significantly throughout the entire study and calcitonin concentrations were not significantly changed during the calcium clamp studies.

0033956877	Fatal outcome after ingestion of star fruit (Averrhoa carambola) in uremic patients	Clinical outcome of dialysis patients after eating star fruit (Averrhoa carambola) varies, but it may be fatal. In the past 10 years, 20 such patients were treated in our hospital when they developed clinical symptoms after eating the fruit or drinking star fruit juice. Their initial presentations included sudden-onset limb numbness, muscle weakness, intractable hiccups, consciousness disturbance of various degrees, and seizure. No other major events that might be responsible for these symptoms could be identified. Eight patients died, including one patient with a serum creatinine level of 6.4 mg/dL who had not yet begun dialysis. The clinical manifestations of the survivors were similar to those who died except for consciousness disturbance and seizure. Death occurred within 5 days despite emergent hemodialysis and intensive medical care. The survivors' symptoms usually became less severe after supportive treatment, and these patients subsequently recovered without obvious sequelae. The purpose of this article is to report that patients with renal failure who ingest star fruit may develop neurological symptoms and also run the risk for death in severe cases. Mortality may also occur in patients with chronic renal failure not yet undergoing dialysis. (C) 2000 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

31944440132	Reduced podocyte expression of α3β1 integrins and podocyte depletion in patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and chronic PAN-treated rats	Integrins attach cells to extracellular matrix (ECM) and mediate signals from ECM to cells or from cells to ECM. They regulate cell functions, including adhesion, migration, cell cycle regulation, and differentiation. Podocytes may detach from the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and be excreted in the urine, and proteinuria is found in patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS); both may be associated with loss of α3β1integrins. In this study, we have examined the podocyte number in patients with primary FSGS and normal controls, and the α3- and β1-integrin subunits expression of podocytes in patients with primary FSGS and chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-treated rats by the morphometric, immunoperoxidase histochemical, and immunoelectron microscopic examination. We also measured their expression serially in rats that received repeated PAN injection. The results showed that the podocyte number was significantly decreased in patients with primary FSGS than in normal control (P < 0.05). The immunostaining score showed that both α3- and β1-integrin subunits on podocytes in patients with primary FSGS were significantly lower than in normal controls (both P < 0.01). The number of immuno-gold particles of α3- and β1-integrins at the effaced foot process area of patients with primary FSGS were also significantly decreased than that of normal controls (both P < 0.05). The immunostaining score of both α3- and β1-integrin subunits was negatively correlated with the degree of glomerular sclerosing score and the amount of daily protein loss, and they were positively correlated with the number of podocytes. Chronic 12-week PAN-treated rats showed similar findings with decreased immunostaining expression and immuno-gold particles of α3-integrin on podocytes than in normal control (both P < 0.05). The chronic PAN-treated rats also showed a trend toward gradually decreased immunostaining expression of α3-integrin subunit on podocyte during the progress from normal to FSGS state. These studies indicate that podocyte expression of α3- and β1-integrin subunits is significantly reduced in humans with primary FSGS and chronic PAN-treated rats, before the morphological changes of FSGS are observed. The decreased podocyte expression of α3β1 integrins is closely related with podocyte depletion, glomerular sclerosis, and daily protein loss in patients with primary FSGS. © 2006 Mosby, Inc.

59149097457	Associated risk factors for abnormal ankle-brachial index in hemodialysis patients in a hospital	Ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a marker for peripheral artery disease and can predict mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, it is seldom studied in southern Taiwan, an area with high prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and associated risk factors for peripheral artery disease in the ESRD population in a hospital. All routine hemodialysis patients in one regional hospital were included except for six patients who refused ABI examinations and four patients with atrial fibrillation. Finally, 225 patients formed our study group. ABI was measured using an ABI-form device (Colin VP1000). The prevalence of ABI < 0.9 and ≥ 1.3 was 15.6% and 5.8%, respectively. ABI < 0.9 was independently associated with advanced age (p = 0.027), increased pulse pressure (p = 0.005), increased hematocrit (p = 0.008) and decreased serum albumin level (p = 0.009). In addition, ABI ≥ 1.3 was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus (p = 0.019). This study demonstrated the associated risk factors of peripheral artery disease in patients with hemodialysis in a hospital. ESRD patients of advanced age and with increased pulse pressure, increased hematocrit and decreased serum albumin level had a relatively high risk for ABI < 0.9 and patients with diabetes had a relatively high risk for ABI≥1.3. © 2008 Elsevier.

0034943999	Differential effects of circulating IgA isolated from patients with IgA nephropathy on superoxide and fibronectin production of mesangial cells	Background: IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by predominant deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. Serum IgA is often elevated in patients with IgAN, and it has been postulated that it is responsible for the mesangial lesions. However, the direct effect of circulating IgA on mesangial cells is not clear. Methods: We investigated the effects of sera and IgA which were isolated from patients with IgAN on thymidine uptake, superoxide and fibronectin production and fibronectin mRNA expression of cultured rat mesangial cells, and we compared the findings to the effects of IgA isolated from patients with non-IgA mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN) and normal controls. IgA was isolated with affinity chromatography using cyanogen bromide activated Sepharose 4B coupled to sheep anti-human IgA antiserum. Results: Our results demonstrated that both sera and IgA from patients with IgAN dose-dependently increased mitogenesis of mesangial cells as measured by

0034730249	Altering expression of α3β1 integrin on podocytes of human and rats with diabetes	The adhesion molecule integrin α3β1 is the major receptor of podocyte to the glomerular capillary basement membrane (GBM). Since progressive alteration of the glomerular extracellular matrix (ECM) compartment leading to GBM thickening is common in diabetic nephropathy, we investigated the cellular distribution of α3β1 integrin in podocytes of patients with diabetic nephropathy and streptozotocininduced diabetic rats, and we evaluated the effects of high glucose on the cultured rat podocytes. Both human and rat kidneys were stained using the immunoelectron microscopy and immunoperoxidase technique with mouse monoclonal antibodies to human integrin α3 subunit. The results showed that both the number of immunogold particles and the staining of integrin α3 subunit on podocytes were weaker in patients with diabetic nephropathy than those of control kidneys. The staining of α3 on podocytes in the poorly-controlled diabetic rats was also weaker after one and three months of hyperglycemia. However, the staining was identical to controls in rats with only one week of hyperglycemia. High glucose (25 mM) but not streptozotocin in vitro suppressed the α3 expression of cultured rat podocytes. Our results demonstrated that the expression of integrin α3β1 on podocytes was suppressed in both human and rats with diabetes, possibly due to the effects of hyperglycemia, and the suppression became more severe with the duration of diabetes.

80052502866	Impaired left ventricular systolic function and increased brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity are independently associated with rapid renal function progression	Heart failure and increased arterial stiffness are associated with declining renal function. Few studies have evaluated the association between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity (baPWV) and renal function progression. The aim of this study was to assess whether LVEF<40% and baPWV are associated with a decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the progression to a renal end point of ≥25% decline in eGFR. This longitudinal study included 167 patients. The baPWV was measured with an ankle-brachial index-form device. The change in renal function was estimated by eGFR slope. The renal end point was defined as ≥25% decline in eGFR. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared and analyzed. After a multivariate analysis, serum hematocrit was positively associated with eGFR slope, and diabetes mellitus, baPWV (P=0.031) and LVEF<40% (P=0.001) were negatively associated with eGFR slope. Forty patients reached the renal end point. Multivariate, forward Cox regression analysis found that lower serum albumin and hematocrit levels, higher triglyceride levels, higher baPWV (P=0.039) and LVEF<40% (P<0.001) were independently associated with progression to the renal end point. Our results show that LVEF<40% and increased baPWV are independently associated with renal function decline and progression to the renal end point. © 2011 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.

84887295795	Association of cholesterol levels with mortality and cardiovascular events among patients with CKD and different amounts of proteinuria	Background and objectives Malnutrition and/or inflammation may modify the risk relationship of total cholesterol with cardiovascular disease in CKD patients. However, it is unclear whether the relationship of total cholesterol with cardiovascular events and mortality varies by proteinuria. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This study enrolled 3303 patients with CKD stages 3-5 from a medical center and a regional hospital between November of 2002 and May of 2009 and followed the patients until July of 2010. Results During a median 2.8-year follow-up, there were 471 (14.3%) deaths and 545 (16.5%) cardiovascular events. In an adjusted Cox model, the two highest quartiles of total cholesterol (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% confidence interval, 1.16 to 3.13 and hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.18 to 3.39 versus quartile 1, respectively) were associated with a significant higher risk of all-cause mortality in patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio<1 g/g (n=1535), but this higher risk was not seen in those patients with urine protein-to-creatinine ratio≥1 g/g (n=1768; hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 1.07 and hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.49 to 1.02 versus quartile 1, respectively). The interaction between total cholesterol and proteinuria with all-cause mortality was significant (interaction, P=0.05). However, the relationship between total cholesterol and cardiovascular events did not significantly differ by proteinuria (interaction, P=0.91). Conclusions The association between cholesterol and mortality is different among patients with different levels of proteinuria. Large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the mortality benefit should specifically target lowering hypercholesterolemia in CKD patients with different levels of proteinuria. © 2013 by the American Society of Nephrology.

84897517427	Genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 and chronic kidney disease in Taiwanese population	Taiwan has very high incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which easily progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The association between inflammation and CKD has been explored in several studies. ORAI1 functions as a pore-forming subunit of the store-operated calcium channels which are involved in the regulation of immune system. Hence, we conducted a case-control study to determine whether the genetic polymorphisms of ORAI1 gene is a susceptibility factor to CKD and its clinical features in a Taiwanese population. Five hundred seventy-nine CKD patients from a hospital-based CKD care program were included in the study. Five tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of ORAI1 were selected from the genotyping data of the Han Chinese population from the HapMap project. Among these polymorphisms, rs12313273 was found to be significantly associated with elevated serum calcium levels, which has been linked to increased risk of death in CKD patients. To have a better management of serum calcium, we suggest that ORAI1 polymorphisms might be used as a potential biomarker for initiating non-calcium-based phosphate binder in CKD patients in the future. © 2014 Daw-Yang Hwang et al.

44249087855	Role of PPAR γ for immuno-metabolic influences and impaCts on diabetic nephropathy	As an antidiabetic agent introduced in 1997, PPAR γ agonist, or thiazolidinediones (TZD), has received much attention not only in clinical research but also in basic study about its mechanism behind the clinical effects. Evidence from clinical study of TZD use in type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria had proved that TZD treatment significantly reduced urine albumin excretion (UAE). In this article, we intended to discuss the basic pathophysiology of diabetes from an immuno-metabolic viewpoint in the beginning. Then we tried to analyze the impacts on immuno-metabolic systems with regards to TZD treatment, and describe in detail about its insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we went on to explore the actions of TZD on the reduction of UAE and attenuation of renal injury. As diabetic nephropathy being the leading cause of end-stage renal disease world-wide, the exploration of PPAR γ would be promising for the development of drugs to delay or prevent diabetic nephropathy.

44249112578	Dyslipidemia and its treatment in patients with renal disorders	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with dyslipidemia, which occurs as a consequence of nephrotic syndrome or renal insufficiency and are reflected in altered apolipoprotein profile as well as elevated plasma lipid levels. High cholesterol and Oiglyceride plasma levels have been reported to be independent risk factors for development of cardiovascular disease and renal progression. Statins are widely prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general population, and patients with kidney disease, including patients on dialysis. It has been shown that statin treatment reduces proteinuria and slows renal progression, although fewer and smaller trials exist. Therefore, long-term, large scaled clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of statins on patients receiving renal replacement therapy. This review will focus on the impact of lipid disorder on renal diseases, and the effect of statins on proteinuria, on patients with CKD, and on dialysis patients. We also discuss treatment for dyslipilemia in patients with renal disorders based on up to date research.

51349162919	The actin cytoskeleton of kidney podocytes is a direct target of the antiproteinuric effect of cyclosporine A	The immunosuppressive action of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) stems from the inhibition of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling in T cells. CsA is also used for the treatment of proteinuric kidney diseases. As it stands, the antiproteinuric effect of CsA is attributed to its immunosuppressive action. Here we show that the beneficial effect of CsA on proteinuria is not dependent on NFAT inhibition in T cells, but rather results from the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in kidney podocytes. CsA blocks the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of synaptopodin, a regulator of Rho GTPases in podocytes, thereby preserving the phosphorylation-dependent synaptopodin-14-3-3β interaction. Preservation of this interaction, in turn, protects synaptopodin from cathepsin L-mediated degradation. These results represent a new view of calcineurin signaling and shed further light on the treatment of proteinuric kidney diseases. Novel calcineurin substrates such as synaptopodin may provide promising starting points for antiproteinuric drugs that avoid the serious side effects of long-term CsA treatment. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.

53749107307	Impact of renal failure on the outcome of dengue viral infection	Background and objectives: In the 2002 dengue outbreak in Taiwan, some fatal cases had the underlying disease of renal failure (RF). Physicians faced difficulty in diagnosis and treatment of these patients; however, the impacts of RF on the clinical presentations and outcomes of dengue infection have not been reported previously. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, and underlying diseases for all cases of dengue infection in a medical center. Characteristics and outcomes of dengue-infected patients with and without RF were compared. Results: From January 2002 through January 2003, 519 dengue-infected patients were enrolled, including 412 patients with classical dengue fever (DF) and 107 patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Twelve patients died in this outbreak, and all had DHF/DSS. Twenty-one (4.0%) patients were defined as being in the RF group. The RF group had a higher mortality rate than non-RF group (28.6 versus 1.2%; P < 0.001). The severity of GFR impairment was associated with higher percentages of DHF/DSS (P = 0.029) and mortality (P < 0.001). Differences in symptoms/signs and laboratory abnormalities between DF and DHF/DSS were significant in the non-RF group but not apparent in the RF group. Conclusions: The diagnosis and management of dengue infection among patients with RF must be cautious, because complicated clinical courses with a higher mortality rate were well observed.

54949087144	Comparison of ankle-brachial index and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity between patients with chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis	Background/Aims: Patients with chronic renal failure are highly predisposed to atherosclerosis. However, there is limited data about the direct comparison of atherosclerosis between patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hemodialysis. The aim of this study was to compare ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) between patients with CKD and hemodialysis and thus examined the status of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) and arterial stiffness between them. Methods: We enrolled 169 patients with CKD stage 3-5 and 225 hemodialysis patients in one regional hospital. ABI and baPWV were measured by using an ABI-form device (VP1000, Colin). Results: A higher prevalence of ABI <0.9 was found in hemodialysis patients than in CKD patients (15.6 vs. 8.3%, p = 0.030). After a multivariate analysis, ABI <0.9 was associated with increased age, diabetes mellitus (DM), increased pulse pressure, decreased serum albumin level, and hemodialysis treatment. The baPWV was positively associated with age, DM, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and negatively with body mass index. However, after adjusting for other variables, baPWV was comparable between patients with CKD and hemodialysis. Conclusions: The study revealed that PAOD might be more prevalent in patients with hemodialysis than in patients with CKD, but arterial stiffness might be comparable between them. Copyright © 2008 S.

57349180087	Aristolochic acid nephropathy due to herbal drug intake manifested differently as Fanconi's syndrome and end-stage renal failure - A 7-year follow-up	Aristolochic acid (AA) may reduce glomerular or proximal tubular function, or both. We report a married couple taking AA-containing herbal drugs. The man developed Fanconi's syndrome (FS) whereas his wife reached end-stage renal failure (ESRF). He was a 36-year-old alcoholic cirrhotic patient who had taken the Chinese herbal drugs for 6 years, presenting with muscle weakness and laboratory findings of FS; the renal pathological findings were compatible with the diagnosis of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). His 38-year-old wife, who took a lower cumulative amount of the same herbal drug for a shorter duration, developed advanced renal failure and severe anemia with pathological findings of extensive tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis but spared glomeruli. AA-I was detected in one of the herbal drugs. The wife has been on hemodialysis for 7 years, but the husband is still at the stage of slowly progressive chronic renal failure and persistent FS. None of their 5 children ever took the herbal drug, and none had renal problems during follow-up. It is important to trace the history of herbal drug in-take in all the family members because of the possibility of sharing of drugs within a family. In addition to the effect of cumulative doses of AAs and the potentially higher susceptibility of females to AAN, the roles of liver cirrhosis and related vasodilators in the protection of the renal interstitium from fibrosis are questions that warrant further study. © 2008 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K.

58149138918	Slowing renal function decline in chronic kidney disease patients after nephrology referral	Aim: Late referral of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients to nephrologists is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and is still quite common and seldom studied in Taiwan because of unique sociocultural factors. We aimed to study the decline in renal function and factors related to the change in renal function before and after referral. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the changes of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in 213 new referrals of patients with CKD stages 3-5 to the nephrology divisions of one medical centre and one regional hospital from 2001-2006. Data on demographics and laboratory investigations were collected for study.

60349109601	Cocaine-related vasculitis causing scrotal gangrene	OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of possible cocaine-related vasculitis resulting in gangrene of the scrotum and review the literature on cocaine-related vascular complications. CASE SUMMARY: A 22-year-old male presented with fever, painful swelling of the right scrotum, and a blackened ulcerated lesion on the right scrotum 3 hours after smoking crack cocaine. Blood and urine cultures and serologic tests were negative, and the D-dimer level was normal. Echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetation and results of a chest X-ray were normal. Despite treatment for presumptive orchitis with intravenous levofloxacin 750 mg/day, the ulcerated lesion of the right scrotum progressed the next day. The patient received debridement of the necrotic tissue and pathology revealed some degenerated vessels with fibrinoid deposits and inflammatory infiltrates, suggestive of vasculitis. No further tenderness and swelling of the scrotum occurred and the patient was discharged after 10 days. When he returned for follow-up, the wound had healed completely. DISCUSSIONS: Cocaine-related vascular complications, including ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and peripheral occlusive disease, all of which have various possible mechanisms, are of clinical importance. Vasculitis is one of the mechanisms of vascular complications associated with cocaine use. According to the Naranjo probability scale, cocaine was the possible causative agent of the patient's vasculitis, which led to scrotum gangrene. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature of scrotum gangrene developing after crack cocaine was smoked. CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes a rare occurrence of gangrene of the scrotum associated with cocaine smoking, which is consistent with cocaine's potent vasoconstrictive activity. Cocaine abuse has the potential to cause clinically significant ischemic events anywhere in the body, independent of the method of administration.

64049113202	Significant correlation between ankle-brachial index and vascular access failure in hemodialysis patients	Background and objectives: Vascular access failure (VAF) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. The most common cause of VAF is stenosis at the arteriovenous anastomosis because of abnormal neointimal proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. These two changes are also observed in the classic atheroma, which means atherosclerotic lesions and venous stenosis in VAF may share some similar pathogenic mechanisms. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is a reliable marker for atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between ABI <0.9 and VAF. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: All routine hemodialysis patients in one regional hospital were included except for six patients refusing ABI examinations and four patients with atrial fibrillation. Finally, 225 patients formed our study group. The study subjects were observed from arteriovenous access creation until the first episode of VAF. The mean observation period was 42.2 ± 42.8 mo. The relative VAF risk was analyzed by Cox-regression methods with adjustments for demographic and comorbid conditions. Results: VAF episodes were recorded in 111 patients. In multivariate analysis, ABI <0.9 (hazard ratio, 1.893; P = 0.039), vascular access type of arteriovenous graft (P = 0.004), and serum triglyceride level (P = 0.043) were positively associated with VAF, and serum parathyroid hormone level (P = 0.043) was negatively associated with VAF. Conclusions: Our findings show that ABI <0.9 is significantly correlated with increased VAF. Screening hemodialysis patients by means of ABI may help to identify a high-risk group for VAF.

67651098964	Determinants of Peripheral Arterial Stiffness in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in Southern Taiwan	High prevalences of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) and increased arterial stiffness have been reported in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, these have not been assessed in Taiwan where the prevalence of CKD is high. The aim of this study was to investigate the determinants of PAOD and arterial stiffness in patients with CKD in southern Taiwan. We enrolled 169 patients with stage 3-5 CKD in one regional hospital. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were measured using an ABI-form device (Colin VP1000). In multivariate analysis, ABI < 0.9 was positively correlated with the presence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.014) and negatively correlated with the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p = 0.049), and increased brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was correlated with increased age, diabetes mellitus, increased systolic blood pressure, decreased pulse pressure and decreased eGFR. This study identified determinants of PAOD and arterial stiffness in patients with CKD in one hospital in southern Taiwan. In addition to the traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, decreased eGFR was also correlated with PAOD and increased arterial stiffness in these patients. © 2009 Elsevier.

67651155839	Pharmacological dose of vitamin B12 Is as effective as low-dose folinic acid in correcting hyperhomocysteinemia of hemodialysis patients	Various regimens of folic acid-based and vitamin B12 (Vit B12) supplementations have been tried for lowering plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels in uremic patients. However, the therapeutic potency of low-dose folic acid and Vit B12 alone is not properly understood. In this study, seventy-five patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) therapy were randomized into three groups. The FNA group received intravenous (IV) supplementation with folinic acid 3 mg weekly; the Vit B12 group received IV supplementation with vitamin B12 1 mg weekly; and the combination group received IV supplementation with both agents weekly. Blood levels of Hcy, folic acid, and Vit B12 were measured monthly for three months. After three months of treatment, plasma levels of Hcy decreased significantly in all three groups when compared with their baselines (all p 0.05). The final Hcy level was significantly lower in the combination group (11.5 2.3 mol/L) when compared with that of the FNA group (15.9 5.6 mol/L, p 0.05) but not with the Vit B12 group (15.9 11.6 mol/L), although their baseline levels were similar. The percentage decreases of tHcy at the end of the treatment in the FNA group, Vit B12 group, and combination group were 16.4%, 29.3%, and 38.9% respectively. Our study showed that IV pharmacologic dose of Vit B12 alone is as effective as low-dose folic acid in correcting hyperhomocysteinemia in chronic HD patients, and combining both drugs in low doses may have added effects.

67650345315	Adherence to a diabetic care plan provides better glycemic control in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes	Tight control of blood sugar improves the outcomes for diabetic patients, but it can only be achieved by adhering to a well-organized care plan. To evaluate the effect of a diabetes care plan with reinforcement of glycemic control in diabetic patients, 98 ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes who visited our diabetes clinic every 3-4 months and who completed four education courses given by certified diabetes educators within 3 months after the first visit, were defined as the Intervention group. A total of 82 patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the Intervention group but who missed at least half of the diabetes education sessions were selected as controls. Both groups had comparable mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels at baseline, which decreased significantly at 3 months and were maintained at approximately constant levels at intervals for up to 1 year. The HbA1c decrement in the Intervention group was significantly greater than that in the Control group over the 1-year follow-up period (HbA1c change: -2.5±1.8% vs. -1.1±1.7%, p<0.01). The maximal HbA1c decrement occurred during the first 3 months, and accounted for 95.6% and 94.6% of the total HbA1c decrements in the Intervention and Control groups, respectively. In the multiple regression model, after adjustment for age, body mass index, and duration of diabetes, the Intervention group may still have a 12.6% improvement in HbA1c from their original value to the end of 1 year treatment compared with the Control group (p<0.05). Diabetes care, with reinforcement from certified diabetes educators, significantly improved and maintained the effects on glycemic control in ambulatory patients with type 2 diabetes. © 2009 Elsevier.

70350783636	Intraperitoneal bladder rupture presenting as acute bloody ascites and oliguric acute renal failure in an alcoholic liver cirrhosis patient	Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is a rare cause of acute abdomen with bloody ascites. We report herein the case of a patient who had alcoholic liver cirrhosis and multiple liver nodules, and experienced acute bloody ascites and oliguric acute renal failure in association with intraperitoneal bladder rupture. A 33-year-old male suffered from acute abdominal pain and oliguria following consumption of a large amount of alcohol and after blunt abdominal trauma. He was also found to have acute renal failure and newly onset bloody ascites that rapidly subsided following transurethral catheter drainage. Computed tomography cystography revealed intra peritoneal extravasation of contrast from the dome of the bladder, suggestive of intraperitoneal bladder rupture. The patient received surgical repair and was discharged with full recovery. This case shows that it is important for physicians to be aware of the possibility of intraperitoneal bladder rupture after alcohol consumption accompanied with abdominal blunt trauma. In particular, it has diagnostic complications for underlying liver tumors. © 2009 Dustri-Verlag Dr. K. Feistle.

0035072569	Plasma and urinary endothelin-1 in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis	The kidney is an important site of endothelin-1 (ET-1) production and is particularly susceptible to ET-1 action. Infusion of ET-1 in rats induces both functional and morphological alterations in the kidneys. Increased plasma level of ET-1 has been reported in patients with chronic renal failure. However, there are still no reports on the plasma and urinary ET-1 levels in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). In the present study, we have measured the plasma concentration and urinary excretion rate of ET-1 in 15 patients with nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS, and observed the serial changes of plasma and urinary ET-1 in nephrotic rats with FSGS, induced by repeated injection with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). ET-1 was measured with radioimmunoassay. The results showed that plasma ET-1 concentration in FSGS patients was significantly higher than in normal controls (P < 0.05), and that urinary ET-1 excretion rate was also significantly higher in FSGS patients than in normal controls (P < 0.01). In FSGS patients, the plasma and urinary ET-1 was significantly correlated (P < 0.05), and the urinary ET-1 excretion rate was significantly correlated with the amount of proteinuria (P < 0.05) and the glomerular sclerosing score (P < 0.01). In the ten rats with PAN-induced FSGS, serial examination showed a significant increase in plasma ET1 after 8 weeks of injections, while the urinary ET-1 excretion rate showed a biphasic increase that showed a peak after 4 to 6 weeks. The same changes in plasma and urinary ET-1 levels were not observed in control rats injected with normal saline at the same frequency. Our results suggest that ET1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of FSGS in both humans and rats.

76549083285	Nephrotic Syndrome Complicated by Life-Threatening Pulmonary Embolism in an Adult Patient	We report a 23-year-old male presenting with edema. He was originally admitted for an elective renal biopsy for diagnosis of renal pathology. Unfortunately, because of acute abdominal pain an exploratory laparotomy was done. Progressive azotemia and oliguria then developed, and he required temporary hemodialysis. However, he suffered from sudden-onset severe respiratory distress, and blood gas analysis showed profound hypoxemia with a marked arterial-alveolar oxygen difference. Assessment of a pulmonary embolism by radioisotope imaging was not possible because of his dependence on mechanical ventilation. Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin and intravenous methylprednisolone were given to treat the presumed pulmonary embolism and the underlying nephrotic syndrome. His partial oxygen level gradually increased after continuous heparin and steroid administration. Complete obliteration of one major pulmonary artery and partial obliteration of other smaller arteries were revealed by magnetic resonance angiography. He was discharged and followed-up as an outpatient, and was given oral warfarin and prednisolone. Follow-up magnetic resonance angiography 5 months later showed a normal pulmonary tree with no residual lesions. © 2010 Elsevier.

77049115240	Early nephrology referral is associated with prolonged survival in hemodialysis patients even after exclusion of lead-time bias	BACKGROUND: Early nephrology referral (ER) has been suggested to lower morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients, but the nature of the association has been criticized as possibly because of lead-time bias. This study aims to evaluate if ER is associated with improved survival of hemodialysis patients when the lead-time bias is excluded. METHODS: A total of 192 hemodialysis patients from a medical center and a regional hospital were enrolled in the period from January 1997 to December 2006. ER and late referral (LR) were defined as referral to nephrologists greater or less than 6 months, respectively, before the initiation of hemodialysis. Follow-up of clinical course in all patients was timed from the date at which estimate glomerular filtration rate was estimated to be 15 mL/min/1.73m. The relative overall survival was analyzed by Cox-regression adjusted for their demographic and comorbid conditions RESULTS: Compared with LR patients, ER patients were less likely to have hypoalbuminemia in the beginning of hemodialysis, more likely to have received erythropoietin or phosphate binder therapy, more likely to have a vascular access created before the first hemodialysis, and had a slower rate of renal function decline before hemodialysis. In multivariate analysis, LR (hazard ratio: 2.827; P = 0.049) and diabetes mellitus were both independently associated with increased mortality risk. The survival benefits of ER seem to be originated from the period before initiation of renal replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ER is significantly associated with prolonged survival after exclusion of lead-time bias, which is consistent with ER being associated with better clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients.© 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77950480969	Ankle brachial index as a predictor for mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease and undergoing haemodialysis	Aim: The ankle brachial index (ABI) is a marker for peripheral artery disease and can predict mortality in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and haemodialysis patients, respectively. However, it is seldom studied in Taiwan, an area with high prevalence of CKD and end-stage renal disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictors for mortality by using ABI value in patients with CKD and undergoing haemodialysis in Taiwan. Methods: One hundred and sixty-nine patients with CKD stage 3-5 and 231 haemodialysis patients were enrolled in one regional hospital. The mean follow-up period was 23.3 ± 3.3 months. Patients were stratified into three groups according to ABI value (<0.9, ≥0.9 to <1.3, and ≥1.3). The relative mortality risk was analyzed by Cox-regression methods. Results: In multivariate analysis, an ABI of 1.3 or more (hazard ratio, 3.846; P = 0.043) and coronary artery disease (P = 0.012) were positively associated with overall mortality, and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = 0.042) was negatively associated with overall mortality. In addition, an ABI of less than 0.9 (P = 0.049), an ABI of 1.3 or more (P = 0.033), coronary artery disease (P = 0.024) and haemodialysis treatment (P = 0.043) were strong predictors for cardiovascular mortality. Conclusion: Our findings show that an ABI of 1.3 or more predicts for both overall and cardiovascular mortality, and an ABI of less than 0.9 predicts for cardiovascular mortality in CKD and haemodialysis patients. Screening patients with chronic renal failure by means of ABI may help to identify a high-risk group for increased mortality. © 2010 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

77951960342	A new systolic parameter defined as the ratio of brachial pre-ejection period to brachial ejection time predicts overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients	Impaired left ventricular systolic function is an important cause of mortality in hemodialysis patients. An increase in the ratio of pre-ejection period (PEP) to ejection time (ET) is associated with a decrease in left ventricular systolic function. Brachial PEP (bPEP) and brachial ET (bET) can be automatically determined from an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device. The aim of this study was to investigate whether bPEP/bET was a useful predictor for overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. We enrolled 212 hemodialysis patients in one regional hospital. The bPEP and bET were measured using an ABI-form device. The mean follow-up period was 28.35.7 months. The relative mortality risk was analyzed by Cox-regression methods. Twenty-two deaths were recorded in 212 patients (10.4%). In a multivariate analysis, the bPEP/bET (hazard ratio HR, 1.055; P=0.047) and serum creatinine level (P=0.029) were positively and negatively associated with overall mortality, respectively. In addition, increased bPEP/bET (HR, 1.080; P=0.017), increased fasting glucose (P=0.046) and decreased serum creatinine level (P=0.004) were independent predictors for cardiovascular mortality. Our findings show that bPEP/bET, a surrogate of left ventricular systolic function, is a useful predictor for overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Screening hemodialysis patients by means of bPEP/bET may help to identify a high-risk group for increased mortality. © 2010 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.

Methods: We enrolled 32 patients with ESRD and 32 healthy controls between the ages of 26 and 50 years. Short echo time single-voxel proton MRS was acquired from volumes of interest (VOIs) located in the frontal grey and white matter, temporal white matter and basal ganglia. The choline/phospatidylcholine (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and total creatine (tCr) peaks were measured and the metabolic ratios with respect to tCr were calculated. Results: In the ESRD group, significant elevations of the Cho/tCr and mI/tCr ratios were observed for the frontal grey matter, frontal white matter, temporal white matter and basal ganglia as compared with controls. There was no significant difference in the NAA/tCr ratios at all VOIs between the ESRD patients and the healthy controls. Conclusions: Proton MRS is a useful and non-invasive imaging tool for the detection of early cerebral metabolic changes in neurologically presymptomatic ESRD patients. © 2009 European Society of Radiology.

77956598992	Iatrogenic rupture of the ureter during kidney biopsy	Perirenal hematoma, hematuria, and abdominal pain are common complications of kidney biopsy, but ureter rupture is relatively less frequent. Here we report a patient who experienced severe abdominal pain and gross hematuria following a non-smooth procedure of ultrasound-guided kidney biopsy. Computed tomography showed rupture of the left upper third of the ureter. We implanted a curled double-J catheter between the renal pelvis and urinary bladder. Abdominal pain and gross hematuria improved. After 2 months, the double-J catheter was removed and the patient had no further clinical symptoms. The possibility of ureter rupture, although rare, should be considered in the presence of abdominal pain and gross hematuria in patients after receiving a kidney biopsy. © 2010 Elsevier.

77958032497	A systolic parameter defined as the ratio of brachial pre-ejection period to brachial ejection time predicts cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease	Background: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events. An increase in the ratio of the pre-ejection period (PEP) to ejection time (ET) is correlated with a decrease of left ventricular systolic function. Brachial PEP (bPEP) and brachial ET (bET) can be automatically determined from an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device. The aim of this study is to investigate whether bPEP/ bET is a useful predictor for CV events in patients with CKD. Methods and Results: We consecutively enrolled 242 CKD patients from our outpatient department of internal medicine. The bPEP and bET were measured using an ABI-form device. CV events were defined as cardiac death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure. The study subjects were followed until the first episode of CV events occurred. The relative CV event risk was analyzed by Cox-regression methods. In the multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetes (hazard ratio (HR), 3.531; P=0.014), increased bPEP/bET (HR, 1.054; P=0.026), and decreased serum albumin level (HR, 0.525; P=0.005) were independent predictors for CV events. Conclusions: The study findings show that bPEP/bET is a useful predictor of CV events in CKD patients. Screening CKD patients by means of bPEP/bET might help to identify patients at high risk of increased CV events.

79955561822	Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and rate of renal function decline and mortality in chronic kidney disease	Background and objectives Increased arterial stiffness was reported to be associated with decreased estimated GFR (eGFR). Previous studies suggested that arterial stiffness might play a role in renal function progression in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was an independent association between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, and renal function progression in CKD patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This longitudinal study enrolled 145 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5. The baPWV was measured by using an ABI-form device. The change in renal function was estimated by eGFR slope. The study endpoints were defined as commencement of dialysis or death. Results After a stepwise multivariate analysis, the eGFR slope was positively associated with baseline eGFR and negatively associated with hypertension and baPWV (β = -0.165, P = 0.033). Seventeen patients entering dialysis, and eight deaths were recorded. Multivariate forward Cox regression analysis identified that higher baPWV (hazard ratio, 1.001; P = 0.001), lower baseline eGFR, and higher serum phosphate level were independently associated with progression to commencement of dialysis or death. Conclusions Our results show an independent association between baPWV and renal function decline and progression to commencement of dialysis or death in patients with CKD. Screening CKD patients by means of baPWV may help identify a high-risk group of rapid renal function decline and progression to commencing dialysis or death. © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

0035742540	Differential effects of FMLP-activated neutrophils from patients with IgA nephropathy enhanced endothelin 1 production of glomerular mesangial cells	Background: Neutrophil infiltration in the glomeruli is common in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The pathogenetic roles of the infiltrated neutrophils and their relationship with glomerular mesangial cells, however, are not clear. Methods: We examined the effects of coculture with N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) activated neutrophils on the viability, endothelin 1 (ET-1) production, and ET-1 mRNA expression of rat glomerular mesangial cells. Neutrophils were isolated from 15 IgAN patients, from 13 patients with non-IgA mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (MsPGN), and from 10 normal controls. Results: The ET-1 production by mesangial cells was significantly higher after stimulation with FMLP-activated neutrophils from IgAN patients than that of MsPGN patients and normal controls, and this effect was significantly abolished by pre-treating mesangial cells with superoxide dismutase and partly abolished by catalase. The ET-I mRNA expression of mesangial cells showed a parallel increase with ET-1 protein. The trypan blue exclusion test showed significant mesangial cell death after stimulation with FMLP-activated neutrophils as compared with quiescent neutrophils, and the cell death was also prevented by superoxide dismutase but not catalase. The FMLP-activated neutrophils from IgAN patients produced more superoxide than those of MsPGN patients and normal controls. Conclusion: The FMLP-activated neutrophils from patients with IgAN have differential effects in enhancing the cell death and the ET-1 production of glomerular mesangial cells through the release of superoxide.

79959238445	The rs1014290 polymorphism of the SLC2A9 gene is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Han Chinese	Aims. The SLC2A9 gene encodes the glucose transporter 9, with the abilities of transporting both glucose and uric acid and is involved in the pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLC2A9 accounted for 5 variance of serum uric acid (UA). UA was identified as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). We investigated whether the SLC2A9 gene variations are associated with type 2 DM in Han Chinese. Methods. Three common SNPs of the SLC2A9, rs1014290, rs2280205, and rs3733591, were genotyped in 1003 Han Chinese randomly selected from Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Results. The variant SNP rs1014290 is associated with decreased 0.12-fold risk of type 2 DM (P =.002). Per-copy increase in the minor C-allele results in 0.13mmol/L (P =.037) and 10.03mol/L (P =.016) decrease in serum glucose and UA, respectively. Conclusions. The SNP rs1014290 within the SLC2A9 gene is associated with type 2 DM in Han Chinese. Copyright © 2011 Wan-Chun Liu et al.

79958156643	Significant correlation between ratio of brachial pre-ejection period to ejection time and left ventricular ejection fraction and mass index in patients with chronic kidney disease	Background. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. An increase in the ratio of pre-ejection period (PEP) to ejection time (ET) is correlated with an increase in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Brachial PEP (bPEP) and brachial ET (bET) can be automatically determined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device. The aims of this study were to assess whether bPEP/bET is a useful parameter in evaluation of LVMI and LVEF in patients with CKD and to evaluate the diagnostic value of bPEP/bET in the prediction of LVEF < 50%.Methods. We consecutively enrolled 234 CKD patients from our Outpatient Department of Internal Medicine. Both bPEP and bET were measured using an ABI-form device. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared and analysed.Results. Multivariate analysis results show that bPEP/bET, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index were positively while albumin was negatively associated with LVMI. In addition, increased bPEP/bET, coronary artery disease, decreased albumin, and increased triglyceride were independent factors associated with decreased LVEF. The area under the curve for bPEP/bET in the prediction of LVEF < 50% was 0.859.Conclusions. Our findings show that bPEP/bET is an important determinant of LVMI and LVEF in CKD patients. It is also helpful in identification of CKD patients with LVEF < 50%. Screening CKD patients by means of bPEP/bET may help identify a high risk group of increased LVMI and decreased LVEF. © 2009 The Author.

80053079651	A genetic polymorphism (rs17251221) in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) is associated with stone multiplicity in calcium nephrolithiasis	Calcium nephrolithiasis is one of the most common causes of renal stones. While the prevalence of this disease has increased steadily over the last 3 decades, its pathogenesis is still unclear. Previous studies have indicated that a genetic polymorphism (rs17251221) in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR) is associated with the total serum calcium levels. In this study, we collected DNA samples from 480 Taiwanese subjects (189 calcium nephrolithiasis patients and 291 controls) for genotyping the CASR gene. Our results indicated no significant association between the CASR polymorphism (rs17251221) and the susceptibility of calcium nephrolithiasis. However, we found a significant association between rs17251221 and stone multiplicity. The risk of stone multiplicity was higher in patients with the GG+GA genotype than in those with the AA genotype (chi-square test:P = 0.008;odds ratio = 4.79;95% confidence interval, 1.44-15.92;Yates' correction for chi-square test:P = 0.013). In conclusion, our results provide evidence supporting the genetic effects of CASR on the pathogenesis of calcium nephrolithiasis. © 2011 Chou et al.

80053466708	Stepwise increases in left ventricular mass index and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction correspond with the stages of chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients	Aims. Patients with diabetic nephropathy are reported to have a high prevalence of left ventricular structural and functional abnormalities. This study was designed to assess the determinants of left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in diabetic patients at various stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods. This cross-sectional study enrolled 285 diabetic patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 from our outpatient department of internal medicine. Clinical and echocardiographic parameters were compared and analyzed. Results. We found a significant stepwise increase in LVMI (P < 0.001), LVH (P < 0.001), and LVEF < 55 (P = 0.013) and a stepwise decrease in LVEF (P = 0.038) corresponding to advance in CKD stages. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that increases in LVMI and decreases in LVEF coincide with advances in CKD stages in patients with diabetes.

83155189756	Echocardiographic parameters are independently associated with rate of renal function decline and progression to dialysis in patients with chronic kidney disease	Background and objectives Cardiac abnormalities were frequently noted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study is designed to assess whether echocardiographic parameters are associated with rate of renal function decline and progression to dialysis in CKD stage 3 to 5 patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This longitudinal study enrolled 415 patients. The renal end point was defined as commencement of dialysis. The change in renal function was measured by estimated GFR (eGFR) slope. Results Progression to dialysis was predicted by wide pulse pressure, low albumin, low hemoglobin, high calcium-phosphorous product, proteinuria, diuretics use, and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (hazard ratio, 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 4.10; P = 0.05). The eGFR slope was negatively associated with total cholesterol, uric acid, proteinuria, diuretics use, and left atrial (LA) diameter (change in slope, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.11; P = 0.01) and positively associated with albumin and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (change in slope, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.08; P < 0.001). Conclusions Our study in patients of CKD stage 3 to 5 demonstrated that concentric LVH was associated with progression to dialysis, and that increased LA diameter and decreased LVEF were associated with faster renal function decline. Echocardiography may help identify high-risk groups with progressive decline in renal function to dialysis and rapid progression of renal dysfunction in CKD stage 3 to 5 patients. © 2011 by the American Society of Nephrology.

84856672524	Arterial stiffness in patients with chronic kidney disease	Introduction: Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was a marker of arterial stiffness, and increased baPWV was associated with renal function progression in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there was no study to evaluate the longitudinal change of baPWV in patients with CKD. The aims of this study were to assess whether there was a longitudinal change in baPWV and to find out the determinants of this change in patients with CKD. METHODS:: This study enrolled 52 patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 from outpatient Department of Internal Medicine. The values of baPWV were measured by an ankle-brachial index-form device at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Changes of parameters (Δ) were used to evaluate the relationship between biological markers, blood pressures, medications and baPWV. RESULTS:: The values of baPWV decreased during the 2-year follow-up (2108.4 ± 893.9 and 1897.1 ± 472.4; P = 0.016). There were also significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures during the 2-year follow-up, and Δsystolic blood pressure and baseline baPWV were the major determinants of ΔbaPWV. CONCLUSIONS:: The present longitudinal study showed that the values of baPWV decreased during the 2-year follow-up, and the major determinants of ΔbaPWV were Δsystolic blood pressure and baseline baPWV in patients with CKD. Good control of systolic blood pressure may be associated with the regression of baPWV in patients with CKD. © Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

84861158218	Echocardiographic parameters are independently associated with increased cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease	Background. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Echocardiographic measures of heart structure and function have been reported to predict adverse CV outcomes in various pathologic conditions. The aim of this study is to assess whether echocardiographic parameters are independently associated with increased CV events in patients with CKD Stages 3-5. Methods. We consecutively enrolled 505 CKD patients from our outpatient department of internal medicine. CV events were defined as CV death, hospitalization for unstable angina, non-fatal myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, transient ischemia attack and stroke. The relative CV events' risk was analyzed by Cox regression methods. Results. In the multivariate analysis, old age, the presence of diabetes, coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation; decreased serum albumin and hematocrit levels; left atrial diameter (LAD) >4.7 cm [hazard ratio (HR), 2.141; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.155-3.971, P = 0.016]; increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (HR, 1.006; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.010, P = 0.003) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <55% (HR, 2.007; 95% CI, 1.007-3.743, P = 0.028) were independently associated with increased CV events. Conclusions. Our findings show that LAD >4.7 cm, increased LVMI and LVEF <55% are independently associated with adverse CV outcomes in CKD patients. Screening CKD patients by means of echocardiography may help identify a high-risk group of poor CV prognosis. © 2011 The Author.

84862003600	Cyclin D1 expression in podocytes: Regulated by mitogens in collaboration with integrin-extracellular matrix interaction through extracellular signal-regulated kinase	Cyclin D1 plays significant roles in cell cycle entry and migration. We have documented that both integrin a3ß1 expressions and the number of podocytes were reduced in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. We wondered whether integrin- extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction was involved in the regulation of cyclin D1 expression, and the possible signaling pathways in mitogen-stimulating podocytes. Cultured podocytes were divided into serum (mitogens/growth factors)- starved and serum-stimulated groups. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to detect cyclin D1 mRNA, and Western blot analysis was used to measure protein concentrations of cyclin D1 and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) activation (p-ERK/ERK). The integrin-ECM interaction was blocked by anti-ß1-integrin monoclonal antibody or RGDS (Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser). The MEK inhibitor, U0126, was used to inhibit ERK activation. The results showed that there was little cyclin D1 protein in serum-starved groups, but it was abundant in serum-stimulated groups. Both cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels were reduced in serum-stimulated podocytes after blocking integrin-ECM interaction. ERK activation in serum-stimulated podocytes was significantly decreased after blocking integrin-ECM interaction. Cyclin D1 mRNA and protein concentrations in serum-stimulated podocytes were reduced after blocking ERK activation by U0126. We demonstrate that integrin-ECM interaction collaborates with mitogens to activate ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways which are essential for cyclin D1 expression in podocytes.

84862865679	Increasing prevalence of peripheral artery occlusive disease in hemodialysis patients: A 2-year follow-up	INTRODUCTION: Peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) has been reported to be prevalent in hemodialysis patients and influence their mortality. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 is a reliable marker for PAOD. The aims of the 2-year longitudinal study were to assess whether there was a progression in PAOD and to find out the determinants of ABI progression in hemodialysis patients. METHODS:: This study enrolled 237 routine hemodialysis patients and 154 patients completed the 2-year follow-up. The ABI was measured by an ABI-form device at baseline and at the first and second year follow-up. The change in ABI (ΔABI) was defined as ABI measured at the second year follow-up minus ABI measured at baseline. RESULTS:: The prevalence of ABI <0.9 increased yearly (10.4%, 22.7% and 27.9%, respectively; P < 0.001) and the values of ABI decreased yearly (1.11 ± 0.16, 0.97 ± 0.17 and 0.96 ± 0.19, respectively; P < 0.001) in the 154 follow-up patients. Multiple stepwise analysis identified fasting glucose level, calcium-phosphorous product, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and homocysteine level as independent determinants of ΔABI. CONCLUSIONS:: Our results demonstrated the prevalence of PAOD increased and the values of ABI decreased yearly in hemodialysis patients. The ABI progression was associated with high fasting glucose level, high calcium-phosphorous product, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and low homocysteine levels. copyright © by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

84864666542	The ratio of observed to predicted left ventricular mass is independently associated with increased cardiovascular events in patients with chronic kidney disease	A condition involving the growth of the myocardium that exceeds hemodynamic needs has been reported and called as inappropriate left ventricular mass (LVM). The appropriateness of LVM can be estimated by the ratio of observed LVM to predicted LVM. The excessive growth of LVM is frequently noted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study is designed to assess whether the ratio of observed to predicted LVM is a useful prognostic indicator of cardiovascular events in patients with moderate to advanced CKD. We consecutively enrolled 485 patients with CKD stages 3-5 from our Outpatient Department of Internal Medicine. Inappropriate LVM was defined as observed LVM more than 28% greater than the predicted value. The relative risk of cardiovascular events was analyzed by Cox-regression methods. There was a significant trend for a stepwise increase in the observed/predicted LVM ratio (P<0.001) and the prevalence of inappropriate LVM (P=0.003) corresponding to advances in CKD stages. In the multivariate analysis, old age, a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, wide pulse pressure, decreased serum albumin and hemoglobin levels, left atrial diameter 4.7 cm and increased observed/predicted LVM were independently associated with increased cardiovascular events. Our findings show that increased observed/predicted LVM is independently associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Hypertension.

84865417246	Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and brachial pre-ejection period to ejection time ratio with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease	Heart failure and increased arterial stiffness are associated with declining renal function. This longitudinal study was designed to assess whether the combination of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and the ratio of brachial pre-ejection period (bPEP) to brachial ejection time (bET) was independently associated with renal outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), stages 3-5. The baPWV and bPEP/bET values were measured using an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device in 186 patients who were classified into 4 groups according to the baPWV and bPEP/bET median values. Renal function change was determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. Rapid renal progression was defined as an eGFR slope less than 3 ml min

84866303926	Peritoneal adhesion: It can be life-threatening, and life-saving	Background: The inevitable post-inflammatory fibrosis and adhesion often compromises future treatment in peritoneal dialysis patients. Here, we describe a patient who experienced an unusual form of peritoneal adhesion that made her give up peritoneal dialysis. However, its unique pattern also saved her from infection caused by bowel perforation. Case presentation. The female patient discontinued peritoneal dialysis due to gradual dialysis inadequacy. Two months after shifting to hemodialysis with generally improved sense of well-being and no sign of abdominal illness, she was admitted to remove the Tenckhoff catheter. The procedure was smooth, but fever and abdominal pain not at the site of operation developed the next day. Abdominal ultrasound showed the presence of ascites and aspiration revealed slimy, green-yellowish pus that gave a negative result on bacterial culture. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) with oral contrast medium was performed, but failed to demonstrate the suspected bowel perforation. The examination, however, did show accumulation of pus inside the abdomen but outside the peritoneal cavity. We drained the pus with two 14-F Pig-tail catheters and the total amount of drainage approached 4000 ml. The second CT was performed with double dose of the contrast medium and found a leak of the contrast from the jejunum. She then received laparotomy and had the perforation site closed. Conclusions: In summary, this uremic patient suffered from pus accumulation inside her abdomen without obvious systemic toxic effect. The bowel perforation and pus formation might be caused by repeated peritonitis, but the peritoneal adhesion itself might also isolate her peritoneal cavity from the anticipated toxic injuries of bowel perforation. © 2012 Huang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84867257233	Association of interleg BP difference with overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis	Background and objectives An interarm BP difference has been associated with atherosclerosis and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This study investigated whether an interleg BP difference was associated with peripheral vascular disease and overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Design, setting, participants, & measurements This study enrolled 210 hemodialysis patients from December 2006 to January 2007. Bilateral leg BPs were measured simultaneously by an ankle-brachial index (ABI)-form device before hemodialysis. Results The mean follow-up period was 4.4±1.5 years. ABI, 0 <9 and high brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were independently associated with an interleg difference in systolic BP of ≥15 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥10 mmHg. Furthermore, this difference was an independent predictor for overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 3.36; 95%confidence interval [CI], 1.68-6.72; P<0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 4.84; 95%CI, 1.84-12.71; P<0.01) after adjustment for demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters. After further adjustment for ABI <0.9 and brachial-ankle pulsewave velocity, the relation remained significant to overall mortality (HR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.28-6.64; P=0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (HR, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.05-9.44; P=0.04). Conclusions A difference in systolic BP of ≥15 mmHg or diastolic BP of ≥10mmHg between legs was associated with peripheral vascular disease and increased risk for overall and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Detection of an interleg BP difference may identify hemodialysis patients at increased risk of peripheral vascular disease and overall and cardiovascular mortality. © 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.

84871013993	Decrease in ankle-brachial index over time and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hemodialysis	INTRODUCTION: Abnormal ankle-brachial index (ABI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis patients. However, whether the decrease in ABI over time carries the prognostic value is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess whether the decrease in ABI over time was a good predictor of poor cardiovascular (CV) prognosis in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 234 routine hemodialysis patients and 173 patients completed the follow-up. The ABI was measured by an ABI-form device at baseline and at the first year follow-up. The ΔABI was defined as ABI measured at the first year follow-up minus ABI measured at baseline. Progressors of ABI were defined as patients with ΔABI < -0.3. CV events were defined as CV death, hospitalization for unstable angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for arrhythmia, hospitalization for congestive heart failure and stroke. RESULTS: The follow-up period was 37.8 ± 11.1 months. In the multivariate analysis, progressors of ABI (hazard ratio, 2.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-6.68, P = 0.03), decreased albumin and increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were associated with increased CV events. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study showed ΔABI < -0.3 was independently associated with an increase in CV events. Hence, a great decrease in ABI over time might be a useful indicator of poor CV prognosis in hemodialysis patients. Copyright © 2012 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

84875178460	Framingham Risk Score with Cardiovascular Events in Chronic Kidney Disease	The Framingham Risk Score (FRS) was developed to predict coronary heart disease in various populations, and it tended to under-estimate the risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Our objectives were to determine whether FRS was associated with cardiovascular events, and to evaluate the role of new risk markers and echocardiographic parameters when they were added to a FRS model. This study enrolled 439 CKD patients. The FRS is used to identify individuals categorically as "low" (<10% of 10-year risk), "intermediate" (10-20% risk) or "high" risk (≧ 20% risk). A significant improvement in model prediction was based on the -2 log likelihood ratio statistic and c-statistic. "High" risk (v.s. "low" risk) predicts cardiovascular events either without (hazard ratios [HR] 2.090, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.144 to 3.818) or with adjustment for clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters (HR 1.924, 95% CI 1.008 to 3.673). Besides, the addition of albumin, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, left atrial diameter >4.7 cm, left ventricular hypertrophy or left ventricular ejection fraction<50% to the FRS model significantly improves the predictive values for cardiovascular events. In CKD patients, "high" risk categorized by FRS predicts cardiovascular events. Novel biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters provide additional predictive values for cardiovascular events. Future study is needed to assess whether risk assessment enhanced by using these biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters might contribute to more effective prediction and better care for patients. © 2013 Chen et al.

84874861641	Effectiveness of multidisciplinary care for chronic kidney disease in Taiwan: A 3-year prospective cohort study	Background. Previous studies have demonstrated that multidisciplinary pre-dialysis education and team care may slow the decline in renal function for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Our study compared clinical outcomes of CKD patients between multidisciplinary care (MDC) and usual care in Taiwan. Methods. In this 3-year prospective cohort study from 2008 to 2010, we recruited 1056 CKD subjects, aged 20-80 years, from five hospitals, who received either MDC or usual care, had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min, were matched one to one with the propensity score including gender, age, eGFR and co-morbidity diseases. The MDC team was under-cared based on NKF K/DOQI clinical practice guidelines and the Taiwanese pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care program. The incidence of progression to ESRD (initiation of dialysis) and mortality was compared between two groups. We also monitored blood pressure control, the rate of renal function decline, lipid profile, hematocrit and mineral bone disease control. Results. Participants were prone to be male (64.8%) with a mean age of 65.1 years and 33.1 months of mean follow-up. The MDC group had higher prescription rates of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB), phosphate binder, vitamin D3, uric acid lower agents and erythropoietin-stimulating therapy and better control in secondary hyperparathyroidism. The decline of renal function in advanced stage CKD IV and V was also slower in the MDC group (-5.1 versus -7.3 mL/min, P = 0.01). The use of temporary dialysis catheter was higher in the usual care group, and CKD patients under MDC intervention exhibited a greater willingness to choose peritoneal dialysis modality. A Cox regression revealed that the MDC group was associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to infection, and a 51% reduction in patient mortality, but a 68% increase in the risk of initiation dialysis when compared with the usual care group. Conclusion. sMDC patients were found to have more effective medication prescription according to K/DOQI guidelines and slower renal function declines in advanced/late-stage CKD. After MDC intervention, CKD patients had a better survival rate and were more likely to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) instead of mortality. © The Author 2012.

84875332636	Left atrial diameter and albumin with renal outcomes in chronic Kidney disease	Background and Aim: Echocardiographic left atrial diameter (LAD) has been documented to be an independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in various populations. An enlarged left atrium is frequently noted in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We examined the association between albumin and indexed LAD (indexed to height) and assessed whether the combination of indexed LAD and albumin was independently associated with renal outcomes in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Methods: This longitudinal study enrolled 395 patients, who were classified into four groups according to median values of indexed LAD (LAD/height) and albumin. The change in renal function was measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. Rapid renal progression was defined as eGFR slope less than -3 ml/min/1.73 m2/year. The renal end point was defined as commencement of dialysis. Results: Albumin was significantly associated with indexed LAD (β = -0.108, P = 0.024). During follow-up period, seventy-four patients started dialysis. After the multivariate analysis, the group with higher indexed LAD and lower albumin was independently associated with rapid renal progression (odds ratio, 7.979; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.028 to 21.025) and progression to dialysis (hazard ratio, 2.352; 95% CI, 1.078 to 5.131). Conclusions: Our findings show that albumin is independently associated with indexed LAD and suggest that the combination of increased indexed LAD and hypoalbuminemia is independently associated with rapid renal progression and progression to dialysis in patients with CKD. Assessments of serum albumin and indexed LAD by echocardiography are useful for predicting the risk for adverse renal outcomes. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84876530857	Association of uric acid and left ventricular mass index with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease	Background Hyperuricemia and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy are prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the association of uric acid (UA) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) with renal outcomes in patients with CKD is unclear. We conducted a study to assess whether the combination of UA and LVMI is associated with renal outcomes in patients with CKD of stages 3-5. Methods This longitudinal study enrolled 540 patients, who were classified into four groups according to sex-specific median values of UA and LVMI. The study investigated the associations of the study groups with progression to dialysis, rapid progression of decline in renal function (decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 3ml/min/1.73 m

84878900652	Ratio of transmitral E-wave velocity to early diastole mitral annulus velocity with cardiovascular and renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease	Background/Aims: Impaired left ventricular diastolic function and increased left ventricular filling pressure are frequently noted in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), even in early stages. The association of increased left ventricular filling pressure with cardiovascular and renal outcomes remains uncertain in CKD. This study is designed to assess whether the ratio of transmitral E-wave velocity (E) to early diastole mitral velocity (Ea) is associated with cardiovascular events and progression to dialysis in patients with CKD stages 3-5. Methods: This longitudinal study enrolled 356 predialysis CKD patients. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death, hospitalization for unstable angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, transient ischemia attack, and stroke. The renal endpoint was defined as commencement of dialysis. The relative cardiovascular events and renal endpoints risks were analyzed by Cox regression methods. Results: The high E/Ea was independently associated with old age, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, high systolic blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low hemoglobin, proteinuria, and worse echocardiographic profiles. Besides, the high E/Ea increased the risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio (HR) 1.067; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.017-1.119; p = 0.008) and progression to dialysis (HR 1.042; 95% CI 1.000-1.085; p = 0.048). Conclusions: Our study in patients of CKD stages 3-5 demonstrated the high E/Ea was associated with increased cardiovascular events and progression to dialysis. Assessment of the E/Ea by Doppler echocardiography is useful for predicting the risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal outcomes in CKD patients.

84879768009	Hypokalemia, Its Contributing Factors and Renal Outcomes in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease	Background:In the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population, the impact of serum potassium (sK) on renal outcomes has been controversial. Moreover, the reasons for the potential prognostic value of hypokalemia have not been elucidated.Design, Participants & Measurements:2500 participants with CKD stage 1-4 in the Integrated CKD care program Kaohsiung for delaying Dialysis (ICKD) prospective observational study were analyzed and followed up for 2.7 years. Generalized additive model was fitted to determine the cutpoints and the U-shape association between sK and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). sK was classified into five groups with the cutpoints of 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 mEq/L. Cox proportional hazard regression models predicting the outcomes were used.Results:The mean age was 62.4 years, mean sK level was 4.2±0.5 mEq/L and average eGFR was 40.6 ml/min per 1.73 m

84879370297	Performance of the Framingham Risk Score in patients receiving hemodialysis	Aim The Framingham Risk Score (FRS), calculated by considering conventional risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, was developed to predict coronary heart disease in various populations. However, reverse epidemiology has been raised concerning these risk factors in predicting high cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. Our objectives are to determine whether FRS is associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality and the role of new risk markers when they were added to a FRS model in hemodialysis patients. Methods This study enrolled 201 hemodialysis patients aged 20-80 years old. The FRS is used to identify individuals categorized as low (<6% 10-year risk), intermediate (6-20% risk) or high risk (>20% risk). Medical records were reviewed to collect clinical information. Data of ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were obtained by an ABI-form device. Results The mean follow-up period was 4.4 ± 1.5 years. Intermediate risk predicted overall hazard ratio (HR) (2.157, P = 0.039) and cardiovascular mortality (HR= 5.023; P = 0.004) versus low risk, but 'high' risk did not. High risk (vs low risk) predicted cardiovascular events (HR = 2.458, P = 0.05). Besides, the addition of ABI < 0.9 (P = 0.021) and baPWV (P = 0.014) to a FRS model significantly improved the predictive value for overall mortality. Conclusion In hemodialysis patients, intermediate risk but not high risk categorization by FRS predicted overall and cardiovascular mortality, and high risk predicted cardiovascular events. ABI < 0.9 and baPWV provided additional predictive values for overall mortality. Future study is needed to develop hemodialysis-specific equations and assess whether risk refinement using ABI < 0.9 and baPWV leads to a meaningful change in clinical outcomes. © 2013 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.

Results: The high EEa was independently associated with old age, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, high systolic blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low hemoglobin, proteinuria, and worse echocardiographic profiles. Besides, the high EEa increased the risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio (HR) 1.067; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.017-1.119; p = 0.008) and progression to dialysis (HR 1.042; 95% CI 1.000-1.085; p = 0.048). Conclusions: Our study in patients of CKD stages 3-5 demonstrated the high EEa was associated with increased cardiovascular events and progression to dialysis.

84883864845	Inhibition of type i interferon signalling prevents TLR ligand-mediated proteinuria	The mechanisms by which inflammation or autoimmunity causes proteinuric kidney disease remain elusive. Yet proteinuria is a hallmark and a prognostic indicator of kidney disease, and also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Podocytes are an integral component of the kidney filtration barrier and podocyte injury leads to proteinuria. Here we show that podocytes, which receive signals from the vascular space including circulating antigens, constitutively express TLR1-6 and TLR8. We find that podocytes can respond to TLR ligands including staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), poly I:C, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with pro-inflammatory cytokine release and activation of type I interferon (IFN) signalling. This in turn stimulates podocyte B7-1 expression and actin remodelling in vitro and transient proteinuria in vivo. Importantly, the treatment of mice with a type I IFN receptor-blocking antibody (Ab) prevents LPS-induced proteinuria. These results significantly extend our understanding of podocyte response to immune stimuli and reveal a novel mechanism for infection- or inflammation-induced transient proteinuria. Dysregulation or aberrant activation of this response may result in persistent proteinuria and progressive glomerular disease. In summary, the inhibition of glomerular type I IFN signalling with anti-IFN Abs may be a novel therapy for proteinuric kidney diseases.

84884618285	Atypical X-linked agammaglobulinaemia caused by a novel BTK mutation in a selective immunoglobulin M deficiency patient	Background: X-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA) is the most common inherited humoural immunodeficiency disorder. Mutations in the gene coding for Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) have been identified as the cause of XLA. Most affected patients exhibit a marked reduction of serum immunoglobulins, mature B cells, and an increased susceptibility to recurrent bacterial infections. However, the diagnosis of XLA can be a challenge in certain patients who have near-normal levels of serum immunoglobulin. Furthermore, reports on XLA with renal involvement are scant.Case presentation: We report an atypical XLA patient who presented with selective immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunodeficiency and nephropathy. He was diagnosed with selective IgM immunodeficiency, based on his normal serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels but undetectable serum IgM level. Intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated due to increased infections and persistent proteinuria but no improvement in proteinuria was found. A lupus-like nephritis was detected in his kidney biopsy and the proteinuria subsided after receiving a mycophenolate mofetil regimen. Although he had a history of recurrent bacterial infections since childhood, XLA was not diagnosed until B-lymphocyte surface antigen studies and a genetic analysis were conducted.Conclusions: We suggest that B-lymphocyte surface antigen studies and a BTK mutation analysis should be performed in familial patients with selective IgM deficiency to rule out atypical XLA. © 2013 Lim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84884978789	Lethal cardiac arrhythmia during central venous catheterization in a uremic patient: A case report and review of the literature	Double-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) is a rapid access technique for hemodialysis (HD) when an arteriovenous fistula or graft is not available. A variety of procedure-related complications have been reported, such as infection and pneumothorax, but serious cardiac complications are relatively less mentioned. We report a uremic woman with preexisting left bundle branch block who required emergent HD and received jugular double-lumen CVC insertion, which was complicated by short-duration ventricular tachycardia followed by complete atrio-ventricular block and bradycardia. Pharmacological management did not reverse heart rate and rhythm. External pacing was not applied because she remained hemodynamically stable in the course of HD. Heart rate returned to sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block 4 hours later and did not recur through the whole admission period. We speculate that the transient arrhythmia might have been induced by mechanical contact with the ventricular wall during the procedure with the guided metallic wire. In conclusion, physicians responsible for CVC catheterization should pay more attention to patients with preexisting cardiac arrhythmia to prevent such technical mistakes from transpiring. © 2013 International Society for Hemodialysis.

84885412354	Widespread white matter alterations in patients with end-stage renal disease: A voxelwise diffusion tensor imaging study	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: ESRD results in excessive accumulation of urea and toxic metabolites. Hemodialysis is usually performed to maintain health in patients with ESRD; however, it may cause silent white matter alterations in the earlier stages. Hence, this study aimed to perform voxelwise diffusion tensor analysis for global detection of subtle white matter alterations in patients with ESRD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with ESRD and 25 age-matched control subjects were enrolled in this study. Each subject underwent CASI assessment and DTI. After spatial normalization of DTI images, voxelwise statistical analyses were performed to compare DTI parameters between the 2 groups. RESULTS: In patients with ESRD, AD, RD, and MD values were significantly increased, whereas the FA value was significantly decreased, mostly in the corpus callosum, bilateral sagittal stratum, and pons. Multiple regression analysis further revealed that both RD andMDwere positively correlated with the duration of hemodialysis in the pons; however, no significant correlation was observed with FA. Negative correlations of RD and MD and a positive correlation of FA with the CASI score were observed in the corona radiata. CONCLUSIONS: Weconcluded that voxelwise DTI analysis is helpful in the detection of white matter alterations caused by hemodialysis.

84887202466	Association of metabolic syndrome and albuminuria with cardiovascular risk in occupational drivers	Background and Aim: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and albuminuria increase cardiovascular risk. However, in occupational drivers, the clinical significance of albuminuria and its association with MetS remain unclear. We investigated the prevalence of MetS, albuminuria and cardiovascular risk, and its associated risk factors in occupational drivers; Methods: 441 occupational drivers and 432 age- and sex-stratified matched counterpart controls were enrolled. MetS was defined using Adult Treatment Panel III for Asians. Albuminuria was defined as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g. Cardiovascular disease risk was evaluated by Framingham Risk Score (FRS); Results: A significantly higher prevalence of MetS (43.1% vs. 25.5%, p < 0.001), albuminuria (12.0% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.001) and high FRS risk ≥ 10% of 10-year risk (46.9% vs. 35.2%, p < 0.001) was found in occupational drivers compared with their counterpart controls. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that old age, a history of diabetes, gout and betel nut chewing, less exercise and albuminuria (odds ratio [OR], 2.75; p = 0.01) were risk factors for MetS, while a history of renal disease, diabetes and hypertension, and MetS (OR, 2.28; p = 0.01) were risk factors for albuminuria in occupational drivers; Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that MetS and albuminuria were public health problems in occupational drivers. An education program for promoting healthy lifestyle and a regular occupational health visit for early detection and interventions should be established. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84890409760	Abatacept in B7-1-positive proteinuric kidney disease	Abatacept (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4-immunoglobulin fusion protein [CTLA-4-Ig]) is a costimulatory inhibitor that targets B7-1 (CD80). The present report describes five patients who had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (four with recurrent FSGS after transplantation and one with primary FSGS) and proteinuria with B7-1 immunostaining of podocytes in kidney-biopsy specimens. Abatacept induced partial or complete remissions of proteinuria in these patients, suggesting that B7-1 may be a useful biomarker for the treatment of some glomerulopathies. Our data indicate that abatacept may stabilize β1-integrin activation in podocytes and reduce proteinuria in patients with B7-1-positive glomerular disease.

84892542759	High hepatitis B virus surface antigen levels and favorable interleukin 28B genotype predict spontaneous hepatitis C virus clearance in uremic patients	Background & Aims Host and viral factors interplay in the spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We aimed to explore the roles of IL28B genotypes and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in spontaneous HCV seroclearance. Methods IL28B rs8099917 genotypes, HCV and HBV markers were determined in 290 patients who were seropositive for HCV antibodies from 1681 total uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Results Persistent HCV viremia was observed in 74.6% (214/287) of patients. Logistic regression revealed that the strongest factors associated with spontaneous HCV seroclearance were carriage of rs8099917 TT-type (odds ratio/95% confidence intervals [OR/CI]: 6.22/1.41-27.35, p = 0.016), followed by concurrent hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity (OR/CI: 2.37/1.06-5.26, p = 0.035). The clearance rate was highest among patients with both positive HBsAg/rs8099917 TT-type (44.8%, OR/CI: 20.88/3.5-402.5), followed by positive HBsAg/rs8099917 non-TT-type (28.6%, OR/CI: 8.86/1.8-160.8), and negative HBsAg/rs8099917 TT-type (26.7%, OR/CI: 12.75/1.0-319.4), compared to 4% of negative HBsAg/rs8099917 non-TT-type (trend p = 0.0002). HBsAg levels, but not HBV DNA levels, were significantly associated with spontaneous HCV seroclearance. Spontaneous HCV seroclearance rate was 58.3% in patients with HBsAg >200 IU/ml/rs8099917 TT-type (OR/CI: 42.54/5.7-908.4), 28.0% in patients with HBsAg <200 IU/ml/rs8099917 TT-type or HBsAg >200 IU/ml/rs8099917 non-TT-type (OR/CI: 11.12/2.3-201.0), compared to only 3.3% in those with HBsAg <200 IU/ml/rs8099917 non-TT-type (trend p = 0.0004). Five of 214 (2.3%) HCV viremic patients at enrollment had spontaneous HCV seroclearance during one-year follow-up, which was associated with baseline HCV RNA and HBsAg levels. Conclusions High HBsAg levels and favorable IL28B genotype were additively associated with spontaneous HCV seroclearance in uremic patients.

84891785298	Dyslipoproteinemia and impairment of renal function in diabetic kidney disease: An analysis of animal studies, observational studies, and clinical trials	Dyslipoproteinemia is highly prevalent in diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Both diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with hypertriglyceridemia, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher small, dense low-density lipoprotein. A number of observational studies have reported that dyslipidemia may be associated with albuminuria, renal function impairment, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the general population, and especially in CKD and DKD patients. Diabetic glomerulopathy and the related albuminuria are the main manifestations of DKD. Numerous animal studies support the finding that glomerular atherosclerosis is the main mechanism of glomerulosclerosis in CKD and DKD. Some randomized, controlled trials suggest the use of statins for the prevention of albuminuria and renal function impairment in CKD and DKD patients. However, a large clinical study, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP), does not support that statins could reduce ESRD in CKD. In this article, we analyze the complex association of dyslipoproteinemia with DKD and deduce its relevance from animal studies, observational studies, and clinical trials. We show that special subgroups could benefit from the statin treatment. © by Lab & Life Press/SBDR.

84896738666	Anemia and left ventricular hypertrophy with renal function decline and cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease	BACKGROUND: Anemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may initiate or accelerate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This study is designed to assess whether the coexistence of anemia and LVH is independently associated with the rate of renal function decline and increased cardiovascular events in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5. METHODS: This longitudinal study enrolled 415 patients, who were classified into 4 groups according to sex-specific median values of hemoglobin and with/without LVH. The change in renal function was measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate slope. Cardiovascular events were defined as cardiovascular death, hospitalization for unstable angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, transient ischemia attack, and stroke. The relative risk of cardiovascular events was analyzed by Cox's regression method. RESULTS: The estimated glomerular filtration rate slope was significantly lower in the group with lower hemoglobin and LVH than in the other groups (P ≤ 0.031). In addition, patients with lower hemoglobin and LVH were independently associated with increased cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 4.269; 95% confidence interval, 1.402-13.000; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that the coexistence of anemia and LVH was independently associated with faster renal function decline and poor cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CKD. Assessments of serum hemoglobin level and LVH by echocardiography may help identify a high-risk group of poor renal and cardiovascular prognosis in patients with CKD stages 3 to 5.

84898438201	Discrepancy between serological and virological analysis of viral hepatitis in hemodialysis patients	Background and Aim: Viral hepatitis is a health threat for hemodialysis (HD) patients and it may be transmitted during treatment. Some patients categorized to have viral hepatitis were found to be non-viremic. To clarify the discrepancy between the serological tests in HD patients, we conducted the study. Methods: A total of 1681 HD patients was included. Blood samples were analyzed for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV). Detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA were performed in either HBsAg (+) or anti-HCV (+) samples. HBV DNA/HCV RNA was also measured in a subset of HBsAg (-) and anti-HCV (-) patients. Liver function tests were analyzed and compared with the serological and virological tests. Results: The serological tests showed that 230 patients (13.7%) were HBsAg (+) and 290 (17.3%) were anti-HCV (+). We were unable to detect HBV DNA in 97 of 230 (42.2%) HBsAg (+) patients, and HCV RNA could not be found in 76 of 290 (26.2%) anti-HCV (+) patients. In 167 HBsAg (-) patients, only one showed a trace amount of HBV DNA. None of 151 anti-HCV (-) patients showed detectable HCV RNA. The prevalence rate of viral hepatitis remains high in Taiwanese HD patients: 13.7% for HBV and 17.3% for HCV. However, virological analysis showed 42.2% non-viremic rate for HBsAg and 26.2% non-viremic rate for anti-HCV. Conclusions: The findings might challenge the presently suggested principles of bed and machine dedication and the diagnosis of viral hepatitis in HD patients. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84899932514	Hepatitis C viremia interferes with serum hepatitis B virus surface antigen and DNA levels in hepatitis B uremics	Purpose: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HCV might cause reciprocal interference. We aimed to elucidate the influence of HCV and interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genetic variants in the HBV DNA and HBsAg levels in uremic HBV carriers. Methods: Assessment of HCV and HBV viral loads, HBsAg levels and IL-28B genotype were performed in 229 HBsAg-positive patients from a cohort of 1,681 uremics. Results: Patients with HCV viremia had significantly lower HBV DNA (2.58 ± 0.80 vs. 3.16 ± 1.48 log IU/mL, p = 0.005) and HBsAg levels (1.33 ± 1.35 vs. 2.23 ± 1.31 log IU/mL, p = 0.002) compared with those without. IL-28B rs8099917 genotype had no impact on HBsAg and HBV DNA levels. In multivariate regression analysis, HCV RNA levels had a more significant negative correlation with HBsAg levels [β -0.905; 95 % confidence interval (CI) -1.477, -0.334; p = 0.002] than with HBV DNA levels (β -0.586; 95 % CI -1.206, 0.034; p = 0.06). The serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels had a positive correlation (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) among the 215 HBeAg-negative patients. However, the correlation was not observed in patients with HCV viremia (r = 0.23, p = 0.29). Linear regression analysis revealed that age (β -0.286; 95 % CI -0.043, -0.014; p < 0.001) and the HBV DNA level (β 0.373; 95 % CI 0.239, 0.549; p < 0.001) correlated independently with the HBsAg level among HBeAg-negative patients without HCV viremia, but not among those with concomitant HCV viremia. Conclusions: HCV viremia suppressed both HBsAg and HBV DNA levels. The HBsAg levels correlated with the HBV DNA levels only in patients without concomitant HCV viremia. © 2014 Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.

84900549897	Association of relatives of hemodialysis patients with metabolic syndrome, albuminuria and Framingham Risk Score	Background and Aim: Metabolic syndrome (MetS), albuminuria, and the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) are significant predictors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the relationship and clinical significance of these CVD predictors in individuals with a family history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are unclear. We investigated the association of relatives of hemodialysis (HD) patients with MetS, albuminuria, and the FRS. Methods: One hundred and sixty-six relatives of HD patients and 374 age- and sex- matched community controls were enrolled. MetS was defined using the Adult Treatment Panel III for Asians. Albuminuria was defined as urine albumin-tocreatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g. CVD risk was evaluated by the FRS. Results: A significantly higher prevalence of MetS (19.9% vs. 12.5%, P = 0.026), albuminuria (12.7% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.002) and high FRS risk ≥10% of 10-year risk (15.7% vs. 8.5%, P = 0.013) was found in relatives of HD patients compared to their counterpart controls. In multivariate analysis, being relatives of HD patients (vs. controls) was an independent determinant for MetS (odds ratio [OR], 1.785; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.045 to 3.050), albuminuria (OR, 2.891; 95% CI, 1.431 to 5.841), and high FRS risk (OR, 1.863; 95% CI, 1.015 to 3.418). Higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 1.034; 95% CI, 1.017 to 1.052) and betel nut chewing (OR, 13.994; 95% CI, 3.384 to 57.871) were independent determinants for having a high FRS risk in relatives of HD patients. Conclusions: Being relatives of HD patients was independently associated with MetS, albuminuria and high FRS risk, suggesting family members of ESRD patients may have higher CVD risks through the interactions of renal risk factors. Proactive surveillance of these CVD predictors and preventive strategies should be targeted to this high-risk population. © 2014 Huang et al.

84903381737	Hepatitis C virus infection increases risk of developing end-stage renal disease using competing risk analysis	Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are closely linked and both increase patient mortality. The association of HCV and risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has not been analyzed with competing risk model. Method: We enrolled a prospective cohort of 4,185 patients (mean age, 62 years; 41% female) registered in the CKD integrated care program at two affiliated hospitals of Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan between November 11, 2002 and May 31, 2009. With competing risk model, we analyzed the association of HCV infection, defined by seropositive of anti-HCV antibody, and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, defined by seropositive of HBV surface antigen, with the risk of entering ESRD. Results: The prevalence of HCV infection was 7.6% and it increased with the CKD stages (trend test, P<0.001), while the prevalence of HBV infection was 7.4% and no specific trend among CKD stages (tend test, P = 0.1). During the 9,101 personyear follow-up period, there were 446 death and 1,205 patients entering ESRD. After adjusting death as the competing risk, the estimated 5-year cumulative incidence rate of ESRD among patients with and without HCV infection were 52.6% and 38.4%, respectively (modified log-rank, P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that HCV infection, but not HBV infection, had higher risk of developing ESRD compared with cases without infection (HCV, HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.62; HBV, HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.89-1.35). Subgroup analyses showed consistent results. Conclusions: With death-adjusted competing risk analysis, HCV infection is associated with an increased risk of developing ESRD in CKD cohort. © 2014 Lee et al.

84904039763	P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration are associated with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease	P wave parameters measured by 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly used as a noninvasive tool to evaluate left atrial enlargement. This study was designed to assess whether P wave parameters were associated with renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This longitudinal study enrolled 439 patients with CKD stages 3-5. Renal end points were defined as the commencement of dialysis or death. Change in renal function was measured using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. We measured two ECG P wave parameters corrected for heart rate, i.e., corrected P wave dispersion and corrected maximum P wave duration. The values of P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were 88.8±21.7 ms and 153.3±21.7 ms, respectively. During the follow-up period (mean, 25.2 months), 95 patients (21.6%) started hemodialysis and 30 deaths (6.8%) were recorded. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified that increased P wave dispersion [hazard ratio (HR), 1.020; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.009-1.032; P<0.001] and maximum P wave duration (HR, 1.013; 95% CI, 1.003-1.024; P = 0.012) were associated with progression to renal end points. Furthermore, increased P wave dispersion (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.016; P = 0.037) and maximum P wave duration (unstandardized coefficient β = -0.014; P = 0.040) were negatively associated with the eGFR slope. We demonstrated that increased P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration were associated with progression to the renal end points of dialysis or death and faster renal function decline in CKD patients. Screening CKD patients on the basis of P wave dispersion and maximum P wave duration may help identify patients at high risk for worse renal outcomes. © 2014 Huang et al.

84910598666	Variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate by area under the curve predicts renal outcomes in chronic kidney disease	Greater variability in renal function is associated with mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few studies have demonstrated the predictive value of renal function variability in relation to renal outcomes. This study investigates the predictive ability of different methods of determining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) variability for progression to renal replacement therapy (RRT) in CKD patients. This was a prospective observational study, which enrolled 1,862 CKD patients. The renal end point was defined as commencement of RRT. The variability in eGFR was measured by the area under the eGFR curve (AUC)%. A significant improvement in model prediction was based on the -2 log likelihood ratio statistic. During a median 28.7-month follow-up, there were 564 (30.3%) patients receiving RRT. In an adjusted Cox model, a smaller initial eGFR AUC%-12M (P<0.001), a smaller peak eGFR AUC%-12M (P<0.001), and a larger negative eGFR slope-12M (P<0.001) were associated with a higher risk of renal end point. Two calculated formulas: initial eGFR AUC%-12M and eGFR slope-12M were the best predictors. Our results demonstrate that the greater eGFR variability by AUC% is associated with the higher risk of progression to RRT.

0347135859	Does amino acid-based peritoneal dialysate change homocysteine metabolism in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients?	◆ Objective: We examined whether amino acid-based peritoneal dialysate that contains 85 mg/dL L-methionine affects homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism. ◆ Design: The study enrolled 17 adult CAPD patients (11 men, 6 women) who had been receiving CAPD for at least 6 months and who had low serum albumin levels (<3.7 g/dL). Diet was not specifically changed. All of the study patients received daily 4-exchange CAPD treatment, and they used Nutrineal (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) as one of their daily exchanges (first or second exchange). Blood samples were collected every 2 weeks, and Hcy was measured. ◆ Results: After use of Nutrineal, serum albumin was unchanged, but blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and total protein were increased. Before the study began, 1 patient had a very high Hcy level (256 μmol/L); his data were excluded from the analysis. In the remaining 16 patients, baseline Hcy was 24.4 ± 7.0 μmol/L. Levels of Hcy progressively increased with the use of Nutrineal: 28.1 ± 6.2 μmol/L in week 2, 28.4 ± 7.1 μmol/L in week 4, 29.1 ± 7.6 μmol/L in week 6, 29.3 ± 9.0 μmol/L in week 8, 27.5±9.7 μmol/L in week 10, and 30.3 ± 8.2 μmol/L in week 12. ◆ Conclusions: Nutrineal might help to replenish daily protein loss, but it also increased formation of Hcy and, therefore, the potential risk of cardiovascular illness. Further studies will be needed to examine the effect of folic acid and vitamin B
