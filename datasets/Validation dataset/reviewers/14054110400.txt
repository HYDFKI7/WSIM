1642568676	Ataxia-Telangiectasia-Mutated (ATM) Gene in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Promoter Hypermethylation with Clinical Correlation in 100 Cases	The Ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene product is a well-characterized tumor suppressor that plays a key role in maintenance of genomic stability. We have recently documented that the ATM promoter is a target for epigenetic silencing in cultured tumor cells. Here we show that aberrant methylation of the ATM promoter occurs in a significant percentage (25%) of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. The presence of methylated ATM promoter shows a statistically significant correlation with an earlier age of initial diagnosis and decreased overall survival, particularly in early-stage tumors. These findings indicate that ATM promoter hypermethylation occurs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and this feature is a potentially useful prognostic marker in this tumor type.

19944428818	Anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G in healthcare workers, Guangzhou, China	To determine the prevalence of inapparent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) among healthcare workers, we performed a serosurvey to test for immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) among 1,147 healthcare workers in 3 hospitals that admitted SARS patients in mid-May 2003. Among them were 90 healthcare workers with SARS. As a reference group, 709 healthcare workers who worked in 2 hospitals that never admitted any SARS patients were similarly tested. The seroprevalence rate was 88.9% (80/90) for healthcare workers with SARS and 1.4% (15/1,057) for healthcare workers who were apparently healthy. The seroprevalence in the reference group was 0.4% (3/709). These findings suggest that inapparent infection is uncommon. Low level of immunity among unaffected healthcare workers reinforces the need for adequate personal protection and other infection control measures in hospitals to prevent future epidemics.

21344437267	Dietary fatty acids regulate cholesterol induction of liver CYP7α1 expression and bile acid production	In the present study we investigated the effects of dietary fats containing predominantly PUFA, monounsaturated FA (MUFA), or saturated FA (SFA) on lipid profile and liver cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7α1) mRNA expression and bile acid production in C57BL/6J mice. The animals (n = 75) were randomly divided into five groups and fed a basic chow diet (AIN-930 (BC diet), a chow diet with 1 g/100 g of cholesterol (Chol diet), a chow diet with 1 g/100 g of cholesterol and 14 g/100 g of safflower oil (Chol + PUFA diet), a chow diet with 1 g/100 g of cholesterol and olive oil (Chol + MUFA diet), or a chow diet with 1 g/100 g of cholesterol and myristic acid (Chol + SFA diet) for 6 wk. The results showed that the Chol + SFA diet decreased CYP7α1 gene expression and bile acid pool size, resulting in increased blood and liver cholesterol levels. Addition of PUFA and MUFA to a 1% cholesterol diet increased the bile acid pool production or bile acid excretion and simultaneously decreased liver cholesterol accumulation despite decreased CYP7α1 mRNA expression. The results indicate that the decreased bile acid pool size induced by the SFA diet is related to inhibition of the liver CYP7α1 gene expression, but an increased bile acid pool size and improved cholesterol homeostasis are disassociated from the liver CYP7α1 gene expression.

21344473678	Ox-LDL plays dual effect in modulating expression of inflammatory molecles through LOX-1 pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1) has been recognized to be the major endothelial receptor for oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Ox-LDL has been reported to induce the expression of inflammatory adhesive molecules from vascular endothelium. However, the mechanism of this action has not been fully elucidated. Peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) regulates the expression of inflammatory adhesive molecules. The present study was carried out to investigate the role of LOX-1-PPARgamma pathway in regulating expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs. Ox-LDL increased the expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in a concentration (10-50 microgram/ml)-and time (6-36 hours)-dependent manners. These effects were significantly inhibited by pretreatment of HUVECs with polyinosonic acid or carrageenan. Preincubating HUVECs with 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) attenuated the expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in response to ox-LDL, although ox-LDL stimulated the expression of PPARgamma. Upregulation of ICAM-1 and E-selectin mediated by ox-LDL were inhibited more significantly by the combination of 15d-PGJ2 and polyinosonic acid as compared to either 15d-PGJ2 or polyinosonic acid alone. The results suggested that ox-LDL through its receptor LOX-1 promotes pro-inflammation response by increasing expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin, simultaneously activates PPARgamma triggering cellular anti-inflammation response in protection from the inflammation lesions in HUVECs.

24944531829	Sequence analysis and structural prediction of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp5	The non-structural proteins (nsp or replicase proteins) of coronaviruses are relatively conserved and can be effective targets for drugs. Few studies have been conducted into the function of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp5. In this study, bioinformatics methods were employed to predict the secondary structure and construct 3-D models of the SARS-CoV GD strain nsp5. Sequencing and sequential comparison was performed to analyze the mutation trend of the polymerase nsp5 gene during the epidemic process using a nucleotide-nucleotide basic local alignment search tool (BLASTN) and a protein-protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTP). The results indicated that the nsp5 gene was steady during the epidemic process and the protein was homologous with other coronavirus nsp5 proteins. The protein encoded by the nsp5 gene was expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This study provided the foundation for further exploration of the protein's biological function, and contributed to the search for anti-SARS-CoV drugs. ©Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS.

27644524232	Area of atherosclerotic plaque in mice with apolipoprotein E genetic defect and serum level of anti-oxidized low density lipoproten antibody	Background: The oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key influencing factor in the occurrence and development process of atherosclerosis. How is the merit of the method for the detection of the level of anti-serum oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) antibody on the evaluation of atherosclerotic plaque? Objective: To study the method for the detection of serum anti-ox-LDL antibody in mice with apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) genetic defect to analyze the merits of serous level of anti-ox-LDL antibody on the evaluation of the area of atherosclerotic plaque in mice with Apo-E genetic defect. Design: Single factor analysis of variance (a case-controlled study). Setting: Laboratory of nutrition and metabolism diseases in a university. Participants: Mice with Apo-E genetic defect were grouped into positive group (series: C57B L/6J, n = 15), while normal mice were grouped into control group (series: C57BL/6J, n = 15). Interventions: Mice of two groups were fed in separate cage on laminar flow shelf for free drinking and eating. The venous blood was drawn from the orbit of mice after 16 weeks for the separation of mice serum. The level of anti-ox-LDL antibody was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the separated serum from either mice with Apo-E genetic defect or normal mice. The area of atherosclerotic plaque was measured by image analysis after oil red O staining. Main outcome measures: ox-LDL level and atherosclerotic plaque area in mice with Apo-E genetic defect or normal mice. Results: Anti-ox-LDL antibody level of mice with Apo-E genetic defect was[(0.079 ± 0.028)% ], which was significantly higher than [(0.012 ± 0.001)% ]of normal mice(F = 10.666, P < 0.01). The area of atherosclerotic plaque of mice with Apo-E genetic defect was (26.25 9.20)%, which was also significantly higher than 0% of normal mice, and moreover, there was a significant correlation between these two factors (r = 0.638, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Serum level of anti-ox-LDL antibody in mice with Apo-E genetic defect is closely correlated with the area of atherosclerotic plaque, which is an important indicator for the generation of atherosclerosis in mice with Apo-E genetic defect.

27744589607	Anthocyanins induce cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages: The role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-liver X receptor α-ABCA1 pathway	It is widely accepted that stimulation of reverse cholesterol transport, the efflux of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transferring it to the liver for biliary excretion, is becoming an important component in reducing excess cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic plaques. The ATP-binding cassette transporter has been identified as a key regulator of macrophage cholesterol efflux and apoAI-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. In vivo studies have documented anthocyanins, a large group of naturally phenolic compounds rich in plants, possess substantial capacities in improving plasma cholesterol levels. In this study, we investigated the potential role of anthocyanins in modulating cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and the possible molecular mechanism linking ABCA1 to cholesterol efflux. Incubation of the mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells with cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside and peonidin-3-O-β-glucoside led to dose-dependent (1-100 μM) induction in cholesterol efflux and ABCA1 mRNA expression, and this effect could be blocked by the ABCA1 inhibitor 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt, and a general inhibitor of gene transcription actinomycin D. Treatment of the macrophages with anthocyanins also activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, liver X receptor a mRNA expression, and their mediated gene expression. Addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt or GW9662 markedly inhibited the anthocyanin-induced increase of ABCA1 gene expression and apoAI-mediated cholesterol efflux. These data demonstrated that anthocyanin induces cholesterol efflux from mouse peritoneal macrophages and macrophage-derived foam cells and that stimulation of cholesterol efflux by anthocyanin is mediated, at least in part, by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-liver X receptor α-ABCA1 signaling pathway activation. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

33746652574	An anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice enhances atherosclerotic plaque stabilization in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice	Black rice and its pigment fraction may have antiatherogenic activity, but the exact component contributing to the beneficial effect remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice on the vulnerability of advanced plaques in apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice. Using LC-MS, the anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice was identified as containing cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside. ApoE-deficient mice (n = 30; 30 wk old) were randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group (fed the AIN-93G diet), the simvastin group [simva; fed the AIN-93G diet containing simvastatin, 50 mg/(kg·d)], or the anthocyanin-rich extract group [antho; fed the AIN-93G diet supplemented with anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice, 300 mg/(kg·d)]. After 20 wk of intervention, the plaque area that developed in the brachiocephalic artery of mice in the antho group was smaller than that of the control mice. Both the antho and simva groups had lower frequencies of the large necrotic core and thin fibrous cap in plaques than the control group. Collagen I was increased and matrix metalloproteinase-1 contents were reduced in the brachiocephalic lesion of both the antho and simva groups compared with the control group. Furthermore, mRNA levels of tissue factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase in aortae were decreased in the antho and simva groups. Supplementation of anthocyanin-rich extract improved the lipid profile by decreasing serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. These results suggest that chronic diet intake of anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice may enhance plaque stabilization in old apoE-deficient mice. The underlying mechanism is related mainly to inhibiting proinflammatory factors and improving the serum lipid profile. © 2006 American Society for Nutrition.

33846281164	Effects of anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice on the mRNA expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque	Aim: To establish the animal model of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque, and further explore the effects of anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice on the atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque and the expression of inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS). Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Department of Nutrition, Public Health School of Sun Yet-sen University between June 2004 and October 2006. The anthocyanin was extracted from black rice (Oryza sativa L.) produced by Guangzhou city in Guangdong Province. Its major contents were cyaniding-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside. A total of 48 ApoE-knock-out mice with an age of 4 weeks and an average body mass of (21±3) g on a C57BL/6J back ground were randomly divided into three groups: anthocyanin group (1 g/kg diet), simvastatin group (0.5 g/kg diet) and control group with 16 mice half in male and half in female in each group. All mice were fed in rack at 24 °C with free access to food and water. The uviol lamp was used every other day for the rack to maintain sterile environment. After 30 weeks, the mice were killed by cervical vertebrae dislocation under anesthesia. The innominate arteries were harvested after perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Hematoxylin-eosin dyeing was used for histological observation and the mRNA was extracted for detecting iNOS expression. Results: Totally 48 mice were involved in the analysis of results. 1 The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque characteristics such as calcification, thin fibrous cap and large lipid core in ApoE-knock-out mice fed with AIN-93 forage for 30weeks. 2 The number of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaques with thin fibrous cap and large lipid core (> 50%) decreased 57.38% and 53.13% in the anthocyanin group and 51.29% and 64.25% in the simvastatin group compared with those of the control group respectively. But there was no difference in the number of plaques with calcification between the three groups. 3 The iNOS mRNA expression in innominate arteries vulnerable plaque decreased by 39.26% and 45.82% respectively in the anthocyanin group and the simvastatin group compared with those of control group, whereas there was no difference between the anthocyanin group and simvastatin group. Conclusion: The ApoE-knock-out mice can be used as the animal models of atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. The anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice can promote the stability of vulnerable plaque in ApoE-knock-out mice, which may contributes to down-regulate the iNOS mRNA expression.

33846325514	Lysophosphatidylcholine promotes cholesterol efflux from mouse macrophage foam cells via PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1-dependent pathway associated with apoE	Formation of macrophage-derived foam cells is a hallmark in earlier stages of atherosclerosis (AS). Increased cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells promote atherosclerotic regression. In the present study, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells was observed, and the mechanism underlying the action was investigated. Macrophage foam cells from mice were incubated with different concentrations of LPC (10, 20,40, 80 μM), and the free cholesterol in medium increased but total intracellular cholesterol decreased. At the same time, the expression of PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1 was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner. The treatment of macrophage foam cells with 40 μM LPC for 12, 24 and 48 h promoted cellular cholesterol efflux in a time-dependent manner, meanwhile expression of PPARγ, LXRα, ABCA1 was also raised respectively. Addition of different specific inhibitors of PPARγ (GW9662), LXRα (GGPP), ABCA1 (DIDS) to the foam cells significantly suppressed LPC-induced cholesterol efflux. Also treatment with specific inhibitors of PPARγ or LXRα decreased ABCA1 mRNA and protein expressions. LPC (40 μM)-induced cholesterol efflux was significantly lower in macrophage foam cells from apoE deficient mice than from normal C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, 10 μg apoAI-induced cholesterol efflux from foam cells remained in apoE deficient mice. The present results indicate that LPC promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells via a PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1-dependent pathway. Furthermore, apoE may be involved in this process.

33847287825	Effect of anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) on hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in fructose-fed rats	This study was designed to evaluate the effect of an anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice on hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in fructose-fed rats. Rats fed fructose diet for 4 weeks exhibited significantly higher plasma insulin levels and lower insulin sensitivity than the control rats fed AIN-93G diet. Dietary supplementation with the anthocyanin-rich extract (5 g/kg of high-fructose diet) prevented the development of fructose-induced insulin resistance. After fructose-induced insulin resistance had been established, 4-week treatment with the anthocyanin-rich extract (5 g/kg of high-fructose diet) or pioglitazone (270 mg/kg of high-fructose diet) ameliorated the glucose intolerance and hyperlipidemia, but the extract failed to reverse the fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia as pioglitazone did. In addition, rats supplemented by the extract exhibited lower oxidative stress than the fructose-fed controls, as indicated by the lower concentrations of plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and blood oxidized glutathione. Overall, these results suggest that the anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice improves certain metabolic abnormalities associated with diets high in fructose. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

33847028751	Anthocyanin prevents CD40-activated proinflammatory signaling in endothelial cells by regulating cholesterol distribution	OBJECTIVE - Intracellular tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) translocation to lipid rafts is a key element in CD40-induced signaling. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of anthocyanin on CD40-mediated proinflammatory events in human endothelial cells and the underlying possible molecular mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS - Treatment of endothelial cells with anthocyanin prevented from CD40-induced proinflammatory status, measured by production of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 through inhibiting CD40-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. TRAF-2 played pivotal role in CD40-NF-κB pathway as TRAF-2 small interference RNA (siRNA) diminished CD40-induced NF-κB activation and inflammation. TRAF-2 overexpression increased CD40-mediated NF-κB activation. Moreover, TRAF-2 almost totally recruited to lipid rafts after stimulation by CD40 ligand and depletion of cholesterol diminished CD40-mediated NF-κB activation. Exposure to anthocyanin not only interrupted TRAF-2 recruitment to lipid rafts but also decreased cholesterol content in Triton X-100 insoluble lipid rafts. However, anthocyanin did not influence the interaction between CD40 ligand and CD40 receptor. CONCLUSIONS - Our findings suggest that anthocyanin protects from CD40-induced proinflammatory signaling by preventing TRAF-2 translocation to lipid rafts through regulation of cholesterol distribution, which thereby may represent a mechanism that would explain the anti-inflammatory response of anthocyanin. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

34047120286	Supplementation of black rice pigment fraction improves antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status in patients with coronary heart disease	Black rice and its pigment fraction have shown anti-atherogentic activities in several animal models, but whether their beneficial effects will recur in humans remains unknown. The aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of black rice pigment fraction (BRF) supplementation on selected cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Sixty patients with CHD aged 45 - 75 years were recruited from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, China and randomly divided into two groups. In the test group, the diet was supplemented with 10 grams of BRF derived from black rice for 6 months; While in the placebo group, the diet was supplemented with 10 grams of white rice pigment fraction (WRF) derived from white rice. At baseline, plasma antioxidant status and the levels of inflammatory biomarkers and other measured variables were similar between two groups. After 6 months' intervention, compared to WRF supplementation, BRF supplementation greatly enhanced plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (p=0.003), significantly reduce plasma levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) (p=0.03), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) (p=0.002) and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p=0.002) in the test group . No significant changes were observed in plasma total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity, lipids level and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) between two groups. These results may suggest that BRF could exert cardioprotective effects on patients with CHD by improving plasma antioxidant status and inhibiting inflammatory factors.

34547805308	Lipid rafts regulate cellular CD40 receptor localization in vascular endothelial cells	Cholesterol enriched lipid rafts are considered to function as platforms involved in the regulation of membrane receptor signaling complex through the clustering of signaling molecules. In this study, we tested whether these specialized membrane microdomains affect CD40 localization in vitro and in vivo. Here, we provide evidence that upon CD40 ligand stimulation, endogenous and exogenous CD40 receptor is rapidly mobilized into lipid rafts compared with unstimulated HAECs. Efficient binding between CD40L and CD40 receptor also increases amounts of CD40 protein levels in lipid rafts. Deficiency of intracellular conserved C terminus of the CD40 cytoplasmic tail impairs CD40 partitioning in raft. Raft disorganization after methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment diminishes CD40 localization into rafts. In vivo studies show that elevation of circulating cholesterol in high-cholesterol fed rabbits increases the cholesterol content and CD40 receptor localization in lipid rafts. These findings identify a physiological role for membrane lipid rafts as a critical regulator of CD40-mediated signal transduction and raise the possibility that certain pathologic conditions may be treated by altering CD40 signaling with drugs affecting its raft localization. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

34548359391	Modifiable family and school environmental factors associated with smoking status among adolescents in Guangzhou, China	Objective.: To identify modifiable family and school environmental factors associated with Chinese adolescent smoking behaviors including never-smoking, experimental smoking, regular smoking, and attempting to quit. Methods.: A cross-sectional survey using self-reported questionnaires was conducted in Huangpu, Guangzhou in December of 2004. A total of 3957 pupils agreed to complete the questionnaires. The prevalence odds ratio (risk) of experimental smoking was compared to never-smoking, adjusting for gender and age in unconditional logistic regression analysis. The risk of regular smoking was compared to experimental smoking, and the risk of attempting quitting was analyzed in regular smokers. Results.: The cigarette smoking of peers, mothers, fathers, brothers, and supervising teachers, passive smoking, and seeing someone smoking on campus increased the risk of experimental smoking vs. nonsmoking, while no-smoking signs, perceived anti-tobacco atmosphere in school, and being taught smoking-related health knowledge decreased the risk. The factors associated with regular smoking compared to experimental smoking included the smoking of peers, brothers, fathers and supervising teachers, teacher's tolerance, and passive smoking. Being taught smoking-related knowledge, perceived anti-tobacco atmosphere and no-smoking signs in school were positively associated with regular smoker's attempt to quit, while supervising teacher's smoking, parents' and teachers' tolerance could delay it. Conclusions.: These modifiable family and school environmental factors as well as their interaction with gender and age should be highly considered in adolescent smoking prevention in China. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

36248932667	Effect of medium chain triglyceride on blood lipids and free fatty acid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Objective: To observe the effect of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on body weight, blood lipids, and free fatty acids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: With total energy and fat consumption controlled, patients in MCT group were given 100% MCT oil, MCT/long chain triglyceride (LCT) group were given 50% MCT oil + 50% LCT oil, and LCT group were given 100% LCT oil. All patients were asked to take the test oil every day for 12 weeks. Body height and body weight, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apoprotein A1 (ApoA1), apoprotein B (ApoB) and free fatty acids were measured at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. Then body mass index (BMI), LDL/HDL, ApoA1/ApoB, long chain saturated fatty acid (LCSFA), unsaturated fatty acid (USFA), and total free fatty acid (TFFA) were analysized. Results: Compared with LCT group, body weight and BMI in MCT group and MCT/LCT group at 6 and 12 weeks significantly decreased (P < 0.05). Compared with LCT group, blood TC in MCT/LCT group at 12 weeks was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Compared with 0 week, blood LDL-C of 6 and 12 weeks in MCT/LCT group were significantly lower (P < 0.05). Compared with 6 weeks, blood LDL-C of 12 weeks in MCT group was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Compared with MCT group, blood HDL-C in LCT group at 12 weeks was significantly higher (P < 0.05). LCSFA in LCT group step up at 6 weeks and was significantly higher than that in MCT group (P < 0.05). No significant differences of TFFA and USFA were found among three groups. Conclusion: When the total energy and fat consumption is controlled, full or partial replacement of the daily diet oil with MCT may improve BMI and blood lipids without obvious changes of blood free fatty acids.

36349018375	Cystine-glutamate transporter SLC7A11 mediates resistance to geldanamycin but not to 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin	The cystine-glutamate transporter SLC7A11 has been implicated in chemoresistance, by supplying cystine to the cell for glutathione maintenance. In the NCI-60 cell panel, SLC7A11 expression shows negative correlation with growth inhibitory potency of geldanamycin but not with its analog 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), which differs in the C-17 substituent in that the the methoxy moiety of geldanamycin is replaced by an amino group. Structure and potency analysis classified 18 geldanamycin analogs into two subgroups, "17-O/H" (C-17 methoxy or unsubstituted) and "17-N" (C-17 amino), showing distinct SLC7A11 correlation. We used three 17-O/H analogs and four 17-N analogs to test the role of the 17-substituents in susceptibility to SLC7A11-mediated resistance. In A549 cells, which are resistant to geldanamycin and strongly express SLC7A11, inhibition of SLC7A11 by (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine or small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to 17-O/H, but had no effect on 17-N analogs. Ectopic expression of SLC7A11 in HepG2 cells, which are sensitive to geldanamycin and express low SLC7A11, confers resistance to geldanamycin, but not to 17-AAG. Antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, a precursor for glutathione synthesis, completely suppressed cytotoxic effects of 17-O/H but had no effect on 17-N analogs, whereas the prooxidant ascorbic acid had the opposite effect. Compared with 17-AAG, geldanamycin led to significantly more intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which was quenched by addition of N-acetylcysteine. We conclude that SLC7A11 confers resistance selectively to 17-O/H (e.g., geldanamycin) but not to 17-N (e.g., 17-AAG) analogs partly as a result of differential dependence on ROS for cytotoxicity. Distinct mechanisms could significantly affect antitumor response and organ toxicity of these compounds in vivo.

37549063031	Differences in students' smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among public, factory, and private secondary schools in Guangzhou, China: Research article	The prevalence of smoking among Chinese adolescents has dramatically increased in recent years. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among Chinese students in 3 types of secondary schools. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 3957 students of seventh, eighth, and ninth grades and 2870 student parents from 3 public, 1 factory, and 2 general-paid private secondary schools at Guangzhou in 2004. Participants were asked to complete self-administered questionnaires about sociodemographic characteristics, smoking-related family and school environments, smoking-related knowledge and attitudes, and smoking behaviors. The average scores of students' smoking-related knowledge and attitudes (higher score, more against smoking) were highest in the factory school, followed by public schools and private schools. The differences among them were statistically significantly (P <.05). The lifetime smoking prevalence was also significantly different (P <.001) among 3 types of schools: 35.4% in private schools, 17.4% in public schools, and 13.2% in the factory school. The prevalence of students' weekly smoking was also higher in private schools (6.2%) than in public schools (4.9%) or the factory school (4.0%). Similar disparity was observed in the prevalence of daily smoking (3.9% private, 3.5% public, and 2.7% factory). However, differences in weekly and daily smoking were not statistically significant (P >.05). Compared with students in public and factory schools, those in general-paid private schools had poorer smoking-related knowledge, more supportive attitudes toward smoking, and more popular smoking behaviors. Therefore, more intensive smoking prevention programs should be implemented among them. © 2008, American School Health Association.

38149140159	A variant of the Cockayne syndrome B gene ERCC6 confers risk of lung cancer	Cockayne syndrome B protein (ERCC6) plays an essential role in DNA repair. However, the Cockayne syndrome caused by the ERCC6 defect has not been linked to cancer predisposition; likely due to the fact that cells with severe disruption of the ERCC6 function are sensitive to lesion-induced apoptosis, thus reducing the chance of tumorigenesis. The biological function and cancer susceptibility of a common variant rs3793784:C>G (c.-6530C>G) in the ERCC6 was examined. We show that the c.-6530C allele has lower binding affinity of Sp1 by EMSA and displays a lower transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo. We then examined the contribution of this polymorphism to the risk of lung cancer in a case-control study with 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The case-control analysis revealed a 1.76-fold (P = × 10

To investigate which, if either, of these compounds is more closely related to atherosclerosis, we fed 5 groups of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice different diets for 8 wk to induce changes in their plasma Hcy and AdoHcy concentrations. These included an AIN-93G control diet (C), this C diet supplemented with methionine (M), the M diet deficient in folates, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 (M2V), this M diet supplemented with these B vitamins (M1V), and a C diet deficient in B vitamins (C2V). Compared with controls, mice fed the C2V diet had a moderate elevation in their plasma total Hcy (tHcy) levels; however, their plasma AdoHcy concentration and atherosclerotic lesion areas were not different. In contrast, the mice fed the M+V diet had larger atherosclerotic lesion areas and elevated plasma AdoHcy concentrations but their plasma tHcy concentration did not differ from that of the group C mice. The plasma AdoHcy concentration and aortic sinus lesion areas were positively correlated (r = 0.866; P < 0.001). We observed a negative correlation between the plasma AdoHcy concentration and both the DNA methyltransferase activity (r = 20.792; P < 0.001) and global DNA methylation status (r = 20.824; P < 0.001) in the aortic tissue. Hence, our study suggests that plasma AdoHcy is a better biomarker of atherosclerosis than Hcy and may accelerate the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apoE-deficient mice that have been fed a high methionine diet. The mechanisms underlying this effect may be related to the AdoHcy-mediated inhibition of DNA methylation in the aortic tissue. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.

33344459071	Globular adiponectin decreases leptin-induced tumor necrosis factor-α expression by murine macrophages: Involvement of cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways	Several lines of evidence have supported a link between obesity and inflammation. The present study investigated the capacity of leptin and globular adiponectin to affect tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production in murine peritoneal macrophages. Leptin stimulated TNF-α production at mRNA as well as protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Intracellular cAMP concentration was increased and protein kinase A (PKA) was activated with the treatment of leptin, subsequently downstream MAPK signal proteins, ERK1/2 and p38, were phosphorylated. Specific inhibitors for the signal proteins, Rp cAMPS, H89, PD98059, and U0126, or SB203580, suppressed the signaling pathway and TNF-α expression. Although gAd partially increased cAMP concentration and PKA activity, it directly reduced leptin-induced ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation thus inhibiting TNF-α production. In conclusion, leptin promotes inflammation by stimulating TNF-α production, which is mediated by cAMP-PKA-ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways. gAd inhibited leptin-induced TNF-α production through suppressing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

58749093769	Potential infections of H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza do exist in Guangdong populations of China	Background: Southeast China is one of the sites of influenza origin. During 2003-2004, nine avian influenza outbreaks took place in Guangdong Province. But no human case was reported. To examine the status of potential human infection by human influenza (H1N1, H3N2) and avian influenza (H5N1, H7N7, H9N2) in the avian influenza epidemic area of Guangdong Province, China, we conducted a seroepidemiologic survey in the people of this area from April to June of 2004. Methods: Three out of 9 H5N1 avian influenza affected poultry areas in Guangdong were randomly selected, and the population living within 3 kilometers of the affected poultries were chosen as the survey subjects. One thousand two hundred and fourteen people were selected from 3 villages at random. Human and avian influenza antibody titers were determined by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and microneutralization test (MNT). Results: The positive rate of antibody to H5N1 was 3.03% in the occupational exposure group and 2.34% in general citizens group; that of H9N2 was 9.52% in the occupational exposure group and 3.76% in the general citizens group. Moreover one case in the occupational exposure group was positive for H7N7. One year later, all previously positive cases had become negative except for one H5N1-positive case. Conclusion: The observations imply that H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza silent infections exist in Guangdong populations.

84861507757	Effects of medium chain triglyceride on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus	Objective: To observe the effects of medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: With long chain triglyceride (LCT) as control, patients were divided into three groups based on their oil intakes; MCT group (100% MCT oil), MCT/LCT group (50% MCT oil + 50% LCT oil), and LCT group (100% LCT oil). Oils were taken daily for 3 months. The total energy and fat consumptions were controlled. The blood levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting plasma insulin (FIN), C-peptide (CP), resistin, and beta hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) at Months 0, 1.5, and 3 were measured. The mRNA express of resistin in peripheral blood mononuclear cell was also detected. Afterwards the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were analyzed. Results: Compared with baseline level, FPG significantly decreased at Month 1.5 in MCT group (P = 0.042) and FIN significantly decreased at Month 3 in MCT/LCT group (P = 0.005). Compared with LCT group, FIN significantly decreased in MCT/LCT group at both Month 1.5 and 3 (P = 0.033, P = 0.006); FIN also significantly decreased in MCT group at Month 1.5 (P = 0.020). Compared with baseline level, C-peptide significantly increased in MCT group at both Month 1.5 and 3 (P < 0.001), and also increased in MCT/LCT group at Month 3 (P = 0.024). Compared with baseline level, HOMA-IR significantly decreased in MCT/LCT group at Month 3 (P = 0.021) compared with LCT group, HOMA-IR significantly decreased at Month 1.5 in both MCT/LCT and MCT groups (P = 0.033, P = 0.017). Compared with LCT group, QUICKI significandy increased in MCT/LCT group at Month 3 (P = 0.011). BHBA was not significantly different at Month 1.5 and 3 (P = 0.617, P = 0.453). Conclusion: With total energy and fat consumptions controlled, replacement of 50% dietary oil with MCT can improve insulin resistance.

84877877562	Association of Weight-Adjusted Body Fat and Fat Distribution with Bone Mineral Density in Middle-Aged Chinese Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study	Background:Although it is well established that a higher body weight is protective against osteoporosis, the effects of body fat and fat distribution on bone mineral density (BMD) after adjustment for body weight remains uncertain.Objective:To examine the relationship between body fat and fat distribution and BMD beyond its weight-bearing effect in middle-aged Chinese adults.Method:The study had a community-based cross-sectional design and involved 1,767 women and 698 men aged 50-75 years. The BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip, and whole body, and the fat mass (FM) and percentage fat mass (%FM) of the total body and segments of the body were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. General information on the participants was collected using structured questionnaire interviews.Result:After adjusting for potential confounders, an analysis of covariance showed the weight-adjusted (WA-) total FM (or %FM) to be negatively associated with BMD in all of the studied sites (P<0.05) in both women and men. The unfavorable effects of WA-total FM were generally more substantial in men than in women, and the whole body was the most sensitive site related to FM, followed by the total hip and the lumbar spine, in both genders. The mean BMD of the lumbar spine, total hip, and whole body was 3.93%, 3.01%, and 3.65% (in women) and 5.02%, 5.57%, 6.03% (in men) lower in the highest quartile (vs. lowest quartile) according to the WA-total FM (all p<0.05). Similar results were noted among the groups for WA-total FM%. In women, abdominal fat had the most unfavorable association with BMD, whereas in men it was limb fat.Conclusion:FM (or %FM) is inversely associated with BMD beyond its weight-bearing effect. Abdominal fat in women and limb fat in men seems to have the greatest effect on BMD. © 2013 Liu et al.

84887632832	Higher homocysteine and lower betaine increase the risk of microangiopathy in patients with diabetes mellitus carrying the GG genotype of PEMT G774C	Background: Diabetes represents one of the greatest medical and socioeconomic threats worldwide. The pathogenesis involved is complicated. The effect of methyl donors and genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes on the risk of microangiopathy in patients with diabetes is not well understood. This study investigates the association of homocysteine, choline and betaine levels and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) G774C (rs12325817) genotypes with the risk of diabetes and its related microangiopathic complications. Methods: Between January 2009 and June 2010, 184 diabetic patients and 188 non-diabetic control subjects were enrolled in the hospital-based case-control study. Serum concentrations of betaine and choline were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometry. Serum concentrations of homocysteine were assayed using HPLC. PEMT gene mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, serum total homocysteine had a significant dose-dependent positive association, and serum choline had an inverse association with the risks of diabetes and its microangiopathic complications (both p<0.001). Although serum betaine was not associated with the risk of diabetes, it had a significant inverse association with diabetic microangiopathy. Compared with GG genotype, the CC genotype of PEMT G774C was associated with a decreased risk of diabetes (OR 0.559, 95% CI 0.338, 0.926) and its microangiopathy (OR 0.452, 95% CI 0.218, 0.937). Conclusion: The GG genotype of the PEMT G774C polymorphism, higher levels of serum homocysteine and lower levels of serum betaine are associated with an increased risk of microangiopathy in patients with diabetes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84908540569	Plant food anthocyanins inhibit platelet granule secretion in hypercholesterolaemia: Involving the signalling pathway of PI3K–Akt	Controlling platelet granule secretion has been considered an effective strategy to dampen thrombosis and prevent atherosclerosis. Anthocyanins are natural plant pigments and possess a wide range of biological activities, including cardiovascular protective activity. In the present study we explored the effects and the potential mechanisms of anthocyanins on platelet granule secretion in hypercholesterolemia. In a randomised, double-blind clinical trial, 150 hypercholesterolaemic individuals were treated with purified anthocyanins (320 mg/ day) or placebo for 24 weeks. Anthocyanins consumption significantly reduced plasma levels of β-thromboglobulin (β-TG), soluble P-selectin, and of Regulated on Activation Normal T cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) as compared with the placebo. A minor reduction in platelet factor 4 (PF4) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) levels were also observed. In in vitro experiments, we observed that purified anthocyanin mixture, as well as its two main anthocyanin components, delphinidin-3-glucoside (Dp-3-g) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (Cy-3g) directly inhibited platelet á-granule, dense granule, and lysosome secretion evaluated by P-selectin, RANTES, β-TG, PF4, TGF-β1, serotonin, ATP, and CD63 release. Further, anthocyanins inhibited platelet PI3K/Akt activation and consequently attenuated eNOS phosphorylation and cGMP production, thus interrupting MAPK activation. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, did not cause additional inhibitory efficacy, indicating that anthocyanin-induced effects may be involved in inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. These results provide evidence that by inhibiting platelet granule secretion, anthocyanins may be a potent cardioprotective agent.

84908199194	The role of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 and glucose transporter 2 in the absorption of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside in caco-2 cells	Anthocyanins have multiple biological activities of benefit to human health. While a few studies have been conducted to evaluate the bioavailability of anthocyanins, the mechanisms of their absorption mechanism remain ill-defined. In the present study, we investigated the absorption mechanism of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-G) in human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. Cy-3-G transport was assessed by measuring the absorptive and efflux direction. Inhibition studies were conducted using the pharmacological agents, phloridzin, an inhibitor of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1), or phloretin, an inhibitor of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2). The results showed that phloridzin and phloretin significantly inhibited the absorption of Cy-3-G. In addition, Caco-2 cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for SGLT1 or GLUT2 showed significantly decreased Cy-3-G absorption. These siRNA transfected cells also showed a significantly decreased rate of transport of Cy-3-G compared with the control group. These findings suggest that Cy-3-G absorption is dependent on the activities of SGLT1 and GLUT2 in the small intestine and that SGLT1 and GLUT2 could be a limiting step for the bioavailability of Cy-3-G.

84908549432	Soy food consumption, cardiometabolic alterations and carotid intima-media thickness in Chinese adults	Background and aim: The associations between soy food consumption, cardiometabolic disturbances and subclinical atherosclerosis remain controversial due to limited evidence. We examined the associations of habitual soy food consumption with cardiometabolic disturbances and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). Methods and results: We included 2939 subjects (2135 women and 804 men) aged 50-75 years in this community-based cross-sectional study. Dietary data and other covariates were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires. We determined CIMT in relation to each subject's common carotid artery, internal carotid artery, carotid bifurcation, blood lipids, glucose and urine acid, blood pressure and waist circumference. A logistic regression model was applied to estimate the odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and linear regression was used to estimate the regression coefficient and 95% CIs. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that greater consumption of soy protein (6.1 vs. 0.5g/d) was inverse associated with the presence of elevated total cholesterol (TC), dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity and hyperuricemia in women, and with abdominal obesity in men, although no significant sex-soy interactions were observed ( P: 0.145-0.985). The consumption of soy protein and isoflavones was inversely associated with the number of cardiometabolic disturbances among women, but not men. There were no significant associations of soy protein and isoflavones with CIMT thickening and other cardiometabolic disturbances. Conclusion: Greater soy consumption was associated with a lower presence of elevated TC, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and less number of cardiometabolic disturbances components in women.

47649120373	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside inhibits iNOS and COX-2 expression by inducing liver X receptor alpha activation in THP-1 macrophages	Anthocyanins belong to a large and widespread group of water-soluble phytochemicals and exhibit potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties; however, the molecular mechanisms of these biochemical actions mediated by anthocyanins remain unclear. In this study, our data show that pretreatment of THP-1 macrophages with Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (C3G) for 12 h can enhance the expression and transcriptional activities of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and liver X receptor α (LXRα). Furthermore, pretreatment of these cells with C3G for 12 h causes dose-dependent inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at both the mRNA and protein levels together with a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E

4944266177	Culture, identification and morphologic observation of endothelial cells from human unbilical vein in vitro	Aim: To establish the model of human vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to provide important experimental method for the pathogenesis research of atherosclerosis in vitro. Methods: ECs in umbilical vein were digested separated and subcultured with 1.25 g/L trypsin, (2.5 g/L trypsin: 0.2 g/L EDTA = 1: 1V/V). And morphologic observation and evaluation of ECs were made with light microscopy, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Results: The primary cultured ECs started to grow attaching to flask about 2 hours after inoculating. The ECs arrayed like pitching stone under light microscopy; VIII factor in the ECs showed positive reaction by immunohistochemistry; W-P corpuscles was in the cell plasm under electron-microscopy, which were identified as ECs. Conclusion: High purity EC can be harvested with digestion of pancreatin perfusion with high survival rate. This method provides experimental model for vascular EC research.

57649221326	Anthocyanin attenuates CD40-mediated endothelial cell activation and apoptosis by inhibiting CD40-induced MAPK activation	CD40-mediated inflammatory signaling is a potent activator of endothelial cells (ECs) and effective in triggering the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease. Anthocyanin is considered to exert potent cardiovascular-protective effect partially through its anti-inflammatory property, however, the precise mechanism is still unknown. Here we chose cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to explore the influence of anthocyanin on CD40-mediated endothelial activation and apoptosis and the underlying mechanism. Stimulation of human primary HUVECs by CD40 with its physiological ligand CD40L not only augmented MMP-1, -9 secretion and promoted MMP-1, -9 activities, but also induced endothelial cell apoptosis and death. Treatment of ECs with anthocyanins cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-g) and peonidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Pn-3-g) prevents CD40-induced endothelial activation by inhibiting production of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In addition, exposure to anthocyanins inhibits CD40-induced endothelial apoptosis. Anthocyanins also decreased activation of JNK and p38 induced by CD40. Collectively, our findings suggested that the inhibition of JNK and p38 activation interrupts CD40 induced endothelial cell activation and apoptosis, which thereby may represent a mechanism that would explain the anti-inflammatory response of anthocyanin and its athero-protective function. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

62349089818	Beneficial effects of designed dietary fatty acid compositions on lipids in triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins among Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus	Elevated levels of postprandial triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (ppTRLs) are atherogenic. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have exaggerated postprandial lipemia associated with elevation or prolonged residence of ppTRL remnants. We examined whether dietary fatty acid compositions (DFACs) decrease atherogenic lipid profiles in ppTRL subfractions in T2DM Chinese patients. A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted among 28 T2DM patients. Patients consumed 1 of 3 standardized DFAC-specific fat meals: equidominant (1:1:1), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-dominant (PUFA-D, 1:1.7:2.3), or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-dominant (MUFA-D, 1:1.7:1.2) meals.

64249151144	Which preventive measures might protect health care workers from SARS?	Background. Despite the use of a series of preventive measures, a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was observed among health care workers (HCWs) during the SARS epidemic. This study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective. Methods. A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the "case group" and the "control group", and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. Results. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases. Conclusion. Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimizing or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.

67650888885	Betaine supplementation attenuates atherosclerotic lesion in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice	Background Betaine serves as a methyl donor in a reaction converting homocysteine to methionine. It is commonly used for the treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia in humans, which indicates it may be associated with reduced risk of atherosclerosis. However, there have been few data regarding its vascular effect. Aim of the study To investigate the effect of betaine supplementation on atherosclerotic lesion in apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice. Methods Four groups of apoE-deficient mice were fed AIN-93G diets supplemented with 0, 1, 2, or 4 g betaine/100 g diet (no, 1, 2, and 4% betaine, respectively). Wild-type C57BL/6 J mice were fed AIN-93G diet (wild-type). Mice were sacrificed after 0, 7, or 14 weeks of the experimental diets. Atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic sinus, levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 in aorta and serum, serum lipids, and methylation status of TNF-α promoter in aorta were determined. Results Linear regression analysis showed that the higher dose of betaine was related to smaller atherosclerotic lesion area (β = -11.834, P < 0.001). Compared with no-betaine mice after 14 weeks, mice receiving 1%, 2%, or 4% betaine had 10.8, 41, and 37% smaller lesion area, respectively. Betaine supplementation also reduced aortic expression of TNF-α in a dose-dependent way in four groups of apoE-deficient mice, and Pearson correlation revealed that atherosclerotic lesion area was positively associated with aortic TNF-α level (r = 0.777, P < 0.001). Although serum TNF-α levels were lower in betaine-supplemented mice than in no-betaine mice after fourteen weeks of treatment (P < 0.001), we did not observe a significant dosage effect (P = 0.11). However, methylation level of TNF-α promoter did not differ among groups at any time. In this study, apoE-deficient mice receiving betaine supplementation for 14 weeks had higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol (P < 0.01), LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05), and lower body weight (P < 0.05) than no-betaine mice. Conclusions These data suggest that despite exacerbating hyperlipidemia in apoE-deficient mice, betaine may exert its anti-atherogenic effect by inhibiting aortic inflammatory response mediated by TNF-α. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

68749108412	Behavioural development of school-aged children who live around a multi-metal sulphide mine in Guangdong province, China: A cross-sectional study	Background. The deleterious biological effects of low-level, long-term exposure to heavy metals are well known, and children are the most susceptible population. Dabaoshan Mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province is at high risk of discharging multi-metals pollutants into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. The present study aimed to estimate relationships between measured multi-metal exposures and the presence of behavioural problems for the school-aged children in the polluted area. Methods. A cross-sectional study was performed. Children aged 7-16 years living in three villages of the Hengshihe area with different degrees of heavy-metal pollution participated in this study. Local environmental samples (water and crops) and children's hair were collected, and concentrations of heavy metals were determined. The Child Behaviour Check-list (CBCL) was used to assess the presence of behaviour problems. General linear regression was used to analyze the contribution of hair metals to each CBCL subscale with adjustment for socio-demographic confounding factors. Results. Multiple regression analyses revealed significant effects of hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels on CBCL subscales. Log-transformed hair lead, cadmium and zinc levels accounted for an incremental of 8% to 15% variance in anxious/depressed, withdrawn, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behaviour and aggressive behaviour. The concurrent log-transformed hair lead and zinc levels were strongly associated with all subscales while the concurrent log-transformed hair cadmium was only significantly associated with withdrawn, social problems and attention problems. Conclusion. This study reveals that heavy metal exposure was associated with increased risk of behavioral problems for school-aged children. © 2009 Bao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

69849095827	Assessment of the effect of betaine on p16 and c-myc DNA methylation and mRNA expression in a chemical induced rat liver cancer model	Background: The development and progression of liver cancer may involve abnormal changes in DNA methylation, which lead to the activation of certain proto-oncogenes, such as c-myc, as well as the inactivation of certain tumor suppressors, such as p16. Betaine, as an active methyl-donor, maintains normal DNA methylation patterns. However, there are few investigations on the protective effect of betaine in hepatocarcinogenesis. Methods: Four groups of rats were given diethylinitrosamine (DEN) and fed with AIN-93G diets supplemented with 0, 10, 20 or 40 g betaine/kg (model, 1%, 2%, and 4% betaine, respectively), while the control group, received no DEN, fed with AIN-93G diet. Eight or 15 weeks later, the expression of p16 and c-myc mRNA was examined by Real-time PCR (Q-PCR). The DNA methylation status within the p16 and c-myc promoter was analyzed using methylation-specific PCR. Results: Compared with the model group, numbers and areas of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-p)-positive foci were decreased in the livers of the rats treated with betaine (P < 0.05). Although the frequency of p16 promoter methylation in livers of the four DEN-fed groups appeared to increase, there is no difference among these groups after 8 or 15 weeks (P < 0.05). Betaine supplementation attenuated the down-regulation of p16 and inhibited the up-regulation of c-myc induced by DEN in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, increases in levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in model, 2% and 4% betaine groups were observed (P < 0.05). Finally, enhanced antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) was observed in both the 2% and 4% betaine groups. Conclusion: Our data suggest that betaine attenuates DEN-induced damage in rat liver and reverses DEN-induced changes in mRNA levels. © 2009 Du et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

70349574630	Anthocyanin supplementation improves serum LDL- and HDL-cholesterol concentrations associated with the inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein in dyslipidemic subjects	Background: Anthocyanins have been shown to exert benefits on the lipid profile in many animal models. Whether these molecules have similar beneficial effects in humans is currently unknown. Objective: The objective was to investigate the effects of berry-derived anthocyanin supplements on the serum lipid profile in dyslipidemic patients. Design: A total of 120 dyslipidemic subjects (age 40-65 y) were given 160 mg anthocyanins twice daily or placebo for 12 wk in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Results: Anthocyanin consumption increased HDL-cholesterol concentrations (13.7% and 2.8% in the anthocyanin and placebo groups, respectively; P < 0.001) and decreased LDL-cholesterol concentrations (13.6% and -0.6% in the anthocyanin and placebo groups, respectively; P < 0.001). Cellular cholesterol efflux to serum increased more in the anthocyanin group than in the placebo group (20.0% and 0.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). Anthocyanin supplementation decreased the mass and activity of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) (10.4% and 6.3%, respectively, in the anthocyanin group and 23.5% and 1.1%, respectively, in the placebo group; P < 0.001).

70749083231	Coffee consumption and risk of coronary heart diseases: A meta-analysis of 21 prospective cohort studies	Background: A large amount of cohort studies addressed coffee consumption and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the pooling effects. Methods: We searched for all published English articles indexed in MEDLINE or PubMed from January 1966 to January 2008. Twenty-one independent prospective cohort studies, which tested CHD risk by coffee consumption, were identified. A general variance-based method was used to pool the relative risks (RR). 15,599 cases from 407,806 participants were included in pooling the overall effects. Results: As compared to the light coffee consumption (< 1 cup/d in US or ≤ 2 cups/d in Europe), under the random-effects model, the pooled CHD RRs (95% CI) for all studies combined were 0.96 (0.87-1.06), 1.04 (0.92-1.17) and 1.07 (0.87-1.32) for the moderate (1-3 or 3-4 cups/d), heavy (4-5 or 5-6 cups/d) and very heavy (≥ 6 or ≥ 7 cups/d) categories of coffee consumption (all p > 0.05); Moderate coffee consumption showed significantly lower CHD RR (95% CI) of 0.82 (0.73-0.92) (p < 0.001) in women, and of 0.87 (0.80-0.86) (p = 0.001) in men and women followed ≤ 10 years. Conclusion: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that coffee consumption increases the long-term risk of coronary heart disease. Habitual moderate coffee drinking was associated with a lower risk of CHD in women. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

71349085097	Delphinidin attenuates stress injury induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Moderate consumption of natural dietary polyphenolic compounds can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Here we investigated the protective effects of delphinidin against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The MTT assay showed that 2 h pre-incubation with delphinidin markedly restored the oxLDL-induced viability loss in HUVECs in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied by a significant decrease in intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, delphinidin imposed preventive effects on suppressing the production of lipid peroxidation, restoring the activities of endogenous antioxidants, and increasing the level of nitric oxide. Pre-incubation of delphinidin with HUVECs led to the reduction of apoptosis. Finally, delphinidin can efficiently prevent the down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein and up-regulation of Bax protein. Together, our findings suggest that delphinidin can effectively protect HUVECs against oxidative stress induced by oxLDL, which may be important for preventing both plaque development and stability in atherosclerosis. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

71449125760	Relationship of impairment induced by intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine accumulation with DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with 3-deazaadenosine	The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship of endothelial dysfunction induced by intracellular S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) accumulation and DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The isolated HUVEC were incubated with 3-deazaadenosine (DZA) to induce experimental intracellular SAH accumulation. The impairment of HUVEC function was assessed by changes in morphology and proliferative ability. The expression of DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) and the atherosclerosis related genes [oestrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α), extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] were analysed using quantitative real-time PCR. Global DNA methylated status was measured using the cytosine extension assay. The methylated patterns of ER-α, EC-SOD and MCP-1 genes were determined with methylation-specific PCR. We found that DZA administration increased intracellular SAH levels progressively and simultaneously decreased Hcy content in medium. Moreover, the supplementation induced HUVEC apoptosis, inhibited proliferation ability and DNMT1 mRNA expression (P < 0.05) and furthermore reduced global DNA methylation status (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis showed the presence of a negative correlation between intracellular SAH concentration, proliferative ability, and expression of ER-α, EC-SOD, and DNMT1 (r = -0.89, -0.86, -0.92 and -0.88 respectively, P < 0.001); and a positive correlation with MCP-1 expression and DNA [

74449085387	Structural requirements of anthocyanins in relation to inhibition of endothelial injury induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein and correlation with radical scavenging activity	Anthocyanins may play an important role in atherosclerosis prevention. However, the structure-function relationships are not well understood. The objective of this study was to compare the inhibitory effect of 21 anthocyanins against oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced endothelial injury to understand the relationship between anthocyanin chemical structure and the endothelial protective properties, measured as cell viability, MDA production and NO release. Additionally, the intracellular anti-radical activity of the selected anthocyanins was investigated to identify the correlation with endothelial protection. Our results provide evidence that the number of -OH in total or in B-ring, 3′,4′-ortho-dihydroxyl and 3-hydroxyl are the main structural requirements of anthocyanins in suppressing oxidative stress-induced endothelial injury and such inhibitory effect was significantly correlated with the intracellular radical scavenging activity. © 2009 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

74749096874	Phosphoinositide 3-kinase mediates CD40 ligand-induced oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction via Rac1 and NADPH oxidase 2	Objectives: CD40 ligand (CD40L) has been implicated as an inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in endothelial cells, but definitive evidence for this and the in vivo relevance haves not been demonstrated fully. We thus investigated whether phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was linked to ROS generation and endothelial reactivity in response to CD40L. Methods and Results: CD40L treatment activated PI3K activity by regulating the association between PI3K p85 and the CD40 receptor. CD40L exposure also stimulated the GTPase Rac1, which is known to activate NADPH oxidases, and enhanced ROS formation, whereas PI3K inhibition or depletion by small interfering RNA (siRNA) prevented these responses. Subsequently, PI3K overexpression activated Rac1 and increased ROS generation. These responses were not observed in the presence of inactive Rac1 or siRNA against the NADPH oxidase subunit NOX2. Protein kinase Cζ mediates PI3K-regulated NADPH oxidase activation by promoting cellular p47phox translocation. Importantly, PI3K inhibition prevented CD40L-mediated ROS generation and endothelial dysfunction in a mouse model. In summary, PI3K mediates CD40L-induced ROS production and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. Conclusions: Targeting PI3K may provide a new therapeutic approach in diseases associated with oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. © 2009 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

77649223536	Early C-reactive protein in the prediction of long-term outcomes after acute coronary syndromes: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies	Objective: To assess the overall effects by a meta-analysis. Data sources: Electronic searches on PubMed and Ovid Medline from their start to October 2009 were carried out. Objective: Cohort studies and secondary analysis of randomised controlled trials reporting the relative risk (RR) of recurrent cardiovascular events or death associated with C-reactive protein (CRP) obtained within 72 h from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) onset. Data extraction: Two epidemiologists independently abstracted information on study design, study and participant characteristics, level of CRP, outcomes, control for potential confounding factors and risk estimates using a standardised form. Results: A general variance-based method was used to pool the estimates of risk. Thirteen studies containing 1364 new cases identified from 9787 patients during the follow-up periods reported the risk estimates by CRP categories. Compared with the bottom CRP category (≤3 mg/l), the pooled RRs and their 95% CIs were 1.40 (1.18 to 1.67) for the middle (3.1∼10 mg/l) category and 2.18 (1.77 to 2.68) for the top (>10 mg/l) category of CRP values with a random-effects model, respectively. Another four and three studies reported the risk by unit of CRP or logarithmically transformed CRP. The pooled RRs (95% CI) were 1.49 (1.06 to 2.08) per 5 mg/l and 1.26 (0.95 to 1.69) per natural logarithm of CRP (mg/l), respectively. Conclusions: Greater early blood CRP moderately increases long-term risk of recurrent cardiovascular events or death, and may be a valuable prognostic predictor in patients after ACS.

77949270779	Lycopene suppresses LPS-induced NO and IL-6 production by inhibiting the activation of ERK, p38MAPK, and NF-κB in macrophages	Background: Lycopene has antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory effects with molecular mechanisms not fully identified. Aim and methods: We investigated the effects of lycopene on the inflammatory responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 cells and the signal transduction pathways involved. Results: Lycopene inhibited LPS-induced production of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with decreased mRNAs of inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-6 but had no effect on TNF-α. Further study showed that lycopene also inhibited LPS-induced IκB phosphorylation, IκB degradation, and NF-κB translocation. Moreover, lycopene blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase but not c-Jun NH

77952569191	Structurally related anticancer activity of flavonoids: Involvement of reactive oxygen species generation	The cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction effect of 23 flavonoids on human leukemia cells (HL-60) were investigated. 3,6-Dihydroxyflavone, luteolin and geraldol showed the most potent cytotoxic effect. By comparing the cytotoxicity of selected molecules that differ in only one structure element, we identified several structural properties important for potent cytotoxic activity, including the presence of 2,3-double bond, appropriate hydroxyl numbers, 3-OH and ortho-OH in ring B. Flavonoids with a 5-OH exhibited lower cytotoxicity than their counterparts. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection showed that 3,6-dihydroxyflavone, luteolin and geraldol all caused ROS generation. Addition of antioxidant N. -acetylcysteine prevented the elevation of ROS induced by the three flavonoids and partially suppressed their cytotoxic effects. It implied that pro-oxidation was involved in the apoptotic response, and ROS generation plays an important role in the antitumor effect of flavonoids. © 2010, The Author(s).

77953428336	Changes in the level of reactive oxygen species in leukemia HL-60 cells during apoptosis induced by flavonoids	Objective: To observe the changes in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in leukemia HL-60 cells during flavonoids-induced apoptosis. Methods: The growth-inhibiting effects of 23 flavonoids on HL-60 cells were detected by MTT assay. Three flavonoids with strong inhibitory activities and two flavonoids with weak inhibitory activities were screened and used for comparative study. Effects of these 5 flavonoids on apoptosis of HL-60 cells were detected by Annexin- V FITC/PI staining. The changes in the intracellular level of ROS were determined by flow cytometry and laser scan microscope using a ROS probe (2′, 7′ -dichlorofluorescein-diacetate, DCFH-DA), respectively. Results: Three flavonoids with potent cytotoxicities (3,6-dihydroxyflavone, luteolin, and geraldol) and 2 flavonoids with weak activities (hesperetin and naringenin) were selected from 23 flavonoids. 3,6-dihydroxyflavone, luteolin, and geraldol significantly increased the apoptotic ratio of HL-60 cells while hesperetin and naringenin had no significant effects on apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Additionally, 3,6-dihydroxyflavone, luteolin and geraldol markedly increased ROS level in a short time. The increase in ROS level induced by geraldol was significantly higher than control within 24 h. Then the ROS level in 3,6-dihydroxyflavone and luteolin-treated group gradually decreased which was significantly lower than the control. Hesperetin and naringenin had no significant effects on the ROS level in HL-60 cells. Conclusion: 3,6-dihydroxyflavone, luteolin, and geraldol significantly influenced the ROS levels in HL-60 cells, induced apoptosis and caused proliferation inhibition.

77953960882	Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase regulates ABCG1-mediated oxysterol efflux from endothelial cells and protects against hypercholesterolemia-induced endothelial dysfunction	Objective-: Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been identified as a regulator of vascular function via the preservation of endothelial cell (EC) function. In this study, we examined whether the beneficial effects of AMPK on ECs are dependent on its involvement in cholesterol efflux and its impact on hypercholesterolemia-induced endothelial dysfunction. Methods and Results-: Using human aortic ECs and bovine aortic ECs, we show that AMPK activation upregulates ATP binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) expression independently of liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) transcriptional activity but through a posttranscriptional mechanism that increases mRNA stability. Using a heterologous system and a luciferase reporter, we further identify that the 3′-untranslated region of the ABCG1 mRNA is responsible for the regulatory effects of AMPK activation. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1- β-d-riboside treatment promotes endothelial 7-ketocholesterol efflux and prevents 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC)-induced reactive oxygen species production in an ABCG1-dependent manner, thus preserving endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide bioavailability. Notably, in vivo studies using C57BL/6J mice receiving a high-cholesterol diet revealed that the infusion of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-riboside increases vascular ABCG1 expression and improves vascular reactivity. These effects are abrogated by the AMPK antagonist compound C and by the vascular gene transfer of ABCG1 small interfering RNA. Conclusion-: Our current findings uncover a novel mechanism by which AMPK protects against hypercholesterolemia-mediated endothelial dysfunction. © 2010 American Heart Association, Inc.

77955658816	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside inhibits LPS-induced expression of inflammatory mediators through decreasing IκBα phosphorylation in THP-1 cells	Objective and design: As a common phytochemical, cyanidin 3-O-β-glucoside (C3G) has a role in inhibiting inflammatory mediators; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of C3G on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNFα and IL-6 expression in the human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1, and to explore the mechanisms involved. Methods: Differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of C3G (0.005, 0.05, 0.5,10 μM) in the absence or presence of 1 ng/mL LPS. mRNA expression levels were detected by real time PCR, and secretion of TNFα and IL-6, phosphorylated IκBα, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) P65 were monitored by ELISA or Western blotting analysis. The role of an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation, BAY 11-7082, in C3G inhibition of LPS-induced cytokines expression was investigated. Results: C3G (0.05-0.5 μM) treatment significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated TNFα and IL-6 mRNA expression and secretion of these proteins by THP-1 cells. Phosphorylation of IκBα and NF-κB nuclear translocation could be blocked by 0.5 μM C3G. BAY 11-7082 treatment abolished C3G-induced reduction of TNFα and IL-6. Conclusion: Our results suggest that C3G exerts its anti-inflammatory effect through inhibiting IκBα phosphorylation, thereby suppressing NF-κB activity in THP-1 cells. © 2010 Springer Basel AG.

77955840338	Two-year effects of a school-based prevention programme on adolescent cigarette smoking in Guangzhou, China: A cluster randomized trial	Background: The prevalence of adolescent smoking has been increasing rapidly in China. Theory-based smoking prevention programmes in schools may be an effective approach in preventing smoking among Chinese adolescents. Methods: A school-level cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted among 7th and 8th grade students (N = 2343) in four junior high schools in southern China during 2004-06. The theory-based, multi-level intervention was compared with the standard health curriculum. Outcome measures comprised changes in students' smoking-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Results: The mean knowledge scores from baseline to the 1- and 2-year follow-ups increased more in the intervention group than in the control group, whereas there was little change in attitude scores. At the 1-year follow-up (the total sample), the interventions reduced the probability of baseline experimental smokers' escalating to regular smoker [7.9 vs 18.3%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.97, P = 0.043], but did not reduce the probability of baseline non-smokers' initiating smoking (7.9 vs 10.6% adjusted OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.54-1.38, P = 0.538). At the 2-year follow-up (only 7th grade students), similar proportions of baseline non-smokers initiated smoking in the intervention group and the control group (13.5 vs 13.1%), while a possibly lower proportion of baseline experimental smokers escalated to regular smoking in the intervention group than the control group (22.6 vs 40.0% adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.12-1.57, P = 0.199). Conclusions: This multi-level intervention programme had a moderate effect on inhibiting the escalation from experimental to regular smoking among Chinese adolescents, but had little effect on the initiation of smoking. The programme improved adolescents' smoking-related knowledge, but did not change their attitudes towards smoking. © The Author 2010.

77958465082	Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase induces cholesterol efflux from macrophage-derived foam cells and alleviates atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice	Increasing evidence suggests that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) exerts protective effects for cardiovascular diseases apart from the regulation of energy homeostasis. However, the role of AMPK and its underlying mechanism on macrophage foam cell formation are poorly understood. In this study, we sought to investigate the potential effects of AMPK in modulating cholesterol deposition by using murine macrophage-derived foam cells. Incubation with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) markedly attenuated the cholesterol ester accumulation in oxidized low density lipoprotein-loaded macrophages. Notably, AICAR treatment significantly increased ATP-binding cassette transporters G1 (Abcg1) mRNA and protein levels without affecting mRNA and protein expression of ABCA1, scavenger receptors, including scavenger receptor-A, CD36, and scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI), and cholesterol synthesis-related genes. The up-regulation of Abcg1 by AICAR was independent of the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor pathway but dependent on ERK activation. AICAR elevates Abcg1 expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism that stabilizes the mRNA. Using a heterologous system with luciferase as a reporter, we further identify the Abcg1 mRNA 3′-UTR responsible for the regulatory effect of AICAR. Prevention of ABCG1 expression by small interfering RNA abolished the AICAR-mediated attenuation on foam cell formation. Furthermore, increased ABCG1 expression and reduced lipid accumulation were demonstrated in AICAR-treated macrophages isolated from apolipoprotein E-deficient mice (apoE

78650338831	Protocatechuic acid, a metabolite of anthocyanins, inhibits monocyte adhesion and reduces atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice	Polyphenols, including anthocyanins, from various plant foods are effective in the prevention of atherosclerosis in animal and human studies. Protocatechuic acid (PCA), a major metabolite of anthocyanins, has been found to possess the anti-carcinogenic effect, whereas the in vivo effect of PCA as an anti-atherosclerotic agent remains unknown. We demonstrated herein that PCA inhibited monocyte adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-activated mouse aortic endothelial cells, associated with the inhibition of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression. Furthermore, PCA inhibited the nuclear content of p65, a subunit of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), along with reduced NF-κB binding activity. Finally, PCA administration in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mouse model reduced aortic VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 expression, NF-κB activity, and plasma-soluble VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 levels, with inhibiting atherosclerosis development. We suggest that PCA possesses the anti-atherogenic effect at least partially via its anti-inflammatory activity. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

Methods Sixty patients with T2DM were enroUed and divided into two groups based on C-IMT : group A ( C-IMT < 1 mm, n = 30 ) and group B ( C-IMT≥ 1 mm, n = 30). All subjects were investigated with questionnaires including 3-day food recall They all took somatometry measurement Blood and urine samples were collected in all subjects to examine the levels of high sensitive-CRP, C-peptide, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood lipid, renal function, urine microalbumin, and other indicators. Results The intakes of vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products were significantly higher in group A than in group B ( P < 0. 05 ). The intake of vitamin C in group A was significantly higher than that in group B ( P < 0. 05). The levels of CRP in group B was significant higher than that in group A (P = 0.000). Positive correlation was found between CRP level and C-IMT in T2DM patiente ( r = 0. 36, P = 0. 004 ). Furthermore, CRP was negatively correlated with the intakes of vegetables and fruits ( r = - 0. 334, P = 0. 01 ) , aquatic products ( r = 0.315, P = 0.016), and vitamin C (r= -0.2786, P=0.038), respectively. The intake of fruits was negatively correlated with C-IMT (r, = -0. 33, P = 0. 01 ). Conclusions T2DM patients without carotid atherosclerosis intake more vegetables, fruits, aquatic products and vitamin C than those with atherosclerosis. Vegetables, fruits, sea foods and vitamin C may be the protective factors against atherosclerosis in T2DM patients. CRP is associated with the development of atherosclerosis in T2DM patients.

79151482464	Prevalence and factors related to syringe sharing behaviours among female injecting drug users who are also sex workers in China	Background: Female injecting drug users who are sex workers (IDUFSWs) are at high risk of contracting HIV. They may bridge HIV transmissions from injecting drug users to clients of female sex workers. Methods: A total of 216 non-institutionalised IDUFSWs were recruited by snowball sampling methods. Anonymous face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect data. Univariate, multivariate and hierarchical logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the associations between background characteristics, cognitive variables, psychological stress and syringe sharing behaviours among IDUFSWs. Results: Respectively 33.8% and 27.8% of the respondents injected drugs with others' used syringes and gave used syringes to others for drug injection in the last month. These two syringe sharing behaviours were significantly associated with inconsistent condom use during commercial sex (OR = 5.00 and 1.92, p< 0.05). Over 90% of the respondents reported at least one type(s) of psychological distress included in this study. Adjusting for significant background variables, all variables that are related to the Theory of Planned Behaviour (attitude, norm, perceived control and behavioural intention) and psychological distress (except for depression) were significantly associated with injecting drugs with others' used syringes (adjusted OR = 2.08-6.25, p< 0.05), whilst variables related to perceived control, behavioural intention and insomnia were significantly associated with providing used syringes to others for injection (adjusted OR = 2.00-3.56, p< 0.05). In two separate summary multivariate models, variables related to the Theory of Planned Behaviours and psychological distress were independently associated with injecting drugs with others' used syringes (OR = 1.98-4.02, p< 0.05) and giving used syringes to others for injection (OR = 2.06-3.59, p< 0.05). Conclusions: Syringe sharing behaviours were prevalent among IDUFSWs and were associated with cognitive and psychological factors. Effective integrative intervention programmes targeting IDUFSWs are warranted. © 2010.

79952761064	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside improves obesity and triglyceride metabolism in KK-Ay mice by regulating lipoprotein lipase activity	BACKGROUND: Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-g)-rich foods have been reported to inhibit the onset of obesity, but whether the pure anthocyanin supplementation affects obesity remains uncertain. RESULTS: Cy-3-g supplementation significantly reduced obesity, accumulation of fat in visceral adipose and liver tissues, and plasma triglyceride levels. Furthermore, adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (pAMPK) in the skeletal muscle and visceral adipose were significantly increased by Cy-3-g consumption. This was followed by the activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in plasma and skeletal muscle but the suppression of this enzyme in visceral adipose. LPL activation in skeletal muscle cells and its suppression in adipocytes by Cy-3-g were blocked by inhibition of pAMPK. CONCLUSION: Our present data thus demonstrate that Cy-3-g improves obesity and triglyceride metabolism in KK-Ay mice. The underlying mechanism is found to be partly related to the activation of LPL in plasma and skeletal muscle, and inhibition of LPL in adipose tissue following the activation of pAMPK. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.

79954989314	Anthocyanin inhibits high glucose-induced hepatic mtGPAT1 activation and prevents fatty acid synthesis through PKC ζ	Mitochondrial acyl-CoA:glycerol-sn-3-phosphate acyltransferase 1 (mtGPAT1) controls the fi rst step of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis and is critical to the understanding of chronic metabolic disorders such as primary nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Anthocyanin, a large group of polyphenols, was negatively correlated with hepatic lipid accumulation, but its impact on mtGPAT1 activity and NAFLD has yet to be determined. Hepatoma cell lines and KKAy mice were used to investigate the impact of anthocyanin on high glucose-induced mtGPAT1 activation and hepatic steatosis. Treatment with anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-g) reduced high glucose-induced GPAT1 activity through the prevention of mtGPAT1 translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), thereby suppressing intracellular de novo lipid synthesis. Cy-3-g treatment also increased protein kinase C ζ phosphorylation and membrane translocation in order to phosphorylate the mtF0F1-ATPase β -subunit, reducing its enzymatic activity and thus inhibiting mtGPAT1 activation. In vivo studies further showed that Cy-3-g treatment signifi cantly decreases hepatic mtGPAT1 activity and its presence in OMM isolated from livers, thus ameliorating hepatic steatosis in diabetic KKAy mice. Our fi ndings reveal a novel mechanism by which anthocyanin regulates lipogenesis and thereby inhibits hepatic steatosis, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in diabetes and related steatotic liver diseases.

79953810587	Oltipraz upregulates the nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha subunit (NRF2) antioxidant system and prevents insulin resistance and obesity induced by a high-fat diet in C57BL/6J mice	Aims/hypothesis: We investigated whether oltipraz, a nuclear respiratory factor 2 alpha subunit (NRF2) activator, improves insulin sensitivity and prevents the development of obesity in mice. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were fed with a low-fat diet (10% of energy as fat), a high-fat diet (HFD) (45% of energy as fat) or a HFD with oltipraz for 28 weeks. The effects of oltipraz on body weight, fat content, glucose disposal, insulin signalling, metabolic profiles and endogenous NRF2 functional status in the three groups of mice were investigated. Results: Oltipraz prevented or significantly attenuated the effect of HFD on glucose disposal, body weight and fat gain. Impairment of protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation in this HFD-fed mouse model in response to intraperitoneal insulin injection was observed in adipose tissue, but not in the muscles, accompanied by inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase signalling and activation of p70S6 kinase, as well as reduced GLUT4 content. These defects were attenuated by oltipraz administration. Nuclear content of NRF2 in adipose tissue was reduced by HFD feeding, associated with increased Keap1 mRNA expression and reduced production of haem oxygenase-1 and superoxide dismutase, increased protein oxidation, decreased plasma reduced:oxidised glutathione ratio and the appearance of macrophage marker F4/80. These defects were also restored by oltipraz. Finally, oltipraz attenuated HFD-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase overproduction. Conclusions/interpretation: Impairment of the endogenous redox system is important in the development of obesity and insulin resistance in chronic HFD feeding. NRF2 activation represents a potential novel approach in the treatment and prevention of obesity and diabetes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

79955911056	Cancer mortality in a Chinese population surrounding a multi-metal sulphide mine in Guangdong province: An ecologic study	Background: The Dabaoshan mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province, China, is at high risk of multi-metal pollutant discharge into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. Following approximately 30 years of exposure to these metals, little is known regarding the subsequent health effects and risks for the local residents. In our present study, we have estimated the relationships between long-term environmental exposure to multiple heavy metals and the risk of cancer mortality in a Chinese population in the vicinity of Dabaoshan. Methods. An ecologic study was performed. Between 2000-2007, a total population of 194,131 lived in the nine agricultural villages that surround the Hengshihe area. Heavy metals concentrations were determined in local environmental samples (water and crops) and whole blood taken from 1152 local residents of both a high-exposure area (HEA) and a low-exposure area (LEA). We calculated the rate ratio and standardized mortality ratios based on age- and gender-specific cancer mortality rates for the different reference populations (based on district, county and province). Simple, multiple linear and ridge regression models were used to evaluate the associations between exposure to multiple heavy metals and cancer mortality in the nine villages, after adjustment for age and sex. Results: The geometric mean blood levels of cadmium and lead were measured at 24.10 g/L and 38.91 g/dL for subjects (n = 563) in the HEA and 1.87 g/L and 4.46 g/dL for subjects (n = 589) from the LEA, respectively (P < 0.001). The rate of mortality from all cancers in the HEA was substantially elevated in comparison with the corresponding mortality rate in the LEA for men (rate ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence intervals = 1.63 - 2.77) and women (2.83; 1.91 - 4.19); rates were also significantly elevated compared with the rate when compared to the entire Wengyuan County area, or the provincial reference population. In addition, mortality rates were significantly increased for stomach, lung and esophageal cancer in the HEA in comparison with the corresponding rates in the LEA, in Wengyuan County and the provincial reference population for men, women and both combined. Further analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between exposure to cadmium and lead and the risk of all-cancers and stomach cancer mortality among women and both sexes, whilst zinc exposure showed no association with the risk of site-specific cancer mortality in the nine villages evaluated. Conclusions: The findings of this study reveal probable associations between long-term environmental exposure to both cadmium and lead and an increased risk of mortality from all cancer, as well as from stomach, esophageal and lung-cancers. © 2011 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

79957871438	Optimization of ultrasound-assisted extraction of anthocyanins from mulberry, using response surface methodology	Mulberry is one of the most widely used traditional Chinese medicines. Anthocyanins are the main bioactive components of mulberry, and possess important biological activities, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This study investigated the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of anthocyanins from mulberry by using response surface methodology (RSM). The extraction conditions associated with anthocyanin yield, including extraction solvent, liquid-to-solid rate, temperature and extraction time, are discussed. The optimal conditions obtained by RSM for UAE from mulberry include 63.8% methanol contains 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 43.2 °C temperature, 23.8 (v/w) liquid-to-solid ratio, and 40 min time for the maximum yield (64.70 ± 0.45 mg/g). The results indicated that the UAE can be an effective method for the extraction of some active components from plant materials. © 2011 by the authors.

Homocysteine influences the liver expression of ApoA-I and decreases its blood level and HDL in genetic mice model. We aimed therefore to evaluate whether homocysteine and cysteine are associated with lipid parameters, and the joint effects of them on the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), cysteine (tCys) and lipid markers were measured in 2058 consecutive coronary artery angiographic patients. Results: Plasma tHcy but not tCys correlated negatively with ApoA-I (r = -0.153, P < 0.001) and with HDL cholesterol (r = -0.148, P < 0.001), and correlated positively with the risk of CAD (OR: 1.61; 95% confidence interval; 1.26 to 2.05). Combination of high tHcy and high tCys levels was associated with decreased ApoA-I and HDL cholesterol levels, and with increased risk of CAD (OR: 1.696, 95% CI (1.301-2.211)). Furthermore, low HDL cholesterol combined with low tHcy or high tHcy all had increased risk for CAD (OR: 1.254, 95% CI (1.114-1.565); OR: 1.332, 95% CI (1.093-1.624); respectively) whereas high HDL cholesterol counteracted the harmful effect of high tHcy on the risk of CAD. However, only the combination of high tHcy and high ApoA-I had an increased risk for CAD (OR: 1.438, 95% CI (1.170-1.768)). Conclusions: The association of homocysteine and cysteine, ApoA-I or HDL cholesterol and their joint effects provide new insights on its role on CAD. © 2011 Xiao et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

80051791999	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside with the aid of its metabolite protocatechuic acid, reduces monocyte infiltration in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice	Polyphenols, including anthocyanins, from various plant foods are effective in reducing the severity of atherosclerosis in animal and human studies. Due to the poor understanding of the bioavailability of anthocyanins, the potential antiatherogenic mechanisms underlying the action remain largely unknown. Herein, we found that oral gavage of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (Cy-3-G) could be transformed into protocatechuic acid (PCA), and the plasma maximal levels of Cy-3-G were 3.7-fold lower than that of PCA in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice. Subsequently, we observed that PCA treatment has a higher capacity than Cy-3-G treatment in decreasing CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) expression in the mouse peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs), along with reducing the mouse PBMs chemokine toward CC ligand-2 (CCL2) in a Boyden chamber. Interesting, in the ApoE-deficient mouse model, orally gavaged with Cy-3-G has a higher ability than gavaged with PCA to reduce CCR2 expression in PBMs. PBMs deprived from the Cy-3-G-treated ApoE-deficient mice have a lower ability than those from PCA-treated animals to migrate toward CCL2. Furthermore, as compared with the PCA group, Cy-3-G treatment more efficiently reduced thioglycollate-induced macrophage infiltration into the abdominal cavity. Thus, we suggest that Cy-3-G may reduce the monocyte infiltration in mice via down-regulation of CCR2 expression in monocytes, at least in part, with the aid of its metabolite PCA. These above data imply that the anti-monocyte/macrophage infiltration property of Cy-3-G and its metabolite PCA may be an important antiatherogenic mechanism for anthocyanins. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.

80051792291	Long-term heavy metal pollution and mortality in a Chinese population: An ecologic study	The concentrations of heavy metals in both local environmental samples (water and crops) and in the whole blood of 1,152 local residents were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. We calculated rate ratios and standardized mortality ratios based on age-, gender-, and cause-specific mortality for both the district and province. Multiregression models were then used to evaluate the associations between the exposure to multiple heavy metals and cause-specific mortality in the studied population. Significant increases in the mean concentrations of cadmium, lead, and zinc in the blood samples were found to be associated with a substantially elevated all-cancer mortality rate in this highexposure area (HEA). There were also significantly elevated mortality rates in the HEA for both sexes from a wide range of causes (all-cause), including cardiovascular disease (CVD), when compared with a low-exposure area (LEA). Further analysis showed positive correlations between exposure to both cadmium and lead and a higher risk of all-cancer mortality among women and for both sexes combined. In contrast, zinc exposure negatively correlated with the risk of cause-specific mortality, but this was not significant. These results of our current study thus reveal that long-term environmental exposure to both cadmium and lead is associated with an increased risk of all-cause, CVD, and all-cancer mortality, whereas zinc exposure showed a possible weak protection against death from CVD. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

80053423939	Fruit Consumption Is Associated with Lower Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and C-Reactive Protein Levels in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Preliminary evidence in support of fruit intake for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between fruit consumption and cardiovascular risk factors such as carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in patients with T2DM. In this cross-sectional study, 407 patients with T2DM were recruited from August 2007 to December 2009. Dietary assessment based on 3-day 24-hour recall interviews, hsCRP levels, and CIMT were examined. Participants were categorized into three tertiles based on fruit intake. Comparisons of the participants' clinical characteristics among the three categories were performed using either one-way analysis of variance or analysis of covariance. In patients with type 2 diabetes with CIMT ≥1 mm, the intake of fruit was lower (P=0.001), whereas the serum hsCRP level was higher (P<0.001) compared with patients showing CIMT <1 mm. Results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the odds ratios of CIMT and hsCRP were 8% and 31% lower, respectively, in participants in the top tertile compared with those in the lowest tertile (P=0.018 and P<0.001, respectively) after adjustment for potential confounders. Hence, a reduction in hsCRP concentration and CIMT were found to be associated with an increase in fruit intake. Sufficient daily intake of fruits should, therefore, be considered as an important component of a medical nutritional therapy strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in patients with T2DM. © 2011 American Dietetic Association.

80055085513	Purified anthocyanin supplementation improves endothelial function via NO-cGMP activation in hypercholesterolemic individuals	BACKGROUND: Anthocyanins have been shown to improve endothelial function in animal models. However, whether these compounds have similar beneficial effects in humans is largely unknown. METHODS: In a short-term crossover study, 12 hypercholesterolemic individuals were given oral anthocyanins (320 mg) isolated from berries or placebo. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed before and after the intervention. In a long-term intervention trial (12 weeks), 150 hypercholesterolemic individuals were given anthocyanins (320 mg/ day, n = 75) or placebo (n = 75), after which we measured FMD, plasma cGMP, and other serum biomarkers. Another short-term intervention was conducted in the presence of NO-cGMP inhibitors in 6 people and in a rat aortic ring model (n = 8). RESULTS: Significant increases of FMD from 8.3% (0.6%) at baseline to 11.0% (0.8%) at 1 h and 10.1% (0.9%) at 2 h were observed after short-term anthocyanin consumption, concomitantly with increases of plasma anthocyanin concentrations (P < 0.05). In the study participants who received long-term anthocyanin intervention, compared with the control group, we observed significant increases in the FMD (28.4% vs 2.2%),cGMP(12.6% vs-1.2%), and HDL-cholesterol concentrations, but decreases in the serum soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 and LDL cholesterol concentrations (P < 0.05). The changes in the cGMP and HDL cholesterol concentrations positively correlated with FMD in the anthocyanin group (P<0.05). In the presence of NO-cGMP inhibitors, the effects of anthocyanin on endothelial function were abolished in human participants and in a rat aortic ring model. CONCLUSIONS: Anthocyanin supplementation improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation in hypercholesterolemic individuals. This effect involves activation of the NO-cGMP signaling pathway, improvements in the serum lipid profile, and decreased inflammation. © 2011 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.

80955165955	Inhibitory Effect of Delphinidin on Monocyte-Endothelial Cell Adhesion Induced by Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein via ROS/p38MAPK/NF-κB Pathway	Monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium and their subsequent trans-endothelial migration are pivotal early events in atherogenesis. In this study, the effect of delphinidin, belonging to the group of anthocyanin, on adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells induced by ox-LDL was investigated. The results showed that the pre-treatment with delphinidin (50, 100, or 200 μM) dose-dependently decreased the ox-LDL-induced up-regulation of the expression of ICAM-1 and P-selectin, and the enhanced adhesion and transmigration of monocytes. To determine the role of ROS/p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway, intracellular ROS level, p38MAPK protein expression, NF-κB transcription activity and protein expression, IκB-α degradation, NADPH oxidase subunit (Nox2 and p22phox) protein, and mRNA expression were measured. The results showed that delphinidin attenuated ox-LDL-induced generation of ROS, p38MAPK protein expression, NF-κB transcription activity and protein expression, IκB-α degradation, NADPH oxidase subunit (Nox2 and p22phox) protein and mRNA expression in endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that delphinidin attenuates ox-LDL induced expression of adhesion molecules (P-selectin and ICAM-1) and the adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells by inhibiting ROS/p38MAPK/NF-κB pathway. These findings provide a basis for the design of potent antiatherosclerotic agents that will have therapeutic potential in the prevention of AS. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

81555203009	Interaction between heavy smoking and CYP2A6 genotypes on type 2 diabetes and its possible pathways	Objective: To explore the interactions between smoking and CYP2A6 genotypes on type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as well as potential pathways for smoking in causing T2DM. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 1344 smokers with complete data from a community-based T2DM survey in Guangzhou and Zhuhai of China from July 2006 to June 2007 were interviewed with a structured questionnaire about socio-demographic status and daily cigarette consumption. Serum glucose, insulin, and cotinine were measured after an overnight fast. Subjects were genotyped for CYP2A6 and classified, according to genotype, into normal, intermediate, slow, or poor nicotine metabolizers based on prior knowledge of CYP2A6 allele associations with nicotine C-oxidation rate. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist-to-hip ratio ≥0.90 for males or ≥0.85 for females. Type 2 diabetic patients (n=154) were diagnosed according to WHO 1999 criteria. Chi-square tests, multivariate logistic regression models, and a structural equation model were used in this study. Results: Multivariate analysis indicated that, compared with light smoking, heavy smoking significantly increased the risk of T2DM (odds ratio (OR)=1.75, 95% CI=1.01-3.05). There were significant interactions between heavy smoking and slow CYP2A6 (OR=5.12, 95% CI=1.08-24.23) and poor CYP2A6 metabolizer genotypes (OR=8.54, 95% CI=1.28-57.02) on T2DM. Structural equation modeling indicated that CYP2A6 moderation of smoking quantity risk on T2DM was mediated by the effects on serum cotinine, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. Conclusions: Heavy smoking was significantly associated with T2DM, and this association was moderated by CYP2A6 genotype and mediated by serum cotinine, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion. © 2011 European Society of Endocrinology.

84858290692	Cyanidin 3-glucoside attenuates obesity-associated insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-fed and db/db mice via the transcription factor FoxO1	Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes, and both conditions are now recognized to possess significant inflammatory components underlying their pathophysiologies. Here, we hypothesized that cyanidin 3-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin reported to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties, would ameliorate obesity-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in mouse models of diabesity. Male C57BL/6J obese mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and genetically diabetic db/db mice at an age of 6 weeks received dietary C3G supplementation (0.2%) for 5 weeks. We found that dietary C3G lowered fasting glucose levels and markedly improved the insulin sensitivity in both high-fat diet fed and db/db mice as compared with unsupplemented controls. White adipose tissue messenger RNA levels and serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) were reduced by C3G, as did macrophage infiltration in adipose tissue. Concomitantly, hepatic triglyceride content and steatosis were alleviated by C3G. Moreover, C3G treatment decreased c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation and promoted phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of forkhead box O1 after refeeding. These findings clearly indicate that C3G has significant potency in antidiabetic effects by modulating the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/forkhead box O1 signaling pathway and the related inflammatory adipocytokines. © 2012.

84857055695	Cyanidin-3-glucoside suppresses TNF-α-induced cell proliferation through the repression of Nox activator 1 in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells: Involvement of the STAT3 signaling	Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a member of the anthocyanin family which belongs to the flavonoid class and possesses antiatherogenic properties. Many studies have demonstrated the protective effects of C3G on vascular endothelial cells and monocytes, however, the precise effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been less thoroughly studied. Hence, we investigated the role of C3G in TNF-α-induced VSMCs proliferation and explored the possible mechanisms. TNF-α stimulated VSMCs proliferation, and pretreatment with C3G inhibited the proliferation in dose- and time-dependent manners. Then, we found that C3G attenuated TNF-α-induced ROS over generation by Dihydroethidium staining. The combination of 50 μM C3G and 100 μM apocynin significantly reduced ROS generation. Moreover, C3G pretreatment significantly suppressed the expression of Nox activator 1, a subunit of NADPH oxidase in mouse VSMCs. C3G also inhibited TNF-α-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) phosphorylation, and the inhibitory effect was more prominent in C3G and apocynin co-pretreated cells than that pretreated with C3G or apocynin alone. Administration of the ROS scavenger catalase (2,000 U/ml) remarkably inhibited TNF-α-induced cell proliferation and STAT3 activation. These data suggest that C3G exerts its antiproliferative effect on TNF-α-induced VSMCs proliferation through inhibiting STAT3 activation by attenuating NoxA1-derived ROS over production. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84856037306	Optimization of microwave-assisted extraction of anthocyanins from mulberry and identification of anthocyanins in extract using HPLC-ESI-MS	Anthocyanins are naturally occurring compounds that impart color to fruits, vegetables, and plants. This study aims to optimize the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) conditions of anthocyanins from mulberry (M. atropurpureaRoxb.) using response surface methodology (RSM). A Box-Behnken experiment was employed in this regard. Methanol concentration, microwave power, and extraction time were chosen as independent variables. The optimized conditions of MAE were as follows: 59.6% acidified methanol, 425 W power, 25 (v/w) liquid-to-solid ratio, and 132 s time. Under these conditions, 54.72 mg anthocyanins were obtained from 1.0 g mulberry powder. Furthermore, 8 anthocyanins were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) in mulberry extract. The results showed that cyanidin-3-glucoside and cyanidin-3-rutinoside are the major anthocyanins in mulberry. In addition, in comparison with conventional extraction, MAE is more rapid and efficient for extracting anthocyanins from mulberry. © 2011 Institute of Food Technologists

84859745305	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside upregulates hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase expression and reduces hypercholesterolemia in mice	Scope: Although previous studies have shown that consumption of anthocyanin extract from plant foods reduces hypercholesterolemia and the severity of atherosclerosis in different animal models, the mechanisms of these actions remained unclear. This study investigated whether pure anthocyanin inhibit atherosclerosis development and reduce hypercholesterolemia in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice through enhancement of fecal bile acid excretion, a critical pathway for eliminating circulation cholesterol from the body. Methods and results: Five-week-old male ApoE-deficient mice were fed the AIN-93G diet supplemented with or without cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside (0.06% w/w) for 12 weeks. Results showed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside consumption inhibited the formation of aortic sinus plaque and reduced hypercholesterolemia, along with promoted fecal bile acid excretion and upregulated hepatic cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase expression (CYP7A1). In mouse primary hepatocytes, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside treatment increased bile acid synthesis and CYP7A1 expression in a liver X receptor alpha (LXRα)-)-dependent manner. Scintillation proximity and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays revealed that cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside functions as an agonist of LXRα. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the hypocholesterolemic activity of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside was, at least in part, mediated by activating the potential LXRα-CYP7A1-bile acid excretion pathway, thus contributing to the antiatherogenic effect of cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside. Importantly, cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside could activate LXRα in an agonist-dependent manner. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84862062712	Plant food delphinidin-3-glucoside significantly inhibits platelet activation and thrombosis: Novel protective roles against cardiovascular diseases	Delphinidin-3-glucoside (Dp-3-g) is one of the predominant bioactive compounds of anthocyanins in many plant foods. Although several anthocyanin compounds have been reported to be protective against cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), the direct effect of anthocyanins on platelets, the key players in atherothrombosis, has not been studied. The roles of Dp-3-g in platelet function are completely unknown. The present study investigated the effects of Dp-3-g on platelet activation and several thrombosis models in vitro and in vivo. We found that Dp-3-g significantly inhibited human and murine platelet aggregation in both platelet-rich plasma and purified platelets. It also markedly reduced thrombus growth in human and murine blood in perfusion chambers at both low and high shear rates. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that Dp-3-g decreased platelet deposition, destabilized thrombi, and prolonged the time required for vessel occlusion. Dp-3-g also significantly inhibited thrombus growth in a carotid artery thrombosis model. To elucidate the mechanisms, we examined platelet activation markers via flow cytometry and found that Dp-3-g significantly inhibited the expression of P-selectin, CD63, CD40L, which reflect platelet α- and δ-granule release, and cytosol protein secretion, respectively. We further demonstrated that Dp-3-g downregulated the expression of active integrin αIIbβ3 on platelets, and attenuated fibrinogen binding to platelets following agonist treatment, without interfering with the direct interaction between fibrinogen and integrin αIIbβ3. We found that Dp-3-g reduced phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, which may contribute to the observed inhibitory effects on platelet activation. Thus, Dp-3-g significantly inhibits platelet activation and attenuates thrombus growth at both arterial and venous shear stresses, which likely contributes to its protective roles against thrombosis and CVDs. © 2012 Yang et al.

84862235241	Docosahexaenoic acid ameliorates palmitate-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation through repressing NLRC4 inflammasome activation in HepG2 cells	Background: N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), has clinical significance in the prevention and reversal of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, the precious mechanism underlying remains unclear. The inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by NOD-like receptor (NLR) family members, has been recently shown to be activated in NASH and promote the cleavage of the pro-inflammatory cytokines to their maturation forms. Methods: HepG2 cells were exposed to different dose of PA for 24 h with or without the preincubation of 50 μM DHA for another 24 h and then lipid deposition was assessed with Oil red O staining and intracellular triglyceride (TG) determination. Secretory levels of inflammatory cytokines and Caspase-1 activity were determined by ELISA assays. Gene expression and protein levels were determined by quantitative RCR and western blotting, respectively. Results: Palmitate (PA) dose-dependently increased lipid accumulation, TG content and induced the secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18, TNF-α and MCP-1 from HepG2 cells. Preincubation with DHA significantly alleviated PA-induced lipid accumulation and inflammatory agents. DHA was also found to attenuate PA-induced NOD-like receptor protein 4 (NLRC4) mRNA expression. Furthermore, PA induced caspase-1 activation in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in exacerbating of procaspase-1 and pro-IL-1β processing. Knockdown of NLRC4 partially abrogated PA-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation and completely abolished these events in the presence of DHA. Conclusions: Our findings indicate DHA attenuates PA-induced lipid accumulation and inflammation through suppressing NLRC4 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β cleavage. © 2012 Bag et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862784186	Misconceptions toward methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and associated factors among new MMT users in Guangzhou, China	The methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) program is scaling up in China, but little is known about drug users' cognitions of MMT. To investigate the prevalence and associated factors of MMT-related misconceptions, a totally of 300 newly admitted MMT users were interviewed in three MMT clinics in Guangzhou. Four statements were used to assess MMT-related misconceptions. The results showed that the majority of participants misconceived that MMT is intended primarily for detoxification (92.3%), that one could be completely detoxified and quit using methadone after using it for 2-3. months (64.2%), that MMT is not a long-term or even lifetime treatment (77.9%); and that one should attempt to reduce its treatment dosage as methadone is harmful to one's health (84.3%); 48.5% of the respondents possessed all four types of misconceptions. Prior experience of methadone use in voluntary drug detoxification centers (OR. =. 1.82 to 2.55, . p<. 0.05) was associated with some misconception items, whilst being introduced by some peer drug users or community members to use MMT (versus not being introduced by anyone; OR. =. 0.38 to 0.50, . p<. 0.05), having taken up HIV voluntary counseling and testing prior to admission (OR. =. 0.52, . p<. 0.05), and a higher HIV-related knowledge level (OR. =. 0.38, . p<. 0.05) were associated with lower likelihoods for possessing some of the misconceptions. The findings suggested that MMT-related misconceptions were very prevalent among newly recruited MMT users in China. Misconceptions are potential factors causing drop-outs. Interventions targeting such misconceptions are greatly warranted. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863390903	Comparison of dietary habits between migrant and local adolescents in Shenzhen, China	Background: It is estimated that the number of migrant adolescents in Chinese cities may have reached 25 million. However, little research has been conducted on their dietary habits. The objective of this study was to compare dietary habits between migrant and local adolescents in Shenzhen, China. Methods: A school based crosssectional study was conducted in 3368 adolescents (aged 11-18 years; 52.5% boys). A self-administered questionnaire completed by adolescents was designed to gather information on socio-demographic characteristics, meal location, food pattern and intake. Results: Of the 3368 adolescents, 58.2% were migrants. Compared with locals, migrant adolescents showed significantly higher percentage of having three meals away-from home. Nearly half of the subjects (45.6 %) skipped breakfast, with a higher proportion among migrant students (48.5 vs 41.5%). Migrant students consumed street food more frequently (12.2 vs 8.5%), while the difference was opposite in Western fast food intake (27.3 vs 32.5%). No significant difference was found in snacks intake between these two groups. Migrant students exhibited lower percentage of vegetables (57.3 vs 63.7%), fruits (27.7 vs 38.3%), meats (37.0 vs 44.3%), soybean (11.6 vs 17.5%) and dairy products (28.4 vs 42.5%) intake daily. After adjusted for socio-demographic confounders, the difference mentioned above still remained except Western fast food. Conclusion: Dietary habits among adolescents showed pronounced household variation. Migrant adolescents are more likely to exhibit unhealthy dietary behavior. Schools and families should collaborate to improve the dietary environment for adolescents, especially those from migrant families.

84863784915	Differences of smoking knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors between medical and non-medical students	Background Previous studies in the world reported inconsistent results about the relationship of medical professional education with medical students' smoking behaviors, and no similar research had been published in China. Purpose This paper aims to explore whether the differences of smoking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors existed between medical and non-medical undergraduate students. Methods Eight thousand one hundred thirty-eight undergraduate students sampled from a university in Guangzhou were investigated with a self-administered structured questionnaire about their smoking-related knowledge, attitude and behaviors, and other relevant factors. General linear model and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to test the differences in smoking-related knowledge, attitude, and behaviors between medical and non-medical students while controlling for potential confounding variables. Results There was no difference in smoking-related knowledge scores between medical and non-medical freshmen, but medical sophomores and juniors had higher scores of smoking-related knowledge than their non-medical counterparts. The medical sophomores had higher mean score of attitudes towards smoking than non-medical ones. Before entering university, the difference in the prevalence of experimental and regular smoking between medical and non-medical college students was not significant. After entering university, in contrast, the overall prevalence of regular smoking was significantly higher among male nonmedical college students than among male medical students. Stratified by current academic year, this difference was significant only among male sophomores. Conclusions Medical students have higher smoking-related knowledge, stronger anti-smoking attitude, and lower prevalence of regular smoking than non-medical college students of similar age, which may be associated with medical professional education. © International Society of Behavioral Medicine 2010.

84864134648	Cyanidin-3-O-β-glucoside, a typical anthocyanin, exhibits antilipolytic effects in 3T3-L1 adipocytes during hyperglycemia: Involvement of FoxO1-mediated transcription of adipose triglyceride lipase	Elevated concentrations of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) have been demonstrated to potentially link obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of lipolysis reduces FFAs availability and improves insulin sensitivity. Anthocyanins from different plant foods were shown to improve hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance in vivo. In this study, cyanidin-3- O-β-glucoside (C3G), a typical anthocyanin was selected to examine its in vitro effects on high-glucose-induced lipolysis in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Incubation with C3G efficiently inhibited FFAs and glycerol release from the adipocytes during hyperglycemia in a dose- and time-dependent manner. C3G treatment also increased the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase, decreased the activity of glutamine:fructose 6-phosphate aminotransferase, reduced cellular UDP- N-acetylglucosamine production, thereby suppressing the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. In addition, C3G attenuated high-glucose-promoted O-glycosylation of transcription factor FoxO1, resulting in decreased expression of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which anthocyanin regulates FoxO1-mediated transcription of ATGL and thus inhibits adipocyte lipolysis, suggesting its potential therapeutic application in diabetes-associated hyperlipidemia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84864332701	Potential of fruit wastes as natural resources of bioactive compounds	Fruit wastes are one of the main sources of municipal waste. In order to explore the potential of fruit wastes as natural resources of bioactive compounds, the antioxidant potency and total phenolic contents (TPC) of lipophilic and hydrophilic components in wastes (peel and seed) of 50 fruits were systematically evaluated. The results showed that different fruit residues had diverse antioxidant potency and the variation was very large. Furthermore, the main bioactive compounds were identified and quantified, and catechin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, epicatechin, galangin, gallic acid, homogentisic acid, kaempferol, and chlorogenic acid were widely found in these residues. Especially, the values of ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and TPC in the residues were higher than in pulps. The results showed that fruit residues could be inexpensive and readily available resources of bioactive compounds for use in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Design A cohort study (maximum follow-up period=17.6 months) was conducted. Setting Three of the nine MMT clinics in Guangzhou, China participated in the study. Participants The sample included 158 newly admitted first-time MMT clients. Measurements Information collected included background characteristics, history of drug use, MMT-related misconceptions, dropout during the entire study period and poor adherence within the first 6 months since admission to MMT. Findings Of all newly admitted MMT clients, 98.2% possessed at least one and 50.6% possessed all four types of MMT-related misconception; 51.3% had dropped out before the completion of the study [95% confidence interval (CI): 43.5-59.1%] and 62% exhibited poor adherence within the first 6 months since admission (95% CI: 54.2-69.6%). Adjusting for significant background variables, the number of misconceived responses predicted significantly both dropout [hazard ratio (HR)=3.80 for two to three misconceived items, HR=7.13 for four misconceived items, with zero to one misconceived item being the reference] and poor adherence within the first 6 months [relative risk (RR)=4.13 for two to three misconceived items; RR=4.40 for four misconceived items, with zero to one misconceived item being the reference. Conclusions Among opiate addicts in China prescribed methadone maintenance therapy for the first time, misconceptions about this medication are prevalent and are associated with poor adherence to the medication regimen and a high a rate of dropout from the treatment programme. © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.

Methods and Results: An association analysis of 91 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with CAD risk was undertaken in 1,007 CAD patients and 889 healthy controls. Two GRSs, counted GRS (cGRS) and weighted GRS (wGRS), were calculated using the significant SNPs, and their discriminant power for CAD was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Eight SNPs (rs11206510, rs10118757, rs2383206, rs501120, rs2075292, rs174547, rs173539, and rs255052) were nominally significantly associated with CAD (P<0.05), and 5 of them were newly reported. The GRSs derived from the 8 SNPs improved the discrimination of CAD compared to that using 4 conventional risk factors (P=0.002 for cGRS and P=0.009 for wGRS). After 10-fold cross-validation 100 times, the average areas under the curve were 0.668 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.667-0.669), 0.686 (95% CI: 0.685-0.687) and 0.690 (95% CI: 0.689-0.691) for models with conventional risk factors only, conventional risk factors plus cGRS, and conventional risk factors plus wGRS, respectively. Conclusions: A multigenic GRS, generated by combining multiple gene variants, can improve discrimination of CAD, thereby confirming the joint effects of these gene variants on CAD in this Chinese Han population.

84866179634	Determination of antioxidant property and their lipophilic and hydrophilic phenolic contents in cereal grains	In order to supply new information on the antioxidant function of cereal foods, the antioxidant activity and total phenolic contents of both lipophilic and hydrophilic components of 24 cereal grains from China were systematically evaluated using spectrophotometric methods. The lipophilic components of cereals were extracted with tetrahydrofuran, and the hydrophilic ones were extracted with a methanol-acetic acid-water (50:3.7:46.3, v/v/v) mixture. Main phenolic compounds and their contents were also quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a photodiode array detector. The results showed that different cereals had diverse antioxidant capacities and the variation was very large. Phenolic compounds gallic acid, kaempferol, quercetin, galangin and cyanidin 3-glucoside were widely found in those cereals. The pigmented cereals, such as black rice, red rice and purple rice, possessed the highest antioxidant capacities and total phenolic contents among tested cereals, and could be important sources of natural antioxidants for health promotion and disease risk reduction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0037371646	Supplementation of diets with the black rice pigment fraction attenuates atherosclerotic plaque formation in apolipoprotein E deficient mice	Apolipoprotein (apo)E-deficient mice were used to study the antiatherogenic effect of black rice pigment fraction (BRF) and the possible mechanisms by which it inhibits atherogenesis. The apoE-deficient mice (n = 45) were randomly divided into three groups and received AIN-93G diet (positive group), AIN-93G with 5 g of black rice pigment fraction/100 g (BRF group) and AIN-93G with 5 g of white rice outer layer fraction/100 g (WRF group) for 16 wk. C57BL/6J mice (n = 15) received AIN-93G and were used as a control group. Blood samples were collected for measurement of lipid concentration, antioxidized LDL antibody and nitric oxide concentration. Livers were extracted for determination of cholesterol concentrations, and aortas were used to determine cholesterol concentrations and inducible nitric oxide synthase protein and mRNA expression. Hearts were used to assess atherosclerotic plaque formation. The apoE-deficient mice fed the black rice pigment fraction diet had 48% (P < 0.01) less atherosclerotic lesion area compared with apoE-deficient mice fed only the AIN-93G diet and 46% (P < 0.01) less lesion area compared with mice fed the white rice outer layer fraction diet. This observation corresponded with significantly (P < 0.05) lower total serum cholesterol, lower liver and aorta cholesterol (P < 0.01) and higher HDL cholesterol (P < 0.05) concentrations and lower (P < 0.05) antioxidized LDL antibody titer in apoE-deficient mice fed the black rice pigment fraction diet compared with positive and WRF groups. Notwithstanding this, mice fed the black rice pigment fraction diet also had lower CD4

0038709495	Physical activity, diet and cardiovascular disease risks in Chinese women	Objective: To investigate the relationship between different types and levels of physical activity and cardiovascular disease risk factors, including oxidative stress, blood lipids and insulin resistance, in a healthy female population in China. Method: Healthy women (n = 761) aged 35 to 65 years participated in this study. The habitual physical activity was evaluated by self-administered questionnaire (MOSPA). The dietary intakes of nutrients were calculated from 3-day recall records. Anthropometric data of each subject were measured, fasting blood samples were taken, and erythrocytes and serum were prepared for the measurement of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity, serum malondialdehyde, total antioxidant capacity, insulin, glucose and lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein AI (apo A) and apolipoprotein B (apo B)) concentrations. Results: Low level of physical activity was related to a lower concentration of serum apo B, and higher energy expenditure from household physical activity had a reverse relationship with serum apo B and triglyceride levels. In the group with moderate occupational energy expenditure, the concentration of serum triglycerides was lower, but that of high-density lipoprotein was higher. Moderate energy expenditure (less than 1700 kcal day

84866912278	Lack of association between four SNPs in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population: A case control study	Background: Lipoprotein (a) (Lp [a]) is known being correlated with coronary artery disease (CAD). The SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster, relating with modulating the level of plasma Lp (a), has recently been reported to be associated with CAD in Caucasians. The purpose of this study was to verify whether this finding can be expanded to the Chinese Han population. Methods and Results. Using a Chinese Han sample, which consisted of 1012 well-characterized CAD patients and 889 healthy controls, we tested the associations of four SNPs (rs2048327, rs3127599, rs7767084 and rs10755578) in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster, and their inferred haplotypes with the risk of CAD. Allelic, genotypic and haplotype association analyses all showed that the gene cluster was not associated with CAD in this Chinese Han sample. Conclusions: We for the first time explored the association of the four SNPs in the SLC22A3-LPAL2-LPA gene cluster with CAD in a large Chinese Han sample. Nevertheless, this study did not reveal any significant evidence of this gene cluster to increase the risk of CAD in this population. © 2012 Lv et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84866973849	Gut microbiota metabolism of anthocyanin promotes reverse cholesterol transport in mice via repressing miRNA-10b	Rationale: We and others have demonstrated that anthocyanins have antiatherogenic capability. Because intact anthocyanins are absorbed very poorly, the low level of circulating parent anthocyanins may not fully account for their beneficial effect. We found recently that protocatechuic acid (PCA), a metabolite of cyanidin-3 to 0-β-glucoside (Cy-3-G), has a remarkable antiatherogenic effect. Objective:: To investigate whether mouse gut microbiota metabolizes Cy-3-G into PCA and to determine whether and how PCA contributes to the antiatherogenic potency of its precursor, Cy-3-G. Methods and Results: PCA was determined as a gut microbiota metabolite of Cy-3-G in ApoE mice, verified by the utilization of antibiotics to eliminate gut microbiota and further microbiota acquisition. PCA but not Cy-3-G at physiologically reachable concentrations promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages and macrophage ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. By conducting a miRNA microarray screening, we revealed that expression of miRNA-10b in macrophages can be reduced by PCA. Functional analyses demonstrated that miRNA-10b directly represses ABCA1 and ABCG1 and negatively regulates cholesterol efflux from murine-and human-derived macrophages. Further in vitro and ex vivo analyses verified that PCA accelerates macrophage cholesterol efflux, correlating with the regulation of miRNA-10b-ABCA1/ABCG1 cascade, whereas Cy-3-G consumption promoted macrophage RCT and regressed atherosclerotic lesion in a gut microbiotaendependent manner. Conclusions:: PCA, as the gut microbiota metabolite of Cy-3-G, exerts the antiatherogenic effect partially through this newly defined miRNA-10b-ABCA1/ ABCG1-cholesterol efflux signaling cascade. Thus, gut microbiota is a potential novel target for atherosclerosis prevention and treatment. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84870836788	Evaluation of Acrylamide in Food from China by a LC/MS/MS Method	Acrylamide is potential carcinogenic compound that possesses neurotoxicity activity. In this study, the levels of acrylamide in 123 selected food samples from China was evaluated using a LC/MS/MS method. One hundred and fifteen (115) out of 123 samples showed positive levels of acrylamide in the range of 0.41 to 4,126.26 μg/kg. Generally, the highest acrylamide levels were found in fried products, such as potato, prawn strips and rice crust, with average values of 604.27, 341.40, and 201.51 μg/kg, respectively. Heated protein-rich food also showed some acrylamide content (ranging from 2.31 to 78.57 μg/kg). The results revealed that a potential acrylamide public health risk occurred in processed snacks, as well as the food consumed daily. This study supplied new information on acrylamide content of a variety of heat-treated foods from China. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84870855418	Evaluation of benzo[a]pyrene in food from China by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection	The occurrence and levels of benzo[a]pyrene in various heat-treated foods from China were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. In a total of 119 samples, 105 were found to contain benzo[a]pyrene at levels of 0.03 to 19.75 μg/kg. The benzo[a]pyrene contents in 12 animal source foods were higher than the Chinese maximum permissible level in food (5 μg/kg) and the highest level was 19.75 μg/kg, nearly four times the maximum permissible level. The results revealed a widespread carinogenic public health risk from benzo[a]pyrene in heat-treated foods. The highest benzo[a]pyrene levels were found in animal source samples such as charcoal-grilled and smoked meats, especially pork, beef and sausage, while trace levels of benzo[a]pyrene were present in grain food. Charcoal-grilled vegetables were found to also contain certain levels of benzo[a]pyrene. This study provided new information on benzo[a]pyrene content of a variety of heat-treated foods from China.© 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84872136233	Antioxidant capacities, phenolic compounds and polysaccharide contents of 49 edible macro-fungi	Edible macro-fungi are widely consumed as food sources for their flavors and culinary features. In order to explore the potential of macro-fungi as a natural resource of bioactive compounds, the antioxidant properties and polysaccharide contents of 49 edible macro-fungi from China were evaluated systematically. A positive correlation between antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content indicated that phenolic compounds could be main contributors of antioxidant capacities of these macro-fungi. Furthermore, many bioactive compounds such as gallic, homogentisic, protocatechuic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were identified and quantified. The macro-fungi species Thelephora ganbajun Zang, Boletus edulis Bull., Volvariella volvacea Sing, Boletus regius Krombh, and Suillus bovinus Kuntze displayed the highest antioxidant capacities and total phenolic contents, indicating their potential as important dietary sources of natural antioxidants. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84873245168	Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) variants confer risk of diabetes in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study	Objective: Published data concerning associations between IRS1 variants and type 2 diabetes and related traits have been inconsistent. We examined the relationship between common variants in IRS1, type 2 diabetes, and related traits including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and DNA damage in the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study. Methods: We genotyped six common IRS1 variants in an adult Puerto Rican population (n=1132) and tested for association with risk of type 2 diabetes and related traits. Results: SNPs rs934167 and rs1801123 showed significant association with fasting glucose concentrations (p = 0.005 and p = 0.016, respectively) and rs934167 showed significant association with plasma insulin levels (p = 0.005). Carriers of the rs934167 minor allele had significantly higher HOMA-IR and lower QUICKI (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively), and a 40% and 58% greater likelihood of being hyperglycaemic or hyperinsulinemic (OR = 1.40 and 1.58; p = 0.013 and 0.002, respectively). However, they exhibited only a marginally significant trend towards having type 2 diabetes (OR=1.27, p = 0.077). Furthermore, carriers of the haplotype C-T of the rs934167 and rs1801123 minor alleles showed consistent patterns of associations after correction for multiple testing. In addition, the G972R (rs1801278) minor allele was significantly associated with higher urinary 8-OHdG concentrations (p = 0.020) and plasma CRP levels (p = 0.035). Conclusions: Our results support IRS1 variants associated with type 2 diabetes risk in adult Puerto Ricans. Moreover, we report the novel finding that IRS1 variant G972R (rs1801278) may contribute to oxidative DNA damage and inflammation.

84878012070	Lycopene suppresses proinflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages by inhibiting ROS-induced trafficking of TLR4 to lipid raft-like domains	We recently showed that lycopene inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced productions of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in murine RAW264.7 macrophages by mechanisms related to inhibition of ERK and nuclear factor-κB. Since the assembly of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in lipid rafts is a key element in LPS induced signaling, we investigated whether this process would be influenced by lycopene. We found that pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with lycopene inhibited LPS-induced recruitment of TLR4 into fractions - enriched with lipid raft marker. By the methods of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, we also found that lycopene inhibited the subsequent formation of the complex of TLR4 with its adaptors including myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88 and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-β. We also found that the lycopene induced inhibition was associated with reduced formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was an upstream mechanism for the effects of lycopene, because treating the cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-. l-cysteine and NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride significantly inhibited LPS-induced recruitment of TLR4 into lipid raft-like domains as well as the production of proinflammatory molecule NO and IL-6. Thus, our findings suggest that lycopene may prevent LPS-induced TLR4 assembly into lipid rafts through reducing intracellular ROS level. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84878123559	Estimated daily flavonoid and stilbene intake from fruits, vegetables, and nuts and associations with lipid profiles in chinese adults	Background: The scientific evidence for the association of daily flavonoid and stilbene intakes with cardiovascular risk factors in Chinese adults has not been reported previously. Objective: The aim of the study was to assess daily flavonoid and stilbene intakes and evaluate these compounds' association with cardiovascular risk factors such as serum lipids and carotid intima-media thickness in Chinese adults. Design: A total of 1,393 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study from July 2008 to January 2010 in China. Dietary flavonoid and stilbene intakes as well as overall dietary intakes from foods and beverages were assessed with a quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements and cardiovascular risk factors including serum lipids, uric acid, and carotid intima-media thickness were examined. The relationship between flavonoids and stilbene intakes and these cardiovascular risk factors was examined using either partial correlation coefficients or analysis of covariance. Results: The richest sources of flavonoids and stilbenes were the fruit group including apple, plum, pear, and peach, followed by the vegetable group containing lotus root and taro. The daily intake of total flavonoids, anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, and stilbene were 165.6 mg/day, 27.6 mg/day, 123.7 mg/day, 10.7 mg/day, 3.7 mg/day, and 0.3 mg/day, respectively. Higher daily consumption of anthocyanidins was associated with elevated serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (P trend=0.001), and higher total flavonoid and flavonol intakes were associated with lower serum triglycerides (TG) concentrations (P trend=0.020 and P trend=0.035, respectively) and TG/HDL-C ratios (P trend=0.040 and P trend=0.045, respectively) in female subjects. These significant relationships were not found in male subjects. Conclusions: The daily intakes of flavonoid and stilbene were estimated in the present study, and higher dietary flavonoid intake was associated with improving lipid profile in Chinese women. The results indicate that dietary flavonoids may have beneficial effect on preventing cardiovascular diseases. © 2013 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

84879321542	Association between serum interleukin-6 concentration and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease	Objectives. To evaluate whether serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) is associated with increased risk of mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Methods. We performed a prospective cohort study of 718 CAD patients from the Guangzhou Cardiovascular Disease Cohort (GCDC) study. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to examine the association between serum IL-6 with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Results. During the 1663 person-years of followup, the cumulative all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were 6.5% (n = 47) and 3.3% (n = 24), respectively. The mean length of followup was 2.32 ± 0.81 years. In the multivariable analyses, a one-SD increment in log-transformed serum IL-6 was positively associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with hazard ratios (HR) of 2.93 (95% CI, 2.11-4.08) and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.34-3.68) within the patients combined and 2.98 (95% CI, 2.12-4.18) and 3.10 (95% CI, 1.98-4.85) within males, respectively. Patients in the highest serum IL-6 tertile versus the lowest tertile were at higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with HR of 17.12 (95% CI 3.11-71.76) and 8.68 (95% CI, 1.88-37.51), respectively. Conclusions. In hospitalized patients with CAD, serum IL-6 is significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. © 2013 Dongfang Su et al.

84879031513	A randomized controlled trial to evaluate the relative efficacy of the addition of a psycho-social intervention to standard-of-care services in reducing attrition and improving attendance among first-time users of methadone maintenance treatment in China	Although methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is an important means of HIV control, MMT clinics commonly have high attrition rates. The randomized controlled trial investigated the relative efficacy of adding a psycho-social intervention to the standard-of-care MMT in reducing attrition and non-attendance among first-time newly admitted MMT users in China (n = 288). Social workers implemented this three-phase intervention that was based on a behavioral maintenance theory. It also involved participants' family members and rectified some MMT-related misconceptions. As compared to the control group, the intervention group showed significantly lower likelihood of attrition (HR = 0.55, 95 % confidence interval 0.39-0.80), lower estimated probability of attrition at Month 12 (0.35 vs. 0.55), and higher median number of days of attendance (Month 6: 147 vs. 91 days, p < 0.001; end-date: 225 vs. 142 days, p < 0.001).

84880511215	Antiproliferative activity of peels, pulps and seeds of 61 fruits	Fruits are wildly consumed and considered to have various health benefits. The aim of this study was to supply new information on the antiproliferative function of selected fruits for nutritionists and the general public. The in vitro antiproliferative activities of the peels, pulps and seeds of 61 fruits on four cancer cell lines, A549 (human lung cancer cells), MCF-7 (human breast cancer cells), HepG2 (human hepatoma cells) and HT-29 (human colon cancer cells) were evaluated by MTT assay. The results revealed that different fruits and different parts of one fruit exhibited different antiproliferative capacities. Nine of the 162 samples from 61 fruits showed remarkable inhibitory effects toward the four cancer cell lines, and all decreased the viability of the cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggested that some fruits (such as honey peach, salak, orange, and Peru ground cherry) may serve as potential dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of cancer because of strong antiproliferative activities against the cancer cell lines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Allelic analysis showed that allele A of rs10118757 was associated with increased risk of CAD, with OR (95%CI). = 1.193 (1.035-1.376), and P= 0.015. After adjusted for age, BMI, gender, hypertension and smoking, rs10118757 was still significantly associated with CAD under additive and dominant models, with OR (95%CI). = 1.252 (1.070-1.465), P= 0.005, and OR (95%CI). = 1.698 (1.168-2.467), P= 0.006, respectively. Compared to additive model, dominant model may be the best-fitting model (P= 6.63E. -. 10 vs P= 6.70E. -. 10). As reported previously, rs10118757 was not associated with MI in the current study.Our study firstly reported that SNP rs10118757 was associated with CAD risk in a Chinese Han population, indicating that MTAP gene may play a potential role in the pathophysiological process of CAD. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Body weight and height, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC) were measured and body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were calculated. Body fat (and percentage of fat) over the whole body and the trunk were determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Blood pressure, fasting lipid profiles, and glucose and urine acid levels were assessed.Results:In women, the ROC and the multivariate logistic regression analyses both showed that WHtR consistently had the best performance in identifying hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, diabetes/IFG, and metabolic syndrome (MetS). In men, the ROC analysis showed that WHtR was the best predictor of hypertension, WHtR and WC were equally good predictors of dyslipidemia and MetS, and WHtR was the second-best predictor of hyperuricemia and diabetes/IFG. The multivariate logistic regression also found WHtR to be superior in discriminating between MetS, diabetes/IFG, and dyslipidemia while BMI performed better in predicting hypertension and hyperuricemia in men. The BIA-derived indices were the second-worst predictors for all of the endpoints, and HC was the worst.Conclusion:WHtR was the best predictor of various metabolic abnormalities. BMI may be used as an alternative measure of obesity for identifying hypertension in both sexes. © 2013 Zhang et al.

84881026159	Retinol binding protein 4 stimulates hepatic sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and increases lipogenesis through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1β-dependent pathway	Recent studies have revealed the essential role of retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) in insulin resistance. However, the impact of RBP4 on aberrant lipogenesis, the common hepatic manifestation in insulin resistance states, and the underlying mechanism remain elusive. The present study was designed to examine the effect of RBP4 on sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1) and hepatic lipogenesis. Treatment with human retinol-bound RBP4 (holo-RBP4) significantly induced intracellular triglyceride (TAG) synthesis in HepG2 cells and this effect is retinol-independent. Furthermore, RBP4 treatment enhanced the levels of mature SREBP-1 and its nuclear translocation, thereby increasing the expression of lipogenic genes, including fatty acid synthase (FAS), acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase-1 (ACC-1), and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT-2). Stimulation of HepG2 cells with RBP4 strongly up-regulated the expression of transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) at both the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. The transcriptional activation of PGC-1β is necessary and sufficient for the transcriptional activation of SREBP-1 in response to RBP4. The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) was identified as the target transcription factor involved in the RBP4-mediated up-regulation of PGC-1β transcription as a result of phosphorylation on Ser133. Furthermore, in vivo RBP4 infusion induced SREBP-1c activation and consequently accelerated hepatic lipogenesis and plasma TAG in C57BL/6J mice, a phenomenon not observed in Ppargc1b knockout mice. Conclusion: These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which RBP4 achieves its effects on hepatic lipid metabolism. © 2013 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

84881506662	Cytochrome P4502E1 inhibitor, chlormethiazole, decreases lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation in rat Kupffer cells with ethanol treatment	Aim: To investigate the role of Cytochrome P4502E1 in sensitizing Kupffer cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammation after ethanol induction. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a liquid ethanol diet, control diet or ethanol diet supplemented with CYP2E1 inhibitor, chlormethiazole (CMZ), for 4weeks. Hepatic CYP2E1 protein, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 protein and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA were measured. In vitro, isolated Kupffer cells from control rats were exposed to ethanol with different CMZ concentration; CYP2E1 expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were compared. The identified CMZ concentration was further utilized to evaluate the role of CYP2E1 on the sensitization of ethanol-induced Kupffer cell to LPS. The effect of LPS alone was tested in controlled Kupffer cells without ethanol. TNF-α, nuclear NF-κB p65 and cytoplasm IκB-α were monitored for all groups. Results: Ethanol feeding increased hepatic CYP2E1 level, nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65 and TNF-α expression in rats. These changes were inhibited by CMZ supplementation. In cultured Kupffer cells, increased CYP2E1 content and ROS production by in vitro ethanol induction were dose-dependently inhibited by CMZ. Compared with LPS alone, the ethanol induction group produced significantly more TNF-α, nuclear NF-κB p65 and less cytoplasm IκB-α under LPS stimuli. CMZ abolished the effects of ethanol on LPS-stimulated NF-κB translocation and TNF-α generation in Kupffer cells. Conclusion: In cultured Kupffer cell, using CMZ as inhibitor, ethanol-induced CYP2E1 overexpression was proved to contribute to the sensitization of Kupffer cells to LPS stimuli, with amplification of ROS production and activation of NF-κB, resulting in increased TNF-α production. © 2013 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

84883167142	Circulating Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 Is Associated with Angiographic Severity and Extent of Coronary Artery Disease	Objective:Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a circulating regulator of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and is associated with coronary artery calcification, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine whether circulating FGF23 concentration is independently associated with the severity and extent of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing coronary angiography.Method:A cross-sectional design was used to examine the relationship between serum FGF23 and the severity and extent of coronary artery stenosis in 2076 patients undergoing coronary angiography (1263 male and 813 female, mean aged 62.5 years). Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the associations between FGF23 and coronary arterial plaque characteristics evaluated by intravascular ultrasound and 12-month incidence of target vessel revascularization (TVR) and target lesion revascularization (TLR).Findings:We found a stepwise increase of serum FGF23 concentrations in patients with mild, moderate, severe stenosis or with increased number of stenotic vessels compared with those without stenosis (P<0.001). Serum FGF23 concentration was positively correlated with stenosis scores as the global index of the severity and extent of coronary artery stenosis in both male and female (r = 0.315 and r = 0.291, P<0.001). In multiple regression analyses, serum FGF23 concentration was a significant determinant of the stenosis scores independent of other traditional risk factors (standardized β = 0.326, P<0.001). Furthermore, subgroup analyses found FGF23 was significantly associated with plaque and dense calcium volumes. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that serum FGF23 levels were significantly independent predictors of TVR and TLR.Conclusions:We report an independent association between circulating FGF23 concentration and the severity and extent of coronary artery stenosis in the coronary angiographic patients. Future studies are needed to elucidate the potential biological mechanisms and whether FGF23 is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. © 2013 Xiao et al.

It has been reported that overloaded iron stores are positively associated with increased coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, which is called the "iron-heart hypothesis". Previous studies evaluating the relationships between fatty acids (FAs) and body iron status only focused on participants with iron deficiency. However, whether FA composition is related to overloaded iron remains unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the relationships between erythrocyte membrane FA (Ery-FA) composition and overloaded body iron status as measured by plasma ferritin levels in Chinese CAD patients. A total of 446 subjects with angiographically identified CAD (mean age 63.1 years, 76.9% males) were recruited in a hospital between 2009 and 2010. Ery-FAs were measured by gas chromatography and the activities of FA desaturases, which are involved in the de novo synthesis of unsaturated FAs, were evaluated by using FA product-to-precursor ratios. Results showed that the average iron status was a bit overloaded in the population (median ferritin levels of 234.1 ng mL

84884162151	Anti-inflammatory effect of purified dietary anthocyanin in adults with hypercholesterolemia: A randomized controlled trial	Background and aim: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and previous studies have demonstrated that anthocyanin inhibits atherosclerosis. In the present study, we explored the effects of anthocyanins on inflammatory cytokines in hypercholesterolemic adults and cell lines. Methods and results: A total of 150 subjects with hypercholesterolemia consumed a purified anthocyanin mixture (320mg/d) or a placebo twice a day for 24 weeks in a randomized, double-blind trial. Anthocyanin consumption significantly decreased the levels of serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (-21.6% vs. -2.5%, P=0.001), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) (-12.3% vs. 0.4%, P=0.005) and plasma IL-1β (-12.8% vs. -1.3%, P=0.019) compared to the placebo. We also found a significant difference in the LDL-cholesterol (-10.4% vs. 0.3%, P=0.030) and HDL-cholesterol level changes (14.0% vs. -0.9%, P=0.036) between the two groups. In cell culture assays invitro, purified anthocyanin mixture, delphinidin-3-Ο-β-glucoside (Dp-3g) and cyanidin-3-Ο-β-glucoside (Cy-3g) inhibited IL-6 and IL-1β-induced CRP production (P<0.05) in HepG2 cell line and LPS-induced VCAM-1 secretion (P<0.05) in porcine iliac artery endothelial cell line respectively in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the reduction of inflammatory cytokines associated with anthocyanin mixture was stronger when compared with the effects of Dp-3g and Cy-3g separately (P<0.05). Conclusions: Anthocyanin mixture reduced the inflammatory response in hypercholesterolemic subjects. In addition, different anthocyanin compounds were found to have additive or synergistic effects in mediating anti-inflammatory responses invitro cell culture assays. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84884207787	The association between smoking quantity and hypertension mediated by inflammation in Chinese current smokers	Objectives: Previous studies indicated that cigarette smokers were more likely to develop hypertension, and both smoking and hypertension were associated with inflammation. Whether inflammation mediates the relationship of them is unclear. This study aims to examine whether inflammation mediates the association between smoking and hypertension. Methods: Nine hundred and eighty-four Chinese current smokers from a community-based chronic diseases survey in Guangzhou and Zhuhai were interviewed about sociodemographics, smoking, chronic conditions, and other health-related variables. Hypertension was defined according to 2007 European Society of Hypertension and European Society of Cardiology (ESH-ESC) Practice Guidelines. Inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1b, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were measured by flow cytometry. Logistic regressions were performed to assess the mediation of inflammation on the relationship between smoking quantity and hypertension. Results: We observed a positive association between smoking quantity and hypertension (P<0.05). After controlling for potential confounders, daily cigarette consumption was significantly associated with higher level of CRP and VCAM-1 and lower level of TNF-α among six measured inflammatory markers, and the current smokers with hypertension had significantly higher level of MCP-1 and CRP than those smokers who were normotensive. Furthermore, the association between smoking quantity and hypertension was mediated by CRP, which accounted for 58.59% of the estimated causal effect of smoking on hypertension. Conclusion: We have confirmed previous observations that smoking quantity was positively associated with hypertension, and the results of our study suggested that the association between smoking and hypertension was probably mediated by CRP. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84886393470	Effects of blood triglycerides on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies	The relationship of triglycerides (TG) to the risk of death remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to determine the associations between blood triglyceride levels and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) mortality and all-cause mortality. Four databases were searched without language restriction for relevant studies: PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. All prospective cohort studies reporting an association between TG and CVDs or all-cause mortality published before July 2013 were included. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled according to TG categories, unit TG, and logarithm of TG using a random-effects model with inverse-variance weighting. We identified 61 eligible studies, containing 17,018 CVDs deaths in 726,030 participants and 58,419 all-cause deaths in 330,566 participants. Twelve and fourteen studies, respectively, reported the effects estimates of CVDs and total mortality by TG categories. Compared to the referent (90-149 mg/dL), the pooled RRs (95% CI) of CVDs mortality for the lowest (< 90 mg/dL), borderline-high (150-199 mg/dL), and high TG (≥ 200 mg/dL) groups were 0.83 (0.75 to 0.93), 1.15 (1.03 to 1.29), and 1.25 (1.05 to 1.50); for total mortality they were 0.94 (0.85 to 1.03), 1.09 (1.02 to 1.17), and 1.20 (1.04 to 1.38), respectively. The risks of CVDs and all-cause deaths were increased by 13% and 12% (p < 0.001) per 1-mmol/L TG increment in twenty-two and twenty-two studies reported RRs per unit TG, respectively. In conclusion, elevated blood TG levels were dose-dependently associated with higher risks of CVDs and all-cause mortality.©2013 Liu et al.;licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84886240904	Specificity of miR-378a-5p targeting rodent fibronectin	One criterion for microRNA identification is based on their conservation across species, and prediction of miRNA targets by empirical approaches using computational analysis relies on the presence of conservative mRNA 3'UTR. Because most miRNA target sites identified are highly conserved across different species, it is not clear whether miRNA targeting is species-specific. To predict miRNA targeting, we aligned all available fibronectin 3'UTRs and observed significant conservation of all 20 species. Twelve miRNAs were predicted to target most fibronectin 3'UTRs, but rodent fibronectin showed potential binding sites specific for five different miRNAs. One of them, the miR-378a-5p, contained a complete matching seed-region for all rodent fibronectin, which could not be found in any other species. We designed experiments to test whether the species-specific targeting possessed biological function and found that expression of miR-378a-5p decreased cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. Silencing fibronectin expression produced similar effects as miR-378a-5p, while transfection with a construct targeting miR-378-5p produced opposite results. Tumor formation assay showed that enhanced expression of fibronectin in the stromal tissues as a background environment suppressed tumor growth, while increased fibronectin expression inside the tumor cells promoted tumor growth. This was likely due to the different signaling direction, either inside-out or outside-in signal. Our results demonstrated that species-specific targeting by miRNA could also exert functional effects. Thus, one layer of regulation has been added to the complex network of miRNA signaling. © 2013.

84886667243	The prevalence and awareness of cardiometabolic risk factors in southern chinese population with coronary artery disease	Background. Cardiometabolic risk factors significantly accelerate the progression of coronary artery disease (CAD); however, whether CAD patients in South China are aware of the prevalence of these risk factors is not clear yet. Methods. The study consisted of 2312 in-admission CAD patients from 2008 to 2011 in South China. Disease history including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes was relied on patients' self-reported records. Physical and clinical examinations were tested to assess the real prevalence of the cardiometabolic risk factors. Results. 57.9% of CAD patients had more than 3 cardiometabolic risk factors in terms of the metabolic syndrome. The self-known and real prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were 56.6%, 28.3%, and 25.1% and 91.3%, 40.9%, and 92.0%, respectively. The awareness rates were 64.4%, 66.3%, and 28.5% for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors was significantly different among gender and among disease status. Conclusions. Most CAD patients in South China had more than three cardiometabolic risk factors. However, the awareness rate of cardiometabolic diseases was low, especially for dyslipidemia. Strategies of routine physical examination programs are needed for the early detection and treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors in order to prevent CAD progression and prognosis. © 2013 Xinrui Li et al.

84886303845	Plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine is associated with the risk of cardiovascular events in patients undergoing coronary angiography: A cohort study	Background: Although cross-sectional studies have shown that plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the metabolic precursor of homocysteine, is associated with cardiovascular disease, the prospective relation between plasma SAH and cardiovascular disease risk is unknown. Objective: The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the association between plasma SAH and cardiovascular disease risk in coronary angiography patients. Design: Baseline plasma SAH and homocysteine concentrations were measured in 1003 patients aged between 21 and 87 y who underwent coronary angiography. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the association between SAH and homocysteine and the risk of cardiovascular events, including fatal cardiovascular diseases, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Results: During the median follow-up period of 3.0 y, 93 participants developed cardiovascular events (32.7/1000 person-years). The age-and sex-adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular events was 3.38 (95% CI: 2.12, 5.39) for each 1-SD increase in the natural log-transformed SAH concentration. The age-and sex-adjusted hazard ratios of cardiovascular events across quartiles of SAH concentrations were 1.0, 2.25, 2.72, and 3.40 (P-trend = 0.007). Further adjustment for other cardiovascular disease risk factors and plasma homocysteine affected the results only slightly. This positive association between SAH and cardiovascular disease risk did not change when participants were stratified by age group, sex, and other baseline covariates. The results among a subset of participants with significant coronary stenosis were similar. Conclusion: Higher concentrations of plasma SAH are independently associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events among patients undergoing coronary angiography.

84887106923	Dietary protein and plasma total homocysteine, cysteine concentrations in coronary angiographic subjects	Background: Dietary patterns are associated with plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in healthy populations, but the associations between dietary protein and tHcy, total cysteine (tCys) in high risk populations are unclear. We therefore examined the association between dietary protein and tHcy and tCys concentrations in coronary angiographic subjects. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1015 Chinese patients who underwent coronary angiography (40-85 y old). With the use of food-frequency questionnaires, we divided the total protein intakes into high animal-protein and high plant-protein diets. Circulating concentrations of tHcy and tCys were simultaneously measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Results: We found that high animal-protein diet was positively associated with hyperhomocysteinemia after adjustment for potential confounders, with the subjects in the highest quartile of intake having the greatest increase in risk (OR: 4.14, 95% CI: 2.67-6.43), whereas high plant-protein diet was inversely related to hyperhomocysteinemia, with a higher intake being protective. Compared with the first quartile of intake, the adjusted OR was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38-0.91) for the fourth quartile. The total protein intake was positively associated with the risk of hypercysteinemia and the participants in highest quartile had significant OR of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.02-2.87) compared with those in lowest quartile. In multivariate linear regression analyses, high animal-protein and total-protein intakes were positively associated with plasma tHcy and tCys concentrations. The plant-protein intake was a negative determinant of plasma tHcy concentrations. Conclusions: High animal-protein diet was positively associated with high tHcy concentrations, whereas high plant-protein diet was inversely associated with tHcy concentrations. Furthermore the total protein intake was strongly related to tCys concentrations. © 2013 Xiao et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0141519075	The p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) tumor-suppressor gene in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A promoter methylation and protein expression study in 100 cases	The p16 (CDKN2a/INK4a) gene is an important tumor-suppressor gene, involved in the p16/cyclin-dependent kinase/retinoblastoma gene pathway of cell cycle control. The p16 protein is considered to be a negative regulator of the pathway. The gene encodes an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, which regulate the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma gene and the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. In the present study, p16 gene promoter hypermethylation patterns and p16 protein expression were analyzed in 100 consecutive untreated cases of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemical staining. The p16 promoter hypermethylation and apparent loss of p16 protein expression were detected in 27% and 74% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. By X

0041512056	Black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) pigmented fraction suppresses both reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide in chemical and biological model systems	Anthocyanins, present in fruits and vegetables as natural colorants, have been well characterized to possess bioactive properties. Anthocyanin components extracted from black rice (Oryza sativa L. indica) separated by gel filtration and identified using LC-MS were cyanidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-glucoside. A standardized extract of black rice pigmented fraction (BRE) containing known proportions of cyanidin 3-glucoside and peonidin 3-glucoside exhibited marked antioxidant activities and free radical scavenging capacities in a battery of in vitro model systems, Significant (p < 0.05) prevention of supercoiled DNA strand scission induced by reactive oxygen species (specifically, peroxyl radical and hydroxyl radicals) and suppression of the oxidative modification of human low-density lipoprotein was obtained with BRE. In addition, BRE reduced (p < 0.05) the formation of nitric oxide by suppressing inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells, without introducing cell toxicity. The results of this study show that black rice contains anthocyanin pigments with notable antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties for potential use in nutraceutical or functional food formulations.

0142093596	Metabolic partitioning of endogenous fatty acid in adipocytes	Objective: To develop an accurate new method to measure the partitioning of adipocyte endogenous fatty acids among different metabolic pathways, a critical step toward understanding the regulatory mechanism by which fat disposition is modulated. Research Methods and Procedures: Isolated primary rat adipocytes were pre-incubated with isotope-labeled fatty acids. This allows determination of the specific activity of labeled fatty acids in the endogenous lipid pool. After the removal of exogenous fatty acids, the disposition of endogenous fatty acids into the three major metabolic pathways, namely, oxidation, re-esterification, and release into the medium, was measured independently. This was compared with the total lipolytic release of endogenous fatty acids, as measured by glycerol release. Adipocytes from normal fed and fasted animals were used to determine the effects of physiological variations on the metabolic fate of endogenous fatty acids. Results: In normal fed animals, 0.2% of endogenous fatty acids were oxidized, 50.1% were released, and 49.7% were re-esterified. Fasting doubled the partitioning of fatty acids toward oxidation (p < 0.05) in association with increased lipolysis (1.4-fold increase) (p < 0.05). This effect was completely abolished by the addition of insulin to the cells (61% reduction) (p < 0.05). Discussion: The endogenous fatty acids in adipocytes are actively oxidized. This process can be regulated by altered physiological conditions or by insulin. Over time, it is possible that a small shift of fatty acids toward oxidation could have a significant impact on body fuel economy. This hypothesis needs to be tested. Copyright © 2003 NAASO.

84890202863	Effectiveness of school-based smoking intervention in middle school students of Linzhi Tibetan and Guangzhou Han ethnicity in China	Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of school-based intervention aimed to increase knowledge, to change attitudes and to reduce smoking-related behavior in both Linzhi Tibetan and Guangzhou Han middle school students in China. Design: A concurrent intervention study was conducted in both Linzhi and Guangzhou. Two schools were randomly chosen and one was randomly assigned to the intervention group and the other to the control group in both settings. Setting/participants: Participants were grade one and grade two middle school students drawn from two schools in Linzhi, Tibet Autonomous Region (southwest China) and two schools in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province (south China). Intervention: The intervention program lasted for one year and covered three aspects: health policies in school, health environment in school and personal health skills. Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were smoking-related knowledge, attitudes and behavior (including ever smoking, daily smoking, weekly smoking and current smoking) and were measured by a self-administered questionnaire before and after the intervention. Results: This intervention increased smoking-related knowledge in both Tibetan (β=1.32, 95% CI (0.87-1.77)) and Han ethnic groups (β=0.47, 95% CI (0.11-0.83)). It changed attitudes toward smoking in Tibetan (β=1.47, 95% CI (0.06-2.87)) but not so in Han (β=0.33, 95% CI (1.68-1.01)). The intervention changed the prevalence of smoking in neither ethnic groups (P>. 0.05). Conclusions: The impact of school-based smoking intervention is different among Tibetan and Han students. This intervention was more effective for Tibetans when compared with the Han ethnic group. More research is needed on how intervention can be adapted to address ethnic and cultural differences. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84891125302	Effects of bayberry juice on inflammatory and apoptotic markers in young adults with features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease	Objective: Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Bayberries contain high levels of polyphenols that possess antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties invitro. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the consumption of bayberry juice beneficially alters the levels of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic biomarkers in young individuals with features of NAFLD. Methods: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, 44 participants (ages 18-25 y) were given 250 mL of either bayberry juice or placebo twice daily for 4 wk. Several anthropometric characteristics were measured, and fasting blood samples were drawn before and after each intervention period. The levels of plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, and some NAFLD-related biomarkers were determined. Results: No significant effects on the anthropometric parameters and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were observed. Compared with placebo, the consumption of bayberry juice significantly decreased the plasma levels of protein carbonyl groups (P = 0.038), tumor necrosis factor-α (P < 0.001), and interleukin-8 (P = 0.022). The apoptosis markers analysis revealed significant differences between the treatment and the placebo in the levels of tissue polypeptide-specific antigen (P < 0.001) and cytokeratin-18 fragment M30 (P < 0.001). Conclusion: The consumption of bayberry juice for a period of 4 wk can protect against NAFLD in young adults by improving the plasma antioxidant status and inhibiting the inflammatory and apoptotic responses that are involved in this disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84893074531	Hyperglycemia and mortality among patients with coronary artery disease	OBJECTIVE Known diabetes is an independent predictor for mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients; however, whether other glucose abnormalities are associated with death risk in CAD patients is unclear. The goal of this study was to examine the association between different glucose states and the risks of allcause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among CAD patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The study cohort included 1,726 CAD patients who were 40-85 years of age in the Guangdong Coronary Artery Disease Cohort. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of baseline glucose status with risk of mortality. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 129 deaths were recorded, 109 of which were due to CVD. The multivariable-adjusted (age; sex; education; marriage; leisure-time physical activity; smoking; alcohol drinking; BMI; systolic blood pressure; total and HDL cholesterol; glomerular filtration rate; type, severity, duration, and treatment of CAD; history of heart failure; and use of antihypertensive, cholesterol-lowering, and antiplatelet drugs) hazard ratios in normoglycemia, impaired glucose regulation (IGR), newly diagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes were 1.00, 1.58 (95% CI 0.90-2.77), 2.41 (1.42-4.11), and 2.29 (1.36-3.84) for allcause mortality and 1.00, 1.89 (1.01-3.54), 2.74 (1.50-5.01), and 2.73 (1.52-4.91) for CVD mortality. Assessing fasting plasma glucose only, impaired fasting glucose and newly diagnosed and known diabetes were also associated with increased risks of all-cause and CVD mortality compared with normoglycemia.

84893798702	Betaine attenuates hepatic steatosis by reducing methylation of the MTTP promoter and elevating genomic methylation in mice fed a high-fat diet	Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to the abnormality of hepatic gene expression, one of the main factors in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Betaine is a methyl donor and has been considered to be a lipotropic agent. However, whether betaine supplementation improves NAFLD via its effect on the DNA methylation of specific genes and the genome has not been explored. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a control diet or high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with 0%, 1% and 2% betaine in water (wt/vol) for 12 weeks. Betaine supplementation ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in a dose-dependent manner. HFD up-regulated FAS and ACOX messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and down-regulated PPARα, ApoB and MTTP mRNA expression; however, these alterations were reversed by betaine supplementation, except ApoB. MTTP mRNA expression was negatively correlated with the DNA methylation of its CpG sites at -184, -156, -63 and -60. Methylation of these CpG sites was lower in both the 1% and 2% betaine-supplemented groups than in the HFD group (averages; 25.55% and 14.33% vs. 30.13%). In addition, both 1% and 2% betaine supplementation significantly restored the methylation capacity [. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) concentration and SAM/. S-adenosylhomocysteine ratios] and genomic methylation level, which had been decreased by HFD (0.37% and 0.47% vs. 0.25%). These results suggest that the regulation of aberrant DNA methylation by betaine might be a possible mechanism of the improvements in NAFLD upon betaine supplementation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

84898617947	Comparison of predictive value of cardiometabolic indices for subclinical atherosclerosis in chinese adults	Objectives: Metabolic disturbances are well-known risk factors for atherosclerosis, but it remains unclear which cardiometabolic components are the predominant determinants. This study aimed to compare and identify the key determinants of carotid atherosclerosis in asymptomatic middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study including 3,162 apparently healthy residents aged 37-75 years was performed from July 2008 to June 2010 in Guangzhou, China. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) was assessed by B-mode ultrasound, and increased IMT was defined as IMT > 1.00 mm. Obesity indices, blood pressure, fasting blood lipids, glucose and uric acid levels were determined. Principal components factor analysis was used to extract common factors underlying 11 metabolic factors. Results: Four common factors, defined as "adiposity," "blood lipids," "triglycerides/uric acid (TG/UA)" (in men) or "triglycerides/uric acid/glucose (TG/UA/Glu)" (in women), and "blood pressure," were retained for both sexes. After adjustment for potential covariates, the "adiposity" factor showed the strongest positive association with increased IMT in men. Comparing the extreme quartiles, ORs (95% CI) of increased IMT were 4.64 (2.04-10.59) at the CCA and 2.37 (1.54-3.64) at the BIF), followed by "blood pressure", the corresponding OR (95% CI) was 2.85 (1.37-5.90) at the CCA. Whereas, the four common factors showed comparable and weak relationship with increased IMTs, the ORs for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 varied from 0.89 to 3.59 in women. Conclusions: Among the metabolic factors, "adiposity" and "blood pressure" play predominant roles in the presence of carotid atherosclerosis in men, but no key factor is identified in women. © 2014 Xu et al.

84902257342	Serum lipids, apolipoproteins, and mortality among coronary artery disease patients	The proatherogenic effect of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and antiatherogenic effect of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been confirmed in general population. But controversy arises among coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The goal of this study was to identify the association of different lipid measurements with CAD prognosis. The study cohort included 1916 CAD patients who were 40-85 years of age. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association of baseline 6 lipid factors and 3 ratios with all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years, 147 deaths were recorded, 113 of which were due to CVD. When lipid factors were categorized, HDL-C showed a U-shape association with all-cause and CVD mortality after adjustment for major CVD risk factors. Serum LDL-C, apoB, LDL/HDL ratio, and apoB/apoA-I ratio were positively, and apoA-I level was inversely associated with the risk of CVD mortality. After further pairwise comparison of lipid-related risk, LDL/HDL ratio and LDL-C had stronger association with all-cause and CVD mortality than other proatherogenic measurements among Chinese CAD patients. © 2014 Ding Ding et al.

84904580721	Higher erythrocyte n-3 PUFAs are associated with decreased blood pressure in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults	Previous studies suggested that blood fatty acids (FAs) might affect blood pressure (BP), but the findings have been inconclusive. This study evaluated the cross-sectional and prospective associations of erythrocyte FAs with BP in middleaged and elderly Chinese individuals. Between 2008 and 2010, 1834 participants (1364 women and 470 men) aged 57 ± 5 y had baseline measurements taken of their erythrocyte FAs and BP. A total of 1477 participants (1103 women and 374 men) had their BP measured again after 3.09 ± 0.32 y (range: 2.91-3.26 y). In the cross-sectional analyses (n = 1834), the erythrocyte saturated FA (SFA) content was positively associated with BP, whereas total cis polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs), their subtypes cis n-3 (ω-3) PUFAs and cis n-6 (ω-6) PUFAs, and the PUFA-to-SFA ratio were inversely associated with BP (all P-trends < 0.05). The longitudinal results (n = 1477) showed marginally inverse associations between cis n-3 PUFAs and the n-3:n-6 PUFA ratio and BP. For individual cis n-3 PUFAs, higher contents of 20:5n-3, 22:5n-3, and 22:6n- 3 were significantly associated with reduced increases in SBP over time (the mean change range between quartile 4 and quartile 1 was -0.917 to -0.749 mm Hg for SBP; all P-trends < 0.01), and 20:5n-3 was inversely associated with DBP change (the mean change between quartile 4 and quartile 1 was -0.631; P-trend < 0.001). Path analyses suggested that the associations between cis n-3 PUFAs and BP might be mediated by decreasing serum triglycerides (TGs) and body mass index (BMI). Our findings revealed that a higher content of cis n-3 PUFAs (mainly very long-chain cis n-3 PUFAs) may benefit BP progress, probably mediated by decreasing serum TGs and BMI. © 2014 American Society for Nutrition.

84904907124	Mediation role of C-reactive protein on the association between smoking quantity and type 2 diabetes in current Chinese smokers	Objective. Previous studies have indicated that cigarette smokers are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and that both smoking and type 2 diabetes are associated with C-reactive protein (CRP). This study examined whether CRP mediates the association between smoking quantity and type 2 diabetes. Methods. Nine hundred and eighty-four current Chinese smokers were selected from a community-based chronic disease survey conducted in Guangzhou and Zhuhai. Type 2 diabetes was defined according to the WHO 1999 criteria. CRP was measured with flow cytometry. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the mediation. Results. A positive association was observed between smoking quantity and type 2 diabetes (P<0.05). After controlling for potential confounders, daily cigarette consumption was significantly associated with higher CRP levels. Current smokers with type 2 diabetes had higher CRP levels than smokers without type 2 diabetes. The association between the smoking quantity and type 2 diabetes was mediated by CRP, which accounted for 50.77% of the association. Conclusions. This study provides further evidence that smoking quantity is positively associated with type 2 diabetes and suggests that the association between smoking and type 2 diabetes might be mediated by CRP. © 2014 Dan Feng,et al.

84905454725	Association of simple anthropometric indices and body fat with early atherosclerosis and lipid profiles in Chinese adults	Objective: The discriminatory capability of different adiposity indices for atherosclerosis and lipid abnormalities remains uncertain. This study aimed to identify the best adiposity index for predicting early atherosclerosis and abnormal lipid profiles among anthropometric parameters and body fat measures in middle-aged and elderly Chinese. Method: A total of 2,063 women and 814 men (57.6±5.2 y) were recruited for this community-based cross-sectional study. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were assessed. Body fat mass and its percentage values for the whole body and trunk were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The intima-media thicknesses (IMTs) of the common carotid arteries (CCA), internal carotid arteries (ICA) and bifurcation (BIF) were determined via B-mode ultrasound. The fasting lipid profiles were assessed. Results: With per SD increase of adiposity indices, the magnitude of the changes of IMT values and lipid profiles was more substantial for WC, WHR and WHtR in both genders. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that WC, WHR and WHtR were more sensitive in predicting the presence of intima-media thickening at the three segments as well as the lipids disturbances in women and men. In general, BIA-derived measures have no added predictive value for IMT-thickening as opposed to those three traditional abdominal measures. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that abdominal anthropometric measures including WC, WHR and WHtR are sensitive for discriminating carotid atherosclerosis and lipids abnormalities. WC is the best index because of its simplicity in routine use. © 2014 Zhang et al.

84905100700	The validity of the body adiposity index in predicting percentage body fat and cardiovascular risk factors among Chinese	Objective Recent research has suggested that body adiposity index (BAI) correlates more closely with percentage body fat (PBF) than body mass index (BMI). Here, we aimed to evaluate BAI's predictive power for PBF and for obesity-associated risk factors in the Chinese population. Subjects A total of 1707 women and 680 men aged 51-77 years were analysed in this community-based cross-sectional study. Measurements Body weight, height, waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC) were measured, and BMI and BAI were calculated. Percentage body fat was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Blood pressure, fasting lipid profiles, glucose and Carotid ultrasound examination determined intima-media thickness (IMT) at the common carotid arteries (CCA) were also measured. Results The Pearson correlation analysis indicated a stronger correlation between BAI and PBF when women and men were pooled together, but this effect disappeared in sex-stratified analysis. Bland-Altman plots suggested that BAI underestimated 5·8% of PBF in women and slightly overestimated 0·28% of PBF in men, but the magnitudes of these biases showed a fat mass-dependent manner.

84906769156	Coenzyme Q10 promotes macrophage cholesterol efflux by regulation of the activator protein-1/miR-378/ATP-binding cassette transporter G1-signaling pathway	OBJECTIVE - Recent studies have shown the role of miRNAs in macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and atherogenesis. We hypothesized that coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may increase macrophage reverse cholesterol transport by regulating miRNA expression that contributes to the prevention of atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS - CoQ10 treatment suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced macrophage foam cell formation by ameliorating the binding of activator protein-1 to the putative promoter region of miR-378 primary transcript, thus decreasing the miR-378 level and enhancing the ATP-binding cassette transporter G1-mediated macrophage cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein. Subsequently, the axis of activator protein-1/miR-378/ATP-binding cassette transporter G1 cholesterol efflux was confirmed in peritoneal macrophages isolated from CoQ10-treated apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Finally, CoQ10 consumption promoted macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and inhibited the progression of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. CONCLUSIONS - This study identified activator protein-1/miR-378/ATP- binding cassette transporter G1 as a novel cascade for CoQ10 in facilitating macrophage cholesterol efflux in vitro and in vivo. Our data thus imply that both CoQ10 and miR-378 are promising candidates for atherosclerosis prevention and treatment. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

84908073362	Effects and mechanisms of resveratrol on the amelioration of oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice	Background: The exact mechanism of the protective role of Resveratrol (Res) in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress is not well elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the potential benefits and possible mechanisms of Res on the amelioration of oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in a KKAy mouse model. Methods. A total of 30 KKAy male mice were randomly divided into three groups: a normal chow group, a low resveratrol group and a high resveratrol group. After a 12-wk study period, serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C and HDL-C, the liver content of TG and TC, ROS, GSH, GPx, SOD and MDA levels were measured. Ectopic lipid deposition was observed in sectioned frozen liver tissues. The mRNA levels of ATGL and HSL in the liver tissues were determined via real-time PCR. Furthermore, the protein expression of p47phox, gp91phox, ATGL, HSL, Sirt1, AMPK and FOXO1 were analyzed using western blotting. Results: Following Res supplementation, serum levels of TG and MDA were decreased, while the HDL-C and SOD levels were increased in KKAy mice. Furthermore, Res treatment increased GSH and GPx in liver tissues, while it decreased ROS. In addition, Res significantly reduced hepatic steatosis. After Res treatment, concentrations of p47phox (membrane) and gp91phox proteins were reduced, while p-HSL, HSL and ATGL protein expression levels were increased. Mechanistically, the levels of Sirt1, p-AMPK and p-FOXO1 expression in the liver tissues were up-regulated following supplementation with Res, and FOXO1 protein was released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Conclusions: Res is able to attenuate hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolic disorder and enhance the antioxidant ability in KKAy mice, possibly by up-regulating Sirt1 expression and the phosphorylation of AMPK.

84915804282	Higher serum carotenoid concentrations associated with a lower prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults	The association between serum carotenoids and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains uncertain, and little is known about this relationship in the Chinese population. The present study examined the association between serum carotenoid concentrations and the MetS in Chinese adults. We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study in which 2148 subjects (1547 women and 601 men) aged 50-75 years were recruited in urban Guangzhou, China. Dietary data and other covariates were collected during face-to-face interviews. Blood pressure, waist circumference, blood lipids, glucose and serum carotenoids (α-, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, lycopene and lutein/zeaxanthin) were examined. We found dose-response inverse relationships between individual serum carotenoid concentrations and total carotenoids and the prevalence of the MetS after adjusting for potential confounders (P for trend < 0·001). The OR of the MetS for the highest (v. lowest) quartile were 0·31 (95 % CI 0·20, 0·47) for α-carotene, 0·23 (95 % CI 0·15, 0·36) for β-carotene, 0·44 (95 % CI 0·29, 0·67) for β-cryptoxanthin, 0·39 (95 % CI 0·26, 0·58) for lycopene, 0·28 (95 % CI 0·18, 0·44) for lutein+zeaxanthin and 0·19 (95 % CI 0·12, 0·30) for total carotenoids. Higher concentrations of each individual carotenoid and total carotenoids were significantly associated with a decrease in the number of abnormal MetS components (P for trend < 0·001-0·023). Higher serum carotenoid levels were associated with a lower prevalence of the MetS and fewer abnormal MetS components in middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults.

84916233433	Association of plasma mir-17-92 with dyslipidemia in patients with coronary artery disease	Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have already been proposed as sensitive and informative biomarkers for the diagnosis of multiple diseases. We investigated the miRNA expression patterns in plasma samples of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and explored the potential functions of certain miRNAs. Deep sequencing analysis was performed to determine the miRNA expression profiles using RNA samples isolated from 20 healthy subjects and 20 patients with CAD. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was applied to confirm the differential expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in 81 patients and 50 healthy volunteers. The association between the miR-17-92 cluster and clinical characteristics of patients with CAD were analyzed using SPSS16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL. Hundreds of miRNAs were detected and most members from the miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogs, including miR-18a, miR-92a, miR-106b, and miR-17, exhibited differential expression in the plasma of patients with CAD compared with controls. Moreover, these miRNAs were found widely related to the blood lipids in the patients with CAD, as miR-17 was positively correlated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, while miR- 92a was found positively related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) but negatively related to lipoprotein-a. Additionally, miR- 106b was positively related to HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I. Taken together with existing evidence from mechanistic studies, the current results of our study support a relationship between the miR-17-92 family and lipid metabolism, which merits further study.

84916884438	Taking a low glycemic index multi-nutrient supplement as breakfast improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial	Dietary therapy is the mainstay of treatment for diabetes. This study examined the effect of a low glycemic index (GI) multi-nutrient supplement, consumed in place of breakfast, on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 71 participants were randomized at a 2:1 ratio into either a breakfast replacement group or a normal breakfast group for a 12-week interventional study. The primary outcome measure was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Nutrition status and somatometry were studied as secondary outcomes. The breakfast replacement group displayed a -0.2% absolute reduction in HbA1c (95% CI (confidence interval), -0.38% to -0.07%, p = 0.004), while the HbA1c of the control group increased 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1% to 0.5%, p = 0.005). The baseline Mini Nutritional Assessment score for both groups was 26.0 and no significant changes occurred following intervention. However, there was a statistically significant difference in body mass index between the treatment and control groups (p = 0.032) due to the weight gain in the control group (increased 0.5 kg, 95% CI was 0.2 to 0.9, p = 0.007). These data suggest that breakfast replacement with a low GI multi-nutrient supplement can improve glycemic and weight control in T2DM.

10244266385	Humoral immune responses in rabbits induced by an experimental inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine prepared from F69 strain	Background. The etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been confirmed to be a novel coronavirus (CoV), namely SARS-CoV. Developing safe and effective SARS-CoV vaccines is essential for us to prevent the possible reemergence of its epidemic. Previous experiences indicate that inactivated vaccine is conventional and more hopeful to be successfully developed. Immunogenicity evaluation of an experimental inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in rabbits was conducted and reported in this paper. Methods. The large-scale cultured SARS-CoV F69 strain was inactivated with 0. 4% formaldehyde and purified, then used as the immunogen combined with Freund's adjuvant. Eight adult New Zealand rabbits were immunized four times with this experimental inactivated vaccine. Twelve sets of rabbit serum were sampled from the third day to the seventy-fourth day after the first vaccination. The titers of specific anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody were determined by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the neutralizing antibody titers were detected with micro-cytopathic effect neutralization test. Results. Rapid and potent humoral immune responses were induced by the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine in all the eight test rabbits. Titers of both specific IgG antibody and neutralizing antibody peaked at about six weeks after first vaccination, with the maximum value of 1:81 920 and 1:20 480, respectively. After that, serum antibody levels remained at a plateau or had a slight decrease, though two boosters were given in the succedent 4 to 5 weeks. Cross neutralization response existed between SARS-CoV F69 strain and Z2-Y3 strain. Conclusions. The inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine made from F69 strain owns strong immunogenicity, and the cross neutralization response between the two different SARS-CoV strains gives a hint of the similar neutralizing epitopes, which provide stable bases for the development of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines.
