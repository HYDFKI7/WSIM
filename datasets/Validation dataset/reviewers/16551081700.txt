84866671478	PID control of non-square systems and its application in the fuel cell voltage	This paper studies PID control for non-square systems. A non-square system has unequal numbers of inputs and outputs and there exists coupling among its PID controllers. The coupling can't be simply eliminated using conventional decoupling methods for square systems, thus it is hard to tune PID controllers for non-square systems. In this paper, we adopt predictive control for non-square systems since predictive control method doesn't assume that the dimensions of inputs and outputs are equal and it is suitable for the control of non-square systems. To implement the final controller in practice, the paper proposes to reduce model predictive control(MPC) into PID control.

Frequency control is usually accomplished through generator governor response (primary frequency regulation) and Load Frequency Control (LFC). The goal of LFC is to reestablish primary frequency regulation capacity, return the frequency to its nominal value and minimize unscheduled tie-line power flows between neighboring control areas. This paper first formulates the LFC problem for single-area power systems as a disturbance rejection problem and discuss the effect of system parameters and the generation rate constraints (GRC) on the control performance. Then decentralized LFC for multi-area power systems is formulated and a result on checking the stability of the closed-loop system considering the inherent structure of the multi-area power systems is proposed.

80053070532	Load frequency control for wind-diesel hybrid systems	A wind-diesel hybrid power system is a feasible and economic method to supply power for remote areas. To maintain a sustainable and dependable power supply, the frequency of the system must be kept a constant. This paper adopts a two-degree-of-freedom internal model control (IMC) method to study the load frequency control problem for a wind-diesel hybrid power system. The method needs only to tune two parameters and is effective in rejecting disturbance. Due to the high-order transfer function of the system model, a PID reduction method is proposed to reduce the high-order IMC controller for easy implementation of the control system in practice. The design and simulation results show that the load frequency controller at the diesel generator can regulate the system frequency quickly, while the pitch controller at the wind turbine can attenuate the effect of the wind uncertainties on system frequency. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

80053086036	Disturbance rejection in thermal power plants	A typical thermal power plant is characterized by nonlinearity, changing parameters, unknown disturbances, large time-delays, large inertia and highly coupled dynamics among various control loops, making it one of the most challenging industrial control problems beyond scope of existing theories. Currently proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, an eighty-year-old technology, is still the predominant tool of choice in power plant control. Given the potential economic payoff, better solutions to power plant control are highly desired. An alternative framework is proposed in this paper to study the control problem in thermal power plants in which disturbance rejection is the central theme. As a result, control problems are better understood as well as the means of solving them. This new formulation of existing problems is followed by a systematic review of disturbance rejection methods that ultimately leads us to the concept of Active Disturbance Rejection. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

80955172192	Unit commitment for power plants with tracking speed limits	Unit commitment is an efficient method to lower the total cost of the power plant by scheduling units' generation and meeting the constraint condition. However, in practice, few power plants implement the algorithm for fear that the load response in the power plant would not be fast enough to track the unscheduled load demand from the power grid if some units of the power plant are shut down. This paper proposes a new unit commitment method that tries to solve this problem effectively. The proposed method guarantees the desired speed limit by setting the plant-level load tracking speed. In this method a one-at-a-time unit commitment is accomplished. The most expensive unit (which is determined by computing its cost) is optimized, the unit commitment schedule is updated, and the load dispatch result is re-computed. The result will be repeatedly optimized until the spinning reserve or load tracking speed is lack. The optimization loop will breaks out as well if the unit schedules of two consecutive iterations over the time period remain unchanged. The test results from 10-machine system shows that the proposed method is easy to understand and quick to solve, and is of practical use. © 2011 IEEE.

A decentralized PID tuning method is proposed by assuming that the tie-line power flows are disconnected. The general transfer function model of LFC for decentralized control design of deregulated power systems is derived first, and then an IMC-PID method is used to design the local load frequency controllers. A method to analyze the stability of the decentralized LFC for conventional environments is also extended to the deregulated case. The proposed method is tested on a four-area power system under various operating conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed design method is simple to follow, can achieve good performance, and results in implementable PID controllers. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84863735457	Robust analysis of decentralized load frequency control for multi-area power systems	Robust analysis for decentralized load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems is studied in this paper. It is observed that such an analysis can be decomposed into two steps considering the inherent structure of a multi-area power system: robustness analysis against the parametric variations in local-area power systems and robustness analysis against the structure and/or magnitude variations in the tie-line power flow network. A detailed structured singular value method is proposed for local-area robustness analysis, and an eigenvalue method is derived for tie-line robustness analysis. The proposed method is then applied to a four-area power system and the results show that the method is convenient and useful for decentralized load frequency control of multi-area power systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

0037374942	IMC design for unstable processes with time delays	A modified IMC structure is proposed for unstable processes with time delays. The structure extends the standard IMC structure for stable processes to unstable processes and controllers do not have to be converted to conventional ones for implementation. An advantage of the structure is that setpoint tracking and disturbance rejection can be designed separately. A method is proposed to tune the modified IMC structure with an emphasis on the robustness of the structure. Design for some typical delayed unstable processes shows that the control structure can be tuned easily and achieve good tradeoff between time-domain performance and robustness. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

84867673644	An improved dual particle swarm optimization algorithm for unit commitment problem	To solve the unit commitment problem economically and quickly, an improved dual particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm including both discrete and continuous parts was proposed. The starting and shutdown state of units were optimized according to different period of time using discrete PSO, and a pair of critical operators was added into the algorithm; in addition, the criterion condition of feasible solution was modified, where the sum of each unit's lowest value must be smaller than the load to some extent. The inheritance from earlier state and constraints to later period of time for running time and shutdown time were considered. The continuous PSO was used in units' load dispatch during the process of deciding starting-stopping states and after the solution, where constraints of power balance, spinning reserve and lower and upper limits were considered. While solving the economic load dispatch, penalty function was adopted to satisfy the ramp rate constraints, and the minimum coal consumptions could be gained. Two examples including 24 period of time were simulated, the experimental results of which showed the proposed approach decreased amount of effort during search and improved convergence rate. In addition, the new method suggests new thinking for unit commitment problem. © 2012 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.

84872007510	Partially decentralized controller design via model predictive control	An expansion procedure to design partially decentralized controllers via model predictive control is proposed in this paper. Partially decentralized control is a control structure that lies between a fully decentralized structure and a fully centralized one, and has the advantage of achieving comparable performance as a fully centralized controller but with simpler structure. The proposed method follows the expansion method proposed in a previous paper where internal model control (IMC) was used to design controllers for non-square subsystems. The method requires computing the pseudo-inverse of a non-square matrix via pseudo-inverse factors. Instead, the proposed method uses dynamic matrix control (DMC) to design PID controllers for non-square subsystems without using additional factors. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on several chemical examples. Simulation results show that the proposed method is simple and can achieve better performance. © 2012 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).

It is difficult to build an accurate mathematical model. So using conventional controllers cannot achieve the desired performance. Through analysis of the control structure of the CFB combustion system, this paper presents a two-degree-of-freedom PID controller based desired dynamic equation (DDE) method and a partially decentralized PID controller based on dynamic matrix control (DMC) for the CFB combustion system. Both methods do not depend on the accurate mathematical model and can improve the control performance of systems with large time delays.

84882772226	Partially decentralized control for a quadruple tank process	Partially decentralized control for a quadruple tank process is studied in this paper. A quadratic tank is a multivariable, nonlinear process with time delay and strong coupling. Considering that a decentralized control will not achieve the desired performance, and that a centralized multivariable control is usually complex and difficult to implement, this paper designs a partially decentralized controller for a quadratic tank. Partially decentralized control is a structure that lies between the fully decentralized control and the centralized control.

84882785352	Load frequency control for power systems via DMC	Load frequency control (LFC) is an important technique in providing good power quality and maintaining safety, reliability and economics of power systems. This paper proposes a PID controller design method via dynamic matrix control (DMC), and applies it to the load frequency control problems. DMC does not need a detailed mathematical model of the controlled plant, and the controller design can be done using the step response of the system, which is simple and can achieve good performance. However, receding horizon DMC needs certain burden of computation and is not easy to implement in a conventional distributed control system (DCS). So this paper approximates DMC to a PID controller utilizing its closed-loop form. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve good performance compared with the traditional PID method, with better load disturbance rejection and robustness. © 2013 IEEE.

84890461694	Linear active disturbance rejection controllers (LADRC) for boiler-turbine units	Linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) is shown to be a simple and effective method as a substitute of conventional PID control. Nevertheless, the tuning of the LADRC parameters needs some experience, especially for multivariable systems. Boiler-turbine units are widely used in power generation industry, and are typical multivariable systems with strong coupling, nonlinearity, large time delay and large inertia. In this paper, an LADRC scheme is proposed for boiler-turbine units which compromises a decoupling compensator and two SISO linear active disturbance rejection controllers. The compensator helps reduce the strong coupling between the two outputs and two LADRCs further reduce the external disturbances and model uncertainties. Since LADRC can estimate the disturbances via extended state observer (ESO), it will eliminate the disturbance quickly independent of the accurate mathematical model of the units. Simulation results show that the LADRC structure for boiler-turbine units can achieve good decoupling and good disturbance rejection with robustness, and it is easy to tune and implement in practice. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.

84894523555	Linear active disturbance rejection control for load frequency control of power systems	We apply the linear active disturbance rejection approach (LADRC) to the load-frequency control (LFC) of power systems. Considering the model and the structure of the controlled system, we analyze a second order and a third order LADRCs for a single-area power system with non-reheated turbine; and reveal the limitations of the 2nd-order LADRC. To deal with the generation rate constraint (GRC) of the system, we propose an anti-GRC scheme for LADRC, where the error between the computed output and the real output of the turbine is fed back to the extended state observer for fast compensation of the windup. Finally, the LADRC is extended to power systems with reheated and hydro-turbines, and multi-area power systems. It is found that LADRC is a model-free control method with only two tuning parameters. Thus, it is very practical in industrial control. Simulation examples show that LADRC can reduce the load disturbance very well and is readily applicable to the load-frequency control system.

We suppose that the state information of every subsystem is split into different packets and only one packet of the subsystem can be transmitted at a time. Multiple NCSs with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties and multiple transmissions are modeled as a periodic switched system in this paper. State feedback controllers can be constructed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to show that a collection of uncertain NCSs with the problem of limited communication can be effectively stabilized via the designed controller. © 2014 Mei Yu et al.

The connections between one area and the rest of the system and the effects of possible contracts are treated as a set of new disturbances besides the system load. LADRC uses an extended state observer (ESO) to estimate the disturbances and compensates them quickly. Thus it can achieve good disturbance rejection performance and is a good candidate for LFC design. The proposed method is tested on two power systems. Simulation results show that the LADRC is simple to tune for load frequency control systems, and good performance can be achieved.

84924764550	Anti-windup schemes for linear active disturbance rejection control	Control input constraints are very common in industrial process, however, conventional controller design methods usually assume that the actuator dynamics is linear. Therefore, when there are constraints in the actuator, the output signal of the actuator is not consistent with the output signal of the controller, which leads to reduced control performance, even system instability. Two anti-windup schemes are proposed in this paper for linear active disturbance rejection controller (LADRC) when there are constraints in the actuator. The schemes utilize the extended state observer (ESO) to estimate the states of the controller or the error between the controller output and actuator output, so LADRC can eliminate the error quickly. Simulation study is carried out for a first order plus dead time process with actuator constraints. The results show that both schemes can achieve good anti-windup performance. Then the idea is extended to the load frequency control (LFC) system using LADRC. Simulation shows that the error-compensation-based anti-windup scheme is more effective in LFC.
