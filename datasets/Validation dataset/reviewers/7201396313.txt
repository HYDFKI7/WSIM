84930478001	The role of smoking status and collagen IX polymorphisms in the susceptibility to cervical spondylotic myelopathy	We investigated a possible association of collagen IX tryptophan (Trp) alleles (Trp2 and Trp3) and smoking with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) in 172 Chinese patients and 176 age- and gender-matched controls. The smoking status was evaluated by smoking index (SI). The CSM cases had a significantly higher prevalence of Trp2 alleles (Trp2+) than controls (19.8 vs 6.2%, P = 0.002), but the prevalence of Trp3 alleles (Trp3+) was similar between the two groups (23.3 vs 21.6%, P = 0.713). Logistic regression analyses showed that the subjects with Trp2+ had a higher risk for CSM. We thus analyzed whether smoking status influenced the association between Trp2 alleles and CSM risk. Among Trp2+ subjects with an SI less than 100, the smoking status did not influence the effect of risk for SCM [odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidential interval (95%CI) = 0.85-2.18, P > 0.05]. When SI increased from 101 to 300, the OR for CSM reached 3.34 (95%CI = 2.11-5.67, P = 0.011); when SI was more than 300, the OR for CSM reached 5.56 (95%CI = 3.62-7.36, P < 0.001). Among Trp2-subjects with SI more than 300, the OR for CSM increased 2.14 (95%CI = 1.15-4.07, P = 0.024). We found a significant association between the Trp2 alleles and CSM risk and smoking amplifies this risk, suggesting that smoking abstinence is important for reducing CSM occurrence in subjects with high genetic risk. © FUNPEC-RP.

84940328322	Rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transfected with recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying basic fibroblast growth factor: Variation of cell phenotypes	Background: Exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays an important role in the ligament tissue healing process, and the use of transgenic methods to transfect exogenous genes into cells can promote the secretion of bFGF. Objective: To observe phenotypic changes and the bFGF protein expression after bFGF recombinant adenovirus was used to transfect rabbit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Methods: Passage 2 BMSCs were divided into three groups: Ad. bFGF-eGFP group, Ad. eGFP group and control group. Under a phase contrast microscope we observed the changes in cell morphology. The expression of bFGF protein in BMSCs was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The proliferative curve was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Results And Conclusion: The transfected cells showed a uniform phenotype of fibroblasts. MTT colorimetric assay revealed that more proliferative activity of transfected BMSCs was shown in the Ad. bFGF-eGFP group than in the Ad. eGFP group and control group. ELISA results showed that expression of bFGF protein was higher in the Ad. bFGF-eGFP group than in the Ad. eGFP group and control group (P < 0. 05). BFGF recombinant adenovirus can induce the differentiation of BMSCs into fibroblasts, increase proliferative ability and promote the expression of bFGF protein.

20544468960	Biocompatibility of swelling polyethylene compound biomembrane for preventing peridural adhesion	Aim: To evaluate the in vitro biocompatibility of swelling polyethylene compound biomembrane, a self-made absorbable adhesive material in medicine for the prevention of epidural adhesion. Methods: The experiment was completed in the laboratory for Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from March 2003 to August 2003. The cytotoxicity test, hemolytic test and acute whole body intoxication toxicity test were performed with standard method. Results: 1 The fibroblasts of L-929 mice were in good morphology and proliferation after treated with swelling polyethylene compound biomembrance extract solution. At 2, 4 and 7 days, the absorbance (A) values were 0.552 ± 0.044, 0.783 ± 0.040 and 1.198 ± 0.052 respectively in polyethylene compound group, significantly different from those in the positive control group(0.347 ± 0.025, 0.446 ± 0.018 and 0.565 ± 0.025 respectively) (t = 26.47 to 31.12, P < 0.01). The relative proliferation rate was higher than 100%, and the toxicity gradation of the material was 0. 2 The hemolysis rate was 2.21% (< 5%), which was in accordance with the standard of hemolytic test. 3 No acute whole body intoxication reaction was found. The body mass of the animals were increased by (1.77 ± 0.42), (2.57 ± 0.39) and (3.30 ± 0.43) g respectively in polyethylene compound group at 24, 48 and 72 hours, and by(-2.79 ± 0.23), (-3.83 ± 0.35) and(-3.89 ± 0.34) g in positive control group, so there were significant difference between the two groups(t = 58.34 to 87.12, P < 0.01).

0029783314	Role de l'asymetrie facettaire dans la pathologie de la colonne lombaire	The correlation between facet joint asymmetry and disorders of the lumbar spine was analyzed in a study of plain radiographs, computed tomograms and magnetic resonance images from 76 normal subjects and 173 patients who underwent lumbar surgery. Of 76 normal controls who were studied by means of plain radiographs, only 21 (27.6%) had facet asymmetry at the level of 1,4-5 or L5-S1, while 84 (48.6%) of 173 patients who were studied with plain radiographs, and partially with CT or MRI, were noted to have facet asymmetry. The difference was highly significant (P < 0.01). This study supports the etiologic significance of facet asymmetry in lumbar disorders.

0029805252	Lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis	Lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disc herniation are usually regarded as two pathogenetically different conditions, but in the literature lumbar disc herniation in patients with developmental spinal stenosis has been rarely documented. In a clinical retrospective study, 42 lumbar disc herniations with developmental spinal stenosis were reported and analyzed. Discectomy was performed after laminotomy. The patients were followed-up for an average of 4.4 years (range 2-7 years). The preoperative symptoms disappeared completely in 28 patients, in 13 patients some degree of backache remained although their nerve root pain had been relieved, and in 1 patient intermittent claudication reappeared after 6 years resolution of their preoperative pain. We conclude that when developmental spinal stenosis is combined with disc herniation, discectomy through laminotomy rather than laminectomy is usually sufficient for decompression.

0030264569	Multiple non-contiguous injuries of the spine	Forty-seven patients with multiple non-contiguous injuries of the spine were reviewed retrospectively, giving an incidence of 5.4 per cent of 875 spinal injuries. Thirty-three were men and 14 women with an age range of between 16 and 78 years. Twenty-three were treated operatively. The multiple non-contiguous injuries had a more complicated mechanism of injury and tended to be more severe injuries than single-level injuries as they were combined more frequently with injuries of other parts of the body. Being aware of this combination of injuries lends to an earlier diagnosis. Operative reconstruction is recommended.

0031439240	Acute central cervical cord injury presenting with only upper extremity involvement	Twenty-four patients with acute central cervical cord injury with minor and sensory impairment involving only the upper extremities are described; none had any abnormality in the lower extremities. They were all treated conservatively with one exception in whom an anterior decompression was performed. Seventeen had complete recovery of motor function; the remaining 7 had some weakness of the palmar interosseous muscles. The time to recovery was from 2 weeks to 4 months. Sensory recovery took from 4 to 6 months after injury. This type of injury is caused by damage to the anterior and posterior horn cells in the cervical cord.

0031974539	Solitary bone cyst in the odontoid process and body of the axis	A four-year-old boy presented with a solitary bone cyst in the odontoid process and body of the axis. Plain radiographs showed a radiolucent lesion with extreme thinning of the cortex and MRI demonstrated a high signal intensity in the interlesional matrix. The cystic component extended into the body of the axis through a defect in the epiphyseal plate. At operation, the cavity of the cyst was found to contain serosanguineous fluid, and histological examination showed that it was lined by a thin layer of connective tissue. The cyst may have originated from a defect in the epiphyseal plate.

0032035351	Diagnosis and treatment of acute central cervical cord injury	Objective To clarify the diagnosis and management of acute central cervical cord injury. Methods Eighty-nine patients with acute cervical central cord injury were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-three patients were treated conservatively and 26 were treated surgically. There were two acute deaths. Eighty-seven patients were followed up for 3 months to 15 years. Results Their average neurological score (ASIA) was increased from 41.7 at admission to 83.1 at follow-up. Conclusions Acute central cervical cord injury should be differentiated from complete spinal cord injury, cervical myelopathy, cruciate paralysis and C8 nerve root injury. When compression of nerve tissue or cervical instability is identified, operative intervention should be indicated. The prognosis is less optimistic in the patients with severe primary injury and at old age.

0031663535	Radiculopathy after laminectomy for cervical compression myelopathy	Postoperative radiculopathy is a complication of posterior cervical decompression associated with tethering of the nerve root. We reviewed retrospectively 287 consecutive patients with cervical compression myelopathy who had been treated by multilevel cervical laminectomy and identified 37 (12.9%) with postoperative radiculopathy. There were 27 men and ten women with a mean age of 56 years at the time of operation. The diagnosis was either cervical spondylosis (25 patients) or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (12 patients). Radiculopathy was observed from four hours to six days after surgery. The most frequent pattern of paralysis was involvement of the C5 and C6 roots of the motor-dominant type. The mean time for recovery was 5.4 months (two weeks to three years). The results at follow-up showed that the rate of motor recovery was negatively related to the duration of complete recovery of postoperative radiculopathy (γ = -0.832, p < 0.01) and that patients with spondylotic myelopathy had a significantly better rate of clinical recovery than those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (t = 2.960, p < 0.01). Postoperative radiculopathy may be prevented by carrying out an anterior decompression in conjunction with spinal fusion, which will achieve stabilisation and directly remove compression of the cord at multiple levels.

2442555052	Establishment of an animal model of cauda equina syndrome and its formative mechanism	Aim: To establish an animal model of cauda equina syndrome simulate the actual clinical condition to study pathology of cauda equina syndrome. Methods: Eighty normal adult male New Zealand rabbits were divided into control group, model 1 and 2 groups with compression injury in the cauda equina and spinal nerve root (groups A and B). Nerve compression was applied to the dural matter and the nerve roots after partial laminectomy in the vertebral canal (1/9, 2/9, 1/2). The specimens were sampled at different time points after the compression for pathological and immunohistochemical study with the nerve functions assessed. Results: Significant neurological changes were observed with 75% restriction of the cauda equina, sacral nerve function grade 1/2 d after the compression in comparison with other time points (P < 0.05). Neural tissue damage included inflammatory response in the cauda equina, and axonal and wallerian degeneration followed by Schwann cell proliferation, axonal bud regeneration and necrosis of the poeudounipolar neurons in the nerve root ganglion. Apoptosis of the anterior horn cells occurred in the conus medullaris. Conclusion: Acute nerve compression can lead to cauda equina sydrome due to cauda equina neural tissue damage, which is most severe 1/2 day after the compression injury.

2442560220	Change of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant gene expression after spinal cord injury in rats	Aim: To study the changes of expression of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC-1) in rats after spinal cord injury. Methods: Forty-two SD rats were divided randomly into seven groups. The modified Allen's model of spinal cord injury was established. The expression of CINC-1mRNA after spinal cord injury was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The expression of CINC-1mRNA was seen in uninjured spinal cord tissue and was significantly increased at 1 h post-injury, peaked at 6 h (1.027 ± 0.124), which was significantly different from that in the sham group operation group (0.175 ± 0.095) (t = 13.359, P < 0.01), and remained significantly higher than the normal at 72 h post-injury. Conclusion: The rapidly increased expression of CINC-1mRNC indicates that CINC-1 play a negative role in the secondary spinal cord injury.

27644536002	Osteogenetic activity of rabbit bone marrow stromal cells combined with beta-tricalcium phosphate cultured in vitro	Aim: To investigate the ability of rabbit bone marrow stromal cells differentiating to osteoblasts and the osteogenetic activity of the bone marrow stromal cells/β-tricalcium phosphate composites. Methods: The experiment was completed in the Orthopaedics Laboratory of Changzhen Hospital, the Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from October 2003 to February 2004. Bone marrow stroma cells obtained from seven adult New Zealand rabbits were collected from the bone marrow and cultured in DMEM culture medium, including desamethasone, β-glycerophosphate and vitamin C. The development configuration and biological characteristics of cells were examined by invert microscope, transmission electron microscope, Alkaline phosphatase stain and type I collagen stain. The bone marrow stromal cells/β-tricalcium phosphate composites cultured in vitro for one week and then were implanted back to self-intramuscular. After 4 and 8 weeks, the materials were taken out to do the histological examination so as to evaluate the osteogenesis of tissue bone. Results: All 7 rabbits entered the final analysis. 1 Growth and morphological characters of cells: 24-48 hours after culture with whole bone marrow method, cells began to adhere to cell wall and showed short spindle shape. The adhered cells grew as the type of fibroblast. Frve to seven days after culture, cell colony growth was more and more intensive, cellular volume largened gradually and changed into long spindle shape, and part cells showed a polygonal shape. 2 Curves of cell growth: At the third generation, cell proliferation was slow from one to three days, so this period was called latent period. Cells were enlarged greatly after 3-5 days and increased to the top after 6 days. The curves of cell growth in the first, second and fourth generations were similar to that in the third one. 3 Adherent rate of cells: There were no obviously different in each generation. Generally, adherence began in the first 2 hours, and speeded up from 2 to 8 hours. The adherent rate reached 80%-90% from 8 to 14 hours. 4 Index of cell division: In the earlier stage, cell division was slow, and then reached the maximal rate (10%-15%) 5-8 days after culture. Nucleus was largened gradually, and double nucleus were increased. The rate of karyokinesis was similar in those four generations. 5 Results of cellular ultrastructure: At the second generation, massive collagen was seen in the bone marrow stroma cells under the transmission electron microscope. 6 Assay results of serum Alkaline phosphatase: After bone marrow stroma cells staining, serum Alkaline phosphatase showed red-brown deposit, especially in the intensive region of cells. The positive rate of serum Alkaline phosphatase stain in the third generation was 85% or above. 7 Assay results of immunohistochemical type I collagen: Immunohistochemical stain of type I collagen in each generation was positive, and the cytoplasm was red. 8 Observation of intramuscular osteoblasts activity: Newborn bone stroma was seen 4 weeks after the compound of bone marrow stroma cells/β-tricalcium phosphate implanted into body. Newborn bones were increased obviously 8 weeks later, and typical bone tissue was observed. However, massive fiber connective tissue was observed in artificial bone aperture of non-compound cells, and bone tissue was not observed on the fourth week and the tenth week culture in vivo. Conclusion: The morphological characteristics and functions of cultured bone marrow stroma cells in vitro are similar to those of osteoblasts. Massive cells with the osteoblasts ability can be obtained in a short term. Compound β-tricalcium phosphate is a great carrier for bone cell, in addition, heterotopic osteoblasts appear after the existence of bone cells/β tricalcium phosphate carrier. This provides a themry and paramete for clinical bone tissue engineering.

27644595470	Gene expression of type I and type II collagen in human lumbar ligamentum flavum along with age verifying cartilaginous ossification specifically and objectively	Aim: To observe the distribution, intensity and changes with age of gene expression of type I and II collagen of human lumbar ligamentum flavum of patients at different age by using the specific probe and verify the increase-with-age hypothesis of degeneration and ossification of ligamentum flavum by objective image analysis. Methods: The study was completed in the central laboratory of Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University from August 2003 to August 2004. Twenty-one ligamentum flava were separated from the patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) or with spinal stenosis following vertebral posterior decompression of vertebral lamina. The control specimens were separated from 4 young patients with lumbar spine fracture also following posterior decompression of vertebral lamina. The specimens were all supplied by voluntary patients. The ligamentum flavum specimens from patients with LDH or spinal stenosis were divided into 4 groups based on their age: under 20 years group, 20 to 40 years group, 41 to 60 years group and over 60 years group. Type I and II collagen probes were labeled to perform in situ hybridization and image analysis of frozen sections of ligamentum flavum specimens in the above groups followed by the observation of the expression of type I collagen (gene phenotypes of fibroblasts) and type II collagen (gene phenotypes of chondrocytes). Results: 1 Observation on tissue sections by in situ hybridizatio: In the under 20 years group, fibrocytes in the insertion site and body of ligamentum flavum arranged orderly, most of which were fusiform, and expression type I collagen expressed was obvious, but there was no expression of type II collagen. In the 20 to 40 years group, most cells in the ligamentum flavum arranged orderly, but the number of which were decreased relatively, slight fibrosis was found, and a few expression signals of type I and II collagen were observed on the insertion sites of ligamentum flavum. In the 41 to 60 years group, the cells in the body of ligamentum flavum arranged disorderly, the number of which decreased relatively, obvious fibrosis was found; No positive expression was found in body of ligamentum flavum, but weakly positive expression of type I collagen was found in insertion site of ligamentum flavum, and the positive cells distributed unevenly; The expression of type II collagen was higher than that in the groups under 41 years. In the above 60 years group, fibrosis was found in ligamentum flavum, but no expression signal of type I collagen, and the expression signal of type II collagen was enhanced in the insertion site of ligamentum flavum. 2 The expression of type I collagen in the groups under 20 years, from 20 to 40 year, from 41 to 60 years, and over 60 years (1.53 ± 0.18, 1.34 ± 0.16, 0.86 ± 0.13, 0.71 ± 0.21 respectively) were significantly higher than that in the control group (0.51 ± 0.11) (P < 0.1), and it was decreased with age (P < 0.05), but it was insignificantly different between the groups from 41 to 60 years and over 60 years. The expission of type II collagen was also higher in the above four groups of age than in the control group (0.73 ± 0.16, 1.14 ± 0.14, 1.46 ± 0.13, 1.65 ± 0.16 vs 0.53 ± 0.12, P < 0.01 ), and it was increased with age (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The type I and II collagen cDNA probes are of high specificity. Along with the increasing age, the expression of type I collagen is suppressed gradually, but the expression of type II collagen is enhanced, indicating that the gene expression of fibroblasts is weakened gradually, and the expression of chondrocytes is activated gradually, so it provides molecular biological basis for the degeneration and ossification of ligamentum flavum.

Two 1-week-old SD rats and 12 adult male SD rats of 205-300 g were used. The adult rats were divided into control group (n=6) and experimental group (n=6). 1 The cDNA encoding the glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) was isolated by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with total RNA extracted from fetal rat brain. 2 GGF2 cDNA was cloned into eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP N1 of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reported gene encoding green fluorescence protein in the form of fused protein. The expression vector of recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-GGF2 was successfully constructed. 3 The recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-GGF2 and transfectam liposome complexes were injected into adult rats thoracic spinal cord, and the rats in the control group were only injected with the mixture of liposomes and blank plasmid pEGFP-N1. One week after injection, 3 rats in each group were anesthetized to remove materials for RT-PCR, and the other 3 were anesthetized to remove T8 and T9 spinal cords, and then fluorescent photography was conducted, and the expression of green fluorescent protein was observed. Results: All the 12 rats were involved in the analysis of results. 1 Results of GGF2 cDNA clone: GGF2 cDNA were successfully cloned. 2 Results of recombinant plasmid pEGFP-N1-GGF2: The analysis by restricting enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing showed that GGF2 cDNA fragment was cloned into pEGFP-N1. 3 The expression of GGF2 mRNA confirmed by RT-PCR: The expression of GGF2 mRNA in local spinal cord at 1 week after gene transfection was significantly increased in the experimental group. 4 Results of pEGFP-N1-GGF2 gene transfection in vivo: The expression of EGFP was observed in the cells of gray matter and white matter around the injected locus by fluorescence microscope in the experimental group, but no expression of fluorescent protein was observed in the control group. Conclusion: Cationic liposome mediated g ene delivery can be a practical method for gene transfer in spinal cord, and EGFP can serve as reported gene to help the observation of the expression of GGF2 protein after gene transfer in vivo.

Methods: From February 1993 to September 2002, 44 patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis, who were treated in the orthopaedic departments of the 89 Hospital of Chinese PLA and Changzheng Hospital of the Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA, participated in the study voluntarily. They all had a bilateral defect of the pars interarticularis with vertebral slippage, including 26 cases received posterolateral arthrodesis and 18 cases received posteriorly circumferential spinal fusion. They were followed up for 2 years for evaluation of the effect: 1 standards of the evaluation: excellent was the complete disappearance of the pain in waist and lower limbs, and able to squat; good was the disappearance of most pain in waist and lower limbs, and able to squat; moderate was the disappearance of part pain, frequent use of antalgica, and restricted range of squatting; bad was unameliorated or aggravated pain, regular use of antalgica, and unable to squat without support. 2 The fused condition of the grafted bone was assessed according to the radiography and CT results. Results: According to intention-to-treat analysis, all the 44 patients were involved in the analysis of results. 1 The clinical effect in the patients treated with posterolateral arthrodesis and posteriorly 360° fusion: It was excellent in 5 cases, good in 36 cases, moderate in 2 cases and bad in 1 case respectively, and the rate of excellent and good was 93.2% (41/44). 2 The fused condition of the grafted bone: One case with bad prognosis had failed fusion, another 1 case still had isthmic abnormal activity when the internal fixation was taken out, the other 42 cases had bone fusion, and the fusion rate was 95.4% (42/44). 3 Adverse events and side effects: Seven cases suffered from postoperative chronic pain in the sites where bone was taken out, and turned better after treatments. Conclusion: The results indicated that autogenous posterolateral arthrodesis or posteriorly circumferential (360 degree) spinal fusion combined with posterior instrumentation led to the satisfactory rates of slippage correction and grafted bone fusion in patients with isthmic spondylolisthesis, could better relieve the symptom of pain in waist and lower limbs, and recover the functional activities of squatting.

33846799425	Biomechanical study of a hat type cervical intervertebral fusion cage	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical effect of a hat type cervical intervertebral fusion cage (HCIFC). In this in vitro biomechanical study, 48 goat cervical spines (C2-5) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending with a nondestructive stiffness method using a nonconstrained testing apparatus, and three-dimensional displacement was measured. Autologous iliac bone and cervical spine intervertebral fusion cage were implanted according to manufacturers' information after complete discectomy (C3-4). Eight spines in each of the following groups were tested: intact, autologous iliac bone graft, Harms cage, SynCage C, carbon cage, and HCIFC. The mean apparent stiffness values were calculated from the corresponding load-displacement curves. Additionally, cage volume and volume-related stiffness were determined. The stiffness of the SynCage C was statistically greatest in all directions. After implantation of the HCIFC, flexion stiffness increased compared with that of the intact motion segment. There was no significant difference in stiffness between the HCIFC and carbon cage. The stiffness of the HCIFC was statistically higher than that of the Harms cage in axial rotation and significantly lower in flexion, extension, and lateral bending. Volume-related stiffness of all cages was higher than that of iliac bone graft. The Harms cage was highest in volume-related stiffness in all directions. The HCIFC can provide enough primary stability for cervical intervertebral fusion. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

34447290189	Decompression therapy for fore-foot compartment syndromes after fractures and fracture-dislocations of the tarsometatarsal joint: Evaluation on the rehabilitation of shape and feeling of food arch and the motor function	Aim: To evaluate the therapeutic effect of decompression on fore-foot compartment syndromes after fractures and fracture-dislocations of the tarsometatarsal joint as well as the rehabilitation of fore-foot feeling and motor function. Methods: Seventeen patients with fracture-dislocation of tarsometatarsal joint accompanied by fore-foot compartment syndromes were selected from the Department of Orthopedics, Changzheng Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA between May 1996 and April 2003. The compartment pressure of fore-foot was measured with the whiteside equipment with the interstitial pressure > 3.99 kPa, and all patients were treated by decompression of fasciotomy through a dorsal fore-foot incision, and reposition and internal fixation were performed at the same time to reconstruct the arches of foot. The rehabilitation treatment was performed in at 48 hours after the fixation, so as to initiatively and passively exercise all joints in the fore-foot as well as conduct the short-wave infrared therapy. Results: First follow-up was conducted at one month after the operation, which was conducted once every three months in the first two years, and once every 6 months after the second years. All of the 17 patients were followed up at a mean period of 3.5 years. The evaluation was conducted in the follow-up at 6 months after the operation. The feet of 11 patients were normal in shape with normal motion range, and there was no complaint in loading walk, and they were normal in the X ray inspection. Four patients were slightly limited in motion without influences on walking and working, while proper sports activities could be done, and the X-ray showed a displace of tarsometatarsal joint less than 2 mm. Another 4 patients had occasional fore-feet pain after walking or standing for a long time, and the fore-feet width was increased and the arch of feet was decreased in 3 patients, and two of them suffered from deceased pin-stick sensation and two-point discrimination. None of the cases got stiffness of the fore-foot associated with claw toes, soft-tissue contracture and motor deficit. Conclusion: It is effective to treat the compartment syndromes of the fore-foot after fractures and fracture-dislocations of the tarsometatarsal joint by decompression. The post-operational rehabilitation training as well as soft-wave infrared therapy should be conducted in time, which are helpful to the reconstruction of fore-foot feeling as well as motor function.

Methods: ALT and AST activities in seruni of 30 hSCI rats at acute and recovery stage, as well as those of 10 rats in controlled group, were statistically analyzed respectively. Results: The activities of ALT and AST in serum of acute hSCI rats was (51.01 ± 11.08) and (56.08 ± 20.12) nkat/L respectively, which was obviously higher than those in sham operation group[(36.01 ± 8.79), (30.57 ± 12.98) nkat/L, t = 1.32, 0.56, P < 0.01]. The activities of ALT and AST in serum of hSCI rats at acute stage significantly increased as compared with those at recovery stage [(48.05 ± 18.06), (51.09 ± 11.08) nkat/L]. Conclusion: The activities of ALT and AST at acute stage of hSCI reactively improves, and positively relates to the spinal cord injury severity.

Methods: Eighteen male adult mongrel dogs were evenly randomized into 3 groups: 7 days group, 14 days group and 28 days group. A 5 mm long thick silica tube (diameter 3-4 mm) were implanted under right L6, L7 and S1 nerve root to establish the compression model; the left side served as self controls. Results: Dynamic observation with histopathology and immunohistochemical staining showed that, after the nerve root nerve root compression, the myelinated nerve fibers decreased and there was ultrastructure changes of the nerve fibers, such as Schwann cell cytoplasm swelling and edema, Wallerian degeneration, and demyelinated degeneration of axons. Conclusion: The ultra-structural changes of nerve root are the pathological basis of the function loss of the nerve root. The present model is more closer to the model of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation and stenosis of nerve root compression and it provides a basis for treatment of compression-caused radicular pain and numbness in clinic.

37149002412	Time of early death after cervical spinal cord injury	Objective: To investigate the distribution of time of early death in the patients with cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI). Methods: The clinical data of 63 CECI patients, including demographics, mechanism of injury, cervical spinal cord injury level and severity, associated injury, radiographs, management, and the causes of death, the time from injury to hospitalization and the time from injury to death were retrospectively analyzed so as to detect the time and cause of early death. Results: The 63 CDCI patients died in early stage. 27 of the 63 patients (42.8%) died within a week after CSCI; 43 patients (68.3%) died within two weeks after CSCI, 57 patients (90.5%) died within four weeks after CSCI, and 6 patients (9.5%) died after four weeks after CSCI. Conclusion: The peak time of death is a week after CSCI. The major time of death is two weeks after CSCI. 90.5% cases died within four weeks. Respiratory failure is the leading cause of early death in patients with CSCI.

0034072671	Traumatic disruption of the transverse atlantal ligament	Twenty-three patients with disruption of the transverse atlantal ligament, nine acute and 14 old injuries, were treated over 20 years. All the patients had the neck symptoms and 17 had neurological deficits. Radiographic examinations demonstrated that the atlanto-dental interval (ADI) in these patients was between 6 to 14 mm. Five patients were treated conservatively, and 18 underwent occipitocervical or atlantoaxial fusion. All were followed up for 7 (1 to 17) years. Of five patients treated nonoperatively, four developed an atlantoaxial instability with delayed myelopathy and 1 with an avulsion injury had no complaints. Of 18 patients treated operatively, four recovered completely, seven had some local symptoms, two had their preoperative neurological deficits decreased in severity but five showed no improvement in neurological status. We concluded that early atlantoaxial fusion is indicated for acute traumatic disruption of the transverse ligament when it is predicted to be incapable of healing, but for old injury with unreducible atlantoaxial subluxation occipitocervical fusion is usually performed.

0033831009	Surgical treatment of nonunited fractures of the odontoid process, with special reference to occipitocervical fusion for unreducible atlantoaxial subluxation or instability	Fifty-seven consecutive patients treated surgically for nonunited fractures of the odontoid process were reviewed. All patients presented late, exhibiting neurological deficits subsequent to nonunion. Delay in presentation was between 6 and 120 months (mean 32 months) after the original injury, due to missed diagnosis or inappropriate management. Seven patients who were reduced in traction underwent a Gallie atlantoaxial fusion. In the remaining 50 patients who were unreducible, an occipitocervical arthrodesis was performed. They were followed up for a minimum of 2 years, except one who died from postoperative respiratory failure. All patients obtained a solid bony union, including two in whom nonunion occurred following atlantoaxial fusion, and occipitocervical fusion was added as a rescue. Thirty-eight patients achieved excellent neurological recovery, nine still had some disability, five retained their neurological deficits and two reported a deterioration. In two patients, a recurrence in a traumatic episode was experienced long after a resolution. Our findings demonstrate that occipitocervical arthrodesis is preferable for unreducible subluxation or instability of atlantoaxial articulation in nonunion of odontoid fractures.

0033951313	Central cord injury complicating acute cervical disc herniation in trauma	Study Design. A retrospective study on 24 patients with acute central cervical cord injury caused by traumatic disc herniation. Objectives. To determine the correlation of disc herniation with central cord injury and to evaluate the role of anterior cervical decompression and interbody fusion in management of this injury. Summary of Background Data. Acute cervical disc herniation has been documented as a causative factor in spinal cord injury but has been infrequently reported with central cord syndrome. Methods. Between 1989 and 1994, 24 patients with acute cervical disc herniation and central cord syndrome were studied. These patients underwent anterior decompression and fusion, and were followed for 2 to 7 years, with an average follow-up period of 3 years and 8 months. The degree of disc herniation and neurologic scores were rated. Results. During follow-up period, the American Spinal Injury Association motor score in 24 patients was increased to 86.46 ± 10.22 from 47.79 ± 19.66. The age of the patients was very negatively correlated with recovery rate (P<0.01), but no correlation was observed between severity of cord compression and neurologic scores (P>0.05). Postoperative neurologic improvement in patients with fracture or dislocation was very significantly slower (P<0.01) than in those without these injuries. Conclusions. Far more common than previously expected, acute disc herniation in cervical spine injury is the one of principal cause for central cord syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging assessment and surgical intervention are required.

0033996750	Os odontoideum: Etiology, diagnosis, and management	Background. There have been few reports of os odontoideum since the initial description. Methods. Forty-four patients with os odontoideum treated during the period 1980 through 1996 were reviewed. There were 33 males and 11 females. Their ages ranged from 7 to 56 years, with an average of 24.6 years. Five patients with no symptoms were treated conservatively. Thirty-nine patients underwent operative treatment including nine posterior atlantoaxial fusions and 33 occipitocervical fusions. Results. The patients were followed up for one to 16 years, with an average of 6.5 years. Five patients treated conservatively have remained stable. All 39 treated patients achieved solid arthrodesis. The results were satisfactory. Conclusions. We conclude that fusion is indicated if atlantoaxial instability or clinical symptoms are significant, and that occipitocervical fusion should be considered in the operative management of os odontoideum if atlantoaxial arthrodesis is impossible.

38649142845	Concentration endogenous agmatine in normal and injured spinal cord: Experiment with rats	Objective: To detect the concentration of endogenous agmatine in normal and injured rats' spinal cord. Methods: Forty-two SD rats were randomized to sham-operation group and 1 hour, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours after operation groups. The modified Allen's model of spinal cord injury was established. The endogenous agmatine was detected both in normal and injured rats' spinal cord by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with flurorescence detection and OPA derivatization. Results: The endogenous agmatine level in naive rats' spinal cord were (0.643 ± 0.111) μg/g wet weight. After spinal cord injury, the concentration had a transient drop followed by significantly increase, and then decreased by degrees. Conclusion: Up to now, little has been known about the endogenous agmatine levels in mammalian tissues. The results reported by different authors varied up to hundred times. According to our results and other articles, the endogenous agmatine levels in mammals' central nervous system arranged from 0.2 μg/g to 1.1 μg/g wet weight. Although there was a significant increase after spinal cord injury, the peak concentration was extremely lower than what it needed to take its neuroprotective effect in vitro.

58949091114	Natural killer/T-cell nasal-type lymphoma: Unusual primary spinal tumor	STUDY DESIGN.: A natural killer/T-cell lymphoma originating in the spine of a 60-year-old man is first reported, along with a brief review of the literature on the topic. OBJECTIVE.: To describe the presentation and diagnosis of this disorder along with an emphasis on the importance of this type of rare tumor, needing early and accurate immunophenotypic profiling to make a right diagnosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas represent a rare type of lymphoma derived from either activated NK cell or rarely cytotoxic T cells. It usually originates in the nasal cavity/nasopharynx and invades the surrounding tissues, which is aggressive and, usually, a delay in diagnosis could result in a fatal outcome. METHODS.: A 60-year-old man presented with severe pain in his chest and back for 3 weeks and developed paralysis soon. After we got a negative result of lymphomatous from a bone marrow biopsy, we took a piecemeal excision of the 10th thoracic vertebra. Titanium mesh with bone cement filling-in and mass screw internal fixation system were used for reconstructing the stability of the spine. The histopathology was consistent with NK/T-cell lymphomas. RESULT.: The condition of the patient became worse suddenly after he regained some strength in his both lower limbs a week after the operation. He was not suitable for any aggressive chemotherapy or radiation therapy because of his poor condition and died 20 days later. CONCLUSION.: NK/T-cell lymphomas originated at other sites but nasal cavity/nasopharynx do not present typical clinical features and symptoms in the absence of lymphadenopathy. There are possibilities for misdiagnosis of NK/T-cell lymphoma that originates at other sites. The unfavorable prognosis of this tumor emphasized the need for novel molecular targets and more effective therapies. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

He developed left-sided BSS. Both X-ray film and computed tomography scanning of the thoracic spine showed a right vertebral plate of Th5 fracture and metal fragments inclining through the posterior and left lateral of the spinal canal. Emergency decompressive laminectomy and removal of the foreign metal piece were performed. No improvement in neurological function was observed 10 days after surgery, and thus hyperbaric oxygen treatment was initiated twice a day for the next 1 month.Results:Forty days after surgery, his bladder function returned to normal. The motor deficit had regressed and he could walk without assistance 70 days after the operation. One year later, his lower extremity functions recovered almost completely, except for slight numbness on the right side.Conclusion:As far as we know, on the basis of existing literature, the injury mechanism to BSS by a sharp iron fence point has not been reported so far. The satisfactory recovery after injury may in part be attributed to timely surgery and continuing hyperbaric oxygen treatment. © 2010 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved.

79951969221	The genetic association of Vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and cervical spondylotic myelopathy in Chinese subjects	Background: The association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms to the lumbar degenerative disc disease has been previously studied; however, the role of VDR gene polymorphisms in cervical spondylosis remains unknown. Methods: One hundred fifty four patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and 156 controls were enrolled. The clinical characteristics were collected and the severity of cervical spondylotic myelopathy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The VDR polymorphism genotyping was performed. Results: No significant difference in clinical characteristics was noted between the case and controls. For ApaI polymorphism, the cases had a marked higher prevalence of AA genotype (19.5% vs. 8.3%, P= 0.003) and A allele frequencies (34.4% vs. 22.4%, P<. 0.001) than controls. For TaqI polymorphism, the cases had a significant higher prevalence of TT genotype (67.5vs. 44.2%, P<. 0.001) and T allele frequencies (76.9% vs. 54.2%, P<. 0.001) than controls. The odds ratio for CSM was 2.88 for the ApaI A allele carriers and 4.67 for the TaqI T allele carriers. The TaqI genotypes, both TT and TC showed a markedly higher MRI severity grading level than CC genotype (both P<. 0.01, compared with CC genotype). Conclusion: Certain VDR polymorphism is related in the presence and severity of CSM in Chinese subjects. © 2010.

Back pain was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and time to bone healing, improvement in spondylolisthesis and intervertebral space height at L5/S1 and L4/L5 were assessed.Results:Twenty-one patients were followed up for 24 months and included in the analysis. Back pain was markedly improved at 3 months postoperatively with a statistical difference in VAS scores compared with preoperative VAS scores (P<0.001). The VAS scores were 0 to 3 at 6 months postoperatively in all patients and no back pain was reported in all patients except 2 patients who complained of back pain after prolonged sitting. X-ray examination showed a bone graft healing time of 3 to 12 months. Grade I spondylolisthesis improved to grade 0 in 4 patients and no noticeable change was observed in the remaining 17 cases. The intervertebral space height at L5/S1 was statistically increased (P<0.05) while no statistically significant change was seen at L4/L5. There was no statistically significant difference in the ROM of the intervertebral disks of L5/S1 and L4/5 before and after surgery.Conclusions:The universal pedicle screw-V rod system and isthmic bone grafting directly repairs isthmic spondylolysis and reduces back pain, prevents anterior displacement of the diseased segment and maintains intervertebral space height, thus offering a promising alternative to current approaches for isthmic spondylolysis. © 2013 Chen et al.

84897577637	Assessment of cauda equina syndrome progression pattern to improve diagnosis	STUDY DESIGN.: Meta-analysis of individual patient data. OBJECTIVE.: To date, the progression pattern of cauda equina syndrome (CES) has not been summarized. This study assessed individual patient data from CES cases, investigated the CES progression pattern to help clinicians provide timely diagnoses. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Because there were few randomized controlled trials about CES, our research was based on case reports of CES with detailed medical history. METHODS.: We searched English literature regarding CES in the PubMed database. We included a total of 198 publications involving 264 cases that met the inclusion criteria. The occurrence order of symptoms was determined by reviewing patients' medical histories, and the progression pattern of CES was analyzed using sequential pattern mining. Finally, we summarized and reassessed the current timing of CES diagnosis. RESULTS.: Result of sequential pattern mining demonstrated that the progression process of CES could be divided into 3 stages: early stage of CES (CESE), with bilateral peripheral nerve dysfunction characterized by progressive sensory-motor defects from unilateral to bilateral in lower extremities; incomplete CES, with reduction of sphincter functions; and CES in retention, with sphincter dysfunction. Among all the cases, 81.08% (180 cases) were diagnosed at the stage of incomplete CES or CES in retention, in which 99.4% (179 cases) had experienced CESE without being diagnosed. CONCLUSION.: The characteristic progressive sensory-motor CESE defects in lower extremities marked CES onset. Instead of waiting for the onset of sphincter function abnormalities, CES should be diagnosed when the CESE symptoms manifest. © 2014, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Previous measurements are commonly involved in vertebral plane, but measurements at disc plane are rare. Objective: To compare the difference of measurement of sagittal diameter of the cervical spinal cord at disc versus vertebral planes by MRI. Design, time and setting: Comparative analysis was performed at Changzheng Hospital Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA from March 2006 to April 2007. Participants: 120 volunteers with no cervical spinal diseases were selected from Clinic Outpatient of Changzheng Hospital from March 2006 to April 2007, including 48 males and 72 females, with an average of 41. 4 years (range, 17-71 years). Methods: The cervical MRI of all participants was performed. The sagittal diameters of cervical spinal cord and effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal canal at each segment (disc and vertebral planes) were measured to calculate the ratio of sagittal diameters of cervical spinal cord and effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal canal. Main outcome measures: Sagittal diameters of cervical spinal cord at disc and vertebral planes, effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal canal, and ratio of sagittal diameters of cervical spinal cord and effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal canal. Results: Mean diameters of cervical spinal cord at vertebral plane were significantly larger than those at disc plane (t=2.42, P < 0.01); effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal canal at vertebral plane were significantly larger than those at disc plane (t =2.67, P < 0. 01). However, there were no significantly differences among the ratio of effective sagittal diameters of cervical spinal cord and cervical spinal canal at vertebral plane or at disc plane and the ratio of diameters in total segments (F =0.703, P =0.495). Conclusion: The diameters of cervical spinal cord and cervical spinal canal at disc plane are significantly different from those at vertebral plane, so the measurement at disc plane is necessary. The ratio of diameters of cervical spinal cord and cervical spinal canal can function as an objective radiographic criterion to define and quantify cervical spinal cord disease.

45349102891	Clinical characteristics and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis of upper cervical spine: Analysis of 71 cases	Objective: To study the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the upper cervical spine. Methods: The clinical data of 71 patients with RA in the upper cervical spine, 18 males and 53 females, aged 46.2 (23-76), with a mean duration of RA of 18.2 years (2 months - 47 years) were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-three patients received glucocorticoid for more than 3 months. In addition to routine examinations, all patients underwent plain X-ray film taking, CT and MRI scanning, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor (RF) and antistreptolysin O testing. Results: The symptoms of upper cervical spine appeared at 8.3 years (2 months - 46 years) after the diagnosis of RA was confirmed. The clinical manifestations of RA in the upper cervical spine were intractable pain in craniocervical junction or radiating pain. Abnormal postures in the neck and Sherp-Purser's sign were positive in some patients. Progressive neurological dysfunction with the involvement of spinal cord, medulla, or some cranial nerves might gradually appear. Irregular destruction of bone with osteoporosis around the lateral and median atlantoaxial joint was a common finding in the X-ray films and CT scans. Instability of the atlantoaxial joint, including anterior atlantoaxial subluxation, posterior atlantoaxial subluxation and anterior-posterior atlantoaxial subluxation were found in 68 cases, while rotation subluxation was presented in 37 cases. Vertical migration of the odentoid was seen in 11 cases. RF was positive in 18 cases. MRI revealed that the cause of spinal cord compression was the bone tissue and soft tissue pannus. Conclusions: RA in the upper cervical spine is a common situation in the clinical settings. The key point in the diagnosis of this disease is the identification of instability in the atlantoaxial joint and assessment of the spinal neurological deficit. And a careful analysis of the natural history will further help to achieve a better treatment effect.

47349133210	Surgical decompression and fusion for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis complicated by lumbar instability: Retrospective analysis of 181 cases	Nervous tissue compression and spinal stability are important in treating lumbar spinal stenosis to reduce low back pain or other lumbar instability-caused complications. One hundred and eighty-one cases of lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing surgery in Third People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School and Shanghai Changzheng Hospital between 1997 and 2005 were investigated retrospectively. They consisted of 103 males and 78 females, with an average age of 58.3 years (range, 29-87years) and mean disease course of 45 months (range 5 months to 21 years). The fixation and fusion materials were from Sofamor and Depuy Spine. According to the examination results, 29 cases were treated with complete laminectomy and foraminotomy; 24 treated with hemilaminectomy and foraminotomy; 43 with fenestration and foraminotomy; 52 with decompression and internal fixation and bone graft fusion between transversal process, and 33 with decompression and internal fixation and bone graft fusion between vertebral body. 181 patients were followed up for more than 1 year with a mean follow-up period of 51 months. The satisfactory rate of 5 surgery methods were 75.9%, 83.3%, 79.1%, 86.6%, and 90.9%. The incidence of complications was 18.6%, 11.1%, 15.4%, 20.1%, and 18.8%, respectively. The results of the study indicate that intervertebral body fusion and internal fixiation restore spinal physiologic height, improve fusion rate, and reduce postoperative recurrence and screw or rod breakage rates after fusion.

5044250606	Experimental study on the function of monocytes after multiple injuries	Background: Plasma fibronectin (Fn) is the regulator of phagocytic function of mononuclear phagocytes. After multiple injuries, obvious and regular changes will happen to plasma Fn. It has been reported that the monocytic activity in peripheral blood increased in in vitro circulation of dogs, while the changes of Fn in the cells are still not clear. Objective: To detect the Fn on the surface of monocytes and mononuclear phagocytic functions in the peripheral blood of dogs with multiple injuries. Design: A randomized controlled experimental study. Setting and participants: Sixteen dogs with multiple injuries that were made randomly were used in the experiment. These dogs were 1-4 years old, with an average age of 2.5 years. Intervention: Monocytes in the peripheral blood of the dogs were collected by gradient centrifugation. Main outcome measures: Mononuclear phagocyte function of the dogs with multiple injuries; Fn on the surface of monocytes; plasma Fn. Results: The phagocyte function of monocytes of the dogs with multiple injuries was (0.263 ± 0.048), (0.388 ± 0.087), (0.472 ± 0.137) respectively on days 1, 3, 7 after the injuries and it was strengthened obviously on day 7 after the injuries (t = 1.07, P < 0.05); the plasma Fn level was (0.144 ± 0.002) g/L on day 3 after the injuries, and it was (0.152 ± 0.003) g/L on day 7 after the injuries. These were obviously higher than that of the first day (0.125 ± 0.009) g/L. The mononuclear phagocyte function was significantly correlated with the plasma Fn level (r = 0.099, P = 0.05). The changes of Fn on the surface of monocytes showed no significant difference. Conclusion: The Fn on the monocyte surface showed dynamic changes after the injuries and this was consistent with the changes of the phagocyte function and the plasma Fn level. The results are of important value in evaluating the changes of monocytic function after the injuries.

67649538536	A portable spinal fixation guiding device: Design, preparation and preliminary application	Objective: To design a portable real-time monitoring tool for spine surgery and to preliminarily evaluate its application,so as to reduce the iatrogenic injury during the treatment of battle field spinal cord injury. Methods: A portable spine guiding device for spinal fixation was designed and prepared. The spinal specimens were randomly divided into control group (n = 10) and experimental group (n = 10). In the control group the way was cleared for the pedicle according to the doctor's experience; in the experimental group the way was cleared using our self-designed guiding device. The operation time was recorded in the two groups. After manipulation the specimens were opened along the pedicle level; the location and the depth of the needle were compared. Results;The manipulation time of a single vertebral body was (0. 5 + 0. 2) min in the control group and (0. 6 + 0. 1) min in the experimental group (P>0. 05). The edge of the puncture to the pedicle wall in the control group was significantly shorter than that in the experimental group ([1. 1 + 0. 3] vs [1. 8 + 0. 2] mm,P = 0. 037). Conclusion:The designed portable guiding device for spinal fixation is easy to carry, simple to operate; and initial in vitro application is satisfactory and can provide reliable reference for early operation.

69549115187	Safe angle scope for posterior atlanto-occipital transarticular screw fixation	OBJECTIVE: To study the technical parameters related to, and explore the clinical significance of, posterior atlanto-occipital transarticular screw fixation. METHODS: Posterior implantation of Kirschner wires via the atlanto-occipital joint was performed on 20 dry bone specimens with complete atlanto-occipital joints. The angle of the Kirschner wire was measured on a postimplantation x-ray. Three-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction of the atlanto-occipital joint of 30 healthy adults was performed to measure the simulative safety range for screw placement in posterior atlanto-occipital transarticular screw fixation. The procedure was then conducted on 12 fresh cadaver occipitocervical specimens. X-rays and 3-dimensional computed tomographic reconstruction were performed postsurgery to verify exact screw positioning. RESULTS: The ideal angles for screw placement were cephalocaudal angle in the sagittal plane of 53.3 ± 3.4 degrees, mediolateral angle in the coronal plane of 20.0 ± 2.6 degrees, a maximum allowable cephalocaudal angle of 74.6 ± 2.8 degrees (67.9-80.5 degrees), a minimum allowable cephalocaudal angle of 24.9 ± 1.9 degrees (22.1-29.4 degrees), a maximum allowable mediolateral angle of 40.5 ± 2.9 degrees (31.1-49.4 degrees), and a minimum allowable mediolateral angle of 0.7 ± 1.6 degrees (-4.1-5.9 degrees). Surgery simulation in the fresh cadaver specimens indicated that this safe scope is reliable. CONCLUSION: There is a safe scope for the angle of the screw placement in posterior atlanto-occipital transarticular screw fixation. Posterior transarticular screw fixation can be safely performed for occipitocervical fusion fixation when utilizing careful screw placement. Copyright © by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

68849122990	Removal of posterior longitudinal ligament in anterior decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy	STUDY DESIGN: The clinical and radiologic results of the patients with removed posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) were compared with those of the patients with preserved PLL in the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). OBJECTIVE: To investigate effect of resection of the PLL in anterior decompression for CSM. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Anterior decompression has been proved to be effective in the treatment of CSM, and the pathogenic matters including herniated disc, proliferative osteophyte, and ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament should be definitely removed. However, it still remains controversial to remove degenerative or hypertrophic PLL, considering the potential risks of dura tears and neurologic injury. METHODS: Between March 1997 and December 2002, 58 patients who underwent anterior decompression for CSM were included in this study. Among them, the PLL was removed in 31 patients (PLL removed group) and that was preserved in the other 27 patients (PLL preserved group). The clinical [Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score] and radiologic (diameter of the spinal cord on magnetic resonance image) results were compared between 2 groups. The risk of complications and reoperation was also evaluated. RESULTS: With a 12-month follow-up, the mean JOA score increased from 10.4±1.8 to 15.2±1.2 in PLL removed group and that increased from 10.7±1.6 to 14.6±1.1 in PLL preserved group. The improvement rate between 2 groups was significantly different (74%±23% vs. 63%±21%, P<0.01). Radiologic study showed that the increase of diameter of the spinal cord in PLL removed group was significantly greater than that in PLL preserved group (3.78±1.25 mm vs. 2.02±1.03 mm P<0.01). Only 1 patient with PLL removed developed cerebrospinal fluid leakage after operation, and 8 patients (5 with PLL preserved and 3 with PLL removed) need posterior revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Removal of PLL was generally safe and helpful to get more decompression in anterior approach for CSM, although more technically demanding. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

68049119925	Anterior decompression and interbody fusion with BAK/C for cervical disc degenerative disorders	STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective clinical study of 64 patients who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with BAK/C for disc degenerative disorders. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of BAK/C in the treatment of cervical disc degenerative disorders. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDF has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of cervical disc degenerative disorders. BAK/C, a kind of thread cage widely used for interbody fusion in the lumbar spine, was used in the cervical spine to avoid the donor site complications of traditional autologous bone graft. METHODS: Sixty-four patients with cervical disc degenerative disorders underwent ACDF with BAK/C technique in our institution between September 1997 and December 2000. All the patients were followed up for at least 6 years. The changes of segmental stability, bone fusion, cervical lordosis, and intervertebral height on radiographs were evaluated in detail immediately after operation, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively, and yearly thereafter. The clinical outcome of neurologic improvement and pain relief was also investigated. RESULTS: Solid fusion was achieved at 1 year postoperatively in all patients, and the segmental stability was maintained during the whole follow-up. The cervical lordosis and intervertebral height were well restored immediately after operation, and gradually lost during the follow-up. Especially, the anterior height of intervertebral space decreased significantly after 1 year, when compared with the anterior height immediately after operation. BAK/C subsidence was observed in 9 patients, including 5 with 1-level fusion, 1 with 2-separated-level fusion, and 3 with 2-adjacent-level fusion, according to the standard of loss of intervertebral height more than 3 mm. BAK/C fusion was generally effective in the treatment of cervical disc degenerative disorders, according to the evaluation of neurologic improvement and pain relief. However, neck pain tended to reoccur in the patients with cage subsidence, and 2 of them even needed revision surgery because of the recurrence of myelopathy and progressive neck pain. CONCLUSIONS: Although BAK/C technique was generally effective and safe in the treatment of cervical disc degenerative disorders, the pitfalls of cage design resulted in the disability of maintenance of cervical lordosis and intervertebral height in the long-term follow-up. Cage subsidence, which tended to develop in the patients with 2-level fusion, was possibly responsible for the recurrence of neck pain. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

68249138150	Cauda equina syndrome: A review of clinical progress	Objective: To review the literature on the clinical progress in cauda equina syndrome (CES), including the epidemic history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment policy and prognosis. Data sources: All reports on CES in the literature were searched in PubMed, Ovid, Springer, Elsevier, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Disk using the key terms "cauda equina syndrome", "diagnosis", "treatment", "prognosis" and "evidence-based medicine". Study selection: Original milestone articles and critical reviews written by major pioneer investigators about the cauda equina syndrome were selected. Results: CES is rare, both atraumatically and traumatically. Males and females are equally affected. The incidence of CES is variable, depending on the etiology of the syndrome. The most common cause of CES is herniation of a lumbar intervertebral disc. CES symptoms may have sudden onset and evolve rapidly or sometimes chronic ally. Each type of CES has different typical signs and symptoms. Low back pain may be the most significant symptoms, accompanied by sciatica, lower extremities weakness, saddle or perianal hypoesthesia, sexual impotence, and sphincter dysfunction. MRI is usually the preferred investigation approach. Patients who have had CES are difficult to return to a normal status. Conclusions: The diagnosis of CES is primarily based on a careful history inquiry and clinical examination, assisted by elective radiologic investigations. Early diagnosis and early surgical decompression are crucial for a favorable outcome in most CES cases.

70449484776	C1 lateral mass-C2 pedicle screws and crosslink compression fixation for unstable atlas fracture	Study Design. Primary clinical trial of limited fixation for unstable Atlas fracture. Objectives. To clinically validate feasibility, safety and value of the C1 later-mass screw C2 pedicle screw and crosslink compression fixation technique. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATE.: In previous clinical studies, several techniques have been introduced to fix Atlas fracture. But all these treatments have intrinsic disadvantages. Now seeking a means of limited internal fixation has become a worthwhile subject of clinical study. MATERIALS AND Methods. From January 2001 to December 2004, 17 cases of atlas fracture were diagnosed consecutively, 11 cases were operated on with C1 lateral mass and C2 pedicle screws and crosslink fixation, of whom 6 patents had axial instability and rupture of transverse ligament, 1 patient had C2 laminal fracture, and the remaining 4 patients had axial instability. With the assistant of regional anatomy study and fluoroscopy C1 lateral mass screws and C2 pedicle screws were implanted in place, between which connecting rods were applied bilaterally. A crosslink compression was applied between the 2 rods to achieve realignment of C1 lateral mass fracture and C0-C1-C2 into the anatomic position. C1-C2 fusion with posterior bone grafting was performed in patients with axial instability or transverse ligament discontinuity. Results. Operative time ranged from 90 to 176 minutes with a mean of 124 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss ranged from 270 to 1200 mL with a mean of 432 mL. There were no neurologic deficits, vertebral artery related complications or other complications in all patients. No deterioration of the neurologic deficits was noticed 5 days after operation when the patients were brace fixed and began to ambulate. No cerebral hemodynamic deficit was observed in this patient. Radiograph examination showed bone fusion and stability in all patients 3 months after operation. Healing of C2 fracture was confirmed by computed tomography scan. Conclusion. Osteosynthesis of the atlas by C1 lateral mass screws C2 pedicle screws and crosslink compres- sion fixation is an ideal option for C1 burst fracture with or without rupture of the transverse ligament. The procedure allows for partially physiologic reconstruction of the C0-C1-C2 joint and shortens external fixation. © 2009, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

0035258890	Direct repair of defect in lumbar spondylolysis and mild isthmic spondylolisthesis by bone grafting, with or without facet joint fusion	Forty-six patients with lumbar spondylolysis and mild isthmic spondylolisthesis were managed with direct repair of the defect with or without facet joint fusion in the affected segment. There were 24 males and 22 females, ranging in age from 15 to 56 years (average, 38.2 years). These patients had experienced clinical symptoms due to spondylolysis for between 4 months and 20 years (average, 5.3 years). Of 46 patients, 28 had no spondylolisthesis, 11 had Meyerding grade I vertebral slippage and 7 had grade II. Direct repair of 98 defects was performed on these patients. Twenty-six patients, in whom the disc adjacent to the defect was determined as degenerative by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), simultaneously underwent facet joint fusion; 17 in one segment and 9 in two segments. The average period of follow-up was 50 months (24-92 months). Ninety-four defects achieved bony healing. As a result, 28 patients were graded as having an excellent outcome, 15 good, and 3 fair. Bone grafting in the defects achieves union between the loose lamina and the anterior element of lumbar vertebrae, and reconstructs the anatomic structure and physiologic functions of the lumbar vertebrae. There was no significant difference in outcome between the spondylolytic/spondylolisthetic patients with non-degenerative disc, who were treated with direct repair of defect only, and those with degenerative disc, who additionally underwent a fusion procedure (P>0.05). The present series demonstrates a satisfactory result and a high rate of bony healing of the pars defect by this operative procedure in patients with lumbar spondylolysis and mild isthmic spondylolisthesis. Preoperative assessment of the disc degeneration with MRI is of great assistance in making the protocol choice of whether to opt for fusion. © Springer-Verlag 2000.

0035296323	The relationship between cartilage end-plate calcification and disc degeneration: An experimental study	Objective: To study the relationship between cartilage end-plate calcification and intervertebral disc degeneration. Methods: An experimental model of cervical disc degeneration in rabbits was established by resection of the cervical supraspinous and interspinous ligaments and detachment of the posterior paravertebral muscles from the cervical vertebrae. Mechanical instability in the cervical spine elicited by this surgical intervention accelerated the process of intervertebral disc degeneration. The extent of intervertebral disc degeneration was graded in morphologically, and the thicknesses of the calcified layer and the uncalcified layer of the cartilage end-plate were measured in each degenerated cervical disc. Results: In less severely degenerative cervical discs, the morphology of the cartilage end-plate showed nearly normal construction, and the tidemark was clear. In severely degenerative discs, the matrix and cells showed fibrosis, the tidemark advanced, and the calcified cartilage thickened. There exists a positive correlation between the thickness of the calcified layer of the cartilage end-plate and the degree of cervical disc degeneration. Conclusion: The calcification of the cartilage end-plate is the key factor that initiates and promotes cervical disc degeneration.

77951938702	Solitary plasmacytoma of cervical spine: Treatment and prognosis in patients with neurological lesions and spinal instability	STUDY DESIGN.: A consecutive series of 19 cases of solitary plasmacytoma (SP) of cervical spine that underwent surgical treatment and one case that underwent pure radiotherapy were observed from 1995 to 2006. OBJECTIVE.: To discuss the clinical characteristics, therapeutic methods and factors affecting prognosis of SP in the cervical spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: SP of bone is a rare plasma cell tumor which represents the proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells without evidence of significant bone marrow plasma cell infiltration. Although radical radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for SP of the bone, recommendations for treatment methods of this disease have been solely based on limited data from retrospective studies. METHODS.: Data of 20 patients with SP of the cervical spine that were identified and treated between January 1995 and December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 13 men and 7 women ranging in age from 32 to 76 years with a mean of 56 years. Among them, 1 patient underwent radiotherapy alone, and the other 19 patients received surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy. According to the Weinstein-Boriani-Biagini staging system, the surgical procedures consisted of subtotal resection and gross-total resection. All cases were managed using an anterior approach or a combined anterior and posterior approach in 1 stage. Reconstruction of the cervical spine was achieved through an anterior cervical titanium plate and titanium mesh cage filled with autoiliac graft or bone cement, or anterior and posterior combined instrumented fusion. All surgery patients received radiotherapy as adjunctive therapy postoperatively. RESULTS.: Follow-up of the 20 patients ranged from 25 to 132 months with a mean of 61 months. Neck pains improved significantly, and motor or sensory deficits disappeared or improved in varying degrees after surgery. Neurologic function level of the patients improved by 1 to3 grades based on the Frankel grading system 3 months after surgery. All the internal fixations fused well, stability of the cervical vertebrae was secure, and no spinal instability was observed in our series. The bone graft fusion rate reached 100%. During the follow-up period, 4 surgery cases progressed to multiple myeloma (MM), in which 2 elderly patients died of respiratory and circulatory failure at 90 and 43 months, respectively. The other 15 patients achieved disease-free survival after surgery with adjunctive radiotherapy. No significant abnormity was detected on M protein, bone marrow aspiration, and emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography/computed tomography examinations. CONCLUSION.: SP of the cervical spine is relatively rare, and no typical early symptoms are present. Gross total tumor resection or total spondylectomy by piecemeal manner with adjuvant radiotherapy can markedly reduce local recurrences and lower the possibility of progressing to MM. Patients with progression to MM should be treated with individualized chemotherapy, but the prognosis may be poor. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

77952521742	Bone graft fusion in goat model implanted with anterior cervical-adjustable fusion fixator after anterior cervical corpectomy: An observation of outcome	Objective: To observe the bone graft fusion of goat cervical model implanted with anterior cervical-adjustable fusion fixator(AC-AFF), laying a foundation for future studies. Methods: Eighteen experiment goats were implanted with AC-AFF, titanium mesh and autogenous iliac bone combined cervical plate after corpectomy. Six months later, the fused cervical spine vertebrae were collected, prepared, and observed grossly, under microscope, by X-ray photographs and CT scan; the fusion of the graft was evaluated. Meanwhile, the fusion of AC-AFF with the adjacent vertebral surface was observed. Results: All the experiment animals survived after operation; all the implants were stable, without displace or loosening. The interface where the titanium or AC-AFF contacts the vertebral body surface was bulged and ossified. All iliac bone graft fused well and a great deal of bony callus was found covering the vertebral body surface. Lucency area was not seen surrounding the bone graft, titanium and AC-AFF on the X-ray films, and there was new bone formation in the interface of internal fixation and bone. The central region of titanium and AC-AFF became vague and new bone formation was found in the intracavitary area of implants by CT scan. And part of the new bone transited the parietal reticulation and connected with normal ossea at titanium and AC-AFF. A large number of phoroblasts and chondrocytes were found microscopically in the bone fusion sites in all cases; however, the region without bony callus still existed in the titanium mesh lateral wall. Conclusion: There are no differences in bone fusion between AC-AFF with titanium mesh and autogenous iliac bone combined cervical plate. New phoroblasts and chondrocytes can be generated in the bone graft interface. AC-AFF has been proven as an important method for cervical stability reconstruction after decompression operation.

77952979809	En bloc resection of lamina and ossified ligamentum flavum in the treatment of thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum	Objective: We performed a retrospective patient chart review to determine the feasibility and safety of en bloc resection of lamina and ossified ligamentum flavum in the treatment of thoracic ossification of ligamentum flavum (OLF). Methods: From January 2000 to June 2006, 36 patients with thoracic OLF underwent en bloc resection of lamina and ossified ligamentum flavum by a burr-grinding technique. The range of resection included one lamina superior and one lamina inferior to the diseased segments. Ossified dura mater was removed if present, and simultaneous repair was carried out. Results: The mean preoperative Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score (an evaluation system for thoracic myelopathy with a total score of 11 points) was 5 points (range, 3-9 points). The mean JOA score at the last follow-up visit (mean follow-up period, 3.9 years) was 8.44 points (range, 6-11 points). The range of improvement was from 2 to 6 points, and the mean improvement rate was 60.5% (range, 33.3%-100%). No postoperative aggravation of neurological dysfunction, leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), wound infection, kyphosis, or recurrence occurred. A CSF cyst found in one patient 3 weeks postoperatively was absorbed automatically after 10 months. Conclusion: The en bloc resection technique described here is both safe and effective.

77954437141	The experimental study of neurobehavior and histopathology in diabetic rats following spinal cord injury	Objective: To study the neurological recovery in diabetic rats following spinal cord injury(SCI). Method: Experimental diabetes was produced by once intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in adult male SD rats. SCI animal model was made by Allen's method. The rats were divided into sham-control group, sham-diabetic group, SCI -control group, SCI-diabetic group randomly. Postinjury neurological function in every experimental rat was assessed using inclined plane test daily for 10 d. Pathological changes in spinal cord were studied at the 1st d and 10th d post trauma. Result: The critical angle of inclined plane test in diabetic rats was significantly lower as compared to that in control rats following SCI. Histopathological changes were more significant in diabetic rats than that in control rats following SCI. Conclusion: It was suggested that diabetic animals were more susceptible to free radicals and resulted in poor recovery of neurological function following SCI.

77955656074	Eosinophilic granuloma of spine in adults: A report of 30 cases and outcome	Background Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) of the spine is rare, especially in adults. There had been few large and long-term studies reported in the literature. The management goals of this disease in adults are preservation of neurologic function, relief of pain and reconstruction of spinal stability. However, there are still controversies over appropriate management modality of eosinophilic granuloma. Methods Clinical manifestations, radiographic presentations, therapeutic outcomes and follow-up findings of 30 adults who were histiologically diagnosed with spinal eosinophilic granuloma, including 28 patients who received surgical treatment at our institutions from 1985 to 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. Results There were 25 males and five females with a mean age of 34.5 years (range, 18-71 years). The post-operative follow-up period ranged from 2 to 22.4 years (mean, 8.3 years). Neurologic deficits developed in 21 patients, apparent kyphosis developed in four cases. In contrast to the classic feature of vertebra plana in children, we found that more severe lesions often led to asymmetric collapse in adult patients and only three patients presented with vertebra plana. Thirty-three vertebral lesions distributed throughout the spine column. Twenty-one lesions were in cervical spine, seven in the thoracic spine and five in the lumbar spine. Twenty-eight adult patients underwent surgical resection with or without chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and four (13.3%) patients had recurrence after surgery. No patient in our series died. Conclusions The onset of spinal EG is insidious and mainly presents as osteolytic destruction. There is a particular high prevalence of lesions in the cervical spine and more severe lesions often led to asymmetric collapse. As the skeleton of adults is well-developed and the epiphysis has stopped growing, individualized management including surgical intervention should be considered in adult patients with spinal EG who present with neurological damage and spinal instability.

77954940809	Research on correlative factor of spinal segment distribution in cervical hyperextension injury	Objective To discuss the degenerative factors, the spinal segment distribution, and the mechanism in hyperextension injury of cervical spine. Method Eighty-nine patients with hyperextension injury of cervical spine were retrospectively analyzed by observing the degenerativelesion, the spinal cord segment with high signal in T2WI, and the location of facial trauma. Results Fifty-eight cases showed the disc herniation which was ., the most common lesion, followed by 8 cases showing the calcification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Besides, 7 cases presented the developmental stenosis of spinal canal, and also, 6 cases showed disc herniation combined with the yellow ligament hypertrophy. The intervertebral level of the spinal cord with high signal in T2WI were distributed as follows:4 cases were at C2/3, of which onesuffered the forehead trauma; 12 cases were at C3/ 4, of which 10 had the forehead trauma, and one had the zygomatic trauma; 12 cases were at C4/5, of which 5 had the forehead trauma, one had both the zygomatic and the forehead trauma, and one had both the forehead and with the lower jaw trauma; 11 cases were at C5/6,of which 3 had the forehead trauma, 3 had the zygomatic trauma, and 2 had the lower jaw trauma. The location of the spinal cord with single high signal in T2WI did not correspond with the intervertebral disc level in 4 cases. For 10 cases the high signal in T2WI was found at two discontinuous segments.For 2 cases the 1 high signal in T2WI was found at over two segments. For 6 cases the high signal in T2WI was found at over three segments. Conclusions Disc herniation is the most common underlyding factor in cervical hyperextension injury. The spinal level with high signal in T2WI was correlative to the impacted facial site. The shear force at the inflection point with or without the anterior-posterior compression force accounted for the cervical hyperextension injury.

77956482007	Preparation and release study of methotrexate loaded PLGA-nanocapsules in vitro	OBJECTIVE: To prepare (MTX) loaded nanocapsules using the biodegradable materials-poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and to study the release behavior of the nanocapsules in vitro. METHODS: MTX loaded PLGA nanocapsules were made by double emulsion (W/O/W)-liquid drying process with poly (L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLCA) as carrier materials. The mophology of the nanocapsules was observed by transmission electron microscope. The mean diameter, size distribution, recovery, drug loading, incorporation efficiency, stability and the drug release behavior were determined. RESULTS: MTX loaded PLGA nanocapsules were spherical with the mean size of (161.2 ± 6.7) nm, the drug loading of (4.23 ± 0.77)% and the encapsulation efficiency of (62.1 ± 3.8)%. The in vitro release property were discribed by the first order kinetics equation: In (1 - Y) = - 0.004 1t - 0.0648 (r = 0.9845). CONCLUSION: MTX can be encapsuled in PLGA nanocapsules which showed significant sustained release. The PLGA nanocapsules are promising for loading MTX in anti-cancer drug delivery system.

78549287449	In vivo experimental study of hat type cervical intervertebral fusion cage (HCIFC)	The purpose of this study was to compare the characteristics of interbody fusion achieved using the hat type cervical intervertebral fusion cage (HCIFC) with those of an autologous tricortical iliac crest graft, Harms cage and the carbon cage in a goat cervical spine model. Thirty-two goats underwent C3-4 discectomy and fusion. They were subdivided into four groups of eight goats each: group 1, autologous tricortical iliac crest bone graft; group 2, Harms cage filled with autologous iliac crest graft; group 3, carbon cage filled with autologous iliac bone; and group 4, HCIFC filled with autologous iliac graft. Radiography was performed pre- and postoperatively and after one, two, four, eight and 12 weeks. At the same time points, disc space height, intervertebral angle, and lordosis angle were measured. After 12 weeks, the goats were killed and fusion sites were harvested. Biomechanical testing was performed in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending to determine the stiffness and range of motion. All cervical fusion specimens underwent histomorphological analyses. One week after operation, the disc space height (DSH), intervertebral angle (IVA) and lordosis angle (LA) of HCIFC and carbon cage were statistically greater than those of autologous iliac bone graft and Harms cage. Significantly higher values for DSH, IVA and LA were shown in cage-treated goats than in those that received bone graft over a 12-week period. The stiffness of Harms cage in axial rotation and lateral bending were statistically greater than that of other groups. Radiographic and histomorphological evaluation showed better fusion results in the cage groups than in the autologous bone group. HCIFC can provide a good intervertebral distractability and sufficient biomechanical stability for cervical fusion. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

78650569872	Anterior cervical decompression technique via intervertebral space under microscope	Objective To discuss the technique of the anterior cervical decompression via intervertebral space under microscope. Methods A total of 271 patients with cervical disc herniation underwent anterior microsurgical decompression and intervertebral fusion from Jun. 2000.6 to Dec. 2005. The patients included 178 cases with single level herniation, 71 with double level ones, and 22 with three level ones. MRI images showed slight or medium anterior compression with slight abnormal changes within spinal cord in all cases. The main equipment included operation microscope for neurosurgery and high speed bur. The annular fibrous and osteophytes were removed by high speed bur to expose and clean the degenerative nucleus pulpous. We lifted the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) with tension using a hook-like stripper and cut it; then the residual PLL and posterior bony edges were removed. Results There were no severe complications such as injuries of the spinal cord, nerve root or blood vessels. The average intraoperative blood loss was (126 + 29. 4) ml and the mean operative time was (62+12. 4) min. The average time for the patients to get off bed was (1. 8 + 0. 4) days. The nerve functions were improved in all patients after operation, with the excellent nerve function found in 69 cases, good in 157 cases, fair in 27 cases, and poor in 18 cases according to JOA scores. Conclusion Anterior cervical decompression via intervertebral space under microscope is suitable for treatment of pathological changes of the intervertebral space; delicate manipulation under microscope and high speed bur can contribute to a successful operation; and the anatomy of intervertebral space is more suitable for the biomechanics of the cervical vertebrate.

78651581131	Biomechanics of lumbar spondylolysis: Finite element modeling and validation	Objective To construct three-dimensional finite element model of lumbar spondylolysis, then to verify its validity by comparison of biomechanics in vitro. Method According to the radiological data of a patient with lumbar spondylolysis, the bone and intervertebral disc of L4-S1 were reconstructed by Simpleware software. The lumbar attaching ligaments and articular capsule were added into simulating model by Ansys software. The three-dimensional finite element model of lumbar spondylolysis was finally simulated successfully, and validated by lumbar spondylolysis biomechanical experiment in vitro. Results The reconstruction of digital model contained the bones of lumbar spine which include vertebral cortical bone, cancellous bone, facet joint, pedicle, lamina, transverse process and spinous process, as well as the annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus, superior and inferior end-plates. Besides, anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, flavum ligament, supraspinal and interspinal ligaments and articular capsule of facet joint are also attached. The model consisted of 281, 261 nodes and 661, 150 elements. Imitation of spondylolysis is well done in this model. The validity of the model was verified by comparison of the results of biomechanics in vitro which involved in the trends under loading of stress/strain of L4 inferior facet process, L5 superior and inferior facet process, S1 superior facet process and the trends of stress/strain of lateral and medial L4 inferior facet process. Conclusions Three-dimensional model of lumbar spondylolysis is reconstructed using finite element analysis, and can be further used in the research in biomechanics of lumbar spondylolysis.

79151485699	PTEN deletion prevents ischemic brain injury by activating the mTOR signaling pathway	It is increasingly clear that the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) is a negative regulator of neuronal cell survival. However, its molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we found that PTEN/mTOR is critical for controlling neuronal cell death after ischemic brain injury. Male rats were subjected to MCAO (middle cerebral artery occlusion) followed by pretreating with bpv (pic), a potent inhibitor for PTEN, or by intra-cerebroventricular infusion of PTEN siRNA. bpv (pic) significantly decreased infarct volume and reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells. We further demonstrated that although bpv (pic) did not affect brain injury-induced mTOR protein expression, bpv (pic) prevented decrease in phosphorylation of mTOR, and the subsequent decrease in S6. Similarly, down-regulation of PTEN expression also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and increased phospho-mTOR. These data suggest that PTEN deletion prevents neuronal cell death resulting from ischemic brain injury and that its neuroprotective effects are mediated by increasing the injury-induced mTOR phosphorylation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

79955123697	Finite element analysis on intra-segmental fixation and inter-segmental fixation for lumbar spondylolysis	Objective: To compare the stresses on the end plate of adjacent lumbar vertebrae between intra-segmental fixation and inter-segmental fixation in treating lumbar spondylolysis by three-dimensional finite element analysis. Method: Based on the established finite element model of L4 lumbar spondylolysis, the lumbar internal fixation such as rods and trans-pedicle screws were reconstructed to make the finite element models of intra-segmental and inter-segmental internal fixation with the same constraint and loading conditions. The stresses on endplate of adjacent lumbar vertebrae of finite element models were measured under three mechanical conditions: spondylolysis, intra-segmental fixation and inter-segmental fixation. Results: High stresses were observed under two kinds of internal fixation conditions compared with the spondylolysis condition at the lower endplate of L4 under axial loading(P<0.05). The stresses at the lower endplate of L4 under intra-segmental fixation condition were similar as that of the spondylolysis condition under flexion, extension and lateral bending loading. With the same loading, higher stresses were observed under inter-segmental fixation condition compared with the spondylolysis condition, and so did the lower stresses at upper endplate of S1(P<0.05). The lower stresses at the upper endplate of S1 under intra-segmental fixation condition were observed compared with the other two conditions under rotating loading (P<0.05). Conclusions: The intra-segmental fixation can not only provide stability for lumbar spondylolysis under axial, flexion, extension, lateral bending, but also preserve the normal activity at adjacent disc levels, especially under rotating loading.

0036202414	Early and late outcomes in patients with severe extracranial internal carotid stenosis undergoing carotid endarterectomy	Objective. To determine the perioperative and late outcomes for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in treatment of patients with high-grade stenotic lesions of the extracranial internal carotid artery. Methods. Twenty patients underwent 21 CEAs at the Zhongshan Hospital between May 1993 and June 2000. They were 19 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 64 ± 9 years. Seven patients were performed for stroke, 11 for transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and 2 for asymptomatic disease. Duplex scan was the primary tool of evaluation prior to surgery. Perioperative digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance angiography were done for 19 and 18 patients, respectively. The percentage of stenosis was calculated using NASCET criteria. Of the 21 lesions operated, 19 had a stenosis of 70% or greater, 2 had ulcerative lesions with a stenosis ranging from 60% to 69%. All CEAs were performed under cervical block anaesthesia with selective intraoperative shunting and patch angioplasty. The patients were followed up regularly with duplex scan surveillance. Results. There was no mortality or stroke during 30 days postoperatively. A TIA occurred in one patient and cranial nerve injury in 2 patients perioperatively. All patients were followed up for a mean interval of 31 ± 20 months (range: 1-63 months). The 2-year survival rate and risk of stroke were 92.3% and 0%, respectively, and the 5-year survival rate and risk of stroke were 79.1% and 12.5%, respectively. Two asymptomatic recurrent stenoses ranging from 50% to 60% were detected on follow-up duplex scan. Conclusions. For the patients in this study, CEA is associated with an acceptable perioperative outcome as well as a satisfactory long-term beneficial effect in stroke prevention.

79957701790	Intervertebral thoracic disc calcification associated with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament in an eleven-year-old child	Study Design.: Intervertebral disc calcification of T6-T7, T7-T8 discs associated with ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) in a child is reported. Objective.: To discuss the natural history and management of calcification of T6-T7, T7-T8 discs with OPLL. Summary of Background Data.: Calcified intervertebral discs are rare in children. Cervical disc calcification has already been described. However, thoracic disc calcification associated with OPLL has not been reported. Methods.: An 11-year-old boy presented with progressive back pain for 6 months. Neurologic examination showed numbness in both lower extremities. The knee jerk reflex of the patient was hypertonic. The muscle strength of both lower extremities were Grade 4, with reduction. He was treated with a lumbar belt for 2 weeks. Results.: Initial thoracic spine radiograph and CT scan showed two adjacent calcified discs of T6-T7, T7-T8 associated with T6-T7 OPLL, resulting in marked spinal canal stenosis. His neurologic symptoms subsided and his back pain disappeared after a 2-week conservative treatment. Three months later CT scan showed that the calcification of T6-T7, T7-T8 discs was aggravated, but the T6-T7 OPLL was relieved. Conclusion.: The natural history of intervertebral disc calcification is usually benign. In this case, the improvement of OPLL is associated with the stabilization of the maturely fused calcified disc. Spontaneous resolution of the OPLL and recovery of normal neurologic function can be expected with conservative treatment. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

80955166157	Sequentially staged resection and 2-column reconstruction for c2 tumors through a combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach: Surgical technique and results in 11 patients	Background: Surgical treatment of C2 tumors remains challenging. Because of the deep location and unique anatomical complexity, anterior exposure in this region is considered difficult and dangerous, and few reports concerning anterior tumor resection and reconstruction exist. Objective: To describe a technique of sequentially staged resection and 2-column reconstruction for C2 tumors through a combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach. Methods: Eleven patients with C2 tumors underwent sequentially staged tumor resection and 2-column reconstruction in our institute. Eight primary lesions and 3 metastases were involved. Tumor resections and anterior reconstructions with conventional constructs were accomplished by an anterior retropharyngeal approach, and occipitocervical fusions through posterior access were performed in the same anesthesia. Results: No operative mortality occurred in this series. All patients experienced pain relief and neurological improvement after surgery. Except for 1 incidence of screw pullout, which was corrected by revision surgery, solid fusion was achieved in all patients. A follow-up period of 12 to 37 months was available for this study. Two patients with chordoma relapsed; 1 died of disease, and the other was alive with disease. Two patients with metastasis died of multiple remote metastases. No evidence of local recurrence was found in the other patients. Conclusion: The anterior retropharyngeal approach is a favorable route to treat tumor lesions of the C2 vertebral body that allows tumor resection and placement of anterior constructs between C1 and the subaxial vertebral body. Tumor resection and 2-column reconstruction could safely be accomplished simultaneously through the combined anterior retropharyngeal-posterior approach.

84255204787	Factors associated with early mortality after cervical spinal cord injury	Background: A relatively high early mortality rate (<30 days post-injury) for cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) has been observed. Objective: To investigate this early mortality rate observed after cervical SCI and analyze the associated influential factors. Methods: Medical records for 1163 patients with cervical SCI were reviewed, and the number of patients with early mortality was documented. Through logistic regression analysis, the effects of age, gender, occupation, cause of injury, severity of injury, highest involved spinal cord segment, nutritional condition during hospitalization, surgical treatment, tracheotomy, etc., on early mortality were assessed. Implementation of early treatment (i.e. surgery, tracheotomy, and nutritional support) and its effect on patient prognosis were also analyzed. Results: Early mortality occurred in 109 of 1163 patients (9.4%). Four factors affected the early mortality rate, including level and severity of SCI, whether or not surgery was performed, the time interval between SCI and surgery, malnutrition, and tracheotomy. Patients with an American Spinal Injury Association grade of A, a high cervical SCI (C1-C3), and/or no surgical intervention were statistically more likely to have early mortality (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Severe cervical SCI, upper-level cervical cord injury, malnutrition, and inappropriate tracheotomy are risk factors for early mortality in patients with cervical SCI. Surgery can reduce early mortality. Early tracheotomy should be performed in patients with complete upper-level cervical SCI, but patients with incomplete cervical SCI or complete low-level cervical SCI should initially be treated surgically to maintain smooth airway flow. © The Academy of Spinal Cord Injury Professionals, Inc. 2011.

84856735922	Chondrosarcomas of the cervical and cervicothoracic spine: Surgical management and long-term clinical outcome	Study Design: A retrospective review study. Objectives: To estimate the clinical outcome of various resection protocols in patients with chondrosarcoma (CHS) at the challenging region of cervical and cervicothoracic spine (CCT). Summary of Background Data: It is challenging to surgically manage CHS of the spine. Although total en-bloc resection has proven to be an ideal treatment, this option is not always feasible in the spine because of the constrains of critical neurovascular structures in the vicinity. Lesions at the CCT region pose even more difficulties, and few large clinical series concerning various protocols and long-term outcomes of these lesions exist at present. Methods: Fifteen patients with CHS at the CCT region who underwent surgical management in our institute were retrospectively studied. Twelve piecemeal resections and 3 en-bloc resections were performed. Intraoperative local chemotherapy and postoperative cyberknife radiotherapy were given as adjuvant therapy. Neurologic status, local recurrence, distant metastasis, and treatment-related complications were evaluated. Results: The mean follow-up time was 58.7 months (median 37 mo; ranging from 18 to 141 mo). Local recurrence was detected in 5 of 5 cases (100%) treated by intracapsular piecemeal resection, and in 1 of 7 cases (14.3%) treated by extracapsular piecemeal resection, whereas no recurrence was found in 3 cases treated by en-bloc resection. Of the 6 recurrent patients, 5 died of disease 24 to 46 months after present surgery, and the remaining patient was alive with disease in the final follow-up. There were no signs of recurrence in the remaining 9 patients. Conclusions: For CHS at the CCT region, intralesional piecemeal resection has a poor prognosis and should be avoided. Oncologically, en-bloc resection remains the best form of disease management and should be the primary treatment of choice. For cases in which an uncontaminated en-bloc resection could not be achieved, the extracapsular piecemeal resection with adjuvant therapy including local chemotherapy and cyberknife radiotherapy is an effective and achievable option. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84856250463	Upregulated miR-29b promotes neuronal cell death by inhibiting Bcl2L2 after ischemic brain injury	It is increasingly clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in controlling cell survival. However, the functional significance of miRNAs in ischemic brain injury remains poorly understood. In the present study, we assayed the expression levels of miR-29b after ischemic brain injury, and defined the target genes and biological functions of miR-29b. We found that the miR-29b levels were significantly increased in rat brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-29b promoted neuronal cell death, whereas its repression decreased cell death. Furthermore, we verified that miR-29b directly targeted and inhibited Bcl2L2 gene expression, and then increased neuronal cell death. Importantly, Bcl2L2 overexpression rescued neuronal cell death induced by miR-29b. These results suggest an important role of miR-29b in regulating neuronal cell death, thus offering a new target for the development of therapeutic agents against ischemic brain injury. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84862840752	Diagnosis of discogenic low back pain in patients with probable symptoms but negative discography	Objective The purpose of the current study was to determine, whenever the patients complained of probable symptoms of discogenic low back pain and had obvious disc pathological changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but showed negative in discography, whether we could absolutely exclude the diagnosis of discogenic pain or not. Methods The patients we selected in our study had only one segmental disc pathology on MRI for the purpose of minimizing the interference and all patients complained of probable discogenic pain symptoms. Some special lumbar diseases were excluded by physical examination and CT or MRI scan. Finally, 45 isolated patients with negative discography were enrolled in our study from January 2006 to June 2008. Twenty-three patients were randomly distributed in experimental group, who underwent provocative discography plus intradiscal injection of dexamethasone (5 mg in each patient), while the other 22 patients in the control group received intradiscal injection of saline as a placebo. Visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were used to evaluate the changes of pain and function after discography. Results The mean age of the 16 male and 29 female patients was 44.9 years, whose main clinical manifestations included axial back pain (100%), pain in the region of Groin (33.3%), pain in the anterior or posterior region of thigh (42.2%), buttock pain (24.4%) and lower extremity pain (11.1%), and among them L3-L4 pathological disc was found in three patient, L4-L5 pathological disc in 28 patients and L5-S1 pathological disc in 14 patients. Discography and CTscans of the 45 patients revealed that there were grade 5 in 38 discs and grade 4 in seven discs by means of Modified Dallas classification. After about 6-month follow-up, the results showed that VAS scores and ODI scores were greatly improved during the first 3-month follow-up in the experimental group compared with pre-discography and between groups (p <0.05), but no statistically signi?cant difference after 24-week follow-up (p >0.05). The probable symptoms of discogenic low back pain were significantly improved in the experimental group in the short term. Conclusion The study indicated that negative discography in patients with probable symptoms of discogenic low back pain cannot absolutely exclude the diagnosis of discogenic pain. Patients of this kind may suffer from other diseases, but we cannot ignore the existence of discogenic pain. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84871335259	Posterior fusion versus posterior interbody fusion in segmental spinal fixation for aged spondylolisthesis	Objective: Clinical and radiographic results in 30 consecutive patients undergoing posterior lumbar fixation and posterior facet joint or posterior interbody fusion for Meyerding Grade II/III spondylolisthesis were assessed: (1) to address the suitability of a dynamic stabilization; and (2) to investigate whether there are differences in terms of clinical and functional results between these two types of arthrodesis. Methods: Fourteen patients underwent posterior interfacet fusion (PLF) and implantation of TSRH-3D system. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and placement of the same system were performed in 16 patients. Clinical, economic, functional and radiographic data were recorded both pre-and postoperatively. Results: The average changes in Prolo Scale of economic and functional scores were 1.25 and 1.64 respectively, in patients undergoing posterior fusion; the average measured vertebral slippage was 48.6% (range 32%-65%) preoperatively and 17.5% (range 15%-25%) postoperatively. In patients undergoing PLIF, the average changes in economic and functional score were 1.18 and 1.39 respectively, and the average preoperative vertebral slippage was 44.2% (range 30%-55%) versus 20.3% (range 18%-26%) postoperatively. Conclusion: The use of a segmental pedicle screw fixation with TSRH-3D was able to successfully combine the goal of solid fusion with the requirements of nerve root decompression. When these two fusion techniques were compared, PLIF was superior to PLF because of an overall superior reliability and system resistance. But their clinical outcomes did not differ greatly (P > 0.05). Copyright © 2009 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84871279576	Surgical treatment strategies for severe cervicothoracic kyphosis	Objective: To analyze the outcomes of surgical treatment for severe cervicothoracic kyphosis. Methods: A retrospective study was performed for a total of 7 patients with severe cervicothoracic kyphosis. There were congenital malformation (n=5) and cervicothoracic tuberculosis (n=2). The mean preoperative Cobb angle of kyphosis was 89.3° (range: 72-103°). The average JOA (Japanese Orthopedic Association) score of neurological function was 11.2 ± 1.2 points. Preoperative halo-pelvic traction was performed and maintained for 25-40 days according to the patient conditions. Then posterior instrumented fusion was performed. Results: The average postoperative JOA score was 15.4 ± 1.6 points. The mean immediate postoperative Cobb angle was 53.4° (range: 45-67°). A mean correction rate of 40.2% was achieved. All patients were followed up for a mean of 18 months (range: 10-24). And a mean correction loss of 2.5° was observed at the final follow-up. Two patients had transient upper limb pain during distraction. There were no intra-operative or post-operative occurrences of spinal cord injury and other neurological complications. Conclusion: Halo-pelvic traction plus posterior spondylodesis may be a safe and effective therapy of severe cervicothoracic kyphotic deformity. Copyright © 2011 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84873731279	Increased miR-195 aggravates neuropathic pain by inhibiting autophagy following peripheral nerve injury	Following peripheral nerve injury (PNI) microglia proliferates and adopts inflammation that contributes to development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. miRNAs and autophagy are two important factors in the regulation of inflammation. However, little is known about whether miRNAs regulate neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain by controlling autophagy. In the study, we demonstrated that miR-195 levels were markedly increased in rats subjected to L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Upregulated miR-195 was also found in spinal microglia of rats with SNL. The overexpression of miR-195 contributed to lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and iNOS in cultured microglia. Upregulated miR-195 also resulted in increased mechanical and cold hypersensitivity after PNI, whereas miR-195 inhibition reduced mechanical and cold sensitivity. We further demonstrated that PNI significantly inhibited microglial autophagy activation, whereas miR-195 inhibitor treatment increased autophagy activation and suppressed neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro. More important, autophagy inhibition impaired miR-195 inhibitor-induced downregulation of neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain. Additionally, ATG14 was identified as the functional target of miR-195. Conclusions: These data demonstrated that miR-195/autophagy signaling represents a novel pathway regulating neuroinflammation and neuropathic pain, thus offering a new target for therapy of neuropathic pain. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84874324402	Clinical observation and evaluation of resaons for pseudarthrosis after anterior cervical fusion	Objective: To explore the causes of pseudarthrosis and evaluate the clinical neurological function and neck subaxial symptoms after anterior cervical fusion. Methods: A total of 412 patients were followed up with an average of 5.4 years. The bone mineral density, bone graft trimming and placement, management of endplate, smoking and neck support fixation time were observed. Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to evaluate the changes of neurological functions and clinical outcomes. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was used to evaluate the neck subaxial symptoms. And pseudarthrosis was examined by flexion-extension radiography. SPSS statistical software 13.0 was used to evaluate the differences of JOA and VAS scores between pseudarthrosis and control groups. Results: Among them, 37 cases of pseudarthrosis were observed. There were osteoporosis (n =30 vs n = 119), cartilage end-plate punctuate hemorrhage (n = 18 vs n= 340), 25 and 43 cases with ineffective cervical external fixation (n = 25 vs n = 43) and smoking (n = 26 vs n = 87) in pseudarthrosis and fusion groups respectively. Significant differences existed in the above-mentioned indices between two groups. However, no significant difference existed in bone graft shape between two groups. There were significant differences in JOA and VAS scores between two groups. Conclusion: The causes of pseudarthrosis included decreased bone density, osteoporosis, over-curette of endplate, shortness of neck support fixation time and smoking. And pseudarthrosis may influence the long-term recovery of neurological functions or it is correlated significantly with neck symptoms. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84874362209	Clinical characteristics and early effective treatment for pulmonary infection after acute cervical spinal cord injury	Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics and early effective treatment for pulmonary infection after acute cervical spinal cord injury. Methods: A total of 215 inpatients with acute cervical spinal cord injury were retrospectively analyzed. Their chest radiological films and blood profiles at discharge were analyzed. The fourth generation cephalosporin was used to treat pulmonary infection as soon as admission and the antibiotics switched according to the results of sputum culture and drug sensitive test. Incision of trachea was performed and breath supported by breath machine according to respiratory condition and blood gas analysis. All patients were turned over and slapped on the back in order to excrete phlegm in time. Sometimes bronchial lavage was used to excrete phlegm. The chest radiological examinations and sputum culture were performed twice one week. Once fungal infection was definite, specific antibiotic was used to treat infection. Three-liter bas and nasal-feeding were used to improve the nutrition condition. Incision of trachea was closed as soon as possible. Results: Pulmonary infection of 214 patients was finally cured. Among them, 43 suffered from pulmonary closure. One patient died from severe infection of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Pulmonary infection appeared upon admission and was mostly accompanied with hyperpyrexia. The result of sputum culture revealed baumanii and the pathogen of hemoculture was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At 3-4 weeks later, mycotic infection appeared. And 17 patients suffered from Klebsiella pneumoniae and one died. Conclusion: Pulmonary infection after acute cervical spinal cord injury is severe and occurs early. Effective antibiotics according to the result of sputum culture, turnover & back-slapping for excreting phlegm in time, expectoration training and strengthening overall nutrition are effective therapeutic measures.

84877036694	Over-Expression of PUMA Correlates with the Apoptosis of Spinal Cord Cells in Rat Neuropathic Intermittent Claudication Model	Background: Neuropathic intermittent claudication (NIC) is a typical clinical symptom of lumbar spinal stenosis and the apoptosis of neurons caused by cauda equina compression (CEC) has been proposed as an important reason. Whereas, the factors and the mechanism involved in the process of apoptosis induced by CEC remain unclear. Methodology and Results: In our modified rat model of NIC, a trapezoid-shaped silicon rubber was inserted into the epidural space under the L5 and L6 vertebral plate. Obvious apoptosis was observed in spinal cord cells after compression by TUNEL assay. Simultaneously, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression levels of PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis) and p53 were upregulated significantly in spinal cord under compression, while the expression of p53 inhibitor MDM2 and SirT2 decreased in the same region. Furthermore, CEC also resulted in the upregulation of Bcl-2 pro-apoptotic genes expression and caspase-3 activation. With the protection of Methylprednisolone, the upregulation of PUMA and p53 expression as well as the decrease of MDM2 and SirT2 in spinal cord were partially rescued in western bolt analysis. Conclusions: These results suggest that over-expression of PUMA correlates with CEC caused apoptosis of spinal cord cells, which is characterized by the increase of p53, Bax and Bad expression. PUMA upregulation might be crucial to induce apoptosis of spinal cord cells through p53-dependent pathway in CEC. © 2013 Ma et al.

84878543578	Minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty in the surgical treatment of thoracolumbar osteoporosis fracture	Object. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for treating acute thoracolumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and preventing secondary VCF after PVP. Methods. Twenty patients with a mean age of 73.6 years (range 65-85 years) who sustained fresh thoracic or lumbar osteoporotic VCFs without neurological deficits underwent minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with PVP. Visual analog scale pain scores were recorded, and the Cobb angles and the central and anterior vertebral body (VB) heights were measured on the lateral radiographs before surgery and immediately, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. Results. The patients were followed up for an average of 26 months (range 24-30 months) after sugery. The visual analog scale score was found to be significantly decreased; from 7.3 ±?1.3 before surgery to 1.2 ±?0.7 immediately after surgery and to 0.7 ±?0.7 (p < 0.001) at the end of follow-up. The Cobb angle was 17.0°?±?4.3°? before surgery and 6.4°?±?3.6°?immediately after surgery. The central VB height that was 44.5% ±?7.6% before surgery increased to 74.6% ±?6.4% of the estimated intact central height immediately after surgery (p < 0.001). The anterior VB height increased from 50.7% ±?7.4% before surgery to 82.5% ±?6.7% of the estimated intact anterior height immediately after surgery (p < 0.001). There were no significant changes in the results obtained over the follow-up time period. There was no occurrence of new fracture in surgically treated or adjacent vertebrae in these patients. Conclusions. Minimally invasive pedicle screw fixation combined with PVP is a good choice for the treatment of acute thoracolumbar osteoporotic VCF and can prevent the occurrence of new VCFs after PVP. © 2013 AANS.

84879073929	Surgical technique: Hemilaminectomy and unilateral lateral mass fixation for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament spine	Background: Surgical approaches for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) include anterior, posterior, or combined decompression with or without fusion. The goal of surgery is to decompress the spinal cord while maintaining the stability and sagittal alignment of the cervical spine. C5 palsy has been reported as a postoperative complication of cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty characterized as motor weakness of the muscles supplied with C5 nerve roots. Several studies have shown this phenomenon was partially attributable to posterior shift of spinal cord. Description of Technique: The rationale for choosing hemilaminectomy is to control postoperative posterior shift of the spinal cord and afford more stability by preserving ligamentous attachments and posterior bony elements as much as possible. After a fixation system of lateral mass screws and rods is installed unilaterally, laminae are removed from the underlying dura using a high-speed burr and Kerrison laminectomy rongeur on the other side. The spinous processes are preserved. Patients and Methods: Patients with multilevel continuous/mixed cervical OPLL are good candidates for this technique. We retrospectively reviewed 146 patients who had multilevel continuous/mixed cervical OPLL and underwent surgery from January 2006 to January 2010. Neurologic condition was evaluated using the improvement ratio (IR) of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score for cervical myelopathy. Results: The mean JOA score increased from 10 points before surgery to 14 points at last followup. The mean IR of neurologic function (JOA score) was 59%. C5 palsy was not observed in any patient after decompression, and cervical lordosis changed from 8.7 preoperatively to 9.1 at last followup. Conclusions: For patients with multilevel continuous/mixed cervical OPLL without fixed kyphosis, multilevel hemilaminectomy with unilateral lateral mass fixation is an effective alternative technique. Level of Evidence: Level IV, therapeutic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence. © 2013 The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®.

84880614276	Identification of risk factors for respiratory complications in upper cervical spinal injured patients with neurological impairment	Objective: Clinical features of respiratory complications in patients with upper cervical spine injuries (CSI) are unique due to the complex regional anatomy in the region. The objective of this study was to identify the risk factors for respiratory complications in the patients with upper CSI and cervical spinal cord injuries (C-SCI). Methods: Ninety-two patients (out of 1593 spine injured patients) who met the inclusion criteria of upper CSI were admitted to our hospital from 1992 to 2010. Their records were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Respiratory complications occurred in 16 patients (17.4%). In addition, ventilator-associated pneumonia played an important role in the respiratory complications, however, no pulmonary thromboembolism was found. Death rate in respiratory complication group (RCG, 31.3%) was significantly higher than that in non-respiratory complication group (NCG, 1.3%). In RCG, severe C-SCI (American Spinal Cord Injury Association Grades A and B, OR=34.401; 95% CI, 2.609-5.525) and hypoalbuminemia (OR=24.616; 95% CI, 1.492-6.182) were identified by logistic regression analysis as main risk factors for respiratory complications; whereas levels of neurological injury, quadriplegia, atlanto-axial fractures, smoking history, and electrolyte disturbances were not identified as risk factors (although statistically relevant to respiratory complications). Conclusion: Severe C-SCI and hypoalbuminemia played important roles in predicting respiratory complications among the patients with upper CSI and neurological impairment. In addition, levels of neurological injury, quadriplegia, atlanto-axial fractures, smoking history, and electrolyte disturbances are also valuable indicators for these complications. Moreover, prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia was crucial in the treatment of these patients. However, a screening for deep venous thrombosis was seemingly unnecessary in our patients. © 2013 Turkish Association of Orthopaedics and Traumatology.

84881257216	Knockdown of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase in osteosarcoma cells leads to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis	Dysregulation of the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been implicated in the development and progression of a variety of malignancies. Axl is known to activate strong anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that promote oncogenesis. However, the role of Axl plays in osteosarcoma (OS) remains elusive. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance and function of Axl in human OS. Forty cases of OS and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) were collected. The expression of Axl was assessed using immunohistochemical assay through tissue microarray procedure. A loss-of-function experiment was performed to investigate the effects of small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of Axl on the expression of p-AKT, poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Ki-67, the proliferative activities, indicated by MTT assay, and the apoptotic index in OS MG-63 cells. As a result, the expression of Axl was found in OS tissues with higher strong reactivity rate, compared with the ANCT (75.0% vs 20.0%, P=0.000), but it did not associate with the age, gender, tumor size, TNM staging and distant metastases (each P>0.05). Furthermore, knockdown of Axl inhibited the proliferative activities and induced apoptosis in MG-63 cells with decreased expression of p-AKT, and Ki-67 and increased expression of PARP. In conclusion, our findings suggest that Axl is highly expressed in most of the OS tissues compared with the ANCT, and knockdown of Axl inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of OS cells possibly through downregulation of the AKT pathway, suggesting that our findings may provide new insights into the potential therapeutic target for cancer.

84883873565	Clinical features and surgical outcomes of patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by multilevel ossification of the ligamentum flavum	Background context: Thoracic myelopathy caused by multilevel (three or more levels) ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is rare. Little is known about its clinical features, and the surgical outcomes along with its related factors are also unclear. Purpose: To describe the clinical features, assess the safety and effectiveness of surgical decompression, and determine the prognostic factors relevant for patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by multilevel OLF. Study design/setting: A retrospective clinical study. Patient sample: Seventy-five consecutive multilevel OLF patients who underwent surgical decompression were analyzed. Outcome measures: Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scale and the recovery rate. Methods: Patients who underwent surgical decompression for symptomatic multilevel OLF during January 1996 to June 2010 were all included. Clinical data were collected from medical and operative records; patients were evaluated by using the JOA scale preoperatively and during the follow-up. Correlations between the surgical outcome and various factors were also analyzed. Results: Forty-three men and 32 women with a mean age of 54.7 years (range 36-78 years) were included. The mean number of involved levels is 4.6 and contiguous OLF presented in 73.3% of these patients. The most common involved levels were T10/T11 (15.4%), T9/T10 (13.3%), and T11/T12 (12.5%). Coexisting spinal disorders were found in 41 patients (54.7%). Preoperative evaluation showed the mean JOA score was 5.8±1.7; 37.3% of these patients had mild myelopathy, 53.3% had moderate myelopathy, and 9.3% had severe myelopathy. All patients received posterior laminectomy. The JOA score (mean 8.2±2.1) significantly increased postoperatively (p<.05), and multiple regression analysis showed that preoperative duration of symptoms and preoperative JOA score were important predictors of surgical outcome. Conclusions: Laminectomy with partially internal fixation is safe and effective in treatment of patients with symptomatic multilevel OLF. The results of our study show that preoperative JOA score and preoperative duration of symptoms were important predictors for the clinical outcome. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

84885157680	Fibroblast growth factor 2 induces mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into tenocytes through the MAPK pathway	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into numerous different cell types and thus have therapeutic potential for tissue engineering, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory purposes. FGF2 may affect the biological behavior of MSCs. MSCs were transduced with either adenovirus-null vector/green fluorescent protein (GFP) or a vector encoding for the overexpression of FGF2/GFP. The expression of FGF2 was demonstrated to be significantly higher in MSC (FGF2) compared with MSC (vector) by qPCR and western blot analysis. In order to investigate the function of FGF2 in MSCs over time, it was observed that FGF2 stimulates cell proliferation and induces cell differentiation by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Following blockade of the FGF2-induced activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway by overexpression of sprouty isoforms, the marker of differentiation markedly decreased. Altogether, the results demonstrated a novel cell biological mechanism that FGF2 differentiates into tenocytes and the MAPK pathway is key in differentiation.

84889604227	Differentiation of neonatal dorsal root ganglion-derived neural stem cells into oligodendrocytes after intrathecal transplantation into a cauda equina lesion model	Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is characterized by varying patterns of low back pain, sciatica, lower extremity sensorimotor loss, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. The prognosis for complete recovery of CES is dependent on not only the time before surgical intervention with decompression but also the severity of the nerve damage. Delayed or severe nerve compression impairs the capability of nerve regeneration. Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) may facilitate axon regeneration and functional recovery in a spectrum of neurological disorders. Our study shows that the NSCs derived from early postnatal dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are able to proliferate to form neurospheres and differentiate into O4

84892382417	Foot drop caused by lumbar degenerative disease: Clinical features, prognostic factors of surgical outcome and clinical stage	Objective: The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical features and prognostic factors of surgical outcome of foot drop caused by lumbar degenerative disease and put forward the clinical stage. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 135 patients with foot drop due to lumbar degenerative disease. The clinical features and mechanism were analyzed. Age, sex, duration of palsy, preoperative muscle strength of tibialis anterior (TA), sensation defect of affected lower limb, affected foot, diagnosis and compressed nerve roots were recorded and compared with surgical outcome. Results: Foot drop was observed in 8.1% of all inpatients of lumbar degenerative disease. L5 nerve root compression was observed in 126 of all 135 patients (93.3%). Single, double and triple roots compression was observed respectively in 43, 83, and 9 patients (31.9%, 61.5%, and 6.6%). But there was no significant relationship between preoperative muscle strength of TA and the number of compressed roots. The muscle strength of TA was improved in 113 (83.7%) patients after surgery, but it reached to >=4 in only 21 (15.6%) patients. Improvement of the muscle strength of TA was almost stable at the 6-month follow-up. At the last follow-up, the muscle strength of TA was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively in 28, 24, 62, 13, 8 patients. Multivariate logistic regression showed duration of palsy (p=0.0360, OR=2.543), preoperative muscle strength of TA (p=0.0064, OR=5.528) and age (p=0.0309, OR=3.208) were factors that influenced recovery following an operation. Conclusions: L5 nerve root was most frequently affected. The muscle strength of TA improved in most patients after surgery, but few patients can get a good recovery from foot drop. Patients of shorter duration of palsy, better preoperative muscle strength of TA and younger age showed a better surgical outcome. © 2013 Liu et al.

84898847837	Strengthened respiratory management for lower tracheostomy risks in patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury	Objective: To access the feasibility of reducing tracheostomy rates in patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury through a systemic respiratory management mode. Methods: A retrospective review was performed for 239 patients on a systemic respiratory management mode after complete cervical spinal cord injury in Shanghai Changzheng Hospital from 2006 to 2012. Their demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, cause of injury, level of cervical spinal cord injuries, surgical approaches, tracheostomy rates and mortality rates, were collected and analyzed. Tracheostomy rates were compared with those of patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury. Tracheostomy rates were compared with those patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury from 1991 to 2005. The new respiratory management mode for patients with severe cervical spinal cord injury included maintaining adequate energy and water for patients, relieving bronchospasm, loosening phlegm, strengthening body-turning and hackslapping, sputum aspiration with suction tube through nasal cavity or bronchofibroscope, strengthening deep breath and cough training, strict control of tracheostomy indications and short-term postoperative intubation reserving if necessary. Results: 32 patients were implemented tracheostomy. The tracheostomy rate was 13.4%. 10 patients died, the mortality rate was 4.18%. However, the tracheostomy rate was 19.1% and mortality rate 21.4% from 1991 to 2005. The tracheostomy rate was significantly lower than before and survival rate improved significantly. Conclusion: The systemic respiratory management mode can effectively reduce tracheostomy rate of patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury and improve their survival rate.

84904286807	BDNF-mediated modulation of glycine transmission on rat spinal motoneurons	BDNF has a widespread distribution in the central and peripheral nervous systems, suggesting that BDNF may play a role in the regulation of motor control. However, the direct actions of BDNF on the motoneurons and their underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown to date. Therefore, by using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, quantitative RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of BDNF on electrical activity and glycinergic transmission on the motoneurons and the underlying receptor mechanism. The results reveal: (i) BDNF did not produce a direct excitatory or inhibitory effect on the motoneurons; (ii) BDNF dose-dependently increased the glycinergic transmission on the motoneurons; (iii) glycinergic transmission on motoneurons was a direct postsynaptic effect; (iv) BDNF-induced enhancement of the glycinergic transmission was mediated by the activation of TrkB receptors; and (v) BDNF and its receptors TrkB had an extensive expression in the motoneurons. These results suggest that BDNF is directly involved in the regulation of glycinergic transmission on the motoneurons through postsynaptic TrkB receptors. Considering that the glycinergic synaptic transmission of motoneurons mainly comes from Renshaw cells, the important inhibitory interneurons of spinal cord, we speculate that BDNF may play an important role in the information integration in the spinal cord and participate in the sensitivity of motoneurons. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

11344254013	Expression of bcl-2 and bax apoptosis gene after decompression of chronic cervical cord compression in rabbits	Aim: To investigate the pathophysiological mechanism of spinal cord decompression in the treatment of chronic cervical compression by observing the expression of bcl-2 and bax of the chronic cervical compression in rabbits model after spinal cord decompression. Methods: Twenty-one Chinese white rabbits that underwent chronic cervical cord compression were evaluated in terms of motor function with the modification of Tarlov's classification. The motor function score was three points, and the rabbits were divided into two groups: (1) decompression group(n = 15): The screw was taken out for decompression. The acute spinal cord injury was found in one rabbit, and the motor function score with modification of Tarlov decreased to one point. It was excluded from the experiment. (2) compression group (n = 6): The decompression was not performed. Another 6 healthy white rabbits without neurological dysfunction were used as normal control group. The expressions of apoptosis relating genes bcl-2 and bax and the apoptosis of the spinal cord were observed on days 1, 7, 15, 30 and 60 after decompression. Results: The apoptosis was decreased gradually after decompression. The positive cells of bcl-2 and bax were decreased on the first day after decompression compared with those before decompression. The positive cells of bcl-2 were obviously increased and decreased in bax on the 7th day after decompression. The positive cells of bcl-2 and bax were decreased gradually on days 15, 30 and 60 after decompression. The expression of the positive cells of bcl-2 and bax were the same as that in the normal control group on the 60th day after decompression. Conclusion: The spinal cord decompression can effectively inhibit the apoptosis of nerve cells.
