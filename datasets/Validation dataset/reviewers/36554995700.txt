27944487201	Complex temperature field reconstruction algorithm compensating for the refraction effect of acoustic wave paths	When reconstructing furnace flame temperature field using acoustic pyrometry, the refraction effect of acoustic wave transmitting paths is the main cause of error in temperature field reconstruction. Based on the least-square algorithm and Fermat's theory, this paper researches the influence of the refraction effect of acoustic wave transmitting paths on reconstruction of a flame temperature field. A reconstruction algorithm is proposed that can compensate for the refraction effect of acoustic wave transmitting paths simultaneously. Experiments evaluate reconstructions of different flame temperature fields. They indicate that this algorithm can not only compensate for the refraction of acoustic wave paths, but also realize the reconstruction of a flame temperature field simultaneously. It has a comparatively high reconstruction accuracy.

In the communication layer, a timeout strategy, which used adaptively the connection-oriented and connectionless message service according to the current state of agent itself and network, was proposed to support reliable communication and reduce the influence of communication failures on the exception handling in CSCD. And according to coordination theory, communication primitive of agent communication language was extended and the state transition of exception handling based on multi-agent was described by using OOPN (object oriented Petri nets) to verify the validity of the primitives. In the application layer, combining the technologies of workflow and client/server, the inner framework of the server and client of CSCD based on multi-agent was defined by using OOPN according to the procedure of agent information processing to verify the dynamic behavior of this multi-agent system, the access control ability of the established model for handling multi-instance and multi-thread, and the mechanism of the online and off-line exception handling.

34547276752	Optimal deadlock avoidance Petri net supervisors for automated manufacturing systems	Deadlock avoidance problems are investigated for automated manufacturing systems with flexible routings. Based on the Petri net models of the systems, this paper proposes, for the first time, the concept of perfect maximal resource-transition circuits and their saturated states. The concept facilitates the development of system liveness characterization and deadlock avoidance Petri net supervisors. Deadlock is characterized as some perfect maximal resource-transition circuits reaching their saturated states. For a large class of manufacturing systems, which do not contain center resources, the optimal deadlock avoidance Petri net supervisors are presented. For a general manufacturing system, a method is proposed for reducing the system Petri net model so that the reduced model does not contain center resources and, hence, has optimal deadlock avoidance Petri net supervisor. The controlled reduced Petri net model can then be used as the liveness supervisor of the system. © 2007 Editorial Board of Control Theory & Applications.

Based on its Petri-net model, this paper addresses the deadlock-avoidance problem in AMSs, which can be modeled by systems of simple sequential processes with resources. First, deadlock is characterized as a perfect resource-transition circuit that is saturated at a reachable state. Second, for AMSs that do not have one-unit resources shared by two or more perfect resource-transition circuits that do not contain each other, it is proved that there are only two kinds of reachable states: safe states and deadlock. An algorithm for determining the safety of a new state resulting from a safe one is then presented, which has polynomial complexity. Hence, the optimal DAP with polynomial complexity can be obtained by a one-step look-ahead method, and the deadlock-avoidance problem is polynomially solved with Petri nets for the first time. Finally, by reducing a Petri-net model and applying the design of optimal DAP to the reduced one, a suboptimal DAP for a general AMS is synthesized, and its computation is of polynomial complexity. © 2008 IEEE.

Modeling leaf color dynamics in plant is of significant importance for realizing virtual plant growth. Using systematic analysis method and dynamic modeling technology, a SPAD-based leaf color dynamic model was developed to simulate time-course change characters of leaf SPAD on the plant. In addition, process of plant growth can be computer-stimulated using Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) to establish a vivid and visible model, including shooting, rooting, blooming, as well as growth of the stems and leaves. In the resistance environment, e.g., lacking of water, air or nutrient substances, high salt or alkaline, freezing injury, high temperature, suffering from diseases and insect pests, the changes from the level of whole plant to organs, tissues and cells could be computer-stimulated. Changes from physiological and biochemistry could also be described. When a series of indexes were input by the costumers, direct view and microcosmic changes could be shown. Thus, the model has a good performance in predicting growth condition of the plant, laying a foundation for further constructing virtual plant growth system.

In one-shot game, selfish and rational CRs greedily full spread their own spectrum space in order to maximize their own rates, which leads to Nash Equilibrium (N. E.). But with long term interaction, i. e., Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), CRs can come to cooperate and acquire the social optimal point by using different evolutionary strategies such as Tit For Tat (TFT), Generous TFT (GTFT), etc. Also we compare the performances of the different evolutionary strategies in noise-free and noisy environments for two-player games.

The response time and stability are two major factors which decide the performance of PC. The internal structure and operation of voltage-controlled polarization controller was analyzed in theory. An experiment based on digital signal processor (DSP) controlled circuit was designed and implemented. To test the controlling performance of PC, voltages are applied to only one plate and then three plates separately, the obtained output states of polarization (SOP) agreed well with the theoretical results. Then the amplitude of applied voltages is changed within a certain range, and a linear dependence between the response time and applied voltages was experimentally demonstrated. Consequently, the response time of PC could be estimated by the voltages applied on it. Comparing with that controlled by computers, it shows that PC controlled by DSP is characterized by shortened response time, less space-taking, as well as more favorable to integration and practical application.

They are related to the liveness property of Petri net models and thus used to characterize and avoid deadlocks. Based on them, there are two kinds of methods for developing deadlock controllers. Such methods rely on the computation of all maximal perfect RTCs and strict minimal siphons (SMSs), respectively. This paper concentrates on a class of Petri nets called a system of simple sequential processes with resources, establishes the relation between two kinds of control methods, and identifies maximal perfect RTCs and SMSs. A graph-based technique is used to find all elementary RTC structures. They are then used to derive all RTCs. Next, an iterative method is developed to recursively construct all maximal perfect RTCs from elementary ones. Finally, a one-to-one correspondence between SMSs and maximal perfect RTCs and, hence, an equivalence between two deadlock control methods are established. © 2006 IEEE.

And the correct finite element model built with some appropriate methods is used for modal analysis. The modeling method of the AMB and their effect on the rotor system are explored. A set of measured controller parameters combined with the calculation method for the actual structure and stiffness-damping of the AMB are used to calculate the stiffness and damping coefficients of the AMB. By using these as input parameters, the first eight critical speeds and mode shapes of the rotor system are obtained through ANSYS modal analysis. Each of the first six critical speeds is far lower than the operating speed of the system, corresponding to the vibration modes of torsion, axial translation and rigid swing respectively. The other two critical speeds are close to the operating speed of the system, corresponding to the 1st bending vibration. The calculation results show that the rotor cannot run stably at the scheduled operating speed under the existing structure and parameter conditions, and the design needs improving. It is known from the analysis of the calculation result that the axial active magnetic bearing has certain effect on the dynamic characteristics of the rotor and it should not be ignored in some cases. The theoretical calculation results are basically in accordance with the experimental results. This research provides a theoretical basis for the rotor system design.

79953279148	Generation of 50 stable frequency-locked optical carriers for Tb/s multicarrier optical transmission using a recirculating frequency shifter	We report the generation of fifty 12.5-GHz-spaced optical carriers with high power flatness and stability by using a single-side band (SSB) modulator-based recirculating frequency shifter (RFS). The peak-to-peak power difference and the RMS power difference of the generated carriers are 2.5 and 0.3 dB, respectively. We also experimentally investigate the impact of implementation imperfections on the flatness of the generated carriers. The important factors that contribute to the flatness of the generated carriers are found to be the amplitude balance of two inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) drive signals for the SSB modulator, the time misalignment between the I and Q signals, the accuracy of the π/2 phase bias of the SSB modulator and the stability of the polarization alignment in the RFS. By carefully controlling all the factors mentioned earlier, we obtain stable operation of 50 frequency-locked carriers; showing that the SSB modulator-based RFS is a promising technique for future terabit per second multicarrier transmission. © 2011 IEEE.

Thus one of the primary problems in the implementation of multihop transmission is how to foster cooperation among selfish nodes. Existing researches mainly adopt price and monetary stimulating. We propose instead a self-enforcing incentive scheme free of monetary remunerating for asymmetric cellar network. The incentive comprises double compensation, namely, global stimulating policy among coalitions (Inter-BEA) and local allocating rule within each coalition (Intra-BEA). We validate effectiveness of the proposed BEA scheme based on coalition game theory. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation show that our techniques can provide enough motivation for nodes to relay for own profits, and thus enlarge system coverage. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Most researchers are only concerned about the learner's cognitive and construct a great amount of substantive digital learning resources, however they neglect of the learners' affect in current e-learning systems. In this paper, we focus primarily on the negative affect of learners, and propose an emotion compensation mechanism associated with trust and personality traits in traditional recommender technology. First, we analyze the difference between emotion compensation and traditional recommender. Next, the score of trust is calculated with historical behavior; otherwise depend on similarity of personality traits without historical experience. We use trustworthiness to replace similarity as prediction weight in trust filtering process. At last we do experiments with data collected in previous system named emotion-chatting. Compared with results of experiments between traditional recommender and trust-personality recommender, the average of accuracy is improved 4 points in percentage. © 2011 IEEE.

We formulate this as a Nash equilibrium problem where each CR tries to maximize its own utility by choosing appropriate wave-form.

82155173156	An overlay multicast protocol for live streaming and delay-guaranteed interactive media	In many collaborative multimedia applications, there is often a requirement for simultaneously supporting live streaming and shareable interaction. A major challenge in designing such an application by overlay multicast is how to simultaneously provide scalable live streaming and delay-guaranteed interactive media. Live streaming by overlay multicast incurs additional application-layer latency, which conflicts with the delay-sensitive property of interactive media. To handle this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a layered degree-constrained overlay multicast protocol, which organizes the overlay multicast tree as a layered degree-constrained core tree and an extended tree. The core tree maintains available resources in its top layers for subsequent two-way interaction, whereas the extended tree expands the core tree for one-way live streaming. Our simulation and experimental results show that the proposed overlay multicast protocol can simultaneously provide delay-guaranteed interactive media as well as scalable live streaming. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we propose a novel spectrum sharing based on our improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) in a non-cooperative game for CR network. We improved the original QGA by quantum crossover operator, in order to overcome the shortcoming of the original QGA easily falling into a local extremum when used to optimize the continuous functions with many extrema. We used our improved QGA as a competitive strategy and conducted several simulations in two-user system and multi-user system. From simulation results, it is evident that the proposed improved QGA based spectrum sharing scheme has better convergence rate and higher sum capacity than GA based scheme even in multi-user CR system, namely up to 2bit/s/Hz increase in capacity. The simulation results also show that the population size of QGA affect sum capacity of cognitive radio system. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and the applicability of QGA in spectrum sharing in multi-user cognitive radio system. © 2011 IEEE.

84867570478	An optimized approach for storing and accessing small files on cloud storage	Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) is widely adopted to support Internet services. Unfortunately, native HDFS does not perform well for large numbers but small size files, which has attracted significant attention. This paper firstly analyzes and points out the reasons of small file problem of HDFS: (1) large numbers of small files impose heavy burden on NameNode of HDFS; (2) correlations between small files are not considered for data placement; and (3) no optimization mechanism, such as prefetching, is provided to improve I/O performance. Secondly, in the context of HDFS, the clear cut-off point between large and small files is determined through experimentation, which helps determine 'how small is small'. Thirdly, according to file correlation features, files are classified into three types: structurally-related files, logically-related files, and independent files. Finally, based on the above three steps, an optimized approach is designed to improve the storage and access efficiencies of small files on HDFS. File merging and prefetching scheme is applied for structurally-related small files, while file grouping and prefetching scheme is used for managing logically-related small files. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes effectively improve the storage and access efficiencies of small files, compared with native HDFS and a Hadoop file archiving facility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
