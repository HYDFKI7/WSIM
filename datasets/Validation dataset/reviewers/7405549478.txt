84927969138	Computational Analysis of Thermal Process of a Regenerative Aluminum Melting Furnace	To understand melting behavior of a regenerative aluminum melting furnace, a computational fluid dynamics based on process model was developed and integrated with user-developed melting model, oxide loss model, burner reversing and burning capacity model. Simulations of melting process were made to model the flow and thermal phenomena in such a furnace. The rules of thermal process on melting behavior are obtained: Aluminum temperature increases slowly with melting time in solid-liquid zone, but rises faster when leaving solid-liquid phase lines. Furnace temperature first increases with melting time, then stepwise decreases, lastly periodically increases. Oxide weight parabolically increases with melting time. Aluminum temperature parabolically increases with oxide thickness. In early melting stage, flue gas temperature reduces with liquid fraction, yet in later melting stage increases. Oxygen concentration in flue gas increases with liquid fraction in early melting stage yet remains constant in later melting stage.

84927970934	A CFD-PBM Coupled Model Predicting Anodic Bubble Size Distribution in Aluminum Reduction Cells	In order to understand more details of anodic bubble formation, coalescence and movement mechanism under the horizontal anode bottom, a population balance model (PBM) was used to calculate the anodic bubble size distribution (BSD) in aluminum reduction cells. The proposed PBM was numerically solved with a class method (CM) which has been provided in ANSYS FLUENT. A CFD-PBM coupled model that combines the PBM and CFD model was used to simulate more complex flow behavior with proper coalescence and breakage mechanism of anodic bubble. A modified k-e turbulence model was used to describe liquid phase turbulence in the simulation. The effects of current density, anode width and the presence of slots on the BSD have been investigated. In addition, the relative influence of the bath flow induced by the cell magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) on the BSD is also discussed. The predicted BSD is in accordance with a series of literature experimental results.

18344374243	Numerical simulation of fluid flow and optimization on structure of air-agitated seed precipitation tank	Air-agitated seed precipitation tank is a key facility for the industrial production of alumina and there exist many defects, such as scaling, liquid short-circuiting and so on. In order to overcome these defects, three-dimensional flow field in the tank with different structures is calculated numerically using CFD software. Euler/Euler approach is used to study the effect of structure on the flow field in the tank. Two-fluid model and multi-block gird are adopted in the simulation. The results discussed in this paper are well consistent with the practical situations. The flow field is improved obviously and the rate of scaling is reduced in the optimized tank.

20144368792	Numerical simulation of flow field and optimization of structure parameters of seed precipitation tank for production of alumina	In order to overcome the defects of air-agitated seed precipitation, such as scaring, liquid short-circuiting, the three-dimension flow fields with different structure are numerically simulated by computational fluid dynamics software. Euler/Euler approach was used to study the effects of structure on the flow field in the tank. Multi-fluid model, body-fitted coordinates and multi-block gird were adopted in the simulation. The simulating results are well consonant with the practical situations. The flow field is improved obviously when the flow velocity increases from 0.089 m/s to 0.192-0.300 m/s at the bottom of the optimized tank and therefore the scaring is reduced greatly in the industrial production. With a gathering sill, the problem of short-circuiting, which always appears in the upper of the tank, can be solved very well.

0030384629	Heat transfer in the solidification and melting processes of metallic materials and its application to the determination of thermal conduction	Heat transfer at the interface during liquid/solid phase transformation is discussed. The need for realistic data for thermal conductivity is pointed out. Based on an analysis of the heat balance over the interface, a method is described that is suitable for the determination of thermal conductivity of the solid as well as the liquid phase while the phase transformation takes place. By the measurements a one-dimensional motion of a freezing or melting front is established in the specimen. The technique allows the study of alternative situations, the propagation of the phase transition interface, resp. the quasi-equilibrium state where the interface is stationary. The position of the interface is determined from the measurement of the electrical resistance over the specimen including the interface. The resistance over time obtained during the melting/freezing processes, enables the determination of the speed of the solid-liquid interface. The thermal conductivity of the specimen at the interface can be evaluated from the speed by which the interface propagates, the temperature gradients normal to the interface, and thermal properties. The measuring technique incorporates a simultaneous determination of electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity at the interface. The Wiedemann-Franz law can therefore be a reference for the results. The paper refers to measurements on Wood's metal and gallium. The results confirm the potential of the method by analysis of the heat transfer mechanisms by a solid/liquid phase transformation.

23844551905	CFD prediction of cold airflow field for multi-air channel pulverized coal burner in rotary kiln	This paper presents a 3-D numerical study with CFX - 4.3 software on airflow field of a four-air channel coal burner in alumina clinker rotary kiln. The main objective of this work is to investigate the effects of the geometric parameters and operation parameters of the burner on airflow field, which provides reference for simulation of temperature distribution, and for optimal design and operation of the multi-air channel coal burner. A thermal measurement was conducted on one of the alumina clinker rotary kilns in China Aluminum Corp. Henan Division, then the boundary conditions for the calculation were determined by the measuring. The results show that the central backflow is mainly dependent on the shape of exit nozzles, the velocity of each airflow, while the external backflow and entrainment rate are mainly dependent on the velocity of external flow, the outlet nozzle mode of outer channel and the ratio of internal flow to external flow. Calculation also shows that the structure of whirl vane has an effect on central backflow and entrainment rate. Â© 2002 IEEE.

2942752367	Test measurements and error analysis of thermo-physical properties of phase-change materials at a phase-transition point temperature	The moving phase-interface curves during a solid-liquid phase-transition process are closely related with such a variety of two-phase thermo-physical properties as specific heat, density, thermal conductivity and phase-transition latent heat. The authors have come up with a method for determining several thermo-physical parameters, among others, the thermal conductivity of phase-change materials at a solid-liquid phase transition temperature. The above determination was carried out through the measurement of phase-interface moving rates. A test measurement device was designed and a quantitative analysis of measurement errors performed of the test measurement system. It was found that the error of the measurement system based on a combination of numerical calculations and experimental tests would not exceed 3%. The thermal conductivity and thermal diffusion factor of several kinds of materials were measured by using the above-mentioned test measurement system with satisfactory results being obtained. This shows that the measurement method proposed by the authors is trustworthy.

33744747020	CFD prediction of physical field for multi-air channel pulverized coal burner in rotary kiln	A 3-D numerical simulation with CFX software on physical field of multi-air channel coal burner in rotary kiln was carried out. The effects of various operational and structural parameters on flame feature and temperature distribution were investigated. A thermal measurement was conducted on a rotary kiln (4.5 m in diameter, 90 m in length) with four-air channel coal burner to determine the boundary conditions and to verify the simulation results. The calculation result shows that the distribution of velocity near burner exit is saddle-like; recirculation zones near nozzle and wall are useful for mixture primary air with coal and high temperature fume. A little central airflow can avoid coal backing up and cool nozzle. Adjusting the ratio of internal airflow to outer airflow is an effective and major means to regulate flame and temperature distribution in sintering region. Large whirl cone angle can intensify distribution range at flame root to accelerate ignition and mixture. Large coal size can reduce high temperature region and result in coal combusting insufficiently. Too much combustion air will lengthen flame and increase heat loss.

33745307770	An experimental technique for liquid/solid thermal conductivity measurements at the melting point	Based upon the theory that the thermal conductivity can be determined by measuring the speed of the propagation of the solid/liquid phase interface during a phase transition, a system was developed to investigate the thermal conductivity of metals and alloys at the liquid/solid phase transformation point. Furthermore, a mathematical method was applied to represent the melting and solidifying process in the phase transformation chamber, by which the error could be analyzed. In order to test the feasibility of the method and the measuring system, a series of verification experiments on lead have been performed to estimate the precision and the applicability of the measuring system. From comparisons with recommended data from the literature, the uncertainty of the experimental results is estimated to be about 5% which means the measuring method is suitable to determine the thermal conductivity of eutectic alloys and metals at the liquid/solid phase transformation point. This work provides a relatively precise method for thermal conductivity measurements on new materials such as lead-free solders. Â© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

33750236600	Mechanism of cutoff frequency of resonator tube in thermoacoustic engine	Based on waveguide theory method, the cutoff frequency of a resonator tube in the thermoacoustic engine was investigated. A calculating model was established. Computation of the cutoff frequency of the circle and rectangular waveguide with the same equivalent radius was carried out, and the computation results were compared. The results show that the cutoff frequency of the rectangular waveguide tube with the same equivalent radius is far greater than that of the cylindrical tube. For thermoacoustic resonator with the equivalent radius of 2 mm, the work frequency of 5500 Hz is far smaller than the cutoff frequency of 50248 Hz at the sound velocity of 343 m/s, so only one dimension plane wave can be spreaded in the cavity of the thermoacoustic resonator. Calculating and analyzing results show that cutoff frequency method is an effective approach for the prediction frequency range of one dimension plane wave in thermoacoustic resonator.

33846239686	Application of Hilbert-Huang transform to denoising in vortex flowmeter	Due to piping vibration, fluid pulsation and other environmental disturbances, variations of amplitude and frequency to the raw signals of vortex flowmeter are imposed. It is difficult to extract vortex frequencies which indicate volumetric flowrate from noisy data, especially at low flowrates. Hilbert-Huang transform was adopted to estimate vortex frequency. The noisy raw signal was decomposed into different intrinsic modes by empirical mode decomposition, the time-frequency characteristics of each mode were analyzed, and the vortex frequency was obtained by calculating partial mode's instantaneous frequency. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate the vortex frequency with less than 2% relative error; and in the low flowrate range studied, the denoising ability of Hilbert-Huang transform is markedly better than Fourier based algorithms. These findings reveal that this method is accurate for vortex signal processing and at the same time has strong anti-disturbance ability.

33846262081	Analysis of disagreement between numerically predicted and experimental heat transfer data of impinging jet	The method of numerical simulation was applied to investigate the effects of jet impinging plate thickness and its thermal conductivity on the local heat flux distribution along the impinging plate. The results show that the two factors have great effects on the heat flux distribution. The non-uniformity of the local heat-flux on the impinging plate surface gets more profound as the plate becomes thicker and thermal conductivity gets larger. When Reynolds number is 5000, the ratio of nozzle-to-plate spacing to nozzle diameter is 5 and thermal conductivity is 16 W/(mÂ·K), and even for the plate with only 25 Î¼m in thickness, the non-uniformity of the heat flux cannot be neglected. When the plate thickness is 50 Î¼m, only when thermal conductivity is as small as 1 W/(mÂ·K), the heat flux curve can be approximately treated as an iso-heat-flux boundary. In the experimental research, a real non-iso-heat-flux boundary is treated as an iso-heat-flux boundary, which would result in under-estimated Nusselt number value in the stagnation zone and an over-estimated value outside. Such an experimental Nusselt number distribution is taken to evaluate turbulent model, and the conclusion would be drawn that the turbulent model over-predicts the stagnation heat transfer. This is one of the important reasons why many literatures reported that k-Îµ turbulent model dramatically over-predicts the impinging jet heat transfer in the stagnation region.

Influence of air horn and mounting angle	Used in working situations, extra errors are inevitably added to the measurement results of a Pilot tube due to deviations from its standard usage conditions. Aiming at investigating how the air horn and mounting angle affect a Pitot tube measurement, experiments were carried out on various Pitot tubes.

Secondly, the extra errors were Â±2% when the mounting angle ranged from -10Â° to 10Â°. Thirdly, the measured values of an air horn with smaller diameter were hardly affected by the flow velocity even if there existed non-zero mounting angles.

35348930990	Experimental and numerical simulation study of heat transfer due to confined impinging circular jet	An experimental and numerical simulation study of heat transfer due to a confined impinging circular jet is presented. In this research, a stainless steel foil heated disk was used as the heat transfer surface of a simulated chip, and the thermocouples were mounted symmetrically along the diameter of the foil to measure the temperature distribution on the surface. Driven by a small pump, a circular air jet (1.5 mm and 1 mm in diameter) impinged on the heat-transfer surface with middle and low Reynolds numbers. The parameters, such as Reynolds number and ratio of height-to-diameter, were changed to investigate the radial distribution of the Nusselt number and the characteristics of heat transfer in the stagnation region. Numerical computations were performed by using several different turbulence models. In wall bounded turbulent flows, near-wall modeling is crucial. Therefore, the turbulence models enhanced wall treatment, such as the RNG Îº-Îµ model, may be superior for modeling impingement flows. The numerical results showed reasonable agreement with the experimental data for local heat transfer coefficient distributions. The impinging jet may be an effective method to solve the cooling problem of high power density electronic packaging. Â© 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

34247593737	Investigation of the pressure probe properties as the sensor in the vortex flowmeter	Poor anti-disturbance ability to piping vibrations is one of the most difficult problems in vortex flowmeters which have been widely used in many industrial fields. Duct-wall differential pressure method (DDPM) proposed by the author's previous work is proved to be an effective measure to reduce these interferences. In order to improve the performance of DDPM, the relationship between pressure-sampling tube's natural frequency and its geometrical parameters was derived by theoretical modeling, and the influences of different pressure-sampling positions, pressure-sampling tubes, duct diameters and bluff body shapes on the performance of DDPM-based vortex flowmeter were compared and discussed experimentally. One important feature found is that the pressure-sampling system hardly affects the measurment of signal frequencies in DDPM but it has great impact on the signal amplitudes. Measures to reduce the distortion of signal amplitudes include increasing the natural frequency of pressure-sampling system, choosing symmetric sampling tubes and selecting their parameters according to specific measurement conditions, etc. It is also found that despite of duct diameter and bluff body shape, the amplitudes of duct-wall differential pressures in DDPM fall and keep nearly a finite constant after they reach the peak values, which may reduce the requirement of signal amplifiers. These properties of the pressure sensor are useful to improve the design of DDPM-based vortex flowmeters in flow measurement and at the same time give an in-depth understanding about the measurement of differential pressures.

The effects of different switching modes on injection entrancement of multi burners, combustion and billet heating process in furnace were analyzed numerically, and the computational results were compared with on-site measurement, which verified the practicability of this numerical simulation system. The results indicate that the flow pattern and distribution of temperature in regenerative reheating furnace with partial same-side-switching combustion mode are favorable to satisfy the high quality requirements of reheating, in which the terminal heating temperature of billets is more than 1 460 K and the temperature difference between two nodes is not more than 10 K. But since the surface average temperature of billets apart from heating zone is only about 1 350 K and continued heating is needed in soaking zone, the design and operation of current state are still needed to be optimized to improve the temperature schedule of billet heating. The distribution of velocity and temperature in regenerative reheating furnace with same-side-switching combustion mode cannot satisfy the even and fast heating process. The terminal heating temperature of billets is lower than that of the former case by 30 K. The distribution of flow and temperature can be improved by using cross-switching combustion mode, whose terminal temperature of billets is about 1 470 K with small temperature difference within 10 K.

According to the deviation of the stability index from the steady state, the stability of gas-liquid two-phase vortex street in conduits was identified quantitatively. Experiments were performed in horizontal and vertical conduits with diameter of 50 mm respectively, adopting air and water as flow media and a triangular prism as the vortex-forming body. The effects of Reynolds number and volume void fraction on the stability of gas-liquid two-phase vortex street were analyzed. The results show that the volume void fraction has the primary influence on the vortex street's stability. In the horizontal conduit experiments, when the volume void fraction is less than 15%, the vortex streets are quite steady and their stability indexes are 1.00Â±0.16, while when the volume void fraction is more than 15%, steady vortex streets are difficult to occur and the stability indexes of partial vortex streets are within 2.0-3.0. In the vertical conduit experiments, volume void fraction of steady vortex streets can be maintained up to 22%, and the stability indexes in this range are 1.00Â±0.12, while when the volume void fraction is more than 22%, the vortex street becomes unstable and the stability indexes of partial vortex streets are 0.50-0.75.

An analytical model of parallel TEG was developed by theoretical analysis and calculation, based on thermodynamics theory, semiconductor thermoelectric theory and law of conservation of energy. Approximate expressions of output power and current of parallel TEG were deduced by the analytical model. An experimental system was built to verify the model. The results indicate that only when all of the thermoelectric modules (TE modules) in the parallel TEG have the same inherent parameters and working conditions, the parallel properties of the TEG are the same as that of common DC power. The existence of contact resistance is just like the increase of the TE module's internal resistance, which leads to the deceases of output power. The thermal contact resistance reduces the output power by reducing the temperature difference between the two sides of the thermocouples. The results derived from the model are basically consistent with the experimental results, the model is suitable for the performance researching and designing of parallel TEG. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Although with simple boundary conditions, impinging jet is characterized with many complicated flow features, it is almost impossible to obtain analytical flow and heat transfer solution. As to numerical simulation, one severe obstacle is to find a proper turbulent model, because impinging jet simulation result is strongly dependent on the turbulent model adopted. So experiment becomes the most important tool to investigate the heat transfer of impinging jet. In order to obtain the heat transfer coefficient distribution of impinging surface, iso-heat-flux boundary condition was often adopted by former investigators. But ideal iso-heat-flux boundary condition is hard to realize because of the limit of material and manufacturing technology. Impinging jet with nonideal iso-heat-flux boundary condition was modeled by numerical simulation, with standard k-Îµ model as turbulent model, regardless of its strict accuracy on impinging jet. The actual heat transfer coefficient was compared with the calculated result which is based on the hypothesis of ideal iso-heat-flux boundary condition. The influence of nonideal iso-heat-flux boundary condition on calculated results was analyzed. The criterion of judging approximate ideal iso-heat-flux boundary condition is put forward which could be used as guidance for designing impinging surface in impinging jet heat transfer experiment. It can also be used to evaluate the validity of experimental results. Further more, the conclusion of this paper can also be applied to other heat transfer experiments with nonuniform heat transfer coefficient.

42749107161	Experimental research on heat transfer of confined air jet impingement with tiny size round nozzle in high density electronics packaging model	As the heat generation density of electronics packaging grow fast during recent years, the problem of heat dissipation of electronics become the obstruction of development of electronic packaging industry, which accelerated the research and development of heat transfer on the direction of microcosmic. In this research, an epoxy resin laminate heated by heating element was used as the heat transfer surface of simulated chip, and the thermocouples were mounted symmetrically along the diagonal of the laminate to measure the temperature distribution of the surface. Air jet, driven by a small pump, comes from round nozzles (1.5mm and 1mm in diameter) and impinges on the heat transfer surface with middle and low Reynolds number. The parameters such as Reynolds number and height-to-diameter ratio was changed to investigate the radial distribution of Nusselt number and the characteristics of heat transfer in stagnant section. This experimental research will give useful information for the application of air jet impingement to the cooling of electronics packaging.

51449111025	The effect of temperature on low cycle fatigue of an eutectic solder	Low cycle fatigue tests of eutectic solder alloy 63Sn37Pb were carried out over a wide range of temperatures(from 22Â°C to 125Â°C), and at each fixed temperature, different total strain ranges(from 1% to 10%) were loaded. The triangular waveform was employed for all the tests, and hysteresis loops data were automatically collected by data acquisition system. Relations between the maximum tensile load and number of cycle, and the load drop parameters under each test condition were calculated to describe the softening behavior of solder. Logarithmic values of cyclic stress and plastic strain range at half of the fatigue life were linearly fitted for each temperature. With different definitions of fatigue life, relationships between plastic strain range and low cycle fatigue life at different temperature were presented in Coffin-Manson model. At low temperature, the curve of load drop parameter has a flat slope which indicates a slow softening of the solder alloy, and the slope becomes steeper as temperature increases. The curve of maximum tensile load versus number of cycle has approximately the same trend as the load drop parameter curve. As temperature increases, the slope of the cyclic stress and strain plot increases, namely the cyclic strain hardening exponent becomes larger. It is also found that the fatigue exponent m in Coffin-Manson model only decreases slightly with increasing temperature, but the ductility coefficient C decreases evidently as temperature increases. Finally, the Coffin-Manson model is modified so that the temperature effect is included. Â©2006 IEEE.

51449121843	Study on compulsive cooling of straight impinging jet array and swirling jet impingement	Impinging jet is one of the ideal schemes to satisfy the heat dissipation requirement of the high power chips. In this research, experiments are carried out to investigate the heat transfer between the straight impinging jet array and an iso-heat-flux simulant chip (a heated epoxy resin plate). In the heat transfer experiments, two kinds of jet array are considered, the circular array and the foursquare array. In some range of flux of the air jet and nozzle-to-plate spacing, the influence of the different arrangement of the spout on average heat transfer of the target plate is discussed. Furthermore, the heat transfer effect of the jet array is compared to the single orifice nozzle which has the same flow area with the array nozzle. Meanwhile, numerical simulation is performed to study the heat transfer effect of the swirling impinging jet in this paper. The angular velocity of the swirling jet, the flow Reynolds number, the dimension of the nozzle and the nozzle-to-plate spacings are examined, then the distribution of both local and average heat transfer coefficient (Nusselt number) on the simulant chip is obtained.

Coke desulfurization during calcination is discussed in this paper. Influences of calcination temperature, holding time and coke granularity on coke desulfurization were discussed. Experimental results show that calcination temperature has a remarkable influence on coke desulfurization. When the temperature is high enough desulfurization ratio of coke can reach 85% only by calcination. Holding time has a definite influence on coke desulfurization, but desulfurization ratio is low at the temperature of 900-1300Â°C. The influence of holding time is obvious when calcination temperature surpasses 1400Â°C. The influence of coke granularity is smaller compared with calcination temperature and holding time.

65649087460	Spectral analysis of cell voltage fluctuation in 320 kA pre-baked aluminum reduction cells	An awful lot of data of cell voltage fluctuation under typical working conditions were collected, and a method based on fast Fourier transform (FFT) and power spectral density (PSD) estimation was put forward to extract the spectral characteristics of cell voltage. Parametric methods were employed in PSD estimation. Spectral analysis was also compared with wavelet packet analysis. The results reveal that spectra obtained by different parametric methods are similar. The spectra of normal cells' voltage have only one noticeable lobe due to fluctuation of molten alumina at anodes, while spectra of other abnormal cells have one mainlobe and one sidelobe. In cells with carbon in bath the spectral mainlobe of cell voltage is still due to the fluctuation of molten alumina at anodes and the sidelobe is due to the fluctuation of carbon in bath; in cells with metal pad wave, the spectral mainlobe is due to metal pad waving and the sidelobe is still due to the fluctuation of molten alumina at anodes. Compared with wavelet packet analysis, spectral analysis is simpler and takes less time in calculation, which is a big merit in the large-scale application of online diagnosis systems of working conditions in aluminum reduction cells.

66349123935	Thermal comfort in waiting room at railway station in cold region in China	A field study and analysis about the thermal comfort was carried out in the waiting room at Beijing West Rail Station in Chinese cold region. Passengers' TSV (thermal sense vote) was obtained using statistical method on the basis of more than 1200 questionnaires. The linear regression between TSV and indoor temperature indicates that thermal neutral temperature is 25.2Â°C. According to the percentage of satisfaction among all passengers under different indoor temperatures, the acceptable temperature range in the waiting room is 24.2-30.2Â°C. It is also found that passengers' temporary stay should be taken into consideration for the thermal comfort analysis. Passengers' TSV is not a constant value after they enter the waiting room. In fact, ÎTSV increases as passengers are waiting for the train, and the growing rate is dependent on indoor-outdoor temperature difference. The greater the temperature difference, the faster ÎTSV increases. At last, a linear regression between indoor comfortable temperature and outdoor temperature was generated as the adaptive comfort model.

In the meantime, the briquette, coke and anthracite block coal sample were compared with each other at a temperature rising speed of 5 Â°C/min. The combustion rate of a single particle of the briquette was investigated by employing a muffle furnace. It has been found that the briquette coal combustion process experiences four stages, i.e. drying and preheating, volatile element precipitation, carbon particle combustion and carbon residue burn-out. With an increase of the temperature rising speed, the reaction time required by various combustion stages of the briquette was shortened and the reaction rate was speeded up. When the temperature rising speed increases from 5 Â°C/min to 10 Â°C/min and 15 Â°C/min, the briquette ignition time will be shortened from 28.12 min to 14.01 min and 10.13 min while the burn-out time will also be reduced from 36.82 min to 27.59 min and 22.47 min.

Experiments were conducted to obtain the static pressure at certain cross-sections of a fine powder pneumatic conveying pipeline with a length of 26. m and an inner diameter of 53. mm. The conveyed material was flyash with a mean particle size of 30 Î¼m and the solids loading ratio was in the range 20-70. A numerical study of gas-solid flow in complex three-dimensional systems was undertaken by means of commercial CFD software Fluent 6.3. The simulation was performed using the Euler-Euler approach, accounting for four-way coupling. The calculated results of pressure gradient were found to be in good agreement with the measured data, with a fitting slope of 0.781 for the first horizontal straight pipeline and 1.017 for horizontal bend. It was also found that the pressure gradients increase with increase in particle diameter rapidly and reach the peak value when particle diameter is 150 Î¼m, and then begin to decrease and show a slight steepening with increase in particle diameter with a value greater than 150Î¼m. An increase in particle density results in increase in pressure gradient. The pressure drop is much smaller when the roughness height is zero. The pressure gradient over the horizontal bend increases gradually with the increase of roughness height. The larger the roughness constant is defined, the greater the pressure drop will be. The bend pressure gradient decreases significantly when the bend radius ratio increases from 1 to 3, and then much slowly for bend radius ratios 3-6. With the increase of velocity difference, the pressure drop decrease is different at first, after 0.2-0.3. m, the pressure reduces the same. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The Gorbatchev integral formulae and a dynamic model for primary reactions were used to seek solutions to the activation energy and frequency factor of the coal, during which the solutions are in relatively good agreement with the dynamic curves. When the coal ranks consisting of the blended coal are identical, the activation energy and volatile content of the blended coal as well as its activation energy and ignition temperature assume a good linear relationship. When the blended coal is in short of any single coal rank, such linear relationships will be destroyed.

According to the two months production data obtained from a certain aluminun corporation, the loss and efficiency of the exergy were calculated. The calculation results show that the supplied exergy is mainly consumed in such unit processes as slurry sintering, aluminium trihydrate calcining, tube digestion and evaporation, which consumes about 85% of the exergy in the alumina production. The slurry sintering process has the lowest exergy efficiency of about 7%. The innovation for energy saving can be proceeded on the unit process with low exergy efficiency. It is not only effective for evaluation of enterprise utilization of energy and quality of energy loss, but also advantageous for making the best of the potential energy saving capacity of enterprise by using exergy analysis method.

80053444733	An experimental study of the effect of water content on combustion of coal tar/water emulsion droplets	Isolated high asphaltene droplets of coal tar/water emulsion were studied to investigate the non-steady behavior of the burning droplets. Data on size and temperature histories were obtained. Coke residues were analyzed by scanning electron microscope. Lower and upper limits for ignition time delay were established. The error, defined as the time lag between these two limits, was less than 8 ms. Ignition time delays of emulsions were longer than for ordinary coal tar (CT) droplets of the same size but the peak temperature of emulsions occurred much earlier. A steeper temperature rise observed in the emulsions during portions of their combustion history is evidence not only of soot reduction but also the extent of burnout of the cenospheres. The latter is an important aspect in the reduction of pollutant emissions. The emulsion droplets indicated swelling of considerable magnitude compared with that of CT. Coke particles formed from emulsions were more porous, with thinner and fragile shells. The CT residues were harder and more resistant to burning. Excess burnout time or the ratio of burnout time of the emulsions depended on the water concentration, indicating that longer oxidation time was required for coke particles from coal tar than from emulsions.

The furnace temperature and oxide mass increases with melting time periodically and parabolically, respectively. As the oxide thickness increases, the aluminum temperature increasing becomes slow with the increase of porosity.

Laminar doublediffusive mixed convection in a two-dimensional displacement ventilated enclosure with discrete heat and contaminant sources is numerically studied. Based on the governing equations, the fluid, heat, and contaminant transport processes are respectively described by the corresponding streamfunction, heatfunction, and massfunction. Attentions are given to analyze the effects of the main factors - the strength of heat source indicated by the Grashof number (Gr), the strength of contaminant source by the buoyancy ratio (Br), the strength of ventilation by the Reynolds number (Re), and the ventilation mode - on the indoor air environment. Numerical results, presented by the contour function lines, namely, streamlines, heatlines, and masslines, illustrated that the indoor air, heat and contaminant transport structures are mainly determined by the interaction between the internal buoyancy natural convection induced by the discrete heat/contaminant sources and the external forced convection driven by the mechanical ventilation. It is found that the convection transport method could explicitly disclose the complicated philosophy of indoor air environment, and thus provides a simple but practical approach to see the indoor airflow and heat and contaminant transport structures.

84863150241	Maximum thermal efficiency of condensing boiler	Since 1970s, kinds of condensing boilers (CB) have been widely applied in HVAC engineering, their exit flue gas temperature is very lower, even down to about 40Â°C-45Â°C, and their thermal efficiency is very higher, even up to about 107%-109%, based on low heat value. The application of CBs in HVAC system or hot water supply system can increase thermal efficiency and reduce the consumption of fuel, because of the utilization of latent heat of vapour in the exit flue gas. Generally, the higher the content of vapour in the exit flue gas and the lower the temperature of return or make-up water, then the lower the exit flue gas temperature of CB and the higher the thermal efficiency of CBs. And then what is the maximum value of thermal efficiency of CBs theoretically? In this paper, from the thermal equilibrium and the definition of thermal efficiency based on low heat value, the maximum value of thermal efficiency of condensing boilers that burn different typical fuels have been educed, which are respectively as follows: 107.1%(0 # diesel oil), 110.4%(natural gas), 105.2%( bituminous coal) etc, which are useful to both the design of condensing boilers in heating system and the design of HVAC engineering.

Compared the experimental results and corrective results of thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate with the values recommended in literature, the errors are less than 5%. The results of three molten salts show a significantly smaller error between the calculation and the test result after the correction than before the correction, and the thermal conductivity confirms that the error correction method significantly reduces the error from non-one-dimensional heat conduction and unstable temperature boundary conditions. The combination of dynamic measurement with the error correction can improve the accuracy of apparatus and reduce the requirements for testing devices. The reliability of the method is confirmed experimentally.

Current risers had an influence on the relative errors of anode current, but the maximal error was within 3%. Therefore, the non-contact measurement was applicable to online monitoring of individual anode current with different current risers and structures in aluminum reduction cell.

84885942963	Numerical simulation of gas-liquid two-phase flow in aluminum reduction cells with perforated anodes	Numerical simulation of anodic bubble/electrolyte two-phase flow in the melts of aluminum reduction cells with the Euler-Euler two-fluid model was conducted based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A modified k-Îµ turbulence model was used to describe liquid phase turbulence in the simulation, by assuming the pseudo turbulence resulted from anodic bubbles. The results of CFD simulation for traditional no-hole anodes were compared with the experimental data under similar conditions using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Good agreement was found between the CFD model and PIV measurements, which indicated that the current CFD model could be used to deal with two types of perforated anodes. The electrolyte velocity under perforated anodes could be reduced and the stability of bath flow could be maintained. Perforated anodes could make bath flow more stable. The maximum and average velocity of electrolyte in four-hole anodes were reduced by 9.53% and 12.89%, respectively. The global average bubble fraction in the melts, the local average bubble fraction in anode-cathode distance (ACD) and the thicknesses of bubble layer under the anode with perforated anodes were less than those with no-hole anodes, but the immersion depth of anodic bubbles in electrolyte was almost the same as that in the case of no-hole anodes. Both ACD and cell voltage could be lowered and energy consumption could be reduced. Â© All Rights Reserved.

Thereby, the individual anode current or anode current distribution could be obtained from the measured magnetic field values. In addition, the skeleton structure model of aluminum reduction cell was also established, which was used for verification and optimization of the method. The results show that the relative errors of the combination mode of three sensors are reduced effectively and distribute between 0.35% and 0.90%. The relative errors of the combination mode of the 13 mm spacing between sensor 1 and sensor 2 and the 5 mm spacing between sensor 1 and sensor 4 are reduced significantly and evaluated to be within Â±0.3%. The test method has characteristics of simple structure, easy operation, high precision and online continuous measurement.

84890818509	Optimization of operational parameters for flash smelting process based on orthogonal experiment	With an continuous increasing in the productivity and smelting intensity of the copper flash smelting furnace, distributions of physical fields, such as the temperature field and concentration field in the reaction shaft change significantly, and the matching scheme of operational parameters for different air flows becomes more and more important. Based on the orthogonal design method, the simulation study was carried out to investigate the effects of operational parameters of the main three air flows (i.e. the process air, the distribution air and the central oxygen) on the mixing and reaction process in the reaction shaft. The simulation results show that the distribution air velocity has more significant effect on the mixing and reaction process compared to the other two air flows. The smelting efficiency of the optimal case is further improved, of which the dust generation rate can be controlled around 3.2%, and the residual oxygen in the flue is nearly zero.

84892605048	Mathematic simulation of heat transfer and operating optimization in alumina rotary kiln	Based on the analysis of material motion in the axial direction, heat transfer and mass transport processes in a rotary kiln, and combining with pulverized coal combustion, material pyrogenation, cooling of furnace wall finally, and heat transfer and mass transport equations, the combined heat transfer mathematical model for alumina rotary kiln was built up. According to the in-site real operation parameters, the heat transfer mathematical model was solved numerically for an alumina rotary kiln to predict the temperature profiles of gas and material in the axial direction. The results show that as the excess air coefficient reduces from 1.38 to 1.20, the temperature of the sintering zone increases and the length decreases. However, as the excess air coefficient reduces from 1.20 to 1.10, the temperature of the sintering zone decreases and the length increases. When the mixed coal amount at the end of kiln is reduced from 68.6 kg/t to 62.0 kg/t and the burned coal amount at the head of kiln correspondingly increases from 155.3 kg/t to 161.9 kg/t, the sintering zone temperature increases and the length reduces. The suitable excess air coefficient and mixed coal amount at the end of kiln are recommended for the rotary kiln operation optimization.

84892630050	CFD simulation and performance analysis of CJD burner for intensified flash smelting process	The flash smelting process has been widely acknowledged as a successful modern pyro-metallurgical technology because of its good production flexibility. In past decades, great efforts have been put on the equipment improvement in order to achieve a highly intensive and efficient flash smelting process. However, along with the increasing of the productivity and the intensification of the process, technical problems such as the un-smelted materials accumulated in the settler and the dust generation ratio going higher are found occurring more frequently than before. All these problems however indicate degeneration in the performance of the central jet distributor (CJD) burner. A study was then made on the combustion and reaction processes in the flash furnace equipped with a CJD burner. A steady-state turbulent model was developed and a discrete phase model was included to investigate the velocity and temperature changes of both the gaseous and particle phases in the reaction shaft. The deviation of the numerical model is estimated to be less than 6%. The simulation results reveal a serious delay in the ignition of concentrate particles after they are fed into the furnace. Minor modification was also made by CFD computation, attempting to improve the particle ignition speed, but it was found not so effective. The main reason for the decreased smelting efficiency is found to be the poor mixing between the gaseous and particle phases under the intensified condition. These appeal for a great improvement in the performance of the CJD burner. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.

84893034550	A dynamic technique for the measurement of thermal conductivity of molten salt based on cylindrical melting model	This paper reports a dynamic testing technique for measuring the effective thermal conductivity of phase change materials close to the melting point aiming at the compensation for the absence of such data. Based on Stefan model, the time dependence of the position of the phase interface in a cylindrical melting process, which implies the thermal conductivity, was successfully determined with the aid of the perturbation method. Thereafter, a series of experiments were conducted on a well-designed testing system with excellent heat insulation to collect relevant data of sodium acetate trihydrate. To bridge the gap between the experimental and the actual values, a 3-dimensional, unsteady, numerical model, taking convection into consideration, was built on CFD code. Under necessary assumptions, this model allowed a better understanding of the role of the convection playing in the experiments. Accurate results of approximation to experimental data were obtained by continually adjusting the iterative value. The maximum deviation was limited in 9 %.

Research was carried out to investigate processes including the gas and solid flow, particle movement, drying and pyrolysis of pulverized coal and combustion of carbon residue and coke in a blast furnace with standard k-Îµ model, discrete phase model, evaporation and diffusion model, dual parallel competition model and diffusion-kinetic combustion model respectively in Fluent 6.3.

Moreover, 7 parameters were optimized by the orthogonal experiments, taking the burnout rate as the evaluation indicator. Results show that the burnout rate under the optimal condition can be increased by 110.8% comparing to that under the standard condition. The importance of parameters influencing the evaluation indicator is found in the order which is the type of the pulverized coal, the pulverized coal injection rate, the oxygen enrichment rate, the blast temperature, the spraying gun type, the blast volume and the angle.

Thermal characteristics of aluminum holding furnaces were analyzed according to cause and effect diagram. Mathematical representation of thermal characteristics was obtained by partial least squares method. The results show that oxidant type or pool depth significantly affects aluminum temperature uniform coefficient. Aluminum temperature uniform coefficient is high when air is used as oxidant. Increasing air preheated temperature, and raising natural gas velocity, aluminum temperature uniform coefficient reduces firstly during heating and holding phase, and then increases during standing phase. Aluminum temperature uniform coefficient with air-fuel ratio rises firstly during heating and holding phase, and then drops during standing phase. Aluminum temperature uniform coefficient increases as elevating vertical burner angle or pool depth.

Combined with the experimental work, validated mathematical model as well as three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was established to analyze the flow regions of feedwells on an industrial scale. The concept of RTD, although a well-known method for the characterization of mixing behavior in conventional mixers and reactors, is still a novel measure for the characterization of mixing in feedwells. Numerical simulation results show that the inlet feed rate and the aspect ratio of feedwells are the most critical parameters which affect the RTD of feedwell. Further simulation experiments were then carried out. Under the optimal operation conditions, the volume fraction of dead zone can reduce by10.8% and an increasement of mixing flow volume fraction by 6.5% is also observed. There is an optimum feed inlet rate depending on the feedwell design. The CFD model in conjunction with the RTD analysis then can be used as an effective tool in the design, evaluation and optimization of thickener feedwell in the red mud separation.

Simulations of melting process were made to model the flow and thermal phenomena in such a furnace.

Furnace temperature first increases with melting time, then stepwise decreases, lastly periodically increases. Oxide weight parabolically increases with melting time. Aluminum temperature parabolically increases with oxide thickness. In early melting stage, flue gas temperature reduces with liquid fraction, yet in later melting stage increases. Oxygen concentration in flue gas increases with liquid fraction in early melting stage yet remains constant in later melting stage. Copyright Â© 2014 by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.

A modified k-Îµ turbulence model was used to describe liquid phase turbulence in the simulation, by assuming the pseudo turbulence resulted from anodic bubbles. The effects of current density on the electrolyte fluid field, bubble volume fraction and bubble size distribution were investigated. The results show that the fluid field adopts a local loop flow pattern. The bubble volume fraction and bubble mean Sauter diameter both decrease with the increase of distance from the anode bottom at the same current density. At the same level, the bubble volume fraction increases and the bubble mean Sauter diameter decreases with the increase of the current density. The bubble layer has a thin square shape, with higher bubble volume fraction in central area, but lower in boundary area. It seems to be evident that a big number of small bubbles coexist with a few numbers of medium and big bubbles. The correlation between the number of bubbles and bubble diameter has nearly a hyperbolic shape, but the volume fraction distribution of bubble classes show a shape of three unimodal distributions. The simulation results are in accordance with a series of literature experimental results.

84907210140	CFD simulation of dissolution process of alumina in an aluminum reduction cell with two-particle phase population balance model	The dissolution process of alumina in a three-dimensional 300 kA aluminum reduction cell was modeled and simulated employing our custom code. A two-particle phase population balance model (TPPBM) was proposed by dividing solid phase into two groups consisting of small and large size alumina particles separately. A CFD-TPPBM coupled model was developed to describe the liquid-solid flow and dissolution process based on dissolution reaction kinetics mechanism. The effects of alumina effective diffusion coefficient, bath superheat, alumina preheating temperature and alumina feeding positions were studied numerically. The results show that the transport characteristics of alumina are controlled to great extent by the bubble driven forces in some local areas, while the electromagnetic forces can help alumina transported from the feeding positions to the whole cell. An increase of alumina effective diffusion coefficient can effectively benefit the dissolution process of the small alumina particles. It is advantageous to improve the dissolution process of the large alumina particles using higher bath superheat or alumina preheating temperature. The point feeding zone is preferable located at inter-anode gaps. The small alumina particles are dissolved quickly and completely in about 10 s after the feeding while the large alumina particles are dissolved much slowly.

84911466167	Numerical simulation of alumina concentration distribution in melts of aluminum reduction cells	The anode gas/electrolyte two-phase flow occurring during the transport process of alumina in the melts of aluminum reduction cells was simulated numerically by using an Euler-Euler two-fluid model coupled with a transport equation for alumina concentration. A modified k-Îµ turbulence model was used to describe the liquid phase turbulence in the simulation by assuming the pseudo turbulence resulted from anodic gas. The effects of alumina dissolution and consumption were involved in the alumina transport equation. The simulated results show that both anode gas forces and electromagnetic forces (EMFs) have a significant impact on the bath flow field. The anode gas forces have certain effect on the uniform alumina distribution in some local positions, but the EMFs have a wider range of influence and promote the transport process in alumina in the whole cell quickly. The concentration distribution can reach a periodic state, and this final periodic state is independent of the initial condition. The feeding points should be located at the intersection positions of central channel and inter-anode channel as well as the edge of the large vortex streamlines to speed up the dissolution and transport process of alumina, resulting in the more uniform alumina distribution.
