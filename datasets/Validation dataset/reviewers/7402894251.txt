15044351092	Influence of 1-butanethiol and metal ions on hydrogenation of trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal at platinum nanocatalysts	The catalytic behavior of platinum nanoparticles modified by iron (III) ions and 1-butanethiol was evaluated by determining the selectivity of hydrogenation of trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal, where the hydrogenation products were monitored by UV-vis spectroscopy and gas chromatograph. For the pure platinum nanoparticles, the selectivity to trans,trans-2,4-hexadienal is less than 5%; while for platinum nanoparticles modified by iron (III) ions and 1-butanethiol, the selectivity increased to 78% with a conversion of 86.5%. The enhancement in the selectivity of the reaction can be attributed to the synergic effects of iron (III) and 1-butanethiol. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By the observation of AFM, it is shown that partially hydrated polyacrylamide(HPAM)/hexadecyltrimethylammonium(CTAB) complex films appear in the morphology of patch aggregates. Amphoteric HPAM/CTAB complexes are observed to form filbrelike structures. Salts in the subphase have an impact on the morphology of interface complexes. Furthermore, the surface pressure relaxation revealed that the conformational changes of interface complexes are directly related to the stability of the films.

30044433646	Synthesis of platinum metal cluster stabilized by 4-diphenylamino-benzoic acid and its catalytic performances in hydrogenation	Platinum metal cluster, used in catalytic hydrogenation of m-phenoxy benzaldehyde, was prepared in aqueous ethanol solution by using 4-diphenylamino-benzoic acid (DPABA) as stabilizer. The platinum metal cluster was characterized by means of TEM, FTIR, and XRD. Stable colloidal suspension of platinum metal cluster could be obtained in relative wide range(1~10) of n(Pt) : n(DPABA). When n(Pt) : n(DPABA) = 5, average diameter of platinum metal cluster was 2 nm. Each Pt atom on cluster surface was bonded with about 56 DPABA molecules. About 50% of platinum metal cluster surface was not passivated and available for catalytic hydrogenation of m-phenoxy benzaldehyde. Conversion of m-phenoxy benzaldehyde was more than 99% at 30°C for 11 h by using the platinum metal cluster as catalyst.

30444461580	Thermal decomposition behaviors of PVP coated on platinum nanoparticles	TG-DTA, TEM, and IR were used to investigate the thermal decomposition behavior of poly(N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (PVP). The TG-DTA results show that the thermal decomposition behavior of PVP on platinum (Pt) is quite different from that of pure PVP. For pure PVP, 95.25% is decomposed when the temperature is increased up to 500°C; while under the same experimental condition, PVP coated on the Pt nanoparticles is only 66.7% decomposed. This is further supported by IR measurement. TEM results exhibited that the partially decomposed PVP still plays a role in stabilizing Pt nanoparticles: after heating treatment at 500°C for half an hour, the platinum nanoparticles did not aggregate heavily. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The MHPAM molecule chains are stretched forming worm-like coils due to the electrostatic repulsion between randomly distributed positive charges along the chain at pH 3. The further data analysis demonstrates single MHPAM molecules are being imaged. In addition, morphology of Langmuir-Blodgett films of MHPAM/CTAB complexes on mica surfaces also investigated as a function of the subphase pH. At pH 6, MHPAM/CTAB molecules covered on mica surfaces adopted the worm-like nanostructures, and at pH 7, conformational transition of polymer complexes appeared, showing the morphology of bump-like to some extent owing to aggregation of intrachains and interchains.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy showed that nearly monodisperse nanoparticles having average diameters of 2.6 ± 0.5 and 3.1 ± 0.7 nm for Pt/Pd and Pt/Au bimetallic nanoparticles formed. The colloidal solution of the bimetallic nanoparticles stabilized by OAAPS is stable without precipitation for 3 months at room temperature since OAAPS can offer strong bonding to the bimetallic nanoparticles through the chelating effect. Pt/Pd bimetallic nanoparticles stabilized by OAAPS showed much higher catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of phenyl aldehydes to phenyl alcohols than their monometallic counterparts. The Pd atoms in Pt/Pd nanoparticles promoted the activity of the catalytic hydrogenation mainly through geometric and electronic effects. The bimetallic nanoparticles stabilized by OAAPS can be separated from the reaction system and reused by simply adjusting the pH of the colloidal solution. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As the SEM imaging exhibited, Pt nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the surface of each RGO sheet, performing an alternative covering structure of RGO and Pt nanoparticle multi-layer on the CF electrode.

Experimental results demonstrate that the prepared N-Pt/RGO/CF electrode shows good electrochemical properties and enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward methanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium as compared with the Pt/RGO/CF electrode without layer-by-layer structure or the Pt/CF electrode without RGO. It is due to the unique 3D pore structure of N-Pt/RGO/CF and the good electron transport property of RGO in the composite electrode. Copyright © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Smart pH-sensitive Pt nanoparticles were successfully prepared for the first time by using octa(N,N-diacetic acid phenylamine)silsesquioxane (OAPAS) as a macromolecular protective agent. As-prepared Pt nanoparticles can self-aggregate or redisperse by only changing the pH of the system solution. In the weak acidic or alkaline solution (pH > 4.0), the Pt nanoparticles dispersed homogenously; while in the acidic solution (pH = 2.5), they self-aggregated. The dynamic self-aggregation and redispersion processes of the Pt nanoparticles driven by pH changes were revealed by transmission electron microscopy measurements. Electrocatalytic experiments proved that the platinum nanoparticles as a recyclable catalyst showed excellent activity for the hydrogenation of aldehyde after runs of five times.

As-formed electrodes are characterized by SEM, EDX and electrochemical analysis. Relative to Pt and Pt-Ru deposited on the bare GC (i.e., Pt/GC and Pt-Ru/GC), Pt/PCZ/GC and Pt-Ru/PCZ/GC, respectively, exhibit higher catalytic activity and stronger poisoning-tolerance ability towards formic acid electrooxidation. The enhanced performance is proposed to come from the synergetic effect between metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pt-Ru) and PCZ. At the same time, the results of the stripping voltammograms of CO show that PCZ can weaken largely the adsorption strength of CO on catalysts and can make CO oxidation easier under lower potential, implying further that PCZ can be used as an efficient promoter for electrocatalytic oxidation of formic acid on Pt/PCZ and Pt-Ru/PCZ catalysts. © 2010 Professor T.

84862526476	Highly efficient electrocatalytic performance based on Pt nanoflowers modified reduced graphene oxide/carbon cloth electrode	In this paper, a facile electrochemical approach is developed towards synthesizing Pt nanoflowers modified reduced graphene oxide (RGO) wrapped carbon cloth (CC) as an anode (Pt nanoflowers/RGO/CCE) for formic acid and methanol electrooxidation. As revealed by SEM measurements, the carbon cloth is well wrapped by the RGO, and the RGO wrapped carbon cloth serves as an excellent support for electrochemically anchoring Pt nanoflowers, being more well-dispersed than without RGO. Compared with Pt nanoparticles/CCE, Pt nanoparticles/RGO/CCE, and Pt nanoflowers/CCE, the Pt nanoflowers/RGO/CCE displays a distinctly enhanced current density of CVs towards formic acid and methanol electrooxidation. The utilization of graphene results in well-dispersed Pt nanostructures with a uniform size and unique morphology structure; a relatively large surface area; and excellent electron or charge transfer rate, contributing to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. The work likely opens up new promise for developing novel, low-cost yet highly efficient carbon material-based electrodes, especially for direct formic acid fuel cells and direct methanol fuel cells. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Catalyst samples are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical methods. SEM results reveal that the samples are composed of near-spherical microparticles. Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry results show that the addition of Au into composite catalysts is beneficial to the electro-catalytic oxidation of methanol and the anti-poisoning ability of platinum for methanol oxidation is enhanced. At the same time, the different content of Au in composite catalysts has been studied for methanol electro-oxidation, the results show that Pt-Au/ITO catalyst has the best catalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation when the molar ratio of Pt to Au is 1.07:1.

High efficient electrochemical oxidation of small organic molecules will be directly related to the development and application of low-temperature fuel cells. The current state of the art employs carbon-supported platinum and platinum alloys as anode and cathode catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells. However, carbon material may cause easily Pt particle aggregation and carbon corrosion occurred by electrochemical oxidation, which lower the utilization rate of Pt and the lifetime of fuel cell. CPs have attracted great attention because of their advantages of high anti corrosion, low resistance and high stability.

The combined merits of GE and CFE endow the electrode with large specific surface area and high electrical conductivity. The advantage of thus obtained GE/CFE for UA detection is supported by its higher peak current intensity and lower oxidation potential compared with those of bare glassy carbon electrode (GCE), bare carbon fiber electrode (CFE), and graphene-modified glassy carbon electrode (GE/GCE). Further amperometric study gives a wide liner range from 0.194 μM to 49.68 μM and a low detection limit of 0.132 μM (S/N= 3) with fast response time for the determination of UA on GE/CFE.

SEM characterization suggests that as-formed Pt/Au/GC electrode grows in a Stranski-Krastanov mode, resulting in a nearly ideal layered structure with Au at the inner layer and Pt at the outer layer. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized Pt/Au/GC electrode towards formic acid electrooxidation was studied, and comparative experiments with other modified electrodes (i.e., Pt/GC, Pt/Au, and Pt/Pt) were also conducted. As a result, the electrocatalytic activity of the outer-layered Pt depends significantly on the intrinsic properties of the substrates. The prepared Pt/Au/GC electrode with Au nanoparticles modified GC as the substrate shows remarkable catalytic activity for the formic acid oxidation, much higher than that of its counterparts, Pt/GC, Pt/Au, and Pt/Pt electrodes. Additionally, the measured electrochemical impedance spectra indicate that the charge-transfer resistance for formic acid electrooxidation on Pt/Au/GC electrode is smaller than that on other Pt modified electrodes.

They are more welcomed for better economic and ecofriendly properties, because of the homogenous dispersion and decreased dosage of noble metal particles inside the conducting polymer matrix. The conducting polymer-metal composites have also been proved to exhibit better catalytic performance than that of the bulk metal electrodes. In this short review, a series of conducting polymer-metal composite catalysts have been evaluated on their electrocatalytic performance for formic acid oxidation.

This nanohybrid was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-vis spectra, which demonstrated that the TPPH molecule was attached on the surface of the graphene nanosheet. The results of fluorescence quenching and photocurrent enhancement of TPPH-RGO exhibit that the fast electrons transfer from photoexcited TPPH molecules to RGO sheets. Compared with bare TPPH or RGO functional Pt nanoparticles, the TPPH-sensitized RGO loaded with Pt nanoparticles shows remarkable enhanced photocatalytic activity under UV-vis light irradiation. The superior electron-accepting and electron-transporting properties of graphene greatly accelerate the electron transfer from excited TPPH to Pt catalysts, which promote the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. More importantly, with the assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant, the catalytic activity and stability is further improved owing to aggregation prevention of TPPH-RGO nanocomposites. Our investigation might not only initiate new opportunities for the development of a facile synthesis yet highly efficient photoinduced hydrogen evolution system (composed of organic dye functionalized graphene) but also pave a new avenue for constructing graphene-based matericals with enhanced catalytic performance and stability under surfactant assistance. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

Here, we report the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) combined with reduced graphene oxide (PEDOT-RGO) as the support of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) for ethanol electrooxidation in alkaline medium. The as-prepared Pd/PEDOT-RGO composite catalysts are characterized by Raman spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microcopy, and scanning electron microcopy. PEDOT-RGO composite with the porous structure facilitates the dispersion of Pd NPs with a smaller size leading to the increase of electrochemical active surface area.

The electrochemical activity and stability of the as-formed copolymer are significantly improved in comparison with poly(5-aminoindole) due to the incorporation of EDOT units into the conjugated chain. The copolymer film-modified CC electrode was used as substrate for Pt particle deposition (denoted as Pt/copolymer/CC), and then, its catalytic activity towards formic acid electrooxidation was studied. Experimental results indicate that the catalytic activity of Pt/copolymer/CC towards formic acid electrooxidation is enhanced in comparison with that of Pt/homopolymer/CC, which can be attributed to the homogeneous distribution of Pt nanoparticles on the copolymer/CC substrate and the improved electrochemical activity of the copolymer film. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Using the Pt-TPPAN nanocomposite as a photocatalyst, a new and more compact photoinduced hydrogen evolution system from an aqueous ethanol solution without additives was developed.

The photocatalytic activity results suggested that this TPPAN functionalized Pt nano-assembly could efficiently catalyze hydrogen evolution from an aqueous ethanol solution under simulated solar light irradiation.

By changing the concentrations of DA, UA and AA in the three substances coexisting system, the linear response ranges for the determination of DA, UA and AA were 0.1-400 μM, 2-600 μM, and 0.7-100 μM with the limit of detection (LOD) (S/N = 3) were estimated to be 0.1 μM, 1 μM and 0.7 μM, respectively. Moreover, it is found that RGO/GCE displays high reproducibility and selectivity for the determination of DA, UA and AA. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.

84904626258	Triphenylamine-based dye functionalized platinum colloid for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water: Synthesis, characterization, electron transfer, and photocatalysis	A multibranched triphenylamine-based dye (tris(4-(2-(2-(pyridin-2-yl))-carbonyl-vinyl-)phenyl)amine) functionalized platinum homogeneous catalyst was successfully synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis), and fluorescence studies. The FT-IR, TEM, and XRD studies demonstrated that the as-prepared homogeneous catalyst could be described as an organic-inorganic nanosphere composed of an organic multibranched dye shell and a platinum nanocore (ca. 2.9. nm). The fluorescence quenching and fluorescence decay studies indicated that the interfacial electrons transferred directly from the dye molecule to the platinum nanoparticle in this homogeneous catalyst under light irradiation. The homogeneous catalyst could be used as a stable photocatalyst for homogeneous photoinduced hydrogen evolution without an electron relay under UV-vis light irradiation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

84906871302	Facile synthesis of PVP-assisted PtRu/RGO nanocomposites with high electrocatalytic performance for methanol oxidation	In this paper, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-stabilized PtRu/RGO nanocomposites (PtRu/RGO/PVP) by the one-pot method. The structure, morphology and composition of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by Raman, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. It was found that PVP plays an important role in controlling the size of PtRu nanoparticles (NPs) as well as their dispersion stability. TEM images show that as-prepared PtRu NPs with a mean particle size of about 3.09 nm are uniformly dispersed on the RGO surface in the presence of PVP. The electrocatalytic properties of the as-prepared catalysts were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). Compared to PtRu/RGO and PtRu/PVP catalysts, our PtRu/RGO/PVP hybrids exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability for the methanol oxidation reaction. Moreover, our multicomposites also showed higher electrocatalytic performance than the commercial PtRu/C catalysts. The PtRu/RGO/PVP nanostructures with an optimized molar ratio of Pt/Ru (1 : 1) displayed 1.96 times greater stability than the commercial PtRu/C nanospecies. These findings indicated that PtRu/RGO catalysts show a promising future of potential applications in direct methanol fuel cells with the assistance of PVP stabilized. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84906317350	A facile electrochemical sensor based on reduced graphene oxide and Au nanoplates modified glassy carbon electrode for simultaneous detection of ascorbic acid, dopamine and uric acid	A facile Au nanoplates and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was fabricated via a simple electrochemical method, denoted as Au/RGO/GCE. The Au/RGO/GCE electrode was used for the simultaneous detection of ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine (DA) and uric acid (UA). The modified electrodes fabricated by different methods presented different morphologies and performances for determination of AA, DA, and UA. Three well-defined voltammetric peaks along with remarkable increasing electrooxidation currents were obtained on the Au/RGO/GCE with needle-like Au nanoplates in differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements. It was found that there are linear relationships between the peak currents and the concentrations in the range of 2.4 × 10

84910029637	Au-Cu-Pt ternary catalyst fabricated by electrodeposition and galvanic replacement with superior methanol electrooxidation activity	A series of Au-Cu-Pt ternary catalysts were fabricated on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) by a two-step method. Au-Cu nanoparticles were formed by initial electrodeposition of Au-Cu layers onto GCE and then followed by the partial replacement of Cu by Pt. The morphology and composition of Au-Cu-Pt catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), EDX element mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the alloying micro-structures existed in the catalysts among Au, Cu and/or the partially replaced Pt. Moreover, electrochemical measurements revealed that despite low loading of Pt, the Au-Cu-Pt/GCE-10 catalyst presented superior electrocatalytic activity and stability to that of the other comparative electrodes toward methanol electrooxidation (MEO). It indicated that this two-step method can efficiently decrease the amount of Pt loading in the catalyst. These findings also suggested that the prepared Au-Cu-Pt catalyst has a great potential for use in the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC).

11844277606	Morphology of adsorption anionic polyelectrolytes to mica substrate in different environment visualized by atomic force microscopy	We have observed the morphology of an anionic polyelectrolyte (partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide) (HPAM) adsorbed to mica surface in different environment using atomic force microscopy with molecular resolution. HPAM molecules deposited on the mica surface from aqueous solution at natural pH were observed to form a nanostructured network. However, the nanostructured network-to-globule conformational transition on mica can be directly visualized when the mica substrate with the predeposited HAPM molecules was immersed into chloroform. Meanwhile, necklace-like globule conformation on mica can be obtained in the presence of NaCl. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
