84929572102	Action selection for active and cooperative global localization based on localizability estimation	In this paper we investigate the action selection problem for multiple mobile robots active and cooperative global localization in large environments. Firstly, an off-line localizability estimation approach using known probabilistic grid map (PGM) is briefly proposed and a localizability matrix is presented to describe properties of expected localization probability distribution (LPD). Based on the proposed localizability matrix, a novel on-line action selection mechanism is further presented which enables mobile robots to actively collaborate with each other and select complementary actions with redundant information exclusion. This action selection mechanism brings the lowest expected localization covariance in each localization cycle and can accelerate the converging speed of global localization. Efficiency in time complexity also ensures that the proposed method could be used in real applications. The appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated through simulations and real experiments.

84929589919	Adaptive visual tracking control of uncertain rigid-link electrically driven robotic manipulators with an uncalibrated fixed camera	The adaptive image-based trajectory tracking control problem of rigid-link electrically driven (RLED) robotic manipulators is addressed in this paper. A fixed camera configuration is considered and the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are assumed to be unknown. Furthermore, the manipulator dynamic and motor dynamic parameters are assumed to be uncertain and the depths of feature points can be allowed to be time varying. The depth-independent interaction matrix framework is used such that unknown parameters in the closed-loop dynamics can be parameterized linearly and adaptive laws can be derived to estimate them online. By simultaneously taking into consideration the mechanical and electrical subsystem dynamics of RLED robotic manipulators, the backstepping technique is used to design control voltage inputs to guarantee the tracking of desired image trajectories in the presence of parameter uncertainties and time-varying depth information. Asymptotical convergence of image tracking errors to zeros is proved by using Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results based on a 3-DOFs anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are given to demonstrate the performance of the proposed adaptive visual tracking scheme.

0030358966	Generalized state-space description of positive realness and bounded realness	Positive realness and bounded realness are two important issues in system theory. Some related applications about these notions include analysis and synthesis of passive networks, optimal designs in control and estimation, stability investigations in linear/nonlinear closed-loops; etc.. In this paper, we propose the equations of constant matrices, which are stabilizable and detectable realizations of impulse-free generalized state-space systems, to describe the positive real and bounded real properties. The established generalized positive real lemma and generalized bounded real lemma are necessary and sufficient. They are the extensions of results in [5], in which the state-space realizations are considered. The impulse-free generalized state-space systems contain both finite and nondynamic infinite modes. The state-space systems contain finite modes only. To express those algebraic restrictions among state variables is easier in the generalized state-space.

28344440404	A new approach to visual servoing in uncalibrated environments	The objective of the work is to regulate selected features to desired positions on the image plane by controlling motion of a robot manipulator. We assume the system is totally uncalibrated, i.e. both the camera intrinsic parameters and the homogeneous transformation matrix between the robot frame and the vision frame are not calibrated. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters on-line. The proposed controller adopts the simple PD plus the gravity compensation scheme with the estimated parameters. A new Lyapunov function is introduced to prove asymptotic convergence of the position errors on the image plane and convergence of the estimated parameters to the real ones up to a scale.

33646065974	GNSS availability analysis in Taiwan - A markov model approach	The main purpose of this paper is to present a Markov process approach to the analysis of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) availability in Taiwan. The proposed model is capable of calculating a variety of statistical measures of the required services at locations specified by the user. The primary input data for the availability model is the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) and failure rate of the GPS (Global Positioning System) satellites. Then each visible set of satellites is checked to see if it satisfies the service accuracy criterion. Finally, in order to meet the integrity requirement, the number of the satellites and their corresponding geometry are verified to see if they meet the integrity threshold. For other types of navigation systems configurations (such as GBAS, GRAS, or SBAS) different service criteria may be added in the model. The analysis addresses GPS constellation of 24 satellites, and augmentation with geostationay satellites or pseudolites. Availability estimates for GPS, SBAS and GBAS are obtained by software simulation.

33747619166	Uncalibrated visual servoing of robots using a depth-independent interaction matrix	This paper presents a new adaptive controller for image-based dynamic control of a robot manipulator using a fixed camera whose intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are not known. To map the visual signals onto the joints of the robot manipulator, this paper proposes a depth-independent interaction matrix, which differs from the traditional interaction matrix in that it does not depend on the depths of the feature points. Using the depth-independent interaction matrix makes the unknown camera parameters appear linearly in the closed-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm is developed to estimate their values on-line. This adaptive algorithm combines the Slotine-Li method with on-line minimization of the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane. Based on the nonlinear robot dynamics, we prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors to zero by the Lyapunov theory.

33845652759	Uncalibrated visual tracking control without visual velocity	This paper presents a new adaptive controller for dynamic tracking of a robot manipulator without visual velocity when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. Most controllers in the past require the measurement of the visual velocity or differentiation of the visual position. The measurement of the visual velocity is subject to big noises in general due to low sampling rates of the vision loop. To avoid performance decaying caused by measurement errors of the visual velocity, the controller we developed requires estimated visual velocity only.

58149391258	A behavioral approach to GNSS positioning and DOP determination	In this paper, a behavioral framework is proposed to solve dynamic GNSS positioning problems, which in the mean time may also provide a way to determine the DOP (dilution of precision) of a moving object. The concept of behavioral framework was first proposed by Jan C. Willems in a series of papers (J.C. Willems, "From time series to linear system - part I, II, and III," Automatica Vol. 22, 1986.) as a generic tool for mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In the proposed approach, a GNSS positioning problem is firstly described by a kernel representation and then the problem can be solved by a structured total least-squares (STLS) algorithm. STLS algorithm is a modified version of the traditional total least-squares (TLS) method. It can be shown that the STLS algorithm is able to provide better performance than the TLS algorithm for the problems that possess a particular structure. In the case of the present paper, it is shown that the GNSS positioning problem has a Hankel structure (i.e., the geometric matrix of the pseudorange equation is Hankel), therefore the problem can be solved by an STLS algorithm subject to a Hankel structure. On the other hand, a formula for calculating DOP of a dynamic positioning problem is also provided. The proposed method is able to calculate the DOP value for multiple time epochs, in compared with the conventional DOP formula which can only be derived at a single lime epoch, so as to reflect the inter-dependency between consecutive time epochs.

84867303329	Barrier method for GPS multipath estimation	In this paper, a barrier method for GPS positioning and multipath mitigation is proposed. The present method can effectively eliminate the NLOS (non-line-ofsight) delay errors and is also able to improve the location accuracy of a satellite navigation receiver. A constrained WLS (weighted least-squares) estimator is derived based on the proposed algorithm, which is able to properly estimate and eliminate the multipath error contained in each satellite's pseudorange. In our experimental result, it is demonstrated that the proposed estimator can compute the coordinate of a user location in an accurate fashion after estimating and removing the measurement biases. This is done by suitably choosing the barrier functions. The proposed method is well suitable in the positioning domain in contrast with traditional GPS multipath mitigation methods which usually apply in the signalprocessing domain. Furthermore, it can be used to identify the NLOS signal where the LOS signal may not present in the received signal.

70449564757	A novel attitude and motion determination algorithm based on dual quaternion	In this paper, we present a dual-quaternion approach to solve the problem of (simultaneously) three-dimensional (3-D) attitude, position and relative motion determination by using two-dimensional (2-D) intensity image measurement. Here we shall apply this method to a relatively new field, namely the problem of tracking and surveillance of moving vehicle. A solution to this problem that uses two-dimensional, intensity images from a single camera is desirable for real-time applications. A single camera is advantageous because a standard video camera is low in cost, setup and calibration are simple, physical space requirements are small, reliability is high, and low-cost hardware is available for digitizing and processing the images. In this paper, solutions to the remote measurement (using a single camera) problem for a dynamic system given a sequence of 2-D intensity images of an object are provided for both of the cases where feature positions of the object are known relative to a base reference frame and where feature positions are unknown relative to a base reference frame. In both cases, the location of the base reference frame is calculated in a timely manner by using the differential GPS positioning concept, where the DGPS correction is sent via a wireless network.

70449645138	A novel wireless network-based carrier-aided DGPS algorithm design and implementation	In this paper, we designed a novel Carrier-Aided DGPS algorithm and implemented the service via Wi-Fi and/or mobile network. The main concept of Differential GPS (DGPS) is that there are some common errors between the receiver in the reference station, which we shall call "reference receiver", and the receiver at the user side, which we shall call "client receiver". The reference station is able to calculate the common errors and then send the correction messages to the user. In this paper, we have implemented DGPS service via Wi-Fi instead of radio signals to send the DGPS corrections. Furthermore, with the help of the carrier information, we also realize a novel differential Carrier Smoothed Code (CSC) method which is different and possesses many advantages in compared with traditional CSC algorithm. The algorithm is named Carrier-Aided DGPS (CADGPS). While the traditional CSC method is often used in a standalone receiver, the proposed differential CSC algorithm, as suggested by the name itself, is able to be used in the DGPS positioning mode. The experimental results will be presented in the paper. Consequently, the proposed CADGPS algorithm indeed performed well in the results.

To avoid performance decaying caused by measurement errors of the visual velocity we propose a new image-based tracking controller based on the proposal of an estimator of visual velocity. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot manipulator, we proved the convergence of the image errors of the trajectory to zero and the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale by the Lyapunov method. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate good convergence of the trajectory errors under the control of the proposed method. © 2010 IEEE.

78649269213	Toward real-time precise point positioning: Differential GPS based on IGS ultra rapid product	In this paper, the problem of GPS precise point positioning (PPP) using single frequency data is investigated. Traditionally, GPS PPP can only be achieved by using the P code signal or using dual-frequency, where the former is only accessible to authorized personnel and the later is usually done in a post-processing manner. In view of this, there is still a need for a real-time publicly accessible PPP service. In this paper, we present a differential GPS algorithm that is capable of providing real-time near PPP service. In the proposed method, IGS ultra-rapid product is used to calculate vector differential GPS correction, therefore it is capable of providing wide-area DGPS service. By transforming the vector into a scalar correction, we show that a conventional GPS receiver may also utilize the correction to yield a real-time precise point positioning. © 2010 SICE.

78651490670	Vision-based robotic tracking of moving object with dynamic uncertainty	This paper presents a new controller for locking a moving object in 3-D space at a particular position (for example the center) on the image plane of a camera mounted on a robot by actively moving the camera. The controller is designed to cope with both unknown robot dynamics parameters and unknown motion of the object. Based on the fact that the unknown position of the moving object appears linearly in the closed-loop dynamics of the system if the depth-independent image Jacobian is used, we developed a nonlinear observer to estimate the 3-D motion of the object on-line and an adaptive algorithm to estimate the robot dynamic parameters. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the robot, we employed the Lyapunov method to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors. Experimental results are presented to support the approach in this paper. ©2010 IEEE.

79952569099	GPS receiver tracking loop optimization based on a behavioral approach	In this paper, the GPS tracking loop design problem is investigated by using a behavioral approach. The concept of behavioral framework was first proposed by Jan C. Willems in a series of papers (J.C. Willems, "From time series to linear system - part I, II, and III," Automatica Vol. 22, 1986.) as a generic tool for mathematical modeling of dynamical systems. In the last decade, the behavioral point of view has received an increasingly broader acceptance as an approach for modeling dynamic systems, and now it is generally viewed as a cogent framework for system analysis. One of the reasons for its success has to be looked for in the fact that it does not start with the input/output point of view for describing how a system interacts with its environment, but focuses on the set of system trajectories, the behavior, and hence on the mathematical model describing the relations among all system variables. In the proposed approach, the dynamical model of the GPS receiver tracking loop (carrier loop and code loop) is firstly described by a kernel representation. We will then show that the loop filter design can be cast in a global total lease-squares problem, which can be solved by a structured total least-squares (STLS) algorithm. STLS algorithm is a modified version of the traditional total least-squares (TLS) method. It can be shown that the STLS algorithm is able to provide better performance than the TLS algorithm for the problems that possess a particular structure. In the case of the present paper, it is shown that the tracking loop filter design problem has a Hankel structure, therefore the problem can be solved by an STLS algorithm subject to a Hankel structure.

Usefulness of the method is then illustrated by a numerical example, which is concerned with the derivation of the optimal guidance law for spacecraft. This kind of problems is called trajectory-prescribed path control (TPPC) in the literature. We reformulate the problem as a Hamiltonian DAE system (usually with a higher index). After establishing the system of spacecraft dynamics, we can derive the optimal guidance law of the system by the proposed numerical method.

79956309092	Modified algorithm for eliminating user position biases caused by satellite constellation changes	When the user-satellite constellation is changed (gaining and/or losing satellites), it may result in the user position biases. The biases are undesirable in some applications. In [1], an algorithm called Position Bias Filter (PBF) was designed to solve the problem. The concept of the filter is to calculate the difference before and after the satellite constellation changed which can be used for correcting the position vector. However, their method is not very efficient for they need to re-calculate the position fix before and after the constellation change. From the algebraic operations' point of view, the difference can be derived by a recursive way. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a modified algorithm named modified position bias filter (MPBF) to enhance the efficiency and performance of the previous one. In the proposed algorithm, we derive a recursive update process so that the time consumption can be greatly reduced. On the other hand, we notice that there may be another bias introduced by the usual PBF algorithm for the method just keeps subtracting a constant positioning bias. In our experiment, the result shows that the positioning bias (caused by satellite constellation change) tends to decrease with time. Therefore, in this paper a forgetting factor (means that the influence of the positioning bias is forgot as time goes by) is also introduced for reducing the biases and the result of the experiment shows that the performance of PBF may be significantly improved.

The concept of behavioral framework was first proposed by Jan C. Willems in a series of papers (J. C. Willems, "From time series to linear system - part I, II, and III," Automatica Vol. 22, 1986.) as a generic tool for mathematical modeling of dynamical systems.

STLS algorithm is a modified version of the traditional total least-squares (TLS) method. It can be shown that the STLS algorithm is able to provide better performance than the TLS algorithm for the problems that possess a particular structure. In the case of the present paper, it is shown that the orbital determination problem has a Hankel structure; therefore the problem can be solved by an STLS algorithm subject to a Hankel structure. GPS satellite orbital prediction is particular useful for the indoor GPS application. By using the proposed method, users need not to wait for the GPS receiver to download the ephemeris data from the satellites which is usually a time-consuming process. We simply store the behavioral model in the receiver's software (or firmware). Then the satellite's orbit can be computed without collecting the broadcast ephemeris data.

79957979903	Dynamic visual servoing of robots in uncalibrated environments	This paper presents a new adaptive controller for dynamic image-based visual servoing of a robot manipulator when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. To cope with nonlinear dependence of the image Jacobian on the unknown parameters, this controller employs a matrix called nonscaled image Jacobian which does not depend on the scale factors determined by the depths of feature points. By removing the scale factors, the camera parameters appear linearly in the close-loop dynamics so that a new algorithm, different from Slotine and Li's, is developed to estimate their values on-line. In the parameter adaptation, in addition to the regressor term, our algorithm also uses the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature points on the image plane so as to guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. A new Lyapunov function is introduced to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors based on the robot dynamics. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller. © 2005 IEEE.

84860758977	Unknown constrained mechanisms operation based on dynamic hybrid compliance control	In order to operate unknown constrained mechanisms with assistive robot manipulators, a dynamic hybrid compliance control algorithm was proposed in the paper. The controller using the proposed algorithm was designed to estimate constrained frame, determine driving-axis and obtain control velocity. Firstly, the constrained frame was estimated online according to the previous motion direction, and a suitable direction was selected as driving-axis by selection matrix; then hybrid position/force control was adopted to decouple the driving-axis and non-driving-axis; finally, velocity control was used at the driving-axis and impedance control was used at the non-driving-axis. The proposed dynamic hybrid compliance control algorithm made manipulators find a suitable direction as the driving-axis to operate the constrained mechanisms. And the dynamic characteristics of operation were improved. The validity of the proposed method was verified by the experiments of autonomous door opening utilizing a 6-DoF manipulator. © 2011 IEEE.

84867279425	Using almanac data to improve efficiency of GPS signal acquisition	In this paper, we propose a novel method that is able to efficiently reduce the time to acquire the GPS signals by utilizing the almanac data set of the GPS satellites. If a user's rough location is known, the aforementioned information (satellite's almanac data) can be used to determine the visible satellites and their corresponding Doppler frequency shifts as well as code phase delays. The almanac data can be either obtained from last received (complete) navigation data or transmitted from the cell phone wireless service provider. Another factor that may influence the frequency shift is caused by the drift rate of the receiver clock. In this paper, we also propose a method to estimate the receiver's clock drift rate to improve the overall performance of the proposed algorithm. If the clock drift rate can be properly estimated, the time needed to acquire a satellite may be further reduced. It is known that the time required to acquire a satellite depends on the number of frequency bins and the number of possible code phase delays in the search space.

By extending the existing adaptive eye-in-hand visual servoing approach based on the depth-independent interaction matrix, in this paper, we propose an uncalibrated dynamic visual tracking approach for the eye-in-hand camera configuration by observing multiple feature points of a static object. The proposed approach can simultaneously handle the unknown camera parameters and the unknown 3D coordinates of the feature points, where a new adaptive law is developed to estimate these unknown parameters online. On the basis of nonlinear dynamics of robot manipulators, we also prove the asymptotic convergence of the image errors with the help of Lyapunov theory. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, preliminary simulation results will be given by using a two-link planar robot manipulator. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

84874983525	A chaotic-based pseudo-random bit generator for navigation applications	In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate pseudo-random-noise (PRN) bits for navigation applications. In the present method, the code sequence generator is constructed based on two chaotic logistic maps running parallel and starting from independent initial conditions. The logistic map is a simple mathematical model that shows bewildering complex behavior. By appropriately setting the initial conditions, the PRN sequence is then generated by comparing the outputs of both logistic maps. Several simulations are set up to verify the correlation properties of the pseudo-random bit generator (PRBG). The result shows that the code sequences generated by the proposed PRBG have great auto- and cross-correlation properties, which are very similar to the PRN sequences used by GPS navigation system. The RPBG sequences are therefore suitable for signal ranging that is used comprehensively in the navigation system. On the other hand, the chaotic nature of the proposed PRBG codes can provide more secure communication than the traditional PRN sequences. The proposed PRN sequences are well suitable to be incorporated with the so-called chaotic shift keying (CSK) modulation. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Also, a modified algorithm is designed to reduce the computation burden of original algorithm by a recursive method.

84882453973	Adaptive visual servoing using common image features with unknown geometric parameters	This paper generalizes the concept of the depth-independent interaction matrix, developed for point and line features in our early work, to generalized image features. We derive the conditions under which the depth-independent interaction matrix can be linearly parameterized by the geometric parameters of the generalized image features, and propose an adaptive visual servo controller for robot manipulators using the generalized image features whose geometric parameters are unknown. To estimate the unknown parameters on-line, we propose new error functions that are linear to estimation errors of the parameters and an algorithm that minimizes the error functions using multiple images. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove asymptotic stability of the proposed controller based on the nonlinear dynamics of the manipulator. It is also shown that in addition to points and lines, other common image features like distances, angles, areas, and centroids all satisfy the conditions for the linear parameterization. Experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed control method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84885777020	Adaptive visual servoing of robot manipulators	A novel adaptive controller is presented in this Chapter for image-based dynamic control of a robot manipulator when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera and the position coordinates of the feature points are unknown. Both the fixed camera and eye-in-hand camera configurations are considered. The key idea lies in the use of a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix to map the visual signals onto the joint space of the robot manipulator. By virtue of the depthindependent image Jacobian matrix, it is possible to linearly parameterize the closed loop dynamics of the system by the uncalibrated camera parameters and the unknown feature coordinates. A new adaptive algorithm, different from the Slotine and Li algorithm, has been proposed to estimate the unknown parameters and coordinates on-line. The asymptotic stability of the system under the control of the proposed method is rigorously proved by the Lyapunov theory with the nonlinear robot dynamics fully taken into account. © 2006 Springer.

The intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are already known. In order to estimate the 3D position of the rigid body target, three points (not collinear) from the rigid body were selected as reference. We assumed that these three points will never be occluded by the rigid body itself. Based on this assumption, we employ a new point adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm to track the rigid body and estimate its motion in real-Time. Simulation and experimental results are included to illustrate the performance of the proposed method on a 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot manipulator.

84893802693	Visual servo control of cable-driven soft robotic manipulator	Aim at enhancing dexterous and safe operation in unstructured environment, a cable-driven soft robotic manipulator is designed in this paper. Due to soft material it made of and nearly infinite degree of freedom it owns, the soft robotic manipulator has higher security and dexterity than traditional rigid-link manipulator, which make it suitable to perform tasks in complex environments that is narrow, confined and unstructured. Though the soft robotic manipulator possesses advantages above, it is not an easy thing for it to achieve precise position control. In order to solve this problem, a kinematic model based on piecewise constant curvature hypothesis is proposed. Through building up three spaces and two mappings, the relationship between the length variables of 4 cables and the position and orientation of the soft robotic manipulator end-effector is obtained. Afterwards, a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix is introduced and an image-based visual servo controller is presented. Applied by adaptive algorithm, the controller could estimate unknown position of the feature point online, and then Lyapunov theory is used to prove the stability of the proposed controller. At last, experiments are conducted to demonstrate rationality and validity of the kinematic model and adaptive visual servo controller. © 2013 IEEE.

The latter part enables one to get a smoother trajectory and reduce the tracking error. Moreover, the kinematic constraints of the robot are also taken into consideration by setting boundary on the absolute value of kinematical constraints.

84905681464	Sequential quadratic method for GPS NLOS positioning in Urban Canyon Environments	In this paper, the problem of GPS non-line-of-sight (NLOS) positioning in urban canyon environments is considered. We propose a new position-determination estimator based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) that is able to estimate and eliminate the path-delay error caused by the indirect transmission of the GPS signal. The estimator takes into account the measurement bias resulting from NLOS transmission and also improves the location accuracy of the satellite positioning system. The present method can effectively eliminate NLOS delay errors and improves the location accuracy of a satellite navigation receiver in an urban canyon environment. A Wilcoxon-norm-based regressor is further derived to improve the probability of detection of NLOS biases. The Wilcoxon regressor is a robust estimator that is well-suited to identifying outliers (in our case, NLOS biases) during the regression process. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed estimator can accurately compute a user's location after identifying and removing the measurement biases. © 2013 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.

There are multiple video sensors equipped on the robot. The transmission weight of each video was calculated according to the current tasks being executed by the robot. In multi-objective optimization, the algorithm distributeed the transmission bandwidth fairly to each video sensor based on their weight, and could guarantee that the total transmission bandwidth never exceeds the transmission bandwidth provided by the network. The transmission bandwidth was controlled by modifying the resolution and frame rate of the video acquisition. The algorithm reduced the lose rate of frames caused by network congestion, thus protects the integrity of real-time video, makes the teleoperation tasks of the system complete which depend on the visual image quality. The algorithm is tested by inspection tasks in an actual power plant environment. Smooth video transmission service has been provided and the practicability of the algorithm is also verified.
