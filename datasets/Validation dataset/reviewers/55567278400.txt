84938856983	Interactive effects of nitrogen and water addition on competitive hierarchies between early-and late-successional plant species	Increased nitrogen (N) and water availability, resulting from global changes or ecosystem management, were predicted to promote plant productivity and change community composition through shifts in competition hierarchies. So far, however, it still remains unclear how competitive interactions respond to N and water additions, which will be important to understand how plant community composition changes. To test plant competition ability in different successional stages under N and water addition treatments, a pot experiment under field conditions was performed. Six dominant plant species, three early-successional species, Artemisia lavandulaefolia, Artemisia capillaris, and Pennisetum centrasiaticum versus three late-successional species, Stipa krylovii, Leymus chinensis, and Artemisia frigida, were grown in monocultures and in two-species mixtures under factorial combinations of N and water addition treatments. We found that (1) there were interactive effects of N addition, water addition and interspecific competition on plant biomass; (2) For a given species, competitive abilities were correlated with biomass difference of neighboring species; (3) N and water additions interactively increased competition intensity and shifted species competitive hierarchies; (4) Late- successional species had stronger competitive abilities in the N addition treatment, whereas early-successional species had stronger competitive abilities after water addition or N + water addition. Our results show that N and water additions increased the intensity and impact of interspecific competition on plant growth, which has great implications for community structures. Since interspecific differences in competitive abilities were not well explained by species biomass, species identity, such as plant functional traits, should be included to predict the impact of increased N and water availability on plant communities and ecosystem functions.

33646394038	The transformation of betA gene into the pollen plantlets of Populus simoniixP. nigra	In this study, betA gene was introduced into the pollen plantlets of Populus simoniixP. nigra using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The four kanamycine-resistant plants obtained were identified as transgenic plants by PCR detection and the results were all positive (Fig.2). The result of quantitative real-time PCR detection showed that the betA gene was transcribed and expressed in all the transformed plants, but the transcript levels are different (Table 2). Test of salt-tolerance of the transgenic plants showed that 80%-100% of transgenic plants were rooted while 0 of non-transgenic plants were rooted at 0.55% NaCl stress, and O of transgenic plants were rooted at 0.70%-0.80% NaCl stress (Table 3). The betaine content analysis showed the betain content of the transgenic plants are obviously higher than that in non-transgenic plants (Fig.4), so transformation betA gene raised the salt tolerance to the transgenic plants.

33749606718	A novel LEA gene from Tamarix androssowii confers drought tolerance in transgenic tobacco	A novel LEA gene (DQ663481) was cloned from Tamarix androssowii. The cDNA sequence of this LEA gene is 676 bp in length, including 157 bp of the 5′ untranslated region and 207 bp of the 3′ untranslated region. The open reading frame (ORF) is 312 bp in length, encoding a deduced amino acid sequence of 103 residues with a molecular weight of 11.257 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.93. BLASTP analysis showed that the cloned LEA gene shares the highest identity in amino acid sequence (47%) with LEA5 from Nicotiana tabacum. The cloned LEA gene was transformed into tobacco, after which 10 transgenic lines were selected for drought tolerance testing. The malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrical conductivity, percentage of wilted leaves and relative rate of height growth were compared between transgenic and nontransgenic tobacco. The results showed that both the MDA content and relative electrical conductivity are lower significantly in transgenic plants under drought stress, implying that the LEA gene may enhance drought tolerance by protecting cell membranes from damage. The comparison of the percentage of wilted leaves and relative rate of height growth between transgenic and nontransgenic tobacco showed that, under drought stress, the presence of the LEA gene can induce an increase in height growth rate and a reduction in the number of wilted leaves. These results indicate that the T. androssowii LEA gene is an excellent drought tolerance gene and may have potential usage in the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in plants. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33845882483	Identification of expressed sequence tags in an alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora) cDNA library	Alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora), a monocotyledonous halophyte, can serve as a model of salt tolerance in monocotyledon crops. To elucidate the molecular events associated with salt tolerance in alkali grass, we generated a directional cDNA library from leaves treated with the alkali salt, NaHCO<inf>3</inf>. Large-scale sequencing of the cDNA library identified 2942 ESTs representing 2366 non-redundant transcripts. These have been deposited in the dbEST division of GenBank. BLASTX evaluation indicated that 1274 of the ESTs were homologous to various known genes/proteins in a broad range of organisms, especially gramineae species. The other 1092 ESTs, which showed little if any homology to known sequences, were considered novel. Based on the encoded proteins, the 1274 identified ESTs fell into 12 functional categories, of which four were abundant, namely metabolism (18.84%), transcription (12.48%), unclassified (11.22%) and cell rescue/defense (9.66%). The 162 unique transcripts corresponding to possible salt-related genes were also identified. This study provides an overview of gene expression in NaHCO<inf>3</inf>-stressed alkali grass, as well as useful information for further investigation of salt resistance in plants. © 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

33947236694	Gene cloning and sequence analysis of Thionins from Polygonum sibiricum Laxm.	A partial sequence of a thionins (THI) gene was obtained from a random clone in Polygonum sibiricum SSH library and THI was cloned by using rapid amplification of cDNA end (RACE) technology. The acquired gene was 789 bp in full length, including 5′ untranslated region of 90 bp, 3′ untranslated region of 276 bp with Poly A, and an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 140 amino acid. Sequence analysis indicated that the protein, such as most of the plant THI, was a precursor which could be divided into three distinct domains, including an amino-terminal (N-terminal) signal peptide, a mature THI and a carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) acidic domain, which were composed of 24, 46 and 70 amino acid respectively. THI was found to be highly homologous with that from other dicotyledon. All of them possessed a conserved plant THI signature sequence of "C-C-X(5)-R-X(2)-[FY]-X(2)-C". The mature THI had positive charge and showed slightly high basic. As result, it was possibly involved in antimicrobial activity and was identified as a new plant THI. The gene accession nucleotide sequence number in GenBank was DQ981482.

34547199438	Efficient tissue culture and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of haploid poplar derived from anthers	Calli were induced from anthers of Populus simonii × P. nigra. Haploid plants were then regenerated from the callus and multiplied efficiently by culturing leaf explants. The presence of both haploid and diploid cells in the same plant revealed spontaneous chromosome doubling in haploid cells. The haploid plants were transformed with the nptII gene by Agrobacterium-mediated method using leaf explants, and five independent kanamycin-resistant lines were obtained, with a transformation frequency more than 6%. Further PCR test indicated that the exogenous betA gene was transferred into these kanamycin-resistant lines, which were still haploid. Thus, the efficient tissue culture system and transformation of haploid poplar plants were achieved. Our study will contribute to forest improvement via the haploid culture and transgenic technology. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

35948942333	Gene expression in Puccinellia tenuiflora (Turcz.) Scribn. et Merr. under drought stress using cDNA microarray	The gene expression pattern in Puccinellia tenuiflora under drought stress was investigated using cDNA microarray. We constructed a cDNA microarray containing 660 unique genes from P. tenuiflora. The mRNA from drought treatment and control sample labeled with fluorescence dyestuff was used for cDNA microarray hybridization. Gene expression patterns in response to drought stress were studied through scanning and analysis of cDNA microarray. Totally 22 down-regulated genes and 17 up-regulated genes were identified under drought stress. BLASTX analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes involved in the functional groups such as dehydration protection, signal transduction and regulation, reactive oxygen species eliminated, metabolism. Among them, some function unknown genes and novel genes related to drought stress were also found. This research revealed some important pathways involved in drought-resistance in P. tenuiflora, and the gene expression profiles of P. tenuiflora after exposure to drought stress were constructed.

59649086635	Identification of genes responsive to salt stress on Tamarix hispida roots	Plant roots are the primary site of perception and injury for salinity stress. In order to characterize the complexity of adaptation to salty environments in roots of Tamarix hispida, a woody halophyte, expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis was performed. Three cDNA libraries were generated from root tissues of T. hispida that were exposed to 0.4 M NaCl for 0 (control), 24 and 48 h. A total of 7726 ESTs were generated from the three libraries, and were assembled into 1142 contigs and 3026 singletons. EST analysis was performed to compare gene expression in the three cDNA libraries. Ninety redundant unique transcripts responsive to NaCl treatment were identified. Of them, 21 genes were novel or of unknown function while others were involved in the functional activities, such as ROS scavenging, lipid metabolism, osmolyte biosynthesis, signal transduction, transport, lignin synthesis and homeostasis. The genes, including those for metallothionein-like protein, polyubiquitin, hypothetical protein, and glycine-rich cell wall structural protein, were abundant in the libraries and showed obvious up-regulation after NaCl treatments, suggesting important roles in NaCl tolerance. The results of this study may contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism of salt tolerance in the roots of plants. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

80052514479	A systemic proteomic analysis of Populus chloroplast by using shotgun method	The chloroplast is one of the most important organelles in plants. Proteomic investigations of chloroplasts have been undertaken for many herb plant species, but to date no such investigation has been reported for woody plant chloroplasts. In the present study we initiated a systematic proteomic study of Populus chloroplasts using a shotgun proteomic method. After isolation of chloroplasts and tryptic digestion of the proteins, the protein fragments were separated via HPLC using an SCX column, and the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS; 119 proteins were successfully identified. Based on annotation information in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, these proteins were identified as being localized in the chloroplast thylakoid membrane, chloroplast stroma, chloroplast thylakoid lumen, and plastoglobules. Over 50% of all identified proteins were confirmed as chloroplast thylakoid proteins, and 85 are encoded by the chloroplast genome with the remaining proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. Based on functional annotation, these proteins were classified into four functional categories, including photosynthesis, redox regulation and stress, primary and secondary metabolism, transport and signaling. These data provide a valuable basis for further studies on photosynthesis in poplar species.

84861785288	Selection of the optimum fertilizer formula and the effects of nutrient elements on growth and flowering performance of Betula platyphylla	Three fertilizer formulae (T1, T2 and T3) of various nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels were applied to 1-, 2- and 3-year-old Betula platyphylla seedlings of a half-sib family, respectively, with the objectives of comparing their effects on seedling flowering and fruiting and selecting the optimum one. Then, we investigated the effects of each element (N, P and K) of the optimum formula on growth and development of B. platyphylla seedlings. Results showed that: 1) all formulae significantly increased flowering, compared with no fertilizer (control), with the great response occurring at T3. 2) In T3, nitrogen was most effective in improving vegetative growth, making the 3-year-old trees reach 3.08 m in height and 25.76 mm in ground diameter, increased by 19.38% and 39.17% respectively than control. 3) Nitrogen fertilizer promoted flowering more effectively than phosphorus or potassium fertilizer. Applying nitrogen improved the flowering rate of 3-year-old trees to 49%, compared with only 4%, 1%, and 0 by applying only phosphorus, potassium or without fertilizer. However, applying T3 produced significantly more flowers than applying nitrogen alone, increasing the flowering rate to 90%; 4) During the development from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, some nutrition was allocated for reproductive growth, which reduced the height growth but not diameter growth of the current year.

84877865482	Overexpression of a MADS-Box Gene from Birch (Betula platyphylla) Promotes Flowering and Enhances Chloroplast Development in Transgenic Tobacco	In this study, a MADS-box gene (BpMADS), which is an ortholog of AP1 from Arabidopsis, was isolated from birch (Betula platyphylla). Transgenic Arabidopsis containing a BpMADS promoter::GUS construct was produced, which exhibited strong GUS staining in sepal tissues. Ectopic expression of BpMADS significantly enhanced the flowering of tobacco (35S::BpMADS). In addition, the chloroplasts of transgenic tobacco exhibited much higher growth and division rates, as well rates of photosynthesis, than wild-type. A grafting experiment demonstrated that the flowering time of the scion was not affected by stock that overexpressed BpMADS. In addition, the overexpression of BpMADS resulted in the upregulation of some flowering-related genes in tobacco. © 2013 Qu et al.

84888014448	Proteomic Analysis Points to a Role for RAD23 in Apical Dominance in Pinus sylvestris var. Mongolica	In higher plants, apical dominance is the phenomenon whereby the main central stem is dominant over other side stems. In the present study, the natural loss of apical dominance in a Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica mutant was characterized. The mutant lacked an obvious trunk, but exhibited a large number of side stems, short internodes and leaves, and dwarfism. Cell biological analyses indicated that the meristem was changed dramatically in the mutant, with irregular cell arrangements, and no obvious layers of meristem and mature tissue. The loss of apical dominance in the mutant plant was accompanied by a significant decrease in auxin (A) and cytokinin (C) content compared to wild type, and increased C/A values. Proteomic analysis of the apical buds using 2DE-ESI-MS/MS at different stages of development (including dormancy, bud break, 10 days after bud break, and 15 days after bud break) revealed 49 proteins that were significantly changed in abundance compared to wild type. These proteins were involved in stress response, energy production and conversion, post-translation modification and amino acid transport and metabolism, as well as many other complex biological processes. Among the identified proteins, Rad23, an abscisic acid- and stress-induced protein, and cytoplasmic aconitate hydratase likely participate in ABA responses, Fe

84897974529	Family selection of birch tetraploid half-sibling based on seed vigor and seedling growth traits	In this experiment, we compared tetraploid-and diploid-families of birch in seed and seedling quality. Seeds of 23 half-sib families (18 tetraploid-and 5 diploid-families) were collected from a seed orchard and their seedlings were grown in a nursery. The measured traits included thousand-seed weight, germination potential, germination rate, vigor index, seedling height and ground diameter. The results showed that: there were significant (P < 0.01) family effects for all studied traits. On average, the thousand-seed weight of triploid-families was 22.42% higher than that of diploid-families. While the tetraploid Q53 half-sibling family showed the highest germination potential (56.67%) and vigor index (37.62), all other tetraploid-families displayed lower values than diploid ones. For seedling height, the diploid-families were taller than the tetraploid ones; the top three families were all diploid-families and the tallest one, the diploid-family CK1, was 31.04% higher than other families. The ground diameter growth, however, showed a reversal pattern, with most of the top-ranking families being tetraploid-families. Based on the results of principal component analysis, tetraploid-families Q53, Q65, Q13 and Q27 were identified as the superior families. We recommend the seed trees of these families as preferred seed trees in the future establishment of triploid seed production gardens.

Induction of ThCAP gene was not only responsive to different stress conditions but was also organ specific. When transgenic Populus (P. davidiana × P. bolleana) plants were generated, expressing ThCAP under regulation of the cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV 35S promoter, they had a greater resistance to low temperature than non-transgenic seedlings, suggesting that ThCAP might play an important role in cold tolerance. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Using gel-free (in-solution) protein digestion and phosphopeptide enrichment combined with a nanoUPLC-ESI-MS/MS strategy, we identified six phosphorylation sites on eight P-proteins from Populus dormant terminal buds. Among these, six Ser sites and one Thr site were identified in the highly conserved C-terminal region of eight P-proteins of various P-protein subfamilies, including two P0, two P1, three P2 and one P3 protein. Among these, the Thr site was shown to be novel and has not been identified in any other organisms. Sequence analysis indicated that the phosphothreonine sites identified in the C-terminus of Ptr RPP2A exclusively occurred in woody species of Populus, etc. The identified phosphopeptides shared a common phosphorylation motif of (S/T)XX(D/E) and may be phosphorylated in vivo by casein kinase 2 as suggested by using Scansite analysis. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis suggested that divergence of P2 also occurred in Populus, including type I and type II. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic phosphoproteomic and phylogenetic analysis of P-proteins in woody plants, the results of which will provide a wealth of resources for future understanding and unraveling of the regulatory mechanisms of Populus P-protein phosphorylation during the maintenance of dormancy. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

77950870073	Enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic poplar plants expressing a manganese superoxide dismutase from Tamarix androssowii	Superoxide dismutases (SODs) play important role in stress tolerance of plants. In this study, an MnSOD gene (TaMnSOD) from Tamarix androssowii, under the control of the CaMV35S promoter, was introduced into poplar (Populus davidiana 9 P. bolleana). The physiological parameters, including SOD activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrical conductivity (REC) and relative weight gain, of transgenic lines and wild type (WT) plants, were measured and compared. The results showed that SOD activity was enhanced in transgenic plants, and the MDA content and REC were significantly decreased compared to WT plants when exposed to NaCl stress. In addition, the relative weight gains of the transgenic plants were 8- to 23-fold of those observed for WT plants after NaCl stress for 30 days. The data showed that the SOD activities that increased in transgenic lines are 1.3-4-folds of that increased in the WT plant when exposed to NaCl stress. Our analysis showed that increases in SOD activities as low as 0.15-fold can also significantly enhance salt tolerance in transgenic plants, suggesting an important role of increased SOD activity in plant salt tolerance. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

77951933563	ThPOD3, a truncated polypeptide from Tamarix hispida, conferred drought tolerance in Escherichia coli	The ThPOD1 gene encodes a peroxidase and was isolated from a Tamarix hispida NaCl-stress root cDNA library. We found that ThPOD1 expression could be induced by abiotic stresses such as cold, salt, drought and exogenous abscisic acid. These findings suggested that ThPOD1 might be involved in the plant response to environmental stresses and ABA treatment. To elucidate the function of this gene, recombinant plasmids expressing full-length ThPOD1 as well as ThPOD2 (aa 41-337), and ThPOD3 (aa 73-337) truncated polypeptides were constructed. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses of the fusion proteins revealed that the molecular weights of ThPOD1, ThPOD2 and ThPOD3 were ̃57, ̃50 and ̃47 kDa, respectively. Stress assays of E. coli treated with the recombinant plasmids indicated that ThPOD3 could improve resistance to drought stress. This finding could potentially be used to improve plant tolerance to drought stress via gene transfer. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

In this work, a cDNA clone which encodes a copper-zinc superoxide dismutase gene, named PS-CuZnSOD, has been identified from P. sibiricum Laxm. by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (RACE). Analysis of the nucleotide sequence reveals that the PS-CuZnSOD gene cDNA clone consists of 669 bp, containing 87 bp in the 5' untranslated region; 459 bp in the open reading frame (ORF) encoding 152 amino acids; and 123 bp in 3' untranslated region.

(Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) to a fusion gene consisting of the spider, Atrax robustus Simon (Araneae: Hexanthelidae) ω-ACTX-Ar1 sequence coding for an ω-atracotoxin and a sequence coding for the Bt-toxin C-peptide, expressed in transgenic poplar Populus simonii x P. nigra L. (Malphigiales: Salicaceae) was investigated. Individual performance, feeding selection, midgut proteinase activity and nutrition utilization were monitored. The growth and development of L. dispar were significantly affected by continually feeding on the transgenic poplar, with the larval instars displaying significantly shorter developmental times than those fed on nontransgenic poplar, but pupation was delayed. Mortality was higher in populations fed transgenic poplar leaves, than for larvae fed nontransgenic poplar leaves. The cumulative mortality during all stages of larvae fed transgenic leaves was 92% compared to 16.7% of larvae on nontransgenic leaves. The highest mortality observed was 71.7% in the last larval instar stage. A two-choice test showed that fifth-instar larvae preferred to feed on nontransgenic leaves at a ratio of 1:1.4. Feeding on transgenic leaves had highly significant negative effects on relative growth of larvae, and the efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food. Activity of major midgut proteinases was measured using substrates TAME and BTEE showed significant increases in tryptase and chymotrypsinlike activity (9.2- and 9.0-fold, respectively) in fifth-instar larvae fed on transgenic leaves over control. These results suggest transgenic poplar is resistant to L. dispar, and the mature L. dispar may be weakened by the transgenic plants due to Bt protoxins activated by elevated major midgut proteinase activity. The new transgenic poplar expressing fusion protein genes of Bt and a new spider insecticidal peptide are good candidates for managing gypsy moth.

80054687231	Temporal expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins in birch (Betula Platyphylla)	Gibberellins (GAs) are a large family of endogenous plant growth regulators. Bioactive GAs influence nearly all processes during plant growth and development. In the present study, we cloned and identified 10 unique genes that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of GAs, including one BpGGDP gene, two BpCPS genes, one BpKS gene, two BpKO genes, three BpGA20ox genes and one BpGA2ox gene. The temporal expression of these 10 genes in birch was analyzed during a one-year growth cycle by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results show that their expression patterns were individually distinct throughout the one-year growth cycle. Three BpGA20ox genes, which are potential limiting factors of bioactive GA biosynthesis, displayed differential expression patterns during the course of the experiment. This study provides insights into the roles of genes involved in the biosynthesis of GAs during the early development of birch. © 2011 Academic Journals.

80255129328	Time-Course Analysis of Levels of Indole-3-Acetic Acid and Expression of Auxin-Responsive GH3 Genes in Betula platyphylla	Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is a natural hormone that plays an important role in the essential physiological processes of plant growth, development, and environmental response. To maintain IAA homeostasis in plants, some members of the GH3 gene family may mediate the conjugation of amino acids to indole-3-acetic acid. In this study, nine birch BpGH3 genes were cloned, including three BpGH3.5 genes, three BpGH3.6 genes, two BpGH3.9 genes, and a single BpGH3.3 gene, that were likely to be auxin-responsive genes. Time-course expression analysis of these nine BpGH3 genes using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted using birch plant tissues collected during a 1-year growth cycle. Further, we determined the endogenous free IAA content in birch during this period by using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that the IAA levels changed remarkably throughout the study period; the level remained relatively stable during the developmental stage from June 1 to July 1, and IAA was present in the birch leaves throughout the study period. The correlation between the expression of BpGH3 genes and IAA levels was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. The results revealed a significant negative correlation between the expressions of four BpGH3 genes, namely, BpGH3.3 (p < 0.05), BpGH3.5a (p < 0.01), BpGH3.5b (p < 0.01), and BpGH3.9a (p < 0.01) and the free IAA level, thereby suggesting that these genes might play roles in IAA regulation. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

80255138868	Influence of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium Fertilization on Flowering and Expression of Flowering-Associated Genes in White Birch (Betula platyphylla Suk.)	Fertilization treatments can promote the growth and development of tree plants. In the present study, we evaluated the combined effects of different doses of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium on the blossoming and the expression of five flowering-associated genes, including BpMADS1, BpMADS3, BpMADS5, BpSPL1, and BpSPL2. The results showed that balanced NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium) fertilization cannot only promote the transition from juvenility to maturity but also can increase the inflorescence production of white birch. Furthermore, some fertilizing treatments not only increase the expression levels of all the five flowering-associated genes, but also change their expression patterns during the growth season. These results indicated that NPK fertilization have remarkable effects on flowering of white birch. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84856080992	Molecular Cloning and Expression Analysis of 13 MADS-Box Genes in Betula platyphylla	MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors that control a diverse range of processes in flowering plants. In this study, 13 unique MADS genes were cloned from Betula platyphylla Suk., and 2-year-old Betula seedlings propagated in glasshouses were selected as plant materials. The expression profile of each BpMADS was investigated during the growth season and following gibberellin (GA) treatments by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relative abundance of the 13 BpMADS was shown to differ during each month, indicating that the activity of the genes varies during the annual growing period. Expression analyses demonstrated that these BpMADS were regulated by GA signaling pathways. Furthermore, the variations in expression patterns suggest that the genes act independently to fulfill specific functions or act cooperatively in physiological processes. The study of birch MADSs is important for the purposes of improving breeding techniques and molecular biotechnology. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84858993890	Genome-wide analysis of a TaLEA-introduced transgenic populus simonii × populus nigra dwarf mutant	A dwarf mutant (dwf1) was obtained among 15 transgenic lines, when TaLEA (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant gene) was introduced into Populus simonii × Populus nigra by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. Because only one transgenic line (dwf1) displayed the dwarf phenotype, we considered that T-DNA insertion sites may play a role in the mutant formation. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated using TAIL-PCR (thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR) and microarrays methods. According to the TAIL-PCR results, two flanking sequences located on chromosome IV and VIII respectively, were cloned. The results indicated the integration of two independent T-DNA copies. We searched for the potential genes near to the T-DNA insertions. The nearest gene was a putative poplar AP2 transcription factor (GI: 224073210). Expression analysis showed that AP2 was up-regulated in dwf1 compared with the wild type and the other transgenic lines. According to the microarrays results, a total of 537 genes involved in hydrolase, kinase and transcription factor activities, as well as protein and nucleotide binding, showed significant alterations in gene expression. These genes were expressed in more than 60 metabolic pathways, including starch, sucrose, galactose and glycerolipid metabolism and phenylpropanoids and flavonoid biosyntheses. Our transcriptome and T-DNA insertion sites analyses might provide some useful insights into the dwarf mutant formation. © 2012 by the authors.

84862753210	The salt-responsive transcriptome of Populus simonii×Populus nigra via DGE	In this study, the dynamic transcriptome of poplar (Populus simonii× Populus nigra) was investigated under salt stress using Solexa/illumine digital gene expression (DGE) technique. A total of 5453, 2372, and 1770 genes were shown to be differentially expressed after exposure to NaCl for 3. days, 6. days and 9. days, respectively. Differential expression patterns throughout salt stress were identified for 572 genes. Gene ontology classification analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed that numerous genes mapped to "transporter activity" and "response to stress". The dynamic transcriptome expression profiles of poplar under salt stress obtained in this study may provide useful insights for further analysis of the mechanism of high salinity tolerance in plants. Furthermore, these differentially expressed genes under salt stress may allow identification of potential genes as suitable targets for biotechnological manipulation with the aim of improving poplar salt tolerance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84863031155	Expression, purification and characterization of a peroxidase from Tamarix hispida	Peroxidase is one of the key enzymes of the cellular antioxidant defense system, which is mostly involved in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. Here, a peroxidase gene, named ThPOD1 was isolated from a cDNA library, which was generated from root tissue of Tamarix hispida that was exposed to 0.4 M NaCl. The cDNA was subcloned in bacterial expression vector pET28a and expressed as N-terminal histidine tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli (Rosetta gami). After induction with IPTG, a molecular weight of 42 kDa fusion protein was obtained and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. New Zealand white rabbit was immunized with the purified ThPOD1 protein and the antiserum was obtained. Western blot analyses showed that, the antibody reacted specifically to recombinant ThPOD1 protein. Therefore, the antibody was applied to detect expression of ThPOD1 protein in T. hispida, which was treated with 20% PEG and 100 μM ABA, respectively. All treatments induced an increase in protein level of the ThPOD1 gene, especially the expression levels of ThPOD1 in roots were obviously higher than in leaves. This work established a good foundation for further study on the specific function of ThPOD1 under the condition of abiotic stress. © 2012 Academic Journals.

84863272462	Expression analysis of MYC genes from Tamarix hispida in response to different abiotic stresses	The MYC genes are a group of transcription factors containing both bHLH and ZIP motifs that play important roles in the regulation of abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive genes. In the present study, to investigate the roles of MYC genes under NaCl, osmotic and ABA stress conditions, nine MYC genes were cloned from Tamarix hispida. Real-time reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR showed that all nine MYC genes were expressed in root,stem and leaf tissues, but that the levels of the transcripts of these genes in the various tissues differed notably. The MYC genes were highly induced in the roots in response to ABA, NaCl and osmotic stresses after 3 h; however, in the stem and leaf tissues, MYC genes were highly induced only when exposed to these stresses for 6 h. In addition, most of these MYC genes were highly expressed in roots in comparison with stems and leaves. Furthermore, the MYC genes were more highly induced in roots than in stem and leaf tissues, indicating that these genes may play roles in stress responses mainly in the roots rather than the stems and leaves. The results of this present study suggest that MYCs are involved in salt and osmotic stress tolerances and are controlled by the ABA signal transduction pathway. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84863108446	Overexpression of a heat shock protein (ThHSP18.3) from Tamarix hispida confers stress tolerance to yeast	It is well known that plant heat shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles both in response to adverse environmental conditions and in various developmental processes. However, among plant HSPs, the functions of tree plant HSPs are poorly characterized. To improve our understanding of tree HSPs, we cloned and characterized an HSP gene (ThHSP18.3) from Tamarix hispida. Sequence alignment reveals that ThHSP18.3 belongs to the class I small heat shock protein family. A transient expression assay showed that ThHSP18.3 protein was targeted to the cell nucleus. Treatment of Tamarix hispida with cold and heat shock highly induced ThHSP18.3 expression in all studied leaves, roots and stems, whereas, treatment of T. hispida with NaCl, NaHCO

84863817167	Time-course analyses of abscisic acid level and the expression of genes involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis in the leaves of Betula platyphylla	Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant hormone regulating the essential physiological processes of plants and plant responses to various environmental stresses. Recent studies revealed that the key enzymes involved in ABA biosynthesis were zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCED), short-chain dehydrogenase/ reductase (SDR), and ABA-aldehyde oxidase (AAO). In this study, we cloned 12 unique genes potentially involved in ABA synthesis, including 5 of BpNCEDs, 1 of BpAAO, and 6 of BpZEPs from birch leaves. We analyzed the time-course expression of these 12 genes during the phase from May to August by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, we determined birch endogenous ABA content during this period by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results indicated that ABA level significantly (P < 0.05) increased during the early stages of development and ABA was present in birch leaves throughout the studied period, suggesting that endogenous ABA is necessary for the normal growth and development of plants. The correlation between the expression of above-mentioned genes and ABA levels was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. The results revealed that the expression of three genes, namely, BpNCED4, BpNCED5 and BpZE6 significantly (P<0.05) correlated with the ABA level. Therefore, these three genes may play important roles in ABA biosynthesis. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

Among the 15 transgenic lines, one showed a dwarf phenotype (dwf1). Under the same growth conditions, dwf1 height was significantly reduced compared with the wild-type and the other transgenic lines. The mechanisms underlying this effect were investigated in mutant and wild-type plants using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Among proteins that identified, 99 were significantly altered. With the exception of proteins with unidentified or unclassified functions, these proteins were classified into eight groups based on gene product subcellular localization and biological process (metabolism, stress, protein synthesis and degradation, transcrip-tional regulation, cell fate, transportation, cell wall, and cytoskeleton). Differential expression patterns were identified for key enzymes involved in major metabolic pathways such as the Calvin cycle and glycolysis, thus indicating the interplay of complex molecular events in generation of the dwf1 mutant. Overall, the differentially expressed proteins in dwf1 might provide some useful insights into the dwarf formation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

84865267997	Seed vigor, photosynthesis and early growth of saplings of different triploid Betula families	Breeding scientists have given extensive attention to triploids in trees because of their importance to forestry. Consequently, creating and breeding triploids of good quality has become one of purposes of tree breeding. We chose two autotetraploids (Betula platyphylla, namedQ10 andQ65) as female parents andeight hybrid diploids (B. platyphylla × B. pendula, namedF1 - F8) as male parents to obtain progenies through controllable pollination, resulting in triploidprogenies. Germination rate andgermination energy of triploid seeds of Q65 were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in triploidseed s of Q10. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent hada large quantity of saplings, whereas triploidfamilies with Q10 as female parent hada small quantity of saplings. Triploidfamilies with Q65 as female parent were generally superior in base diameter and height to base diameter ratio when compared to a diploid family. Q65×F3 was preliminarily recognized as the superior family. These results demonstrate that the female parent has a major influence on triploid progenies, although the male parent also has a small influence. The results provided a reference to build seed orchards of triploid birch trees, choose tetraploids as female parents and forecast triploid families of good quality.

0036868561	Feasibility to introduce rare tree species Pinus sibirica into China	Pinus sibirica growing mainly in Siberia of Russia is distributed over the Euro-Asia Taiga forest belt. There are many high-quality populations due to a great deal of variations. This kind of tree has an advantage of standing up to frigid environment, and can spread out in such places that have cold weather and high altitude. In China, boreal forest is a wide-spreaded type of forest that has the largest area and high volume. For this reason, it is feasible to introduce Pinus sibirica into the region that the condition is suitable. Introducing this kind of tree is a strategic project that can improve the structure and quality of our boreal forest. Introducing it can not only meet the demands of improved variety in short time, but also do the experiment of producing edible seeds and build up the developing center of nut, which can be a way of getting rid of poverty of forest region in heavy frigid area where is regarded as infertile area for farming formerly.

In comparison with stable transformation, it has the advantages of being simple, quick, economical, and effective. In the present study, we developed a novel transient gene expression system based on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. This system is simple and convenient and allows for high transient expression levels. Hyperosmotic pretreatment of plants significantly improved the transient expression in this system. Furthermore, other factors, including acetosyringone concentration, cocultivation time, and Agrobacterium cell density, significantly influenced transient expression efficiency. The results showed that this method is suitable for use with herbaceous plants (such as tobacco and Arabidopsis) and trees (such as birch, poplar, tamarisk, cork, willow, and aralia), suggesting that it may be applied widely in plant transient expression studies. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

84867950087	Growth traits of triploid progenies in one year old from different crosses of Betula platyphylla Suk	Triploid progenies of 20 crosses were obtained by controlled-pollination using four autotetraploid Betula platyphylla (Q14, Q19, Q33 and Q34) as female and five diploid hybrid B. platyphylla × B. pendula (Ml, M2, M3, M4 and M5) as male and tested in a nursery. This paper presents early growth measurements and the results indicat that cross had a significant effect on height and base diameter growth. Variances of general combining ability and specific combining ability for both height and base diameter were significantly different from zero. Based on the results of growth, general combining ability and specific combining ability, two autotetraploids (Q19 and Q34) were identified as good female parents, two diploid hybrids (M1 and M2) as male parents, and Q34 × M2 and Q34 × M1 as the best crosses.

84867783535	Transcriptomic analysis of phenotypic changes in birch (Betula platyphylla) autotetraploids	Plant breeders have focused much attention on polyploid trees because of their importance to forestry. To evaluate the impact of intraspecies genome duplication on the transcriptome, a series of Betula platyphylla autotetraploids and diploids were generated from four full-sib families. The phenotypes and transcriptomes of these autotetraploid individuals were compared with those of diploid trees. Autotetraploids were generally superior in breast-height diameter, volume, leaf, fruit and stoma and were generally inferior in height compared to diploids. Transcriptome data revealed numerous changes in gene expression attributable to autotetraploidization, which resulted in the upregulation of 7052 unigenes and the downregulation of 3658 unigenes. Pathway analysis revealed that the biosynthesis and signal transduction of indoleacetate (IAA) and ethylene were altered after genome duplication, which may have contributed to phenotypic changes. These results shed light on variations in birch autotetraploidization and help identify important genes for the genetic engineering of birch trees. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Quantitative analysis of relative expression of the AP2/PthRAV lines in dwf1 was significantly higher than other transgenic lines, at 7.78 times of the average. A preliminary view of dwf1 lines in the change of growth and anatomical structure of leaf traits may be related to the up-regulation of AP2/PthRAV genes.

84875433913	LEA genes and drought tolerance	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are involved in protecting plants from damage induced by abiotic stress, particularly dehydration. These proteins are abundant at late embryogenesis stage and synthesized in the seeds of all higher plants during the later stages of development. As important drought-tolerance genes, the function of LEA proteins has been studied extensively. This paper summarizes the classification of LEA proteins, cloning of LEA genes, gene expression in response to water deficits and drought-tolerance mechanisms inherent in LEA proteins. In addition, this review demonstrates that LEA proteins are involved in several drought-tolerance pathways, including membrane stabilization, molecular chaperones, scavenging reactive oxygen species, sequestering ions, water replacement and the formation of stable glasses. The multiple roles of LEA genes in effective stress tolerance suggest that the genes possess substantial value in breeding drought-tolerant crops. © CAB International 2008.

The analysis of variance showed that there was a remarkable difference in H and BD among sites (P < 0.01), lines (P < 0.01), and sites × lines (P < 0.05). The average H and BD of transgenic poplar lines ranged in 128-235 cm and 13-24 mm in different sites respectively. The coefficients of H and BD of transgenic poplar lines changed in 19.84%-33.38% and 24.21%-49.16% and repeatabilities ranged in 0.497-0.952, indicating that the variation of poplar transgenic lines was strongly controlled by genetic factors, which were in favor of line selection. Tai model was introduced to analyse the genetic adaptability of poplar lines in different sites. The results showed that except line XL11, other lines grew steady in different sites. Based on the genetic adaptability parameter and the domino effect values of interaction between H and environment, the most adapted site of each line was predicted. Lines XL9, XL1 and XL14 are high biomass and strong stability, which are suitable generalized in 6 different sites.

84878073013	Inducing tetraploid of Betula platyphylla with different generations of seeds by colchicine	The effects of colchicine treatments on relative-germination rate and potential of seeds for four Betula platyphylla families were studied. The treatment combinations included the colchicine concentration of 0.1% and 0.2% and the treatment time of 1 day, 2, 3 and 4 days. Based on the results of first experiment, the second one was further to investigate the inducing rate of tetraploid after applying the treatment combination of 0.2% and 3 days on 7 families of two species, B. platyphylla × B. pendula and B. pendula. Results of the first experiment showed that the colchicine concentration had a significant influence on seed relative-germination rate and potential; the germinate rate was lower and potential was weaker at the concentration of 0.2% than at 0.1%. Under the same concentration, the relative-germination rate and potential reduced first then enhanced along with the increase of treating time. The treating time of 3 days had the lowest germinate rate and potential. Results of the second experiment showed that the tetraploid inducing rate was significantly different between the species and among the families within species. The average inducing rate was 3.76% for the four B. pendula families but was only 0.09% for the three hybrid families. The highest rate was 8.86% for YB3.

84879540663	Overexpression of TaLEA Gene from Tamarix androssowii Improves Salt and Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Poplar (Populus simonii × P. nigra)	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) genes were confirmed to confer resistance to drought and water deficiency. An LEA gene from Tamarix androssowii (named TaLEA) was transformed into Xiaohei poplar Populus simonii. Twenty-five independent transgenic lines were obtained that were resistant to kanamycin, and 11 transgenic lines were randomly selected for further analysis. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) gel blot indicated that the TaLEA gene had been integrated into the poplar genome. The height growth rate, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrolyte leakage and damages due to salt or drought to transgenic and non-transgenic plants were compared under salt and drought stress conditions. The results showed that the constitutive expression of the TaLEA gene in transgenic poplars could induce an increase in height growth rate and a decrease in number and severity of wilted leaves under the salt and drought stresses. The MDA content and relative electrolyte leakage in transgenic lines under salt and drought stresses were significantly lower compared to those in non-transgenic plants, indicating that the TaLEA gene may enhance salt and drought tolerance by protecting cell membranes from damage. Moreover, amongst the lines analyzed for stress tolerance, the transgenic line 11 (T11) showed the highest tolerance levels under both salinity and drought stress conditions. These results indicated that the TaLEA gene could be a salt and drought tolerance candidate gene and could confer a broad spectrum of tolerance under abiotic stresses in poplars. © 2013 Gao et al.

However, their exact roles in abiotic stress tolerance are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated a working model for the function of a WRKY gene (ThWRKY4) from Tamarix hispida in the stress response. ThWRKY4 is highly induced by abscisic acid (ABA), salt and drought in the early period of stress (stress for 3, 6, or 9 h), which can be regulated by ABF (ABRE binding factors) and Dof (DNA binding with one finger), and also can be crossregulated by other WRKYs and autoregulated as well.

84884939315	The bZIP protein from Tamarix hispida, ThbZIP1, is ACGT elements binding factor that enhances abiotic stress signaling in transgenic Arabidopsis	Background: Tamarix spp. are woody halophyte, which are very tolerant to abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought, but little is known about their specific stress response systems. Basic leucine zipper proteins (bZIPs) play important roles in the ability of plants to withstand adverse environmental conditions. However, their exact roles in abiotic stress tolerance are still not fully known. In the current study, we functionally characterized a bZIP gene (ThbZIP1) from Tamarix hispida in response to abiotic stresses.Results: We addressed the regulatory network of ThbZIP1 in three levels, i.e. its upstream regulators, the cis-acting elements recognized by ThbZIP1, and its downstream target genes. Two MYCs were found to bind to E-box, in the promoter of ThbZIP1 to activate its expression. Expression of ThbZIP1 is induced by ABA, salt, drought, methyl viologen and cold. ThbZIP1 can specifically bind to ACGT elements, with the highest binding affinity to the C-box, followed by the G-box and lastly the A-box. Compared with wild-type (Col-0) Arabidopsis, transgenic plants expressing ThbZIP1 had an increased tolerance to drought and salt, but had an increased sensitivity to ABA during seed germination and root growth; meanwhile, ROS level, cell death and water loss rate in transgenic plants were significantly reduced. Microarray analyses showed that many ROS scavenging genes were up-regulated by ThbZIP1 under salt stress conditions.Conclusions: Based on these data, we suggest that ThbZIP1 confers abiotic stress tolerance through activating stress tolerance genes to modulate ROS scavenging ability and other physiological changes involved in stress tolerance, and plays an important role in the ABA-mediated stress response of T. hispida. © 2013 Ji et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

To evaluate the impact of intraspecies leaf-shape variation on the transcriptome, a series of Betula pendula 'Dalecarlica' and B. pendula saplings were generated through tissue culture. The leaf shapes and transcriptomes of B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' clones were compared with those of B. pendula clones. The leaf shape of B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' was incised and that of B. pendula was ovate. Transcriptome data revealed numerous changes in gene expression between B. pendula 'Dalecarlica' and B. pendula, including upregulation of 8767 unigenes and downregulation of 8379 unigenes in B. pendula 'Dalecarlica'. A pathway analysis revealed that the transport and signal transduction of auxin were altered in 'Dalecarlica', which may have contributed to its altered leaf shape.

A F1 segregating population including 80 progenies was obtained from the cross between two superior trees selected from Qinghai and Wangqing provenance, respectively. The paternal map was constructed with 282 markers consisting of 14 major and 15 minor (5 triplets and 10 doublets) linkage groups and spanning 1131 cM at an average distance of 4.0 cM between adjacent markers. The maternal map has 277 markers consisting of 15 major and 8 minor (5 triplets and 3 doublets) groups covering 1288 cM at an average distance of 4.6 cM between adjacent markers. In the same pedigree we investigated association of genetic markers with seedling stem height and circumference. The composite interval mapping was used to detect the number of quantitative trait loci and their position on the genetic linkage maps. Three QTLs (one on the male map and two on the female map) were found explaining 13.4%, 17.5% and 18.8% of the trait variation, respectively.

Easy propagation by cutting has made most of the selected genotypes of poplar available for intensive plantation with large genetic gains. Critical point for successful propagation of cutting is the development of roots. Thus, rooting context of the cutting appeared to be a pivotal scenario in poplar vegetative propagations. In this overview, we focus on the progress in defining the genetic, physical, chemical and environmental factors that influences the poplar cuttings to develop adventitious roots. These factors include genotype effect, physiological conditions of the stock plants, plant growth regulators, temperature, rooting substrates/media as major variables for the development of rooting events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84901554022	Analysis of genetic effects on a complete diallel cross test of Betula platyphylla	The study utilized the offspring of a 5 × 5 diallel cross of Betula platyphylla as the experimental material. Tree height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH) and stem straight degree (SSD) were measured at the fourth and eighth growth year (SSD were measured only in the eighth growth year). ANOVA analyses showed that growth traits in different growth years were significant among families (P < 0.01). There existed extremely significant correlations between H and DBH in the same year. Although the sequencing of average H and DBH of different families were vicissitudinous at the 4th and 8th year, there also existed significant correlations between H and DBH in different year. The general combining ability, special combining ability (SCA) and reciprocal effect (REC) of different hybridized combinations were also different remarkably. The mean square of SCA was significantly higher than GCA, implied that the non-additive effect played major roles. When B5, B8 and MB15 were selected as parents, the offspring performed perfectly in traits of H, DBH and SSD at the eighth growth year respectively. B5 × XB11, B8 × XB11 and B8 × MB15 had highest SCA values in traits of H, DBH, and SSD at the eighth growth year respectively. Consequently, in order to achieve optimal outcomes, seed orchard building and clonal propagation should be considered simultaneously in birch's genetic improvement process. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

84905028276	Overexpression of BpAP1 induces early flowering and produces dwarfism in Betula platyphylla × Betula pendula	The involvement of APETALA1 (AP1) in the flowering transition has been the focus of much research. Here, we produced Betula platyphylla × Betula pendula (birch) lines that overexpressed BpAP1 using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation; we obtained five independent 35S::BpAP1 transgenic lines. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Southern, northern and western analyses were used to identify the transformants. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), BpAP1 expression in roots, shoots, leaves and terminal buds of 35S::BpAP1 transgenic lines was significantly higher than that in the wild type (WT, P < 0.01). The average height of 2-year-old 35S::BpAP1 plants was significantly lower (41.17%) than that of non-transgenic plants. In the 35S::BpAP1 lines, inflorescences emerged successively beginning 2 months after transplanting. In addition, the length-diameter ratio of fully developed male and female inflorescences were both significantly less than those of the WT (P < 0.05), i.e. the morphological characteristic was stubby. The male inflorescences emerged early, with empty, draped anthers, and pollen was rarely produced, whereas the female floret structure was not different from WT. The pistils developed normally and could accept pollen, leading to the production of hybrid progeny (F

84908325481	Comparative genomic analysis of transgenic poplar dwarf mutant reveals numerous differentially expressed genes involved in energy flow	In our previous research, the Tamarix androssowii LEA gene (Tamarix androssowii late embryogenesis abundant protein Mrna, GenBank ID: DQ663481) was transferred into Populus simonii × Populus nigra. Among the eleven transgenic lines, one exhibited a dwarf phenotype compared to the wild type and other transgenic lines, named dwf1. To uncover the mechanisms underlying this phenotype, digital gene expression libraries were produced from dwf1, wild-type, and other normal transgenic lines, XL-5 and XL-6. Gene expression profile analysis indicated that dwf1 had a unique gene expression pattern in comparison to the other two transgenic lines. Finally, a total of 1246 dwf1-unique differentially expressed genes were identified. These genes were further subjected to gene ontology and pathway analysis. Results indicated that photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism related genes were significantly affected. In addition, many transcription factors genes were also differentially expressed in dwf1. These various differentially expressed genes may be critical for dwarf mutant formation; thus, the findings presented here might provide insight for our understanding of the mechanisms of tree growth and development.

84919931860	Improved salt tolerance of Populus davidiana × P. bolleana overexpressed LEA from Tamarix androssowii	Development of transgenic plants with tolerance to environmental stress is an important goal of plant biotechnology. Late-embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins accumulate in seeds during late embryogenesis, where they protect cellular membranes and macromolecules against drought. In this work, we transferred the Tamarix androssowii LEA gene into hybrids of Populus davidiana×P. bolleana. We compared relative rates of height growth, chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters, and leaf Na+ levels of six TaLEA-containing lines with non-transferred plants (NT), all grown under 0.8% NaCl stress condition. Survival percentages of transgenic lines were all higher than for NT controls after rehydration and the survival percentage of SL2 was five-fold higher than for NT controls. Seedling height increased 48.7% in SL2 (from the onset of induced stress to the end of the growing season), 31% more than for the NT controls. Chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters showed a marked increase in photosynthetic capacity in SL2 and SL5. Na+ levels in young leaves of transgenic lines were lower than in control NT leaves, but higher in yellow and withered leaves, indicating improved salt tolerance in transgenic lines.
