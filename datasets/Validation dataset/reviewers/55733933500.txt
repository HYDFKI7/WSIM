23944440984	Simulation analysis of cooling capacity in mold during LPDC of magnesium wheel	The cooling performance at the key regions of mold during the low pressure die casting (LPDC) of magnesium wheel was investigated. Through analyzing the shrinkage defects generated under the conditions of various cooling modes, it was found the cooling pipe system set in the side mold alone is a valid way to enhance the cooling capacity at the rim/spoke junction areas. The mode can lower the generation of hot spots at the junctions, so the shrinkage defects at these regions are limited obviously. Furthermore, the statics analysis was carried out to compare the distribution of stress and strain between the former and current product. The result shows the cooling mode selected is effective.

33644643386	Application of decision tree algorithm in stamping process	Various process parameters exert different effects in stamping process. In order to study the relationships among the process parameters of box stamping process, including the blank holder force, friction coefficient, depth of drawbead, offset and length of drawbead, the decision tree algorithm C4.5 was performed to generate the decision tree using the result data of the box stamping simulation. The design and improvement methods of the decision tree were presented. Potential and valuable rules were generated by traversing the decision tree, which plays an instructive role on the practical design. The rules show that the correct combination of blank holder force and setting of drawbead are the dominant contribution for controlling the cracking and wrinkling in box stamping process. In order to validate the rules, the stamping process for box was also performed. The experiment results show good agreement with the generated rules.

33845355098	Numerical simulation of low pressure die casting of magnesium alloy wheel	The simulation of low pressure die casting process of a magnesium alloy wheel was presented. Through calculating the temperature field and the velocity field during filling and solidification stages, the evolution of temperature and liquid fraction was analyzed. Then, the potential defects including the gas pores in the middle of the spokes, shrinkages at the top of the rim and the rim/spokes junctions were predicted. The reasons for these defects were also analyzed and the solutions to eliminate them were put forward. The air gas pores and the shrinkages at the top of the rim were eliminated effectively by reducing the pouring velocity. Furthermore, the cooling capacity at the rim/spokes junctions was also investigated. Through analyzing the shrinkage defects generated in various cooling modes, it is proven that the cooling pipe system set in the side mold alone is a valid way to enhance the cooling capacity at the rim/spoke junction areas.

Disks were cut from the heat-treated rods and processed by quasi-constrained high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature with an applied pressure of 6.0 GPa and torsional straining from 1/4 to 20 turns. The results show that there is a gradual evolution of homogeneity in microhardness and grain size with increasing numbers of revolutions in HPT such that the microhardness values attain a maximum constant value across the disk after processing by HPT for 10 turns and the measured equilibrium grain sizes after 20 turns are ~130 nm in Ti64-1 and ~70 in Ti64-2. The results show also that a larger fraction of lamellar (α + β) in the microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V leads to a higher hardenability after processing by HPT. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The proposed SOS approach has two improved and innovative results for the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI) method to Takagi-Sugeno(T-S) discrete fuzzy observer designs. Firstly, a polynomial discrete fuzzy model is developed, which is a generation of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. Secondly, the conditions in the proposed approach are obtained in terms of SOS, which is the extension of the LMI method. Therefore, the conditions given in this paper are more general than the existing LMI approaches to T-S fuzzy systems. An example is given to show the effectiveness, which also demonstrate the SOS approaches are more relaxed than the existing LMI approaches. Finally, a conclusion is given to complete the paper.

6344278264	Knowledge discovery from finite element simulation data	Knowledge-based engineering (KBE) and finite element analysis (FEA) have been used widely in sheet metal forming area. However, the acquisition of knowledge keeps bottleneck when building knowledge base in KBE. Also, to properly understand the results of the FEA and consequently choose the appropriate design, a lot of knowledge and experience are needed. FEA can generate massive data, in which large amounts of usefully implicit knowledge is hidden. Thus, knowledge acquisition from them is prospective to ease the above difficulties by applying Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) technology. In this study, the characteristics of the FEA data are discussed firstly. Then a framework of knowledge discovery from FEA data is proposed. Correspondingly, a data-mining algorithm named fuzzy-rough algorithm is developed to deal with the FEA simulation data. Finally, the stamping process of a square-cup part was studied as an example. The proposed knowledge discovery process is applied to obtain some useful, implicit production rules with efficiency measure.

The results show that high strain rate explosive loading induces a large amount of deformation twins in tungsten particles. The twining deformation after armour-piercing induces lots of micro-cracks and these micro-cracks extend to connect with the W-W interface fracture, becoming macro-cracks due to the tensile stress.

These two alloys were processed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature under an applied pressure of 6.0. GPa. Both materials showed increases in the microhardness and decreases in the grain size after HPT with a stabilization after about 10 turns. Higher hardness values and smaller grain sizes were attained in Ti64-2 thereby demonstrating that greater grain refinement is achieved when processing an alloy with approximately equal volume fractions of the constituent phases. In these experiments, the measured equilibrium grain sizes after 20 turns of HPT were ~130. nm in Ti64-1 and ~70. nm in Ti64-2. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A new hybrid nonlinear NCSs model based on the PCGSHF is constructed, in which both the network-induced delay and the packet dropouts are considered in the transmission. By using a novel multi-datum point parameter method, the obtained NCSs model is divided into two parts, which are related to the given multi-datum point parameters and the bound uncertain multi-datum points, respectively. Correspondingly, the design of in-finite PCGSHF can be achieved by giving finite multi-datum points. For handling the nonlinear term in system model, an effective norm bounded method is proposed based on the number of segments of PCGSHF. Next, the system stability is investigated based on Lyapunov theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. Then, both the PCGSHF and networked feedback controller for guaranteeing the stability condition are designed. Moreover, a stability criterion based on maximum allowable network-induced delay rate is proposed for choosing a reasonable sampling period.

In particular, some existing fuzzy Lyapunov functions and non-PDC control schemes are special cases of the new Lyapunov function and fuzzy control scheme, respectively. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 IEEE.

84877024144	Quantized Control Design for Coupled Dynamic Networks with Communication Constraints	This paper is concerned with the quantized synchronization control problem of coupled dynamic networks (CDNs) with communication constraints. The networked-induced delay, data packet dropouts, and signal quantization effects are simultaneously considered in the synchronization controller design. A new closed-loop coupled dynamic system is constructed, where both the interval time-varying delays and quantized parameters are taken into account. By using Kronecker product technique and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, a stability criterion is obtained for the closed-loop CDNs, which also guarantees that the CDNs are synchronized. Then, both the networked controller and the quantized parameters can be designed. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84878761540	Periodic feedback control for networked control systems with stochastic time-delay	For periodic feedback control problems of (NCSs) with stochastic time-delay, a novel Markovian stochastic time-delay system model is proposed. This model contains a piecewise constant generalized sampled-data hold function(PCGSHF) and a Markov chain, which is used to describe both the network-induced delay and packet dropouts. By using Lyapunov method and the linear matrix inequality(LMI) technique, the sufficient condition for ensuring the closed-loop NCSs stochastically stable is obtained. The design procedures of both the PCGSHF and the state feedback controller are also proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84879967678	Absolute stabilization of singular systems with ferromagnetic hysteresis nonlinearity	This paper is concerned with the absolute stabilization problem of a class of singular systems with feedback connected ferromagnetic hysteresis nonlinearities. Firstly, a novel differential-integral loop transformation framework is developed to achieve an augmented singular system model. Secondly, by constructing a new passive output derivative operator of hysteresis nonlinearity and establishing the bound condition of the solution of ferromagnetic hysteresis model, the equivalent absolute stability criterion of singular systems with hysteresis feedback is derived based on KYP method and LMIs technique. Furthermore, the strict LMIs conditions for absolute stabilization are obtained, which can easily be checked by the LMI toolbox in MATLAB.

84880460969	Thermo physical properties of copper/diamond composites fabricated by Spark Plasma Sintering	In modern electronic devices overheating has become a critical issue due to high power density and improved performance. In order to overcome this critical issue, the demands for materials having high thermal conductivity with low and tailorable coefficient of thermal expansions are required. This demand can be fulfilled by synthesizing copper/diamond composites, which show excellent thermo-physical properties, compatible with semiconductors and can be used in heat sink and thermal management applications. Copper/Diamond composites were fabricated by Spark Plasma Sintering Method (SPS) by electrolessly copper coated diamond particles pre coated with 1wt% Chromium. The prepared composites were investigated for various properties like thermal conductivity, thermal expansion and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (S.E.M) and X-ray diffraction (X.R.D) analyses. The effect of process parameters were also taken into account. Thermal conductivity of copper/diamond composites fabricated by SPS at 1100°C under pressure of 40MPa, obtained in this case was 400 W/m•K, which is quite higher than those heat sink materials being already in use. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84880863739	Relaxed global asymptotic stability of 2-D state-space digital filters described by Roesser model with polytopic-type uncertainty	The problem of stability analysis of 2-D state-space digital filters described by Roesser model with parameter uncertainty is addressed in this paper. The underlying parameter uncertainty is modeled by a convex bounded (polytope type) uncertain domain. By applying both a new parameter-dependent Lyapunov function and a kind of matrix transformation technique, relaxed global asymptotic stability criteria of the 2-D state-space digital filters are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be easily solved via standard numerical software. More importantly, the conservatism of the obtained global asymptotic stability criteria could be significantly reduced than existing ones. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The particles were characterized and the mechanism of product formation was investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS). The particle coating thickness was measured using optical micrographs. The diamond particles got uniform coating thickness of copper crystals layers.

84884588505	State estimation of recurrent neural networks with interval time-varying delay: An improved delay-dependent approach	This paper is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of recurrent neural networks with interval time-varying delay, where time delay includes either slow or fast time-varying delay. A novel delay-dependent criterion, in which the rate-range of time delay is also considered, is established to estimate the neuron states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible time delays, the dynamics of the estimation error system is globally asymptotically stable. The proposed method is based on a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with triple-integral terms and free-weighting matrix approach. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the method. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

84900806866	Control synthesis problem for networked linear sampled-data control systems with band-limited channels	This paper addresses the control synthesis problem of networked linear sampled-data control systems (NLSCSs) with band-limited channels. First, since there exist packet dropouts when the information is transmitted through the band-limited channels, a novel compression compensation (C-C) method is proposed to ensure the integrity of transmission. Based on this method, a compound control strategy is established to deal with the data transmission synchronization problem under the band-limited channels. Then, a nonlinear switched system model with uncertainty is constructed, in which both the inter-sampler behavior and the packet dropouts behavior are considered. Furthermore, some more general stability results of the NLSCSs with band-limited channels are obtained by using a packet dropouts dependent Lyapunov functional method, and then the compound state feedback controller can be designed. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The controllable electroless Ni plating process parameters are optimized. The Ni-coated W powders are mixed with Cu powders, and then the mixed powders are sintered to prepare 67W-25Cu-8Ni alloy by using spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. 67W-25Cu-8Ni alloy is analyzed by scanning electric microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results show that, when W powder particle size is in range from 4 μm to 6 μm, the complexing agent of sodium pyrophosphate is 60 g/L, triethanolamine is 100 g/L, and trisodium citrate is 8 g/L. The Ni layer is uniform and complete, and the weight percent of Ni in W-Ni powder can be controlled by adjusting the W powder loading. Metallurgical bonding is achieved at the W/Ni/Cu interface. Compared with W-Cu alloy, the sintering density of 67W-25Cu-8Ni alloy prepared by SPS is greatly increased, reaching to 97%.

12344279183	Fracture and damage behaviour of tungsten alloy of 93W and 98W under explosive loading	The fragment mass, amount distribution and penetrating behaviour of 93 W and 98 W under explosive loading were investigated. The mass of 93 W fragments ranged from 0.1 g to 3.0 g. The mass and shape of 93W fragments are not well-distributed, but those of 98 W are. The mass of 98 W fragments has a concentrated distribution from 0.1 g to 0.5 g and over 98% of the fragment shapes are close to isoaxial. Failures at the tungsten-matrix interface are main on fragments of 93 W. However, 98 W fragments had a large proportion of transgranular cleavage.
