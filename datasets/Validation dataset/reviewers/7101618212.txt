84928193281	Performance study on viscoelastic and drag reduction of a hydrophobically associating polymer	In the paper, the viscoelasticity of hydrophobic associating polymer BCG-1 solution was investigated, the frictional resistance of the BCG-1 solutions with different concentration was examined using homemade flow loop testing system and the filed test was conducted. Experimental results showed that the first normal stress difference N 1 of the BCG-1 aqueous solutions with different concentrations increased with shear stress increasing, moreover, Under high shear stress, a more elastic effects was shown, the higher concentration, the greater the values of the first normal stress difference N 1 at the same shear stress. When the concentration of the BCG-1 aqueous solutions was less than the critical associating concentrations, G′ was less than G″, the association was weaker between the molecular chains, and an effective spatial structure did not form, after the concentration of BCG-1 was above of critical associating concentrations, G′ was greater than G″, the association between molecular chains increased. As the concentration increased, the curve of G′ and G″ of BCG-1 solution was gradually closer to parallel, the viscoelastic contribution percentage of the hydrophobic association decreased, while the viscoelastic contribution percentage of molecular interaction between main chain entanglements increased. The drag reduction rate first increased and then decreased as the concentration increased, under strong shear force, the disentanglement between the hydrophobic associating polymer main chain required longer time, and the aqueous liquidity weakened, resistance-reducing capacity reduced. It is not the only way to increase the relative molecular weight to improve resistance-reducing capability of polymer. Hydrophobic associating polymer thick water solution system also had good resistance reduction capability. The field construction showed that the maximum Drag reduction rate was of over 70%.

8644221436	Effects of hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymer on the foaming performance	The effects of hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymer (NAPs-14) on the surface tension, foam height, solution viscosity, and foam half-life of the surfactant foam solution were studied, and the results were compared with that of PVP360 of weaker effect on surfactant and HPAM of no effect on surfactant. Its effects on the foam stability of surfactant were also studied. The hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymer (NAPs-14) had certain surface non-activity. It produced the association reaction with surfactant by hydro-probating, thus improved the viscosity and strength of foaming fluid film, lowered down the discharging rate, and eventually produced better foam stability. In comparison, HPAM also had good foam stability. However, it was not as good as NAPs-14, while PVP360 had little foam stability.

16544373408	Study on deformation and load distribution law of marine riser for off-shore deep drilling	With static analysis and dynamics analysis of marine risers, the article develops the 3-D finite element mechanical model under the marine environment loads produced by sea flow and waves during offshore deep drilling. Considering the characteristics of big deformation with small strain under the outside loads and axial force influence, for marine risers, and using non-linear theory, the calculated results match the real situations, better. The calculation and analysis is conducted for the deformation and load distribution law of marine risers for offshore deep drilling considering the 3-D load stood by the marine riser. It is found that the under-water middle section of the riser has the biggest deformation, and the riser section near the water surface has the biggest bending load. And real riser failing accidents have also proved the results. The article reveals the dynamic mechanism of riser failing for offshore, deep drilling. The strength of the riser at the section with big bending load should paid special attention. The article also analyzes the influence of major marine environment loads, such as sea wave flowing velocity, wave cycle, and wave height etc., on the deformation and the strength of risers.

19544387919	Influence of ground stress field on borehole trajectory design and wellface stability	Wellface tension failure and shear collapse have seriously influenced the drilling speed, quality and cost, and, in partial new exploration areas, the objective formations couldn't be drilled because of the wellface's unstability, thus delaying exploration and development and affecting overall economic efficiency. The influences of ground stress field on the borehole trajectory design and wellface stability of the vertical well and horizontal well were calculated and analyzed by use of the linear elastic mechanical model. The results indicated that, while the vertical stress was the maximum in-situ principal stress, it was most difficult to form shear collapse in the vertical well, then in the horizontal well distributed along the minimum in-situ horizontal principal stress direction; when the vertical stress was the in-situ intermediate principal stress, the wellface of the vertical well was most instable and it was easiest to form shear collapse in the well; and, while the vertical stress was the minimum in-situ principal stress, it was most difficult to form shear collapse in the borehole parallel to the maximum in-situ horizontal principal stress direction and easiest in that parallel to the minimum one. On the same drilling conditions, it is easier to form tension lost circulation in the borehole parallel to the intermediate in-situ principal stress direction than in the borehole parallel to the maximum or minimum in-situ principal stress direction, so that the borehole should avoid the intermediate principal stress direction as far as possible in order to prevent and reduce downhole accidents, and the in-situ stress magnitude and direction's being accurately determined is of great importance to optimizing drilling and reducing drilling cost.

19344365302	Dynamics analysis of marine riser for offshore deep drilling	As offshore drilling activities expand to more deeper water areas, the force acting to the marine riser becomes more and more complicated. As the water depth increases, the dynamics analysis of the marine riser becomes more and more important. Considering the 3-D loads borne by the marine riser, and using finite element method, the article analyzes the dynamics characteristics of the deep marine riser with the 3-D dynamics model. The study shows the influence of the top tension on the self-vibration frequency of the marine riser is obvious. The self-vibration frequency of the marine riser increases as the top tension increases. The higher order frequency of deep marine riser under the convenient situation is close to the common frequency of sea waves, for which more attention should be paid while designing and working. Adjusting the top tension of the marine riser can change the self-vibration frequency of the marine riser system in a certain range to prevent the frequency that may cause the common vibration with sea waves.

22144496833	Discussion to exploit coal-bed methane by gas injection with over-breaking pressure	Most of coal-bed gas reservoirs characterize low pressure, low permeability, low gas saturation etc. in China. It is not successful to use the techniques of conventional stimulations and pressure-decreasing recovery. The article proposes the idea to exploit the coal-bed gas reservoirs with low permeability by gas injection with over-breaking pressure, which combines the primary recovery with the stimulation and the improvement of recovery factor closely and performs the measures to improve the recovery factor even in the initial production stage. Study shows the process of desorption-diffusion- percolation of coal-bed methane is affected by several factors. It is necessary for coal-bed gas exploitation to improve the permeability of the reservoir in one hand and promote efficient and fast desorption of the methane in the other hand. The mechanism to exploit coal-bed methane by gas injection with over-breaking pressure mainly includes decreasing the partial pressure of methane to induce methane desorption, displacing the desorbed methane by competitive sorption, forming micro-fissures and extending natural fractures, increasing energy for gas flow, preventing fracture closure and water-phase trap, and reducing stress-sensitivity damage. The mode of gas injection with over-breaking pressure includes the huff and puff of gas injection and the gas drive. The mode of huff and puff is suitable for single-well reservoir. The mode of gas drive can only be used with injection/production well pattern. It is suggested according to the characteristics of coal-bed gas exploited by gas injection, the proper modes of gas injection and well completion should be selected, and the matching techniques of coal-bed gas exploited by gas injection should be developed to improve the production and recovery factor of coal-bed methane.

0030383203	Why low permeability and how does it affect coalbed methane supply in coal seams in China	This paper analyses the main effects of permeability of coal seams on the coalbed methane exploration in the light of mechanisms of methane adsorption and desorption and the micropore structures. It points out that the obstacle to a successful exploitation of coalbed methane is the low permeability of the coal seams. Further, the stress constraint of the seal structure with gas saturated fractures is the primary cause of the low permeability of the coal seams in China. The critical depth that is affected by this cause, based on the existing coalbed exploration technology, is calculated in this paper.

0032306799	Stress sensitivity of naturally fractured-porous reservoir with dual-porosity	Compared with porous sandstone reservoirs, the complicated fractured(fractured-porous) reservoir is of high stress sensibility. This results in not only the difficulties of calculating transport properties of actual formations, but also problems on formation protection. The stress sensibility of the reservoir results mainly from that of fractures in the reservoir. Therefore, the topologic properties of both natural and many tan-made fractures without any grinding, taking from both actual reservoirs and crops on the ground, are investigated and analyzed with elastic and elastic/plastic micro-contacting theory. Then the stress sensibility of fractures is numerically modeled on computer and tested in lab. Some conclusions different from that of publications are obtained. Consequently, a method of analyzing and evaluating stress sensibility of dual-porosity reservoir with natural fractures is made on the basis of the investigation. This can thus be applied to the calculation of in-situ transport property for naturally fractured reservoir and provide basic data for the formation protection of porous fractured reservoirs.

0032315610	Some problems in the exploration and exploitation low permeability of oil and gas resources in China	In China, at least 50% of the total oil and gas resources exist in the low permeability reservoirs. Whether the low permeability oil and gas resources can be produced and utilized commercially is one of the important problems for China's energy supplying in the 21st century. The most important problem in the exploration and exploitation of low permeability oil gas resources is the serious formation damage in pay zones. This formation damage exists from the beginning to the end in drilling, well completion, stimulation, oil and gas production. Another important problem is the economical benefit. The production and utilization of low permeability oil and gas resources was limited by the high input and the low output. Based on systematical analysis of reservoir characters, damage mechanism and flowing patterns of low permeability reservoirs, a suit of techniques was worked out to deal with low permeability reservoirs in this paper, including exploration, reservoir description, drilling, well pattern, stimulation and production.

23844481820	Evaluation on rock drill-ability by well logging data	Rock drill-ability is the basic parameter to optimize bits, make drilling plan and reduce drilling cost. So, it is very important to predict the rock drill-ability reliably, quickly and low costly. Based on the existing prediction methods of rock drill-ability, the relationship between the rock drill-ability and the logging parameters is discussed. The method to predict the rock drill-ability by logging data integrating with mud logging data is studied. The result shows the method to use logging data and their derived data integrating with mud logging data to calculate the rock drill-ability and select bits can overcome the defects of in-house micro drill bit experiments, in which the limited cores are used and the performance of the entire rock body can't be reflected. The method can realize the formation drill-ability prediction quickly in the field at real time. The study also shows the existing method to predict the formation drill-ability only by the sonic time-difference curves can't determine the formation drill-ability surely. Therefore, various kinds of data have to be used usually including the rock physical parameters that reflect the formation lithology besides the sonic logging data. Taking the field L as example, the effect of the rock physical parameters on the formation drill-ability is studied.

27644585593	Application and research of a novel polymer in high density drilling fluid	One of the main technical problems of water-based drilling fluid for deep wells is the rheological characteristic. In high-temperature wells, drilling fluid viscosity is difficult to control, and sometimes gelatification may occur. So hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymer was developed to improve the fluid's suspension stability at high temperature, which could take the place of conventional high molecule polymers in low-solid drilling fluid. Laboratory tests evaluated the influence of hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymer addition on drilling fluid properties, especially the influence on rheological property of fluids with different bentonite concentration. When hydrophobically associating water-soluble polymer was added into a low-solid drilling fluid, the fluid provided good suspension and stability at high temperature. For example, when it was used in a high-density water-based drilling fluid in which the bentonite concentration is 3%, and the viscosity is low, the suspension was still excellent.

3242883357	Viscosity behavior of cationic gemini surfactants with long alkyl chains	Viscosity experiments were carried out on aqueous micellar solutions of the cationic gemini surfactants as a function of surfactant concentration, aging time, temperature and shear rate. The viscosity behavior of cationic gemini surfactants in dilute solution is closely related to the alkyl chains and spacer groups of gemini surfactants. The viscosities of some gemini surfactants solutions vary with aging time, such as 16-4-16 and 18-4-18. For 12-2-12, the viscosity of solution decreases with the increase of temperature. But for series of 16-s-16 and 18-s-18 with s=2 or 3, the viscosity variations of them are particularly unusual with the increasing of temperature, which increase at first, then reach a peak and decrease in the end. The effect of shear rate on the micellar solution of 22-4-22 was investigated and shear-induced thickening was not observed at the experimental shear rate ranges. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

33646524769	Viscoelasticity and rheological behaviors of hydrophobic association polymer solution	The dynamic viscoelasticity and normal rheological behavior of hydrophobic association polymer solution (HAPS) as well as the rheological behavior of HAPS in porous media were measured. The experimental results of dynamic viscoelasticity of HAPS indicate that the loss modulus (G″) and elastic modulus (G′) of association polymer solution are higher when the concentration of association polymer (AP) is higher than the critical association concentration. The G″ is larger than the G′ when concentration of AP is lower than the critical association concentration, and the G″ is smaller than the G′ when the concentration of AP is higher than the critical association concentration. The G″ and G′ are free from shear stress in the different concentration of HAPS. Under the experimental shear rate, the macroscopical rheological behaviors of HAPS show shear thinning and shear thickening. In porous media, the rheological behavior of HAPS shows the properties of Newton fluid under the low-speed shear. The shear thinning and shear thickening behaviors could be observed when increasing shear rate. The polymer with a bigger elasticity should be used, and its injecting rate should be higher than the critical viscoelastic flow rate when using hydrophobic association polymer in polymer flooding, fn this way, the viscoelasticity of hydrophobic association polymer can be fully utilized to enhance oil recovery.

The experimental results show that HAPAM can easily self- assemble to form a stock aggregate by hydrophobic driving force in aqueous dilute solution. The critical associating concentration (CAC) of HAPAM is very low. The dynamic variation of the apparent particle diameter of HAPAM and PAM are observed by dynamic light scattering. At the CAC of HAPAM, the particle of HAPAM from small size grows into large size, but PAM does not show this phenomenon at the same polymer concentration. This shows that self-assembly in aqueous solution is the unique behavior of HAPAM.

The hydrophobically associating polymer had apparent associating characteristics and thickening effect, and was better than HPAM in terms of temperature stability and salinity tolerance. Inorganic salts, especially the divalent salts, and their concentrations had great influence on the properties of the polymer solution. Thus, in synthesizing hydrophobically associating polymer, different molecular structure of the polymer should be designed for different formation water salinity for which the synthesized polymer will be used.

3442877814	The viscosity behavior of gemini surfactants	The viscosity behaviors of cationic gemini surfactants were investigated and the behaviors were found to be closely related to spacer groups and alkyl chains of the gemini surfactants. For gemini surfactants with shorter spacer group, i. e. s = 2, 3 or 4, their solutions exhibit striking viscosity behaviors. However, there is a time effect on viscosity for solutions of some gemini surfactants with s = 4. But for gemini surfactants with spacer group s = 6, the solutions have almost the same viscosity as that of solvent even at high concentration. The viscosity increases with the increasing of alkyl carbon number at the same surfactant concentration. For some surfactants with spacer group s = 2 or 3, the viscosities of solutions undergo a maximum as a function of temperature. The mixtures of gemini surfactants and sodium salicylate (NaSal) also exhibit a great viscosification.

The results show: the influence of concentration and salinity on the viscoelasticity of APS is the same as on HPAM solution. The viscoelasticity of HPAM solution is resulted from tangle between molecular chains, while the viscoelasticity of APS is mainly caused by the associating action between molecular chains, therefore APS shows obvious elasticity in lower concentration. In low and wide frequency scope, the elasticity of APS is larger than the one of HPAM solution obviously, which explains that APS will show obvious elasticity in lower shear velocity when APS flows in porous media, which signifies that the purpose may be achieved by using polymer solution's elasticity to enhance displacement efficiency in not very high injecting rate.

Spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation measurements of the protons showed that the motion of the spacer protons and a part of the methylene protons next to the polar head group was seriously restricted. Therefore, these protons should be involved in the formation of the surface layer of the hydrophobic micellar core. The hydrophobic protons that were away from the polar head group were situated internally in the micellar core and moved relatively freely. Relaxation measurements of the 14-s-14 series (s=2, 3, 4) also showed that the molecules were more tightly packed as the length of the spacer decreased. Their motion was relatively more restricted than those of TTAB, the monomeric homologue of 14-4-14. 2D NOESY spectrum of 14-4-14 exhibited the same pattern as that of 16-4-16. This showed that the micelles of 14-4-14 were spherical, and the surface exhibited a saw-toothed form, similar to that of 16-4-16. Consequently, the length of the alkyl chain did not have any effect on the relative arrangement of molecules in the micelles. © 2007 Chinese Chemical Society and College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University.

The morphology of a gemini surfactant in aqueous solution is strongly influenced by the temperature: vesicles or sphere-like aggregates are formed in the dilute solution of 18-3-18 under 25 °C environment; when the solution temperature goes up to 50 °C, such aggregates will transit to worm-like micelles with the length of each from 100 nm to 400 nm; meanwhile, the increase of concentration may lead to the formation of network; however, the worm-like micelles or network will transit to vesicles or sphere-like aggregates again when the temperature reaches 80 °C. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

And the gel has visible viscoelasticity that the gel have high displacement efficiency to cut off the connection between the formation fluid and the drilling fluid in borehole. And the gel is hard to be diluted by formation fluids for its apparent viscosity and strong cohesive force. Therefore, the gel is potential to control severe lost circulation accompanying with water zones or overflow and loss coexist.

The viscosities of HPAM and HAWP solutions were both decreased around perforation of wellbore simulation device. Interestingly, viscosity of HAWP recovered from stratum 0.2 m. Until stratum 1.6 m, its viscosity recovered almost 50% of original. The data of intrinsic viscosity showed that the molecular chains of HAWP and HPAM were both degraded without any recovery. The contradiction was further studied by particle size and its microstructure. The mean particle size and particle size distribution data both showed HAWP recovered but HPAM was not. The microstructures of HAWP by atomic force microscopy images further explain the recovery of viscosity. The disassembled molecular chain was self-assembled into aggregate to newly network by hydrophobes with weaker linking than original solution. While the microstructure of HPAM was thoroughly split up to randomly coil without linking. In addition, the viscoelasticity of HAWP was also recovered to some extent but HPAM was not. All the results proved that HAWP has mobility control ability to displace oil in reservoir even if suffered severely shearing by wellbore. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84877302075	Thermal uniformity analysis of polar and non-polar solvents during heating based on numerical calculation	It is a key issue to obtain uniform heating in certain regions of an applicator. In this paper, the non-polar (CCl4) and polar (water) solvents are heated together in same container. The silicon-carbide is chose to be a vessel. The uniformities of temperature were analyzed using finite-element method under different configurations during heating. The results show that the temperature uniformity is influenced by solvent volume size and volume ratio and the thermal energy transfers from the non-polar to polar solvent for temperature difference. When the improvement in temperature uniformity is not obvious, it can improve significantly the uniformity of temperature by changing the volume or volume ratio.

84888011495	Hydrolytic Degradation of PPDO/PDLLA Blends Containing the Compatibilizer PLADO	The poly(para-dioxanone) (PPDO)/poly poly (dl-lactide) (PDLLA) blends containing various contents of compatibilizer (0, 1, 3, 5, 10 %) were prepared by solution co-precipitation, which were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) to form 10 % wt/vol solutions. Then in vitro hydrolytic degradation of PPDO/PDLLA blends containing poly (dl-lactide-co-para-dioxanone) (PLADO) as the compatibilizer was studied by the changes of weight loss, water absorption, thermal properties, surface morphology and mechanical properties of samples in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.44) at 37 °C for 8 weeks. During the degradation, the weight loss and water absorption increased significantly for all blends, whereas hydrolysis rate of blends varied with the blend composition. The samples' glass transition temperature decreased notably, while the degrees of crystallinity increased. Compared with uncompatibilized PPDO/PDLLA blends, PPDO/PDLLA blends with compatibilizer exhibited higher hydrolysis rate. The results suggested that the compatibilizer (PLADO) accelerated the hydrolysis rate of PPDO/PDLLA blends during the degradation. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

43949122173	The effect of temperature on the interfacial tension between crude oil and gemini surfactant solution	The effect of temperature on the interfacial tension between gemini surfactant solution and crude oil is investigated in this paper. The interfacial tension is measured by the spinning drop interfacial tension-meter of Texas-500c. For surfactants 14-4-14 and 16-4-16, the interfacial tensions are very sensitive to temperature and undergo minima with the increase of the temperature. Temperature has also an effect on the dynamic interfacial tension, i.e. increasing the temperature can shorten the time needed for an interfacial tension to reach equilibrium. However, for a mixing surfactant system, the effect of temperature on the interfacial tension between oil and surfactant solution is not remarkable because of synergism. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

45449086894	Research on mechanism of increasing flexibility and decreasing brittleness of cement sheath in oil well	The cracking reason of cement sheath in oil well was analyzed. The crack of chemical bond and the propagation of inner fractures in cement stone resulted in the annual flow in the later stage of stimulation and development of oil-gas wells. The experiment of active mechanism of additives and material adding into cement stone for controlling brittleness of cement stone in oil-gas wells was carried out. The matrix-plasticization design mode for crystalline phase, gel phase, intergranular packing and intergranular bridging was established. This model was used to develop the multi-compound material for decreasing the brittleness and increasing the flexibility of cement sheath. The multi-compound material cement stone was adaptable to down-hole conditions. The integrity of cement sheath can meet the demands of oil and gas development and prolong the production lifetime of oil and gas wells.

4644340487	Closure behaviour of natural rock fractures	In order to investigate the closure behaviour of natural rock fractures, a surface measurement system called as photoelectric surfometer was developed. It can survey and calculate automatically topographies of rock surfaces, being especially effective on natural rock surfaces which have larger heaves compared with polished rock surfaces widely used in previous publications. Computer simulation is then applied to mimic the closure behaviour of natural rock fractures by utilising both elastic and plastoelastic contact theory between rough surfaces. Experimental results confirmed computer simulation. Simulation and experiments show that plastic flow can be ignored for natural fractures within most concerned reservoir formation rock (carbonate rock and tight sandstone). An empirical model based on simulating results is then proposed, which includes rock properties, initial aperture and surface topographies. This model, being different from any other models proposed in previous publications, can be used to explain the different phenomena found both at laboratory experiments and in situ reservoir formations.

Room-temperature dry friction experiment was carried out on MM-200 wear test machine, wear resistance of the nano multi-phase coatings was compared with that of the traditional ceramic coating, and worn surface of the coatings was observed using SEM. The results shows that the wear resistance of nano multi-phase coating is superior than that of the conventional one, however, as the increase of wear loading their wear mechanisms are different, the wear mechanism of conventional coating is micro crack and flaking of particles, and the mechanism of nano multi-phase coating is adhesion wear, part peel off in the same conditions for the increase of its impact strength.

57849158622	Characterization and solution properties of a novel water-soluble terpolymer for enhanced oil recovery	To obtain the polymer with good ageing property and the application in medium- and low-permeability oil layers, the water-soluble hydrophobically acrylamide-modified terpolymer (PAAN) with sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulphonate (NaAMPS) and 2-vinylnaphthalene as a hydrophobic monomer (VN) was synthesized by the micellar copolymerization. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) results show that large aromatic groups are incorporated into the PAAN polymer in the form of microblock structure and can increase the rigidity of molecular chains, resulting in the good thermal property of the polymer. The measurement results for intrinsic viscosities of PAAN indicate that the molecular weights of polymers are low and the breakage of the polymer chains can not occur at high shear rate. The polymer exhibits salt-thickening, temperature-thickening, thixotropy and good anti-ageing property. The hydrophobic microdomains and associating three-dimensional networks in the aqueous solution of PAAN were observed respectively by flourescent probe and ESEM. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

The polymer is expected to possess a low molecular weight and high solution viscosity. The steady-state consecutive shear cycles of PAAP in aqueous and brine solutions were measured, and the viscoelastic properties of PAAP solutions were investigated as a function of polymer, NaCl and sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) concentrations. The aqueous PAAP solutions exhibits pseudoplastic and thixotropic behavior over the range of shear rate and shear thickening behavior at very low shear rate. The steady-state shear results show that some disrupted associating aggregates at high shear rate can be reformed during the shear reversion process and the suitable shear rate is favorable to the formation of hydrophobically associative structures in the brine solutions.

The solution apparent viscosity and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements showed that the intermolecular hydrophobic associations were reinforced via electrostatic attraction of opposite charges and the network structures with huge hydrodynamic volume were formed. When the mass fractions of PBAD in PASA/PBAD were 15% and 90%, respectively, the apparent viscosities of the 2 g/l aqueous and NaCl solutions (The concentration of NaCl was 1.026 mol/l) of PASA/PBAD were 3561 mPa·s and 227 mPa·s, respectively, which were greatly higher than that of the aqueous and brine solution of mono-component polymer PBAD and PASA with the same mass concentration. With increasing the NaCl concentration to 1.710 mol/l, the brine solution viscosity of PASA/PBAD was still up to 201 mPa·s, indicating its good salt resistance. The anti-shearing and anti-heating properties of PASA/PBAD composite solution were also obviously improved.

62149107107	Researches on mud losses prevention and control	The use of drilling fluid with Lost Circulation Materials (LCM) as part of it during drilling plays an important role in drilling the formations with narrower safe density windows and abundant fractures. The LCM in the mud flows with the fluid into fractures when the fractures are initially narrower, thus in a short time, the fractures can be filled with LCM and the formations with the fractures may have, to some extent, higher pressure containment because of the existence of the LCM in the fractures. Using a modified device evaluating the performance of LCM (model DL with fractures between 1-3 mm), the composition and sizes of LCM muds were tested for use in Well DN2-24 having multiple mud losses zones and higher rate of losses, and uncertainty of the position of loss zones. The test of the LCM mud was successful. The concentrations of LCM used were less compared with adjacent wells, and the sizes of LCM were smaller. The LCM used had little, if any, effects on the performance of the mud.

Based on laboratory studies on the changes in mechanical property and in strength of formation rocks before and after contact with drilling fluids, and the effects these changes will have on formation collapse pressures, the formulations of drilling fluids used in Block Yangtake were modified by adding 5-7% KCl and 1-3% EP-1/EP-2 to the previously used conventional polymer/polymeric sulfonated drilling fluids. The modified formulation, which was tried on well YT1-7, had an obvious effect on reducing the increasing amplitude of formation collapse pressures. Compared with offset wells, the mud density used in well YT1-7 was greatly reduced, and borehole stability was achieved with the low-density mud. Rate of penetration was increased.

67449147117	The interfacial tension between cationic gemini surfactant solution and crude oil	The effects of the hydrocarbon chains and spacer groups of gemini surfactants, salt, temperature, and polymer on the interfacial tension of crude oil-water mixtures were investigated in this paper. The length of the alkyl chain is a major factor affecting the properties of a gemini surfactant, and the spacer group is also an important factor influencing the surfactant properties. The addition of salt results in a great decrease in the CMC and favors the reduction of interfacial tension, which shows that a gemini surfactant has a good synergism with salt. Variation in temperature will affect the dynamic and equilibrium interfacial tension, and increasing the temperature can shorten the time to reach the equilibrium and decrease the equilibrium interfacial tension in the range of experimental temperatures. With the addition of polyacrylamide (PAM), it takes longer to reach equilibrium, but this has little effect on the value of equilibrium interfacial tension. © 2009 AOCS.

The bearing resistance of an artificial core with fractures was tested on a modified DL LCM tester with drilling fluids containing different concentrations of rigid plugging agent and nut shell. It was concluded that the use of rigid plugging agent improved the bearing resistance of formations because of its high strengths and resistance to hydration, as well as its ability to bridging, packing and sealing. By using the rigid plugging agent and nut shell in well DN2-4 and Moshen-1, it was shown that the compound LCMs can improve the bearing resistance of the formation to which mud loss occurred. Mud loss was completely stopped after the dental work using the compound LCM mud.

71049139931	Research on effect of drilling fluid on Kuqa shale strength behavior and its applications	The effect of different drilling fluids on the strength behavior of Kuqa shale is studied based on triaxial rock mechanical test. Combined with existing drilling fluid performance evaluation methods, stress-strain curve shown by shale after immersion in different drilling fluids for 24 hours and the rock mechanical performance, rock deformation and failure laws, the existing drilling fluid is selected and optimized. One drilling fluid with better stabilization to this kind of shale formation is obtained. Besides, the formation collapse pressure change in different drilling fluids is also calculated and analyzed by testing rock strength before and after immersion in those systems. The findings achieve remarkable wellbore stabilization and speedup effect when they are applied to drilling field practice. Results show that present drilling fluid will remarkably decrease rock strength, and the shale strength performance can be regulated and changed by optimizing the drilling fluid. Rock strength performance research is applied to existing shale drilling fluid evaluation. It can not only induce the chemo-mechanical coupling between shale and drilling fluid initiatively into the optimization procedure of drilling fluid system, but also can establish theoretical and methodological basis to restrain the uncertain effect to shale wellbore caused by coupling chemo-mechanical radically. The research combines the optimization procedure of drilling fluid with wellbore stability. It establishes the basis to obtain collapse pressure of target shale formation and achieve safe, effective drilling with low density drilling fluid. Deformation failure law showed by shale after contacted with different drilling fluid is the important criteria to shale formation drilling fluid stabilization and wellbore performance optimization. The stress-strain curve of shale before and after being immersed by different drilling fluids can lead to achieve evaluation and optimization of drilling fluid performance. The shale strength behavior and collapse pressure are adjustable by optimizing drilling mud components.

CLT is a kind of novel vegetable phenol-sulfate that has been continuously modified through the reactions of oxidation, condensation and cross-linking. Experimental results showed that effects of FCLS and CLT upon the polymer drilling fluids were different, FCLS aggravated the hydration-disperse of land-waste and damaged the inhibitor properties of polymer drilling fluids. But CLT heightened the polymer's adsorptive-warping ability on the outside surface of land-waste, and then enhanced the inhibitor properties of polymer drilling fluids.

75449097882	Aggregation behavior of a water-soluble terpolymer with vinyl biphenyl characterized by a fluorescent probe	A terpolymer (PAAP) of acrylamide, sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonate, and vinyl biphenyl as a hydrophobic monomer was synthesized to obtain a polymeric oil-flooding agent with low molecular weight and application in oil reservoirs with medium to low permeability. The intermolecular self-assembling mechanisms in the PAAP solutions were investigated with a pyrene fluorescence probe as functions of the polymer concentration, surfactant, and temperature. The hydrophobically associating morphologies of PAAP in an unsalted solution were observed with scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the high solution viscosity of PAAP was due to the strong intermolecular hydrophobic associations of the biphenyl groups, and the critical association concentration was 0.05 g/dL for the unsalted and brine PAAP solutions. The nonpolarity and association degree in the hydrophobic microdomains were greatly influenced by the polymer concentration. With the addition of the optimum sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate concentration, the interpolymer hydrophobic associations were strengthened remarkably via the connection of the surfactant with biphenyl groups from different polymer chains. The number and sizes of the aggregates increased in the range of 20-50°C. These results demonstrate that the thickening effect of the PAAP polymer in the aqueous solution was due to intermolecular associations of the biphenyl groups. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The results of yield stress tested by stable tests and dynamic tests were analyzed and compared with the data obtained by conventional drilling fluid yield stress evaluation method. The yield stress of the gel could be exactly obtained by the inflexion of strain-stress log-log plot curve under stress control test and the crossover of the linear viscoelastic range and nonlinear viscoelastic range of stress scan test at a fixed frequency.

Over 20 different drilling fluids were examined for their effects on shale strength, Emphasis here was on the mechanical properties of shale samples after exposed to different drilling fluids for 24 hours. All shale samples selected from similar depth and all tri-axial rock mechanic tests were performed under the conditions of 45MPa confining pressure. The mud which maintains high compressive strength of the shale is the optimum selection. The all shale samples exposed to using polymer drilling fluid exhibit the lowest strength, from the stress-strain curve, almost lost all strength. The use of KC1 brine drilling fluids is based on its shale-inhibition characteristics as it is thought that the k+ Ion provides additional attraction among the clay platelets due to its size and charge. However, in Quka shale, the shale samples also lose most part of strength when exposed to the modified using polymer drilling muds only adding 5% KC1 and 10% KC1 respectively. The one of main possible reasons is Kaolinite in the shale. The shale samples will keep more original strength when exposed to the modified using polymer drilling muds with chemical agents with plugging ability to pore throat and micro-fracture. The all shale samples exposed to using polymer drilling fluid with 10%KC1 and 3%A and B% exhibit the highest strength, then it was used be a new system in drilling 2 new wells. The results show that the drilling fluid density has been decreased largely, and the wellbore stability has been improved remarkably while shale formation is stable.

Based on theory of structure liquid, supramolecular chemistry, water-solubility salt-resisting and temperature-resisting polymer, we designed and synthesized the gel, called special gel, which is used to control severe lost circulation. When dispersed in water, a reversible supramolecular structure (dynamic physical cross-linking network) developed, which rendered the dispersion some special characteristics. This paper investigates the rheology of the gel which is accordance with pseudoplastic fluid with yield point. The gel has thixotropy, good tackifying effect and shear-thinning behavior, and visible viscoelasticity. Those rheology characteristics show the gel has the potential to plug the weak zone. The gel is hard to be dilute by formation fluids for its apparent viscosity and strong cohesive force. Its shear-thinning property can provide the gel be pumped and flow in pipes easily, and flow with high viscosity and resistance in the zone porous. And its visoelasticity make the gel has high flood efficiency to cut off the connection between the formation fluid and the drilling fluid in borehole. It will impose a higher pressure to push the gel system after the gel stay. And the gel has good Compatibility with common use lost circulation materials such as walnut shell, cement. When the loss pressure difference is too high, the gel can be used with bridge plug or cement. The gel is benefit to control severe lost circulation accompanying with water zones or overflow and loss coexist.

In recent years, they are attracting much increasing attention because of their unusual rheological and amphipathic properties in the presence of added salt, and potential industrial applications. One of the applications directly relates to clay, for instance, the adsorption of hydrophobic associative polyacrylamide on clay has been studied. However, the interaction of hydrophobically-modified water-soluble amphoteric polymer with clay has been so far hardly investigated including the adsorption. In the previous paper, the hydrophobically-modified water-soluble amphoteric cellulosic graft copolymer (carboxymethylcellulose grafting acrylamide and dimethyloctyl(2-methacryloxyethyl) ammonium bromide, abbr.

In this paper, the adsorption amount (Γ) of CGAO on clay has been investigated as a function of concentration of CGAO and NaCl, temperature, pH, surfactant and clay content by means of the ultraviolet spectrum. The results indicate that Γ tends to increase with the increasing of CGAO concentration, but no saturation of adsorption is observed as in the case of the general polymer; Γ sharply rises up with the increment of NaCl concentration up to 1 mol·L

79958718285	Plugging mechanism and estimation models of rigid particles while drilling in fracture formations	The size and concentration of the loss control materials(LCMs) used in the leak resistance while drilling for fracture-developed formations, are determined mainly by operators' experience and may not match with the fracture of formations. In order to solve this problem, the present paper suggested to use a special LCM called rigid particles that were mainly composed of calcium carbonate and accorded with the demand of leak resistance. Meanwhile, the paper proposed a plugging mechanism of rigid particles for fractures. This mechanism proposed that rigid particles could form a plugging layer at the terminal of fractures to eliminate the pressure of drilling fluids on walls of fractures by obstructing the drilling fluid within fractures, which plugged fractures stably and increased the pressure-bearing capacity of formations. Various models of the size selection and concentration estimation for multi-grade rigid particles were established based on this mechanism and adopted to example computation. The study results were useful in guiding field operation, enriched and improved leak-resistance and plugging-while-drilling techniques of rigid particles for fracture-developed formations.

The results indicated that above the critical associating concentration (CAC), resistance factors of the associating polymer solution firstly dropped and then rose with the increase of pore velocity, but they started dropping again when they reached to a certain degree. However, below CAC, both resistance factors and residual resistance factors of the associating polymer solution rose firstly and then dropped with the increase of pore velocity. Compared with HPAM, the associating polymer solution was of higher ability to improve the waterflood mobility ratio, moreover, the lower the core permeability, the stronger the ability to improve the waterflood mobility ratio, and the lower the pore velocity that displays the elasticity effect. The increase of resistance factors for the associating polymer solution was mainly resulted from a higher adsorption and retention quantity of solution at low velocity, but from a better elasticity of solution at high velocity.

It is found that the anionic and cationic acrylamide polymers containing cyclodextrin moieties show better performances on interfacial tension, salt resistance, temperature tolerance, viscosification property and shear resistance than that of polyacrylamide. By the comprehensive comparison and analysis, the anionic polymer is more conductive to decrease the interfacial tension for the tertiary oil recovery process, while the cationic polymer is more suitable for enhancing oil recovery in high-temperature and high-mineralization oilfield. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84862062769	Displacement characters of combination flooding systems consisting of gemini-nonionic mixed surfactant and hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide for bohai offshoreoilfield	In this paper, the injectivity and displacement characters of a new polymer-surfactant (SP) flooding system consisting of gemini-nonionic mixed surfactant and hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide (HAPAM) have been studied under Bohai offshore oilfield reservoir conditions. The injectivity tests have shown that the SP system could build higher resistance factor (RF) and residual resistance factor (RRF) to expand sweep efficiency in nonheterogeneous reservoirs. A total of 10 core flooding tests were carried out to investigate the effect of heterogeneity, slug composition, and polymer molecular structure. The results have shown that the system could obtain higher recovery owing to higher viscosity and ultralow interfacial tension (IFT) compare to water flooding and polymer flooding. The slug composition, with 0.175% polymer and 0.3% mixed surfactant, which forms a composite with the ratio of 4:1 gemini surfactant to nonionic surfactant, could allow full play to viscosity and IFT economically. Moreover, we found that the SP system with HAPAM could obtain a higher oil recovery by 6-13% original oil in place (OOIP) than a nonmodified one, as a result of viscoelastic rheology. The laboratory core tests provided credible proofs for large scale application with this SP system in Bohai offshore oilfield. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84863035689	Technology of controlling loss by drilling-in slugging for fracture formation	To solve the problem of the preventing agent's size can't too big and the concentration can't too high for the screen shaker's limit and the drilling fluids' demands on the process of preventing and controlling loss while drilling for fracture, the drilling-in slugging process technology was proposed. The drilling-in slugging process technology is that the bigger size and higher concentration preventing loss agents was matched on a separate tank, and a selection of drilling-in slugging was pumped into well to prevent and seal mud loss when the formation has a tendency of loss or a loss had been found. The drilling-in slugging loss control agents can seal some big fracture and make up the preventing loss process technology's disadvantage of entering preventing loss agents into all the circulations for using the bigger size and higher concentration agents. The practice cases have resulted in a good effect on preventing and sealing the fracture loss by using this technology. The success of the drilling-in slugging process and technology has greatly developed and enriched the preventing loss technology while drilling.

The results show that the associating polymer solution has two critical association concentrations, the critical association concentration in the study on the relationship between the viscosity and concentration of polymer solution is actually the second critical association concentration; the critical association concentration of the associating polymer in the man-made fresh water (800 mg/L) is a lot lower than that in distilled water (2500 mg/L); the viscosity of its man-made fresh water solution is a lot higher than that its distilled water solution, which shows that the association polymer solution is of better salt resistance; the viscosity of the distilled water solution of MO4000 is always higher than that of the association polymer, while the viscosity of the man-made fresh water solution of the association polymer is higher than that of MO4000; in the studied range of concentration, the viscosity of the distilled water solution of MO4000 is always higher than that of its man-made fresh water solution, which shows that MO4000 is of poorer salt resistance.

0036809488	Direct visualization of microstructures in hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide aqueous solution by environmental scanning electron microscopy	Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) is an improved technique which permits the observation of samples in their native state, requiring neither sample preparation nor surface coating, and so avoids losing the original characteristics of the observed specimens. By use of a differential pumping aperture system and a secondary electron detector, the environmental conditions in the sample chamber can be varied and accommodated to the properties of the samples. This newly developed technique is used in this work to characterize the microstructures of hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide (HMPAM) and its unmodified precursor in aqueous solution. The microstructures were directly visualized by sublimation of the ice in freeze-dried samples. It is found that three-dimensional network structures spread throughout the whole solution for both the modified and unmodified polymers when the polymer concentration is equal to or higher than the polymer critical association concentration (CAC); when the polymer concentration is below the CAC, a sparse network structure could be seen in the solutions of modified polymer, whereas no such phenomenon is found in unmodified polymer solutions. The network units of the microstructures in the solutions of modified polymer are displayed as regularly distributed hexagons, while those of unmodified polymer appear as irregular circles. The observed results are interpreted by a proposed association model. © 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

84866385147	Calculation of dynamic gas reserves in Block SU-5 of the Sulige Gas Field	The dynamic reserves of a gas reservoir can be determined by use of the dynamic data of the reservoir and the correct calculation method appropriate for it. Therefore, it is significant to carefully screen out the dynamic reserve calculation methods for different gas reservoirs. Taking into account the characteristics of low permeability and strong heterogeneity of the Sulige Gas Field, Ordos Basin, this paper, with the dynamic data continually improved, integrates multiple methods including pressure drop analysis, elastic two-phase method, generalized material balancing, unstable production fitting and recession curve analysis to calculate the recoverable reserves of the Sulige Gas Field. The applicability of each method and the reliability of the results from the calculations are analyzed therein. According to the analysis, pressure drop analysis and unstable production fitting should be employed for the studied gas block. The calculated results of average single-well dynamic reserves are 2936 × 10

84872292034	Application of a new family of organosilicon quadripolymer as a fluid loss additive for drilling fluid at high temperature	An organosilicon quadripolymer of acrylamide (AM), 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1- propane sulfonic acid (AMPS), N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) and a kind of organosilicon monomer was synthesized by solution free radical polymerization. The chemical structure of organosilicon quadripolymer was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and molecular weight distribution was determinate by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) under the best optimum synthesis conditions, which were identified by orthogonal test according to filtrate volume of fresh water-based drilling fluid. The colloidal properties of the organosilicon quadripolymer drilling fluid were investigated in various media such as fresh-water, 4.0% salt-water, and saturated brine based fluid. The results showed that the filtrate volume decreased with the increase of the organosilicon quadripolymer concentration before and after the thermal aging test at 180°C for 16 h, and the filtrate volume after the thermal aging test was larger than that before the thermal aging test, but was smaller than the base fluid. The colloidal properties and the filtrate volume could be controlled effectively at aging temperatures not exceeding 200°C. The organosilicon quadripolymer drilling fluid performance was better than corresponding terpolymer without organosilicon group and shows favorable inhibitive property and was an excellent fluid loss additive for drilling fluid resisting high temperature in deep wells. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the improvement according to the comparative adsorption experiment. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84877582514	Structure-property relationship of polyetheramines as clay-swelling inhibitors in water-based drilling fluids	The influences of structure parameters of polyetheramines as clay-swelling inhibitors in water-based drilling fluids on the application performances were studied. Interactions of polyetheramines with clays were investigated through elemental analysis (EA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that lower molecular weight, hydrophobic oxypropylene segment, and plentiful amino group of polyetheramines favored improvement of inhibitive properties, enhancement of adsorption abilities, and expelling interlayer bound waters of clays (as confirmed by cutting rolling test, bentonite inhibition test, EA, XRD, and TGA studies). Simultaneously, the polyetheramines did not produce adverse effect to filtration control of the drilling fluids. In addition, XRD patterns revealed that these polyetheramines could intercalate into interlayer spaces of clays and display a monolayer arrangement. The corresponding basal spacing of clays was correlated only with molecular weight of polyetheramines. The dense loading of polyetheramines in the interlayer of clays was beneficial in improving inhibitive properties. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84878065553	β-Cyclodextrin-functionalized hydrophobically associating acrylamide copolymer for enhanced oil recovery	Acrylamide copolymer in the chemical flooding process plays a significant role in the field of tertiary recovery for enhanced oil recovery. Allyl-β-cyclodextrin and octadecyl dimethyl allyl ammonium chloride are utilized to react with acrylamide to synthesize a novel cyclodextrin- functionalized hydrophobically associating acrylamide polymer (HCMPAM) by redox free-radical polymerization. The microstructure of HCMPAM is the spatial network characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy, and the thermal stability of HCMPAM is investigated by thermal gravimetic analysis. In the performance evaluation experiments, HCMPAM demonstrates superior properties compared to the high molecular weight partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide on the aspects of salt tolerance, temperature resistance, shear resistance, and surfactant compatibility. It was found that the viscosity of 2000 mg/L HCMPAM reaches a maximum at 80 C, and it could maintain 45.7% viscosity retention rate at 120 C under the conditions of 20000 mg/L NaCl, 2000 mg/L CaCl

84879438416	The research on the proper production capacity evaluations on the west of Sulige Gas Field	The proper production capacity of an oil/gas field is a critical problem to which development operators attach great importance. It is the foundation for measuring and adjusting a development program. Commonly used production capacity evaluation methods include indicating curves of gas production method, numerical simulation, analysis of unstable yield and mineral production statistics etc. Water producing characteristics of Block Su-59 of Sulige Gas Field were explored. Applying RTA, we evaluated proper production capacity by creating gas well model and by using field production statistical method. Then we discussed the adaptability of the two evaluation methods and evaluated the proration production of Block Su-59. We believe that the research provides the reference for gas well productivity evaluation and the determination of reasonable production of the water-bearing gas reservoirs in the west of Sulige Gas Field.

84880471850	A discussion on how to significantly improve the single-well productivity of CBM gas wells in China	The single-well productivity of CBM gas wells is far below the anticipated level, which severely restricts the CBM gas development in present China. However, the current exploitation theories and technologies seem helpless to solve this problem. In view of this, this paper first analyzed the reasons of the low productivity of CBM gas wells as well as the possible influencing factors. Compared with the US CBM gas reservoirs, those in China have dissatisfactory geological conditions, where free-state methane gas migrate through coal beds driven by desorption and diffusion instead of by percolation. The current exploiting techniques still fail to take good advantage of desorption and diffusion to improve the single-well productivity so they are not completely fit for the CBM gas development in China. From this respect, positive proposals were presented herein. There are two ways for CBM gas engineers to improve the single-well productivity. One is to enlarge the gas discharge area; the other is to speed up the migrating gas from a reservoir to a wellbore. With reference to the volumetric fracturing applied to stimulate the US shale gas reservoirs, it is suggested that the herringbone multilateral wells with the length of 20 - 40 m be first drilled at different directions of a horizontal CBM gas well; then, the fracturing treatment be performed on the multilateral wells one by one or in groups so that the artificial fracture network will be formed to easily "cut" coal beds in the wellbore areas; thus, the ozimuth, length and numbers of multilateral wells be optimally designed to meet the need of the artificially-made fracture network in the wellbore area.

84900002214	Study on nonequilibrium effect of condensate gas reservoir with gaseous water under HT and HP condition	When a condensate gas reservoir with gaseous water under high temperature and high pressure condition is producing, the gaseous water and nonequilibrium effect will have great influences on the phase behavior of condensate oil and gas system and the accumulation of condensate liquid near the wellbore area. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed to investigate phase behavior of the condensate gas reservoirs with gaseous water using a PVT cell, in which the constant volume depletion process of nonequilibrium pressure drop and equilibrium pressure drop within near wellbore zone was simulated. And using the modified PR EOS, PR EOS, and nonequilibrium effect theory, the authors calculated the content of condensate oil and condensate liquid of the nonequilibrium pressure drop and equilibrium pressure drop and compared the calculated results with the experimental data. The results show that the modified PR EOS combined with nonequilibrium effect theory is more suitable for representing phase behavior characteristics of the development process of condensate gas reservoir containing gaseous water, with the average relative error of 4.49%. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate exploiting opportunity and properly increasing the nonequilibrium effect are helpful to increase condensate oil and water recovery. © 2014 Dali Hou et al.

84908020984	Enhanced oil recovery technology of alkaline/surfactant/hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide flooding after polymer flooding	Alkaline/surfactant/hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide (ASP) flooding is an important approach for further improving oil recovery after polymer flooding in Daqing oilfield. For cost-effective improvement of oil recovery efficiency, ASP flooding systems must be able to maintain ultra-low oil-water interfacial tension and substantially increase the sweep efficiency. This study evaluates the performance of an alkylbenzene sulfonate (ABS)-hydrophobically associating polyacrylamide (HAPAM)-sodium hydroxide (NaOH) flooding system by comparison with an ultra-high molecular weight, partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)-ABS-NaOH flooding system. The results show that when the ranges of NaOH and ABS concentrations are respectively 0.5%-1.2% and 0.025%-0.300%, the HAPAM-APS flooding system has high interfacial activity with oil-water interfacial tension decreased to 10

The constitution of APR was identified by IR-spectrometric data. The fluid loss reducing property of APR in salt clay mud, the inhibiting capacity of APR for clay swelling and the compatibility of APR with a weighted amphoteric polymer(FA367 + XY27) mud were investigated and shown to be better than that of commercial sulfomethylated phenolic resin SMP: APR was more temperature resistant and salt tolerent. The adsorption of APR on Na-bentonite was also determined as compared with SMP and the mechanisms involved in functioning of APR as mud additive were discussed on the basis of the adsorption data obtained.

1342264264	The interfacial tension between oil and gemini surfactant solution	The interfacial tensions between oil and solution of cationic gemini surfactants have been measured. It is found that gemini surfactants are more effective and efficient than corresponding conventional surfactants in reducing the interfacial tension and can lower the tension of kerosene-water interface to ultra-low at very low concentration without other additives. It is also found that gemini surfactants can reduce the interfacial tension to ultra-low only at a certain concentration range. The addition of salt results in more effectiveness of surfactant in reducing the tension of kerosene-water interface and shows that gemini surfactant has a good synergism with salt. For crude oil from Zhongyuan Oil Field of China, gemini surfactant is more effective on lowering crude oil-water tension and has an excellent ability in reducing the tension of crude oil-water interface. However, when the oil is hexadecane, ultra-low interfacial tension is not observed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
