17744392230	The evolution of four-body concurrence in the jaynes-cummings model	We realized the four-body approximate W state by the interaction of two atoms and two mode vacuum cavity fields, no matter that the two atoms are initially in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entangled states or in disentangled states. The four-body entanglement changes with the initial state of the system and the detuning degree, What's important is that when the two atoms are initially in Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, the entanglement of atom-atom and field-field can reach a maximal value of 1. Also if the two atoms are initially in disentangled states, the entanglement of atom-atom and field-field won't go beyond 1/2.

33645520153	Development of a theory of quantum action-angle variables with examples	A quantum theory corresponding to the classical theory of action-angle variables is developed and applied to the examples of a harmonic oscillator and an infinite potential well. The quantum state of the system which is canonically connected to the original system, of action-angle variables are obtained. Using those quantum states, we show that the quantum behavior and the expectation values of some physical quantities, including the energy eigenvalues of the original system, can be found without prior knowledge of the quantum state of the original system. From the uncertainties of the quantum operators of the action-angle variable system, a quantum state is interpreted as an amplitude state of the original quantum system.

The same secret message is encoded on each batch of single photons by the sender with two different unitary operations, and then the N batches of single photons are sent to the receiver. After eavesdropping check, the message is encoded on the one remaining batch by the receiver.

58149457203	A fast scheme for one-step preparation of a highly entangled cluster state in the ion-trap system	We propose to implement a highly entangled cluster state (HECS) with only one step based on the resonant interactions among N two-level ions and two different standing-wave lasers with a phase difference of π/2. The time for preparation of the HECS is related only to the frequency of the vibrational mode ν (i.e. t=2π/ν). We can ensure that the preparation time is short enough by setting the larger vibrational mode frequency ν to neglect the effect of the decoherence of the qubits. During the process of preparing the HECS, the heating effect of the vibrational mode can be neglected and the initial qubits need only one evolution with the time interval t. The reduced operation steps and the shorter preparation time make the present scheme more feasible in experiments. © 2008 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The atomic-state entangler is meaningful because it does not need a strong coupling cavity and a single-photon source and could be feasible for large-scale quantum computation and quantum communication in the future. Based on this entangler, quantum information nonlocal transfer without classical communication, the quantum controlled-NOT gate, the four-particle χ state, the N-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, and cluster-state generation can be realized completely, which is useful in large-scale and nonlocal quantum information processing. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

84908139517	Counterfactual distributed controlled-phase gate for quantum-dot spin qubits in double-sided optical microcavities	The existing distributed quantum gates required physical particles to be transmitted between two distant nodes in the quantum network. We here demonstrate the possibility to implement distributed quantum computation without transmitting any particles. We propose a scheme for a distributed controlled-phase gate between two distant quantum-dot electron-spin qubits in optical microcavities. The two quantum-dot-microcavity systems are linked by a nested Michelson-type interferometer. A single photon acting as ancillary resource is sent in the interferometer to complete the distributed controlled-phase gate, but it never enters the transmission channel between the two nodes. Moreover, we numerically analyze the effect of experimental imperfections and show that the present scheme can be implemented with high fidelity in the ideal asymptotic limit. The scheme provides further evidence of quantum counterfactuality and opens promising possibilities for distributed quantum computation.

58249137933	Implementation of grover quantum search via cavity quantum electrodynamics	We propose a scheme for implementing two-qubit Grover quantum search based on the atom-atom dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) and the atom-cavity interaction (ACI) via cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In the scheme, the atoms in the cavity are not required to be addressed individually and all the two-qubit conditional phase operations required to achieve the two-qubit Grover quantum search can be implemented directly in the cavity by choosing the interaction time appropriately. Thus, the scheme does not require any auxiliary single-qubit rotation operations to be performed on the atoms, which leads to potential speed up of the quantum operation and decreases the experimental complexity. Moreover, the scheme is insensitive to both the cavity decay and the thermal field because the photon-number-dependent parts in the evolution operator are canceled with the assistance of a strong classical field. We propose a detailed procedure and experimentally analyze its feasibility.

The π/3.61-phase algorithm can be achieved in O(√N/M) with the success probability of at least 94.11%, which offsets disadvantage that the success probability of getting correct results usually decreases with the increase of marked items when original Grover quantum search algorithm is applied to search an unordered database.

The atoms interact with a highly detuned cavity-field mode, but quantum information does not transfer between the atoms and cavity field, and thus the cavity decay is negligible. The gate time does not rise with an increase in the number of qubits. With the choice of a smaller odd number l (related to atom-cavity coupling constants), the phase gate can be generated with a higher fidelity and a higher success probability in a shorter time (the gate time is much shorter than the atomic radiative lifetime and photon lifetime). When the number of qubits N exceeds certain small values, the fidelity and success probability rise slowly with an increase in the number of qubits N. When N , the fidelity and success probability infinitely approach 1, but never exceed 1. © 2009 Chin. Phys. Soc. and IOP Publishing Ltd.

The whole system is in a star configuration of a spin network and the outer spin qubits construct the decoherence-free state via measuring the state of central spin qubit at intervals of τ repeatedly. An interesting feature is found: namely, that in order to prepare the three-qubit decoherence-free state successfully, the value of τ for the projected time-evolution operator must be set definitely, while this restrictive condition is relaxed for achieving the four-qubit decoherence-free state.

During the generation processes, atomic spontaneous emission and cavity decay are negligible. The scheme is realizable in experiments with current cavity quantum electrodynamics techniques. © 2011 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
