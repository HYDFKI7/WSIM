84928173759	Exogenous thymine DNA glycosylase regulates epigenetic modifications and meiotic cell cycle progression of mouse oocytes	In mammalian cells, 5-methylcytosine (5-meC) can be transformed into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) by the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET proteins (TET1, TET2 and TET3). Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), a downstream enzyme of TET proteins, not only functions in base excision repair, but also acts as a key enzyme that participates in activeDNAdemethylation. Herewe microinjected exogenous TDG-mCherry mRNAs into germinal vesicle (GV) stage mouse oocytes, and found that initially TDG-mCherry localized in the nucleus. Just before GV breakdown (GVBD), TDG-mCherry was released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. In contrast with TDG, another active DNA demethylation-associated enzyme, activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) became localized in the cytoplasm of GV oocytes, but entered the nucleus of oocytes just before GVBD. However, both TDG and AID could enter the G0 stage nuclei of cumulus cells injected into the ooplasm. To analyze the effects of TDG on oocyte maturation, we over-expressed TDG-mCherry in GV oocytes, and found that the rates of both GVBD and polar body extrusion rate were significantly decreased. When the TDG over-expressed oocytes were blocked at theGVstage, the oocyte chromatin became decondensed, and the histone 3 trimethyl lysine 9 (H3K9me3) and H3K9me2 levels were decreased. We also found thatTDG could reduce the 5-meC level of oocyte genomic DNA. All these results indicate that aberrant TDG expression causes epigenetic modifications and meiotic cell cycle arrest of mouse oocytes.

1542300715	Localization of CD9 in pig oocytes and its effects on sperm-egg interaction	CD9 is a cell surface protein that participates in many cellular processes, such as cell adhesion. Fertilization involves sperm and oocyte interactions including sperm binding to oocytes and sperm-oocyte fusion. Thus CD9 may play an essential role during fertilization in mammals. The present study was conducted to examine whether CD9 is present in porcine gametes and whether it participates in the regulation of sperm-oocyte interactions. The presence of CD9 in ovarian tissues, oocytes and spermatozoa was examined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Sperm binding and penetration of oocytes treated with CD9 antibody were examined by in vitro fertilization. The results showed that CD9 was present on the plasma membrane of oocytes at different developmental stages. A 24 kDa protein was found in oocytes during in vitro maturation by immunoblotting and its quantity was significantly (P < 0.001) increased as oocytes underwent maturation and reached the highest level after the oocytes had been cultured for 44 h. No positive CD9 staining was found in the spermatozoa. Both sperm binding to ooplasma and sperm penetration into oocytes were significantly (P< 0.01) reduced in anti-CD9 anti body-treated oocytes (1.2 ± 0.2 per oocyte and 16.6% respectively) as compared with oocytes in the controls (2.5 ± 0.4 per oocyte and 70.3% respectively). These results indicated that CD9 is expressed in pig oocytes during early growth and meiotic maturation and that it participates in sperm-oocyte interactions during fertilization. © 2004 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

1942500125	Sperm penetration of immature and maturing oocytes does not affect phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase in pigs	Pig oocytes cultured in vitro for 0, 25, 33 and 44h were inseminated by frozen-thawed ejaculated sperm. At specified times after insemination, sperm penetration, cell cycle progression and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation were evaluated. It was shown that: (1) oocytes at various maturational stages could be penetrated by sperm; (2) sperm penetration did not affect meiotic cell cycle progression; (3) sperm penetration of germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes and maturing oocytes did not alter MAPK phosphorylation; and (4) when premetaphase I (pre-MI) and metaphase I (MI) oocytes, in which MAPK was activated, were fertilised, no evident MAPK dephosphorylation was detected as in metaphase II oocytes. The data suggest that sperm penetration before oocyte maturation does not affect MAPK phosphorylation and that the machinery inactivating MAPK upon fertilisation is not developed in maturing (pre-MI to MI) oocytes. © CSIRO 2003.

21344469118	DNA hypomethylation of individual sequences in aborted cloned bovine fetuses	Cloned bovines have a much higher abortion rate than those derived in vivo. Available evidence indicates that inappropriate epigenetic reprogramming of donor nuclei is the primary cause of cloning failure. To gain a better understanding of the DNA methylation changes associated with the high abortion rate of cloned bovines, we examined the DNA methylation status of a repeated sequence (satellite I) and the promoter regions of two single-copy genes (interleukin 3/cytokeratin) in aborted cloned fetuses, aborted fetuses derived from artificial insemination (AI), cloned adults and AI adults by bisulfite sequencing and restriction enzyme analysis. Two of four aborted cloned fetuses show very low methylation levels in the two single-copy gene promoter regions. One of the two fetuses also showed undermethylated status in the satellite I sequence. The other two aborted cloned fetuses have similar methylation levels to those of aborted AI fetuses. However, no difference in methylation was observed between cloned adults and AI adults. Our results demonstrate for the first time the undermethylated status of individual sequences in aborted cloned fetuses. These findings suggest that aberrant DNA methylation may contribute to the developmental failure of cloned bovine fetuses.

27144516178	Active demethylation of individual genes in intracytoplasmic sperm injection rabbit embryos	Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), as an assisted reproduction technique, has been widely used in animal and human. However, its possible effect on epigenetic changes has not been well studied. To investigate whether ICSI can induce aberrant DNA methylation changes in rabbit preimplantation embryos, we examined the methylation status of the SP-A promoter region and the satellite sequence Rsat IIE by bisulfite-sequencing technology. The SP-A promoter region was extensively demethylated before the first round of DNA replication commences, and the unmethylated status was maintained until morula when dynamic remethylation occurred. A similar but more moderate demethylation process was observed in satellite sequence Rsat IIE. These results are in contrast with the previous reports of no active demethylation in normal rabbit embryos, suggesting that the active demethylation we observed may be induced by ICSI. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

3042687335	Isolation and culture of pluripotent cells from in vitro produced porcine embryos	The present study was designed to examine whether in vitro produced porcine embryos can be used to establish an embryonic stem (ES) cell line. Porcine embryos were produced by in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilization. Embryos at the 4-cell to blastocyst stages were cultured in an ES medium containing 16% fetal bovine serum with mouse embryonic fibroblasts as a feeder layer. It was found that ES-like colonies were derived only from blastocysts. When these ES-like colonies were separated in 0.25% trypsin-0.02% EDTA solution and cultured again, ES-like colonies were further observed in the subsequent culture until the fourth passage. The cells from ES-like colonies showed positive alkaline phosphatase activity. Some cells from the colonies differentiated into several types of cells in vitro when they were cultured in the medium without feeder layers and leukemin inhibitory factor. Embryoid bodies were also formed when the cells were cultured in a suspension status. These results indicate that porcine ES-like cells can be derived from in vitro produced porcine blastocysts and these ES-like cells are pluripotent. The culture system used in the present study is useful to isolate and culture ES cells from in vitro produced porcine embryos.

33748918711	Histone phosphorylation and pericentromeric histone modifications in oocyte meiosis	Epigenetic regulation of pericentromeric heterochromatin is crucial for proper interactions between kinetochores and spindle microtubules governing accurate chromosome segregation. Here, we first examined the dynamic distribution of phosphorylated serine 10 and 28 on H3 during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development using immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy. Our results revealed strong signals of phosphorylated H3/ser10 and 28 in the pericentromeric heterochromatin area and continuous persistent staining of the chromosome periphery, respectively. A panel of specific antibodies against various acetylated lysine, dimethylated lysine or phosphorylated serine residues on histone H3 or H4 were used to investigate the effects of Trichostatin A (TSA), a general inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), on histone modifications of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Unexpectedly, TSA treatment was unable to alter the acetylation and methylation status of pericentromeric heterochromatin, however, it resulted in significant dephosphorylation of H3/ser10 at this site during mouse oocyte meiosis, which is likely to play a role in the TSA-induced defective chromosome segregation. Furthermore, by using ZM447439, an inhibitor of Aurora kinases, we revealed that Aurora kinases may participate in the regulation of histone phosphorylation during mouse oocyte maturation. ©2006 Landes Bioscience.

33749658977	Bub1 prevents chromosome misalignment and precocious anaphase during mouse oocyte meiosis	In mitosis the checkpoint proteins ensure faithful chromosome segregation by delaying onset of anaphase until all sister chromatids align at the metaphase plate of the bipolar spindle correctly. In the present study we blocked the function of Bub1 during meiosis by microinjecting anti-Bub1 specific antibody into cytoplasm of mouse oocytes, and found that depletion of Bub1 induced evident cyclin B degradation and precocious anaphase onset. Bub1 suppression also overrode the checkpoint-dependent cell cycle arrest provoked by a low dosage of nocodazole. Furthermore, Bub1 depletion induced a significantly higher percentage of oocytes with misaligned chromosomes. In addition, we depicted the localization dynamics of Bub1 in response to spindle damage and its relationship with microtubules and chromosomes, providing further evidence for Bub1's role as a spindle checkpoint protein. Our data suggest that Bub1 is a critical spindle checkpoint protein that regulates accurate chromosome alignment and homolog disjunction in mammalian oocyte meiosis. ©2006 Landes Bioscience.

33751576730	RNA interference as a tool to study the function of MAD2 in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	Spindle checkpoint proteins control entry into anaphase and chromosome segregation. As a member of spindle checkpoint proteins, MAD2 takes a central role in the regulation of anaphase onset and genome integrity. Here, we used MAD2 siRNA transfection approach to study MAD2 functions during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation in vitro. Real-time PCR and laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that we successfully downregulated MAD2 transcript and protein expression. We further demonstrated that MAD2 downregulation resulted in a shortened duration of meiosis I and meiotic spindle abnormality, suggesting the function of MAD2 in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. We also showed that MAD2 interference to some extent decreased GVBD rate, but increased apoptosis in mouse oocytes. In conclusion, our study shows that siRNA transfection is an effective tool to study MAD2 functions, and our results provide further evidence for the role of MAD2 as a spindle checkpoint protein in mouse oocytes. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33847040000	MEK1/2 regulates microtubule organization, spindle pole tethering and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	It is well known that MAPK plays pivotal roles in oocyte maturation, but the function of MEK (MAPK kinase) remains unknown. We have studied the expression, subcellular localization and functional roles of MEK during meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes. Firstly, we found that MEK1/2 phoshorylation (p-MEK1/2, indicative of MEK activation) was low in GV (germinal vesicle) stage, increased 2h after GVBD (germinal vesicle breakdown), and reached the maximum at metaphase II. Secondly, we found that P-MEK1/2 was restricted in the GV prior to GVBD. In prometaphase I and metaphase I, P-MEK1/2 was mainly associated with the spindle, especially with the spindle poles. At anaphase I and telophase I, p-MEK1/2 became diffusely distributed in the region between the separating chromosomes, and then became associated with the midbody. The association of p-MEK1/2 with spindle poles was further confirmed by its colocalization with the centrosomal proteins, γ-tubulin and NuMA. Thirdly, we have investigated the possible functional role of MEK1/2 activation by intravenous administration and intrabursal injection of a specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, and by microinjection of MEK siRNA into oocytes. All these manipulations cause disorganized spindle poles and spindle structure, misaligned chromosomes and larger than normal polar bodies. Our results suggest that MEK1/2 may function as a centrosomal protein and may have roles in microtubule organization, spindle pole tethering and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte maturation. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.

34249704100	Cytoplasmic dynein participates in meiotic checkpoint inactivation in mouse oocytes by transporting cytoplasmic mitotic arrest-deficient (Mad) proteins from kinetochores to spindle poles	The present study was designed to investigate the localization and function of cytoplasmic dynein (dynein) during mouse oocyte meiosis and its relationship with two major spindle checkpoint proteins, mitotic arrest-deficient (Mad) 1 and Mad2. Oocytes at various stages during the first meiosis were fixed and immunostained for dynein, Mad1, Mad2, kinetochores, microtubules, and chromosomes. Some oocytes were treated with nocodazole before examination. Anti-dynein antibody was injected into the oocytes at germinal vesicle (GV) stage before the examination of its effects on meiotic progression or Mad1 and Mad2 localization. Results showed that dynein was present in the oocytes at various stages from GV to metaphase II and the locations of Mad1 and Mad2 were associated with dynein's movement. Both Mad1 and Mad2 had two existing states: one existed in the cytoplasm (cytoplasmic Mad1 or cytoplasmic Mad2), which did not bind to kinetochores, while the other bound to kinetochores (kinetochore Mad1 or kinetochore Mad2). The equilibrium between the two states varied during meiosis and/or in response to the changes of the connection between microtubules and kinetochores. Cytoplasmic Mad1 and Mad2 recruited to chromosomes when the connection between microtubules and chromosomes was destroyed. inhibition of dynein interferes with cytoplasmic Mad1 and Mad2 transportation from chromosomes to spindle poles, thus inhibits checkpoint silence and delays anaphase onset. These results indicate that dynein may play a role in spindle checkpoint inactivation. © 2007 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

34447310017	Dynamic changes in histone acetylation during sheep oocyte maturation	The changes in histone acetylation are not always consistent in various cell types and at different developmental stages. We immunostained specific antibodies against acetylated lysine 9 of histone H3 and acetylated lysines 5 and 12 of histone H4 in an effort to understand the detailed changes in histone acetylation during sheep oocyte meiosis. We found that the acetylation fluorescence signals of H3/K9 and H4/K12 on chromatin appeared intensively in the germinal vesicle (GV), late-GV (L-GV), and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stages and became weak in metaphase I (MI); however staining reappeared in anaphase I-telophase-I (AI-TI) and metaphase II (MII). Furthermore, staining was detected in the first polar bodies. The fluorescence signals of H4/K5 first appeared in the MI stage and became intensive in the AI-TI stage; however they were barely detectable in MII stage chromosomes and first polar bodies. We conclude that the acetylation patterns of H3/K9 and H4/K12 during oocyte meiotic maturation are similar and that the pattern of H4/K5 is unique.

36849090207	Distribution and expression of phosphorylated histone H3 during porcine oocyte maturation	Phosphorylation modification of core histones is correlated well with diverse chromatin-based cell activities. However, its distribution pattern and primary roles during mammalian oocyte meiosis are still in dispute. In this study, by performing immunofluorescence and Western blotting, spatial distribution and temporal expression of phosphorylated serine 10 or 28 on histone H3 during porcine oocyte meiotic maturation were examined and distinct subcellular distribution patterns between them were presented. Low expression of phosphorylated H3/ ser10 was detected in germinal vesicle. Importantly, following gradual dephosphorylation from germinal vesicle (GV) to late germinal vesicle (L-GV) stage, a transient phosphorylation at the periphery of condensed chromatin was re-established at early germinal vesicle breakdown (E-GVBD) stage, and then the dramatically increased signals covered whole chromosomes from pre-metaphase I (Pre-MI) to metaphase II (MII). Similarly, hypophosphorylation of serine 28 on histone H3 was also monitored from GV to E-GVBD, indicating dephosphorylation of histone H3 maybe involved in the regulation of meiotic resumption. Moreover, the rim staining on the chromosomes and high levels of H3/ser28 phosphorylation were observed in Pre-MI, MI, and MII stage oocytes. Based on above results, such stage-dependent dynamics of phosphorylation of H3/ser 10 and 28 may play specific roles during mammalian oocyte maturation. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

38149068981	Diploid parthenogenetic embryos adopt a maternal-type methylation pattern on both sets of maternal chromosomes	Epigenetic modifications are closely associated with embryo developmental potential. One of the epigenetic modifications thought to be involved in genomic imprinting is DNA methylation. Here we show that the maternally imprinted genes Snrpn and Peg1/Mest were nearly unmethylated or heavily methylated, respectively, in their differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at the two-cell stage in parthenogenetic embryos. However, both genes were gradually de novo methylated, with almost complete methylation of all CpG sites by the morula stage in parthenogenetic embryos. Unexpectedly, another maternally imprinted gene, Peg3, showed distinct dynamics of methylation during preimplantation development of diploid parthenogenetic embryos. Peg3 showed seemingly normal methylation patterns at the two-cell and morula stages, but was also strongly de novo methylated in parthenogenetic blastocysts. In contrast, the paternally imprinted genes H19 and Rasgrf1 showed complete unmethylation of their DMRs at the morula stage in parthenogenetic embryos. These results indicate that diploid parthenogenetic embryos adopt a maternal-type methylation pattern on both sets of maternal chromosomes and that the aberrantly homogeneous status of methylation imprints may partially account for developmental failure. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

38349112273	Regulation of intracellular MEK1/2 translocation in mouse oocytes cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin-mediated poleward transport and cyclin B degradation-dependent release from spindle poles	We recently reported that MEK1/2 plays an important role in microtubule organization and spindle pole tethering in mouse oocytes, but how the intracellular transport of this protein is regulated remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms of poleward MEK1/2 transport during the prometaphase I/metaphase I transition and MEK1/2 release from the spindle poles during the metaphase I/anaphase I transition in mouse oocytes. Firstly, we found that p-MEK1/2 was colocalized with dynactin at the spindle poles. Inhibition of the cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin complex by antibody microinjection blocked polar accumulation of p-MEK1/2 and caused obvious spindle abnormalities. Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation of p-MEK1/2 and dynein or dynactin from mouse oocyte extracts confirmed their association at metaphase I. Secondly, disruption of microtubules by nocodazole resulted in the failure of poleward p-MEK1/2 transport. Whereas, when the nocodazole-treated oocytes were recovered in fresh culture medium, the spindle reformed and p-MEK1/2 relocalized to the spindle poles. Finally, we examined the mechanism of p-MEK1/2 release from the spindle poles. In control oocytes, polar p-MEK1/2 was gradually released during metaphase I/anaphase I transition. By contrast, in the presence of nondegradable cyclin B (D90), p-MEK1/2 still remained at the spindle poles at anaphase I. Our results indicate that poleward MEK1/2 transport is a cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin-mediated and spindle microtubule-dependent intracellular movement, and that its subsequent anaphase release from spindle poles is dependent on cyclin B degradation. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.

40049089071	Aberrant DNA methylation imprints in aborted bovine clones	Genomic imprinting plays a very important role during development and its abnormality may heavily undermine the developmental potential of bovine embryos. Because of limited resources of the cow genome, bovine genomic imprinting, both in normal development and in somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) cloning, is not well documented. DNA methylation is thought to be a major factor for the establishment of genomic imprinting. In our study, we determined the methylation status of differential methylated regions (DMRs) of four imprinted genes in four spontaneously aborted SCNT-cloned fetuses (AF). Firstly, abnormal methylation imprints were observed in each individual to different extents. In particular, Peg3 and MAOA were either seriously demethylated or showed aberrant methylation patterns in four aborted clones we tested, but Xist and Peg10 exhibited relatively better maintained methylation status in AF1 and AF4. Secondly, two aborted fetuses, AF2 and AF3 exhibited severe aberrant methylation imprints of four imprinted genes. Finally, MAOA showed strong heterogeneous methylation patterns of its DMR in normal somatic adult tissue, but largely variable methylation levels and relatively homogeneous methylation patterns in aborted cloned fetuses. Our data indicate that the aborted cloned fetuses exhibited abnormal methylation imprints, to different extent, in aborted clones, which partially account for the higher abortion and developmental abnormalities during bovine cloning. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

33645703304	Histone deacetylation is required for orderly meiosis	Histone acetylation is associated with a diversity of chromatin-related processes in mitosis. However, its roles in mammalian oocyte meiosis are largely unknown. In the present study, we first investigated in detail the acetylation changes during porcine oocyte maturation using a panel of antibodies specific for the critical acetylated forms of histone H3 and H4, and showed meiosis stage-dependent and lysine residue-specific patterns of histone acetylation. By using trichostatin A (TSA), a general inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we further determined that selective inhibition of histone deacetylation (thereby maintaining hyperacetylation) delayed the onset of germinal vesicle breakdown and produced a high frequency of lagging chromosomes or chromatin bridges at anaphase and telophase I (AT-I), suggesting that histone deacetylation is required for orderly meiotic resumption and accurate chromosome segregation in porcine oocytes. In addition, we examined the localization and expression of HDAC1 by performing immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analysis. The results showed that subcellular translocation, expression level and phosphorylated modification of HDAC1 were temporally regulated and likely to coparticipate in the establishment of histone acetylation profiles in oocyte meiosis. ©2006 Landes Bioscience.

40449103460	Mitochondrial behavior during oogenesis in zebrafish: A confocal microscopy analysis	The behavior of mitochondria during early oogenesis remains largely unknown in zebrafish. We used three mitochondrial probes (Mito Tracker Red CMXRos, Mito Tracker Green FM, and JC-1) to stain early zebrafish oocyte mitochondria, and confocal microscopy to analyze mitochondrial aggregation and distribution. By using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we traced mitochondrial movement. The microtubule assembly inhibitor nocodazole and microfilament inhibitor cytochalasin B (CB) were used to analyze the role of microtubules and microfilaments on mitochondrial movement. By using the dual emission probe, JC-1, and oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler, carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), we determined the distribution of active and inactive (low-active) mitochondria. Green/red fluorescence ratios of different sublocations in different oocyte groups stained by JC-1 were detected in merged (green and red) images. Our results showed that mitochondria exhibited a unique distribution pattern in early zebrafish oocytes. They tended to aggregate into large clusters in early stage I oocytes, but in a threadlike state in latter stage I oocytes. We detected a lower density mitochondrial area and a higher density mitochondrial area on opposite sides of the germinal vesicle. The green/red fluorescence ratios in different sublocations in normal oocytes were about 1:1. This implies that active mitochondria were distributed in all sublocations. FCCP treatment caused significant increases in the ratios. CB and nocodazole treatment caused an increase of the ratios in clusters and mitochondrial cloud, but not in dispersed areas. Mitochondria in different sublocations underwent fast dynamic movement. Inhibition or disruption of microtubules or microfilaments resulted in even faster mitochondrial free movement. © 2008 The Authors.

79952371679	Icaritin causes sustained ERK1/2 activation and induces apoptosis in human endometrial cancer cells	Icaritin, a compound from Epimedium Genus, has selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulating activities, and posses anti-tumor activity. Here, we examined icaritin effect on cell growth of human endometrial cancer Hec1A cells and found that icaritin potently inhibited proliferation of Hec1A cells. Icaritin-inhibited cell growth was associated with increased levels of p21 and p27 expression and reduced cyclinD1 and cdk 4 expression. Icaritin also induced cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspases as evidenced by the cleavage of endogenous substrate Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and cytochrome c release, which was abrogated by pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Icaritin treatment also induced expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax with a concomitant decrease of Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, icaritin induced sustained phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (the MAPK/ ERK1/2) in Hec1A cells and U0126, a specific MAP kinase kinase (MEK1/2) inhibitor, blocked the ERK1/2 activation by icaritin and abolished the icaritin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that icaritin induced sustained ERK 1/2 activation and inhibited growth of endometrial cancer Hec1A cells, and provided a rational for preclinical and clinical evaluation of icaritin for endometrial cancer therapy. © 2011 Tong et al.

80052961706	Septin1 is required for spindle assembly and chromosome congression in mouse oocytes	The bipolar spindle is a complex molecular machinery that drives chromosome congression and segregation. During meiosis in the mouse multiple microtubule organizing centers aggregate to form a bipolar intermediate followed by elongation and establishment of the barrel-shaped acentriolar meiotic spindle. Previous studies have shown that septin1 is localized to spindle poles in mitosis, suggesting its possible involvement in spindle assembly. We, therefore, asked whether perturbation of septin1 will impair the process of spindle assembly and investigated localization and function during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Septin1 was localized to the spindle at metaphase and at the midbody during cytokinesis. Disruption of septin1 function using siRNA caused a decrease in PBE and extensive spindle defects. Moreover, the process of chromosome congression was impaired. However, septin1 depletion did not cause aneuploidy in oocyte with an extruded polar body. Taken together, our results show that septin1 is a key player in spindle assembly and chromosome congression in mouse meiosis. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84877147453	Overexpression of SETβ, a protein localizing to centromeres, causes precocious separation of chromatids during the first meiosis of mouse oocytes	Chromosome segregation in mammalian oocyte meiosis is an error-prone process, and any mistake in this process may result in aneuploidy, which is the main cause of infertility, abortion and many genetic diseases. It is now well known that shugoshin and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) play important roles in the protection of centromeric cohesion during the first meiosis. PP2A can antagonize the phosphorylation of rec8, a member of the cohesin complex, at the centromeres and thus prevent cleavage of rec8 and so maintain the cohesion of chromatids. SETβ is a protein that physically interacts with shugoshin and inhibits PP2A activity. We thus hypothesized that SETβ might regulate cohesion protection and chromosome segregation during oocyte meiotic maturation. Here we report for the first time the expression, subcellular localization and functions of SETβ during mouse oocyte meiosis. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the expression level of SETβ was stable from the germinal vesicle stage to the MII stage of oocyte meiosis. Immunofluorescence analysis showed SETβ accumulation in the nucleus at the germinal vesicle stage, whereas it was targeted mainly to the inner centromere area and faintly localized to the interchromatid axes from germinal vesicle breakdown to MI stages. At the MII stage, SETβ still localized to the inner centromere area, but could relocalize to kinetochores in a process perhaps dependent on the tension on the centromeres. SETβ partly colocalized with PP2A at the inner centromere area. Overexpression of SETβ in mouse oocytes caused precocious separation of sister chromatids, but depletion of SETβ by RNAi showed little effects on the meiotic maturation process. Taken together, our results suggest that SETβ, even though it localizes to centromeres, might not be essential for chromosome separation during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation, although its forced overexpression causes premature chromatid separation. © 2013.

42649120149	PI3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase in cumulus cells mediate EGF-induced meiotic resumption of porcine oocyte	Previous studies have shown that epidermal growth factor (EGF) has the ability to promote in vitro cultured porcine oocyte maturation. However, little is known about the detailed downstream events in EGF-induced meiotic resumption. We designed this study to determine the relationship of EGF, EGFR, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), MAPK, and germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) during oocyte maturation. Our results showed that GVBD in cumulus-enclosed oocytes (CEOs) but not in denuded oocytes (DOs) was induced by EGF in a dose-dependent manner, which indicated that cumulus cells but not oocyte itself were the main target for EGF-induced meiotic resumption. Furthermore, we found that MAPK in cumulus cells rather than in oocyte was activated immediately after EGF administration. To explore whether EGF exerts its functions through MAPK pathway, the activities of EGF receptor (EGFR) and MAPK were inhibited by employing AG1478 and U0126, respectively. Inhibition of MAPK blocked EGF-induced GVBD, whereas inhibition of EGFR prevented MAPK activation. Both AG1478 and U0126 could lead to the failure of EGF-induced GVBD singly. Notably, we found that LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase, effectively inhibited EGF-induced MAPK activation as well as subsequent oocyte meiotic resumption and this inhibition could not be reversed by adding additional EGF. Thus, PI3-kinase-induced MAPK activation in cumulus cells mediated EGF-induced meiotic resumption in porcine CEOs. Together, this study provides evidences demonstrating a linear relationship of EGF/EGFR, PI3-kinase, MAPK and GVBD and presents a relatively definitive mechanism of EGF-induced meiotic resumption of porcine oocyte. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

42749097505	Loss of methylation imprint of Snrpn in postovulatory aging mouse oocyte	Prolonged residence of postovulatory oocyte in the oviduct or prolonged culture in vitro can lead to oocyte aging, which significantly affects pre- and post-implantation embryo development. In this study, we employed bisulfite sequencing and COBRA methods to investigate the DNA methylation status of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of Snrpn and Peg1/Mest, two maternally imprinted genes, in postovulatory oocytes aged in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that Snrpn DMR was clearly demethylated in oocytes aged in vivo at 29 h post-hCG and in denuded oocytes aged in vitro for the same time period. However, Peg1/Mest did not show any demethylation in all aged groups at 29 h post-hCG. These data indicate that oocytes undergo time-dependent demethylation of Snrpn DMR during the process of postovulatory aging. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

4243155188	Intra-oocyte localization of MAD2 and its relationship with kinetochores, microtubules, and chromosomes in rat oocytes during meiosis	The present study was designed to investigate subcellular localization of MAD2 in rat oocytes during meiotic maturation and its relationship with kinetochores, chromosomes, and microtubules. Oocytes at germinal vesicle (GV), prometaphase I (ProM-I), metaphase I (M-I), anaphase I (A-I), telophase I (T-I), and metaphase II (M-II) 1) were fixed and immunostained for MAD2, kinetochores, microtubules and chromosomes. The stained oocytes were examined by confocal microscopy. Some oocytes from GV to M-II stages were treated by a microtubule disassembly drug, nocodazole, or treated by a microtubule stabilizer, Taxol, before examination. Anti-MAD2 antibody was also injected into the oocytes at GV stage and the injected oocytes were cultured for 6 h for examination of chromosome alignment and spindle formation. It was found that MAD2 was at the kinetochores in the oocytes at GV and ProM-I stages. Once the oocytes reached M-I stage in which an intact spindle was formed and all chromosomes were aligned at the equator of the spindle, MAD2 disappeared. However, when oocytes from GV to M-II stages were treated by nocodazole, spindles were destroyed and MAD2 was observed in all treated oocytes. When nocodazole-treated oocytes at M-I and M-II stages were washed and cultured for spindle recovery, it was found that, once the relationship between microtubules and chromosomes was established, MAD2 disappeared in the oocytes even though some chromosomes were not aligned at the equator of the spindle. On the other hand, when oocytes were treated with Taxol, MAD2 localization was not changed and was the same as that in the control. However, immunoblotting of MAD2 indicated that MAD2 was present in the oocytes at all stages; nocodazole and Taxol treatment did not influence the quantity of MAD2 in the cytoplasm. Significantly higher proportions of anti-MAD2 antibody-injected oocytes proceeded to premature A-I stage and more oocytes had misaligned chromosomes in the spindles. The present study indicates that MAD2 is a spindle checkpoint protein in rat oocytes during meiosis. When the spindle was destroyed by nocodazole, MAD2 was reactivated in the oocytes to overlook the attachment between chromosomes and microtubules. However, in this case, MAD2 could not check unaligned chromosomes in the recovered spindles, suggesting that a normal chromosome alignment is maintained only in the oocytes without any microtubule damages during maturation.

44949133132	Heat stress causes aberrant DNA methylation of H19 and Igf-2r in mouse blastocysts	To gain a better understanding of the methylation imprinting changes associated with heat stress in early development, we used bisulfite sequencing and bisulfite restriction analysis to examine the DNA methylation status of imprinted genes in early embryos (blastocysts). The paternal imprinted genes, H19 and Igf-2r, had lower methylation levels in heat-stressed embryos than in control embryos, whereas the maternal imprinted genes, Peg3 and Peg1, had similar methylation pattern in heat-stressed embryos and in control embryos. Our results indicate that heat stress may induce aberrant methylation imprinting, which results in developmental failure of mouse embryos, and that the effects of heat shock on methylation imprinting may be gene-specific. © KSMCB 2008.

46749087115	Regulation of peripheral spindle movement and spindle rotation during mouse oocyte meiosis: New perspectives	Spindle movement, including spindle migration during first meiosis and spindle rotation during second meiosis, is essential for asymmetric divisions in mouse oocytes. Previous studies by others and us have shown that microfilaments are required for both spindle migration and rotation. In the present study, we aimed to further investigate the mechanism controlling spindle movement during mouse oocyte meiosis. By employing drug treatment and immunofluorescence microscopy, we showed that dynamic microtubule assembly was involved in both spindle migration and rotation. Furthermore, we found that the calcium/CaM/CaMKII pathway was important for regulating spindle rotation. Copyright © Microscopy Society of America 2008.

47249154406	Involvement of Polo-like kinase 1 in MEK1/2-regulated spindle formation during mouse oocyte meiosis	Our recent studies have shown that MEK1/2 is a critical regulator of microtubule organization and spindle formation during oocyte meiosis. In the present study, we found that Plk1 colocalized with p-MEK1/2 at various meiotic stages after GVBD when microtubule began to organize. Also, Plk1 was able to coimmunoprecipitate with p-MEK1/2 in metaphase I stage mouse oocyte extracts, further confirming their physical interaction. Taxol-treated oocytes exhibited a number of cytoplasmic asters, in which both Plk1 and p-MEK1/2 were present, indicating that they might be complexed to participate in the acentrosomal spindle formation at the MTOCs during oocyte meiosis. Depolymerization of microtubules by nocodazole resulted in the complete disassembly of spindles, but Plk1 remained associated with p-MEK1/2, accumulating in the vicinity of chromosomes. More importantly, when p-MEK1/2 activity was blocked by U0126, Plk1 lost its normal localization at the spindle poles, which might be one of the most vital factors causing the abnormal spindles in MEK1/2-inhibited oocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that Plk1 and MEK1/2 regulate the spindle formation in the same pathway and that Plk1 is involved in MEK1/2-regulated spindle assembly during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. ©2008 Landes Bioscience.

51549094149	Aberrant DNA methylation in 5′ regions of DNA methyltransferase genes in aborted bovine clones	High rate of abortion and developmental abnormalities is thought to be closely associated with inefficient epigenetic reprogramming of the transplanted nuclei during bovine cloning. It is known that one of the important mechanisms for epigenetic reprogramming is DNA methylation. DNA methylation is established and maintained by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), therefore, it is postulated that the inefficient epigenetic reprogramming of transplanted nuclei may be due to abnormal expression of DNMTs. Since DNA methylation can strongly inhibit gene expression, aberrant DNA methylation of DNMT genes may disturb gene expression. But presently, it is not clear whether the methylation abnormality of DNMT genes is related to developmental failure of somatic cell nuclear transfer embryos. In our study, we analyzed methylation patterns of the 5′ regions of four DNMT genes including Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Dnmt1 and Dnmt2 in four aborted bovine clones. Using bisulfite sequencing method, we found that 3 out of 4 aborted bovine clones (AF1, AF2 and AF3) showed either hypermethylation or hypomethylation in the 5′ regions of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, indicating that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b genes are not properly reprogrammed. However, the individual AF4 exhibited similar methylation level and pattern to age-matched in vitro fertilized (IVF) fetuses. Besides, we found that the 5′ regions of Dnmt1 and Dnmt2 were nearly completely unmethylated in all normal adults, IVF fetuses, sperm and aborted clones. Together, our results suggest that the aberrant methylation of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b 5′ regions is probably associated with the high abortion of bovine clones. © 2008 Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology and the Genetics Society of China.

55849151644	Shugoshin1 may play important roles in separation of homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids during mouse oocyte meiosis	Background: Homologous chromosomes separate in meiosis I and sister chromatids separate in meiosis II, generating haploid gametes. To address the question why sister chromatids do not separate in meiosis I, we explored the roles of Shogoshin1 (Sgo1) in chromosome separation during oocyte meiosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sgo1 function was evaluated by exogenous overexpression to enhance its roles and RNAi to suppress its roles during two meioses of mouse oocytes. Immunocytochemistry and chromosome spread were used to evaluate phenotypes. The exogenous Sgo1 overexpression kept homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids not to separate in meiosis I and meiosis II, respectively, while the Sgo1 RNAi promoted premature separation of sister chromatids. Conclusions: Our results reveal that prevention of premature separation of sister chromatids in meiosis I requires the retention of centromeric Sgo1, while normal separation of sister chromatids in meiosis II requires loss of centromeric Sgo1. © 2008 Yin et al.

55549140807	Testosterone potentially triggers meiotic resumption by activation of intra-oocyte SRC and MAPK in porcine oocytes	The role of androgen and androgen receptors (ARs) in males has been well established. This steroid and its receptor also exist in follicles, but their functions are still unclear. In this study, using a culture system containing a low dose of hypoxanthine, we revealed the positive contribution of testosterone to oocyte meiotic resumption. By performing ultracentrifugation to allow clear visualization of porcine germinal vesicles, our results provide evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the oocyte itself but not in cumulus cells was activated before germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after testosterone treatment. We further explored the signal cascade of testosterone-triggered GVBD and showed significant contributions of AR to testosterone-induced MAPK activation and GVBD. By using a potent and selective inhibitor of SRC and detecting activation of the kinase, we found that testosterone activated SRC in oocytes but not in cumulus cells and that SRC (as an essential upstream molecule of MAPK) mediated this testosterone- and AR-promoted reinitiation of meiosis. The present findings propose an undefined signaling pathway and suggest the potential competence of testosterone for meiotic resumption in mammalian oocytes. © 2008 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

7244254391	Improved isolation and culture of embryonic stem cells from Chinese miniature pig	Pigs serve as a better research model for human beings than other species. The Chinese laboratory miniature pig is a new laboratory animal and is expected to be applicable in many medical research fields. This study was to establish effective technologies to isolate and culture ES cells in Chinese miniature pigs. For isolation of the inner cell mass from blastocysts, an enzyme-digestive method was compared with the traditional immunosurgery. Isolated ICM were cultured in three feeder cell layers: mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), porcine embryonic fibroblasts (PEF) and a continuous cell line of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (STO). Microtubule activity of the three feeder cells was further examined by immunofluorescence. ICM were successfully isolated from 85% of blastocysts by the enzyme-digestive method, compared to only 40% by immunosurgery. When ICM were cultured in three feeder layers for two to three days, 75%, 65% and 20% of ICMs formed primary cell colonies in MEF, PEF and STO, respectively. Colonies were also formed during subcultures after 9, 5 and 1 passage in MEF, PEF and STO, respectively. Microtubules in STO cells were significantly fewer than those in MEF and PEF. When the ES-like cells were cultured in a differentiation medium, they differentiated to neuron-like cells and other types of cells. These results indicate that healthier ICM can be obtained with the enzyme-digestive method. Successful culture of ICM to ES-like cells has been achieved not only in MEF, but also in homologous (pig) feeder layer. The ES cells obtained in the present study were pluripotent.

77953595988	Localization and function of mSpindly during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	Spindly was first identified in Drosophila; its homologues are termed SPDL-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Hs Spindly/ hSpindly in humans. In all species, Spindly and its homologues function by recruiting dynein to kinetochores and silencing SAC in mitosis of somatic cells. Depletion of Spindly causes an extensive metaphase arrest during somatic mitoses in Drosophila, C. elegans and humans. In Drosophila, Spindly is required for shedding of Rod and Mad2 from the kinetochores in metaphase; in C. elegans, SPDL-1 presides over the recruitment of dynein and MDF-1 to the kinetochores; in humans, Hs Spindly is required for recruiting both dynein and dynactin to kinetochores but it is dispensable for removal of checkpoint proteins from kinetochores. The present study was designed to investigate the localization and function of the Spindly homologue (mSpindly) during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation by immunofluorescent analysis, and by overexpression and knockdown of mSpindly. We found that mSpindly was typically localized to kinetochores when chromatin condensed into chromosomes after GVBD. In metaphase of both first meiosis and second meiosis, mSpindly was localized not only to kinetochores but also to the spindle poles. Overexpression of mSpindly did not affect meiotic progression, but its depletion resulted in an arrest of the pro-MI/MI stage, failure of anaphase entry and subsequent polar body emission, and in abnormal spindle morphology and misaligned chromosomes. Our data suggest that mSpindly participates in SAC silencing and in spindle formation as a recruiter and/or a transporter of kinetochore proteins in mouse oocytes, but that it needs to cooperate with other factors to fulfill its function. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

77953602174	Septin2 is modified by SUMOylation and required for chromosome congression in mouse oocytes	In mitosis, centrosomes nucleate microtubules that capture the sister kinetochores of each chromosome to facilitate chromosome congression. In contrast, during meiosis chromosome congression on the acentrosomal spindle is driven primarily by movement of chromosomes along laterally associated microtubule bundles. previous studies have indicated that septin2 is required for chromosome congression and cytokinesis in mitosis, we therefore asked whether perturbation of septin2 would impair chromosome congression and cytokinesis in meiosis. We have investigated its expression, localization and function during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Septin2 was modified by SUMO-1 and its levels remained constant from GVBD to metaphase II stages. Septin2 was localized along the entire spindle at metaphase and at the midbody in cytokinesis. Disruption of septins function with an inhibitor and siRNA caused failure of the metaphase I/anaphase I transition and chromosome misalignment but inhibition of septins after the metaphase I stage did not affect cytokinesis. BubR1, a core component of the spindle checkpoint, was labeled on misaligned chromosomes and on chromosomes aligned at the metaphase plate in inhibitor-treated oocytes that were arrested in prometaphase I/metaphase I, suggesting activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. taken together, our results demonstrate that septin2 plays an important role in chromosome congression and meiotic cell cycle progression but not cytokinesis in mouse oocytes. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

77955465487	The SUMO pathway functions in mouse oocyte maturation	Sumoylation is an important posttranslational modification in which SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier) proteins are bonded covalently to their substrates. Studies on the roles of sumoylation in cell cycle regulation have been emerging in both mitosis from yeast to mammals and meiosis in budding yeast, but the functions of sumoylation in mammalian meiosis, especially in oocyte meiotic maturation are not well known. Here, we examined the localization and expression of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, the two basic proteins in the sumoylation pathway and investigated their roles through overexpression of Senp2 during mouse oocyte maturation. Immunofluorescent staining revealed differential patterns of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 localization: SUMO-1 was localized to the spindle poles in prometaphase I, MI and MII stages, around the separating homologues in anaphase I and telophase I stages of first meiosis, while SUMO-2/3 was mainly concentrated near centromeres during mouse oocyte maturation. Immunoblot analysis uncovered the different expression profiles of SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3 modified proteins during mouse oocyte maturation. Overexpression of Senp2, a SUMO-specific isopeptidase, caused changes of SUMO-modified proteins and led to defects in MII spindle organization in mature eggs. These results suggest that the SUMO pathway may play an indispensable role during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

77956201045	MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 is required for mouse meiotic spindle assembly and kinetochore-microtubule attachment	MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a direct substrate of p38 MAPK, plays key roles in multiple physiological functions in mitosis. Here, we show for the first time the unique distribution pattern of MK2 in meiosis. Phospho-MK2 was localized on bipolar spindle minus ends and along the interstitial axes of homologous chromosomes extending over centromere regions and arm regions at metaphase of first meiosis (MI stage) in mouse oocytes. At metaphase of second meiosis (MII stage), p-MK2 was localized on the bipolar spindle minus ends and at the inner centromere region of sister chromatids as dots. Knockdown or inhibition of MK2 resulted in spindle defects. Spindles were surrounded by irregular nondisjunction chromosomes, which were arranged in an amphitelic or syntelic/monotelic manner, or chromosomes detached from the spindles. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments were impaired in MK2-deficient oocytes because spindle microtubules became unstable in response to cold treatment. In addition, homologous chromosome segregation and meiosis progression were inhibited in these oocytes. Our data suggest that MK2 may be essential for functional meiotic bipolar spindle formation, chromosome segregation and proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

77958594027	ERK3 is required for metaphase-anaphase transition in mouse oocyte meiosis	RK3 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 3) is an atypical member of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family of serine/threonine kinases. Little is known about its function in mitosis, and even less about its roles in mammalian oocyte meiosis. In the present study, we examined the localization, expression and functions of ERK3 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Immunofluorescent analysis showed that ERK3 localized to the spindles from the pre-MI stage to the MII stage. ERK3 co-localized with α-tubulin on the spindle fibers and asters in oocytes after taxol treatment. Deletion of ERK3 by microinjection of ERK3 morpholino (ERK3 MO) resulted in oocyte arrest at the MI stage with severely impaired spindles and misaligned chromosomes. Most importantly, the spindle assembly checkpoint protein BubR1 could be detected on kinetochores even in oocytes cultured for 10 h. Low temperature treatment experiments indicated that ERK3 deletion disrupted kinetochore-microtubule (K-MT) attachments. Chromosome spreading experiments showed that knock-down of ERK3 prevented the segregation of homologous chromosomes. Our data suggest that ERK3 is crucial for spindle stability and required for the metaphase-anaphase transition in mouse oocyte maturation. © 2010 Li et al.

78149476449	ER-α36, a novel variant of ER-α, mediates estrogen stimulated proliferation of endometrial carcinoma cells via the PKCδ/ERK pathway	Background: Recently, a variant of ER-α, ER-α36 was identified and cloned. ER-α36 lacks intrinsic transcription activity and mainly mediates non-genomic estrogen signaling. The purpose of this study was to investigate the function and the underlying mechanisms of ER-α36 in growth regulation of endometrial Ishikawa cancer cells. Methods: The cellular localization of ER-α36 and ER-a66 were determined by immunofluorescence in the Ishikawa cells. Ishikawa endometrial cancer control cells transfected with an empty expression vector, Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-α36 (Ishikawa/RNAiER36) and Ishikawa cells with shRNA knockdown of ER-α66 (Ishikawa/RNAiER66) were treated with E2 and E2-conjugated to bovine serum albumin (E2-BSA, membrane impermeable) in the absence and presence of different kinase inhibitors HBDDE, bisindolylmaleimide, rottlerin, H89 and U0126. The phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules and cyclin D1/cdk4 expression were examined with Western blot analysis and cell growth was monitored with the MTT assay. Results: Immunofluorescence staining of Ishikawa cells demonstrated that ER-α36 was expressed mainly on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm, while ER-α66 was predominantly localized in the cell nucleus. Both E2 and E2-BSA rapidly activated PKCδ not PKCa in Ishikawa cells, which could be abrogated by ER-α36 shRNA expression. E2-and E2-BSA-induced ERK phosphorylation required ER-α36 and PKCd. However, only E2 was able to induce Camp-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation. Furthermore, E2 enhances cyclin D1/cdk4 expression via ER-α36. Conclusion: E2 activates the PKCd/ERK pathway and enhances cyclin D1/cdk4 expression via the membrane-initiated signaling pathways mediated by ER-α36, suggesting a possible involvement of ER-α36 in E2-dependent growth-promoting effects in endometrial cancer cells. © 2010 Tong et al.

78650163904	Short-term preservation of porcine oocytes in ambient temperature: Novel approaches	The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of preserving porcine oocytes without freezing. To optimize preservation conditions, porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were preserved in TCM-199, porcine follicular fluid (pFF) and FCS at different temperatures (4°C, 20°C, 25°C, 27.5°C, 30°C and 38.5°C) for 1 day, 2 days or 3 days. After preservation, oocyte morphology, germinal vesicle (GV) rate, actin cytoskeleton organization, cortical granule distribution, mitochondrial translocation and intracellular glutathione level were evaluated. Oocyte maturation was indicated by first polar body emission and spindle morphology after in vitro culture. Strikingly, when COCs were stored at 27.5°C for 3 days in pFF or FCS, more than 60% oocytes were still arrested at the GV stage and more than 50% oocytes matured into MII stages after culture. Almost 80% oocytes showed normal actin organization and cortical granule relocation to the cortex, and approximately 50% oocytes showed diffused mitochondria distribution patterns and normal spindle configurations. While stored in TCM- 199, all these criteria decreased significantly. Glutathione (GSH) level in the pFF or FCS group was higher than in the TCM- 199 group, but lower than in the non-preserved control group. The preserved oocytes could be fertilized and developed to blastocysts (about 10%) with normal cell number, which is clear evidence for their retaining the developmental potentiality after 3d preservation. Thus, we have developed a simple method for preserving immature pig oocytes at an ambient temperature for several days without evident damage of cytoplasm and keeping oocyte developmental competence. © 2010 Yang et al.

79957886687	GM130, a cis-Golgi protein, regulates meiotic spindle assembly and asymmetric division in mouse oocyte	GM130, a cis-Golgi protein, plays key roles in various mitotic events, but its function in mammalian oocyte meiosis remains unknown. In this study, we found that GM130 was localized to the spindle poles at both metaphase I and metaphase II stages and associated with the midbody at telophase I stage. The association of GM130 with spindle poles was further confirmed by its colocalization with the centrosome-associated proteins, MEK1/2. By nocodazole treatment, we clarified that GM130 localization was consistently dependent on spindle assembly. Then we investigated the possible function of GM130 by specific morpholino microinjection. This treatment caused abnormal spindle formation and decreased first polar body extrusion. Our results showed that knockdown of GM130 impaired the localization of MTOCs proteins γ-tubulin and Plk1. Using live cell imaging we observed that depletion of GM130 affected spindle migration and resulted in elongated spindle and large polar body extrusion. We further found that depletion of GM130 blocked p-MEK1/2 accumulation at the spindle poles. And, it was shown that GM130 detached from the spindle poles in oocytes treated with MEK specific inhibitor U0126. Taken together, our results suggested that GM130 regulates microtubule organization and might cooperate with the MAPK pathway to play roles in spindle organization, migration and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte maturation. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.

79959617241	Spindle assembly checkpoint regulates mitotic cell cycle progression during preimplantation embryo development	Errors in chromosome segregation or distribution may result in aneuploid embryo formation, which causes implantation failure, spontaneous abortion, genetic diseases, or embryo death. Embryonic aneuploidy occurs when chromosome aberrations are present in gametes or early embryos. To date, it is still unclear whether the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is required for the regulation of mitotic cell cycle progression to ensure mitotic fidelity during preimplantation development. In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of SAC components (Bub3, BubR1 and Mad2) in mouse preimplantation embryos. Our data showed that overexpressed SAC components inhibited metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing sister chromatid segregation. Deletion of SAC components by RNAi accelerated the metaphase-anaphase transition during the first cleavage and caused micronuclei formation, chromosome misalignment and aneuploidy, which caused decreased implantation and delayed development. Furthermore, in the presence of the spindle-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, SAC depleted embryos failed to arrest at metaphase. Our results suggest that SAC is essential for the regulation of mitotic cell cycle progression in cleavage stage mouse embryos. © 2011 Wei et al.

However, its role in mammalian meiosis is unclear. In this study, we examined its localization, expression, and functions in mouse oocyte meiosis. Immunofluorescent staining showed that DYNLT3 was restricted to the germinal vesicle and associated with kinetochores at the germinal vesicle breakdown stage, metaphase I and metaphase II. The expression level of DYNLT3 was similar at all meiotic stages. Depletion of DYNLT3 by antibody injection resulted in chromosome misalignment and decrease of the polar body extrusion rate. We further found that DYNLT3-depleted oocytes displayed kinetochore-microtubule detachments. Chromosome-spread experiments showed that depletion of DYNLT3 inhibited the metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing homologous chromosome segregation in meiosis I. Our data suggest that DYNLT3 is required for chromosome alignment and homologous chromosome segregation during mouse oocyte meiosis. © Society for Gynecologic Investigation 2011.

83455262473	Protein profile changes during porcine oocyte aging and effects of caffeine on protein expression patterns	It has been shown that oocyte aging critically affects reproduction and development. By using proteomic tools, in the present study, changes in protein profiles during porcine oocyte aging and effects of caffeine on oocyte aging were investigated. By comparing control MII oocytes with aging MII oocytes, we identified 23 proteins that were up-regulated and 3 proteins that were down-regulated during the aging process. In caffeine-treated oocytes, 6 proteins were identified as up-regulated and 12 proteins were identified as down-regulated. A total of 38 differentially expressed proteins grouped into 5 regulation patterns were determined to relate to the aging and anti-aging process. By using the Gene Ontology system, we found that numerous functional gene products involved in metabolism, stress response, reactive oxygen species and cell cycle regulation were differentially expressed during the oocyte aging process, and most of these proteins are for the first time reported in our study, including 2 novel proteins. In addition, several proteins were found to be modified during oocyte aging. These data contribute new information that may be useful for future research on cellular aging and for improvement of oocyte quality. © 2011 Jiang et al.

84862003767	The G protein coupled receptor 3 is involved in cAMP and cGMP signaling and maintenance of meiotic arrest in porcine oocytes	The arrest of meiotic prophase in mammalian oocytes within fully grown follicles is dependent on cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulation. A large part of cAMP is produced by the Gs-linked G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR) pathway. In the present study, we examined whether GPR3 is involved in the maintenance of meiotic arrest in porcine oocytes. Expression and distribution of GPR3 were examined by western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. The results showed that GPR3 was expressed at various stages during porcine oocyte maturation. At the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, GPR3 displayed a maximal expression level, and its expression remained stable from pro-metaphase I (MI) to metaphase II (MII). Immunofluorescence staining showed that GPR3 was mainly distributed at the nuclear envelope during the GV stage and localized to the plasma membrane at pro-MI, MI and MII stages. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down the GPR3 expression within oocytes. Injection of small interfering double-stranded RNA (siRNA) targeting GPR3 stimulated meiotic resumption of oocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of GPR3 inhibited meiotic maturation of porcine oocytes, which was caused by increase of cGMP and cAMP levels and inhibition of cyclin B accumulation. Furthermore, incubation of porcine oocytes with the GPR3 ligand sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) inhibited oocyte maturation. We propose that GPR3 is required for maintenance of meiotic arrest in porcine oocytes through pathways involved in the regulation of cAMP and cGMP. © 2012 Yang et al.

84863130924	Synaptotagmin1 is required for spindle stability and metaphase-to-anaphase transition in mouse oocytes	Synaptotagmin1, a calcium sensor for exocytosis, forms the 7S complex, or so-called SNARE protein complex, together with SNAP -25, syntaxin and synaptobrevin to mediate docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles to the plasma membrane of the nerve terminal. Here, we identified the unique localization, expression and function of Syt1 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation by using confocal microscopy, western blotting, Morpholino-based knockdown and time-lapse live cell imaging. We showed that Syt1 expression was gradually increased during oocyte maturation. Syt1 was localized at the oocyte cortex from GV to MII stages and at the spindle poles in MI and MII phases, with one third of a signalfree zone at the oocyte cortex, where the chromosomes are located, which is similar to the distribution pattern of CGs from the pro-MI to MII stages. Knockdown of Syt1 resulted in pro-MI/MI arrest and PB1 extrusion decrease, with severely disrupted spindles and misaligned chromosomes. Knockdown of Syt1 also caused abnormal localization of γ-tubulin, which became redistributed into the cytoplasm. Chromosome spreading showed failure of homologous chromosome segregation. The spindle assembly checkpoint protein Bub3 was detected at the kinetochores even after 10 h of oocyte culture. Live cell imaging analysis revealed that knockdown of Syt1 resulted in abnormal spindles with various morphologies and chromosomes arrested at the pro-MI/MI stage. Defective spindles failed to support chromosome alignment along microtubules, which led to repetitive unsuccessful metaphase-anaphase transitions and failure of PB1 extrusion after extended culture. Taken together, we suggest that Syt1 may act as a MTOC-associated protein to play important roles in mouse oocyte spindle organization/stability, and that it is indispensable for the metaphase-anaphase transition to promote mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863265533	Localization and function of the Ska complex during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	The Ska (spindle and kinetochore-associated) complex is composed of three proteins: Ska1, Ska2 and Ska3. It is required for stabilizing kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) interactions and silencing the spindle checkpoint during mitosis. However, its roles in meiosis remain unclear. The present study was designed to investigate the localization and function of the Ska complex during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Our results showed that the localization and function of Ska complex in mouse oocyte meiosis differ in part from those in mitosis. Injection of low-dose exogenous Myc-Ska mRNA showed that, instead of localizing to the kinetochores (KTs) and mediating KT-MT interactions from pro-metaphase to midanaphase stages as in mitosis, the members of the Ska complex were only localized on spindle microtubules from the Pro-MI to MII stages in mouse oocyte meiosis. Time-lapse live imaging analysis showed that knockdown of any member of the Ska complex by Morpholino injection into mouse oocytes resulted in spindle movement defects and enlarged polar bodies. Depletion of the whole Ska complex disrupted the stability of the anaphase spindle and influenced the extrusion of the first polar body. Taken together, these results show that the Ska complex plays an important role in meiotic spindle migration and anaphase spindle stability during mouse oocyte maturation. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84863736558	The roles of parathyroid hormone-like hormone during mouse preimplantation embryonic development	Parathyroid hormone-like hormone (PTHLH) was first identified as a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-like factor responsible for humoral hypercalcemia in malignancies in the 1980s. Previous studies demonstrated that PTHLH is expressed in multiple tissues and is an important regulator of cellular and organ growth, development, migration, differentiation, and survival. However, there is a lack of data on the expression and function of PTHLH during preimplantation embryonic development. In this study, we investigated the expression characteristics and functions of PTHLH during mouse preimplantation embryonic development. The results show that Pthlh is expressed in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos at all developmental stages, with the highest expression at the MII stage of the oocytes and the lowest expression at the blastocyst stage of the preimplantation embryos. The siRNA-mediated depletion of Pthlh at the MII stage oocytes or the 1-cell stage embryos significantly decreased the blastocyst formation rate, while this effect could be corrected by culturing the Pthlh depleted embryos in the medium containing PTHLH protein. Moreover, expression of the pluripotency-related genes Nanog and Pou5f1 was significantly reduced in Pthlh-depleted embryos at the morula stage. Additionally, histone acetylation patterns were altered by Pthlh depletion. These results suggest that PTHLH plays important roles during mouse preimplantation embryonic development. © 2012 Guo et al.

Patients with IR and hyperinsulinemia undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF are at increased risks of impaired oocyte developmental competence, implantation failure and pregnancy loss. However, the precise underlying mechanism remains unknown. Methods We investigated how IR impairs oocyte quality and early embryonic development by an insulin-resistant mouse model. Oocyte quality, fertilization and embryonic development were analyzed. Furthermore, oxidant stress products and mitochondrial function were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence. Results An imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants revealed by increased concentrations of reactive oxygen species, and a decreased concentration of glutathione (GSH) and a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio resulted in oxidative stress (OS) and impaired mitochondrial function in germinal vesicle (GV) and metaphase II (MII) oocytes of insulin-resistant mice. MII oocytes displayed a decrease in the ATP content and the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. In contrast, GV oocytes were characterized by a high ATP content concomitant with increased clustering of mitochondria and a high inner mitochondrial membrane potential. GV oocytes from insulin-resistant mice showed early stage apoptosis, and fewer MII oocytes could be retrieved from these mice and were of poor quality associated with decreased fertilization and an arrest of embryo development with increased fragmentation. Abnormal spindles and misaligned chromosomes of MII oocyte were significantly increased in IR and hyperinsulinemia mice compared with the control mice. Conclusions IR contributes to OS and disrupts mitochondrial function in mouse oocytes. This may impair the accurate transmission of mtDNA from one generation to the next. Therefore, our results suggest that OS and mitochondrial dysfunction are responsible for poor oocyte quality of insulin-resistant mice, and may provide novel targets to improve low fertility in females with IR. © The Author 2012.

84864270548	Whole transcriptome analysis of the effects of type I diabetes on mouse oocytes	In mouse ovarian follicles, granulosa cells but not oocytes take up glucose to provide the oocyte with nourishments for energy metabolism. Diabetes-induced hyperglycemia or glucose absorption inefficiency consistently causes granulosa cell apoptosis and further exerts a series of negative impacts on oocytes including reduced meiosis resumption rate, low oocyte quality and preimplantation embryo degeneration. Here we compared the transcriptome of mouse oocytes from genetically derived NOD diabetic mice or chemically induced STZ diabetic mice with that of corresponding normal mice. Differentially expressed genes were extracted from the two diabetic models. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that genes associated with metabolic and developmental processes were differentially expressed in oocytes from both models of diabetes. In addition, NOD diabetes also affected the expression of genes associated with ovulation, cell cycle progression, and preimplantation embryo development. Notably, Dnmt1 expression was significantly down-regulated, but Mbd3 expression was up-regulated in diabetic mouse oocytes. Our data not only revealed the mechanisms by which diabetes affects oocyte quality and preimplantation embryo development, but also linked epigenetic hereditary factors with metabolic disorders in germ cells. © 2012 Ma et al.

84866266394	Septin 7 is required for orderly meiosis in mouse oocytes	Septin 7 is a conserved GTP-binding protein. In this study, we examined the localization and functions of Septin 7 during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. Immunofluorescent analysis showed that intrinsic Septin 7 localized to the spindles from the pro-MI stage to the MII stage. Knockdown of Septin 7 by siRNA microinjection caused abnormal spindles and affected extrusion of the first polar body. Septin 7 mRNA tagged with myc was injected into GV stage oocytes to overexpress Septin 7. Overexpressed Myc-Septin 7 localized to the spindle and beneath the plasma membrane displaying long filaments. Fluorescence intensity of spindle α-tubulin in myc-Septin 7-injected oocytes was weaker than that of the control group, demonstrating that Septin 7 may influence recruitment of α-tubulin to spindles. MII oocytes injected with myc-Septin 7 exhibited abnormal chromosome alignment, and parthenogenetic activation failed to allow extrusion of the second polar body, suggesting that overexpression of Septin 7 may affect extrusion of the polar body by disturbing the alignment of chromosomes and regulating α-tubulin recruitment to spindles. In summary, Septin 7 may regulate meiotic cell cycle progression by affecting microtubule cytoskeletal dynamics in mouse oocytes. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

0038157209	Isolation and culture of embryonic stem cells from porcine blastocysts	This study was conducted to establish embryonic stem (ES) cell lines from porcine blastocysts. Blastocysts were collected from China miniature pigs at day 7-9 of pregnancy. Embryos were either directly (intact embryos) cultured on mitomysin C-inactivated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as feeder layers, or were used to isolate the inner cell masses (ICM) by enzyme digestive method and then cultured. It was found that enzyme digestive method could isolate ICMs without any damages of cells in all blastocysts (28). AII ICMs attached to the feeder layers. Primary cell colonies were formed in 68% of ICM culture and 28% of intact blastocyst culture. Two ES cell lines derived from ICM passed six subcultures (passages). These cells morphologically resembled mouse ES cells and consistently expressed alkaline phosphatase activity. When the ES cells were cultured in a medium without feeder layer and leukemin inhibitory factor, they differentiated into several types of cells including neuron-like, smooth muscle-like, and epithelium-like cells. Some cells formed embryoid bodies in a suspension culture. These results indicate that porcine ES cell line can be established under the present experimental conditions and these ES cells are pluripotent. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

84872381344	Specific Disruption of Tsc1 in Ovarian Granulosa Cells Promotes Ovulation and Causes Progressive Accumulation of Corpora Lutea	Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (Tsc1) is a tumor suppressor negatively regulating mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). It is reported that mice lacking Tsc1 gene in oocytes show depletion of primordial follicles, resulting in premature ovarian failure and subsequent infertility. A recent study indicated that deletion of Tsc1 in somatic cells of the reproductive tract caused infertility of female mice. However, it is not known whether specific disruption of Tsc1 in granulosa cells influences the reproductive activity of female mice. To clarify this problem, we mated Tsc1

84873354622	The distribution and possible role of erk8 in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryo cleavage	Abstract It is well known that extracellular signal-regulated kinase 8 (ERK8) plays pivotal roles in various mitotic events. But its physiological roles in oocyte meiotic maturation remain unclear. In this study, we found that although no specific ERK8 signal was detected in oocyte at the germinal vesicle stage, ERK8 began to migrate to the periphery of chromosomes shortly after germinal vesicle breakdown. At prometaphase I, metaphase I (MI), anaphase I, telophase I, and metaphase II (MII) stages, ERK8 was stably detected at the spindles. By taxol treatment, we clarified that the ERK8 signal was stained on the spindle fibers as well as microtubule asters in MI and MII oocytes. In fertilized eggs, the ERK8 signal was not observed in the two pronuclei stages. At prometaphase, metaphase, and anaphase of the first mitosis, ERK8 was detected on the mitotic spindle. ERK8 knock down by antibody microinjection and specific siRNA caused abnormal spindles, failed chromosome congression, and decreased first polar body extrusion. Taken together, our results suggest that ERK8 plays an important role in spindle organization during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation and early embryo cleavage.

84874866253	Knockdown of UCHL5IP causes abnormalities in γ-tubulin localisation, spindle organisation and chromosome alignment in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	UCHL5IP is one of the subunits of the haus complex, which is important for microtubule generation, spindle bipolarity and accurate chromosome segregation in Drosophila and human mitotic cells. In this study, the expression and localisation of UCHL5IP were explored, as well as its functions in mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. The results showed that the UCHL5IP protein level was consistent during oocyte maturation and it was localised to the meiotic spindle in MI and MII stages. Knockdown of UCHL5IP led to spindle defects, chromosome misalignment and disruption of γ-tubulin localisation in the spindle poles. These results suggest that UCHL5IP plays critical roles in spindle formation during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation. © CSIRO 2013.

84876273072	The effects of dna double-strand breaks on mouse oocyte meiotic maturation	Both endogenous and exogenous factors can induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in oocytes, which is a potential risk for human-assisted reproductive technology as well as animal nuclear transfer. Here we used bleomycin (BLM) and laser micro-beam dissection (LMD) to induce DNA DSBs in germinal vesicle (GV) stage oocytes and compared the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) rates and first polar body extrusion (PBE) rates between DNA DSB oocytes and untreated oocytes. Employing live cell imaging and immunofluorescence labeling, we observed the dynamics of DNA fragments during oocyte maturation. We also determined the cyclin B1 expression pattern in oocytes to analyze spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) activity in DNA DSB oocytes. We used parthenogenetic activation to determine if the DNA DSB oocytes could be activated. As a result, we found that the BLM- or LMD-induced DSB oocytes showed lower GVBD rates and took a longer time to undergo GVBD compared with untreated oocytes. PBE was also delayed in DSB oocytes, but once GVBD had occurred, PBE was not affected, even in oocytes with severe DSBs. Compared with control oocytes, the DSB oocytes showed higher SAC activity, as indicated by less Ccnb1-GFP degradation during metaphase I to anaphase I transition. Parthenogenetic activation could activate the metaphase to interphase transition in the DNA DSB mature oocytes, but many oocytes contained multiple pronuclei or numerous micronuclei. These data suggest that DNA damage inhibits or delays the G2/M transition, but once GVBD occurs, DNA-damaged oocytes can complete chromosome separation and polar body extrusion even under a higher SAC activity, causing the formation of numerous micronuclei in early embryos. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84876293496	Maternal diabetes causes abnormal dynamic changes of endoplasmic reticulum during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development	Background: The adverse effects of maternal diabetes on oocyte maturation and embryo development have been reported.Methods: In this study, we used time-lapse live cell imaging confocal microscopy to investigate the dynamic changes of ER and the effects of diabetes on the ER's structural dynamics during oocyte maturation, fertilization and early embryo development.Results: We report that the ER first became remodeled into a dense ring around the developing MI spindle, and then surrounded the spindle during migration to the cortex. ER reorganization during mouse early embryo development was characterized by striking localization around the pronuclei in the equatorial section, in addition to larger areas of fluorescence deeper within the cytoplasm. In contrast, in diabetic mice, the ER displayed a significantly higher percentage of homogeneous distribution patterns throughout the entire ooplasm during oocyte maturation and early embryo development. In addition, a higher frequency of large ER aggregations was detected in GV oocytes and two cell embryos from diabetic mice.Conclusions: These results suggest that the diabetic condition adversely affects the ER distribution pattern during mouse oocyte maturation and early embryo development. © 2013 Zhang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84879388453	Maternal factors required for oocyte developmental competence in mice	During mouse antral follicle development, the oocyte chromatin gradually transforms from a less condensed state with no Hoechst-positive rim surrounding the nucleolus (NSN) to a fully condensed chromatin state with a Hoechst-positive rim surrounding the nucleolus (SN). Compared with SN oocytes, NSN oocytes display a higher gene transcription activity and a lower rate of meiosis resumption (G2/M transition), and they are mostly arrested at the two-cell stage after in vitro fertilization. To explore the differences between NSN and SN oocytes, and the maternal factors required for oocyte developmental competence, we compared the whole-transcriptome profiles between NSN and SN oocytes. First, we found that the NSN and SN oocytes were different in their metabolic pathways. In the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, the SN oocytes tend to produce diacylglycerol, whereas the NSN oocytes tend to produce phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate. For energy production, the SN oocytes and NSN oocytes differed in the gluconeogenesis and in the synthesis processes. Second, we also found that the key genes associated with oocyte meiosis and/or preimplantation embryo development were differently expressed in the NSN and SN oocytes. Our results illustrate that during the NSN-SN transition, the oocytes change their metabolic activities and accumulate maternal factors for further oocyte maturation and post-fertilization embryo development. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.

84881410399	Unique insights into maternal mitochondrial inheritance in mice	In animals, mtDNA is always transmitted through the female and this is termed "maternal inheritance." Recently, autophagy was reported to be involved in maternal inheritance by elimination of paternal mitochondria and mtDNA in Caenorhabditis elegans; moreover, by immunofluorescence, P62 and LC3 proteins were also found to colocalize to sperm mitochondria after fertilization in mice. Thus, it has been speculated that autophagy may be an evolutionary conserved mechanism for paternal mitochondrial elimination. However, by using two transgenic mouse strains, one bearing GFP-labeled autophagosomes and the other bearing red fluorescent protein-labeled mitochondria, we demonstrated that autophagy did not participate in the postfertilization elimination of sperm mitochondria in mice. Although P62 and LC3 proteins congregated to sperm mitochondria immediately after fertilization, sperm mitochondria were not engulfed and ultimately degraded in lysosomes until P62 and LC3 proteins disengaged from sperm mitochondria. Instead, sperm mitochondria unevenly distributed in blastomeres during cleavage and persisted in several cells until the morula stages. Furthermore, by using single sperm mtDNA PCR, we observed that most motile sperm that had reached the oviduct for fertilization had eliminated their mtDNA, leaving only vacuolar mitochondria. However, if sperm with remaining mtDNA entered the zygote, mtDNA was not eliminated and could be detected in newborn mice. Based on these results, we conclude that, in mice, maternal inheritance of mtDNA is not an active process of sperm mitochondrial and mtDNA elimination achieved through autophagy in early embryos, but may be a passive process as a result of prefertilization sperm mtDNA elimination and uneven mitochondrial distribution in embryos.

84880982630	Cyclin O Regulates Germinal Vesicle Breakdown in Mouse Oocytes	It is well accepted that oocyte meiotic resumption is mainly regulated by the maturation-promoting factor (MPF), which is composed of cyclin B1 (CCNB1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDC2). Maturation-promoting factor activity is regulated by the expression level of CCNB1, phosphorylation of CDC2, and their germinal vesicle (GV) localization. In addition to CCNB1, cyclin O (CCNO) is highly expressed in oocytes, but its biological functions are still not clear. By employing short interfering RNA microinjection of GV-stage oocytes, we found that Ccno knockdown inhibited CDC2 (Tyr15) dephosphorylation and arrested oocytes at the GV stage. To rescue meiotic resumption, cell division cycle 25 B kinase (Cdc25b) and Ccnb1 were overexpressed in the Ccno knockdown oocytes. Unexpectedly, we found that Ccno knockdown did not affect CDC25B entry into the GV, and overexpression of CDC25B was not able to rescue resumption of oocyte meiosis. However, GV breakdown (GVBD) was significantly increased after overexpression of Ccnb1 in Ccno knockdown oocytes, indicating that GVBD block caused by cyclin O knockdown can be rescued by cyclin B1 overexpression. We thus conclude that cyclin O, as an upstream regulator of MPF, plays an important role in oocyte meiotic resumption in mouse oocytes. © 2013 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.

The functional roles of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in meiotic maturation and activation of pig oocytes were studied by drug treatment, Western blot analysis, kinase activity assay, indirect immunostaining, and confocal microscopy. The results indicated that meiotic resumption of both cumulus-enclosed and denuded oocytes was prevented by CaMKII inhibitor KN-93, Ant-AIP-II, or CaM antagonist W7 in a dose-dependent manner, but only germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) of denuded oocytes was inhibited by membrane permeable Ca

This study was designed to examine whether embryo cryopreservation straws can be used to conduct IVF in porcine oocytes. The efficiency of this system was further compared with traditional microdrop IVF. Immature oocytes were aspirated from antral follicles and matured in vitro. After maturation, oocytes were inseminated either in straws or in microdrops with frozen-thawed boar spermatozoa. For straw IVF, sperm concentration and the presence of air columns between insemination segment and oil column were examined. Sperm-oocyte binding and cortical granules (CGs) before and after sperm penetration were examined by confocal microscopy. When various sperm concentrations were used for IVF in the straws with air columns, it was found that 5 × 10

84893421581	DNA methylation in oocytes and liver of female mice and their offspring: Effects of high-fat-diet-induced obesity	Background: Maternal obesity has adverse effects on oocyte quality, embryo development, and the health of the offspring. Objectives: To understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of maternal obesity, we investigated the DNA methylation status of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes. Methods: Using a high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse model of obesity, we analyzed the DNA methylation of several imprinted genes and metabolism-related genes in oocytes from control and obese dams and in oocytes and liver from their offspring. Analysis was performed using combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing. Results: DNA methylation of imprinted genes in oocytes was not altered in either obese dams or their offspring; however, DNA methylation of metabolism-related genes was changed. In oocytes of obese mice, the DNA methylation level of the leptin (Lep) promoter was significantly increased and that of the Ppar-α promoter was reduced. Increased methylation of Lep and decreased methylation of Ppar-α was also observed in the liver of female offspring from dams fed the high-fat diet (OHFD). mRNA expression of Lep and Ppar-α was also significantly altered in the liver of these OHFD. In OHFD oocytes, the DNA methylation level of Ppar-α promoter was increased. Conclusions: Our results indicate that DNA methylation patterns of several metabolismrelated genes are changed not only in oocytes of obese mice but also in oocytes and liver of their offspring. These data may contribute to the understanding of adverse effects of maternal obesity on reproduction and health of the offspring.

84893470415	Paternally induced transgenerational inheritance of susceptibility to diabetes in mammals	The global prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasing, and it is contributing to the susceptibility to diabetes and its related epidemic in offspring. Although the impacts of paternal impaired fasting blood glucose and glucose intolerance on the metabolism of offspring have been well established, the exact molecular and mechanistic basis that mediates these impacts remains largely unclear. Here we show that paternal prediabetes increases the susceptibility to diabetes in offspring through gametic epigenetic alterations. In our findings, paternal prediabetes led to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in offspring. Relative to controls, offspring of prediabetic fathers exhibited altered gene expression patterns in the pancreatic islets, with down-regulation of several genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathways. Epigenomic profiling of offspring pancreatic islets revealed numerous changes in cytosine methylation depending on paternal prediabetes, including reproducible changes in methylation over several insulin signaling genes. Paternal prediabetes altered overall methylome patterns in sperm, with a large portion of differentially methylated genes overlapping with that of pancreatic islets in offspring. Our study uniquely revealed that prediabetes can be inherited transgenerationally through the mammalian germ line by an epigenetic mechanism.

84899486726	Maternal obesity and diabetes may cause DNA methylation alteration in the spermatozoa of offspring in mice	Background: The adverse effects on offspring of diabetic and/or obese mothers can be passed to the next generation. However, the mechanisms behind this are still unclear. Epigenetics may play a key role during this process.Methods: To confirm the hypothesis, we investigated the DNA methylation of several imprinted genes in spermatozoa of offspring from diabetic and/or obese mothers utilizing streptozotocin (STZ)- and high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced mouse models.Results: We found that the DNA methylation of Peg3 was significantly increased in spermatozoa of offspring of obese mothers compared to that in spermatozoa of offspring of normal mothers. The DNA methylation of H19 was significantly higher in spermatozoa of offspring of diabetic mothers than that in spermatozoa of offspring of non-diabetic mothers.Conclusions: These results indicate that pre-gestational diabetes and/or obesity can alter DNA methylation in offspring spermatozoa. © 2014 Ge et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

0347093432	Localization of centromere proteins and their association with chromosomes and microtubules during meiotic maturation in pig oocytes	Centromere proteins (CENPs) are required for the attachment of microtubules to chromosomes. However, their structure and mechanism of action are not well understood, especially in mammalian meiosis. The present study was conducted to examine (i) whether a human nuclear centromere autoantibody can be used to localize the CENPs in pig oocytes and (ii) the dynamics of CENPs and their association with microtubules and chromosomes during meiosis in pigs. Oocytes at various stages were double-labelled for CENPs, chromosomes or microtubules and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Quantification of tubulin and CENPs in the oocytes was determined by immunoblotting. CENPs were detected in all oocytes from germinal vesicle (GV) to metaphase II (MII) stages. The changes in the location were associated with chromosome movement and spindle formation. Tubulin was detected in the oocytes from GV to MII stages and no differences in content were observed. Two major CENPs at 80 kDa (CENP-B) and 50 kDa (CENP-D) were also found in the oocytes by the autoantibody and its content was significantly lower in the oocytes at GV stage compared with oocytes at other stages. These results indicate that the autoantibody used in this study can be used to detect CENPs in the kinetochores, and the proteins are expressed in pig oocytes at all stages during meiosis. As the localization of CENPs is associated with spindle formation and chromosome movement, CENPs may participate in cell cycle changes during meiosis in mammals.

10944241451	Localization of mitotic arrest deficient 1 (MAD1) in mouse oocytes during the first meiosis and its functions as a spindle checkpoint protein	The present study was designed to investigate the localization of mitotic arrest deficient 1 (MAD1) in mouse oocytes during meiotic maturation and its relationship with kinetochores, chromosomes, and microtubules. Oocytes at various stages during the first meiosis were fixed and immunostained for MAD1, kinetochores, microtubules, and chromosomes. The stained oocytes were examined by confocal microscopy. Some oocytes were treated with nocodazole or Taxol before examination. The anti-MAD1 antibody was injected into the oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage for examination of chromosome alignment and spindle formation. It was found that MAD1 was present in the oocytes from the GV to prometaphase I stages around the nuclei. When the oocytes reached the metaphase I (M-I) to metaphase II (M-II) stages, MAD1 was mainly localized at the spindle poles. However, MAD1 relocated to the vicinity of the chromosomes when spindles were disassembled by nocodazole or cooling, and the relocated MAD1 moved back to the spindle poles during spindle recovery. Taxol treatment did not affect the MAD1 localization. Although anti-MAD1 antibody injection did not affect nuclear maturation, significantly higher proportions of injected oocytes had misaligned chromosomes when the oocytes reached the M-I to M-II stages. The results of the present study indicate that MAD1 is present in mouse oocytes at all stages during the first meiosis and that it participates in spindle checkpoint during meiosis. However, MAD1 could not check misaligned chromosomes during spindle recovery after the spindles were destroyed by drug or cooling, which caused some chromosomes to scatter in the oocytes.

12344298312	Reduced expression of MAD2, BCL2, and MAP kinase activity in pig oocytes after in vitro aging are associated with defects in sister chromatid segregation during meiosis II and embryo fragmentation after activation	This study was conducted to examine expression of centromere protein B (CENPB), spindle checkpoint protein MAD2 (mitotic arrest deficient protein), and antiapoptotic protein BCL2; activities of MARK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and mitochondria distribution in pig oocytes during aging, and their relationship with sister chromatid separation during meiosis II and embryo fragmentation and apoptosis after activation. After immature oocytes were cultured for 40-72 h, CENPB, MAD2, tubulin, BCL2, and MAPK in the oocytes were examined by immunoblotting. Spindles, chromosomes, kinetochores, and mitochondria were examined by immunofluorescence staining and apoptosis was examined by TUNEL assay. It was found that tubulin and CENPB was not changed during 40-72 h of culture. However, the expression of MAD2 and BCL2 and the activity of MAPK were gradually reduced during oocyte aging. The percentages of oocytes with normal spindle, chromosomes, and kinetochores were also reduced as oocyte aged from 9.5% at 40 h to 17.3%, 34.6%, and 42.9% at 48, 60, and 72 h, respectively. Aggregated mitochondria were found in the aged oocytes as compared with the uniform distribution in young oocytes. After activation, the proportions of oocytes with abnormal anaphase II were significantly increased in aged oocytes. More (P < 0.001) oocytes cultured for 60-72 h fragmented and showed apoptosis after activation as compared with the oocytes cultured for 40-48 h. This study indicates that aging reduces expression in spindle checkpoint protein and antiapoptosis protein and MAPK activity in pig oocytes. These events in turn cause abnormal sister chromatid segregation during meiosis II, embryo fragmentation, and apoptosis.
