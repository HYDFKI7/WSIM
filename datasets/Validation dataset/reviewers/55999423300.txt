1442300761	Prevalence of Parkinson's disease in a Chinese population	Background - Ethnic differences in the prevalence of Parkinson's disease have been observed, but may be due to differences in screening instruments and diagnostic criteria. Aims - To compare the prevalence of Parkinson's disease in Hong Kong Chinese and Australians in Sydney. Methods - A door-to-door community survey in the Hong Kong Chinese population was carried out using a two-staged procedure (screening questionnaire followed by physical examination), which had been validated for use in the community in a survey among Australians, to determine the prevalence in Chinese and to compare with that in Australians. Results - A total of 1080 households were contacted, the non-response rate was 27%. The prevalence among those aged 55 years in the community and above was 0.5%, and 0.186% for the overall population assuming no subjects were below 55 years. These figures are lower than the 3.6% for Australians, aged >55 years. Conclusion - There appears to be a difference in prevalence of Parkinson's disease between Hong Kong Chinese and Australians in Sydney. Such differences may be due to documented differences in prevalence of genetic polymorphisms associated with Parkinson's disease between Chinese and Australians, or to differences in environmental factors.

16644376122	Associations between food variety and body fatness in Hong Kong Chinese adults	Background: Food variety is reported to be closely associated with body fatness in Caucasians. The association has not been examined in a Chinese population. Objective: To examine the association between food variety and body fatness in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Design: One hundred and twenty Hong Kong Chinese adults (aged 18-50 y). Usual dietary intake over a one-week period of all subjects was assessed by using a food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric parameters were measured using standardized methods. Results: Varieties of grain and meat were negatively correlated with obesity indices (grain vs. BMI/body fat/waist/hip circumferences: partial r = -47/-0.43/-0.46/-0.42, p < 0.001; meat vs. BMI/body fat/waist/hip circumferences: partial r = -0.31/-0.24/-0.25/-0.29, p < 0.01). In contrast, there was a positive relationship between variety of snack and obesity indices (snack vs. BMI/body fat/waist/hip circumferences: partial r = 0.35/0.42/0.42/0.36, p < 0.001). A food variety ratio derived from varieties of snack, grain and meat, was a stronger predictor of body fat compared with dietary fat in a regression model. Conclusion: Food variety may contribute to the local escalation in the prevalence of obesity. The variety of snack is the promoting factor for obesity while the variety of grains and meats may counteract its development. The findings of this study may have implications for treatment of obesity and the prevention of further weight gain.

Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: In total, 14 residential care facilities in Hong Kong, stratified by nature (government subvention or for-profit) to reflect the overall proportion in Hong Kong. Subjects: A total of 1914 subjects were assessed, using the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) 2.0. The response rate was 95% (1820 subjects), of which 1699 subjects had complete nutritional information. Intervention: Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by weighing and height measurement, and arm span was used if the subject could not stand. Subjects who were receiving parenteral or enteral nutrition via nasogastric of enterostomy tubes were excluded. A history of weight loss of 5% in the past month or 10% in the past 6 months, leaving 25% of food uneaten, and BMI < 18.5 kg/m

20444468195	A community model for care of elderly people with diabetes via telemedicine	A primary care group diabetes care program using telemedicine was developed and its feasibility and acceptability were tested in 22 subjects with Type 2 diabetes mellitus using a one-group, pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. Compliance with the program was 100%. Significant reductions in total calorie intake as well as body mass index were achieved, with an increase in the percentage of subjects achieving better diabetes control as measured by the 2-hr hemastix. Improvements in diabetes knowledge and disease-specific and generic measures of quality of life were also observed. Most subjects evaluated this mode of service delivery favorably in the questionnaire and focus group discussions. There is potential for the integration of this mode of service delivery into current health services. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0030699306	Plasma total antioxidant capacity in an adult Hong Kong Chinese population	Objectives: To examine plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) in a Chinese population with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease compared with Caucasian populations, in relation to dietary intake, age, sex, and the presence of cardiovascular diseases. Design and methods: As part of a randomized territory-wide survey stratified by sex and 10-year age groups; 728 subjects (367 men, 361 women) were recruited. Dietary intake assessment was by a food frequency questionnaire; plasma TAOC was estimated by the ABTS method. Results: The TAOC values were normally distributed, the mean ± SD being 1.78 ± 0.18 mmol/L. The mean value was higher in men compared with women, inspite of a lower dietary intake of vitamins A and C per 1000 kcal in the former. Subjects who consumed water spinach twice or more a week had higher mean levels. No difference in mean revels was observed between those with and without hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: Measurement of plasma TAOC as a risk factor in epidemiological studies of cardiovascular diseases may have limited use, since TAOC include substances associated with a protective effect as well as increased risk.

0031838577	Aetiology of allergic rhinitis in Hong Kong	In a 1993 survey, allergic rhinitis was identified as the most common allergic disease in Hong Kong, affecting 29.1% of schoolchildren. Recently (1995), the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) also reported 44.5% current rhinitis among Hong Kong teenagers. Our objective was to study the aetiology of allergic rhinitis in Hong Kong using serological tests of allergen sensitization. In 57 allergic rhinitis patients and in the same number of age- and sex-matched controls the following were measured: serum total IgE, mixed aeroallergen IgE (Phadiatop(TM)) and specific IgE versus house dust mite (HDM), cockroach, cat and dog dander, mould mixture (Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Alternaria species) and four local pollens (Bermuda grass, Timothy, ragweed and mugwort). Compared with controls, allergic rhinitis patients (26 males, 31 females; mean (± SD) age 25 ± 11 years) had a significantly elevated serum total IgE concentration (mean ± SEM: 496 ± 88 vs 179 ± 38 kU/L) and an increased proportion of positive Phadiatop (95 vs 33%) and specific IgE tests versus HDM (90 vs 44%) and cockroach (42 vs 9%; Mann-Whitney U-test and X

0031879411	Pain in Chinese cancer patients under palliative care	Over a 4-month period, 218 Chinese patients with advanced cancer were admitted to a palliative care unit in Hong Kong. Ninety-five (44%) of them had pain. Of these 95, 70 (mean age 61.7 years) were evaluated with the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale (NRS). Forty-two per cent of the 70 patients were illiterate. Eighty-three per cent had metastases. Eighty-seven per cent had pain due to the disease process. Forty-nine per cent had more than one pain, 54% had moderate pain and 20% had severe pain. The most common primary tumour was lung cancer. NRS scores strongly correlated with corresponding VAS scores, suggesting that NRS can routinely be used for pain intensity assessment in the Chinese. The study also showed that 64% of these patients with pain had moderate to severe disabilities in the basic activity of daily living, although there was no correlation between the severity of pain and the severity of disability.

0031982268	How common is acute otitis media in Hong Kong	Objective: To study the attendance rate and clinical presentation of acute otitis media (AOM) at several clinics of different settings in Hong Kong in order to gain some insight into the epidemiology of AOM in Hong Kong children. Design: A prospective, collaborative, cross-sectional study. Subjects: Children with AOM seen at a private paediatric practice, a walk-in paediatric clinic at a private hospital and an Accident and Emergency Department of a large public hospital between April 1996 and March 1997 were included in study. Outcome measure: Prevalence in AOM. Results: The contributions of AOM to the total number of consultations of paediatric patients varied between 0.6% to 6.3%. Conclusion: Compared to Western developed countries. AOM is much less common in Hong Kong Chinese children.

24144503330	Frailty index as a measure of biological age in a Chinese population	Background. The concept of a frailty index, developed in Canadian elderly populations as an indicator of biological age as opposed to chronological age, was tested in an elderly Chinese population to determine whether it is applicable in a different ethnic and cultural setting. Methods. A data set including 62 physical, psychological, and socioeconomic variables from a cohort of 2032 persons 70 years and older (999 men, 1033 women) was used. The distribution of the index was evaluated using the Cramer-von Mises goodness-of-fit test, and multiple linear regression was used to assess its relationship with age and sex. A biological age for each participant was calculated based on an inverse regression of age on mean frailty index and sex. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the ability of biological age to predict death. Results. The distribution of the frailty index most closely resembled a Weibull distribution. The frailty index increased with age until the mid-80s, when it leveled off, and was higher in women than men for each age group. The distribution of biological age is wider than that for chronological age, and it strongly predicted death. Women had an estimated 20% lesser chance of dying at a given time than did men of the same chronological age and degree of frailty. Conclusions. The study confirms the robustness of the concept and method of calculating the frailty index developed in elderly Canadian populations. It also suggests that the sex difference in life expectancy may have an underlying genetic basis independent of frailty. Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America.

24344435183	Development of the Chinese nutrition screen (CNS) for use in institutional settings	Objectives: To develop and validate a nutritional screening tool (CNS) for elderly Chinese subjects in the institutional setting. Design: Using the MNA as a guide, a questionnaire was developed appropriate for the Chinese health care system, diet, food customs and culture, using physician assessment for comparison. Participants: 200 men and 200 women aged 65 years or older, approximately equally distributed by age between two cities in China (Hong Kong and Shanghai), were recruited from hospitals and old age homes for the reliability study. 340 men and 527 women were recruited for the validity study. Results: The CNS compared with phyician assessments based on two groups, normal or at risk with less than normal nutritional status, had kappa coefficients of 0.5 overall and were as high as 0.8 in Shanghai. CNS was able to identify about 90% of all persons with normal nutritional status and had about a 60% chance of correctly identifying a person at risk with a less than normal nutritional status. Conclusion: The CNS can be used in a 2-group classification to identify those who have a normal nutritional status (CNS ≥ 21). Those who do not fall into this group should have their nutritional status evaluated in greater detail (CNS score ≤ 20). The applicability of screening tools may vary depending on the site and the population characteristics. © The Journal of Nutrition, Health & Aging 2005.

27244448459	Unusual cases of human myiasis due to Old World screwworm fly acquired indoors in Hong Kong	Myiasis is the infestation of tissue by the larvae of flies. We report eight cases of human myiasis in Hong Kong. All patients were nursing home residents with an average age of 81.8 years. Seven patients were bedridden with advanced dementia. Four patients had pre-existing wounds. Five had poor oral hygiene and four of those were on tube feeding. All of the five patients with poor oral hygiene suffered from oral myiasis. Two patients had vaginal infestations and one had wound myiasis in his diabetic foot ulcer. Seven cases were infested by Chrysomya bezziana, an obligatory parasite that requires living mammalian tissue for its larval development. Larvae of the Calliphoridae family were responsible for the remaining case. Patients were managed with manual removal of larvae and irrigation of the site of infestation with saline. All infestations were nosocomial, being acquired in nursing homes. Carers of the old and debilitated should be made aware of the need for better oral care, especially for those on tube feeding. The use of window screens in nursing homes should be encouraged to reduce the chance of flies entering the vicinity of these patients. Electrocuters could also be mounted indoors to kill flies that do enter. © 2005 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

27944473040	Social determinants of frailty	Background: Frailty represents a body-wide set of a linked deterioration that occurs with ageing, but is susceptible to active intervention and is reversible. The concept of frailty should include broader environmental factors. A quantitative measure of frailty, the frailty index (FI), developed for elderly Canadians and shown to be valid for an elderly Chinese population, was examined for its association with socioeconomic, lifestyle, and social support network factors in an elderly Chinese cohort. Objective: 2,032 people aged 70 years and over recruited by stratified random sampling of the population were surveyed in 1990-1991, and information obtained regarding physical and functional health, psychological factors, lifestyle, socioeconomic and social support factors. The FI was constructed from 62 variables covering cognitive, psychological and physical health, and tested for association with socioeconomic, lifestyle and social support factors using ANOVA and t test. Results: The mean FI for women was higher than for men (0.16 ± 0.08, n = 1,033 vs. 0.13 ± 0.08, n = 999, p < 0.001, t test). For men, increasing frailty was observed with non-white collar occupations, inadequate expenses, no or little exercise, abstinence from alcohol, few relatives or neighbours and no or infrequent participation in helping others. For women, little contact with relatives (rather than number of relatives), and absence of participation in community/religious activities were additional factors. Conclusion: FI is influenced by social and environmental factors in keeping with the concept of frailty being multi-dimensional. Such a quantitative measure may be a useful indicator of the health of elderly populations as well as for public health measures to combat frailty. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG.

28444459985	Depression is the predominant factor contributing to morale as measured by the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale in elderly Chinese aged 70 years and over	Objective: To examine factors contributing to the total Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale (PGMS) and its two subscales: reconciled ageing and unstrained affect. Method: The PGMS was administered to 759 community-living subjects aged 70 years and over. Information regarding socioeconomic status, health conditions, sensory impairment, physical symptoms, social support, activities of daily living as measured by the Barthel Index, life satisfaction, and the Geriatric Depression Score, was collected. Associations between these factors and PGMS and its subscale were examined using univariate analysis (Mann-Whitney; Kruskal-Wallis tests), and multivariate analysis using the classification and regression tree (CART) method. Results: Gender, old age, physical, socioeconomic and social factors were significantly associated with PGMS. There was a strong correlation with GDS (r = 0.77, p < 0.001). In the CART analysis, for both subscales and the total score, GDS was the predominant factor contributing to the score. Other factors include self perception of health, enough expenses, overall satisfaction with life, gender, and constipation. Discussion: The PGMS and GDS are closely related. In addition to the GDS, health perception, life satisfaction, and adequate finance were factors contributing to quality of life in elderly Hong Kong Chinese. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

30344435258	Factor structure of the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale	Depression is common in patients following stroke and has been found to be related to the degree of functional disability, recovery and engagement in rehabilitation. Consequently, screening for depression is crucial in this group in order to facilitate the delivery of appropriate psychological support. The current study sought to determine key psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in this group. Three versions of the GDS were evaluated, these being the 30-item original measure (GDS-30), the short-form version comprising 15 items (GDS-SF) and a recently developed innovative four-item version (GDS-4). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed the GDS-30 and GDS-SF to offer an acceptable fit to data suggesting utility of these measures for screening. However, the GDS-4 offered a poor fit to the data, suggesting this measure was an inadequate measure of depression in this clinical group. Further, though GDS-30 and GDS-SF measures revealed good internal consistency, the performance of the GDS-4 was marginal. However, all GDS-derived measures demonstrated excellent convergent and divergent validity. It is concluded that the GDS-30 is a useful and appropriate screening instrument in this group. Further, the GDS-SF shows promise in terms of development as a multidimensional measure of depression that may have predictive and outcome monitoring potential. The psychometric shortcomings of the GDS-4 strongly suggest that this measure is unsuitable for screening in this clinical group. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

3042560127	Effect of age and disease on taste perception	Abnormalities in taste function may contribute to poor dietary intake in the elderly, and in patients with renal failure or cancer. This study examined the effect of age on taste thresholds, and taste thresholds adjusted for age, in patients with renal failure with and without dialysis, and patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Three groups of healthy volunteers aged 21-34 (n=26), 36-61 (n=13), and 69-94 (n=24), were recruited for the study on the effect of age. Nineteen patients with chronic renal failure on chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 11 age-matched chronic renal failure patients not yet requiring dialysis were recruited to examine the effect of chronic renal failure on taste function. Twenty-four inpatients with various types of cancer were recruited from a clinical oncology ward. Taste threshold was measured using commercial flavors supplied by Firmenich (pork, beef) and the ascending forced-choice method. Results showed that taste threshold increased with age. No abnormality in taste threshold was observed in patients with chronic renal failure with and without dialysis, and in patients with cancer. However, altered taste occurred in a large number of these patients. Abnormal taste function is present in healthy elderly people, and in patients with chronic renal failure and cancer. The nature of the abnormality differs among these groups, consisting of elevation of taste threshold in the elderly, and dysgeusia in those with disease. © 2004 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

3042651846	Examination of the Philadelphia geriatric morale scale as a subjective quality-of-life measure in elderly Hong Kong Chinese	Purpose: We examine the psychometric properties of the Philadelphia Geriatric Morale Scale (PGMS) in an elderly Chinese population in Hong Kong. Design and Methods: The study consisted of two cohorts: (a) 759 participants aged 70 years and older living in the community who were recruited as part of a territory-wide health survey and interviewed in 1993-1994; and (b) 388 participants living in long-term-care institutions in 1995-1996. Participants who were cognitively impaired (Abbreviated Mental Test score less than 7) or who could not answer questions for other reasons were excluded. The 15-item PGMS was administered. The Rasch dichotomous model was used to assess the validity of the PGMS, and the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, previously validated in Chinese, was also administered to examine the concurrent validity. Results: A confirmatory factor analysis identified three underlying factors similar to findings among Caucasians; however, not all the goodness-of-fit indices were acceptable. An exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring and promax rotation revealed two underlying factors that explained 35% of the total variance: reconciled aging and unstrained affect. Some items were redundant when applied to the institutional sample. Concurrent validity was demonstrated by the good correlation between the reconciled aging and unstrained affect domains and the Geriatric Depression Scale (r = -0.72 and r = -0.56 respectively). Female gender, older age, and residence in institutions were associated with lower morale. Implications: The PGMS is a valid quality-of-life measure in elderly Hong Kong Chinese persons, but its psychometric properties are slightly different from those for Caucasians.

3242881490	A pilot study of phytoestrogen content of soy foods and traditional Chinese medicines for women's health in Hong Kong	In view of the possible health benefits of phytoestrogens, a pilot study was carried out to quantitate the phytoestrogen content of soy foods and tea commonly consumed in Hong Kong, and also of traditional Chinese medicinal (TCM) products that are prescribed for menopausal symptoms and diseases relating to the menopause. Assays of daidzein and genistein were carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography, after extraction procedures. The TCM products were found to contain phytoestrogen in quantities comparable with soy products. Moreover, certain types of Chinese tea contained large quantities of phytoestrogens in the leaves, but also yielded comparable quantities in the infusion for drinking. The phytoestrogen content of these TCM may provide a scientific basis for their actions. However, clinical efficacy can only be determined by clinical trials. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

33644807887	Public health significance of the frailty index	Background: A quantifiable indicator of frailty would be very useful in assessing the health state of older populations, as well as enable the effect of interventions to be evaluated over time. Methods: A total of 2032 people aged 70 years and over recruited by stratified random sampling, and information obtained regarding physical and functional health, and psychological factors. The frailty index (FI) was constructed from 62 variables. Associations between the FI, and changes in ADL score, mental score, and hospitalization days over a 10-year period were evaluated. Results: For the baseline to 3-year changes, a 0.10 increase in baseline FI is accompanied by a 0.499-point faster drop in ADL score, a 0.223-point faster decline in mental score, and 4.57-day faster increase in hospital days. For 3 - 10-year changes, frailty was a significant predictor only of changes in mental score, with results indicating that, on average, each increase of 0.10 in the baseline frailty index was associated with 0.613-point drop in mental score during this period. Chronological age and frailty had differential associations with those changes. Conclusion: The FI is a valid indicator of morbidity and requirement for health and social services for ageing populations. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

A questionnaire containing information regarding socioeconomic status, medical history and lifestyle factors was administered. Measurement included height, weight, percentage body fat using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and ABI. The Hong Kong population (2000) age adjusted prevalence of ABI <0.9 was 5.3% for men and 11.0% for women. In multivariate analysis, old age, female gender, presence of cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairment, prolonged 6 m walk, smoking habit and alcohol intake were positively associated with ABI <0.9, while negative associations were observed with Vitamin C intake >100 mg per day, with the lowest OR for the range 141-190 mg (OR 0.4). Physical activity level, and self rated higher social standing in the community, while significant in univariate analysis, were not included as independent significant factors in the multivariate model. Lifestyle factors and the female gender were independent risk factors for atherosclerosis in the elderly Chinese population. © 2005.

33746832144	Comparative stigma of HIV/AIDS, SARS, and Tuberculosis in Hong Kong	This study compares public stigma towards three types of infectious diseases- human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB)-tests an attribution model of stigma, and explores the relationships between stigma and public attitudes towards government policies in Hong Kong. Using a population-based telephone survey, 3011 Hong Kong Chinese adults were randomly assigned to one of the three disease conditions and were interviewed about their attitudes and beliefs towards the assigned disease. Findings showed that public stigma was the highest towards HIV/AIDS, followed by TB and SARS. Using multi-sample model structural equation modeling, we found that the attributions of controllability, personal responsibility, and blame were applicable in explaining stigma across three disease types. Knowledge about the disease had no significant effect on stigma. Participants with less stigmatizing views had significantly more favorable attitudes towards government policies related to the diseases. The study is an important attempt in understanding the attributional mechanisms of stigma towards infectious diseases. Implications for stigma reduction and promotion of public awareness and disease prevention are discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

33748908069	A community model of group therapy for the older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A pilot study	Objective: A community-based programme for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in group sessions is designed, and the feasibility, acceptability and physical and psychosocial outcomes evaluated. Methods: Patients with COPD discharged from hospital, or those attending specialist outpatient clinic, with a history of hospital admission owing to COPD in the preceding 12 months were recruited. Those who had malignancy or were housebound were excluded. Group sessions were arranged once a week in a Community Centre, and consisted of two hourly sessions. The components of each session consist of education regarding the disease, breathing techniques, use of oxygen and other medication, smoking cessation, nutrition, dyspnoea management skills, relaxation and energy conservation techniques, introduction of social and community support, and strengthening as well as aerobic exercises. Assessments before and after intervention include lung function, 6 minutes walk test (6MWT), general Health Questionnaire (GHQ), the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and a COPD knowledge Questionnaire. A programme evaluation was carried out using questionnaire and group discussions. Results: Forty-four subjects were recruited, with 75% completing the programme, and 20% with drawing for unavoidable reasons. Statistically significant improvement was noted in all domains of the GHQ, SGRQ, and knowledge test, while the mean 6MWT improved, although statistical significance was not reached. Subjects were enthusiastic about the provision of this service in helping them cope with the disease through empowerment and mutual support. Conclusion: A group community intervention programme for COPD patients is feasible and acceptable, with positive psychosocial outcomes. Such a model could be further developed and cost-effectiveness evaluated as a model of chronic disease management in the community. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

Elderly people are at risk of under nutrition, and also have higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and depression. Objective: To examine the relationship between nutrient intake and psychological health in the elderly, adjusting for confounding factors. Subjects: Three thousand nine hundred and ninety-ninemen and women aged 65 years and over living in the community, with approximately equal numbers in three age groups: 65-69, 70-74, 75+ years. Methods: Dietary intake was assessed using a 7-day food frequency questionnaire. Cognitive function was assessed by the cognitive part of the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSID). Depression was assessed using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Information was also collected for confounding factors: demographics, educational level, socioeconomic status, medical history, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine associations between lifestyle and dietary variables, and CSID and GDS, controlling for confounders. Results: Both CSID and GDS scores were associated with co-morbidity, demographic and socioeconomic factors. Few associations between lifestyle factors and CSID score were observed. Dietary factors inversely associated with GDS score include total fat intake, vitamins A, B

33947287806	Examining attribution model of self-stigma on social support and psychological well-being among people with HIV+/AIDS	Among various infectious diseases, HIV/AIDS is considered to be one of the most stigmatizing conditions. Using a prospective design, the present study attempted to test the attributional pathway from perceived control to responsibility to self-blame and finally to self-stigmatization, and to examine the social and psychological sequelae of stigma among a sample of 119 people with HIV/AIDS (PWHA) in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling findings showed that the model had good fit to the data. Although the linkage between the attributions of control, responsibility, and blame was confirmed, the relationship of blame to self-stigma was not significant. Self-stigma was found to dampen social support and lead to psychological distress half a year later. The present study challenged the adequacy of attributional factors in understanding self-stigmatization and demonstrated the impact of stigma on psychological adjustment among PWHA. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

34147219960	Effects of use of alternative therapies on quality of life and healthcare spending	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a costly disease that causes much morbidity and mortality in the world, and it was the sixth leading cause of disability in developed countries. We aim to study the utilization pattern of alternative therapies and their effects on quality of life and personal health spending in Chinese OA patients in Hong Kong. Five-hundred forty-seven patients with OA from four regional hospitals in Hong Kong were recruited, and we measured various types of alternative therapies, SF-36 scales, an overall Health Utility Index derived from a pre-scored multi-attribute classification system based upon SF-36 health surveys, health spending per person and out-of-pocket payments and side-effects. The study shows that out of the 547 OA patients, the patients have used a wide spectrum of alternative therapies and often used a multiplicity of them. Payment for alternative therapies constitutes 5% of the overall personal healthcare spending, and 29% of the out-of-pocket payments. The use of alternative therapies was significantly associated with higher personal healthcare spending (p = 0.01), after adjusting for socioeconomic variables, years of OA and severity of OA. The use of alternative therapies was not significantly associated with an improvement in the quality of life in the regression analysis (p = 0.64). The use of alternative therapies was statistically significant associated with the side effects, including gastric discomfort and gastric ulcer/bleeding (p = 0.04, 0.02, respectively). Alternative therapies were used extensively by OA patients in Hong Kong. Clinicians, health policy makers, and insurance carriers should be aware of the potential health and economic effects in practice and policy formulation. © 2007 World Scientific Publishing Company Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Science and Medicine.

36248994730	Effectiveness of a lifestyle modification programme in weight maintenance in obese subjects after cessation of treatment with Orlistat	Objective: To examine the efficacy of a lifestyle modification programme in weight maintenance for obese subjects after cessation of treatment with Orlistat. Methods: Fifty-five subjects with and without diabetes mellitus were randomized to a lifestyle modification programme or to usual care at the end of 6 months' treatment with Orlistat. The intervention programme was nutritionist led, consisting of components of dietary management, physical activity, peer group support and discussion using techniques of self-monitoring, stimulus control and cognitive restructuring. Anthropometric indices, body composition, basal metabolic rate, blood pressure, fasting glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin, lipid profile, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, dietary intake, physical activity level, and quality of life were assessed before and after the intervention period. Results: Subjects in the intervention group maintained their weight loss and favourable anthropometric, metabolic, dietary intake, physical activity and quality of life profiles, while most parameters deteriorated in the usual care group, being more marked in subjects with diabetes. The magnitude of weight gain was comparable to that lost during Orlistat treatment. Conclusion: A specially designed nutritionist-led lifestyle modification programme for obese subjects is effective in weight maintenance after treatment with Orlistat, in the absence of which the benefits of drug treatment were lost. The magnitude of the effect of lifestyle modification is comparable to that observed with Orlistat. © 2007 The Authors.

0033923834	Validation of prediction equations for basal metabolic rate in Chinese subjects	Objectives: To examine the validity of existing prediction equations for basal metabolic rate (BMR) and two generated regression equations in healthy Chinese subjects and patients with chronic diseases. Subjects: One-hundred and thirty-four healthy Chinese volunteers of aged 16-88 among staff working in Shatin Hospital and their relatives, and 30 elderly patients with heart disease, stroke and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD) were recruited. Interventions: Height, weight, biceps and triceps skinfold thickness, body fat percentage, and BMR were measured in the healthy subjects and patients. Two regression equations were derived from 70 healthy Chinese subjects. Three existing equations (WHO, Liu and Jia equations) and two derived equations were then cross-validated in 64 subjects and 30 patients. Results: For the healthy Chinese subjects, as well as patients, the BMR calculated by Liu was the closest to the measured BMR among all the equations, although there was slight underestimation for patients. Conclusion: This study confirms that the Liu equation is the most appropriate for predicting BMR in healthy Chinese subjects, but it underestimates the BMR in those with chronic diseases. Fat-free mass is the best predictor of measured BMR.

0033925162	Cost estimates for chronic diseases	With increasing chronic disease and disability burden as a result of the aging of populations worldwide, cost estimates of disease and disability are important in determining: (i) the most cost-effective methods in delivering healthcare in order to maximise resources; and (ii) health policies and resource allocation. Cost may be divided into direct, indirect and intangible costs. Economic evaluations include cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility studies. In obtaining data for these studies, a multidisciplinary effort is required. Data include epidemiological, healthcare utilisation and cost data (e.g. based on disease-related groups), outcome measures and national sickness, unemployment and productivity figures. Examples of cost-of-illness studies show that chronic diseases constitute a significant economic burden for societies, in terms of either direct or indirect costs. Using such data, healthcare policies may be formulated towards cost reduction, whether preventive or interventional. Decisions regarding choice of drug treatments or methods of service delivery may also be based on such information. Conflicting perspectives from healthcare providers, society or individual viewpoints may render decisions regarding resource allocation based on such estimates controversial.

0033967503	The influence of income on morbidity, mortality and dependency in elderly Hong Kong Chinese	The association between income and mortality, morbidity and dependency is examined in a 3-year prospective follow-up study of 2032 subjects aged 70 years and above in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. Subjects were recruited using stratified disproportional random sampling of the Old Age and Disability Allowance Schemes, covering over 90% of the population. Subjects were interviewed at baseline and after 36 months. Presence or absence of disease was based on self-report of doctor diagnosis together with a check of medication taken. Functional status was measured using the Barthel Index. For the disease analysis, subjects with the disease being analyzed at baseline were excluded; similarly for the dependency analysis, subjects who were dependent at baseline were excluded. Chi-square test, univariate and multiple logistic regression were used to examine the association between income and mortality, development of new disease, and dependency. There was no association between income and mortality, or with development of new disease. Development of dependency was associated with lower income at baseline. An income of less than HK$1000 per month increased the risk of dependency by 1.8-fold (95%CI 1.1-2.9). However, this association disappeared after adjustment for age and sex. Absolute income is not an important factor contributing to mortality, morbidity and dependency in elderly Chinese aged 70 years and above. A freely accessible health and social service at low or no cost, the survivor effect, or other factors may account for the lack of association with income, contrary to findings from studies of whole populations worldwide. Therefore manipulating income alone is unlikely to affect these outcomes in the elderly. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

38149064672	Handicap and its determinants of change in stroke survivors: One-year follow-up study	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - Stroke, a major health issue affecting the elderly, limits their participation in society. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in stroke survivors' handicap levels and to identify their determinants in the subacute phase from 3 months to 1 year. METHODS - Data were collected from a prospective cohort of 303 Chinese stroke survivors with the use of questionnaires, including the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living-Chinese Version (IADL-CV), Barthel Index, Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination, Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale, and the Chinese version of the London Handicap Scale. RESULTS - A total of 297 and 268 patients were successfully followed up at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Whereas IADL remained unchanged throughout, we found an improvement in Barthel Index but a deterioration in the Chinese Geriatric Depression Scale score at 12 months. Multilevel modeling revealed improvements in the mobility and social integration handicap domains and a deterioration in the orientation domain at 12 months. Overall handicap remained unchanged. At 12 months, depression was most significantly and independently associated with poststroke handicap, and advanced old age alone (>80 years) was associated with clinically significant deterioration in handicap. CONCLUSIONS - Even though IADL remained static at 1 year, mobility and social integration handicap dimensions can be improved in the early community phase after stroke. Nonphysical factors such as depression were confirmed to be significantly associated with handicap. Rehabilitation should target the high-risk group of very elderly stroke survivors who were 4 times more likely to deteriorate in handicap. © 2008 American Heart Association, Inc.

34247595860	Use of Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China	Objective: The role of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a part of the Hong Kong health care system was not formally recognized until the handover of the city's sovereignty from the United Kingdom to mainland China in 1997. Population-representative data collected in a Thematic Household Survey (THS) in 2002 provided the first large-scale, cross-sectional study of utilization of TCM after 1997. Materials and Methods: Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 31,762 noninstitutional and institutional residents, a representative sample of Hong Kong's population of 6,504,255. Results: Among all respondents, 3.9% preferred TCM when they experienced medical problems. Of those reporting symptoms of medical problems in the 30 days preceding the THS, 1.8% had utilized TCM regularly in the past 6 months; 8.8% had consulted a TCM practitioner, and 2.7% had used TCM over-the-counter products. The utilization rate of TCM for respondents younger than 14 years was lower in all categories. Among patients who claimed to have medical benefits or insurance policies (N = 12,869), 14.5% were covered for TCM. Logistic regression analysis showed that preference for TCM was higher among women, older persons, and those with lower scores on the General Health Survey Short Form (SF-12), chronic disease, and higher education levels. Being single, institutionalized, and an older patient with a chronic disease were negatively associated with choice for and usage of TCM. Respondents with a higher education level and chronic disease patients were more likely to have insurance coverage for TCM, while those who were older, chronic disease patients, and single persons were least likely to have such coverage. Conclusion: Compared to the pre-1997 studies, the THS of 2002 made three novel findings. First, respondents of higher socioeconomic class emerged as a new class of TCM users. Second, there was a low rate of TCM utilization among institutionalized elderly persons. Lastly, older respondents were less like to be covered by TCM insurance. This paper discusses the issues raised by the THS of 2002 and suggests areas for future research, including a better understanding of TCM accessibility among the elderly and possible financing opportunities for community TCM services. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

4143074542	Telerehabilitation - A new model for community-based stroke rehabilitation	Community resources for stroke clients are underdeveloped in Hong Kong and stroke survivors often face difficulties in community reintegration. We have examined the feasibility of using videoconferencing for community-based stroke rehabilitation. The sample comprised 21 stroke patients living at home. All the subjects participated in an eight-week intervention programme at a community centre for seniors. The intervention, which comprised educational talks, exercise and psychosocial support, was conducted by a physiotherapist via a videoconference link. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS), State Self-Esteem Scale (SSES), Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and a stroke knowledge test were administered at the start and end of the programme. In addition, at the start of the study the Geriatric Depression Scale 15-item Short Form, the Elderly Mobility Scale and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale were used to assess subjects' baseline status, and a focus group was also held at the end of the programme to gather qualitative findings. Nineteen subjects completed the eight-week intervention. The baseline functional status was high, although 52% had symptoms of depression. After the intervention, there were significant improvements in BBS, SSES and knowledge test scores and scores on all subscales of the SF-36. All the subjects accepted the use of videoconferencing for delivery of the intervention. The pilot study demonstrated the feasibility, efficacy and high level of acceptance of telerehabilitation for community-dwelling stroke clients.

58149360520	Self-perceived social status and health in older Hong Kong Chinese women compared with men	Economic and social factors are determinants of health, as are psychosocial factors. The present study compared self-perceived social status and its relation to health, health related quality of life and lifestyle in older women with men, adjusting for age, education level and maximum lifetime income. A cross-sectional study was conducted of 4,000 men and women aged 65 years and over in a community in the North Eastern part of Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region in China. Participants were asked to rate their community status, education, income and occupation, on two ladders, each with ten rungs. The distributions of the two ladder scores differed, showing that although participants may not have been ranked highly in terms of money, education and job respectability, they may have ranked their community standing highly. Women and older participants tended to rank their community standing highly in spite of lower ratings in the objective measures. A social gradient in self-perceived social status, independent of objective socioeconomic measures, was noted for physical performance and health-related quality of life, rather than related to presence of specific chronic diseases or lifestyle. However, the different ratings of the two ladders suggested that mechanisms by which the gradient operates may differ between women and men. Further studies are needed to explore the health and psychosocial consequences of the gender difference in self-rated social status. © 2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved.

84897531688	Ischemic heart disease hospitalization among older people in a Subtropical city - Hong Kong: Does winter have a greater impact than summer?	Globally, excess winter morbidity from ischemic heart disease (IHD) is reported. In subtropical regions, there is a need to quantify the difference in the adverse effect of cold winters compared with hot summers, particularly among the older people. Our objectives were to: (i) compare the effect of winter on IHD hospitalizations with that of summer; (ii) examine temporal trends in the excess winter hospitalizations; and (iii) investigate the effect of age, gender, and meteorological factors on predicting such excess. Inpatient admissions due to IHD as principal cause during June 2000 to February 2009 in public hospitals of Hong Kong were extracted for the population aged ≥65. An Excess Hospitalization in Winter vs. Summer (EHWS) Index was used to contrast the adverse effect of weather on hospitalizations in winter vs. summer. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate the trend and the predictors of such index. It was found that in a subtropical city, greater effect of winter on IHD hospitalizations than summer was observed, particularly among the oldest old (an index of 61.5% (95% CI: 49.5%-74.4%) for men aged ≥85 and 32.3% (95% CI: 25.5%-39.5%) for women aged ≥85). There was significant increasing trend in the index among those aged ≥85 but the age difference was less prominent among the women. Absolute level of coldness was not a significant factor, whereas the change in temperature was a significant factor, which implies that great fluctuation in temperature within a winter day had greater impact on occurrence of circulatory disease than an absolute temperature threshold. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84897605807	A randomized controlled trial to investigate the impact of a low glycemic index (GI) diet on body mass index in obese adolescents	Background: The role of a low glycemic index (GI) diet in the management of adolescent obesity remains controversial. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of low GI diet versus a conventional Chinese diet on the body mass index (BMI) and other obesity indices of obese adolescents. Methods. Obese adolescents aged 15-18 years were identified from population-recruited, territory-wide surveys. Obesity was defined as BMI ≥95th percentile of Hong Kong local age- and sex-specific references. Eligible subjects were randomized to either an intervention with low GI diet (consisting of 45-50% carbohydrate, 30-35% fat and 15-20% protein) or conventional Chinese diet as control (consisting of 55-60% carbohydrate, 25-30% fat and 10-15% protein). We used random intercept mixed effects model to compare the differential changes across the time points from baseline to month 6 between the 2 groups. Results: 104 obese adolescents were recruited (52 in low GI group and 52 in control group; 43.3% boys). Mean age was 16.7 ± 1.0 years and 16.8 ±1.0 years in low GI and control group respectively. 58.7% subjects completed the study at 6 months (65.4% in low GI group and 51.9% in control group). After adjustment for age and sex, subjects in the low GI group had a significantly greater reduction in obesity indices including BMI, body weight and waist circumference (WC) compared to subjects in the control group (all p <0.05). After further adjustment for physical activity levels, WC was found to be significantly lower in the low GI group compared to the conventional group (p = 0.018). Conclusion: Low GI diet in the context of a comprehensive lifestyle modification program may be an alternative to conventional diet in the management of obese adolescents. Trial registration number.

84898762287	A chinese chan-based mind-body intervention improves psychological well-being and physical health of community-dwelling elderly: A pilot study	Background: The aim of this study was to explore the potential benefits of the Dejian mind-body intervention (DMBI) for psychological and physical health in older Chinese adults. Methods: After confirmation of eligibility, the subjects were invited to receive DMBI once a week for 12 weeks. The intervention involved components of learning self-awareness and selfcontrol, practicing mind-body exercises, and adopting a special vegetarian diet. Interventionrelated changes were measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Chinese Constipation Questionnaire, and self-report ratings of health. Indicators of metabolic syndrome and walking speed were also measured. Results: Of the 44 subjects recruited, 42 (54.8% men) completed the study, giving an adherence rate of 95%. There was a significant reduction in perceived stress (P<0.05). A significant improvement was also found in systolic blood pressure among those who had abnormally high blood pressure at baseline (P<0.05). Physical fitness as reflected by walking speed was also significantly increased after the intervention (P<0.05). Sleep disturbances were reduced (P<0.01). Self-rated health was significantly enhanced, with the percentage rating very good health increasing from 14.3% at baseline to 42.8% after the intervention (P<0.001). No intervention effect was found for waist circumference, lipids and fasting blood glucose levels, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index global score, and constipation measures. Conclusion: The DMBI was feasible and acceptable, and subjects showed some improvements in psychological and physical health. A larger controlled trial is needed to confirm these promising preliminary results. © 2014 Yu et al.

84898016973	Fatty pancreas, insulin resistance, and β-cell function: A population study using fat-water magnetic resonance imaging	OBJECTIVES:Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common chronic liver disease. Fatty pancreas has also been described but is difficult to assess. It is now possible to measure pancreatic and liver fat accurately with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to define the normal range of pancreatic fat and identify factors associated with fatty pancreas. In addition, the effect of fatty liver and fatty pancreas on insulin resistance (IR) and pancreatic β-cell function was studied.METHODS:Fat-water MRI and proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy were performed on 685 healthy volunteers from the general population to measure pancreatic and liver fat, respectively. On the basis of fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, the IR and β-cell function were assessed using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).RESULTS:Among subjects without significant alcohol consumption or any component of metabolic syndrome, 90% had pancreatic fat between 1.8 and 10.4%. Using the upper limit of normal of 10.4%, 110 (16.1%; 95% confidence interval 13.3-18.8%) subjects had fatty pancreas. On multivariable analysis, high serum ferritin, central obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia were independent factors associated with fatty pancreas. Subjects with both fatty pancreas and fatty liver had higher HOMA-IR than did those with either condition alone. Fatty pancreas was not associated with HOMA-β after adjusting for liver fat and body mass index.CONCLUSIONS:In all, 16.1% of this community cohort of adult Hong Kong Chinese volunteers had a fatty pancreas by our definition. Central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperferritinemia are associated with fatty pancreas. Individuals with fatty pancreas have increased IR. © 2014 by the American College of Gastroenterology.

42449110326	Influence of different health-care systems on health of older adults: A comparison of Hong Kong, Beijing urban and rural cohorts aged 70 years and older	Objective: To explore the hypothesis that better health status of elderly populations is primarily determined by the provision of freely accessible health service at low or no cost to the user and a social welfare system. Method: Information was collected by questionnaire from surveys of three cohorts of elderly (70 years and older) Chinese. Data from two health-care systems were compared: the low-cost or free government-subsidised system in Hong Kong, and the market-orientated user-pays system in urban (Beijing), and rural China. Results: The Beijing rural cohort had the best health profile, whereas the Hong Kong cohort had the worst, despite the better lifestyle practices in the Hong Kong and Beijing urban cohorts compared with the Beijing rural cohort, and higher socioeconomic status in the Beijing urban and Hong Kong cohorts. However, the Beijing rural cohort had the highest prevalence of functional limitations. Conclusion: While health-care systems may affect life expectancy at birth, psychosocial, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors influence subsequent health status of elderly people in a complex manner. © 2008 ACOTA.

42549116788	The influence of multi-morbidity and self-reported socio-economic standing on the prevalence of depression in an elderly Hong Kong population	Background. There has been an increasing prevalence of both depression and chronic medical conditions globally but the relationship between depression and multi-morbidity is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between depression, multi-morbidity (number of chronic medical conditions, and measures of socioeconomic standing (SES) in an elderly Hong Kong population. Methods. Cross sectional study. Information on clinically relevant depressive symptoms, measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and demographic and chronic medical conditions were collected using standardized questionnaires. Information collected on SES included educational status (ES), maximum ever income (MEI), and self-perceived social standing in local community (SES-COM) and in Hong Kong generally (SES-HK). Analysis was conducted using multiple logistic regression. Results. Depression rates were similar in men and women (GDS caseness 8.1% vs 8.4%). Multi-morbidity of chronic medical conditions was common (40% of men and 46% of women had three or more). In the overall sample, the prevalence of depression was associated with the number of chronic medical conditions (OR 1.27; CI: 1.16-1.39). In addition, SES-HK and SES-COM were significant independent variables. Conclusion. In this elderly Hong Kong population, depression prevalence rose markedly with number of chronic medical conditions and SES-HK and SES-COM. © 2008 Wong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

44249096169	In patient stroke rehabilitation efficiency: Influence of organization of service delivery and staff numbers	Background. Outcomes of inpatient stroke rehabilitation need to be reviewed in terms of optimal resource utilization (staff time, service organization, and duration of stay). We compared FIM efficiency scores between three hospitals, and also variation in FIM scores over a ten year period in one hospital undergoing reduction in staff numbers, to examine the relationship between outcome and service characteristics. Method. This is a retrospective study comparing the mean FIM efficiency for stroke patients (FIM score - FIM admission score) divided by duration of stay for 2005 among three rehabilitation hospitals adjusting for age and baseline FIM score, and a longitudinal study of changes in mean FIM efficiency during a ten year period in one hospital, to examine the effects of different service organization and staff numbers. Results. FIM efficiency (FIMEG) was inversely associated with age, and positively associated with admission FIM score. FIMEG was higher in the hospital with a coordinated care plan involving medical, nursing, occupational, physiotherapy staff and other healthcare providers working as a team, with a seamless interface with community rehabilitation services. Over a ten year period, reduction in staff numbers was associated with reduction in FIMEG, which may be offset to some extent by service re-engineering. Conclusion. Within hospital organization of stroke rehabilitation services may influence outcome. A critical number of staff may be identified for the provision of services, below which rehabilitation efficiency may be affected. © 2008 Woo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

61949385875	Social support and psychological adjustment to SARS: The mediating role of self-care self-efficacy	The study tested the model of perceived support from medical staff and family/friends on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors' mental health as mediated by self-care self-efficacy. One hundred and forty-three SARS survivors recruited from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority following 18 months recovery were surveyed by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires. Based on structural equation modeling, findings showed that self-care self-efficacy completely mediated the effects of perceived medical staff support and perceived family/friends support on mental health status. The model achieved a satisfactory fit, CFI = 0.98, NNFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.06, and explained 75.2% of the variance in mental health status. The study is the first attempt in understanding long-term psychological adjustment of SARS survivors. Findings may be applicable to other infectious disease outbreaks in informing psychosocial factors that are important to long-term recovery.

69649101095	Prevalence and correlates of musculoskeletal pain in Chinese elderly and the impact on 4-year physical function and quality of life	Objective: To examine the prevalence, correlates and prospective impact of musculoskeletal pain on physical and psychological function in a population health survey of elderly Chinese men and women. Study design: Cohort study. Methods: Four thousand men and women, aged 65 years and over, living in the community in Hong Kong took part in this study. A questionnaire to determine demographics, socio-economic status, medical history, smoking, alcohol intake and level of physical activity was administered by an interviewer. Participants were asked about the presence of pain in the back, neck, hip and knee in the past 12 months. They were re-interviewed after 4 years of follow-up to document physical performance measures, psychological function and occurrence of falls, fractures and mortality. Results: Overall, back pain was most prevalent (48%), followed by knee (31%), neck (22.5%) and hip (8.9%) pain; the values was nearly twice as high in women compared with men for all sites. The presence of pain was not correlated with age, but was associated with various measures of socio-economic status as well as comorbidities. Baseline prevalence of pain was related to physical performance and quality-of-life measures, and fracture incidence after 4 years of follow-up. Conclusion: Musculoskeletal pain is prevalent among elderly men and women, being much higher in the latter, giving rise to considerable functional and psychological impairments. Osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are likely to be the main underlying causes. The condition may be considered part of the frailty syndrome, and in this context, prevention and management represent major public health challenges. © 2009 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Design: A total of 1820 residents living in a representative sample of residential care facilities were surveyed. Results: The survey showed a substantial proportion with cognitive dysfunction, mood problems, communication and vision problems, chronic disabling diseases, impairment in activities of daily living, and undernutrition. Programs of activities and rehabilitation were generally unavailable. Those in for-profit facilities had a worse profile. An approximate estimation of numbers of staff required based on case mix revealed considerable understaffing among the for-profit facilities. Conclusions: Issues of quality of care would be all the more important with anticipated future increase in the institutional population of older people. © 2009 American Medical Directors Association.

70349569953	Determinants of participation restriction among community dwelling stroke survivors: A path analysis	Background: Apart from promoting physical recovery and assisting in activities of daily living, a major challenge in stroke rehabilitation is to minimize psychosocial morbidity and to promote the reintegration of stroke survivors into their family and community. The identification of key factors influencing long-term outcome are essential in developing more effective rehabilitation measures for reducing stroke-related morbidity. The aim of this study was to test a theoretical model of predictors of participation restriction which included the direct and indirect effects between psychosocial outcomes, physical outcome, and socio-demographic variables at 12 months after stroke. Methods: Data were collected from 188 stroke survivors at 12 months following their discharge from one of the two rehabilitation hospitals in Hong Kong. The settings included patients' homes and residential care facilities. Path analysis was used to test a hypothesized model of participation restriction at 12 months. Results: The path coefficients show functional ability having the largest direct effect on participation restriction (β = 0.51). The results also show that more depressive symptoms (β = -0.27), low state self-esteem (β = 0.20), female gender (β = 0.13), older age (β = -0.11) and living in a residential care facility (β = -0.12) have a direct effect on participation restriction. The explanatory variables accounted for 71% of the variance in explaining participation restriction at 12 months. Conclusion: Identification of stroke survivors at risk of high levels of participation restriction, depressive symptoms and low self-esteem will assist health professionals to devise appropriate rehabilitation interventions that target improving both physical and psychosocial functioning. © 2009 Chau et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

70449366147	Clients' experiences of a community based lifestyle modification program: A qualitative study	There is little information about how clients attending lifestyle modification programs view the outcomes. This qualitative study examined the clients' experience of a community based lifestyle modification program in Hong Kong. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 clients attending the program. Clients perceived the program had positive impacts on their health and nutrition knowledge. They experienced frustration, negative emotion, lack of motivation, and pressure from others during the program. Working environment and lack of healthy food choices in restaurants were the major perceived environmental barriers for lifestyle modification. Clients valued nutritionists' capability of providing professional information and psychological support in the program. Our results suggest that nutritionist's capability of providing quality consultations and patient-centered care are important for empowering clients achieve lifestyle modification. © 2009 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.

0035234067	The role of telenursing in the provision of geriatric outreach services to residential homes in Hong Kong	A residential nursing home in Hong Kong was linked to the community geriatric assessment team based in a regional hospital using videoconferencing equipment operating at 384 kbit/s. The feasibility of providing nursing services and their acceptability to users were evaluated over 12 months. There were 198 occupants of the nursing home and their mean age was 82 years (range 60-101). Services included patient education regarding the use of a metered dose inhaler, wound management and a falls prevention programme, together with assessment of clients' need for infirmary care and the risk of aspiration. The acceptability of the system to the clients and nursing home staff was also assessed. It was found that 89% of such services could be carried out via telemedicine, and only 11% required on-site visits. There was an increase in the proportion of patients correctly using inhalers as well as a reduction in the number of falls. More consultations were conducted by the nurse (an increase of 76% per month) and an additional 8.4 patients per month could be attended to by the nurse compared with 5 patients when on-site visits were used. Acceptability to clients and nursing home staff was good. The problem of lack of resources to support elderly residential care institutions makes service delivery via telemedicine appear economically attractive, as well as facilitating improvements in the quality of long-term care.

This qualitative and quantitative study examined nutritionist's skills, attributes, and beliefs towards nutrition counseling during a lifestyle modification intervention program, and whether this affected the patient's weight outcome. 24 nutrition consultations were observed during the program and the nutritionists were interviewed for their perception on practice (n = 4). A statistically significant difference was observed between the nutritionists in regard to patient's weight change after adjustment for age and baseline weight (p < 0.001). Key nutritionist skills identified that influenced weight outcome were meticulous investigation of the underlying obesity cause, identification of the subject's stage of change, and psychological support. © 2010 by the authors; licensee Molecular Diversity Preservation International.

77950909739	Prevention of overweight and obesity: How effective is the current public health approach	Obesity is a public health problem that has become epidemic worldwide. Substantial literature has emerged to show that overweight and obesity are major causes of co-morbidities, including type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, various cancers and other health problems, which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. The related health care costs are also substantial. Therefore, a public health approach to develop population-based strategies for the prevention of excess weight gain is of great importance. However, public health intervention programs have had limited success in tackling the rising prevalence of obesity. This paper reviews the definition of overweight and obesity and the variations with age and ethnicity; health consequences and factors contributing to the development of obesity; and critically reviews the effectiveness of current public health strategies for risk factor reduction and obesity prevention. © 2010 by the authors.

To improve the quality of care of these patients, we carried out a continuous quality improvement initiative among medical and nursing staff of a convalescent facility. Design: Evaluation of a quality improvement initiative. Setting: Nonacute institution in Hong Kong SAR, China. Participants: The participants were patients with advanced chronic diseases not opting for active treatment. Intervention: The intervention was a continuous quality improvement process carried out over a 3-month period, consisting of service reengineering, provision of guidelines and educational material, and interactive sessions to achieve culture change among staff. Evaluation before and after the intervention included patient symptoms checklist and quality-of-life measures for patients; quality-of-life and cost-of-care index for family members; quality-of-life and carer burden for staff; and use of various health care services. Results: There were 80 and 89 participants in the pre- and post-intervention phase. The initiative resulted in shorter duration of stay, fewer investigations, fewer transfers back to the affiliated acute care hospital, and more follow-up by the outreach team, with no significant difference in mortality after adjusting for age and comorbidity. Symptoms of pain and cough were reduced, while there was a trend toward more constipation but less dizziness. Family members' satisfaction improved. Conclusions: It is possible to improve quality-of-life care for elderly patients with end-stage chronic diseases by staff education, and culture and system change, not only without additional resources, but likely savings were achieved in terms of reduced use of health care resources. © 2011 American Medical Directors Association.

79953161787	Psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale	Background: Effective self-care is the cornerstone of the successful management of heart failure (HF). The European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale is a brief, reliable and valid scale to measure this important construct among patients with HF. Although the EHFScBS has been translated to different languages, no Chinese version is available. Indeed, previous findings investigating the psychometric properties of EHFScBS indicated ambiguity of the conceptual structure of this scale. Aim: The aim of this study was to translate the European Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour Scale (EHFScBS) into Chinese and to test its psychometric properties in the Chinese patients with HF. Methods: The EHFScBS (English Version) was translated to Chinese using Brislin's forward and backward translation method. Panel review was used to examine its semantic equivalence and content validity. The EHFScBS (Chinese Version) was then tested with a convenience sample of 143 Chinese HF patients who attended a specialist clinic from January to September 2007. Results: The content validity index (CVI) of the EHFScBS (Chinese version) was satisfactory (Item CVI. =0.96; Scale CVI. =0.89), with Cronbach's alpha 0.82. Convergent validity was supported by a moderate relationship, statistical significant with a measure for social support (r=-0.36, p<. 0.001). However, the findings did not support the hypothesised three-factor structure of the EHFScBS (Chinese Version). Instead, all items except one fit well a two-factor structure to measure help-seeking and regimen-complying behaviours. Conclusion: The adequate psychometric properties and clear conceptual structure of EHFScBS (Chinese Version) warrant its use in Chinese patients with HF. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79955804203	High prevalence of colorectal neoplasm in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis	Objective: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects 20-40% of the general adult population. Due to shared risk factors, it is postulated that NAFLD patients have an increased risk of colorectal neoplasm and should be a target group for screening. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of colorectal neoplasm in NAFLD patients and the risk of colorectal neoplasm in relation to the severity of NAFLD histology. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University hospital with case recruitment from the community and clinics. Patients: Subjects aged 40-70 years were recruited for colonoscopic screening from two study cohorts: (1) community subjects; and (2) consecutive patients with biopsy proven NAFLD. In the community cohort, hepatic fat was measured by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of colorectal adenomas. Advanced colorectal neoplasm was defined as cancer or adenomas with villous architecture or high grade dysplasia. Results: NAFLD patients (N=199) had a higher prevalence of colorectal adenomas (34.7% vs 21.5%; p=0.043) and advanced neoplasms (18.6% vs 5.5%; p=0.002) than healthy controls (N=181). Thirteen of 29 (45%) NAFLD patients with advanced neoplasms had isolated lesions in the right sided colon. Among patients with biopsy proven NAFLD, patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (N=49) had a higher prevalence of adenomas (51.0% vs 25.6%; p=0.005) and advanced neoplasms (34.7% vs 14.0%; p=0.011) than those with simple steatosis (N=86). After adjusting for demographic and metabolic factors, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis remained associated with adenomas (adjusted OR 4.89, 95% CI 2.04 to 11.70) and advanced neoplasms (OR 5.34, 95% CI 1.92 to 14.84). In contrast, the prevalence of adenomas and advanced neoplasms was similar between patients with simple steatosis and control subjects. Conclusions: Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is associated with a high prevalence of colorectal adenomas and advanced neoplasms. The adenomas are found more commonly in the right sided colon. Colorectal cancer screening is strongly indicated in this high risk group.

0036281035	Lifestyle factors and health outcomes in elderly Hong Kong Chinese aged 70 years and over	Background: Although increasing emphasis is being placed on strategies for successful aging, few studies have examined the relationship between lifestyle factors and mortality and other health outcomes in the old-old population. Objective: To examine the impact of physical activity, dietary habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption on 3-year mortality and other health outcomes. Methods: 2,032 Chinese subjects aged 70 years and older (mean age 80 years) were recruited territorywide by proportional random sampling and followed for 3 years. Baseline information was obtained by interview on level of physical activity, dietary habits (frequency of consumption per week of major food groups), alcohol consumption, and smoking habits. Outcome measures include mortality, self-perceived health status, frequency of hospitalization, geriatric depression score, and development of new diseases (stroke, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fractures). Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of lifestyle factors on each health outcome, with and without adjustment for age and baseline health status. Results: The mortality risk is reduced with increasing physical activity, daily fish intake and moderate alcohol consumption, and avoidance of smoking; hospitalization is inversely associated with increasing activity; better self-perceived health is associated with moderate alcohol consumption and a non-smoking status, and there is an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and increasing activity and moderate alcohol consumption. After adjustment for age and baseline health status, higher levels of physical activity are associated with decreased mortality and hospitalization; non-smokers have reduced mortality and a better self-perceived health, and moderate alcohol consumption is also associated with better self-perceived health. Conclusion: Lifestyle factors may influence health outcomes even in the old-old population. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

79958839607	Quality of end-of-life care for non-cancer patients in a non-acute hospital	Aims and objectives. Few surveys have been carried out documenting the quality of life for non-cancer patients in general district hospitals reaching the final trajectory towards death. We carried out a survey of 80 patients facing the final stages of their chronic illness as well as their carers and hospital staff. Background. With increasing life expectancy, a large majority of patients are older, where palliative care principles for patients with cancer are equally applicable. Few surveys have been carried out documenting the quality of life for non-cancer patients in general district hospitals reaching the final trajectory towards death in terms of patients' and carers' perspective, compared with the more extensive literature for patients with cancer. Design. Survey. Methods. Assessment tools include symptom check list, geriatric depression scale, Chinese Death Anxiety Inventory and the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire for patients; SF-12 and the Chinese cost of care index for informal carers; and the Chinese Maslach Bumout and Death Anxiety Inventories for hospital staff. Results. Lower-limb weakness (92·5%), fatigue (86·2%), oedema (85%), dysphagia (58·2%) and pain (48·8%) were the most common symptoms in this group of patients. The mean Chinese Caregiver Stress Index score was 45·93 (SD 6·45) (maximum score=80). For staff, the mean SF-12 physical component score was lower than the Hong Kong population average. Conclusion. The findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the quality of end-of-life care. Relevance to clinical practice. Patients in the final stages of many chronic illnesses have high prevalence of symptoms comparable to those of patients with cancer. Raising awareness and improving training for all health care professionals, formulating guidelines and care pathways and incorporating quality of care as key performance indicators are measures to improve the quality of end-of-life care. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

81155124481	Identifying service needs from the users and service providers' perspective: A focus group study of Chinese elders, health and social care professionals	Aim. This is a preliminary study to identify older people service needs in Hong Kong from the users' and service providers' perspective. Background. As the Hong Kong population is ageing rapidly, it is important to identify the needs for care of older people. Although a wide variety of medical and social services have been provided to meet the needs of older people, there has been little evaluation from the users' or service providers' perspective regarding what the needs are and how well current service provisions match their needs. In recent years the importance of patient-centred care has been emphasised, where patient's expectation of care has been given a central role in guiding and improving the provision of health. However few studies have been carried out with respect to services for older people. Design. To identify the service needs, a focus group study was conducted. Both service providers and older people were interviewed. This preliminary study used a qualitative research method to identify older people's service needs, generating rich information which could be used to inform older people care service development. Method. Data were collected by conducting eight focus group discussions. The focus group interviews were audio-taped. Interviews were then transcribed and themes were identified. Results. The study identified several areas for improvement in services for older people, covering adequacy, accessibility and affordability of medical services, coordination of health and social care, quality of long-term care, negative perceptions and training needs. Some themes such as service adequacy and negative staff attitudes occurred in both older people and health professional focus groups. The themes of fast access, continuity of care and smooth transition, affordability, provision of information of available health and social services appear to be universal as these have also been identified in similar studies in other countries. Conclusion. In addition to other objective outcomes, such as duration of stay in hospital or re-admission rates after hospital discharges, changes in service provisions towards improvement should be evaluated from the users as well as professional care providers' perspectives. Relevance to clinical practice. Areas of improvement in service delivery include timely access, continuity, affordability, better coordination of health and social care, quality of care particularly in the long-term residential care setting and healthcare professionals' communication and caring skills and attitude. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84857046691	Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and advanced fibrosis in Hong Kong Chinese: A population study using proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transient elastography	Objective: Knowledge of the epidemiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is incomplete because liver biopsy cannot be performed on the general population to assess disease severity. New non-invasive tests allow accurate and safe assessment in healthy individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis in the general Hong Kong Chinese population. Methods: Subjects were recruited from the community by random selection from the government census database. Liver fat and fibrosis were assessed by protonmagnetic resonance spectroscopy and transient elastography, respectively. Results: Overall, 264 of 922 (28.6%) subjects had intrahepatic triglyceride content ≥5%. Excluding 12 subjects with significant alcohol consumption, the population prevalence of NAFLD was 27.3% (95% CI 24.5% to 30.2%). Each component of the metabolic syndrome increased the risk of fatty liver in a dosedependent manner (prevalence of 4.5% in subjects without any component and 80.0% in those with all five components). 8 (3.7%) patients with fatty liver had liver stiffness ≥9.6 kPa, a level suggestive of advanced fibrosis. Body mass index and alanine aminotransferase level were independent factors associated with liver stiffness. Together with other clinical prediction scores, the estimated prevalence of advanced fibrosis in patients with fatty liver in the community was <10%. Compared with non-drinkers, modest drinkers (<10 g per day) did not have higher risk of fatty liver after adjustment for demographic and metabolic factors. The liver stiffness was 4.7±1.9 kPa in modest drinkers and 4.6±1.7 kPa in non-drinkers (p=0.54). Conclusion: NAFLD is found in over a quarter of the general adult Chinese population, but the proportion of patients with advanced fibrosis is low. Modest alcohol consumption does not increase the risk of fatty liver or liver fibrosis.

84857363017	Hepatitis B virus infection and fatty liver in the general population	Background & Aims: In animal studies, expression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) proteins causes hepatic steatosis. We aimed to study the prevalence of fatty liver in people with and without HBV infection in the general population. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional population study in Hong Kong Chinese. Intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) was measured by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results: One thousand and thirteen subjects (91 HBV patients and 922 controls) were recruited. The median IHTG was 1.3% (0.2-33.3) in HBV patients and 2.1% (0-44.2) in controls (p <0.001). Excluding subjects with significant alcohol consumption, the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was 13.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4%, 20.6%) in HBV patients and 28.3% (95% CI 25.3%, 31.2%) in controls (p = 0.003). The fatty liver prevalence differed in HBV patients and controls aged 40-59 years but was similar in those aged 60 years or above. After adjusting for demographic and metabolic factors, HBV infection remained an independent factor associated with lower risk of fatty liver (adjusted odds ratio 0.42; 95% CI 0.20, 0.88; p = 0.022). HBV patients also had a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome (11.0% vs. 20.2%; p = 0.034), but the difference was mainly attributed to lower triglyceride levels. Among HBV patients, viral genotypes, HBV DNA level and hepatitis B e antigen status were not associated with fatty liver. Conclusions: HBV infection is associated with a lower prevalence of fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia and metabolic syndrome. Viral replication may affect lipid metabolism and this warrants further studies. © 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862795311	Non-invasive diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis by combined serum biomarkers	Background & Aims: The diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis (NASH) is limited by the need for liver biopsy. We aimed at testing the accuracy of cytokeratin-18 fragment (CK-18), adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) for the diagnosis of NAFLD and NASH. Methods: 146 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and 74 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. Serum CK-18, AFABP and FGF21 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Serum CK-18, AFABP, and FGF21 increased in a stepwise fashion in control subjects (median 103 U/L, 15.4 ng/ml, and 104 pg/ml), patients with non-NASH NAFLD (263 U/L, 18.9 ng/ml, and 249 pg/ml) and NASH (418 U/L, 19.4 ng/ml, and 354 pg/ml) (p <0.001, 0.060, and 0.016, respectively). The area under receiver-operating characteristics curve to diagnose NAFLD and NASH was 0.91 and 0.70 for CK-18, 0.66 and 0.59 for AFABP, and 0.84 and 0.62 for FGF21. At cut-offs of 203 and 670 U/L, CK-18 had 71% negative predictive value (NPV) and 77% positive predictive value (PPV) to exclude and diagnose NASH. A 2-step approach measuring CK-18 followed by FGF21 further improved the NPV to 74% and PPV to 82%. In a validation cohort of 51 patients with paired liver biopsies, the NPV and PPV of the 2-step approach were 67% and 78%, respectively. Conclusions: CK-18 is the most accurate biomarker for NAFLD and NASH. A two-step approach using CK-18 and FGF21 further improves the accuracy in diagnosing NASH. © 2012 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84862325218	Availability, use, and cultivation of support networks as predictors of the well-being of middle-aged and older Chinese: A panel study	Objectives. To examine the impact of the availability, use, and cultivation of a support network on the well-being of community-dwelling, middle-aged, and older Chinese. Methods. A total of 2,970 Hong Kong Chinese aged 40-74 years were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in 2004. Out of the original group of interviewees, 2,120 (71.4%) were interviewed again in 2005. Results. Structural equation modeling revealed a good fit of the model employing Wave 1 support network data and demographic characteristics to predict Wave 2 well-being. As hypothesized, the availability of important social ties and the cultivation of ones support networks were found to predict well-being one year later, but not the use of support networks to meet emotional, financial, or companion needs after controlling for demographic variables and baseline well-being. Discussion. Cultivating support networks can be interpreted as positive and active coping. Such cultivation is in line with what socioemotional selectivity theory predicts; specifically, when people age, they become more selective and concentrate on strengthening their relationship with those they are emotionally close to. We argue that network cultivation deserves more attention in theory, practice, and research to strengthen the resilience and adaptability of individuals approaching and experiencing old age.

0037333697	Efficacy of a specially designed hip protector for hip fracture prevention and compliance with use in elderly Hong Kong Chinese	Background: Hip protectors, while effective in prevention of hip fractures, have been designed for a Caucasian body build and may not be suitable for Asian subjects living in a subtropical climate. Objective: Hip protectors and accompanying shorts were specially designed for use for the Chinese body build and subtropical climate, and tested for compliance and efficacy in fracture prevention. Method: A pragmatic study examining compliance with the wearing of hip protectors, and effectiveness in preventing hip fractures (using a case control design), in 302 subjects wearing hip protectors and 352 control subjects. Results: Overall compliance varied from 55 to 70%. The relative risk for hip fracture was 0.18 (0.04-0.79), relative risk reduction 82%, and the number of subjects needing to wear a hip protector to prevent one fracture was 33 (19-117). Conclusion: Hip protectors adapted for use in Chinese people appear to reduce hip fractures in routine clinical practice.

0038164994	Comparison of Pueraria lobata with hormone replacement therapy in treating the adverse health consequences of menopause	Objective: Pueraria lobata (PL) is used as a traditional Chinese herbal remedy for menopausal symptoms, as well as an ingredient in preparations for conditions affecting menopausal women, such as osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, and some hormone-dependent cancers. The scientific basis for its action may be its action as a phytoestrogen. Design: To examine the effects of PL in comparison with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on lipid profile, sex hormone levels, bone turnover markers, and indices of cognitive function. For the study, 127 community-living, postmenopausal women aged 50 to 65 years were randomized to receive HRT (n = 43), PL (equivalent to 100 mg isoflavone; n = 45), or no treatment (n = 39) for 3 months. The following measurements were carried out at baseline and after 3 months for all participants: menopausal symptoms questionnaire; neuropsychological tests covering memory, attention, motor speed, and word-finding ability; quality of life (SF36); lipid profile; urinary deoxypyridinoline; dietary phytoestrogen intake and urinary phytoestrogen; estradiol; follicle-stimulating hormone; and luteinizing hormone. Results: Only participants in the HRT group showed a mean reduction in cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that was significantly different from that of the control group. No significant changes in lipid profile or follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone were observed in the PL group compared with the controls. However, both the HRT and PL groups showed an improvement in Mini-Mental State Examination score and attention span compared with the case of participants receiving no treatment. HRT and PL had different effects on cognitive function; HRT improved delayed recall, whereas flexible thinking seemed improved in the PL group. Conclusions: This study was unable to demonstrate a scientific basis for the use of PL for improving the health of postmenopausal women in general. However, the effect of PL on cognitive function deserves further study.

0037728847	Diet and glucose tolerance in a Chinese population	Background: Associations between dietary factors and glucose tolerance observed in Caucasian populations may not be applicable to Chinese populations, since the traditional Chinese diet contains plentiful vegetables and is rice-based (which has a lower glycemic index than potatoes). To address this question, the dietary patterns in 988 Hong Kong Chinese subjects with normal and impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes, were examined in a cross sectional survey to determine if there is any association between diet and glucose tolerance. Method: A stratified random population sample of 988 subjects (488 male, 500 female) was recruited. A food frequency questionnaire was used to determine dietary intake, and glucose tolerance was examined using the glucose tolerance test and the WHO criteria used to classify subjects into the three glucose tolerance categories. Results: Using the standardized world population of Segi, the prevalence rate for DM was 6.6% for men and 5.7% for women; and for IGT 10.3% for men and 15.4% for women aged 30-64 y. Abnormal glucose tolerance is associated with female gender, older age, lower educational attainment and higher body mass index (BMI). No clear pattern of association with dietary factors was observed after adjusting for confounding factors. However, if subjects with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m

84869013658	Trends in prevalence and mortality of dementia in elderly hong kong population: Projections, disease burden, and implications for long-term care	Background. We describe the trends in prevalence and mortality of dementia among older people in Hong Kong over time. Projections of the number of older people with dementia through 2039 and estimation of the disease burden are also included. Methods. Prevalence data were extracted from previous studies in Hong Kong. Mortality data were obtained from the Department of Health of Hong Kong. Projections of the number of people with dementia were calculated by applying the prevalence rates of dementia obtained from previous studies to Hong Kong population projections. The burden of dementia was measured by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Results. The number of people aged 60 and above with dementia is projected to increase by 222, from 103,433 in 2009 to 332,688 in 2039, with a large proportion of those living in institutions. The number of deaths due to dementia among people aged 60 and above has more than doubled between 2001 and 2009. Mortality rates for dementia have also risen. In 2006, about 286,313 DALYS were lost due to dementia. Conclusions. The information presented may be used to formulate a long-term care strategy for dementia of the ageing population in Hong Kong. © 2012 Ruby Yu et al.

However, the independent roles of both PA and CRF with MS are less firmly established. The combined contributions of PA and CRF with MS are less studied, particularly among Chinese women. There is uncertainty over the extent to which metabolically healthy but overweight/obese individuals have a higher CRF level. Methods. The sample included 184 Chinese women aged 55 to 69 years with available metabolic data and lifestyle factors.

84882811171	Community-based lifestyle modification programme for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A randomized controlled trial	Background & Aims Healthy lifestyle is the most important management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of a community-based lifestyle modification programme in the remission of NAFLD. Methods This was a parallel group, superiority, randomized controlled trial. 154 adults with NAFLD identified during population screening were randomized to participate in a dietitian-led lifestyle modification programme at 2 community centres or receive usual care for 12 months. The primary outcome was remission of NAFLD at month 12 as evidenced by intrahepatic triglyceride content (IHTG) of less than 5% by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Results 74 patients in the intervention group and 71 patients in the control group completed all study assessments. In an intention-to-treat analysis of all 154 patients, 64% of the patients in the intervention group and 20% in the control group achieved remission of NAFLD (difference between groups 44%; 95% CI 30-58%; p <0.001). The mean (SD) changes in IHTG from baseline to month 12 were -6.7% (6.1%) in the intervention group and -2.1% (6.4%) in the control group (p <0.001). Body weight decreased by 5.6 (4.4) kg and 0.6 (2.5) kg in the two groups, respectively (p <0.001). While 97% of patients with weight loss of more than 10% had remission of NAFLD, 41% of those with weight loss of 3.0-4.9% could also achieve the primary outcome. Conclusions The community-based lifestyle modification programme is effective in reducing and normalizing liver fat in NAFLD patients. © 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

84885754193	Improving the quality of end-of-life care in long-term care institutions	Purpose: A knowledge transfer program was carried out to improve knowledge in end-of-life care staff at all levels in residential care homes for the elderly, using a model similar to that developed for a non-acute care hospital setting. Methods: The program consisted of a series of seminars and on-site sharing sessions held in the hospital providing outreach support to residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs), as well as case discussions in the RCHEs. Evaluation was carried out using a knowledge assessment questionnaire before and after the initiative, as well as recording RCHE staff feedback and in-depth interviews with selected residents and their family members. Results: Knowledge gaps among RCHE staff existed in the areas of mortality relating to chronic diseases, pain and use of analgesics, feeding tubes, dysphagia, sputum management, and attitudes towards end-of-life care issues, which improved after the program. From the qualitative study, RCHE staff highlighted knowledge and service gaps, issues relating to use of feeding tubes and refusal to eat, lack of confidence in managing the dying process, application of Advance Care Plan (ACP) in the RCHE setting, and the need for training in these areas. Residents and family members highlighted the preference for death over suffering, planning for death, misconceptions about life-sustaining treatments and the advance directive (AD) document, and service gaps in advance care planning. Conclusion: Considerable knowledge and service gaps exist among staff and residents of RCHEs, which can be improved by the hospital geriatric team providing services to RCHEs. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

0042736064	Socioeconomic impact of osteoarthritis in Hong Kong: Utilization of health and social services, and direct and indirect costs	Objective. To determine the direct and indirect cost of osteoarthritis (OA) according to disease severity, and to estimate the total cost of the disease in Hong Kong. Methods. This study is a retrospective, cross-sectional, nonrandom, cohort design, with subjects stratified according to disease severity based on functional limitation and the presence or absence of joint prosthesis. Subjects were recruited from primary care, geriatric medicine, rheumatology, and orthopedic clinics. There were 219 patients in the mild disease category, 290 patients in the severe category, and 65 patients with joint replacement. A questionnaire gathered information on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, function limitation, use of health and social services, and effect on occupation and living arrangements over the previous 12 months. Costs were calculated as direct and indirect. Results. Low education and socioeconomic class were associated with more severe disease. OA affected family or close relationships in 44%. The average cost incurred as a result of side effects of medication is similar to the average cost of medication itself. Excluding joint replacement, the direct costs ranged from Hong Kong (HK) dollar $11,690 to $40,180 per person per year and indirect costs, HK $3,300-$6,640. The direct costs are comparable to those reported in Western countries; however, the ratio of direct to indirect costs is much higher than 1, in contrast to the greater indirect versus direct costs reported in whites. The total cost expressed as a percentage of gross national product is also much lower in Hong Kong. Conclusions. The socioeconomic impact of OA in the Hong Kong population is comparable to Western countries, but the economic burden is largely placed on the government, with patients having relatively low out-of-pocket expenditures.

84893760888	PNPLA3 gene polymorphism accounts for fatty liver in community subjects without metabolic syndrome	Background The rs738409 GG variant in patatin-like phospholipase 3 (PNPLA3) is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and disease severity. However, it remains unclear if it contributes to the development of NAFLD through affecting dietary pattern. Aim To examine the association among PNPLA3 gene polymorphism, dietary pattern, metabolic factors and NAFLD. Methods Liver fat and fibrosis were assessed by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and transient elastography in 920 subjects from a population screening project (251 had NAFLD). Dietary nutrient intake was recorded using a locally validated food-frequency questionnaire. Results The prevalence of GG genotype in NAFLD subjects was 20.7%, compared to 10.6% in controls (P < 0.001). Macronutrient intake was similar among subjects with different PNPLA3 genotypes. The presence of G allele was a predictor of NAFLD independent of nutrient intake and other metabolic factors (adjusted odds ratio to CC: CG, 2.00; GG, 2.68). In subjects without metabolic syndrome, G allele was even more closely correlated with NAFLD diagnosis (adjusted odds ratio to CC: CG, 2.22; GG, 3.39). The prevalence of NAFLD was only 12% in subjects with CC genotype and no metabolic syndrome, and increased to 34% in those with GG genotype and no metabolic syndrome. While NAFLD subjects had significantly lower fibre intake, there was no significant interaction between PNPLA3 and dietary pattern. Conclusions The G allele in PNPLA3 rs738409 increases the risk of NAFLD in the general population, especially in subjects without metabolic syndrome, independent of dietary pattern and metabolic factors. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84896704615	2013: That was the year that was	In caring for older people, geriatricians have always adopted a multi-domain approach, and this article reflects on the diverse aspects covered by journals in general medicine, geriatric medicine and gerontology in 2013. Topics were selected that represented developing or controversial areas that are important to care of increasingly frail older people. These include the increasing use of single physical performance measures in assessment, optimal body mass index, assessment of frailty and sarcopenia, dementia, diabetes treatment goals, end-of-life care, management of complexity and design of health and social services to meet complexity. The increasingly important role of patient and carer engagement in management of disease and syndromes is highlighted. In particular, two eloquent articles from prominent physicians who have been experiencing the ageing process and demands of being a dementia carer provide a timely reminder of what the reality is in grappling with the inexorable decline that occurs with ageing, and caregiving as the central core to what medicine is all about. Looking towards the future, the potential of robotic technology, modifying the physical and social living environment in improving quality of care and quality of life is described. © The Author 2014.

84901634003	A comparison of risk factors for mortality from heart failure in Asian and non-Asian populations: An overview of individual participant data from 32 prospective cohorts from the Asia-Pacific Region	Background: Most of what is known regarding the epidemiology of mortality from heart failure (HF) comes from studies within Western populations with few data available from the Asia-Pacific region where the burden of heart failure is increasing.Methods: Individual level data from 543694 (85% Asian; 36% female) participants from 32 cohorts in the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration were included in the analysis. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for mortality from HF were estimated separately for Asians and non-Asians for a quintet of cardiovascular risk factors: systolic blood pressure, diabetes, body mass index, cigarette smoking and total cholesterol. All analyses were stratified by sex and study.Results: During 3,793,229 person years of follow-up there were 614 HF deaths (80% Asian). The positive associations between elevated blood pressure, obesity, and cigarette smoking were consistent for Asians and non-Asians. There was evidence to indicate that diabetes was a weaker risk factor for death from HF for Asians compared with non-Asians: HR 1.26 (95% CI: 0.74-2.13) versus 3.04 (95% CI 1.76-5.25) respectively; p for interaction = 0.022. Additional adjustment for covariates did not materially change the overall associations. There was no good evidence to indicate that total cholesterol was a risk factor for HF mortality in either population.Conclusions: Most traditional cardiovascular risk factors including elevated blood pressure, obesity and cigarette smoking appear to operate similarly to increase the risk of death from HF in Asians and non-Asians populations alike. © 2014 Huxley et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84919730380	Telomere length is associated with decline in grip strength in older persons aged 65 years and over	Telomere length (TL) attrition is associated with chronic diseases characterized by chronic inflammatory states. Inflammatory cytokines may play a role in sarcopenia. This study examines the association between TL and the diagnosis of sarcopenia based on appendicular skeletal mass index (ASMI), grip strength, walking speed, and chair stand in a prospective study over 5 years of 976 men and 1,030 women aged 65 years and over living in the community. TL in leukocytes was measured using the quantitative PCR method. TL was divided into quartiles, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to examine its association with components of sarcopenia, adjusting for age, education, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and probable dementia. In both men and women, the percentage decline in grip strength over the 5-year period of follow-up was slower in those in the highest quartile of TL than those in the lower quartiles (multivariate-adjusted p < 0.05). No association between TL and the diagnosis of sarcopenia, ASMI, walking speed, or chair stand was observed. In conclusion, longer TL was associated with slower decline in grip strength in Chinese older persons.

10044243823	Impact of osteoarthritis on quality of life in a Hong Kong Chinese population	Objective. To measure the impact of osteoarthritis (OA) on quality of life in the Hong Kong Chinese population. Methods. This was a cross sectional, retrospective, non-random, cohort design stratifying disease severity and presence or absence of joint prostheses. Patients with OA (n = 574; 136 men and 438 women) were recruited from rheumatology, family medicine, orthopedics, and geriatric medicine clinics. They were divided into 2 equal groups based upon disease severity (either American College of Rheumatology functional classes I and II, or III and IV). The 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) OA Index were used. Results. Patients with severe disease had lower mean scores in all SF-36 domains and higher mean scores in all WOMAC domains, indicating poorer quality of life. Scores in patients who had had arthroplasty were better than those with severe disease only in certain domains: role physical, general health, vitality, and mental health (SF-36); and pain (WOMAC). Women with OA had poorer scores compared to men for bodily pain, general health, and mental health after adjusting for age and disease severity. Low educational attainment was independently associated with poorer scores when disease severity was taken into account. Conclusion: OA has a significant impact on quality of life, only partly ameliorated by arthroplasty, as assessed by the SF-36 and WOMAC in this population.

12144288024	Smoking, drinking and colorectal cancer in Hong Kong Chinese: A case-control study	Expert opinions differ on the causal role of cigarettes and alcohol in colorectal cancer. This study investigates such associations in Hong Kong Chinese. A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from April 1998 to March 2000. Newly diagnosed colorectal adenocarcinoma and sex- and age-matched inpatient controls without gastrointestinal and malignant conditions were included. Structured interviews were conducted using a validated questionnaire to study any association of smoking, drinking and the lifelong extent of such exposures with colorectal cancer risk. We successfully interviewed 822 cases and 926 controls. Current regular cigarette smokers had an increased rectal cancer risk (adjusted OR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.001-2.06). Increasing tertiles of smoking duration in ever smokers was also associated with increased rectal cancer risk (p trend = 0.038). An increased risk of colorectal cancer was found in current drinkers (adjusted OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.09-1.85) and in those who drank ≥ 4 days (current and ex-drinkers) or > 4 units (ever and ex-drinkers) weekly. Moreover, colorectal cancer risk was found to decrease with increasing duration of drinking abstention (p trend = 0.006). This is the first report of a positive association between cigarette smoking and rectal cancer risk in a Chinese population. Current drinkers and those who drank regularly and heavily had increased colorectal cancer risk. Moreover, this study is the first to show that drinking cessation could be effective in reversing such increased risk in a duration-dependent manner. These new findings are important for cancer prevention and healthcare promotion. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
