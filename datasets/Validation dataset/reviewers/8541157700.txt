1542711455	Experimental investigation on rheological characteristics of oils under different measuring conditions	The rheological characteristics of four kinds of degassed oils were investigated with three different methods under different conditions. The results showed that the apparent viscosities tested by three methods were evidently different. The viscosity tested by RV20 rotary viscometer is the smallest, and the viscosity in capillary is second, and that of oil flowing through the porous media set is the biggest. While oil flows in the porous media, the lower the rock permeability is, the higher the apparent viscosity of oil will be. At the same time, oil shows the non-Newtonian fluid characteristics and there exists an original pressure gradient. The oil composition, testing temperature and structure of porous media are the most important factors affecting the rheological characteristics of oils. It is suggested that rheological characteristics of underground oils can be tested by means of natural rocks, and the tested results could be of benefit to oilfield development.

On the basis of the paleokarst research achievements finished by our predecessors, a fuzzy remaining karstification strength index of comprehensively reflecting the remaining karstification strength was obtained through synthetically processing the above-mentioned parameters by fuzzy mathematical judgement method, and the reservoir evaluation was carried out by use of the fuzzy index. Accbrding to 93 development wells and exploration wells, selected from the Jingbian region of Changqing Gas Field, a comprehensive reservoir evaluation was finished by applying the synthetical fuzzy judgement method on the basis of one-factor evaluation. The reservoirs were divided into four types : Types I and II are reliable; Type III is of commercial values and Type IV is of non-commercial value. It is pointed out in the paper that there are a little differences among the results evaluated by the three weight sets selected under the condition of the relatively great weight values of permeability and effective connectivity index, so that the influence of the other parameters on the evaluation results is relatively weak) and) meanwhile, the evaluation results are quite consistent with the actual situation, therefore the reservoir evaluation can be quantified by use of such a method, which indicates that the synthetical fuzzy evaluation method is of a certain practical value to carbonat reservoir evaluation.

19544380562	Tight gas reservoir and reasonable scale of fracturing stimulation	According to statistical analysis of the stimulation effect of sand fracturing at Upper Shaximiao group in Xinchang gas reservoir, it is found that: 1 The good results have been achieved for most of gas wells to fracture, but the ideal results have not been achieved for a few wells, and the designed sand volume can't be completed for some wells; 2 There is no obvious correlativity between sand volume and stimulation effect, which is different with the convenient fracturing. Analyzed the geologic characteristics of Upper Shaximiao group in Xinchang gas reservoir, the article concludes that the reservoir consists of different level and size of permeable-reservoir bodies which exist in general rock tightenization. The permeable-reservoir bodies are isolated by tight shale and sand. They are the key factor of productivity of gas wells. The interlayers of the permeable-reservoir bodies are characterized with no permeability and high strength. They can stop the fracture extension of fracturing, which is the reason why tight gas reservoir fracturing is special. To develop the gas reservoir with low cost and high efficiency, studying the size of permeable-reservoir bodies and the relationship between fracturing results and operating parameters, the reasonable sand volume and fracture length is determined.

22144453249	Analyzing the influence factors of plunger gas lift and optimizing design	It is necessary to optimally design plunger gas lift to ensure that gas lift is normally operating and a higher daily gas production can be obtained. In this paper, the influence factors of plunger gas lift are firstly divided into three types: drive, resistance and volume. The affections of the factor variation on plunger gas lift and the restricted conditions are analyzed by dynamic model of plunger gas lift. In order to make plunger gas lift conduct normally, gas water ratio, formation pressure and gas production rate must be bigger than the minima and the pressure of gas transmission line and well depth must be less than the maxima. Only by reasonably matching the factors can plunger gas lift be done normally. Through analyzing the controllable factors of plunger gas lift, it is recognized that the optimizing design of plunger gas lift is essentially the optimization of open casing pressure and open time afterflow. The functions of optimizing plunger gas lift parameters are: not only is the production of gas well improved but also its producing time is prolonged. Attention must be paid to that the optimizing design of plunger gas lift aims at definite gas reservoir characteristics. While the parameters of gas reservoir change after applying plunger gas lift in a period of time, the optimizing design must be done over again to achieve the goal of optimization.

22344457652	Study on the non-Darcy percolation rules in the low permeable oilfield	The study of lab experiments show that non-Darcy flow features largely appear when fluid is seeping in low-permeability porous medium, and that both fluid viscosity and formation temperature will affect percolation rules. The lower the permeability is, the more obvious the impact of viscosity becomes. As the formation temperature increases, the pseudo-startup pressure will decrease, and the permeability curve will infinitely approach the beeline. Through theoretical analysis, a series of flow equations are built up to describe the non-linear flow in low-permeability porous medium and critical conditions are present, and from the aspect of boundary layer the generation of low-rate flow is theoretically analyzed and it is thought that as the pressure gradient increases, the thickness of boundary layer will decrease to a critical value-immobilized layer comes to be condensate into solidification front, and the flow is thus in the linear non-Darcy flow stage.

With the mathematical model, the effecting factors of wellhead temperature were studied and the changing law of wellhead temperature was determined for Dazhangtuo underground gas storage. The wellhead temperature increased rapidly at the early stage of well opening and then reached stability gradually. However, the gas production and the geothermal gradient were the main factors to influence the change of wellhead temperature whatever at the early stage of well opening or the stable period of wellhead temperature. The gas/liquid ratio and the well-bore structure only had a little influence on the wellhead temperature. The wellhead temperature changing was not related with the thermal conductivity of the formation at the early stage of well opening.

The movement features of plunger and liquid column were studied by using the momentum conservation equation. The change of gas pressure during movement of plunger was investigated with the mass conservation law. The gas pressures in the upper and below parts of plunger were discussed, in consideration of the effects of gas came from gas reservoir and output from well bore in the gas expanding equation and the effects of liquid loading in well bore on gas production of a gas reservoir. When the mass conservation law was utilized to establish theoretical models, the gas volume in the studied section was divided into a lot of control volumes, and the factors of controlled volume were assumed as invariable with time increment. A lot of movement equations for plunger and liquid column were given, and the dynamic models for calculating casing pressure and tubing pressure were established on the analysis of different factors.

29144443718	New braided river model in Sulige Gas Field of Ordos Basin	The eighth member of Shihezi Formation (He8) and the first member of Shanxi Formation (Shan1) of the Permian in Sulige Gas Field of Ordos Basin show obvious petrological, sedimentological and geologic climatic characteristics as follows. The clastic grain size is large, and the mineralogy and fabric maturity are low. The common cross-strata and massive structures showing strong water dynamic conditions are developed, and the vertical grain successions varies greatly. There are commonly lateral superposition of sandstones and exposure signs. There was seasonally dry geologic climate during the deposition period. These characteristics indicate the intervals deposited from the braided rivers. Based on the above characteristics, a new braided river model for the reservoirs of Sulige Gas Field was established. Compared with the traditional braided river models, the new model emphasizes that abandoned channels, crevasse splays and flooding plains were developed during the deposition periods of He8 and Shan1 Member and resulted in the frequent interlayers in the reservoir.

Based on analyzing percolation barrier, the flow unit division of the lower zone of He 8 member in Sulige gas field is carried out with the core data and petrophysical log interpretation data by the methods of cluster analysis and correlation analysis. 3 types of flow unit are plotted and the discriminant of each type is derived thus conducting flow unit division of all gas wells in the area. The research result shows that the main units with superior reservoir petrophsical properties lie in the middle location of the mid-channel bars and partly locating the top and bottom; the river facies is one of the main sedimentary microfacies controlling the units with superior reservoir petrophysical properties. The flow unit division method shows better underground structure of the reservoir fluid flowing than the sedimentary microfacies method.

According to the previous studies, the erosion flutes on the eastern and western borders are of the same origin, the latest data show that there are clear differences between them. The western ones are denudation ridges, which are the extension of the planar denudation during the change from central paleo-uplift to paleo-marine basin. Stratum lacuna of the Ordovician top in the western ones are caused by wind action, chemical corrosion, and leach; whereas that in the eastern ones by linear erosion and chemical erosion.

Based on the mercury injection capillary pressure data, the porous structure fractal model is established, and the fractal features of sandstone porous structure are explored. It is found that fractal features are different in different areas, and fractal dimension can be used to describe the heterogeneity of porous structure quantitatively. And it is found that the heterogeneity of sandstone pore distribution is strong as the fractal dimension is great. According to the porous structure fractal model and the changeability of porous structure and wettability, a theoretical forecast formula of the oil and water relative permeability is derived with the help of formula of function and capillary model. The relative permeability curve is forecasted depending on the theoretical forecast formula, and the forecasting results show the curves of theoretic and realistic are similar. Meanwhile, the formula can be used to forecast the oil and water relative permeability, classify the relative permeability curves of different formations after long water-drive and guide the oilfield production.

33745913635	Study on percolation characteristics of reservoirs' injection-production in Dazhangtuo underground gas storage	Dazhangtuo UST is a matching construction of Shaanxi-Beijing gas transmission pipeline. To guarantee the long operating life of the UST, it is necessary to study the porosity and permeability variation of the gas reservoir in the process of repeated strong injection and production. Thus, the porosity and permeability were measured repeatedly under the different overburden pressures and the repeated gas/water displacement were studied. The results of the experiments to measure the porosity and permeability repeatedly under the different overburden pressure showed that the variation magnitude of the porosity and permeability of the reservoir is less in the range of the operating pressure of the UST, and the variation was basically reversible. The results of the experiments of repeated gas/water displacement showed that the effective permeability of gas phase revealed downtrend in the process of repeated gas/water displacement, the co-flowing zones of water and gas decreased as the displacement times increased, and both the gas permeability under residual water and the water permeability under residual gas reduced. Therefore, as long as were injection-production wells located at the culmination of the gas reservoir structure, the reduce of the reservoir permeability caused by repeated gas/water displacement could be controlled, which can not only reach the purpose of high production with few wells, but also guarantee the normal operation of the gas storage.

The process of water driving as well as the form and distribution of residual oil in the physical micro-model was investigated, and water driving processes under different displacement rate, porous structure and viscosity ratio were simulated. With the help of the basic theory of fractal geometry, the box algorithm and R/S analysis relationship formula were deduced, which are used to quantitatively study residual oil microscopic fractal characteristics.

The results show that the residual oil decreases with the enhancement of displacement rate, and the residual oil increases with the increase of viscosity of crude oil. The volume dimension figures the quantity of residual oil and is related to the residual oil saturation and pore structure, while fractal dimension shows the homogeneity degree of the residual oil spatial distribution which becomes strong when the fractal dimension expands.

Lithology is the key factor impacting pore types, pore structure, physical properties of the reservoir and gas-containing property. The relationship between porosity and permeability, the types and structure of pore spaces, reserving and productive capacity and response character of electrical property in the reservoir with same lithologic property tend to coincidence.

The channel bar microfades controls the distribution of effective sandbodies, the paleo-nose structures in the early-middle stage of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion (from late Triassic to middle Jurassic) control the selective dissolution of the reservoir and the distribution of the favorable diagenetic fades with high-medium porosity, while the paleo-nose structures in the peak stage of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion (from late Jurassic to early Cretaceous) control the distribution of the gas wells with higher productivity.

84908464762	A novel quantitative petrophysical model for the stress sensitivity of tight sandstones	During the production life cycle of a reservoir, absolute permeability can change in response to an increase in the effective stress. In general, stress-dependent permeability has been measured using experimental methods with core samples. This paper focuses on presenting a petrophysical model of unequal diameter grains, based on the Hertz Theory, in that the true reservoir rocks are composed of closely packed grains of different sizes. The purpose of the model is to quantitatively evaluate the features of stress-dependent permeability in theory and to enhance the productivity of stress-dependent reservoirs. Control factors including the grain sizes, grain sorted behavior, mineral composition and cementation degree, which influence on the variation of stress-dependent permeability, can be calculated quantitatively and directly through the model while experiments cannot. Experiments were conducted on core samples of tight sandstones to verify the established model. Measurements were made at different confining pressures. The theoretical and experimental results obtained from the investigated rock were analyzed and compared.The results of the model show that control factors including the previous parameters have different influences on the stress-dependent permeability. The stress-sensitive curves calculated by the model have the desired behavior and are consistent with the laboratory data well, providing a more rigorous confirmation of the validity of the model and a new petrophysical insight into the significance and the role of the grain properties and grain contacts. The obtained theoretical results can exhibit the average features of stress-sensitive formation rather than the feature of only one point (a core plug sample) of a reservoir by laboratory test. Thus, the obtained formula through the model is of great benefit to being applied in reservoir numerical simulation.

54149101520	The influence of formation pressure change of DNA 2 reservoirs in permeability	A lot research has been carried out in regard to the relationship between permeability and effective stress, but the final conclusions are different and enormous amount of controversy is caused. A new method is proposed in this paper. The permeability under original formation effective stress should be used as reference and the ratio of permeability under in-situ stress to it should be used as evaluation criteria. The changes in permeability induced by the variation of formation pressure should include stress sensitivity and stress damage. According to the experimental data of core samples from DINA 2 gas reservoirs and the results of theory analysis, the stress sensitivity degree can be overestimated by using the permeability under conventional condition as reference than using the original in-situ permeability. Both the stress sensitivity and stress damage of permeability can reflect the effect of elasticity and plasticity of core samples on permeability, the relationship between permeability and effective stress acquired by experiment under different stress path should be adopted in different developing stages. These conclusions can provide some useful help for evaluating the effect of changep in reservoir pressure on the gas well production correctly and designing the program of formation damage control.

To offer guidance for next prospection and development of this field, it needs to make sure of type of the conglomerates and their time and space evolutions. Based upon drilling, core, logging and seismic data, the sedimentary characteristic, facies type and environment of the sandy conglomerates are explored. The gravels are mainly composed of pebbles and cobbles (grain diameter mostly between 2 and 20 mm) with poor sorting and multiple compositions that basically include intermediate and acidic lavas and pyroclastic rocks. The color, grain size, texture, sedimentary structure, lithofacies, log facies and depositional succession of the sandy conglomerates indicate deposits from gravel-dominated braided delta, which mainly developed delta front that mostly consist of underwater distributary channels and mouth bars. The gravels are better rounded within the upper part of FMYF, and the formed sandy conglomerates show great extension in space and could be deposited from grave-dominated braided delta with long flow, so that they make up of the main reservoirs of this sandy conglomerate gas field.

The composition of the culture medium used was presented. The reproductive ability of these bacteria was investigated at 50°C with a crude oil from the 1st Changqing oil production factory as carbon source: the logarithmic phase of growth started in 6-8 hrs and the stationary phase - in 12-14 hrs; TSD >60 g/L did not affect their growth, which was significantly slowed down at 90°C. The optimal ratios of the seven bacterial strains were established. The mixed bacterial culture of optimal composition was used to treat an oil saturated core at 50°C and the wax content, viscosity, and interfacial tension of the oil recovered from the treated core were decreased from 2.2%, 72. 8 mPa · s, and 33. 7 mN/m to 1. 8%, 61.7 mPa·s, and 18.9 mN/m, respectively, and the carbon number distribution of saturated hydrocarbons was shifted toward low carbon number direction. This mixed bacterial culture was used in seven production wells for releasing reservoir blockages and stimulating pay layers by injecting 1000 kg bacterial cultures and 1000 kg culture medium per well according to a procedure stating, in particular, separately squeezing each of seven bacterial cultures of optimized ratios in isolated single slug. As results of bacterial treatments, watercut drop and oil productivity raise in 3-9 months and decrease in skin factor were observed in 5 wells while two wells gave no positive response.

With the progress in development and more available data, two groups of shear faults with NE direction and NW direction in the gasfield were found during the formation comparison and seismic data interpretation. There are four kinds of combination forms, namely, faulted-steps combination with co-existence of normal and reverse faults, same-dip normal and reverse faults combination, same-dip normal faults combination, and back-folding reverse faults combination. These two groups of faults were generated due to the strong tectonic movement during the Yanshan and Himalayan periods. Their properties and distribution features are consistent with the regional structural field. The associated micro-fractures around the faults greatly improve the permeability of the reservoir and have a great significance for developing the gas reservoir with low permeability. Production capacity analysis of relevant gas producers indicates that 80% of the productive gas producers are located in the faulted-block trap, showing the obvious effect of faulted-block on gas/oil accumulation.

78249237581	Potential and early opportunity-analysis on CO2 geo-sequestration in China	CO2 geo-sequestration, as an effective method to reduce Green House Gas emissions, is a front subject in China. In order to identify the potentials of implementing large scale CO2 sequestration projects according to China's current development tendency, this paper analyzes the general formation conditions of the main oilfields in China, which are manifested in complex formation structure with strong heterogeneity, low or ultra-low permeability and low porosity. In China, the main application mode of CO2 sequestration, also the most profitable method, is to inject CO2 into oil and gas reservoirs to enhance recovery. Meanwhile, 60%-80% of the injected CO2 could be stored into the formation. Jilin oilfield in northeast of China, the dominant test field for CO2 sequestration, has been listed into the National Key Program in 2006. Pilot tests reveals formation here is featured with well developed sand body, good connectivity, well defined cap rock, undeveloped fractures, and independent hydro-geological system, which contribute to a considerable and secured storage for CO2. Though still on the initial stage, studies here would shed light on the further researches in China. Some unique advantages of conducting CO2 sequestration projects in China have been summarized and analyzed in this work too. Most of the new-found oil and gas reservoirs belong to low-permeability reservoirs, wherein CO2 flooding shows its superiority over conventional water injection in tight formations. Moreover, both main CO2 sources (coal-fired plants & power plants) and injecting sites(low-permeability reservoirs) locate in northern and eastern China, which would meet the demand of CO2-EOR and shorten the distance of transportation to reduce corrosion risk and operation cost. Although being not regulated by Kyoto Protocol, positive measures of CO2 sequestration in China possesses a significant and far-reaching meaning to releive the pressure of global environment. © 2010, European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.

78649281955	A new model for predicting liquid loading in low energy wells	Aiming at the shortcoming of the carrying fluid model for low energy gas wells, and combimng liquid loading experiment, the mechanism of fluid-carrying in gas wells is discovered in a certain extent by analysis of bubble model common used recently. It showed that Coleman ' s model neglected the influence of deformation of the bubble to critical flow rate of fluid-carrying, so that the calculated critical flow rate is greater than actual one; and Li Min's model didn' t take the energy loss due to turning upside down of the elliptical bubbles in wellbore into account, so that the calculated critical flow rate is a little bit too small. The results of experiment and analysis showed the measured critical flow rate of fluid-carrying was between those calculated from Coleman's model and Li Min s, and the energy loss caused by turning upside down can counteract the additional energy created by deformation of the bubble. Based on the basic principle of carrying fluid model and combining the result of liquid loading experiment, a new carrying fluid model for low pressure gas wells and a new formula are proposed, a modification factor is added in the new model to express the influence of turning upside down of the bubbles, and so description of real situation becomes better. Comparing the result calculated from the new model with Coleman's experiment data, the new model has less error, more accuracy in prediction and better application result.

78650032026	Gas and water pay recognition of water-producing reservoir with low permeability and resistivity: A case from the Xujiahe Formation in Guang'an gasfield of Sichuan basin, southwestern China	The fourth and sixth members of upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation develop structural, structural-lithological and lithological reservoirs with characteristics of low porosity, permeability, resistivity and high irreducible water saturation in Guang'an gasfield of Sichuan basin, southwestern China. In space, relationship of the reservoir porosity and permeability varies greatly, and the reservoir gas and water distribution is complex, resulting in difficulty in gas and water pay recognition. Based on the core calibration of logging data, relationships among lithology, logging characterization, petrophysical property and gas-bearing capacity of the target zones were explored. It can be concluded that the reservoirs are made up of fine, medium-and coarse-grained sandstones with characteristics of low values of gamma ray, density and resistivity and high values of sonic, while the porosity and permeability show no correlation with gas-bearing capacity. The porosity and permeability model were established by considering the sixth and fourth members of Xujiahe Formation separately and subdividing the study area into four blocks, which improves precision of the porosity and permeability interpretation. On the recognition that different gas reservoir types have different gas and water distributions, three methods of high definition induction logging, nuclear-magnetic resonance logging and comprehensive discrimination were jointly applied to distinguish gas and water pays, which increases the accuracy of gas and water pay identification. The application of these methods in the Guang'an gasfield show they are suitable for gas and water pay recognition of structural and structural-lithological reservoirs, whereas not feasible for lithological reservoirs with low structural magnitude whose water saturations of gas pay are transitional with those of water and gas-and water-bearing pay due to incomplete separation of gas and water.

78751495174	Modeling of sulfur deposition damage in the presence of irreducible water	With the decreasing of pressure and temperature, elemental sulfur may deposit and cause a decline in reservoir permeability. In this work, an elemental sulfur agglomeration mechanism and the effect of irreducible water on agglomeration were analyzed. A prediction model on sulfur deposition in the presence of irreducible water was proposed based on non-Darcy flow. The result shows that sulfur deposition damage mainly occurs near the wellbore, and irreducible water has a direct effect on sulfur particle agglomeration. When reservoir pressure is lower than the saturation pressure of elemental sulfur, precipitated sulfur block pore and decrease permeability, higher saturation degree of irreducible water lead to plug seriously, gas limited production time become shorter when non-Darcy flow is considered and productivity decline velocity become more quickly.

The experimental results indicated that when the method with variable internal pressure but constant peripheral pressure was used, the outcome went against common knowledge due to the zero drift of both the pressure sensor and the differential pressure sensor caused by broad variations in fluid pressure. So the method with constant internal pressure but variable peripheral pressure was adopted in the test, and the outcome demonstrated that the process of rock deformation could be divided into two phases, namely the microcrack closure phase and the rock compression phase. During the first phase, the permeability reduced dramatically by 20% due to the closure of microcracks, while in the second phase, the permeability decreased slowly by 5% with the increase of peripheral pressure that keeps compressing rocks. Therefore, the paper proposed that the stress-dependent sensitivity of ultra-low permeability reservoirs under the in-situ stress was weak and its effect on the productivity of low permeability reservoirs was negligible.

Formula calculation of the effective flooding permeability in two-phase flow of threshold pressure gradient is derived by using the method of piston drive, and proportion of flowing sublayers is determined. With net thickness and permeability of each sublayer that is weighted on average, each sublayer and oil well deliverability are calculated, then actual threshold geologic reserve is determined finally. Conventional development indexes, such as degree of reserve recovery etc, are amended by using threshold geologic reserve.

84862635760	The effect of stress and pore pressure on formation permeability of ultra-low-permeability reservoir	Low-permeability reservoirs have attracted increased attention from most oil companies due to increased demand and limited reserves in conventional reservoirs. Most scholars agree that worldwide hydrocarbon production decline from conventional reservoirs will be compensated for by the development of low-permeability reservoirs to satisfy growing demand. During the production life cycle of a low- permeability reservoir, permeability at any given location may change in response to the change of stress due to depressurization. Waterflooding is an important method used to develop low-permeability oil reservoirs. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether and how a stress state change can affect formation permeability. However, it is seldom seen the relevant research and report. This article presents a laboratory procedure to simulate the stress state change of ultra-low-permeability formation during injection and production applying cores from Changqing oilfield and evaluate the effect of stress on formation permeability under reservoir conditions using brine as the fluid medium. This work focuses on how formation permeability changes with stress change during injection and drawdown and discusses the difference in permeability change between injection and production. The analysis is not only on the basis of selecting zero pore pressure but also in situ pressure as the starting point; that is, a reference point. The results indicate that reservoir permeability changes during both drawdown and injection are caused by stress variation. Microcracks are the main factor resulting in this permeability change. This experimental method simulated formation stress state and flow behavior as truly. The results are meaningful for analyzing oil well production and reservoir development for ultra-low-permeability reservoir. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The diameter of some parts of the wellbore becomes smaller when there are plenty of precipitated sulfurs on the inner side of the wall. The mechanism of sulfuric glomeration and adsorption were investigated and the tendency of sulfuric distribution was analyzed in wellbore, critical gas velocity and sulfur particle mechanical models were established. The results indicate that liquid bridge force, which is produced by the effects of water film between sulfur particles, is the main cause of sulfur glomeration. At the beginning of sour gas reservoir development, when borehole pressure is lower than saturation pressure, the distribution of precipitated sulfur and critical velocity of carrying sulfur are increasing from bottom hole to well head. Sulfur particles are difficultly carried when liquid bridge force is formed. Critical velocity goes up with precipitated sulfur diameter increasing. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The sedimentary micro-facies and the diageneses of Q5 are studied based on the data analysis of well logging, ordinary thin-section, cast thin-section, reservoir physical property, mercury-injection measurement, scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and grain size measurement. It is held that Q5 is the deposit of sandy meandering rivers formed under the condition of dry climate, which shows the characteristics of coarse grain, low - moderate compositional and textural maturity, developed large-scale cross bedding and normal graded bed sequence. The distribution of sandbodies is controlled by the point bar microfacies of the meandering rivers. The sandstones principally undergone the diageneses of compaction, cementation and dissolution. Constructive diagenesis include: the filming cementation of chlorite restraining the secondary enlargement of quartz or feldspar and contributing to the reservation of primary intergrain pores, the contraction of illite-smectites mixed layer forming microfractures, and debris, feldspar and biotite dissolving. The diagenetic stage can be classified as from B period of early diagenesis to A period of middle diagenesis. Five diagenesis facies are discerned: the intergranular pore facies of chlorite - quartz cementation, the dissolution pore-intergranular pore facies of chlorite - quartz cementation, the microfracture facies of illite - smectite mixed layer cementation, the dissolution pore facies of siliceous cementation and the micropore facies of dense compaction. Of these, the first three are most favorable diagenesis facies. There are mainly intergrain pore and moderate - fine throat in reservoir. And there are four kinds of pore - throat assemblages: moderate pore - moderate throat, moderate pore - fine throat, low pore - moderate thoat and low pore - fine throat. The reservoir is of moderate - low porosity and moderate - super-low permeability. The microfracture improves the permeability of the reservoir.

84870214047	A new model for the accurate prediction of liquid loading in low-pressure gas wells	The critical gas velocity and flow rate for unloading liquids from a gas well has been the subject of much interest, especially in old gas-producing fields with declining reservoir pressures. For low- pressure gas wells, Turner's model (also called Coleman's model) is judged as more suitable for predicting liquid loading in gas wells. However, field practice proves that there are still a number of low-pressure gas wells producing without loadup when the production rate is lower than Turner's minimum production rate. On the basis of experimental results, a new approach for calculating the critical gas-flow rate is introduced in this paper, which adopts Li's basic concepts, while taking into account the impact of the changes of gas-lifting efficiency caused by the rollover of droplets in the process of rising. A dimensionless parameter, loss factor S, is introduced in the new model to characterize the extent of the loss of gas energy. Well data from Coleman's paper (Coleman et al. 1991b) were used in this paper for validation of the new model. The predicted results from the new model are better than those from Li's model, and even better than Turner's model. The new model is simple and can be evaluated at the wellhead when the pressure is less than 500 psia and the liquid/gas ratios range from 1 to 130 bbl/ MMscf, which is suggested by Turner et al.

84873893550	Distribution of sulfur deposition near a wellbore in a sour gas reservoir	Elemental sulfur precipitates from sour gas when reservoir pressure and temperature decrease. Sulfur deposition in a formation may significantly reduce the inflow performance of sour gas wells. This paper develops a micro-mechanical migration model and experiments which describe the law of sulfur precipitation, plugging and distribution near a wellbore. Based on the analysis of the sulfur deposition law and micro-mechanical migration theory, elemental sulfur mechanical models in pores are presented. The critical velocity of sulfur is calculated and the rule of precipitated sulfur distribution near a wellbore is deduced. Reservoir cores and supersaturated sour gas are utilized to observe sulfur precipitation and plugging in sulfur damage experiments, and the main influential factor is analysed. According to the models and experimental results, precipitated sulfur can decrease reservoir permeability. The liquid bridge force is the most important factor to affect reservoir permeability due to sulfur deposition. Precipitated sulfur cannot be carried away from pores if the liquid bridge force is considered; the critical velocity increases as the diameter of the sulfur particles increases, which may cause serious formation damage. Moreover, it can be seen from the results that the biggest volume of sulfur deposition does not occur at the bottom but near the bottom of a borehole. These results can be used to describe the profile of dynamic sulfur deposition and help a reservoir engineer to develop a plan for removing the sulfur near a wellbore. © 2013 Sinopec Geophysical Research Institute.

A task lies in accurately predicting the wellbore pressure drop because multi-phase flow prevails in the wellbore as well as in gas and oil transmission and distribution pipelines. Physical phenomena, such as turbulence, flow regime transitions, and thermodynamic phase changes with pressure and temperature occur in the wellbore. When gas production exceeds fluid production. the liquid phase will disperse in the gas phase as liquid droplets and will be carried to the surface by the gas phase. Only when the gas production rate passes a critical fluid-carrying flow rate will all liquid be carried out.

84876370607	Improving decline-curve analysis of low-permeability gas wells using type curves	The authors present a rigorous method to analyze and interpret production rate and pressure data of low-permeability gas wells using type curves. The method is based on the type curve analysis method presented by Blasingame et al. (1991), but imports the wellbore storage coefficient, which influences the flow behavior of low-permeability gas wells significantly, for the first time. This work fills a significant void in the inventory of decline curve type curves, and the method is applicable to production analysis for cases taken from low-permeability gas wells.

84879703763	A new well pattern for enhancing waterflood performance of ultra-low permeability reservoir in Changqing oilfield	Because the development of ultra-low permeability reservoir is relative to fracture system, suitable well pattern arrangement is very significant for effective flooding management. There were three kinds of well pattern used to waterflood in Changqing oilfield: square inverted nine-spot, rhombus inverted nine-spot and rectangular five-spot pattern, according to the degree of fracture growth. In view of the defects of these well patterns in the development of ultra-low permeability reservoirs, a new well spacing concept is developed. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the adaptability and strong points of this new well pattern. For this well pattern, on the one hand, the distance between producers and injectors along the fracture direction is widened and thus massive fracturing can be conducted to enhance oil productivity and water injection, and on the other hand, a high producer/injector ratio ensures high oil recovery rate in early stage. Besides, this new well pattern has a great ability of adjustment. Field application showed a remarkably well producing performance. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84879717169	Experimental study on stress sensitivity of ultra-low permeability sandstones	Ultra-low permeability rocks have plenty of microfractures. The stress-dependent permeability has a significant impact on the seepage. Previous studies are mainly on the permeability variation with stress in low permeability reservoir. But few are involved in ultralow permeability cores. In this paper, the experiment of stress sensitive ultralow permeability cores which are fabricated (both matrix cores and microfracture cores) is conducted. The experimental results shows that the permeability of microfracture low permeability cores which are fabricated increases greatly while the porosity of low permeability cores is little affected. This indicates that the fabricated microfracture cores are in line with that of the real situations of fracture media reservoir. By comparison, the permeability stress sensitive hysteresis degree of microfracture cores is not apparent and the permeability recovery degree is high in the unloading cycle. This study is of great benefit to reveals the stress sensitivity features of ultralow permeability reservoir. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

We also investigated the effects of slippage on laboratory results and gas well production. Our study shows the permeability lose rate caused by the slippage effect and medium deformation is larger than that only caused by medium deformation, comparing the stress sensitivity experimental results. From results of hundreds of experiments, the relationship between slip factor and Klingenberg-corrected permeability was set up by regression, in addition, the theoretical type-curve depicting the effect of slippage on production was plotted with consideration of both permeability and pressure of gas reservoirs. This type-curve is valuable for engineering application to judge the effecting degree of slippage effect on production. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84883404293	Hydraulic fracture initiation while staged fracturing for horizontal wells	Hydraulic fracturing is recognized as a successful stimulation technique for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery from unconventional tight reservoirs. Technological advancement in directional drilling has led the petroleum industry to drill arbitrarily oriented wellbores for exploitation of reservoirs, which otherwise could not be economically produced. Prediction of fracture initiation from such wellbores is therefore essential for petroleum industries to undertake efficient hydraulic fracturing stimulation tasks. In a hydraulic fracturing process, fluid is injected under pressure through the wellbore in order to overcome native stresses and to cause failure of rocks, thus creating fractures in a reservoir. These fractures create a passage through which hydrocarbon flows into the well from the shale formation. Based on the superposition principle and elasticity theory, a total stress field mathematical model while staged fracturing for horizontal well is abstractly presented in this paper, considering systematically influencing factors such as wellbore pressure, in-situ stress distribution, seepage effect of fracturing fluid, and induced stress produced by hydraulic fracture. The law of initial and subsequent fractures initiation is studied. The results show that the initial fracture initiation is affected by the wellbore azimuth angle, and it is easy for transverse fractures to form when the minimum in-situ horizontal stress along the wellbore direction. The stress distribution around wellbore is influenced by induced stress field, and when the initial fracture height is constant, the effect decreases gradually along wellbore direction until the combined stress field tends to the in-situ stress field. In a certain position from the initial fracture, the bigger the fracture height, the greater the induced stress, and in particular, the influence on induced stress along the wellbore direction is more obvious. Induced stress can increase subsequent fractures initiation pressure, whose level will reach 30% and increase as the fracture height increases. When fracture height is constant, the increase level of initiation pressure decreases rapidly with the increase of fracture spacing. There is well coincidence between computational solution and measured result. Results from the analytical and numerical models used in this study are interpreted with a particular effort to enlighten the causes of abnormally high treating pressures during hydraulic fracture treatments, as well as engineers study recovery techniques.

84884928476	Feasibility analysis of fractured-horizontal well development in Huaqing ultra-low permeability reservoir	Fractured-horizontal well can effectively reduce the percolation resistance near wellbore, improve the fluid mobility and enhance the production. However, in Chang 6 ultra-low permeability reservoir, BaiBao block, HuaQing oilfield, the efficiency of fractured-horizontal well is highly poor due to the production swiftly down and water cut sharply up. For studying the unsatisfying oil development by fractured-horizontal well in HuaQing oil field, the evaluation of reservoir properties and the option of stratum for fractured-horizontal well application have been performed based on the practical geological model of BaiBao block in HuaQing oil field.

84884929957	Principles of unsaturated flow in tight gas reservoirs	The future of the energy sector in the coming years is expected to be significantly affected by unconventional gas resources. Flow through porous media has many applications in the chemical, petroleum, gas, and pulp and paper industries, as well as in soil remediation and material characterization. In petroleum and natural gas production, flow through porous media has significance in the production of gas and/or oil. There are many characteristics of tight reservoir rock resulting in high and complex water saturation such as tiny pore throat, poor sorting, high displacement pressure, and so on. The one hand, the gas seepage is affected by the slippage effect, resulting in the abnormal gas relative permeability. On the other hand, the residual water of the tight core is controlled by displacement pressure. This study is directly related to gas reservoir engineering and is specifically focused to obtain fundamental information for two phase flow through low permeability porous media (Tight Sand Gas). © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884938067	Decline curves of a vertical well in stress-sensitive reservoir	Stress-sensitivity effects have been recognized to have impact on the pressure/rate transient behavior of wells in several reservoirs. Although the effects of stress-sensitivity have been considered in well testing theory in the past thirty years, little has been done to determine their influence on rate decline behavior. This paper presents a single phase flow model considering stress-sensitive formation permeability to investigate the characteristic of production rate decline of a vertical well. The stress-sensitive permeability is considered as an exponential form. The permeability changes with pressure drop are described by a permeability modulus. By introducing two pseudo functions, the equations of the mathematical model are linearized and approximate semi-analytical solutions are obtained. The analytical solutions are carefully verified through numerical simulation. Two sets of new decline type curves are diagramed on a log-log plot for constant rate case and constant bottomhole pressure case respectively. The influence of stress-sensitive permeability on decline curves are analyzed and compared. From this work, we recognized that the rate decline characteristics of stress-sensitive reservoir under constant rate and constant bottomhole producing condition are different. New analysis method should be developed to analyze field variable rate/variable pressure drop data. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84884964713	Study on stress sensitivity in microfracture ultra-low permeability reservoir	The stress-dependent permeability of ultra-low permeability rocks has a significant impact on the seepage. A number of experimental studies on the variation of permeability with stress change in low permeability reservoir have been done, but few are involved in ultra-low permeability cores. In this study, first, we fabricated the shear-stress microfracture cores and then the stress sensitive experiments were conducted. Second, a fracture deformation model was introduced in order to depict the stress sensitivity features of fracture media theoretically. Finally, a comparison of the theoretical curves with the experimental data had been done. The results show that the fabricated microfracture cores can be used in the permeability stress sensitive experiments. The permeability stress sensitive hysteresis of the microfracture cores is not obvious and the recovery degree of stress sensitive hysteresis is high in the unloading cycle for the grains were compacted in the process of shearing. The theoretical curves have the desired behavior which is consistent with the experimental data well. It indicates that the method of fabricating microfractures can similarly reveal the stress sensitivity features of the real microfracture ultralow permeability reservoir.

84890167319	Division of pressure system and analysis of controlling reason for water-driven gas reservoir of the Guang'an district	Xujiahe gas reservoir in Guang'an area is characterized by complex relationship between gas and water, and low natural productivity of gas wells, so diving pressure system gets difficult. From analysis of the production performance and percolating characteristics of low permeability water-driven gas reservoir, the characteristics of reservoir, pressure-elevation and pressure distribution of low permeability gas reservoir were studied. By way of the analysis of characteristics and mechanism of yielded formation water during the exploitation of Xujiahe gas reservoir in this paper, the reservoir is characterized by normal distribution of gas and water, namely the gas located above the water; water type is disserted; As the decreasing of pore throat radius, capillary force, water saturation and the high of gas/water transition zone increase; gas and water reside in the same layer by the action of capillary force and gas/water transition zone exists; the reservoir heterogeneous conditions are the reasons of controlling reason and pressure system division. With real cases, it is demonstrated the analysis methods have important significance for the development of the water-driven gas reservoirs with low permeability.

84891636272	Influence of perforating parameters on the productivity of fractured well in tight reservoir	Hydraulic fracturing is an effective measure to increase oil production for the development of low permeability reservoir. The selection of perforating parameters has a direct effect on the fracture expansion, formation fracture cracking pressure and even the implementation success of fracturing in that the fracturing processing fluid and artificial fracture all need to pass through the extension of perforation. In field application, the selection of perforating parameters is usually determined base on experience without combining with the actual data of the hydraulic fracturing wells. This work focuses on analyzing the influence of perforating parameters on the productivity of fractured well based on an established productivity prediction model through analytical method. Results show that, take a specific area of Changqing oil field for example, the perforation diameter has little effect on the productivity after fracturing, the other optimized perforating parameters are as follows: the perforation degree 30~40%, perforation density 8~12 perforation per meter, perforation depth 0.2~0.3m. The results are helpful to guide the optimization of perforating parameters in low permeability reservoir. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

The fracturing treatment in field lacks relevant theoretical models for prediction. Therefore, this work focuses on establishing the flowback model of hydraulic fracturing for multilayer fractured wells. Then the wellhead pressure and fluid flowback volume are predicted based on the actual parameters of fracturing treatment in the process of flowback and are compared with the field data of frac fluid flowback. Results show that the wellhead pressure and fluid flowback volume calculated by the model are consistent with the field data. The sand production ratio of the three wells during the flowback process is lower than 1% indicating that the optimized parameters achieve the purpose of flowback operations and reduce the flowback volume of the proppant. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84891653453	Investigation of well patterns of horizontal-vertical wells for the exploitation of tight reservoir	In general, the scale of production, exploitation period and the economic benefits of oil and gas field are, to a large extent, depended on the selection, deployment and adjustment of well patterns, especially for tight reservoir. So far, some problems exist in Changqing low permeability oil field, such as the effective displacement system is not easy to be established, a low utilization efficiency of injection water, low oil production and so on. Therefore, five kinds of different well pattern schemes are designed. Then, the well pattern schemes are optimized through numerical simulation method based on the exploitation index including the daily oil output per well, moisture content and oil recovery. Results show that the well patterns of horizontal-vertical wells have better development efficiency than the well patterns of vertical wells. For the optimized well pattern, when the horizontal segment length of horizontal well is 300m, the optimalizing well spacing is 400m and the optimalizing row spacing is 100~150m. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84891656156	Pressure buildup behavior in deformable medium formation	Based on the fact that formation properties of deep high pressure reservoirs, low permeability tight reservoirs, and naturally fractured reservoirs are trend to be affected by the variation of effective stress, a buildup test model is established for deformable medium reservoir. By defining a pseudo function, the formulations of the model are linearized partially, and numerical method is used to solve the problems. Typical curves of pressure transient tests are obtained and analyzed on double logarithm plots. Both pressure curves and pressure derivative curves of deformable medium formation are significantly different between drawdown and buildup cases. During radial flow period, the pressure derivative curves of drawdown test goes upwards gradually with the duration of production, and the greater is the permeability modulus, the shorter is the distance between the pressure curves and the pressure derivative curves. While as for buildup test, the pressure derivative curves goes downwards gradually with duration of shut-in, and the greater is the permeability modulus, the greater is the distance between the pressure curves and the pressure derivative curves. The difference between pressure drawdown and pressure buildup curves becomes more obvious as production time increasing. Thus, the principle of superposition cannot be used to pressure buildup analysis in deformable formation.

This work focuses on analyzing the influence of fracture parameters on fractured horizontal well productivity in tight gas reservoir through establishing a productivity prediction model of fractured horizontal well, considering the interference between fracture and fracture and the wellbore pressure drop. Results show that the fracture parameters, such as fracture number, fracture interval, fracture conductivity and fracture length, have different influences on the productivity of fractured horizontal well and thus, the effects of fracture parameters should be taken into account when designing the fracturing treatment. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84896033377	Effect of impurities on carbon dioxide flooding in Changqing low permeability reservoir	Carbon dioxide flooding is an effective method that can solve both carbon capture and storage and enhanced oil recovery simultaneously. Because pure carbon dioxide sources are few in number and most are mixed with impurities, the effects of impurities on oil phase and displacement need to be studied. For designing a feasibly economical carbon dioxide flooding in Changqing oil field, in this paper, a carbon dioxide oil system model was built in the experiment and used to study effects of impurities on the pressure-volume-temperature. Slim tube displacement and numerical simulation were combined to determine the minimum miscible pressures (MMP) of different gas contents and to analyze the effects of impurities on the MMP. The long-core tests were conducted to investigate effects of impurities on gas-oil displacement by combining the experimental data matching. The results show that the interfusion of nitrogen and methane takes the disadvantage of oil viscosity reduction and volume expansion. The MMP is increasing along with the increase of mole fraction of nitrogen and methane, but decreasing with the increase of mole fraction of intermediate hydrocarbon components. The intermediate hydrocarbon components can enhance the displacement efficiency. On the contrary, nitrogen and methane reduce the efficiency. © 2014 WIT Press.

Then the experiment of stress sensitivity was conducted with microfracture cores fabricated by Brazil experiment and the features of permeability stress sensitivity were analyzed. Finally, the experimental data were contrasted with the theoretical curves. Results indicate that: (1) The theoretical curves quantitatively reveal the stress sensitivity features and the relationships with the microfracture content and roughness; the curves have the stress sensitivity features of fracture media reservoir. (2) The fabricated microfractures can proximately simulate the real situations of microfracture media reservoir and be used in the experiment. (3) The evaluation of stress-dependent permeability of cores should begin with the in-situ stress, or it would be overestimated; the permeability hysteresis loss of tensile-stress microfracture core is smaller and the permeability recovery degree is high so the permeability stress sensitivity is not strong;(4) The theoretical curve accords with the experimental data well, which indicates that the theoretical model can reveal the stress sensitivity characteristics of ultralow permeability fracture media accurately.

With decreasing pressure and temperature near bore zones, solid elemental sulfur may deposit and block pore. What's worse, it reduces the inflow performance of sour-gas wells. Based on the comprehensive analysis of deposit and block process, solid elemental sulfur motional and mechanical model were established with irreducible water considered. The results indicated that precipitated solid elemental sulfur did not move a long time in pore; they could insuit deposit. Irreducible water plays an important role in sulfur deposition.

84905903796	Overview of research methods of microscopic pore structure with material properties in reservoir rocks	Pore reflects fluid storage capacity of the rock, while the shape and size of the throat, together with the pore throat ratio, control the permeability and fluid reservoir capacity. There are mainly two aspects in microscopic pore structure characteristics evaluation at present: experiment and theoretical modeling. In this paper, several experimental methods and modeling methods that currently exist were compared and analyzed. The analysis shows that in the aspect of experiments, the domestic basic research in the field of three-dimensional pore structure model reconstruction technique is still relatively weak under limited conditions of equipment and technology, while in the aspect of models, the current domestic research is still relatively rare. A conclusion is drawn that the main problems in the study of microscopic pore structure at home are still the degree of improvement in the accuracy of the experiment and the model upgrade. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84908320179	Pressure buildup behavior of vertically fractured wells with stress-sensitive conductivity	This paper presents the results of a study on pressure buildup analysis of a vertically fractured well with the consideration of stress-sensitive permeability and hysteresis effect in fracture. A new function was established to better characterize the variation of fracture permeability on pore pressure, and a mathematical model was derived for the buildup test of fractured wells with stress-sensitive conductivity. Several simulation cases involve various conductive fractures were run to plot pressure buildup type curves under stress damage condition. The influence of stress effect on buildup behavior and the variation of the fracture conductivity are discussed extensively. Results of this investigation demonstrate that for stress-sensitive conductivity fractured wells, a straight line with slope value of 0.25 which defines the bilinear flow regime is still clearly observed on pressure buildup type curves after pressure drops. The stress sensitivity behavior of a producing fractured well could not be determined from a single buildup test. The effect of permeability hysteresis in the fracture has a negligible influence on the pressure buildup curves. From the test data of the bilinear flow, only the conductivity value near the wellbore at shut-in time can be estimated using conventional methods.
