13944271030	Preparation and characterization of alumina coated carbon fiber by sol-gel method	The alumina coatings on the surface of carbon fibers were prepared by the sol-gel method. The dependence of boehmite sol concentration, coating thickness and interlaminar shear strength was studied. The results showed that the alumina coating thickness linearly increased with the rise of boehmite sol concentration. The interlaminar shear strength of samples was increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of coating thickness. When the concentration of sol was 0.27 mol/L, the coating thickness was about 30 nm and the interlaminar shear strength of the epoxy resin matrix composite reached the maximum. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope results indicate that the alumina coating prepared on the surface of carbon fiber is even and complete.

13944271991	Electrochemical determination of alkaline phosphatase in human serum by differential pulse voltammetry	Differential pulse voltammetry(DPV) was applied to the determination of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in human serum with phenyl phosphate as the substrate. Phenyl phosphate can enzymatically be hydrolyzed to produce phenol which is quantified by DPV at +660 mV (vs.Ag/AgCl) in the concentration range of 2.0-100 μmol/L. The standard curve for ALP is linear over the range from 0.06 to 1000 U/L with a relative standard deviation of 3.0%. The conditions for the enzymatic reaction and voltammetric detection were optimized and the kinetic constants were also examined. The human serum samples were tested by this method and the results were in good agreement with those obtained by the routine p-nitrophenyl phosphate spectrophotometric method.

15844426944	Electrochemical studies of the reaction between albumin and amaranth and its analytical application	The interaction of serum albumin with amaranth was studied at the mercury electrode with different electrochemical methods such as cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in this paper. In pH 3.0 Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution, amaranth showed an irreversible voltammetric reductive peak at -0.12 V (vs. SCE). After the addition of human serum albumin (HSA) into the amaranth solution, the reductive peak currents decreased without any shift of the peak potentials. Electrochemical equations suitable for studying the interaction of irreversible electro-active molecules with HSA were proposed. The electrochemical parameters of the interaction system were calculated in the absence and presence of HSA and the results showed that there were no obvious differences in the two sets of parameters. So a bio-supramolecular complex was formed after the reaction of amaranth and HSA, which induced the decrease of the free concentration of amaranth in the reaction solution, and the decrease of the reductive peak current of amaranth. The binding constant and binding ratio were calculated as 8.34 × 10

Before being filled into PBT, nano-silica was subjected to graft modification. The graft polymerization of PBT prepolymer was performed onto the surface of the nano-particles and the grafted nano-silica was characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, sedimentation experiment, transmission electron microscopy, and atomic force microscope. It demonstrated that there was a chemical linkage between the nano-silica and the grafting prepolymer. Vacuum played an important role in determining the grafting amount and the length of the grafting chains. The lower the vacuum, the longer the grafting chains, and thus, the more the weight loss. The grafted nano-particles had a typical core-shell structure. The grafted version had better compatibility with the resin matrix compared to the original version and could disperse homogeneously in PBT and no aggregation occurred. Hence, interfacial adhesion between nano-silica and PBT was largely enhanced. The properties of the resultant nanocomposite including thermal stability, tensile strength, and notched impact strength were greatly improved. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

19944406435	Linear sweep voltammetric determination of heparin based on its interaction with neutral red	In this article the interaction of neutral red with heparin was characterized by linear sweep voltammetry on the hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) and further used for the determination of heparin. In pH 1.5 Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution, neutral red (NR) has a well-defined second-order derivative linear sweep voltammetric reductive wave at -0.24 V (vs. SCE). After the addition of heparin into the NR solution, the reductive peak current decreases without the movement of the peak potential and the appearances of new peaks in the scanning potential range. Based on the decrease of the reductive peak current, a new voltammetric method for the determination of heparin is established. The conditions for the interaction and the electrochemical detection are optimized, and the interference substances for detection are investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the decrease of reductive peak current of NR is proportional to heparin concentration in the range of 2.0-10.0 mg/L with the linear regression equation as Δip″(nA) = -172.03 + 71.49C (mg/L), (n = 9, γ = 0.997) and the detection limit is 1.34 mg/L. This new method is further successfully applied to the determination of heparin in heparin injection samples with satisfactory results. The binding ratio and binding mechanism of NR with heparin are also discussed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis, Inc.

The oxidation of BBTPO in both AEO9 and TX-10 inverted micelles produced significantly improved intensity and efficiency of the chemiluminescence relative to that in normal organic media. It was found that in AEO9 and TX-10 inverted micellar media the enhancement of chemiluminescence was mainly due to the improvement of the reaction excitation efficiencies, but only slightly contributed by the increase of the fluorescence efficiency.

31544452825	Self-assembled nanodisks with targetlike multirings aggregated at the air-water interface	In this communication, we report the self-assembly of zirconia by mixing its precursor with another solution containing surfactant as well as gelatin. The resulting zirconia product consists of many disks with a range of diameter from ∼100 nm to ∼2 μm. These disks can be assembled inside aqueous systems. Meanwhile the disks rise gradually and eventually form a visible film at the air-water interface. Remarkably, the structure of zirconia disks templated by surfactant has been found to be targetlike multirings with a d spacing of ∼3.3 nm. We propose that a successful multirings self-assembly depends on two different template-functions from the same surfactant, excellent tenacity of the zirconia layers and the strong ability of the gelatin to stabilize and disperse the disks.

The results showed that the highly-ordered mesoporous molecular sieves were synthesized, and the template agent was efficiently removed after calcination at 550°C. After Pt-loading the ordering of mesoporous molecular sieves was decreased, however, the mesoporous structure was preserved. The results of benzene hydrogenation indicated that the mesoporous molecular sieve without Ni did not have any catalytic activity, but the Pt-loading mesoporous molecular sieves had catalytic activity. In addition, the Ni-containing mesoporous molecular sieve itself was catalytically active for benzene hydrogenation. After loading Pt on the Ni-containing mesoporous molecular sieve, the catalytic activity for benzene hydrogenation was enhanced. The selectivity of cyclohexane for all samples was nearly 100%.

0033665849	New approach to the determination of Mark-Houwink parameters	A new approach to determining Mark-Houwink (MH) parameters accurately and conveniently is proposed in this paper. With this method, the MH parameters of a polymer system can be determined by firstly measuring the average retention volumes of several polydisperse samples of the polymer system with a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and their intrinsic viscosities with a Ubbelohde viscometer, then finding a nonlinear least square function according to the least square principle, and finally deciding the global optimum values of the MH parameters accurately and conveniently by grid search algorithm. With this method, the hard work and possible errors due to fractionation of the polydisperse sample of the polymer can be avoided. In addition, this method has two important advantages over existing analogous methods: one is that, this method uses a GPC chromatogram of a polydisperse sample of the polymer system as a whole instead of dividing it into sections and treating each of the sections as a monodisperse sample, thus, the errors arising from the instrumental spreading effect can be avoided; the other is that, the grid search algorithm is used in this method to find the global optimum values of MH parameters in a short time, thus, the errors and the trouble resulting from the application of a nonlinear regression algorithm can be avoided as well. The polymer systems of polystyrene (PS) in toluene at 25 °C and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) in benzene at 25 °C have been selected to demonstrate the applicability of this method. In addition, the computer program can be used to all the cases of determining the MH parameters by this method.

In the existing methods, the determination of MH parameters involves the use of linear or nonlinear regression. In the cases of using the algorithm of grid search to solve the linear regression problem for the determination of MH parameters, the values of the MH parameters obtained by the grid search method are the same as those obtained by the linear regression method, while in the cases when some nonlinear regression methods have to be used in the existing methods, using the algorithm of grid search can determine the parameters much more easily and accurately than using any nonlinear regression methods. In addition, the grid search method is very easy to understand and execute, and the accuracy of the results can be exhibited by the value of the least-square function.

For the membrane anodized in vacuum, we clearly observed fairly large amount of evolved oxygen and some pores with smaller branch pores. Oxygen usually evolves at the interfaces of electrolyte and the Al oxide layer or inner walls of pores.

34249056136	Crystallization of binary carboxylic acids characterized with streaming potential measurement	The streaming potential of supersaturated solution of binary carboxylic acids, which have even carbon atoms, was determined to characterize crystallization under different temperatures. The value of the streaming potential was related to the type and solubility of the acids and the starting temperature of crystallization, and was easily influenced by the pressure difference of the liquid or the rate of temperature decline. When the temperature was declined to the point where a crystal nucleus appeared, the streaming potential reached the minimum. Thereafter, as the temperature was sequentially lowered, some minicrystals grew, and the streaming potential presented an ascendant tendency. The higher the starting temperature of the acids saturated solution, the higher is the temperature corresponding to the streaming potential minimum. The less the carbon atoms in the acids and the greater the solubility of the acids are, the higher is the temperature of the streaming potential minimum. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The influence of varying the initial temperature and solution acidity on the ν-t curves were investigated. The results showed that: saturated solutions of L-Glu with relatively high acidity (pH < 3.5) had a distinct nucleating ability at an initial temperature of 15°C; solutions with an initial temperature of 25°C showed competitive nucleating ability at or near the acidity of the isoelectric point; solutions with an initial temperature of 30°C showed a certain nucleating ability which depended on the acidity. Saturated solutions of L-Glu with pH=2.5 and pH=3.5 could form crystal nuclei only when the initial temperature was 15°C; a solution with acidity pH=3.0 could efficiently form crystal nuclei at initial temperatures of 25°C and 30°C.

Based on the structural and morphological variation of the catalysts during the reaction, a catalytic mechanism on thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate catalyzed by cobalt oxalate is proposed. We believe that it is the " self-crushing and self-distributed" occurred within the reaction that really works for the improvement of the overall catalytic activities. In this process, both catalysts and reactants have been crashed and distributed uniformly in an automatic way. This work provides an in-depth insight into the thermal decomposition mechanism of AP as catalyzed by oxalates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

41849129540	The theoretical study on anionic polymerization mechanism of maleimide: Chain propagation by p-π conjugation process	A complete research on the mechanism of the anionic polymerization of maleimide was performed, not only including the chain initiation, but the propagation as well. The density functional theory method is employed to investigate the reaction pathway using 6-311+G* basis set, and the Onsager model is also applied to imitate the effect of solvent on the structures and thermodynamic functions of the key steps. It is found that the initiation starts with a nucleophilic reaction, in which the key transition state shows a π-complex structure. In contrast, the calculated chain propagation (both dimer and trimer process) employs a p-π conjugation chain propagation mechanism (p-π CCPM), characterized by the formation of p-π conjugation orbital between the chain terminal C atom and monomer C=C double bond. This mechanism is in good agreement with the frontier molecular theory and the principle of conservation of molecular orbital symmetry. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

46749128173	Hexa-μ2-bromido-μ4-oxo-tetra-kis[(nicotine)copper(II)]	In the title compound, hexa-2-bromido-4-oxo-tetra-kis{[3-(1-methyl-2- pyrrolidin-yl)pyridine-N]copper(II)}, [Cu4Br6O(C10H14N2)4], the four Cu atoms are tetra-hedrally arranged around the O atom at the cluster center. The Cu and coordinated N atoms lie along directions which correspond to four of the eight threefold axial directions of a regular octa-hedron. Each Cu atom lies at the center of a trigonal bipyramid, with the O atom and the pyridine N atom of a nicotine ligand in the axial positions and three Br atoms in the equatorial positions. Average bond distances are: Cu - N = 1.979 (8), Cu - O = 1.931 (6), Cu - Br = 2.514 (14) and Cu⋯Cu = 3.154 (6) ÅÅ. The configuration of the nicotine ligands is that of the trans diastereomer. In addition, the crystal structure contains five intra-molecular C - H⋯Br hydrogen bonds, which determine (or support) the orientation of the nicotine mol-ecules relative to their three equatorial Br atoms. One of the nicotine mol-ecules has two C - H⋯Br contacts, while the other three nicotine mol-ecules show only one C - H⋯Br bond each. Two other inter-molecular C - H⋯Br hydrogen bonds connect the complex mol-ecules, forming ribbons which extend in the b- and c-axis directions. © 2008.

53049090186	Determination of the degradation products of selected sulfonated phenylazonaphthol dyes treated by white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus by capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry	The removal of water-soluble sulphonated phenylazonaphthol dye effluents generated by textile industries is an important issue in wastewater treatment. Microbial treatment of environmental pollutants including dyes, with white rot fungi has received wide attention as a potential alternative for conventional methods in wastewater treatment. Three sulphonated phenylazonaphthol dyes with similar molecular structures Acid Orange 7, Acid Orange 8 and Mordant Violet 5 were selected and degraded by the white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus. Chemical instrumental analysis methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (CE-ESI-MS) were used to identify the degraded dyes. Mordant Violet 5 had two degradation pathways when degraded by P. ostreatus. The first degradation pathway for Mordant Violet 5 was for trans structure and the cis-Mordant Violet 5 followed the second pathway. Acid Orange 8 and Acid Orange 7 had the same degradation mechanism as the first degradation mechanism for Mordant Violet 5, that is cleavage of azo bond at the naphthalene ring side where benzenesulfonic acid and 1,2-naphthoquinone are formed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

56349151429	Formation mechanism of porous anodic alumina based on the barrier anodic alumina	The anodizing behaviors of aluminum in three kinds of electrolytes were investigated to understand the nature of porous anodic alumina (PAA) growth. The formation reason of the regular columnar channels and irregular pores was analyzed by SEM images and V-t curves. The membranes formed during the initial stage of anodization have two layers, i.e. anion contaminated alumina (ACA) and barrier anodic alumina (BAA) owing to the effect of anions in electrolyte. The avalanche electronic current gave rise to the evolution of oxygen in the ACA/BAA interface. The formation of regular columnar channels in PAA is ascribed to the oxygen evolution. The acidic dissolution only leads to the formation of the irregular pores on the ACA surface. The duration of oxygen evolution decreased with a decrease in concentration of phosphoric acid in the electrolyte. Once oxygen evolution stopped, porous channels were sealed by the new growing alumina, and then the PAA membranes became BAA membranes.

Nanoscale titania was modified with stearic acid at different temperatures. The samples were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), thermogravimetry(TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) and transmission electron microscopye(TEM). The results show that stearic acid is bound on the surface of nanoscale titania by bidentate structure, and even monolayer coverage is obtained. With modification temperature increasing, the crystallite size of nanoscale titania increase, the mass fraction of chemisorbed stearic acid on the surface of nanoscale titania decrease, and the thickness of stearic acid layer changes from 1nm to 2-3nm.The modification temperature has little effect on interactions between stearic acid and titania.

The comparisons between the calculated and experimental results covering molecular structures, assignments of fundamental vibrational modes and thermodynamic properties were investigated. The optimized molecular geometries have been compared with the experimental data obtained from XRD data, which indicates that the theoretical results agree well with the corresponding experimental values. For the three compounds, comparisons and assignments of the vibrational frequencies indicate that the calculated frequencies are close to the experimental data, and the IR spectra are comparable with some slight differences, whereas the Raman spectra are different clearly and the strongest Raman scattering actives are relative tightly to the molecular conjugative moieties linked through their Schiff base imines.

67649491262	Studies on the possibility of recycling microencapsulated disperse dye-bath effluents	The volume of water consumed by human beings has increased dramatically in recent years while water supply has remained constant; both demographic growth and the expansion of industrial activity require more water consumption. The textile industry is undoubtedly one of the most pressured industries that need water intensively. Efficient use of water tends to be a crucial subject for the dyeing industry. In this study, melamine resin microcapsules containing pure disperse dyes were prepared by in situ polymerization. The microcapsules were characterized on the basis of structure, morphologies, mean particle size, and size distribution. The dyeing behaviors of microencapsulated disperse dyes (MDDs) were evaluated on polyester fabrics in the absence of auxiliaries. Its effluent can be reused several times after being simply filtered and can be used as solvent for PET fabric scouring. The treated fabrics exhibited satisfactory levelness and fastness properties. MDDs can be used in dyeing PET, without using surfactants, and the effluents can be recycled, and reused. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The obtained nanocrystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The results indicate that modulating the adding ways of water has a significant effect on the shape of the obtained nanocrystals. The addition of small quantity of water can increase the growth rate of crystals and leads to the formation of different shapes. The resulting shapes of the novel structures are diverse, including spheres, cones, and teardrops, all of which are obtained without any additional surfactants.

The comparisons and assignments of the vibrational frequencies indicate that the experimental spectra also coincide satisfactorily with those of theoretically simulated spectrograms except the hydrogen-bond coupling infrared vibrations, and compounds can be distinguished by the IR and Raman spectra due to the differences of the hydroxyl-substituted positions and molecular packing, and the strong Raman scattering activities of the compounds are tightly relative to the molecular conjugative moieties linked through the Schiff base imines.

The results indicated that both CTAB and SDS had good extraction ability, and at the dosage of 0.2 g/g DS (dry solid), the amounts of the extracted EPS were 154.7 mg/g VSS and 77.6 mg/g VSS, respectively. SDS extracted EPS by its solubilization property, while CTAB extracted EPS by the synergistic effect of solubilization property, replacement of metal cation from activated sludge and release of intracellular materials. The dewatering performances of activated sludge conditioned with CTAB and SDS were also investigated. Capillary suction time (CST), water content in sludge cake and bound water were used to evaluate the sludge dewatering behaviours. The results showed that, compared with commercial cationic polyelectrolyte, CPAM, CTAB and SDS could significantly reduce the water content in sludge cake and bound water. However, SDS did not help in improving the filtration performance in the whole dosage range. For CTAB, only when the dosage was above 0.1 g/g DS, the filtration rate increased due to the reaggregation of dispersed sludge flocs. The dewatering performances of activated sludge conditioned with CTAB and SDS were dependent on detaching and dissolving of EPS from activated sludge, which resulted in the changes in sludge floc structure. © 2010 The Society of Chemical Engineers, Japan.

The inter-lamellar distance was observed to be dependent strongly on the stirring situation during the polymerization: an average distance of 3.4 nm is favorable for samples with and without stirring during the preparation, while a shorter one of 1.4 nm is preferable when the system was stirred only during the period of the addition of ammonium persulfate (APS). Interestingly, all UV-vis, XPS, TGA and elemental analysis experiments demonstrate clearly that the PANIs prepared in this way were in partially doped states, although all these reactions were carried out at non-acidic conditions. Such phenomenon can be attributed to the doping process induced by dodecyl sulfuric acid, which was produced in situ during the polymerization.

77952801937	Preparation of microencapsulated red phosphorus and its flame-retardant application in PP composites	In the present study, the melamine-formaldehyde prepolymer (MFP) was first synthesized at pH 8-8.5 under about 80°C with melamine, formaldehyde, triethanolamine and methanol as the starting materials. Subsequently, the microencapsulated red phosphorus (MRP) was successfully prepared by in-situ polymerization at pH 5.5 under 65 °C, using MFP and red phosphorus (RP) powders as raw materials, and potassium persulphate (KPS) as catalyst. The obtained products were detected by differential scan calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that KPS is useful in enhancing the reaction activity of MFP, which can make RP be well encapsulated by melamine-formaldehyde resin (MF) and reduce the reaction time. The DSC, SEM and XPS results show that it won't get well-encapsulated MRP only under acidic condition and without any KPS. When a proper quantity of KPS is employed, the RP particles can be almost completely-encapsulated by MF and the peak temperature of oxidation reaction for MRP is 480 °C, which is much higher than that of RP, extending the applications for MRP. The FTIR spectrum demonstrates that the coating material on the surface of RP accurately is MF, in agreement with the reference. Polyproplene (PP) composites with different formulations were prepared by melt extrusion. It was shown that the flame-retardant efficiencies are very low when the PP composites only contain MRP or MH. However, the flame-retardant property can obviously improve if MRP and MH are both used in the PP composites. When PP:MRP:MH=100 (phr):15 (phr):50 (phr), the limited oxygen index of the MRP/MH/PP composite is 26%, and vertical firing ranks UL-94 V-0. In addition, the possible flame-retardant mechanism of the PP composites has also been discussed, and further verified by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.

78651353428	Spectroscopic analysis studies of organo-attapulgite/nylon 6 composites	The surface organic modification of attapulgite with silane coupling reagent was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Qrgano-attapulgite/nylon 6 composites with different content of attapulgite were prepared by means of melt blending, and the crystal structure and morphology were investigated. The results show that the surface content of Si, N and C of the modified attapulgite increased. Combined with the FTIR results, it was confirmed that an organic coating layer was formed on the surface of attapulgite. The adding of attapulgite does not change the crystal structure of nylon 6, but changes the crystallite size of nylon 6. The modified attapulgite was well dispersed in nylon 6 and the silane coupling coating on the attapilgite enhanced the interfacial adhesion.

79952183568	Computational and electrochemical studies on the inhibition of corrosion of mild steel by l-Cysteine and its derivatives	This article presents the investigation of l-Cysteine (CYS) and its derivatives including N-Acetyl-l-Cysteine (NACYS), N-Acetyl-S-Benzyl-l-Cysteine (NASBCYS), and N-Acetyl-S-Hexyl-l-Cysteine (NASHCYS) as green chemical corrosion inhibitors for mild steel in 1 M HCl solutions. Weight loss method and Tafel polarization measurement were performed to determine the corrosion parameters and inhibition efficiencies. Experimental results showed that these compounds suppressed both anodic and cathodic reactions, and the inhibition efficiency of the four inhibitors followed the order NASBCYS > NASHCYS > NACYS > CYS. In order to further study the corrosion mechanisms, quantum chemical calculation and molecular dynamics method were applied. The relationships between quantum chemical parameters and corrosion inhibition efficiency were discussed. Molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the adsorption behavior of each inhibitor in solvent. The results showed that these four inhibitors can adsorb on mild steel surface by donor acceptor interactions between lone-pair electrons of heteroatoms/π-electrons of aromatic ring and vacant d-orbital of iron. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC Reference::.

79952454640	Optical properties of monodispersed silver nanoparticles produced via reverse micelle microemulsion	Silver nanoparticles produced by the sodium borohydride reduction of silver nitrate were stabilized by means of 1-dodecanethiol providing sulfur atom. (n-Dodecyl) trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB), which was used as a phase transfer agent in two-phase system involving water and toluene, played a significant role in the formation of monolayer-protected silver nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultravioletvisible absorption spectroscopy (UVvis), FT-IR spectra and fluorescence. The results indicate that the system is monodispersed and leads to the self-assembly of silver nanoparticles into 0-D quanta-dot arrays. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

79954713175	Morphology-Controlled Fabrication of Sulfonated Graphene/Polyaniline Nanocomposites by Liquid/Liquid Interfacial Polymerization and Investigation of their Electrochemical Properties	A novel morphology-controlled strategy has been developed to fabricate sulfonated graphene/polyaniline (SGEP) nanocomposites by liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization. Sulfonated graphene (SGE) sheets were synthesized and used as both a macromolecular acid dopant and substrate for the polymerization of polyaniline (PANI), affording the SGEP nanocomposites. The morphology of PANI in the nanocomposites can be controlled to be either nanorods or nanogranules by varying the synthesis conditions. The morphology of SGEP and the shape of PANI can be tuned by adding an additional dopant and varying the amount of SGE used, and this had a significant influence on the electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites as supercapacitor electrode materials. The SGEP nanocomposite with PANI nanorods exhibited a specific capacitance of 763 F/g with a capacity retention of 96% after 100 cycles and good rate properties. Composites obtained with HCl as an additional acid dopant with two different ratios of SGE to PANI showed higher specific capacitances of 793 and 931 F/g, but lower capacity retention after 100 cycles of 77% and 76%, respectively. © 2010 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

0035965618	Modifying substrate surfaces with self-assembled polyelectrolyte layers to promote the formation of uniform polypyrrole films	The self-assembled mono- and multilayers (SAMs) of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDMA), poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) were used to modify the substrate surfaces for depositing polypyrrole (PPy) films prepared by in situ polymerization. It was found that the PSS layers could not only lead to thicker and denser PPy films, but also improved the uniformity of the films. Modifying substrates with polyelectrolyte self-assembled layers is a convenient and practical way to improve the quality of some functional films. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

81055147492	Polyurethane grafted attapulgite as novel fillers for nylon 6 nanocomposites	Attapulgite fi bers were modifi ed by polyurethane, forming polyurethane grafted attapulgite (AT-PU), which was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Nylon 6/AT-PU nanocomposites of different modified attapulgite loadings were prepared by melt blending in a twin screw extruder. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation on the fracture surfaces of the nanocomposites showed not only a uniform dispersion of AT-PU but also a strong interfacial adhesion with the matrix. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) were used to illustrate the influence of AT-PU particles on the thermal properties of the nylon 6/AT-PU nanocomposites. The results indicated that the addition of attapulgite probably induced the heterogeneous nucleation and was favorable for the formation of γ -crystalline form, and that the higher thermal stability was obtained for the composites. © 2011 Wuhan University of Technology and Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84859234474	Study on enhancement adsorption of pipemidic acid from aqueous solution by using an amino group modified hypercrosslinked polymeric adsorbents	In the present study, an amino group modified hypercrosslinked polymeric adsorbent RDM-200 was prepared and its ability to adsorb pipemidic acid from aqueous solution was tested by using Amberlite XAD-4 as a comparison. Pipemidic acid adsorption isotherm onto RDM-200 is well described by the Freundlich model. The RDM-200 adsorption capacity for PPA was about 510.5 mg/g at 293 K, exhibited larger uptake and stronger affinity of pipemidic acid than XAD-4. The adsorption thermodynamic parameters were calculated and the adsorption was an exothermic, favorable, and more ordered process. The RDM-200 spontaneously adsorbs pipemidic acid mainly by both entropy change and enthalpy change. The RDM-200 exhibited excellent adsorption ability over the pH range 6-10, NaCl showed the positive effect. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

84873605273	SERS and DFT study of crystal violet	Six silver colloids were prepared by the reduction of silver nitrate with different amounts of sodium citrate. The obtained silver colloids were characterised by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and zeta potential measurements. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activities of these silver colloids were investigated using crystal violet (CV) as a SERS probe. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the level of B3LYP, the Raman spectra and the optimised geometry of CV were analysed. The results show that the sodium citrate content strongly influences the sizes, zeta potentials and SERS activities of the silver colloids. As the sodium citrate content increases in the preparation of silver colloids, the mean diameters of the silver nanoparticles decrease. The most intense SERS of CV on the silver colloids is obtained when 3 mL of 1% sodium citrate is used. CV has D

84882389468	Hydrothermal synthesis of raisin-bun-like CdTe@C nanocomposites toward enhanced photoluminescence and low cytotoxicity	In this paper, cysteamine/glucose grafted CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized and subsequently, the carbon chains wrapped around the surfaces were carbonized via further hydrothermal heat treatment to obtain raisin-bun-like carbon protected CdTe QD nanocomposites (CdTe@C NCs). As shown by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) analysis and Raman spectroscopy, the carbon material was successfully capped around the surface of the CdTe QDs. The optical properties of the as-prepared products were carefully investigated by UV-Vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy techniques. With the protection of the carbon shell the as-synthesized CdTe@C NCs tolerate both acidic and alkaline environments, such as NaCl solutions as well as oxidative hydrogen peroxide. The MTT assay also confirmed the low cytotoxicity of CdTe@C NCs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

0348000873	Spectra on the Influence of Grinding to Kaolinite Structure	Kaolinite clay is one of important ceramic materials. In this paper, the kaolinite clay was ground by dry grinding and wet grinding. The powder samples ground for different time were measured by FTIR spectra and XRD, and the changing rules of the IR absorption frequency and XRD were respectively discussed. The results indicated that wet grinding was superior to dry one. Kaolinite structure began to change while it was ground by dry mothed for 12 h, and the layer structure was destroyed completely till 42 h. However, the day structure didn't change much until 54 h at the condition of wet grinding. The machanism of the kaolinite structure changed were also discussed in detail.

0347286652	Studies on the Interaction of Beryllon III with Proteins by Voltammetric Technique and its Application	A new quantitative determination method of proteins using beryllon III by voltammetric technique was developed in this paper. In pH 3.5 Britton-Robinson (B-R) buffer solution, beryllon III can bind with human serum albumin (HSA) to form an electro-inactive supermolecular complex. Beryllon III has a well-defined voltammetric reduction peak at -0.38 V (vs. SCE) and the addition of protein in this solution can cause the decrease of the reductive peak current. Based on the decrease of the reduction peak current, a new electrochemical method for the determination of HSA was established with linear range of 1.0-40.0 mg/L and the detection limit of 1.0 mg/L. This method is further applied to the determination of real sample of healthy human serum.
