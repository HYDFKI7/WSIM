9244224093	Hematopoietic gene expression profile in zebrafish kidney marrow	The zebrafish kidney marrow is considered to be the organ of definitive hematopoiesis, analogous to the mammalian bone marrow. We have sequenced 26,143 ESTs and isolated 304 cDNAs with putative full-length ORF from a zebrafish kidney marrow cDNA library. The ESTs formed 7,742 assemblies, representing both previously identified zebrafish ESTs (56%) and recently discovered zebrafish ESTs (44%). About 30% of these EST assemblies have orthologues in humans, including 1,282 disease-associated genes in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. Comparison of the effective and regulatory molecules related to erythroid functions across species suggests a good conservation from zebrafish to human. Interestingly, both embryonic and adult zebrafish globin genes showed higher homology to the human embryonic globin genes than to the human fetal/adult ones, consistent with evo-devo correlation hypothesis. In addition, conservation of a whole set of transcription factors involved in globin gene switch suggests the regulatory network for such remodeling mechanism existed before the divergence of the teleost and the ancestor of mammals. We also carried out whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization assays for 493 cDNAs and identified 80 genes (16%) with tissue-specific expression during the first five days of zebrafish development. Twenty-six of these genes were specifically expressed in hematopoietic or vascular tissues, including three previously unidentified zebrafish genes: coro1a, nephrosin, and dab2. Our results indicate that conserved genetic programs regulate vertebrate hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis, and support the role of the zebrafish as an important animal model for studying both normal development and the molecular pathogenesis of human blood diseases.

9244234326	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in deoxycytidine kinase and treatment response among acute myeloid leukaemia patients	Development of resistance to 1-β-arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC) is a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Deficiency of functional deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) plays an important role in AraC resistance in vitro. We screened 5378 bp sequences of the dCK gene, including all exons and the 5′ flanking region, and identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regulatory region (rSNPs) with high allele frequencies. These two rSNPs (-201C>T and -360C>G) formed two major haplotypes. Genotyping with sequencing and MassARRAY system among 122 AML patients showed that those with -360CG/-201CT and -360GG/-201TT compound genotypes (n = 41) displayed a favourable response to chemotherapy whereas those with -360CC/-201CC (n = 81) tended to have a poor response (P = 0.025). Moreover, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that patients with -360CG/-201CTand -360GG/-201TT genotypes expressed higher level of dCK mRNA compared to those with the -360CC/-201CC genotype (P = 0.0034). Luciferase-reporter assay showed that dCK 5′ regulatory region bearing -360G/-201T genotype alone had an eight-fold greater transcriptional activation activity compared to that with -360C/-201C genotype, whereas co-transfection of both -360G/-201T and -360C/-201C constructs mimicked the heterozygous genotype, which exhibited a four-fold greater activity compared to that with -360C/-201C. These results indicate that rSNP haplotypes of dCK gene may serve as a genetic marker for predicting drug responsiveness, which will be beneficial in establishing more effective AML chemotherapeutic regimens. © 2004 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

9244253152	Amino-terminal protein-protein interaction motif (POZ-domain) is responsible for activities of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor-α fusion protein	Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor α (PLZF- RARα), a fusion receptor generated as a result of a variant t(11;17) chromosomal translocation that occurs in a small subset of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients, has been shown to display a dominant- negative effect against the wild-type RARα/retinoid X receptor α (RXRα). We now show that its N-terminal region (called the POZ-domain), which mediates protein-protein interaction as well as specific nuclear localization of the wild-type PLZF and chimeric PLZF-RARα proteins, is primarily responsible fur this activity. To further investigate the mechanisms of PLZF- RARα action, we have also studied its ligand-receptor, protein-protein, and protein-DNA interaction properties and compared them with those of the promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML)-RARα, which is expressed in the majority of APLs as a result of t(15;17) translocation. PLZF-RARα and PML-RARα have essentially the same ligand-binding affinities and can bind in vitro to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) as homodimers or heterodimers with RXRα. PLZF-RARα homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXRα were primarily mediated by the POZ-domain and RARα sequence, respectively. Despite having identical RARα sequences, PLZF-RARα and PML-RARα homodimers recognized with different affinities distinct RAREs. Furthermore, PLZF-RARα could heterodimerize in vitro with the wild-type PLZF, suggesting that it may play a rule in leukemogenesis by antagonizing actions of not only the retinoid receptors but also the wild-type PLZF and possibly other POZ- domain-containing regulators. These different protein-protein interactions and the target gene specificities of PLZF-RARα and PML-RARα may underlie, at least in part, the apparent resistance of APL with t(11;17) to differentiation effects of all-trans-retinoic acid.

9444260940	Protein kinase Cδ mediates retinoic acid and phorbol myristate acetate-induced phospholipid scramblase 1 gene expression: Its role in leukemic cell differentiation	Although phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) was originally identified based on its capacity to promote transbilayer movement of membrane phospholipids, subsequent studies also provided evidence for its role in cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis. In this report, we investigate the potential role of PLSCR1 in leukemic cell differentiation. We show that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an effective differentiation-inducing agent of acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) cells, can elevate PLSCR1 expression in ATRA-sensitive APL cells NB4 and HL60, but not in maturation-resistant NB4-LR1 cells. ATRA- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation is accompanied by increased PLSCR1 expression, whereas only a slight or no elevation of PLSCR1 expression is observed in U937 cells differentiated with dimethyl sulioxide (DMSO), sodium butyrate, or vitamin D3. Cell differentiation with ATRA and PMA, but not with vitamin D3 or DMSO, results in phosphorylation of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), and the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin nearly eliminates the ATRA- and PMA-induced expression of PLSCR1, while ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of PKCδ directly increases PLSCR1 expression. Finally, decreasing PLSCR1 expression with small interfering RNA inhibits ATRA/PMA-induced differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that as a protein induced upon PKCδ activation, PLSCR1 is required for ATRA- and PMA-triggered leukemic cell differentiation. © 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.

15844384861	RIG-E, a human homolog of the murine Ly-6 family, is induced by retinoic acid during the differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cell	In vivo all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), a differentiation inducer, is capable of causing clinical remission in about 90% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The molecular basis for the differentiation of APL cells after treatment with ATRA remains obscure and may involve genes other than the known retinoid nuclear transcription factors. We report here the ATRA-induced gene expression in a cell line (NB4) derived from a patient with APL. By differential display-PCR, we isolated and characterized a novel gene (RIG-E) whose expression is up-regulated by ATRA. The gene is 4.0 kb long, consisting of four exons and three introns, and is localized on human chromosome region 8q24. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a cell surface protein containing 20 amino acids at the N-terminal end corresponding to a signal peptide and an extracellular sequence containing 111 amino acids. The RIG-E coded protein shares some homology with CD59 and with a number of growth factor receptors. It shares high sequence homology with the murine LY- 6 multigene family, whose members are small cysteine-rich proteins differentially expressed in several hematopoietic cell lines and appear to function in signal transduction. It seems that so far RIG-E is the closest human homolog of the LY-6 family. Expression of RIG-E is not restricted to myeloid differentiation, because it is also present in thymocytes and in a number of other tissues at different levels.

1642434327	Molecular Mechanism of mRNA Alternative Splicing	Eukayotic pre-mRNAs are spliced to form mature mRNA. The pre-mRNAs alternative splicing greatly increases the diversity of proteins and the complexity of genes expression. The recognition of splice sites can occur across intron (intron definition) or across exon (exon definition). There are many kinds of alternative splicing patterns, including the choice of alternative splicing sites, the choice of alternative splicing ends, the alternative splicing of mutually exclusive exons, and an intron can be excised from or retained in mRNA. The splice sites choice process is regulated by many kinds of cis-acting and trans-acting elements and is closely related with the basic splicing process. Some of the splicing factors in basic splicing process can regulate the alternative splicing. The alternative splicing is also a co-transcriptional process. Promoters can regulate alternative splicing and produce different mRNA isoforms. Many molecular mechanisms of alternative splicing have been proposed, and it was also found that the RNA editing and trans-splicing could also regulate alternative splicing.

17944362262	Molecular cytogenetic characterization and clinial relevance of additional, complex and/or variant chromosome abnormalities in acute promyelocytic leukemia	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by typical morphological manifestation, t(15;17) translocation and active response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the great majority of patients. However, a subset of APL cases may present atypical phenotypic, cytogenetic or molecular features at different stages of the disease. The biological and clinical significance of these features sometimes remains obscure. In this study, 284 APL patients were cytogenetically analyzed and precise diagnosis was performed according to the molecular cytogenetic results. Twenty-six APL patients were identified as having additional, complex and/or variant chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis or at relapse, 16 of them being further analyzed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or chromosome painting (CP). Interestingly, some of these chromosomal aberrations were found to be associated with atypical morphology and/or drug response, indicating a genotype-phenotype correlation. Analysis of the complex karyotype may also allow a better understanding of the levels of cellular origin of the leukemogenesis. Examination of the remission induction and survival data showed that the presence of the additional/complex chromosome abnormalities was related to the prognosis in both primarily diagnosed and relapsed patients in this series.

20444363269	Desferrioxamine induces leukemic cell differentiation potentially by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α that augments transcriptional activity of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α	We reported recently that cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia and mild hypoxia modified the differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells, probably acting via a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α)-dependent mechanism. In this study, we investigated the effect of desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator with 'hypoxia-mimetic' activity, on the differentiation of AML cells. The results showed that DFO at nontoxic concentrations induced the differentiation of AML cell lines NB4 and U937, as assessed by morphological criteria and differentiation-associated antigens. DFO-induced differentiation parallel to the rapid accumulation of HIF-1α protein in these two cell lines. Of importance, the transient transfection of HIF-1α cDNA induced U937 cells to develop the differentiation-related alterations such as growth arrest and increased CD11b expression. Furthermore, the inducible expression of chromosome translocation t(8;21)-generated leukemogenic AML1-ETO fusion gene attenuated DFO-induced differentiation of U937 cells with the decrease of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), a critical factor for granulocytic differentiation. Using immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay, HIF-1α was also shown to interact physically with and to increase the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα. Taken together, these results provided novel evidence for a role of HIF-1α in AML cell differentiation, and suggested that C/EBPα might be a downstream effector for HIF-1α-mediated differentiation. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

19944431253	AML1-ETO and C-KIT mutation/overexpression in t(8;21) leukemia: Implication in stepwise leukemogenesis and response to Gleevec	To explore the genetic abnormalities that cooperate with AML1-ETO (AE) fusion gene to cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), we screened a number of candidate genes and identified 11 types of mutations in C-KIT gene (mC-KIT), including 6 previously undescribed ones among 26 of 54 (48.1%) cases with t(8;21). To address a possible chronological order between AE and mC-KIT, we showed that, among patients with AE and mC-KIT, most leukemic cells at disease presentation harbored both genetic alteration, whereas in three such cases investigated during complete remission, only AE, but not mC-KIT, could be detected by allele-specific PCR. Therefore, mC-KIT should be a subsequent event on the basis of t(8;21). Furthermore, induced expression of AE in U937-A/E cells significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of C-KIT. This may lead to an alternative way of C-KIT activation and may explain the significantly higher C-KIT expression in 81.3% of patients with t(8;21) than in patients with other leukemias. These data strongly suggest that t(8;21) AML follows a stepwise model in leukemogenesis, i.e., AE represents the first, fundamental genetic hit to initiate the disease, whereas activation of the C-KIT pathway may be a second but also crucial hit for the development of a full-blown leukemia. Additionally, Gleevec suppressed the C-KIT activity and induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis in cells bearing C-KIT N822K mutation or overexpression, but not in cells with D816 mC-KIT. Gleevec also exerted a synergic effect in apoptosis induction with cytarabine, thus providing a potential therapeutic for t(8;21) leukemia.

20044386346	Detection and quantification of BCR-ABL transcripts in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction	Objective: To investigate the effect of real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) for detecting the minimal residual disease (MRD) or monitoring the treatment response and predicting the prognosis. Methods: Fifty-six CML patients, 39 males and 17 females, aged 39 (16 - 66), with disease history and frozen RNA specimens were studied, 31 of which were in the incipient chronic phase, 7 in the accelerated phase, and 17 in the rapidly progressing phase. Three or more frozen RNA specimens collected before and after treatment were preserved in 11 of the patients. Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) of the patients in different CML stages was analyzed by RT-PCR approach. Results: The BCR-ABL transcript of those patients remaining in chronic period after treatment decreased to 1/3 that of the baseline level six months after the initiation of treatment and then remained at that level. The BCR-ABL transcript of those in which progressing change occurred increased when such change occurred. After allogeneic transplantation of peripheral blood stem cells the BCR-ABL level decreased significantly. The median DoseN in the 17 progressing patients was 10492, significantly higher than those of the 31 patients in chronic phase (5920) and in the 7 patients in accelerated phase (4444, both P < 0.05). The minimal residual disease and the treatment response were closely associated with the level and its variation of BCR-ABL transcripts, the transcripts level in blastic crisis was significantly higher than that in chronic phase or accelerated phase. Conclusion: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR is reliable and can be used to detect the minimal residual disease, monitor the treatment outcome, and predicting blastic crisis.

20844439391	Clinical and cytogenetic features of 508 Chinese patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and comparison with those in Western countries	Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and leukemia progression. Racial differences may exist on clinical pictures and the molecular events leading to MDS, which are heterogeneous. To better define the clinical and cytogenetic features in Chinese patients, a retrospective multicentric study was performed in 508 MDS cases. Compared with Western countries, Chinese patients showed younger age (median: 49 vs 65-73 years), lower percentages of RARS (2.8 vs 6.5-15.3%), and CMML (5.2 vs 11.7-30.6%). Cytogenetically, among 367 cases with evaluable data, abnormal karyotypes were found in 136 cases, including 56 numerical and 80 structural changes. Incidences of single chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities were lower than those in Western countries (2.2 vs 17.8-42.5%). However, complex cytogenetic aberrations and chromosome translocations were frequently observed and related to poor prognosis. Both multiple chromosome deletions and translocations were detected in advanced subtypes (RAEB and RAEB-T). Analysis of 200 cases revealed a higher incidence of hepatitis-B-virus infection than that in non-MDS population (21.00 vs 9.75%). This study further confirmed: (1) different genetic/environmental backgrounds between Asian and Western MDS populations; (2) a strong predictive value of cytogenetic abnormalities on disease outcome and involvement of genomic instability in leukemia clone development. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

20944436253	Nanomolar concentration of NSC606985, a camptothecin analog, induces leukemic-cell apoptosis through protein kinase Cδ-dependent mechanisms	As a promising new class of anticancer drugs, camptothecins have advanced to the forefront of several areas of therapeutic and developmental chemotherapy. In the present study, we report that NSC606985, a rarely studied camptothecin analog, induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells NB4 and U937 and inhibits the proliferation without cell death in breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (bcr-abl) kinase-carrying leukemic K562 cells. For apoptosis induction or growth arrest, nanomolar concentrations of NSC606985 are sufficient. At such low concentrations, this agent also significantly inhibits the clonogenic activity of hematopoietic progenitors from patients with AML. For apoptosis induction, NSC606985 rapidly induces the proteolytic activation of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) with loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) and caspase-3 activation. Cotreatment with rottlerin, a PKCδ-specific inhibitor, completely blocks NSC606985-induced mitochondrial Δψm loss and caspase-3 activation, while the inhibition of caspase-3 by z-DEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-DEVD-fmk) only partially attenuates PKCS activation and apoptosis. These data indicate that NSC606985-induced PKCδ activation is an early event upstream to mitochondrial Δψm loss and caspase-3 activation, while activated caspase-3 has an amplifying effect on PKCδ proteolysis. In addition, NSC606985-induced apoptosis by PKCδ also involves caspase-3-independent mechanisms. Taken together, our results suggest that NSC606985 is a potential agent for the treatment of AML. © 2005 by The American Society of Hematology.

21144441198	Systems analysis of transcriptome and proteome in retinoic acid/arsenic trioxide-induced cell differentiation apoptosis of promyelocytic leukemia	Understanding the complexity and dynamics of cancer cells in response to effective therapy requires hypothesis-driven, quantitative, and high-throughput measurement of genes and proteins at both spatial and temporal levels. This study was designed to gain insights into molecular networks underlying the clinical synergy between retinoic acid (RA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which results in a high-quality disease-free survival in most patients after consolidation with conventional chemotherapy. We have applied an approach integrating cDNA microarray, 2D gel electrophoresis with MS, and methods of computational biology to study the effects on APL cell line NB4 treated with RA, ATO, and the combination of the two agents and collected in a time series. Numerous features were revealed that indicated the coordinated regulation of molecular networks from various aspects of granulocytic differentiation and apoptosis at the transcriptome and proteome levels. These features include an array of transcription factors and cofactors, activation of calcium signaling, stimulation of the IFN pathway, activation of the proteasome system, degradation of the PML-RARα oncoprotein, restoration of the nuclear body, cell-cycle arrest, and gain of apoptotic potential. Hence, this investigation has provided not only a detailed understanding of the combined therapeutic effects of RA/ATO in APL but also a road map to approach hematopoietic malignancies at the systems level. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

0029881415	Retinoic acid regulatory pathways, chromosomal translocations, and acute promyelocytic leukemia	Retinoic acids (RAs) exert a broad range of physiologic actions during embryonic development and adult life. Two families of RA receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR), have been identified. The therapeutic effect of all-trans-RA (ATRA) in induction of remission for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has largely been proved, and this has, over the past 10 years, greatly stimulated research on oncogenesis and RA-regulated differentiation pathways. In APL, one of the RAR genes, RARA, is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(15;17). However, a small subset of APL patients have a different fusion gene, PLZF-RARA, resulting from the variant translocation t(11;17). A third translocation, t(5;17), in which the NPM gene is fused to RARA, has been described. Current data suggest that PML-RARα and PLZF-RARα fusion receptors may play an important role in the development of APL and that PML-RARα could be the target of ATRA differentiation therapy. Characterization of the genes regulated by retinoic acid may open up new prospects for an understanding of the mechanisms of ATRA differentiation therapy for APL and may help to extend the concept of cancer-targeting treatment to other types of leukemias or solid tumors.

0029884784	Long-term follow-up of minimal residual disease in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients by polymerase chain reaction analysis of multiple clone-specific or malignancy-specific gene markers	Two types of markers, namely the clone-specific markers including T-cell receptor (TCR) γ, TCR δ and Ig heavy-chain (IgH) gene rearrangements, and malignancy-specific fusion gene mRNA such as SIL-TAL-1, BCR-ABL, and HRX- partner genes, were investigated by molecular biology techniques in 65 Chinese patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In combination, these markers were informative among 96% of patients. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was followed up in 23 of these patients with available materials over a period varying from 8 to 54 months with at least one leukemia-specific probe. In most children, MRD was decreased continuously to an ultimately undetectable level within 6 to 12 months after remission induction therapy. One patient exhibited low-level residual leukemic cells for 4 years before the MRD turned negative. Another patient remained in complete remission for 45 months, although a positive signal was detected at 34 months using TCR δ probe, but was negative with a TCR γ marker which was positive at presentation. In three patients who relapsed, MRD either persisted through the clinical course or became positive and eventually increased 3-11 months before clinical relapse. These data suggested that the combined use of multiple gene markers is a valuable tool for the PCR-based MRD detection, since it can cover most ALL patients. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of MRD is helpful for determining the dosage as well as the period of maintenance chemotherapy and for predicting impending relapse.

0029805290	Molecular diagnosis of hemophilia A in Chinese patients by an analysis of inversions in the factor VIII gene	Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by deleterious mutations in the factor VIII gene. An inversion caused by introchromosomal homologous recombination between the A gene located in intron 22 of the factor VIII gene and one of the two telomeric A genes has been recently described as the common cause of about 50% of cases of severe hemophilia A. The rearrangement can be readily detected by a Southern blotting procedure. We report use of this procedure to detect rearrangements in 106 unrelated Chinese hemophilia A cases. In 49.3% of the patients with severe disease an inversion was found, but no inversion was detected in any of the patients with moderate or mild disease. The majority of inversions (91.4%) involved the most distal A gene; in a minority (8.6%) the more proximal A gene was involved. These results indicate that intron 22 inversion is the most important molecular defect causing Chinese hemophilia A and that analysis for intron 22 inversion may be the first-line test in the molecular diagnosis of severe hemophilia A.

0030589343	The PML and PML/RARα domains: From autoimmunity to molecular oncology and from retinoic acid to arsenic	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is specifically associated to a t(15; 17) translocation which fuses a gene encoding a nuclear receptor for retinoic acid, RARα, to a previously unknown gene PML. The PML protein is localized in the nucleus on a specific domain of unknown function (PML nuclear bodies, NB) previously detected with autoimmune sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). These bodies are nuclear matrix-associated and all of their identified components (PML, Sp100, and NDP52) are sharply upregulated by interferons. We show that autoantibodies against both PML and Sp100 are usually associated in sera with multiple nuclear dot anti-nuclear antibodies and demonstrate that PML is an autoantigen, not only in PBC, but also in other autoimmune diseases. In APL, the PML/RARα fusion interferes with both the retinoic acid (RA) response and PML localization on nuclear bodies, but the respective contribution of each defect to leukemogenesis is unclear. RA induces the terminal differentiation of APL blasts, yielding to complete remissions, and corrects the localization of NB antigens. Arsenic trioxide (As

The results showed an altered SSCP in exon 13 of one patient. Sequencing analysis revealed that the patient had a G to T transversion in codon 383, resulting in the substitution of Lys by Asn. The missense mutation was also confirmed by Southern blot hybridization with an allele-specific oligonucleotide probe. Because it was found at a residue highly conserved through evolution, this mutation is likely to be the cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the patient. Because her parents and child were neither clinically nor genetically affected, it was concluded that the mutation in this patient arose de novo and was not passed to her child. This is the first report of a mutant cardiac β-MHC gene in the Chinese population. Also, it is a novel missense mutation of the cardiac β-MHC gene.

0030890942	Arsenic-induced PML targeting onto nuclear bodies: Implications for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with the t(15;17) translocation, which generates a PML/RARα fusion protein between PML, a growth suppressor localized on nuclear matrix-associated bodies, and RARα, a nuclear receptor for retinoic acid (RA). PML/RARα was proposed to block myeloid differentiation through inhibition of nuclear receptor response, as does a dominant negative RARα mutant. In addition, in APL cells, PML/RARα displaces PML and other nuclear body (NB) antigens onto nuclear microspeckles, likely resulting in the loss of PML and/or NB functions. RA leads to clinical remissions through induction of terminal differentiation, for which the respective contributions of RARα (or PML/RARα) activation, PML/RARα degradation, and restoration of NB antigens localization are poorly determined. Arsenic trioxide also leads to remissions in APL patients, presumably through induction of apoptosis. We demonstrate that in non-APL cells, arsenic recruits the nucleoplasmic form of several NB antigens onto NB, but induces the degradation of PML only, identifying a powerful tool to approach NB function. In APL cells, arsenic targets PML and PML/RARα onto NB and induces their degradation. Thus, RA and arsenic target RARα and PML, respectively, but both induce the degradation of the PML/RARα fusion protein, which should contribute to their therapeutic effects. The difference in the cellular events triggered by these two agents likely stems from RA- induced transcriptional activation and arsenic effects on NB proteins.

0031278165	Acute promyelocytic leukemia: Cellular and molecular basis of differentiation and apoptosis	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for about 10% of all acute myeloid leukemias and is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(15;17), which fuses the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) α gene to the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene. The PML-RAR α fusion gene plays an important role in leukemogenesis through antagonizing retinoic acid signalling and the regulatory pathways mediated by PML. APL is the first example of a human cancer that can be effectively treated with the differentiation inducer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The therapeutic effect of ATRA in APL has been associated with the direct modulation of PML- RAR α, the restoration of the differentiation pathways regulated by wild- type RAR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer and PML.

0032077334	Detection of chromosome over- and underrepresentations in hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia by comparative genomic hybridization	Chromosomal analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is often difficult because of the suboptimal in vitro growth of the immature lymphoid cell and the poor morphology obtained. In this study, we describe the application of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to investigate the genomic abnormalities in 14 patients with ALL, all of whom had cytogenetically identified numerical aberrations or gross chromosomal structural alteration. With the use of CGH, regional or whole chromosome overrepresentation or both were found to be more frequent than underrepresentation (52 gains vs. 6 losses), the most common gains being chromosomes 21 and X. The results of the comparison between CGH and conventional B-banding analysis could be classified into three categories: (1) in three cases, including two with trisomy, CGH and banding analysis gave identical results; (2) in six cases with hyperdiploidy and two cases presenting chromosome structural abnormalities, the results were consistent but with minor discrepancies; (3) in three cases, including two with triploidy and tetraploidy and one with chimeric karyotype together with +22, the data from CGH and cytogenetical analysis were discrepant. CGH could not find the triploidy and tetraploidy. Our results suggest that CGH has certain value in the detection of gains or losses of chromosome materials in hyperdiploid ALL. Nevertheless, the combination of CGH and conventional karyotyping provides more precise information on the genomic imbalance in ALL.

Methods 100 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 219 patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) were from Rui Jin Hospital, Xin Hua Hospital, Ren Ji Hospital and Shanghai Children's Hospital. Their cytogenetic data were analyzed together with those of morphology, immunology and clinical prognosis. Results In ALL group, 48 cases were karyotypically normal whereas 52 cases revealed chromosomal changes, among which 32 had quantitative abnormalities and 20 had qualitative abnormalities. The translocation t (9;22) was identified in 11 out of 20 cases of structural aberrations (55%). Specific structural aberrations t (9;22) and t(8;14) were detected to be related to B-lineage associated differentiation antigens and t (8; 14) also with ALL-L3 according to FAB classification. With regard to clinical prognosis, the survival rate of structural aberration subset decreased significantly compared with the normal karyotype subset (P<0.05). However, no statistically significant difference was found between hyperdiploidy subset (not including near-triploidy) and normal karyotype subset (P>0.75). In ANLL group, 80% of de novo patients and relapsed patients had chromosomal abnormalities. Importantly, structural aberrations accounted for 73% of these abnormalities and frequently corresponded to specific types of FAB classification. Relevant prognostic studies demonstrated that t (15; 17) subset had the best overall survival probability, followed by t (8; 21) and normal karyotype subset, while the numerical aberration subset showed a relatively poor prognosis. Conclusion Our data confirmed that cytogenetic study is important for the molecular study of the leukemogenesis. On the other hand, it also provides an independent parameter for prognosis in acute leukemia.

25844504150	How patients have benefited from mouse models of acute promyelocytic leukaemia	One of the challenges of studying anticancer therapies is that effects observed in cell lines or mouse models are not always good indicators of clinical trial results. The mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukaemia has bucked this trend, as targeted therapies such as retinoic acid and arsenic induce differentiation and clearance of leukaemia cells in both mice and humans. This mouse model has also provided important mechanistic insights into the combinatorial effects of these agents and has promoted combined therapies that have shown recent success in the clinic. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

27444436367	Identification and characterization of a novel human histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase	Histone methylation plays an important role in eukaryotic transcriptional regulation. A number of histone methyltransferases (HMTases) with distinct functions have been identified. The HSPC069/HYPB gene was originally isolated from the human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and it was also identified as a huntingtin interacting protein, implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington disease (HD). However, its biochemical function is poorly understood. Here we report the structural and functional characterization of the huntingtin interacting protein B (HYPB). 1) The triplicate AWS-SET-PostSET domains mediate a histone H3 lysine 36 specific HMTase activity. 2) A low charged region that is rich in glutamine and proline has been characterized as a novel transcriptional activation domain. The structural features of this region are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. 3) Coimmunoprecipitation assays indicate that HYPB protein associates with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) but not the unphosphorylated form. Furthermore, the RNAPII-association region of HYPB protein has been identified to encompass the C-terminal 142 amino acids. Thus, our results suggest that HYPB HMTase may coordinate histone methylation and transcriptional regulation in mammals and open perspective for the further study of the potential roles of HYPB protein in hematopoiesis and pathogenesis of HD. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

29244481153	Acute promyelocytic leukemia: A model of molecular target based therapy	Leukemia, a group of hematological malignancies characterized by clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells with uncontrolled proliferation, decreased apoptosis and blocked differentiation, is one of the most notorious enemies of mankind which accounts for some 300,000 new cases and 222,000 deaths each year worldwide [1 -4]. Leukemia can be divided into acute or chronic, lymphoid or myeloid types, based on the disease progression and hematopoietic lineages involved [5]. The responses of leukemia to therapies differ from one type or subtype to another. Hence, to improve the clinical outcome, the therapeutic strategies should be disease pathogenesis-based and individualized. The close collaboration between bench and bedside may not only shed new lights on leukemogenesis, gain insights into therapeutic mechanisms, but also provide opportunities for designing more rational therapies. The development of curative approaches for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) may serve as a paradigm [6]. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

30444434288	Induction of tumor arrest and differentiation with prolonged survival by intermittent hypoxia in a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia	We showed previously that mild real hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetic agents induced in vitro cell differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We here investigate the in vivo effects of intermittent hypoxia on syngenic grafts of leukemic blasts in a PML-RARα transgenic mouse model of AML. For intermittent hypoxia, leukemic mice were housed in a hypoxia chamber equivalent to an altitude of 6000 m for 18 hours every consecutive day. The results show that intermittent hypoxia significantly prolongs the survival of the leukemic mice that received transplants, although it fails to cure the disease. By histologic and cytologic analyses, intermittent hypoxia is shown to inhibit the infiltration of leukemic blasts in peripheral blood, bone marrow, spleen, and liver without apoptosis induction. More intriguingly, intermittent hypoxia also induces leukemic cells to undergo differentiation with progressive increase of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α protein, as evidenced by morphologic criteria of maturating myeloid cells and increased expression of mouse myeloid cell differentiation-related antigens Gr-1 and Mac-1. Taken together, this study represents the first attempt to characterize the in vivo effects of hypoxia on an AML mouse model. Additional investigations may uncover ways to mimic the differentiative effects of hypoxia in a manner that will benefit human patients with AML. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology.

3042589472	Gene expression profiling in human insulinoma tissue: Genes involved in the insulin secretion pathway and cloning of novel full-length cDNAs	Insulinoma is a clinically common cause of organic hypoglycemia. The prominent characteristic of insulinoma is endogenous hyperinsulinism. Until now, the molecular biology of human insulinoma has been little understood. In this study, gene expression profiling of human insulinoma was established by expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing and cDNA array. A total of 2063 clones were obtained, of these, 1589 clones were derived from EST sequencing, 975 clones were derived from cDNA array and 501 clones were shared by the two methods. G protein α-stimulating activity polypeptide (Gsα) and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) were the most highly expressed genes in human insulinoma, as derived by EST sequencing and cDNA array respectively. The genes involved in the protein/insulin secretion pathway were strongly expressed in human insulinoma tissue. Meanwhile, eight full-length cDNAs of novel genes were cloned and sequenced. The results demonstrated the molecular biology of human insulinoma tissue at the level of transcript abundance and validated the efficacy of EST sequencing combined with cDNA array in the construction of gene expression profiling. In conclusion, the predominance of the genes participating in the secretory pathway suggested that regulation of secretion might be a major mechanism by which insulin release is abnormally increased in patients with insulinomas. It was also concluded that overexpression of the Gsα gene played an important role in the pathogenesis of insulinoma.

32644449422	Coordination of intrinsic, extrinsic, and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated apoptosis by imatinib mesylate combined with arsenic trioxide in chronic myeloid leukemia	A treatment strategy that combines arsenic trioxide (ATO) with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec) appears to induce markedly more cell apoptosis than imatinib mesylate alone in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To understand the mechanisms underlying the synergistic/additive action of these agents, we applied cDNAmicroarrays, component plane presentation integrated self-organizing map (CPP-SOM), and methods of protein biochemistry to study cell apoptosis induced by imatinib mesylate, ATO, and the combination of the 2 agents in the CML cell line K562. Numerous features with temporospatial relationships were revealed, indicating the coordinated regulation of molecular networks from various aspects of proapoptotic and apoptotic activities in CML. Imatinib mesylate appears to induce mainly the intrinsic pathway of cell apoptosis, whereas ATO induces the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated pathway of cell apoptosis, and the combination of the 2 agents seems to more effectively induce the intrinsic, extrinsic, and ER stress-mediated pathways of cell apoptosis, which results in a more effective and efficient induction of programmed cell death in K562 cells. This finding appears to be supported also by data derived from bone marrow cells of 2 patients with CML, one in chronic phase and the other in blast-crisis phase of the disease. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology.

33646354585	"Beijing Region" (3pter-D3S3397) of the Human Genome: Complete sequence and analysis	The goal of the Human Genome Project (HGP) is to determine a complete and high-quality sequence of the human genome. China, as one of the six member states, takes a region between 3pter and D3S3397 of the human chromosome 3 as its share of this historic project, referred as "Beijing Region". The complete sequence of this region comprises of 17.4 megabasepairs (Mb) with an average GC content of 42% and an average recombination rate of 2.14 cM/Mb. Within Beijing Region, 122 known and 20 novel genes are identified, as well as 42607 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Comprehensive analyses also reveal: (i) gene density and GC-content of Beijing Region are in agreement with human cytogenetic maps, i.e. G-minus bands are GC-rich and of a high gene density, whereas G-plus bands are GC-poor and of a relatively low gene density; (ii) the average recombination rate within Beijing Region is relatively high compared with other regions of chromosome 3, with the highest recombination rate of 6.06 cM/Mb in the subtelomeric area; (iii) it is most likely that a large gene, associated with the mammary gland, may reside in the 1.1 Mb gene-poor area near the telomere; (iv) many disease-related genes are genetically mapped to Beijing Region, including those associated with cancers and metabolic syndromes. All make Beijing Region an important target for in-depth molecular investigations with a purpose of medical applications. Copyright by Science in China Press 2005.

33646417021	Trans-repressive effect of NUP98-PMX1 on PMX1-regulated c-FOS gene through recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 by FG repeats	The formation of fusion genes between NUP98 and members of the HOX family represents a critical factor for the genesis of acute leukemia or acute transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the leukemogenesis of NUP98-HOX fusion products, we cloned NUP98-PMX1 from a CML-blast crisis patient with t(1;11) as a secondary chromosomal translocation, and functionally studied the fusion products in detail through various molecular and protein biochemical assays. In addition to many interesting features, we have found that the NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein exerts a repressive effect on PMX1 or serum response factor-mediated c-FOS activation, probably through the recruitment of a common corepressor histone deacetylase 1 by FG domains of the NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein. Moreover, we have provided evidence that the FG domains of NUP98-PMX1 and two other NUP98-containing fusion proteins, i.e., NUP98-HOXA9 and NUP98-HOXC11, all exhibit dual binding ability to both CREB binding protein, a coactivator, and histone deacetylase 1, a corepressor. Accordingly, we have hypothesized that this dual binding activity is shared by most, if not all, NUP98-HOX-involved fusion proteins, enabling these fusion proteins to act as both trans-activators and trans-repressors, and contributing to the genesis of acute leukemia or acute transformation of CML. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33744471894	Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by Streptococcus suis serotype 2	Background: Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (S. suis 2, SS2) is a major zoonotic pathogen that causes only sporadic cases of meningitis and sepsis in humans. Most if not all cases of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) that have been well-documented to date were associated with the non-SS2 group A streptococcus (GAS). However, a recent large-scale outbreak of SS2 in Sichuan Province, China, appeared to be caused by more invasive deep-tissue infection with STSS, characterized by acute high fever, vascular collapse, hypotension, shock, and multiple organ failure. Methods and Findings: We investigated this outbreak of SS2 infections in both human and pigs, which took place from July to August, 2005, through clinical observation and laboratory experiments. Clinical and pathological characterization of the human patients revealed the hallmarks of typical STSS, which to date had only been associated with GAS infection. Retrospectively, we found that this outbreak was very similar to an earlier outbreak in Jiangsu Province, China, in 1998. We isolated and analyzed 37 bacterial strains from human specimens and eight from pig specimens of the recent outbreak, as well as three human isolates and two pig isolates from the 1998 outbreak we had kept in our laboratory. The bacterial isolates were examined using light microscopy observation, pig infection experiments, multiplex-PCR assay, as well as restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and multiple sequence alignment analyses. Multiple lines of evidence confirmed that highly virulent strains of SS2 were the causative agents of both outbreaks. Conclusions: We report, to our knowledge for the first time, two outbreaks of STSS caused by SS2, a non-GAS streptococcus. The 2005 outbreak was associated with 38 deaths out of 204 documented human cases; the 1998 outbreak with 14 deaths out of 25 reported human cases. Most of the fatal cases were characterized by STSS; some of them by meningitis or severe septicemia. The molecular mechanisms underlying these human STSS outbreaks in human beings remain unclear and an objective for further study. Copyright: © 2006 Tang et al.

33744812702	NOTCH1 mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Prognostic significance and implication in multifactorial leukemogenesis	Purpose: NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). To gain insight into its clinical significance, NOTCH1 mutation was investigated in 77 patients with T-ALL. Experimental Design: Detection of NOTCH1 mutation was done using reverse transcription-PCR amplification and direct sequencing, and thereby compared according to the clinical/ biological data of the patients. Results: Thirty-two mutations were identified in 29 patients (with dual mutations in 3 cases), involving not only the heterodimerization and proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine domains as previously reported but also the transcription activation and ankyrin repeat domains revealed for the first time. These mutations were significantly associated with elevated WBC count at diagnosis and independently linked to short survival time. Interestingly, the statistically significant difference of survival according to NOTCH1 mutations was only observed in adult patients (>18 years) but not in pediatric patients (≤18 years), possibly due to the relatively good overall response of childhood T-ALL to the current chemotherapy. NOTCH1 mutations could coexist with HOX11, HOX11L2, or SIL-TAL1 expression. The negative effect of NOTCH1 mutation on prognosis was potentiated by HOX11L2 but was attenuated by HOX11. Conclusion: NOTCH1 mutation is an important prognostic marker in T-ALL and its predictive value could be even further increased if coevaluated with other T-cell-related regulatory genes. NOTCH pathway thus acts combinatorially with oncogenic transcriptional factors on T-ALL pathogenesis. © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research.

33748527187	Cloning and functional analysis of cdnas with entire open reading frame for 300 previously undefined genes expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells	300 cDNAs containing putatively entire open reading frames (ORFs) for previously undefined genes were obtained from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), based on EST cataloging, clone sequencing, in silica cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their ORFs coded for peptides of 58 to 752 amino acids. Public database search indicated that 225 cDNAs exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species (bacteria, yeast, drosophila, arabidopsis and mammals not including primates). Homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structure motifs/domains among these cDNAs. Genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cDNA data with genome sequence information. Interestingly, a new gene named as HSPC070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3' UTR with RAF gene in reversed transcription orientation. Chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid (RH) for 38 ones. Macro-array technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in 5 hematopoietic cell lines (NB4, HL60, U937, K562 and Jurkat) and a number of genes with differential expression were found. The resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic DNA sequence, but also for further research on the molecular regulation of hematopoietic development and differentiation. The biological functions of these previously undefined genes with regard to hematopoiesis are now under investigation.

33748549644	HSPC070, a novel ring finger protein gene, is preferentially expressed in myelocytic lineage and involved in g-protein mediated signal transduction	In a recent work, we identified 9866 ESTs from cord blood originated CD34+ hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells. From these ESTs, 300 cDNAs containing entire open reading frames for previously undefined genes were cloned. HspcOVO, one of these novel gene cDNAs, was found to bear 3050bp encoding a protein of 416 amino acids. Northern blot showed that it is widely expressed in different human tissues but preferentially in hematopoietic cell line K562, NB4 and BJAB. Structure and functional prediction with bioinformatics tools revealed that it contains a typical C3HC4 RING finger motif. To further address its biological functions in the context of protein-protein interaction, yeast-two hybrid Gal4 system was applied, and a G protein beta-2 subunit was picked out and found to interact on Hspc070. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed with the GST-pull-down test. Further study using yeast-two hybrid system revealed that hspc070 might also interact with several ubiquitin-like proteins. These findings suggested that HSPC070 might be involved in the regulation of G protein mediated signal transduction pathway through degradation of some effective molecules. Now we are performing in vivo immunoprecipitation to further confirm the existence of this G protein beta-2/Hspc070/ubiquitin-like protein complex. The physiological role of this putative protein-protein interaction will also be examined.

33748558447	Functional study on several novel retinoic acid induced genes (rigs)	Studies were designed to identify and characterize regulatory factors involved in alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. We used suppression subtractive hybridization and differential display PCR (DDPCR) to screen the genes modulated by ATRA during differentiation of the APL cell lineNB4. A number of novel retinoic acid-induced genes (RIGs) were identified, and the functions of two were further investigated. RIG-K, which encodes a protein of 773 aa, was found to be up-regulated at 3 hours of ATRA treatment in NB4 and HL-60 cells, and paralleled ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. No induction of RIG-K expression was observed during DMSO induction of granulocytic differentiation or TPA induced monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells. RIG-K expression in NB4-R1, an ATRA resistant subclone of NB4, was not induced by ATRA alone, while a strong induction was observed by ATRA in combination with cAMP. RIG-K exhibits 48% amino-acid identity over a region of about 300 aa to a newly reported protein-myotilin, which also has two Ig-like domains in its C terminal region, although their N terminal sequences are quite different. Blocking RIG-K expression in NB4 cells by a specific hammer-head ribozyme caused partial resistance to ATRA treatment, indicating that it may play an important role in ATRA-induced differentiation. The second gene, RIG-G, coding for a protein of 490 aa, showed similar expression patterns to RJG-K in NB4 cells as well as other cell lines treated with different inducers. RIG-G bears strong homology to a family of genes without known functions but induced by Interferon. Using the yeast-two hybrid system, RIG-G interacted with Jun associated protein 1 (JAP-1). We presume that RIG-G may play a role in the differentiation process through interaction with the AP-1 pathway.

33846213881	Aberrant transcriptional regulation of the MLL fusion partner EEN by AML1-ETO and its implication in leukemogenesis	The EEN (extra eleven nineteen) gene, located on chromosome 19p13, was cloned as a fusion with MLL from a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation t(11;19)(q23;p13). In this study, we characterized the genomic structure of the EEN gene, including its 5′ regulatory region and transcription start site (TSS). We found that Sp1 could bind to the guanine-cytosine (GC)-stretch of the EEN promoter and was critical for the normal EEN expression, whereas the leukemia-associated fusion protein AML1-ETO could aberrantly transactivate the EEN gene through an AML1 binding site. Of note, overexpressed EEN showed oncogenic properties, such as transforming potential in NIH3T3 cells, stimulating cell proliferation, and increasing the activity of transcriptional factor AP-1. Retroviral transduction of EEN increased self-renewal and proliferation of murine hematopoietic progenitor cells. Moreover, Kasumi-1 and HL60-cell growth was inhibited with down-regulation of EEN by RNAi. These findings demonstrate that EEN might be a common target in 2 major types of AML associated with MLL or AML1 translocations, and overexpression of EEN may play an essential role in leukemogenesis. © 2007 by The American Society of Hematology.

33847781444	Adaptive genic evolution in the Drosophila genomes	Determining the extent of adaptive evolution at the genomic level is central to our understanding of molecular evolution. A suitable observation for this purpose would consist of polymorphic data on a large and unbiased collection of genes from two closely related species, each having a large and stable population. In this study, we sequenced 419 genes from 24 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and its close relatives. Together with data from Drosophila simulans, these data reveal the following. (i) Approximately 10% of the loci in regions of normal recombination are much less polymorphic at silent sites than expected, hinting at the action of selective sweeps. (ii) The level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with the rate of nonsynonymous divergence across loci. Thus, even under strict neutrality, the ratio of amino acid to silent nucleotide changes (A:S) between Drosophila species is expected to be 25-40% higher than the A:S ratio for polymorphism when data are pooled across the genome. (iii) The observed A/S ratio between species among the 419 loci is 28.9% higher than the (adjusted) neutral expectation. We estimate that nearly 30% of the amino acid substitutions between D. melanogaster and its close relatives were adaptive. (iv) This signature of adaptive evolution is observable only in regions of normal recombination. Hence, the low level of polymorphism observed in regions of reduced recombination may not be driven primarily by positive selection. Finally, we discuss the theories and data pertaining to the interpretation of adaptive evolution in genomic studies. © 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

The introduction of all-tews-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (As,O3) as a therapeutic agent in APL achieved a high rate of complete remission (CR), most importantly, with a rapid disappearance of the bleeding diathesis. To study the in vivo effect of ATRA or As2O, on the expression of tissue factor (TF) and the other hemostatic disorders, a series of parameters were measured either in bone marrow blasts or plasma from APL patients.

33947585315	Palladin regulates cell and extracellular matrix interaction through maintaining normal actin cytoskeleton architecture and stabilizing beta1-integrin	Cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction plays an important role in development and normal cellular function. Cell adhesion and cell spreading on ECM are two basic cellular behaviors related to cell-ECM interaction. Here we show that palladin, a novel actin cytoskeleton-associated protein, is actively involved in the regulation of cell-ECM interaction. It was found that palladin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) display decreased cell adhesion and compromised cell spreading on various ECMs. Disorganized actin cytoskeleton architecture characterized by faint stress fibers, less lamellipodia and focal adhesions can account for the weakened cell-ECM interaction in palladin

34147181120	Mutant Transcription Factors and Tyrosine Kinases as Therapeutic Targets for Leukemias: From Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia to Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and Beyond	Mutations in transcription factors (TFs) and protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), which result in inhibition of differentiation/apoptosis or enhanced proliferative/survival advantage of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, are two classes of the most frequently detected genetic abnormalities in leukemias. The critical roles for mutant TFs and/or PTKs to play in leukemogenesis, and the absence of mutant TFs/PTKs in normal hematopoietic cells, suggest that the two types of aberrant molecules may serve as ideal therapeutic targets. The great success of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia through modulation of the causative PML-RARα oncoprotein represents the first two paradigms of mutant TFs-targeting therapeutic strategies for leukemia. More recently, tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571/Imatinib mesylate/Gleevec in the treatment of Breakpoint Cluster Region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) positive leukemia elicits paradigm of mutant PTKs as ideal antileukemia targets. Thus to further improve clinical outcome of leukemia patients, elucidation of pathogenesis of leukemia, screening for oncoprotein-targeting small molecules, as well as rationally designed combination of drugs with potential synergy are of importance. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

34250338823	Effect of antisense and decoy oligonucleotide of nuclear factor-kappa B on the proliferation of smooth muscle cells	Aim: To investigate the interventional effect of decoy oligonucleotide and antisense oligonucleotide of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) by the means of lipofectamine transfection on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and neointimal hyperplasia in injured rat carotid arteries. Methods: The experiment was conducted in the Cardiovascular Laboratory of Ruijin Hospital and the Cellular Biology Laboratory of Medical College of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from May 2001 to March 2003. Rat models of thoracic aorta balloon injury were established. 126 SD rats were randomly divided into 7 groups (n = 18). Normal control group (the procedure was the same as other group except for balloon injury), antisense group, sense group, decoy group, scramble group, antisense plus decoy group and model group, and each group was subdivided according to 6 time-points (6 hours and 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 days after operation) with 3 rats in each time-point. The decoy and antisense oligonucleotides of lipofectamine-mediated NF-κB were transferred into VSMCs and carotid artery by means of lipofectamine-oligonucleotides compounds. The specimen was collected and studied at different time-points. The proliferative activity in rat carotid artery was evaluated after injury by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-immunostaining. Vascular proliferation marker was tested by transfecting different oligonucleotide after balloon injury. NF-κB p65 protein synthesis was investigated by the analysis of western blot in injured rat carotid arteries. Results: A total of 126 rats were involved in the analysis of results. 1 In antisense group, decoy group and decoy plus antisense group, the expression of proliferating call nuclear antigen (PCNA) were lower than that in the positive control group, and the differences were significant (respectively were 348.55±39.63, 369.05±71.56, 309.33±12.86, 635.16±89.95, P < 0.05). It was lower in the antisense group than that in the sense group, and the differences were obvious (which were respectively 348.55±39.63, 752.11±76.43, P < 0.05). It was significantly lower in the decoy group than that in the scramble group (which were respectively 369.05±71.56, 818.31±102.29, P < 0.05). Combined effect of antisense and decoy oligonucleotide in inhibiting VSMCs proliferation was more obvious than that of alone. However, there was no statistical difference. 2 The BrdU incorporation increased more significantly at one day after carotid artery injury was obviously higher than that in the normal control group and that at 6 hours after balloon injury, [which were respectively (22.52±0.21)%, (0.02±0.01)%, (4.16±0.22)%, P < 0.05]. The expression of BrdU was the most significant at 3 days after balloon injury (48.71±0.22)%, and the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The expression of BrdU decreased gradually since 3 days after balloon injury of carotid artery. 3 PCNA expression at 3 days after balloon injury was significantly higher in the sense group, antisense group, decoy group, scramble group, antisense plus decoy group and model group than that in the normal control group (which were respectively 41.63±4.06, 22.57±2.62, 21.64±2.98, 38.89±6.33, 21.06±2.89, 41.48±3.09, 4.49±0.79, P < 0.01), and it was lower in the antisense group than that in the sense group (P < 0.05), it was lower in the decoy group than that in the scramble group (P < 0.05). The effect in the antisense plus decoy group was a little lower than that in the sense group and decoy group, while there was no statistical difference. The expression of PCNA in the antisense group, decoy group and antisense plus decoy group were obviously lower than that in the model group, and the differences were significant (P < 0.05). 4 BrdU incorporation at 3 days after balloon injury in the sense group, antisense group, decoy group, scramble group, antisense plus decoy group and model group were obviously higher than that in the normal control group (which were respectively 56.23±2.00, 28.97±1.14, 26.64±2.89, 48.89±2.28, 21.06±2.89, 51.48±3.09, 14.49±0.79, P < 0.05), and it was lower in the antisense group than that in the sense group (P < 0.05), it was lower in the decoy group than that in the scramble group (P < 0.05). The effect in the antisense plus decoy group was greatly lower than that in the antisense group and scramble group, and the differences were significant (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the expression of BrdU was obviously lower in the antisense group, decoy group and antisense plus decoy group, and the differences were significant (P < 0.05). 5 The protein expression of NF-κB p65 at 7 days after balloon-injured carotid artery in the model group, sense group, antisense group, scramble group, decoy group and antisense plus decoy group were significantly higher than that in the normal control group (which were respectively 1.86±0.03, 1.67±0.10, 1.25±0.01, 1.51±0.01, 1.41±0.07, 1.19±0.02, 0.84± 0.01, P < 0.05), and it was lower in the antisense group than that in the sense group (P < 0.05), while there was no differenc between the decoy group and scramble group. The protein expression of NF-κB p65 in the antisense plus decoy group was remarkably lower than that in the decoy group (P < 0.05), while there was no statistical difference in comparison with the antisense group. And it was lower in the antisense group, decoy group and antisense plus decoy group than that in the model group (P < 0.05), and the differences were significant (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Both decoy and antisense oligonucleotides of NF-κB p65 can inhibit the proliferation of VSMCs. The vascular cells show dynamic proliferation after balloon-injured carotid artery in rats. Antisense oligonucleotide can decrease NF-κB p65 expression, whereas there was no effect on NF-κB p65 with decoy oligonucleotide.

34347384854	Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia with all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide: A paradigm of synergistic molecular targeting therapy	To turn a disease from highly fatal to highly curable is extremely difficult, especially when the disease is a type of cancer. However, we can gain some insight into how this can be done by looking back over the 50-year history of taming acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). APL is the M3 type of acute myeloid leukaemia characterized by an accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes in bone marrow, a severe bleeding tendency and the presence of the chromosomal translocation t(15;17) or variants. APL was considered the most fatal type of acute leukaemia five decades ago and the treatment of APL was a nightmare for physicians. Great efforts have been made by scientists worldwide to conquer this disease. The first use of chemotherapy (CT) was unsuccessful due to lack of supportive care and cytotoxic-agent-related exacerbated coagulopathy. The first breakthrough came from the use of anthracyclines which improved the complete remission (CR) rate, though the 5-year overall survival could only be attained in a small proportion of patients. A rational and intriguing hypothesis, to induce differentiation of APL cells rather than killing them, was raised in the 1970s. Laudably, the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in treating APL resulted in terminal differentiation of APL cells and a 90-95% CR rate of patients, turning differentiation therapy in cancer treatment from hypothesis to practice. The combination of ATRA with CT further improved the 5-year overall survival. When arsenic trioxide (ATO) was used to treat relapsed APL not only the patients but also the ancient drug were revived. ATO exerts dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells: at low concentration, ATO induces partial differentiation, while at relatively high concentration, it triggers apoptosis. Of note, both ATRA and ATO trigger catabolism of the PML-RARα fusion protein which is the key player in APL leukaemogenesis generated from t(15;17), targeting the RARα (retinoic acid receptor α) or promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) moieties, respectively. Hence, in treating APL both ATRA and ATO represent paradigms for molecularly targeted therapy. At molecular level, ATRA and ATO synergistically modulate multiple downstream pathways/cascades. Strikingly, a clearance of PML-RARα transcript in an earlier and more thorough manner, and a higher quality remission and survival in newly diagnosed APL are achieved when ATRA is combined with ATO, as compared to either monotherapy, making APL a curable disease. Thus, the story of APL can serve as a model for the development of curative approaches for disease; it suggests that molecularly synergistic targeted therapies are powerful tools in cancer, and dissection of disease pathogenesis or anatomy of the cancer genome is critical in developing molecular target-based therapies. © 2007 The Royal Society.

34347392288	Rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) overcomes PRDM1-associated resistance to chemotherapy in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	The positive regulatory domain I (PRDM1) is a master regulator in the differentiation of mature B lymphocytes to plasma cells. It has 2 isoforms, PRDM1α and PRDM1β, and is regulated by the transcriptional regulator nuclear factor kappa (NF)-κB. PRDM1 protein expression was recently demonstrated in a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with aggressive behavior, a type of lymphoma for which rituximab associated with chemotherapy (R-CHOP) is now widely indicated. Using laser microdissection combined with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification, PRDM1 gene expression was assessed in 82 DLBCL patients. The results showed that both PRDM1α and PRDM1β transcripts were expressed in microdissected lymphoma cells only in the non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) subtype of DLBCL. PRDM1β gene expression was correlated with short survival time in the non-GCB patients treated with CHOP but not with R-CHOP. In vitro, B-lymphoma cells resistant to chemotherapy expressed PRDM1β. Rituximab suppressed PRDM1β expression, which was concomitant with NF-κB inactivation. The value of PRDM1β expression as a prognostic marker in non-GCB DLBCL might thus be considered. This study confirms the efficiency of rituximab on DLBCL and allows a better understanding of one of its biologic actions. © 2007 by The American Society of Hematology.

34548423608	From dissection of disease pathogenesis to elucidation of mechanisms of targeted therapies: Leukemia research in the genomic era	Leukemia is a group of heterozygous diseases of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that involves dynamic change in the genome. Dissection of genetic abnormalities critical to leukemia initiation provides insights into the elusive leukemogenesis, identifies distinct subsets of leukemia and predicts prognosis individually, and can also provide rational therapeutic targets for curative approaches. The past three decades have seen tremendous advances in the analysis of genotype-phenotype connection of leukemia, and in the identification of molecular biomarkers for leukemia subtypes. Intriguingly, differentiation therapy, targeted therapy and chemotherapy have turned several subtypes of leukemia from highly fatal to highly curable. The use of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, which trigger degradation of PML-RARα, the causative fusion protein generated by t (15;17) translocation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), has led to a dramatic improvement of APL clinical outcome. Imatinib mesylate/ Gleevec/STI571, which inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL oncoprotein, has now become the new gold standard for the treatmtent of chronic myeloid leukemia. Optimal use of chemotherapeutic agents together with a stringent application of prognostic factors for risk-directed therapy in clinical trials has resulted in a steady improvement in the treatment outcome of acute lympho-blastic leukemia. Hence, the pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of leukemia control in the twenty-first century. © 2007 CPS and SIMM.

34948899771	Aberrant chromatin remodeling by retinole acid receptor α fusion proteins assessed at the single-cell level	Acute promyelocyte leukemia (APL) is characterized by specific chromosomal translocations, which generate fusion proteins such as promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor (RAR)α and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARα (X-RARα). In this study, we have applied lac operator array systems to study the effects of X-RARα versus wild-type RARα on large-scale chromatin structure. The targeting of these enhanced cyan fluorescent protein-lac repressor-tagged RARα-containing proteins to the gene-amplification chromosomal region by lac operator repeats led to local chromatin condensation, recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressor, and histone deacetylase complex. The addition of retinoic acid (RA) induced large-scale chromatin decondensation in cells expressing RARα; however, cells expressing X-RARα, especially PML-RARα, demonstrated insensitive response to this effect of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Although we did not reveal differences in RA-dependent colocalization of either silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid or steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-1 with RARα versus X-RARα, the hormone-independent association between SRC-1 and X-RARα on the array has been identified. Rather, compared with cells expressing RARα, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of live transfected cells, demonstrated decreased mobility of SRC-1 on the X-RARα-bound chromatin. Thus, the impaired ability of APL fusion proteins to activate gene transcription in response to ATRA corresponds to their reduced ability to remodel chromatin, which may link to their ability to impair the mobility of key nuclear receptor coregulators. © 2007 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

36248959806	Combined effects of histone deacetylase inhibitor and rituximab on non-Hodgkin's B-lymphoma cells apoptosis	Objective: The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab has shown promising results in the clinical treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). However, its therapeutic effect could still be improved. Methods: This study examined the anti-tumor activity of rituximab combined with histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in CD20-positive B-NHL cell lines, as well as in primary B-NHL cells and a murine B-NHL model. Results: The combination treatment sensitized B-NHL cells to apoptosis in a synergistic manner, concomitant with mitochondrial instability and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL downregulation. Particularly in Daudi cells relatively resistant to rituximab, these events were associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) inactivation and c-Myc degradation. SAHA presented functional complementation with rituximab, through decreasing IKKα/β and IκBα phosphorylation, thus preventing NF-κB nuclear translocation. In addition, SAHA induced IκBα cleavage to a stable inhibitory form and caused NF-κB degradation in response to caspase-3 activation. More importantly, rituximab-SAHA combination significantly promoted primary B-NHL cells apoptosis and improved survival time of a severe combined immunodeficient mouse lymphoma model established with intravenous injection of Daudi cells. Conclusion: These findings emphasized the value of targeting apoptosis signaling pathway in lymphoma therapy. Rituximab in conjunction with histone deacetylase inhibitor may represent a novel strategy in treating patients with B-NHL. © 2007 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

35948964893	The cdx genes and retinoic acid control the positioning and segmentation of the zebrafish pronephros	Kidney function depends on the nephron, which comprises a blood filter, a tubule that is subdivided into functionally distinct segments, and a collecting duct. How these regions arise during development is poorly understood. The zebrafish pronephros consists of two linear nephrons that develop from the intermediate mesoderm along the length of the trunk. Here we show that, contrary to current dogma, these nephrons possess multiple proximal and distal tubule domains that resemble the organization of the mammalian nephron. We examined whether pronephric segmentation is mediated by retinoic acid (RA) and the caudal (cdx) transcription factors, which are known regulators of segmental identity during development. Inhibition of RA signaling resulted in a loss of the proximal segments and an expansion of the distal segments, while exogenous RA treatment induced proximal segment fates at the expense of distal fates. Loss of cdx function caused abrogation of distal segments, a posterior shift in the position of the pronephros, and alterations in the expression boundaries of raldh2 and cyp26a1, which encode enzymes that synthesize and degrade RA, respectively. These results suggest that the cdx genes act to localize the activity of RA along the axis, thereby determining where the pronephros forms. Consistent with this, the pronephric-positioning defect and the loss of distal tubule fate were rescued in embryos doubly-deficient for cdx and RA. These findings reveal a novel link between the RA and cdx pathways and provide a model for how pronephric nephrons are segmented and positioned along the embryonic axis. © 2007 Wingert et al.

0032753565	Differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid: 10-year experience of its clinical application	Purpose. To summarize the experiences in using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the differentiation therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) since our introduction of its use in clinic in 1986. Data resources. Data resources came from Chinese Journal of Hematology, English-language literature using MEDLINE (1988 - 1998), book entitled 'Treatment of Malignancies by Inducing Differentiation and Apoptosis' published by Shanghai Publishing House on Sciences and Technology, and our recent data to be published. Study selection. Thirty-five articles related to the purpose of this review were reviewed. Data extraction. Data were checked for their quality, reliance and originality. Results. ATRA combined with chemotherapy can decrease the incidence of retinoic acid syndrome and produce a very high remission rate (90% - 95%). Post-remission treatment should include chemotherapy and ATRA, the 5-year survival probability was able to attain 0.71±0.06. The main problem in the treatment is early tolerance to ATRA and relapse of the disease. The most effective treatments for relapsed APL is to use arsenic trioxide. Conclusion. The combination of ATRA, chemotherapy and arsenic oxide in the treatment of APL for elevating the remission rate and prolonging survival time deserves further study.

0032933077	Chromosomal aberrations during progression of chronic myeloid leukemia identified by cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic tools: Implication of 1q12-21	To study the genomic abnormality underlying the acute transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 15 CML patients in blast crisis (BC), 3 in accelerated phase (AP), and 20 in chronic phase (CP) were analyzed by conventional cytogenetics, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), and dual- color chromosomal painting. Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome was identified in every case studied. Only 5 among 20 CP patients had additional abnormalities while 13 of 18 patients with disease progression (BC + AP) showed extra numerical and/or structural chromosomal aberrations. Cytogenetically, the most common chromosome gains during BC and AP were double or triple Ph chromosomes (5 of 14 cases) and trisomy 8 (5 of 14 cases). Trisomies 7 and 17 (1 of 14 cases each) were also observed. CGH analysis detected genetic imbalances in eight cases. Gains of chromosome 20 (3 cases) and 17q (2 cases) were observed, respectively. The recurrent chromosome loss was the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17, seen in one case with i(17)(q10) and one case with an unbalanced translocation (1;17). In one case, a very complex chromosomal rearrangement, del(3),del(6),der(6)t(17;3;6),der(17)t(6;17), was seen. A novel finding of this work is the involvement of chromosome 1(q12- 21qter) in CML disease progression. Overrepresentation of 1(q12-21qter) region was detected by CGH in one case which had a derivative chromosome 17. This abnormal chromosome was later confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) painting to be a fusion between chromosome 1 and 17 to form the der(17)t(1;17) (q12-21;p11). Two other cases showed the same region being involved in translocations, t(1;10)(q12-21;q26) and t(1;11)(q12- 21;p15). It is possible that one or more genes residing on chromosome 1q12- 21 may be important in the acute transformation of CML. In conclusion, we find that the combined use of CGH, chromosome painting, and classic cytogenetic analysis allows a better evaluation of the genomic aberration involved in CML blastic transformation, and offers new directions for its further molecular investigations.

0033782920	Cloning and functional analysis of cDNAs with open reading frames for 300 previously undefined genes expressed in CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells	Three hundred cDNAs containing putatively entire open reading frames (ORFs) for previously undefined genes were obtained from CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), based on EST cataloging, clone sequencing, in silico cloning, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The cDNA sizes ranged from 360 to 3496 bp and their ORFs coded for peptides of 58-752 amino acids. Public database search indicated that 225 cDNAs exhibited sequence similarities to genes identified across a variety of species. Homology analysis led to the recognition of 50 basic structural motifs/domains among these cDNAs. Genomic exon-intron organization could be established in 243 genes by integration of cDNA data with genome sequence information. Interestingly, a new gene named as HSPC070 on 3p was found to share a sequence of 105bp in 3' UTR with RAF gene in reversed transcription orientation. Chromosomal localizations were obtained using electronic mapping for 192 genes and with radiation hybrid (RH) for 38 genes. Macroarray technique was applied to screen the gene expression patterns in five hematopoietic cell lines (NB4, HL60, U937, K562, and Jurkat) and a number of genes with differential expression were found. The resource work has provided a wide range of information useful not only for expression genomics and annotation of genomic DNA sequence, but also for further research on the function of genes involved in hematopoietic development and differentiation.

0033827097	Mechanisms of all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells	Retinoic acids (RA) play a key role in myeloid differentiation through their agonistic nuclear receptors (RARα/RXR) to modulate the expression of target genes. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells with rearrangement of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) (including: PML-RARα, PLZF-RARα, NPM-RARα, NuMA-RARα or STAT5b-RARα) as a result of chromosomal translocations, the RA signal pathway is disrupted and myeloid differentiation is arrested at the promyelocytic stage. Pharmacologic dosage of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) directly modulates PML-RARα and its interaction with the nuclear receptor co-repressor complex, which restores the wild-type RARα/RXR regulatory pathway and induces the transcriptional expression of down-stream genes. Analysing gene expression profiles in APL cells before and after ATRA treatment represents a useful approach to identify genes whose functions are involved in this new cancer treatment. A chronologically well coordinated modulation of ATRA-regulated genes has thus been revealed which seems to constitute a balanced functional network underlying decreased cellular proliferation, initiation and progression of maturation, and maintenance of cell survival before terminal differentiation.

31944450654	Linkage disequilibrium sharing and haplotype-tagged SNP portability between populations	The discovery of the block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in human populations holds the promise of delineating the etiology of common diseases. However, understanding the magnitude, mechanism, and utility of between-population LD sharing is critical for future genome-wide association studies. In this study, substantial LD sharing between six non-African populations was observed, although much less between African-American and non-African, based on 20,000 SNPs of chromosome 21. We also demonstrated the respective roles of recombination and demographic events in shaping LD sharing. Furthermore, we showed that the haplotype-tagged SNPs chosen from one population are portable to the others in East Asia. Therefore, we concluded that the magnitude of LD sharing between human populations justifies the use of representative populations for selecting haplotypetagged SNPs in genome-wide association studies of complex diseases. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

41149169150	Gain-of-function mutation of GATA-2 in acute myeloid transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia	Acquisition of additional genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities other than the BCR/ABL fusion gene is believed to cause disease progression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from chronic phase to blast crisis (BC). To gain insights into the underlying mechanisms of progression to BC, we screened DNA samples from CML patients during blast transformation for mutations in a number of transcription factor genes that are critical for myeloid-lymphoid development. In 85 cases of CML blast transformation, we identified two new mutations in the coding region of GATA-2, a negative regulator of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell differentiation. A L359V substitution within zinc finger domain (ZF) 2 of GATA-2 was found in eight cases with myelomonoblastic features, whereas an in-frame deletion of 6 aa (Δ341-346) spanning the C-terminal border of ZF1 was detected in one patient at myeloid BC with eosinophilia. Further studies indicated that L359V not only increased transactivation activity of GATA-2 but also enhanced its inhibitory effects on the activity of PU.1, a major regulator of myelopoiesis. Consistent with the myelomonoblastic features of CML transformation with the GATA-2 L359V mutant, transduction of the GATA-2 L359V mutant into HL-60 cells or BCR/ABL-harboring murine cells disturbed myelomonocytic differentiation/proliferation in vitro and in vivo, respectively. These data strongly suggest that GATA-2 mutations may play a role in acute myeloid transformation in a subset of CML patients. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

60549113021	Preliminary structural and functional study on a novel gene HSPCSET	Objective: To characterize the structural and the functional feature of a novel gene HSPCSET isolated from human CD34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs). Methods: Bioinformatic technology was used to identify the structural features of the HSPCSET protein and perform the multiple sequence alignment. Yeast-two-hybrid system was used to identify the proteins interacting with the HSPCSET protein. After sequencing, we selected out the positive clones which had clear functions, and carried out β-gal experiment and GST pull down assay to confirm the results. The cellular location of the HSPCSET was checked by immunofluorescence assay. Results: The HSPCSET protein belongs to a SET domain family, which is evolutionarily conserved across species. It implied that HSPCSET may have biologically important function. Using yeast-two-hybrid system, we showed that the protein sequence with SET domain might bind to 13 proteins, which involved in signaling transduction, transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, tumorigenesis, development, etc. And 4 proteins (GADD34, SIVA, DNAJ and PHF1) were confirmed by one-on-one back of the hybrid experiment, β-gal test and GST pull down assay. When GADD34 and HSPCSET were co-transfected, they co-localized in the nucleus, suggesting a strong interaction. Conclusion: The novel gene HSPCSET is likely to have biologically important function. This study provides the basis for further studies of its function in hematopoiesis and tumorigenesis.

Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid results in complete remission in 92-95% of patients with this disease. Using the recently advocated combination of all-trans-retinoic acid and chemotherapy, adverse effects such as retinoic acid syndrome have decreased, and long-term survival has improved. Chemotherapy in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid seems to be the best postremission treatment protocol, with a 5-year relapse-free survival rate of 50-60%.

77954720766	An evolutionarily conserved PTEN-C/EBPα-CTNNA1 axis controls myeloid development and transformation	Loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, CEBPA, and CTNNA1 (encoding the α-catenin protein), has been found to play an essential role in leukemogenesis. However, whether these genes genetically interact remains largely unknown. Here, we show that PTEN-mammalian target of rapamycin signaling acts upstream to dictate the ratio of wild-type p42 C/EBPα to its dominant-negative p30 isoform, which critically determines whether p30 C/EBPα (lower p42/p30 ratio) or p42 C/EBPα (higher p42/p30 ratio) binds to the proximal promoter of the retained CTNNA1 allele. Binding of p30 C/EBPα recruits the polycomb repressive complex 2 to suppress CTNNA1 transcription through repressive H3K27me3 modification, whereas binding of p42 C/EBPα relieves this repression and promotes CTNNA1 expression through activating H3K4me3 modification. Loss of Pten function in mice and zebrafish induces myelodysplasia with abnormal invasiveness of myeloid progenitors accompanied by significant reductions in both wild-type C/EBPα and α-catenin protein. Importantly, frame-shift mutations in either PTEN or CEBPA were detected exclusively in the primary LICs with low CTNNA1 expression. This study uncovers a novel molecular pathway, PTEN-C/EBPα-CTNNA1, which is evolutionarily conserved and might be therapeutically targeted to eradicate LICs with low CTNNA1 expression. © 2010 by The American Society of Hematology.

79952286086	C-KIT mutation cooperates with full-length AML1-ETO to induce acute myeloid leukemia in mice	The full-length AML1-ETO (AE) fusion gene resulting from t(8;21) (q22;q22) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not sufficient to induce leukemia in animals, suggesting that additional mutations are required for leukemogenesis. We and others have identified activating mutations of C-KIT in nearly half of patients with t (8;21) AML. To test the hypothesis that activating C-KIT mutations cooperate with AE to cause overt AML, we generated a murine transduction and transplantation model with both mutated C-KIT and AE. To overcome the intracellular transport block of human C-KIT in murine cells, we engineered hybrid C-KIT (HyC-KIT) by fusing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the murine c-Kit in-frame to the intracellular signaling domain of human C-KIT. We showed that tyrosine kinase domain mutants HyC-KIT N822K and D816V, as well as juxtamembrane mutants HyC-KIT 571+14 and 557-558Del, could transform murine 32D cells to cytokine-independent growth. The protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib inhibited the proliferation of 32D cells expressing these C-KIT mutants, with potency in the low nanomolar range. In mice, HyC-KIT N822K induced a myeloproliferative disease, whereas HyCKIT 571+14 induces both myeloproliferative disease and lymphocytic leukemia. Interestingly, coexpression of AE and HyC-KIT N822K led to fatal AML. Our data have further enriched the twohit model that abnormalities of both transcription factor and membrane/cytosolic signaling molecule are required in AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, dasatinib prolonged lifespan of mice bearing AE and HyC-KIT N822K-coexpressing leukemic cells and exerted synergic effects while combined with cytarabine, thus providing a potential therapeutic for t(8;21) leukemia.

41949111045	Acute promyelocytic leukemia: From highly fatal to highly curable	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a distinct subtype of acute myeloid leukemia. Morphologically, it is identified as the M3 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia by the French-American-British classification and cytogenetically is characterized by a balanced reciprocal trans- location between chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in the fusion between promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and retinoic acid receptor α (RARα). It seems that the disease is the most malignant form of acute leukemia with a severe bleeding tendency and a fatal course of only weeks. Chemotherapy (CT; daunorubicin, idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside) was the front-line treatment of APL with a complete remission (CR) rate of 75% to 80% in newly diagnosed patients. Despite all these progresses, the median duration of remission ranged from 11 to 25 months and only 35% to 45% of the patients could be cured by CT. Since the introduction of all-frans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment and optimization of the ATRA-based regimens, the CR rate was raised up to 90% to 95% and 5-year disease free survival (DFS) to 74%. The use of arsenic trioxide (ATO) since early 1990s further improved the clinical outcome of refractory or relapsed as well as newly diagnosed APL. In this article, we review the history of introduction of ATRA and ATO into clinical use and the mechanistic studies in understanding this model of cancer targeted therapy. © 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.

43549087444	PRDM1 is involved in chemoresistance of T-cell lymphoma and down-regulated by the proteasome inhibitor	The positive regulatory domain I (PRDM1) is a master regulator of terminal B-cell differentiation. However, PRDM1 is not B-cell specific. To determine its role in T-cell lymphoma, PRDM1 expression was investigated in 60 patients. PRDM1α and PRDM1β transcripts were detected in laser-microdissected T-lymphoma cells in 27 and 14 patients, respectively, mostly in cases with IRF4 expression. PRDM1β was associated with increased c-MYC ex-pression. PRDM1β-positive patients displayed advanced Ann Arbor stage and high-risk International Prognostic Index and were linked to short survival times. In vitro, PRDM1β was related to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and could be down-regulated by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Kinetic studies showed that bortezomib down-regulation of PRDM1β preceded decreased IRF4 and c-MYC expression. An earlier retaining of cytoplasmic IκBα in bortezomib-treated cells was revealed, concomitant with blockade of NF-κB nuclear translocation. These results demonstrate the involvement of PRDM1 β in T-cell lymphoma, with possible therapeutic interference by the proteasome inhibitor. © 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.

43749109183	Makorin-2 is a neurogenesis inhibitor downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) signal	Makorin-2 belongs to the makorin RING zinc finger gene family, which encodes putative ribonucleoproteins. Here we cloned the Xenopus makorin-2 (mkrn2) and characterized its function in Xenopus neurogenesis. Forced overexpression of mkrn2 produced tadpoles with dorso-posterior deficiencies and small-head/short-tail phenotype, whereas knockdown of mkrn2 by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides induced double axis in tadpoles. In Xenopus animal cap explant assay, mkrn2 inhibited activin, and retinoic acid induced animal cap neuralization, as evident from the suppression of a pan neural marker, neural cell adhesion molecule. Surprisingly, the anti-neurogenic activity of mkrn2 is independent of the two major neurogenesis signaling cascades, BMP-4 and Wnt8 pathways. Instead, mkrn2 works specifically through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt-mediated neurogenesis pathway. Overexpression of mkrn2 completely abrogated constitutively active PI3K- and Akt-induced, but not dominant negative glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)-induced, neural cell adhesion molecule expression, indicating that mkrn2 acts downstream of PI3K and Akt and upstream of GSK-3β. Moreover, mkrn2 up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of GSK-3β. These results revealed for the first time the important role of mkrn2 as a new player in PI3K/Akt-mediated neurogenesis during Xenopus embryonic development. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

44449088416	A new fusion gene NUP98-IQCG identified in an acute T-lymphoid/myeloid leukemia with a t(3;11)(q29q13;p15)del(3)(q29) translocation	NUP98 has been involved in multiple recurrent chromosome rearrangements in leukemia. We identified a novel fusion between NUP98 and IQ motif containing G (IQCG) gene from a de novo acute T-lymphoid/myeloid leukemia harboring t(3;11)(q29q13;p15)del(3)(q29). IQCG has two putative coiled-coil domains and one IQ domain. The FG repeat from NUP98 and the coiled-coil domain from IQCG were retained in the fusion protein. We demonstrated that NUP98-IQCG could form homodimer, heterodimerize with NUP98 or IQCG, bind co-activators and/or co-repressors, and show transcriptional activity in vitro. Expression of NUP98-IQCG inhibited 32Dcl3 cell apoptosis induced by Ara-C, and partially blocked granulocyte differentiation induced by G-CSF. Colony-forming assay and serial replating assays indicated that NUP98-IQCG was able to stimulate proliferation, partially block differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells but was unable to confer transformation alone. Taken together, our data indicate that newly identified NUP98-IQCG fusion protein may play an essential role in leukemogenesis, but by itself may not be sufficient to induce leukemia. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.

45149134029	Genome-wide survey and developmental expression mapping of zebrafish SET domain-containing genes	SET domain-containing proteins represent an evolutionarily conserved family of epigenetic regulators, which are responsible for most histone lysine methylation. Since some of these genes have been revealed to be essential for embryonic development, we propose that the zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism possessing many advantages for developmental studies, can be utilized to study the biological functions of these genes and the related epigenetic mechanisms during early development. To this end, we have performed a genome-wide survey of zebrafish SET domain genes. 58 genes total have been identified. Although gene duplication events give rise to several lineage-specific paralogs, clear reciprocal orthologous relationship reveals high conservation between zebrafish and human SET domain genes. These data were further subject to an evolutionary analysis ranginq from yeast to human, leading to the identification of putative clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) of this gene family. By means of whole-mount mRNA in situ hybridization strategy, we have also carried out a developmental expression mapping of these genes. A group of maternal SET domain genes, which are implicated in the programming of histone modification states in early development, have been identified and predicted to be responsible for all known sites of SET domain-mediated histone methylation. Furthermore, some genes show specific expression patterns in certain tissues at certain stages, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of these systems. These results provide a global view of zebrafish SET domain histone methyltransferases in evolutionary and developmental dimensions and pave the way for using zebrafish to systematically study the roles of these genes during development. © 2008 Sun et al.

47549107415	Relationship between atmospheric pollution processes and synoptic pressure patterns in northern China	The air pollution index (API) sequences in 10 cities in northern China and the synoptic pressure patterns during autumn and winter from 2002 to 2006 were analyzed with diagnostic and statistical methods. The results showed that the air qualities in northern China had a prominent correlation with the pressure systems. It revealed that (a) the increasing phase of API was associated with high pressure and the successive low pressure, (b) the preceding part of front (i.e. the retral part of low pressure) was associated with the maximum of API values during a cycle of air pollution process, (c) the pressure systems with high gradient led to the decrease of API, and (d) the synoptic pressure patterns and their evolvements were the main causes of regional air pollution processes. These relations can be used to analyze the variation characteristics and mechanism of regional atmosphere pollution process, and provide important basis for the qualitative prediction, control, and management of regional air pollution problems. © 2008.

47749126938	eena promotes myeloid proliferation through stimulating ERK1/2 phosphorylation in zebrafish	The EEN (extra eleven nineteen) gene is one of the fusion partners of mixed-lineage leukemia, located on chromosome 19p13. Here we cloned two een genes (designated as eena and eenb) in zebrafish, which are assigned to linkage groups 8 and 2, respectively. Whole-mount in situ hybridization assay showed that eena and eenb have overlapping but distinct expression patterns during embryogenesis. Ubiquitous or targeted overexpression of eena, but not eenb, into wild-type or transgenic embryos (green fluorescent protein-labeled myeloid progenitors) induced a significant proliferation and ectopic distribution of myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. Using a morpholino antisense gene knockdown approach, we showed that the number of myeloid progenitors and their downstream mature myelomonocytic cells was significantly decreased in the eenadeficient embryos. Mechanistically, overexpression of eena selectively stimulated ERK phosphorylation and increased the level of transcription factor c-Fos in vitro and in vivo, whereas eena lacking the Src homology 3 domain completely abolished these effects. Furthermore, a MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, blocked the eena-induced cell proliferation and activation of ERK signaling. The results suggest that eena plays an important role in the development of the myeloid cell through activation of the ERK pathway and may provide a valuable reference for future studies of the role of EEN in leukemogenesis. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

48749094797	RIG-I plays a critical role in negatively regulating granulocytic proliferation	RIG-I has been implicated in innate immunity by sensing intracellular viral RNAs and inducing type I IFN production. However, we have found a significant RIG-I induction in a biological setting without active viral infection - namely, during RA-induced terminal granulocytic differentiation of acute myeloid leukemias. Here, we present evidence that a significant Rig-I induction also occurs during normal myelopoiesis and that the disruption of the Rig-I gene in mice leads to the development of a progressive myeloproliferative disorder. The initiation of progressive myeloproliferative disorder is mainly due to an intrinsic defect of Rig-I

51349099009	The four-and-a-half-LIM protein 2 (FHL2) is overexpressed in gliomas and associated with oncogenic activities	Four-and-a-half-LIM protein 2 (FHL2) is a member of FHL protein family, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, cell survival, and migration. Although its function in oncogenesis appears to be tumor type-specific, its roles in glioma formation and development are yet to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrated that the mRNA level of FHL2 was elevated in both low- and high-grade glioma samples. Overexpression of FHL2 stimulated the proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration of human glioblastoma cells. Conversely, FHL2 knockdown by short hairpin RNA (shRNA-FHL2) inhibited glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of FHL2 increased the tumorigenicity of glioblastoma cells in nude mice and decreased the mRNA levels of p53 and its downstream proapoptotic genes, including p21, Bcl2-associated protein X (Bax), and p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis. It also enhanced the promoter activities of activator protein-1 (AP-1), human telomerase reverse transcriptase, and survivin genes. Together, these results provide the first evidence that FHL2 contributes to glioma carcinogenesis. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

49649101876	In vivo interstitial migration of primitive macrophages mediated by JNK-matrix metalloproteinase 13 signaling in response to acute injury	Interstitial cell migration through extracellular matrix is a hallmark of the inflammation response, tumor invasion, and metastasis. We have established a stable zebrafish transgenic line expressing enhanced GFP under the lysozyme C promoter for visualizing and measuring primitive macrophage migration in vivo. We show that tissue-resident primitive macrophages migrate rapidly through extracellular matrix to the site of acute injury induced by tail transection. Mechanistically, the specific inhibition of JNK, but not p38 and ERK, dramatically abolished the chemotactic migration in a dose-dependent manner, suppressing the trauma-induced recruitment of phosphorylated C-Jun transcription factor to proximal AP-1 sites in the promoter of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (mmp13), a gene specifically expressed in primitive macrophages during embryogenesis and required for the interstitial migration. Furthermore, dexamethasone suppressed the trauma-induced JNK phosphorylation and macrophage migration accompanied by simultaneous up-regulation of mkp-1, a well-known phosphatase capable of inactivating phosphorylated JNK. The results indicate that the JNK-Mmp13 signaling pathway plays an essential role in regulating the innate immune cell migration in response to severe injury in vivo.

52149103982	Identification of protein ubiquitination by IP-2D nano-HPLC-MALDI-TOF-TOF	Mass spectrometry has been extensively used in the identification of protein and its posttranslational modification (PTM). Mass spectrometry coupled with nano high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) could improve its resolution and efficiency. Ubiquitination, one kind of the important protein posttranslational modifications (PTM), plays a pivotal role in dynamic balance and functional regulation of protein. A new strategy taking the advantage of immunoprecipitation, 2D nano HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was established to identify the ubiquitination of endogenous protein in mammalian cells. By using this strategy, the ubiquitinated sites of c-ABL in K562 leukemia cells was successfully identified. Thus, it may provide a valuable tool to characterizing the ubiquitination of endogenous proteins under physiologic and pathologic conditions.

Methods: The present researchers established a cDNA microarray platform and applied component plane presentation integrated self-organizing map (CPP-SOM) to the microarray data obtained from a differentiation model, all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation in NB4 cells. Results: The platform included 12 630 unique clones, including 9436 known genes. By CPP-SOM, the researchers were able to not only well classify the regulated genes into functionally distinct categories but also depict transcriptional changes throughout the process of the development of diseases or drug treatment. Conclusion: The platform has proven to be steady and reliable, and the CPP-SOM could serve as an important and good tool for analysis of microarray data.

60849131761	Mir-144 selectively regulates embryonic {alpha}-hemoglobin synthesis during primitive erythropoiesis	Precise transcriptional control of developmental stage-specific expression and switching of α- and β-globin genes is significantly important to understand the general principles controlling gene expression and the pathogenesis of thalassemia. Although transcription factors regulating β-globin genes have been identified, little is known about the micro-RNAs and trans-acting mechanism controlling α-globin genes transcription. Here, we show that an erythroid lineage-specific microRNA gene, miR-144, expressed at specific developmental stages during zebrafish embryogenesis, negatively regulates the embryonic α-globin, but not embryonic β-globin, gene expression, through physiologically targeting klfd, an erythroid-specific Krüppel-like transcription factor. Klfd selectively binds to the CACCC boxes in the promoters of both α-globin and miR-144 genes to activate their transcriptions, thus forming a negative feedback circuitry to fine-tune the expression of embryonic α-globin gene. The selective effect of the miR-144-Klfd pathway on globin gene regulation may thereby constitute a novel therapeutic target for improving the clinical outcome of patients with thalassemia. © 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.

From April 2001, we have followed 85 patients administrated ATRA/ATO with a median follow-up of 70 months. Eighty patients (94.1%) entered complete remission (CR). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for all patients were 89.2% ± 3.4% and 91.7% ± 3.0%, respectively, and the 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS for patients who achieved CR (n = 80) were 94.8% ± 2.5% and 97.4% ± 1.8%, respectively. Upon ATRA/ATO, prognosis was not influenced by initial white blood cell count, distinct PML-RARα types, or FLT3 mutations. The toxicity profile was mild and reversible. No secondary carcinoma was observed, and 24 months after the last dose of ATRA/ATO, patients had urine arsenic concentrations well below the safety limit. These results demonstrate the high efficacy and minimal toxicity of ATRA/ATO treatment for newly diagnosed APL in long-term follow-up, suggesting a potential frontline therapy for de novo APL. © 2009 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

62949085517	Experimental validation and complexity of miRNA-mRNA target interaction during zebrafish primitive erythropoiesis	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-protein coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in animals and plants by binding to target transcripts for cleavage or translational repression. Despite increasing number of genes has been predicted to be miRNA targets by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase-based reporter assay in vitro (RA-In Vitro), few of them have been experimentally validated in physiological context. Using transient reporter assay in vivo (TRA-In Vivo), we identified hydroxymethylbilane synthase b (hmbsb) and Krüppel-like transcription factor d (klfd) as potential target gene for miR-451 and miR-144, respectively. Although hmbsb, miR-451, klfd and miR-144 are all co-expressed in the developing erythroid progenitors during zebrafish erythropoiesis, only klfd can be validated as a bona fide physiological target of miR-144 using a transgene-based physiological reporter assay in vivo (PRA-In Vivo). Thus, failure to verify hmbsb as miR-451 target in physiological context raises a crucial question as to how to determine bona fide target of miRNA. The results address the importance of using multiple approaches combined with Western blot analysis to validate the physiological target of a given miRNA. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

65949099540	Ifr-9/stat2 functional interaction drives Retinoic acid-induced gene g expression independently of stat1	Retinoic acid-induced gene G (RIG-G), a gene originally identified in all-trans retinoic acid-treated NB4 acute promyelocyte leukemia cells, is also induced by IFNα in various hematopoietic and solid tumor cells. Our previous work showed that RIG-G possessed a potent antiproliferative activity. However, the mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of RIG-G gene remains unknown. Here, we report that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 2 together with IFN regulatory factor (IKF)-9 can effectively drive the transcription of RIG-G gene by their functional interaction through a STATl-independent manner, even without the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2. The complex IRF-9/STAT2 is both necessary and sufficient for RIG-G gene expression. In addition, IRF-1 is also able to induce RIG-G gene expression through an IRF-9/STAT2-dependent or IRF-9/ STAT2-independent mechanism. Moreover, the induction of RIG-G by retinoic acid in NB4 cells resulted, to some extent, from an IFNot autocrine pathway, a finding that suggests a novel mechanism for the signal cross-talk between IFNα. and retinoic acid. Taken together, our results provide for the first time the evidence of the biological significance of IRF-9/STAT2 complex, and furnish an alternative pathway modulating the expression of IFN-stimulated genes, contributing to the diversity of IFN signaling to mediate their multiple biological properties in normal and tumor cells. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.

67650786530	The Schistosoma japonicum genome reveals features of host-parasite interplay	Schistosoma japonicum is a parasitic flatworm that causes human schistosomiasis, which is a significant cause of morbidity in China and the Philippines. Here we present a draft genomic sequence for the worm. The genome provides a global insight into the molecular architecture and host interaction of this complex metazoan pathogen, revealing that it can exploit host nutrients, neuroendocrine hormones and signalling pathways for growth, development and maturation. Having a complex nervous system and a well-developed sensory system, S. japonicum can accept stimulation of the corresponding ligands as a physiological response to different environments, such as fresh water or the tissues of its intermediate and mammalian hosts. Numerous proteases, including cercarial elastase, are implicated in mammalian skin penetration and haemoglobin degradation.

67650888562	Synergy between proteasome inhibitors and imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia	Background: Resistance developed by leukemic cells, unsatisfactory efficacy on patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at accelerated and blastic phases, and potential cardiotoxity, have been limitations for imatinib mesylate (IM) in treating CML. Whether low dose IM in combination with agents of distinct but related mechanisms could be one of the strategies to overcome these concerns warrants careful investigation. Methods and Findings: We tested the therapeutic efficacies as well as adverse effects of low dose IM in combination with proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (BOR) or proteasome inhibitor I (PSI), in two CML murine models, and investigated possible mechanisms of action on CML cells. Our results demonstrated that low dose IM in combination with BOR exerted satisfactory efficacy in prolongation of life span and inhibition of tumor growth in mice, and did not cause cardiotoxicity or body weight loss. Consistently, BOR and PSI enhanced IM-induced inhibition of long-term clonogenic activity and short-term cell growth of CML stem/ progenitor cells, and potentiated IM-caused inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of BCR-ABL+ cells. IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited Bcl-2, increased cytoplasmic cytochrome C, and activated caspases. While exerting suppressive effects on BCR-ABL, E2F1, and β-catenin, IM/BOR and IM/PSI inhibited proteasomal degradation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to a re-activation of this important negative regulator of BCR-ABL. In addition, both combination therapties inhibited Bruton's tyrosine kinase via suppression of NFκB. Conclusion: These data suggest that combined use of tyrosine kinase inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor might be helpful for optimizing CML treatment. © 2009 Hu et al.

Co-exposure of cells to bortezomib and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) synergistically induces T-leukemia/lymphoma cells to undergo apoptosis, consistent with a significant increase in mitochondrial injury and caspase activation. These events are accompanied by inhibition of cyto-protective signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, Raf-1/ mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and AKT pathways, and activation of stress-related cascades, including the stress-activated kinases c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Moreover, bortezomib in conjunction with SAHA efficiently induces apoptosis of primary T-leukemia/lymphoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in a murine xenograft model established with subcutaneous injection of Jurkat cells. Taken together, these findings confirm the synergistic anti-tumor effect of the proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors, and provide an insight into the future clinical applications of bortezomib-SAHA combining regimen in treating T-cell malignancies.

In the meantime, the contribution of each natural factor, i. e., rainfall, soil texture, slope, and elevation, was analyzed, and a new approach, overlapping and ordering method, was developed to identify the key affecting factors in the given sensitive areas. In the study area, soil erosion was mainly at non-sensitive and low sensitive levels. The percentages of the areas with different soil erosion sensitivity varied with the strength of the affecting factors. Soil erosion sensitivity increased with increasing rainfall and slope, and the percentage of the area with high soil erosion sensitivity was the largest at elevation 200-500 meters. The overlapping and ordering method was a practicable approach in identifying the key affecting factors in given sensitive areas, being helpful to understand the mechanisms causing soil erosion.

Its spliced variant transcript, AML1-ETO9a, rapidly induces leukemia in murine model. To evaluate its clinical significance, AML1-ETO9a expression was assessed in 118 patients with t(8;21) AML-M2, using qualitative and nested quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR methods. These cases were accordingly divided into the AML1-ETO9a-H group (n=86, positive for qualitative RT-PCR, with higher level of AML1-ETO9a by quantitative RT-PCR) and the AML1-ETO9a-L group (n=32, negative for qualitative RT-PCR, with lower but still detectable level of AML1-ETO9a by quantitative RT-PCR). C-KIT expression was significantly increased in the AML1-ETO9a-H group, as compared with the AML1-ETO9a-L group. Of the 36 patients harboring C-KIT mutations, 32 patients overexpressed AML1-ETO9a (P=0.0209). Clinically, AML1-ETO9a-H patients exhibited significantly elevated white blood cells count, less bone marrow aberrant myelocytes, increased CD56 but decreased CD19 expression (P=0.0451, P=0.0479, P=0.0149 and P=0.0298, respectively). Moreover, AML1-ETO9a overexpression was related to short event-free and overall survival time (P=0.0072 and P=0.0076, respectively). Taken together, these data suggest that AML1-ETO9a is correlated with C-KIT overexpression/mutations and indicates poor disease outcome in t(8;21) AML-M2. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

76449095017	Small ubiquitin-related modifier paralogs are indispensable but functionally redundant during early development of zebrafish	The Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) conjugation to a variety of proteins regulates diverse cellular processes, including transcription, cell cycle regulation and maintenance of genome integrity. To investigate in vivo biological function of SUMO paralogs, we inactivated them in the early development of zebrafish. While zebrafish embryos deficient for all three SUMO paralogs, as Ubc9-deficient ones, displayed severe defects, loss of individual SUMO paralog was compatible with a normal development. SUMO-deficient embryos can be rescued by a single human or zebrafish SUMO. While key structural basic lysine residues and N-terminal unstructured stretch of SUMO are critical for in vivo rescue, the consensus K11 sumoylation site of SUMO2 is dispensable, implying that chain formation on this potential site is unessential for normal development. Inactivation of all three SUMOs triggered p53-dependent apoptosis and further inactivation of p53 restored normal zebrafish development. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that the dominant negative truncated form of p53, Δ113p53, significantly blunts SUMO depletion-induced p53 activity in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that SUMO paralogs are indispensable, but redundant, in the early development of zebrafish. © 2010 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

76649138304	Using sound clinical paths and diagnosis-related groups (DRGs)-based payment reform to bring benefits to patient care: A case study of leukemia therapy	China has been undertaking a profound reform on health care. Although more than 1.16 billion people have been covered by rural and urban medical insurance to date, the level of reimbursement from insurance is very limited, especially for critical diseases such as leukemia. This places heavy economic burdens on patients. Under these circumstances, systems innovation is imperative for the efficient utilization of limited funding. In this respect, certain valuable experience from other countries may prove helpful. The prospective payment system of Diagnosis-related Groups (DRGs), Clinical Paths, and the Comparative Effectiveness Analysis adopted by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, UK), can be fine tools to reduce medical costs and improve quality of services. Treatments of acute promyelocytic leukemia at Rui-Jin Hospital, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at Shanghai Children's Medical Center, can be taken as suitable models to illustrate the crucial role of Clinical Paths in guaranteeing clinical and cost effectiveness of medical services for critical diseases, and to satisfactorily justify the feasibility of DRGs in China. © 2010 Higher Education Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

In this study, we further investigated its effect and mechanism of action in human lymphoma. Materials and Methods: In vitro, a series of B- and T-lymphoma cells were treated with EriB. Cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometric assay. Expression of proteins related to apoptosis and cell signal transduction were assessed using Western blot. In vivo antitumor activity of EriB was examined in murine xenograft B- and T-lymphoma models, with in situ cell apoptosis detected by terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick-end labeling assay. Results: EriB significantly inhibited lymphoma cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in association with caspase activation. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were downregulated, with proapoptotic member Bax stable or upregulated, resulting in reduced Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl-xL/Bax ratios. Meanwhile, multiple signal transduction pathways were involved in lymphoma cell apoptosis in response to EriB, including inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and AKT pathways, and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway. AKT inactivation was related to increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21, decreased expression of antiapoptotic phosphorylated form of Bad, and NF-κB activator IκB kinase α/β. ERK activation corresponded to reactive oxygen species production and could be blocked by antioxidant dithiothreitol. In murine xenograft lymphoma models, EriB remarkably inhibited tumor growth and induced in situ tumor cell apoptosis.

77649258369	PML/RARα fusion protein transactivates the tissue factor promoter through a GAGC-containing element without direct DNA association	A severe coagulopathy is a life-threatening complication of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is ascribable mainly to the excessive levels of tissue factor (TF) in APL cells regulated in response to the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor α (PML/RARα) fusion protein. The underlying molecular mechanisms for this regulation remain ill-defined. With U937-PR9 cell lines stably expressing luciferase reporter gene under the control of different mutants of the TF promoter, both luciferase and ChIP data allowed the localization of the PML/RARα-responsive sequence in a previously undefined region of the TF promoter at position -230 to -242 devoid of known mammalian transcription factor binding sites. Within this sequence a GAGC motif (-235 to-238) was shown to be crucial because deletion or mutation of these nucleotides impaired both PML/RARα interaction and promoter transactivation. However, EMSA results showed that PML/RARα did not bind to DNA probes encompassing the -230 to -242 sequences, precluding a direct DNA association. Mutational experiments further suggest that the activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites of the TF promoter are dispensable for PML/RARα regulation. This study shows that PML/RARα transactivates the TF promoter through an indirect interaction with an element composed of a GAGC motif and the flanking nucleotides, independent of AP-1 binding.

76249120854	PML/RARα Targets Promoter Regions Containing PU.1 Consensus and RARE Half Sites in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia	PML/RARα is of crucial importance in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) both pathologically and therapeutically. Using a genome-wide approach, we identified in vivo PML/RARα binding sites in a PML/RARα-inducible cell model. Of the 2979 targeted regions, >62% contained canonical PU.1 motifs and >84% of these PU.1 motifs coexisted with one or more RARE half (RAREh) sites in nearby regions. Promoters with such PU.1-RAREh binding sites were transactivated by PU.1. PU.1-mediated transactivation was repressed by PML/RARα and restored by the addition of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Genes containing such promoters were significantly represented by genes transcriptionally suppressed in APL and/or reactivated upon treatment with ATRA. Thus, selective targeting of PU.1-regulated genes by PML/RARα is a critical mechanism for the pathogenesis of APL. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

77249114731	Setdb2 restricts dorsal organizer territory and regulates left-right asymmetry through suppressing fgf8 activity	Dorsal organizer formation is one of the most critical steps in early embryonic development. Several genes and signaling pathways that positively regulate the dorsal organizer development have been identified; however, little is known about the factor(s) that negatively regulates the organizer formation. Here, we show that Setdb2, a SET domain-containing protein possessing potential histone H3K9 methyltransferase activity, restricts dorsal organizer development and regulates left-right asymmetry by suppressing fibroblast growth factor 8 (fgf8) expression. Knockdown of Setdb2 results in a massive expansion of dorsal organizer markers floating head (flh), goosecoid (gsc), and chordin (chd), as well as a significant increase of fgf8, but not fgf4 mRNAs. Consequently, disrupted midline patterning and resultant randomization of left-right asymmetry are observed in Setdb2-deficient embryos. These characteristic changes induced by Setdb2 deficiency can be nearly corrected by either overexpression of a dominant-negative fgf receptor or knockdown of fgf8, suggesting an essential role for Setdb2-Fgf8 signaling in restricting dorsal organizer territory and regulating left-right asymmetry. These results provide unique evidence that a SET domain-containing protein potentially involved in the epigenetic control negatively regulates dorsal organizer formation during early embryonic development.

77953397764	Systems medicine: The future of medical genomics and healthcare	High-throughput technologies for DNA sequencing and for analyses of transcriptomes, proteomes and metabolomes have provided the foundations for deciphering the structure, variation and function of the human genome and relating them to health and disease states. The increased efficiency of DNA sequencing opens up the possibility of analyzing a large number of individual genomes and transcriptomes, and complete reference proteomes and metabolomes are within reach using powerful analytical techniques based on chromatography, mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Computational and mathematical tools have enabled the development of systems approaches for deciphering the functional and regulatory networks underlying the behavior of complex biological systems. Further conceptual and methodological developments of these tools are needed for the integration of various data types across the multiple levels of organization and time frames that are characteristic of human development, physiology and disease. Medical genomics has attempted to overcome the initial limitations of genome-wide association studies and has identified a limited number of susceptibility loci for many complex and common diseases. Iterative systems approaches are starting to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of human diseases, and to facilitate the development of better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer and many other diseases. Systems approaches will transform the way drugs are developed through academy-industry partnerships that will target multiple components of networks and pathways perturbed in diseases. They will enable medicine to become predictive, personalized, preventive and participatory, and, in the process, concepts and methods from Western and oriental cultures can be combined. We recommend that systems medicine should be developed through an international network of systems biology and medicine centers dedicated to inter-disciplinary training and education, to help reduce the gap in healthcare between developed and developing countries. © 2009 BioMed Central Ltd.

77958510339	Acute promyelocytic leukaemia: Novel insights into the mechanisms of cure	The fusion oncogene, promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) ĝ€"retinoic acid receptor-Î ± (RARA), initiates acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) through both a block to differentiation and increased self-renewal of leukaemic progenitor cells. The current standard of care is retinoic acid (RA) and chemotherapy, but arsenic trioxide also cures many patients with APL, and an RA plus arsenic trioxide combination cures most patients. This Review discusses the recent evidence that reveals surprising new insights into how RA and arsenic trioxide cure this leukaemia, by targeting PMLg-RARα ± for degradation. Drug-triggered oncoprotein degradation may be a strategy that is applicable to many cancers. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

78349261845	Genetic variations of DNA repair genes and their prognostic significance in patients with acute myeloid leukemia	Common genetic variations in genes involved in DNA repair or response to genotoxic stress may influence both cancer susceptibility and treatment response individually or interactively. However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the relevance of these genetic variations remains to be fully established. In this study, we analyzed 42 genetic variations among 15 candidate genes in 307 AML patients and 560 age-sex matched controls. Their associations with chemotherapy response were further evaluated in combination with other well-established prognostic factors. An increased risk of AML was found in individuals heterozygous for XPD 2251A>C (rs13181) with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.637 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.118 2.395), and the increased risk could be attributed to C allele (OR = 1.505, 95% CI: 1.061 2.134). Postchemotherapy response analysis revealed that AML patients heterozygous for ATM 4138C>T (rs3092856) or GG homozygous for TP53 215C>G (rs1042522) were independently linked to inferior treatment outcomes. These results uncover novel prognostic factors for AML patients treated with chemotherapy and may also indicate an etiological role of XPD in this disease. © 2010 UICC.

78650740077	As4S4 targets RING-type E3 ligase c-CBL to induce degradation of BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia	Arsenic, a curative agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, induces cell apoptosis and degradation of BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We demonstrated that ubiquitination and degradation of BCR-ABLwas mediated by c-CBL, a RING-type E3 ligase that was also shown to be involved in ubiquitination for many other receptor/protein tyrosine kinases. Our data showed that c-CBL protein was considerably up-regulated by arsenic sulfide (As4S4). Interestingly, arsenic directly bound the RING finger domain of c-CBL to inhibit its self-ubiquitination/degradation without interfering with the enhancement of ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis of its substrate BCR-ABL. Degradation of BCR-ABL due to c-CBL induction as a result of arsenic treatment was also observed in vivo in CML mice. These findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of arsenic and further support its therapeutic applications in CML in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and potentially also in other malignancies involving aberrant receptor/ protein tyrosine kinase signaling.

79952133903	RA-inducible gene-I induction augments STAT1 activation to inhibit leukemia cell proliferation	RA-inducible gene I (RIG-I/DDX58) has been shown to activate IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) on recognizing cytoplasmic viral RNAs. It is unclear how RIG-I functions within the IFN and/or RA signaling process in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, however, where obvious RIG-I induction is observed. Here, we show that the RIG-I induction functionally contributes to IFN-α plus RA-triggered growth inhibition of AML cells. Interestingly, although RIG-I induction itself is under the regulation of STAT1, a major IFN intracellular signal mediator, under circumstances in which it does not stimulate IPS-1, it conversely augments STAT1 activation to induce IFN-stimulatory gene expression and inhibit leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, our results unveil a previously undescribed RIG-I activity in regulating the cellular proliferation of leukemia cells via STAT1, which is independent of its classic role of sensing viral invasion to trigger type I IFN transcription.

79953176952	Exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3A in acute monocytic leukemia	Abnormal epigenetic regulation has been implicated in oncogenesis. We report here the identification of somatic mutations by exome sequencing in acute monocytic leukemia, the M5 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M5). We discovered mutations in DNMT3A (encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A) in 23 of 112 (20.5%) cases. The DNMT3A mutants showed reduced enzymatic activity or aberrant affinity to histone H3 in vitro. Notably, there were alterations of DNA methylation patterns and/or gene expression profiles (such as HOXB genes) in samples with DNMT3A mutations as compared with those without such changes. Leukemias with DNMT3A mutations constituted a group of poor prognosis with elderly disease onset and of promonocytic as well as monocytic predominance among AML-M5 individuals. Screening other leukemia subtypes showed Arg882 alterations in 13.6% of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) cases. Our work suggests a contribution of aberrant DNA methyltransferase activity to the pathogenesis of acute monocytic leukemia and provides a useful new biomarker for relevant cases. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

0036054080	The myelodysplastic syndromes: Analysis of prognostic factors and comparison of prognostic systems in 128 Chinese patients from a single institution	Introduction: Although retrospective analysis were frequently undertaken, and many prognostic systems for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been proposed worldwide, few such studies have been performed and the effectiveness of different scoring systems have not yet been verified in independent patient populations in China. The aim of this single center study was to evaluate the prognostic factors and compare the prognostic scoring systems in Chinese patients with MDS. Materials and methods: One hundred and twenty-eight patients diagnosed as primary MDS in our Institution were studied retrospectively to identify significant prognostic factors and to assess the predictive value of 11 previously described prognostic systems, including French-American-British (FAB) classification, World Health Organization (WHO) classification, Mufti, Sanz, Morra, Aul, Oguma, Toyama, Morel and international prognostic scoring system (IPSS). Results: The median age of the patients was 50 years (range 13-82). The 2- and 5-year survival rate of the patients were 55.22 ± 4.90% and 26.09 ± 6.36% respectively, with a median survival of 31 months (range 1-127 months). Fifty patients (39.1%) had progressed to acute leukemia (AL) with a median time of 8 months (range 1-43 months). Major independent variables indicated by multivariate analysis were the percentage of bone marrow (BM) blast cells and complex karyotype aberrations for survival (P = 0.042 and 0.042, respectively) and only the percentage of BM blast cells for AL transformation (P = 0.023). All the systems except Mufti scores successfully discriminated risk groups concerning both survival and AL evolution, especially in the high risk group, ranging from 10 to 20 months and from 4 to 7 months, respectively. The FAB and WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS possessed lower P value (P < 0.0001) than that of the rest scoring systems. Conclusion: The patients in our study were younger than these of the Western population, whereas the survival and AL transformation ratio were comparable to these previous studies. The BM blast proportion and complex chromosomal defects were highly significant for predicting outcome in MDS patients. Most investigated systems effectively stratified patients into groups with different life expectancies and identified a subset of patients with poor clinical outcome. The FAB, WHO classification, as well as Sanz, Oguma, Morel and IPSS scoring systems were more applicable for predicting survival and leukemia progression.

79959473062	From an old remedy to a magic bullet: Molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of arsenic in fighting leukemia	Arsenic had been used in treating malignancies from the 18th to mid-20th century. In the past 3 decades, arsenic was revived and shown to be able to induce complete remission and to achieve, when combined with all-trans retinoic acid and chemotherapy, a 5-year overall survival of 90% in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia driven by the t(15;17) translocation-generated promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α (PMLRAR α) fusion. Molecularly, arsenic binds thiol residues and induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, thus affecting numerous signaling pathways. Interestingly, arsenic directly binds the C3HC4 zinc finger motif in the RBCC domain of PML and PML-RARα, induces their homodimerization and multimerization, and enhances their interaction with the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9, facilitating subsequent sumoylation/ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Arsenic-caused intermolecular disulfide formation in PML also contributes to PML-multimerization. All-trans retinoic acid, which targets PMLRAR α for degradation through its RARα moiety, synergizes with arsenic in eliminating leukemia-initiating cells. Arsenic perturbs a number of proteins involved in other hematologic malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, whereby it may bring new therapeutic benefits. The successful revival of arsenic in acute promyelocytic leukemia, together with modern mechanistic studies, has thus allowed a new paradigm to emerge in translational medicine. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

79959859182	Sumoylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α promotes the biased primitive hematopoiesis of zebrafish	Hematopoiesis is evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish to mammals, and this includes both primitive and definitive waves during embryogenesis. Primitive hematopoiesis is dominated by erythropoiesis with limited myelopoiesis. Protein sumoylation, a ubiquitination-like posttranslational protein modification, is implicated in a variety of biochemical processes, most notably in transcriptional repression. We show here that the loss of 6 small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) paralogs triggers a sharp upregulation of the myeloid-specific marker mpo and down-regulation of the erythroidspecific marker gata1 in myelo-erythroid progenitor cells (MPCs) in the intermediate cell mass (ICM) during primitive hematopoiesis. Accordingly, in transgenic zebrafish lines, hyposumoylation expands myelopoiesis at the expense of erythropoiesis. ASUMO-CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (SUMO-C/ebpα) fusion restores the normal myelopoiesis/erythropoiesis balance, suggesting that sumoylation status of C/ebpα contributes to myelo-erythroid lineage determination. Our results therefore implicate sumoylation in early lineage determination and reveal the possible molecular mechanism underlying the puzzling biased primitive hematopoiesis in vertebrates. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

80053637716	Dominant-negative C/ebpα and polycomb group protein Bmi1 extend short-lived hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell life span and induce lethal dyserythropoiesis	The primitive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) during embryonic hematopoiesis are thought to be short-lived (SL) with limited self-renewal potential. The fate and consequence of these short-lived HSPCs, once reprogrammed into "long-lived" in a living animal body, remain unknown. Here we show that targeted expression of a dominant-negative C/ebpα (C/ebpαDN) in the primitive SL-HSPCs during zebrafish embryogenesis extends their life span, allowing them to survive to later developmental stage to colonize the definitive hematopoietic sites, where they undergo a proliferative expansion followed by erythropoietic dysplasia and embryonic lethality because of circulation congestion. Mechanistically, C/ebpαDN binds to a conserved C/EBP-binding motif in the promoter region of bmi1 gene, associated with a specific induction of bmi1 transcription in the transgenic embryos expressing C/ebpαDN. Targeted expression of Bmi1 in the SL-HSPCs recapitulates nearly all aberrant phenotypes induced by C/ebpαDN, whereas knockdown of bmi1 largely rescues these abnormalities. The results indicate that Bmi1 acts immediately downstream of C/ebpαDN to regulate the survival and self-renewal of HSPCs and contribute to the erythropoietic dysplasia. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

81555228423	Gene mutation patterns and their prognostic impact in a cohort of 1185 patients with acute myeloid leukemia	To evaluate the prognostic value of genetic mutations for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, we examined the gene status for both fusion products such as AML1 (CBFα)-ETO, CBFβ- MYH11, PML-RARα, and MLL rearrangement as a result of chromosomal translocations and mutations in genes including FLT3, C-KIT, N-RAS, NPM1, CEBPA, WT1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, MLL, IDH1, IDH2, and TET2 in 1185 AML patients. Clinical analysis was mainly carried out among 605 cases without recognizable karyotype abnormalities except for 11q23. Of these 605 patients, 452 (74.7%) were found to have at least 1 mutation, and the relationship of gene mutations with clinical outcome was investigated. We revealed a correlation pattern among NPM1, DNMT3A, FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, CEBPA, and TET2 mutations. Multivariate analysis identified DNMT3A and MLL mutations as independent factors predicting inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS), whereas biallelic CEBPA mutations or NPM1 mutations without DNMT3A mutations conferred a better OS and EFS in both the whole group and among younger patients < 60 years of age. The use of molecular markers allowed us to subdivide the series of 605 patients into distinct prognostic groups with potential clinical relevance. © 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.

84859148351	Targeting of AML1-ETO in t(8;21) leukemia by oridonin generates a tumor suppressor-like protein	Nearly 60% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with the t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation fail to achieve long-term disease-free survival. Our previous studies demonstrated that oridonin selectively induces apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia cells and causes cleavage of AML1-ETO oncoprotein resulting from t(8;21), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We show that oridonin interacted with glutathione and thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase to increase intracellular reactive oxygen species, which in turn activated caspase-3 in t(8;21) cells. Moreover, oridonin bound AML1-ETO, directing the enzymatic cleavage at aspartic acid 188 via caspase-3 to generate a truncated AML1-ETO (DAML1-ETO) and preventing the protein from further proteolysis. ΔAML1-ETO interacted with AML1-ETO and interfered with the trans-regulatory functions of remaining AML1-ETO oncoprotein, thus acting as a tumor suppressor that mediates the anti-leukemia effect of oridonin. Furthermore, oridonin inhibited the activity of c-Kit

84862828134	Arsenic compounds: Revived ancient remedies in the fight against human malignancies	Arsenic, the 20th most abundant element in the earth crust, is one of the oldest drugs in the world. It was used in the 18th century in treating hematopoietic malignancies, discarded in 1950s in favor of chemotherapeutic agents (busulphan and others), and was revived in the 1970s due to its dramatic efficacy on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) driven by the t(15;17) translocation-generated PML-RARα fusion. Arsenic represents the most potent single agent for APL, and achieves a five-year overall survival of 90% in APL patients when combined with all- trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy (daunorubicin and cytarabine), turning this disease from highly fatal to highly curable. Arsenic triggers sumoylation/ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of PML-RARα via directly binding to the C3HC4 zinc finger motif in the RBCC domain of the PML moiety and induction of its homodimerization/multimerization and interaction with the SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9. Because of its multiplicity of targets and complex mechanisms of action, arsenic is widely tested in combination with other agents in a variety of malignancies. Other arsenic containing recipes including oral formulations and organic arsenicals are being developed and tested, and progress in these areas will definitely expand the use of arsenicals in other malignant diseases. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84863116492	Bortezomib interferes with C-KIT processing and transforms the t(8;21)-generated fusion proteins into tumor-suppressing fragments in leukemia cells	The boronic acid dipeptide bortezomib inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome and shows significant therapeutic efficacy in multiple myeloma. However, recent studies suggest that bortezomib may have more complex mechanisms of action in treating cancer. We report here that the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT are required for bortezomib- but not tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib-caused apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumor cells, suggesting that C-KIT may recruit an apoptosis initiator. We show that C-KIT binds and phosphorylates heat shock protein 90β (Hsp90β), which sequestrates apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1). Bortezomib dephosphorylates pHsp90β and releases Apaf-1. Although the activated caspase-3 is not sufficient to cause marked apoptosis, it cleaves the t(8;21) generated acute myeloid leukemia 1-eight twenty one (AML1-ETO) and AML1-ETO9a fusion proteins, with production of cleavage fragments that perturb the functions of the parental oncoproteins and further contribute to apoptosis. Notably, bortezomib exerts potent therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing AML1-ETO9a-driven leukemia. These data show that C-KIT-pHsp90β-Apaf-1 cascade is critical for some malignant cells to evade apoptosis, and the clinical therapeutic potentials of bortezomib in C-KIT-driven neoplasms should be further explored.

84863356975	Functional features of RUNX1 mutants in acute transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia and their contribution to inducing murine full-blown leukemia	The BCR-ABL fusion protein generated by t(9;22)(q34;q11) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of the myeloproliferative disorder status at the chronic phase of the disease, but progression from the chronic phase to blast crisis (BC) is believed to require additional mutations. To explore the underlying mechanisms for BC, which is characterized by a blockage of blood cell differentiation, we screened several genes crucial to hematopoiesis and identified 10 types of mutations in RUNX1 among 11 of 85 (12.9%) patients with acute transformation of CML. Most of the mutations occurred in the runt homology domain, including H78Q, W79C, R139G, D171G, R174Q, L71fs-ter94, and V91fs-ter94. Further studies indicated that RUNX1 mutants not only exhibited decreased transactivation activity but also had an inhibitory effect on the WT RUNX1. To investigate the leukemogenic effect of mutated RUNX1, H78Q and V91fs-ter94 were transduced into 32D cells or BCRABL-harboring murine cells, respectively. Consistent with the myeloblastic features of advanced CML patients with RUNX1 mutations, H78Q and V91fs-ter94 disturbed myeloid differentiation and induced a BC or accelerated phase-like phenotype in mice. These results suggest that RUNX1 abnormalities may promote acute myeloid leukemic transformation in a subset of CML patients. © 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.

84863783339	Newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in China (I): Abnormal genetic patterns in 1346 childhood and adult cases and their comparison with the reports from Western countries	It has been generally acknowledged that the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation of leukemia largely rely on an adequate identification of genetic abnormalities. A systemic analysis of genetic aberrations was performed in a cohort of 1346 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in China. The pediatric patients had higher incidence of hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) (p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 than adults (P0.0001); in contrast, the occurrence of Ph and Ik6 variant of IKZF1 gene was much more frequent in adult patients (all P0.0001). In B-ALL, the existence of Ik6 and that of BCR-ABL were statistically correlated (P0.0001). In comparison with Western cohorts, the incidence of t(9;22) (q34;q11)/BCR-ABL (14.60%) in B-ALL and HOX11 expression in T-ALL (25.24%) seemed to be much higher in our group, while the incidence of t(12;21) (p13;q22)/ETV6-RUNX1 (15.34%) seemed to be lower in Chinese pediatric patients. The occurrence of hyperdiploidy was much lower either in pediatric (10.61% vs 20-38%) or adult patients (2.36% vs 6.77-12%) in our study than in Western reports. In addition, the frequencies of HOX11L2 in adult patients were much higher in our cohort than in Western countries (20.69% vs 4-11%). In general, it seems that Chinese ALL patients bear more adverse prognostic factors than their Western counterparts do. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84863785952	Newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in China (II): Prognosis related to genetic abnormalities in a series of 1091 cases	The molecular characterization of cytogenetic abnormalities has not only provided insights into the mechanisms of leukemogenesis but also led to the establishment of new treatment strategies targeting these abnormalities and thereby further improve the prognosis of patients. We analyzed the prognosis of 1091 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and explored the prognostic impacts of a large number of cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities. It was demonstrated that, in both B-and T-ALL settings, the prognosis was negatively correlated to the age as reported to date. For childhood T-ALL patients, it was also documented that the HOX11 expression represented a favorable prognostic factor as it was in adult ones. We identified CRLF2 overexpression as an intermediate-risk marker and Ik6 variant of IKZF1 gene as a high-risk one when stratifying pediatric B-ALL cases according to cytogenetic/molecular risks. We also found that Ik6 variant and CRLF2 overexpression had an important role in dictating the prognosis of Ph-negative patients, which may be useful markers in guiding the treatment of ALL in the future, with tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the other hand reversing the fate of Ph-positive ALL patients. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84864887658	How to manage acute promyelocytic leukemia	Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a unique subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The prognosis of APL is changing, from the worst among AML as it used to be, to currently the best. The application of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) to the induction therapy of APL decreases the mortality of newly diagnosed patients, thereby significantly improving the response rate. Therefore, ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy has been widely accepted and used as a classic treatment. It has been demonstrated that high doses of cytarabine have a good effect on the prevention of relapse for high-risk patients. However, as the indications of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for APL are being extended from the original relapse treatment to the first-line treatment of de novo APL, we find that the regimen of ATRA, combined with ATO, seems to be a new treatment option because of their targeting mechanisms, milder toxicities and improvements of long-term outcomes; this combination may become a potentially curable treatment modality for APL. We discuss the therapeutic strategies for APL, particularly the novel approaches to newly diagnosed patients and the handling of side effects of treatment and relapse treatment, so as to ensure each newly diagnosed patient of APL the most timely and best treatment. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

0037188535	Variant-type PML-RARα fusion transcript in acute promyelocytic leukemia: Use of a cryptic coding sequence from intron 2 of the RARα gene and identification of a new clinical subtype resistant to retinoic acid therapy	The physiologic actions of retinoic acids (RAs) are mediated through RA receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). The RARα gene has drawn particular attention because it is the common target in all chromosomal translocations in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique model in cancer research that responds to the effect of RA. In the great majority of patients with APL, RARα is fused to the PML gene as a result of the t(15;17) translocation. Three distinct types of PML-RARα transcripts, long (L), short (S), and variant (V), were identified. The V-type is characterized by truncation of exon 6 of PML and in some cases by the insertion of a variable "spacer" sequence between the truncated PML and RARα mRNA fusion partners, although the precise mechanisms underlying formation of the V-type transcript remain unclear. To get further insights into the molecular basis of the t(15;17), we sequenced the entire genomic DNA region of RARα. Of note, all previously reported "spacer" sequences in V-type transcripts were found in intron 2 of the RARα gene and most of these sequences were flanked by gt splice donor sites. In most cases, these "cryptic" coding sequences maintained the ORF of the chimeric transcript. Interestingly, two cases with a relatively long spacer sequence showed APL cellular and clinical resistance to RA treatment. In these cases, the aberrant V-type PML-RARα protein displayed increased affinity to the nuclear corepressor protein SMRT, providing further evidence that RA exerts the therapeutic effect on APL through modulation of the RAR-corepressor interaction. Finally, among patients with the L- or S-type PML-RARα fusion transcript, some consensus motifs were identified at the hotspots of the chromosome 17q breakpoints within intron 2 of RARα, strengthening the importance of this intron in the molecular pathogenesis of APL.

Chromosome 21 is the smallest chromosome in the human genome, and some of its regions have been implicated in mental retardation and other diseases. In this study, we sequenced the coding and regulatory regions of 127 known genes on human chromosome 21 in DNA samples from human and chimpanzees and a part of the corresponding genes from orangutan, gorilla, and macaque. Overall, 3,003 nucleotide differences between human and chimpanzee were identified over ≈400 kb. The differences in coding, promoter, and exon-intron junction regions were 0.51 ± 0.02%, 0.88 ± 0.03%, and 0.85 ± 0.02%, respectively, much lower than the previously reported 1.23% in genomic regions, which suggests the presence of purifying selection. Significant variation in substitution rate among genes was observed by comparing the divergence between human and chimpanzee. Furthermore, by implementing a bioinformatics-based approach, we showed that the identification of genetic variants specific to the human lineage might lead to an understanding of the mechanisms that are attributable to the phenotypes that unique to humans, by changing the structure and/or dosage of the proteins expressed. A phylogenetic analysis unambiguously confirms the conclusion that chimpanzees were our closest relatives to the exclusion of other primates and the relative divergence of the Homo-Pan and that of (Homo-Pan)-Gorilla are 4.93 million years and 7.26 million years, respectively.

84868253855	Accelerate the translational research and promote the systems biology study on hematology	Leukemia is a malignancy of serious harm to human health and its pathogenesis needs to be further clarified. With the rapid development of science and technology, study on disease mechanism is no longer limited to a single point of view, but aim to integrate the different levels of information, focus on mutual relations and interactions between molecules, in order to understand the systems biological dysfunction in the disease. Thus, using systems biological methods to study in depth the leukemia development, and in this setting, applying the idea of translational medicine to explore the targeted therapy of leukemia, has an important significance for the final capture of the disease. During the construction of the "211 Project", Shanghai Institute of Hematology has made a major breakthrough in the basic and clinical studies of differentiation and apoptosis-induced targeted therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), making APL the first curable acute myeloid leukemia, and the successful example of leukemia gene product-based targeted therapy. This will be further extended to other types of leukemia. Also, our group has made a significant progress on leukemia systems biology research, being the first to carry out the Leukemia Genome Anatomy Project. Using exome sequencing of acute monocytic leukemia, we identify the mutations and epigenetic changes of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) gene, which is closely related to the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of leukemia patients. We also study at the genome-wide level the APL pathogenesis and illustrate the target genes transcriptionally repressed by PML-RARα oncoprotein. These results not only provide guidance on leukemia pathogenesis, molecular typing and standardized clinical pathway of leukemia, but also deepen the theoretical connotations of "translational medical research" and use target therapy to save thousands of leukemia patients world-wide.

84873430253	Eriocalyxin B ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by suppressing Th1 and Th17 cells	Eriocalyxin B (EriB), a diterpenoid isolated from Isodon eriocalyx, was previously reported to have antitumor effects via multiple pathways, and these pathways are related to immune responses. In this study, we demonstrated that EriB was efficacious in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Treatment with EriB led to amelioration of EAE, which correlated with reduced spinal cord inflammation and demyelination. EriB treatment abolished encephalitogenic T-cell responses to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in an adoptive transfer EAE model. The underlying mechanism of EriB-induced effects involved inhibition of T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell differentiation through Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator Of Transcription and Nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways as well as elevation of reactive oxygen species. These findings indicate that EriB exerts potent antiinflammatory effects through selective modulation of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells by targeting critical signaling pathways. The study provides insights into the role of EriB as a unique therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

84874456701	8-CPT-cAMP/all-trans retinoic acid targets t(11;17) acute promyelocytic leukemia through enhanced cell differentiation and PLZF/RARα degradation	The refractoriness of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(11;17)(q23;q21) to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-based therapy concerns clinicians and intrigues basic researchers. By using a murine leukemic model carrying both promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/retinoic acid receptor-α (PLZF/RARα) and RARα/PLZF fusion genes, we discovered that 8-chlorophenylthio adenosine-3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) enhances cellular differentiation and improves gene trans-activation by ATRA in leukemic blasts. Mechanistically, in combination with ATRA, 8-CPT-cAMP activates PKA, causing phosphorylation of PLZF/RARα at Ser765 and resulting in increased dissociation of the silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors/nuclear receptor corepressor from PLZF/RARα. This process results in changes of local chromatin and transcriptional reactivation of the retinoic acid pathway in leukemic cells. Meanwhile, 8-CPT-cAMP also potentiated ATRA-induced degradation of PLZF/RARα through its Ser765 phosphorylation. In vivo treatment of the t(11;17) APL mouse model demonstrated that 8-CPT-cAMP could significantly improve the therapeutic effect of ATRA by targeting a leukemia-initiating cell activity. This combined therapy, which induces enhanced differentiation and oncoprotein degradation, may benefit t(11;17) APL patients.

84875304496	DNA Methyltransferases in Hematologic Malignancies	DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are the key enzymes for genome methylation, which plays an important role in epigenetically regulated gene expression and repression. Mouse models with conditional knockout of the DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) genes have revealed a role of DNA methylation in mediating the self-renewal and differentiation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and the leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Recently, various mutations of DNMT3A and other DNA methylation regulators have been identified in hematologic malignancies. Functional analysis of these mutations may lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanisms, and even the discovery of new biomarkers and/or drug targets, as well as more rational design of therapeutic regimens. Moreover, DNMTs inhibitors as epigenetic drugs have already been approved by US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use and some clinical trials are currently underway in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This review focuses on the biology of DNMTs with regard to epigenetic regulation, HSC renewal/differentiation, and drug discovery for targeted therapy, and delineates the latest studies that have been conducted to unfold the relationship between aberrant DNMTs and hematologic malignancies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84876272628	Rig-I regulates NF-κB activity through binding to Nf-κb1 3′-UTR mRNA	Retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) senses viral RNAs and triggers innate antiviral responses through induction of type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines. However, whether RIG-I interacts with host cellular RNA remains undetermined. Here we report that Rig-I interacts with multiple cellular mRNAs, especially Nf-κb1. Rig-I is required for NF-κB activity via regulating Nf-κb1 expression at posttranscriptional levels. It interacts with the multiple binding sites within 3′-UTR of Nf-κb1 mRNA. Further analyses reveal that three distinct tandem motifs enriched in the 3′-UTR fragments can be recognized by Rig-I. The 3′-UTR binding with Rig-I plays a critical role in normal translation of Nf-κb1 by recruiting the ribosomal proteins [ribosomal protein L13 (Rpl13) and Rpl8] and rRNAs (18S and 28S). Down-regulation of Rig-I or Rpl13 significantly reduces Nf-κb1 and 3′-UTR-mediated luciferase expression levels. These findings indicate that Rig-I functions as a positive regulator for NF-κB signaling and is involved in multiple biological processes in addition to host antivirus immunity.

84882373704	RARα-PLZF oncogene inhibits C/EBPα function in myeloid cells	In acute promyelocytic leukemia, granulocytic differentiation is arrested at the promyelocyte stage. The variant t(11;17) translocation produces two fusion proteins, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor ? (PLZF-RAR?) and RAR?-PLZF, both of which participate in leukemia development. Here we provide evidence that the activity of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein ? (C/EBP?), a master regulator of granulocytic differentiation, is severely impaired in leukemic promyelocytes with the t(11;17) translocation compared with those associated with the t(15;17) translocation. We show that RAR?-PLZF inhibits myeloid cell differentiation through interactions with C/EBP? tethered to DNA, using ChIP and DNA capture assays. Furthermore, RAR?-PLZF recruits HDAC1 and causes histone H3 deacetylation at C/EBP? target loci, thereby decreasing the expression of C/EBP? target genes. In line with these results, HDAC inhibitors restore in part C/EBP? target gene expression. These findings provide molecular evidence for a mechanism through which RAR?-PLZF acts as a modifier oncogene that subverts differentiation in the granulocytic lineage by associating with C/EBP? and inhibiting its activity.

84883199435	An X chromosome-wide association analysis identifies variants in GPR174 as a risk factor for Graves' disease	Background: Graves' disease is a female preponderant autoimmune illness and the contribution of the X chromosome to its risk has long been appreciated. However, no X-linked susceptibility loci have been indentified from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Methods: We re-examined the X chromosome data from our recent GWAS for Graves' disease by including males that were previously excluded from the X chromosome analyses. The data were analysed using logistic regression analysis including sex as a covariate, and an additive method assuming X chromosome inactivation, implemented in snpMatrix. Results: A cluster of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) at Xq21.1 was found showing association with genome-wide significance, among which rs3827440 was a non-synonymous SNP of GPR174 (Plogistic regression= 9.52×10-8; PsnpMatrix=4.60×10-9; OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.45 to 2.13). The association was reproduced in an independent sample collection set including 4564 Graves' disease cases and 3968 sex matched controls (combined Plogistic regression=5.53×10-21; combined PsnpMatrix=4.26×10-22; OR=1.69, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.86). Notably, GPR174 was widely expressed in immune related tissues and rs3827440 genotypes were associated with distinct mRNA levels (p=0.002). GPR174 did not show sex biased gene expression in our expression analysis. Resequencing study suggested the contribution of some rare variants in the GPR174 gene region to disease risk with a collapsing p value of 1.16×10-3. Conclusions: The finding of an X-linked risk locus for Graves' disease expands our understanding of the role of the X chromosome in disease susceptibility.

84882967201	Prognostic significance of monitoring leukemia-associated immunophenotypes by eight-color flow cytometry in adult B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia	Minimal residual disease (MRD) is of the most important factor for predicting prognosis and guiding treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated the prognostic significance of leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) as assessment of index of MRD in 125 adult B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients by eight-color flow cytometry. The LAIPs could be identified in 96% and 81.6% of patients with the sensitivity of 10 -4 and 10 -5, respectively. MRD-negative status could clearly predict a favorable 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at the end of induction of complete remission and one cycle of consolidation treatment. Moreover, we identified a group of cases with MRD of 0.001% to <0.01%, which showed significantly higher 2-year relapse rate than those with undetectable one. In multivariate analysis, MRD status was associated with RFS or OS independently. Furthermore, MRD assessed by LAIPs and RQ-PCR assay for patients with BCR-ABL fusion gene yielded concordant results in 89.7% of cases. In conclusion, MRD evaluated by eight-color flow cytometry could provide an important tool to assess treatment response and prognosis precisely in adult B-ALL.© 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84885023462	The genome of the hydatid tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus	Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease), caused by the tapeworm E. granulosus, is responsible for considerable human morbidity and mortality. This cosmopolitan disease is difficult to diagnose, treat and control. We present a draft genomic sequence for the worm comprising 151.6 Mb encoding 11,325 genes. Comparisons with the genome sequences from other taxa show that E. granulosus has acquired a spectrum of genes, including the EgAgB family, whose products are secreted by the parasite to interact and redirect host immune responses. We also find that genes in bile salt pathways may control the bidirectional development of E. granulosus, and sequence differences in the calcium channel subunit EgCa v β 1 may be associated with praziquantel sensitivity. Our study offers insights into host interaction, nutrient acquisition, strobilization, reproduction, immune evasion and maturation in the parasite and provides a platform to facilitate the development of new, effective treatments and interventions for echinococcosis control. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

84885759123	Prognostic significance of 2-hydroxyglutarate levels in acute myeloid leukemia in China	The 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) has been reported to result from mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) genes and to function as an "oncometabolite." To evaluate the clinical significance of serum 2-HG levels in hematologic malignancies, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in particular, we analyzed this metabolite in distinct types of human leukemia and lymphoma and established the range of serum 2-HG in appropriate normal control individuals by using gas chromatograph-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Aberrant serum 2-HG pattern was detected in the multicenter group of AML, with 62 of 367 (17%) patients having 2-HG levels above the cutoff value (2.01, log2-transformed from 4.03 μg/mL). IDH1/2 mutations occurred in 27 of 31 (87%) AML cases with very high 2-HG, but were observed only in 9 of 31 (29%) patients with moderately high 2-HG, suggesting other genetic or biochemical events may exist in causing 2-HG elevation. Indeed, glutamine-related metabolites exhibited a pattern in favor of 2-HG synthesis in the high 2-HG group. In AML patients with cytogenetically normal AML (n = 234), high 2-HG represented a negative prognostic factor in both overall survival and event-free survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses confirmed high serum 2-HG as a strong prognostic predictor independent of other clinical and molecular features. We also demonstrated distinct gene-expression/ DNA methylation profiles in AML blasts with high 2-HG compared with those with normal ones, supporting a role that 2- HG plays in leukemogenesis.

0141725587	Major form of NUP98/HOXC11 fusion in adult AMLwith t(11;12)(p15;q13) translocation exhibits aberrant trans-regulatory activity	Three adult patients with de novo acute myelold leukemia of distinct subtypes harboring t(11;12)(p15;q13) have been investigated to characterize the genes involved in that translocation. Through molecular cytogenetics, a chromosome break was detected at the 3′ part of nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) gene at 11p15. Using rapid amplification of cDNA end, we identified the partner gene at 12q13, HOXC11. Molecular analysis showed that exon 12 of NUP98 was fused in-frame to exon 2 of HOXC11 in all three cases with t(11;12)(p15;q13). Therefore, this type of fusion may represent the major form of the NUP98-HOXC11 chimera so far reported. Moreover, two out of three cases had a confirmed deletion of the 3′ part of NUP98 gene and more telomeric region of 11p harboring a group of tumor-suppressor genes. Interestingly, the NUP98-HOXC11 protein when assayed in a GAL4 reporter system, showed an aberrant trans-regulatory activity as compared to the wild-type HOXC11 in both COS-7 and HL-60 cells. Therefore, NUP98-HOXC11 may contribute to the leukemogenesis by interfering with the cellular mechanism of transcriptional regulation.

84894303664	DNMT3A Arg882 mutation drives chronic myelomonocytic leukemia through disturbing gene expression/DNA methylation in hematopoietic cells	The gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is mutated in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases, with Arg882 (R882) as the hotspot. Here, we addressed the transformation ability of the DNMT3A-Arg882His (R882H) mutant by using a retroviral transduction and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) approach and found that the mutant gene can induce aberrant proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. At 12 mo post-BMT, all mice developed chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with thrombocytosis. RNA microarray analysis revealed abnormal expressions of some hematopoiesis- related genes, and the DNA methylation assay identified corresponding changes in methylation patterns in gene body regions. Moreover, DNMT3A-R882H increased the CDK1 protein level and enhanced cell-cycle activity, thereby contributing to leukemogenesis.

10744227258	Rapid induction of cAMP/PKA pathway during retinoic acid-induced acute promyelocytic leukemia cell differentiation	The second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) plays an important role proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. In the present work, we evaluated the cAMP signaling in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells in the context of differentiaton induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). There was a marked increase in the intracellular cAMP level within a few minutes after treatment with ATRA an APL cell line NB4 and fresh APL cells, whereas no such phenomenon was observed in NB4-R1 cells that are resistant to ATRA-induced maturation. In addition, the basal level on intracellular cAMP was lower in NB4-R1 than NB4 cells. Mechanistic study showed that this induction of cAMP was mediated through the activation of adenylate cyclase. Moreover, we found that cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity was quickly upregulated in parallel ATRA-treated NB4 cells, and the phosphorylation of RARα by PKA could increase its transactivation effect. Use of H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, could partially suppress the transcriptional expression of ATRA target genes and ATRA-induced differentiation of APL cells. Taken together, we suggested a crosstalk between ATRA-induced cytosolic pathway and nuclear pathway in APL cell differentiation.

12644292925	Cloning of a gene (rig-g) associated with retinoic acid-induced differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and representing a new member of a family of interferon-stimulated genes	In a cell line (NB4) derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and interferon (IFN) induce the expression of a novel gene we call RIG-G (for retinoic acid-induced gene G). This gene codes for a 58-kDa protein containing 490 amino acids with several potential sites for post-translational modification. In untreated NB4 cells, the expression of RIG-G is undetectable. ATRA treatment induces the transcriptional expression of RIG-G relatively late (12-24 hr) in a protein synthesis-dependent manner, whereas IFN-α induces its expression early (30 min to 3 hr). Database search has revealed a high-level homology between RIG- G and several IFN-stimulated genes in human (ISG54K, ISG56K, and IFN- inducible and retinoic acid-inducible 58K gene) and some other species, defining a well conserved gene family. The gene is composed of two exons and has been mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization to chromosome 10q24, where two other human IFN-stimulated gene members are localized. A synergistic induction of RIG-G expression in NB4 cells by combined treatment with ATRA and IFNs suggests that a collaboration exists between their respective signaling pathways.

12944267044	Gene expression profiling in the human hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and full-length cDNA cloning	The primary neuroendocrine interface, hypothalamus and pituitary, together with adrenals, constitute the major axis responsible for the maintenance of homeostasis and the response to the perturbations in the environment. The gene expression profiling in the human hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis was catalogued by generating a large amount of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), followed by bioinformatics analysis (http://www.chgc.sh.cn/ database). Totally, 25,973 sequences of good quality were obtained from 31,130 clones (83.4%) from cDNA libraries of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands. After eliminating 5,347 sequences corresponding to repetitive elements and mtDNA, 20,626 ESTs could be assembled into 9,175 clusters (3,979, 3,074, and 4,116 clusters in hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands, respectively) when overlapping ESTs were integrated. Of these clusters, 2,777 (30.3%) corresponded to known genes, 4,165 (44.8%) to dbESTs, and 2,233 (24.3%) to novel ESTs. The gene expression profiles reflected well the functional characteristics of the three levels in the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, because most of the 20 genes with highest expression showed statistical difference in terms of tissue distribution, including a group of tissue-specific functional markers. Meanwhile, some findings were made with regard to the physiology of the axis, and 200 full-length cDNAs of novel genes were cloned and sequenced. All of these data may contribute to the understanding of the neuroendocrine regulation of human life.

13844281112	Arsenic in cancer therapy	Arsenic, a natural substance that has been used as a drug for over 2000 years, has been revived because of its remarkable therapeutic efficacy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Arsenic exerts a dose-dependent dual effect: it causes differentiation at low concentrations and apoptosis at relatively high concentrations. Specific degradation of the leukemogenic PML-RARα fusion protein induced by arsenic leads to the differentiation of leukemia cells. The arsenic-induced apoptosis occurs through direct effects on mitochondria, causing the release of apoptotic proteins into the cytosol and the activation of caspases. Preliminary in vitro studies have also extended the potential anti-cancer effect of arsenic to non-APL leukemias, lymphoid malignancies and other cancers. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that arsenic exerts a broad spectrum of anti-cancer effects by induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, anti-angiogenesis and possible immunomodulation. Phase I and II clinical trials are underway to evaluate the feasibility, safety and potential effect of arsenic in various cancer types. © 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
