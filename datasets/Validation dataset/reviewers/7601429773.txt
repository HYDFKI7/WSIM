9544248643	Effect of octreotide on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions in rats	Background: Octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue that can inhibit glycosaminoglycan synthesis by fibroblasts in skin, may be a potent inhibitor of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions. An animal model was developed to evaluate the effect of octreotide. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Laparotomy with a 15-cm intestinal resection and reanastomosis was performed on each group of rats. The intestinal serosa was also scratched to induce adhesion formation. No medication was given to group-1 rats (C). Group-2 rats received peritoneal irrigation with 6 ml normal saline intraoperatively (NS). Group-3 rats received irrigation with 6 ml octreotide solution (5 μg/ml) intraperitoneally (Oc). Group-4 rats received irrigation with 6 ml octreotide solution intraoperatively and 10 μg/kg of octreotide injection intramuscularly twice a day for 14 days (Oc + IM). All rats were killed 2 weeks later. The number of fibrous bands at and away from the anastomotic site was recorded. The strength and extent of the fibrous bands were also measured. Results: The total scores of intraperitoneal adhesion bands were significantly reduced in group Oc and group Oc + IM rats when compared with group C (p < 0.05). When the fibrous bands at the anastomotic site and away from it were distinguished, the results were the same. As to the strength and extent of intestinal adhesions, the data showed no significant difference among all tour groups. Conclusions: These data supported the suggestion that octreotide can reduce the incidence of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions in rats.

14244255648	Cellular neurothekeoma with atypical features in a child	Cellular neurothekeoma (CNT) is an uncommon benign skin neoplasm and a variant of neurothekeoma (NT). Histopathological examination of cellular neurothekeoma often reveals mild cellular atypia and occasional mitoses. CNTs with atypical features (including large size, deep penetration, marked cytologic pleomorphism, high mitotic rate, diffusely infiltrative borders, vascular invasion) are very rare. The rare presence of atypical features may sometimes make CNT difficult to distinguish from soft tissue sarcoma. We describe a case of a 9-year-old girl with a progressively enlarging left thigh tumor (1.5 × 1.3 × 1 cm) over 6 months. After total resection of the tumor, examination revealed histological findings consistent with cellular neurothekeoma but with prominent atypical features, including deep penetration into the subcutaneous adipose tissue, marked cytological pleomorphism, high mitotic rate (5/10HPF), and diffusely infiltrative border. Immunohistochemically, these cells were positive for α-smooth muscle actin, but negative for cytokeratin and S-100. Her clinical course was uneventful without recurrence after one and a half years of follow-up.

1642382931	Resveratrol Suppresses the Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth of Gliomas in Rats	Purpose: We wanted to investigate the antitumor effects and effect on angiogenesis of resveratrol in rat RT-2 gliomas. Experimental Design: RT-2 glioma cells were treated with resveratrol, and then cytotoxicity was assayed, apoptosis was measured by flow-activated cell sorter flow cytometry, and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor was measured by reverse transcription-PCR. Tumor size, animal survival time, and survival rate were followed in resveratrol-treated rats with s.c. or intracerebral gliomas. Furthermore, in vitro proliferation was assayed to explore the effect of resveratrol on the proliferation of ECV304 human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Expression of CD31 in resveratrol-treated gliomas was followed immunohistochemically to study the effect of resveratrol on the glioma-induced angiogenesis. Results: Resveratrol was demonstrated to exert cytotoxic effects and induce glioma cell apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Resveratrol (40 mg/kg/day) exerted significant antitumor effects on s.c. tumors, including slower tumor growth rate, longer animal survival time, and higher animal survival rate (P < 0.05). In contrast, resveratrol affected intracerebral tumors at only an increased dose (100 mg/kg/day), prolonging animal survival (P < 0.05) without affecting survival rate. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in the glioma cells and the proliferation of ECV304 cells were inhibited by resveratrol in a concentration-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the s.c. gliomas from resveratrol-treated rats had fewer microvessel densities than did control rats (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Resveratrol caused significant glioma cell cytotoxicity and apoptosis, exerted antitumor effects on the s.c. and intracerebral gliomas, and inhibited angiogenesis in s.c. gliomas. Thus, resveratrol might be considered a possible treatment strategy for gliomas.

14644437735	Induction of T-cell apoptosis in rats by genetically engineered glioma cells expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and B7.1	Purpose: To evaluate antitumor effects on intracerebral gliomas of genetically engineered tumor vaccines expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), B7.1, or both (combination). Experimental Design: A rat glioma cell line, RT-2, was engineered with a retroviral vector to express GM-CSF, B7.1, or combination. Tumorigenicity of engineered cells and therapeutic effects of s.c. given irradiated or live tumor vaccines on parental intracerebral gliomas were studied. Immune cell infiltration induced at vaccine and tumor sites was examined by histologic and immunohistochemical staining. Apoptosis of T cells from vaccine sites was analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Results: Engineered RT-2 cells exhibited reduced s.c. tumorigenicity in rats with reduced tumor growth and prolonged animal survival time compared with control rats. Rats with intracerebral gliomas s.c. treated with irradiated or live GM-CSF-expressing vaccines had 60% and 100% survival rates, respectively, significantly better than the control groups (P < 0.05). In contrast, rats treated with vaccines expressing B7.1 or the combination had no or mild therapeutic effects. Studies revealed less T-cell infiltration at both vaccine and tumor sites in rats treated with vaccines expressing B7.1 or the combination than in rats treated with a vaccine expressing GM-CSF. Cell sorting analyses revealed higher proportions of apoptotic T cells at vaccine sites of rats treated with the combination than those treated with vaccine expressing GM-CSF. Conclusions: Combination of GM-CSF- and B7.1-expressing tumor vaccines exerted no synergistic, or even worse, therapeutic effects on gliomas compared with single GM-CSF-secreting tumor vaccine. The worse therapeutic effects of the GM-B7.1-expressing tumor vaccine than the GM-CSF-expressing tumor vaccine were related to the reduced T-cell amount and increased T-cell apoptosis in the former. © 2005 American Association for Cancer Research.

17044415642	Cervical dumbbell meningioma and thoracic dumbbell schwannoma in a patient with neurofibromatosis	The occurrence of both dumbbell meningioma and dumbbell schwannoma in one patient has not been reported in the literature. We present a 16-year-old female patient, who had progressive bilateral hearing impairment for 5 years and a progressively enlarged, non-tender neck mass for 1.5 years. Mild motor weakness over her right upper limb was noted 1 week before admission. No café-au-lait spot was noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors, a C1-2 dumbbell tumor, and a T5-6 dumbbell tumor. Neurofibromatosis type 2 was diagnosed. The cervical spine and thoracic spine tumors were removed via one-staged combined posterior (laminectomy) and antero-lateral (transforaminal or thoracoscopic) approaches during two operations performed 1 month apart. The pathology revealed meningioma and schwannoma, respectively. The patient had good recovery after these two operations and her motor function improved. Six months after the second surgery, radiosurgery was performed for the bilateral acoustic tumors, because of enlarged tumor size on follow-up MRI. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported in the literature of a patient, having both dumbbell meningioma and dumbbell schwannoma. A literature review of the dumbbell tumors was done, and their treatment strategies were discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

17044440309	Traumatic intramural hematoma of the duodenum: Report of one case	Traumatic intramural hematoma of the duodenum is a rare entity in children. A high clinical index of suspicion is necessary for early and accurate diagnosis. We report a 10-year-old girl presenting with a sudden onset of epigastralgia after impact on the epigastrium by the edge of a wooden bed while playing on it. Symptoms of high gastrointestinal obstruction were severe, with bilious and large amounts of nasogastric effluent. Image studies revealed a large hematoma extending from the second to the third portion of the duodenum. Her condition was managed successfully by conservative treatments with nasogastric decompression and total parenteral nutrition. Her hospital course was uneventful. This report serves as a reminder to clinicians to consider intramural hematoma of the duodenum in the differential diagnosis of blunt abdominal trauma.

18544365059	Quantitative gene expression analysis by cDNA microarray during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats	Purpose. It is speculated that genetic regulation plays an important role during liver regeneration. We conducted this study to analyze quantitative gene expression during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Methods. Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into ten groups of six. One group of rats was killed preoperatively and the other nine groups were killed 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 5 and 7 days after 70% partial hepatectomy, respectively. The remnant livers were isolated for mRNA extraction. A mass survey of gene expression by cDNA microarray carrying 6144 polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragments was prepared by an arraying machine. The microarray images were scanned, digitized, and analyzed using a flatbed scanner. Results. The variations in gene expression were classified into 72 different patterns including a pattern with a single peak, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 72 h, and 5 and 7 days after partial hepatectomy. The other patterns included double peaks, enhancing trend, diminished trend, protruding curve, excavated curve, and various mixed types. Each category of gene expression pattern contained 40-218 different proto-oncogenes. Conclusion. The quantitative gene expression profiles have important implications, warranting further investigation of the genetic mechanisms involved in the process of liver regeneration. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

0031744880	Tissue plasminogen activator reduces intraperitoneal adhesion after intestinal resection in rats	We investigated whether tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) a plasma serine protease that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in fibrinolysis inhibits postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation in rats. Male Wistar rats weighing 1200 to 250-g-underwent telaparotomy with a 15-cm intestinal resection and reanastomosis the intestinal serosa was scratched to induce adhesion formation. The rats were divided into three groups: the control group received no medication the normal saline group received peritoneal irrigation with 6 mL normal saline intraoperatively and the tPA group received peritoneal irrigation with a 6 mL tPA solution (6 5mg/L) intraoperatively. The rats were killed 7 or 14 days later. The scores (severity of adhesion, 0-3 point scale), strength, and extent of fibrous bands were recorded on the day, the rats were killed. Wound strength was measured using an Instron tensionmeter immediately after the rats were killed. The concentrations of plasma tPA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) -1 and -2 were measured. The scores and strength of fibrous bands in the tPA group were lower than those in the control and saline groups whereas wound strength was similar in all groups. The plasma tPA concentration was significantly higher and the plasma PAI-1 and PAI-2 concentrations were significantly lower in the tPA group than in the control and saline groups on the 7th and 14th postoperative days. Our findings suggest that tPA can reduce the incidence of postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions without impairing wound-healing.

0031435970	Intracranial hemangiopericytoma with multiple extracranial metastasis - Case report and literature review	Hemangiopericytoma is a rare type of vascular tumor that is highly aggressive and has a high recurrence rate. We report the case of a 44 year old woman in whom intracranial meningeal hemangiopericytoma with multiple extracranial metastasis involving the liver, left lung, cervical and lumbosacral spine was diagnosed. She had previously received surgery to excise the left parasagittal tumor in 1986 and had undergone two subsequent operations for tumor recurrence in 1990 and 1992, respectively. She had also received an operation to excise a midline posterior fossa tumor in 1994. A lung tumor in the left upper lobe and a liver mass in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe were also discovered during her hospitalization in 1994, and video-assissted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the left lung tumor and laparoscopic biopsy of the liver mass were performed. In 1995, resection of a right side cerebellopontine angle tumor and a subsequent operation for resection of a cervical spinal tumor were performed. The histopathology of tissue specimens obtained in all of the above mentioned eight operations revealed meningeal hemangiopericytoma. The clinical, radiological and pathological features of the meningeal hemangiopericytoma of the patient are presented with a discussion of difference in the histopathological features of meningioma and meningeal hemangiopericytoma.

0031984833	Carnitine contents in remnant liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle after partial hepatectomy in rats: Randomized trial	Carnitine, an important carrier of free fatty acid that is transported into mitochondria for beta-oxidation, was thought to be one of the key factors in the regulation of liver regeneration. If the carnitine content is insufficient in the hepatocyte, it might impair the energy substrate's transport and the energy charge required for cell regeneration. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes of carnitine content in remnant liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle simultaneously after partial hepatectomy in rats. Partial hepatectomy with resection of the median and left lateral lobes was performed on male Wistar rats. Rats with a sham operation comprised a control group. This study was an experimental randomized trial. Ten rats from each group were sacrificed before the operation and at 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the operation. The carnitine content, as total and free forms, in remnant liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle were quantified by high- performance liquid chromatography. The carnitine contents in the remnant liver increased significantly at 6, 24, and 48 hours after partial hepatectomy (p < 0.01). The increase of total carnitine content was more obvious than that of the free form. In contrast, the decreasing concentrations of total carnitine and free carnitine in the kidney were significant (p < 0.01). In skeletal muscle the total carnitine content decreased to a small extent, and it was observed only at 6 hours after partial hepatectomy (p < 0.05). It is suggested that remnant liver promoted the generation of carnitine, whereas kidney and skeletal muscle released their stored carnitine at an early stage after partial hepatectomy. As a result, the influx of the carnitine into hepatocytes increased at the regenerative stage. The carnitine content of remnant liver is sufficient during the early posthepatectomy stage.

23244466232	Chondroma of the falx - Case report	An intracranial chondroma is uncommon; however, a falx chondroma is rare. We report on a 26-year-old woman who had had a history of intermittent headaches for 10 years. Two weeks before admission, a brain tumor was incidentally found on a computed tomography scan after a motor vehicle accident. On admission, she was alert and had no neurological deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a multilobular, ring-shaped, well-defined tumor at the anterior falx. The tumor involved both sides of the falx and extended to the bifrontal area. She underwent surgery and the tumor was totally excised. She recovered well after the operation. The pathology revealed a chondroma. To the best of our knowledge, only 14 cases of intracranial chondromas derived from the falx have been reported. In this report, we discuss the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis in imaging studies, treatment, and prognosis of a falx chondroma.

2342650908	Primary volvulus of the ileum in a preterm infant	Primary volvulus of the small intestine is rare in neonates. We report a case of primary volvulus of the ileum in a preterm newborn. Vomiting and abdominal distension began 10 hours after birth, followed by hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and acidosis. Plain abdominal radiograph revealed a pattern of diffuse ileus and very dilated loops at the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Three days later, another plain film showed increased fluid accumulation and decreased air in these dilated loops. Emergency laparotomy revealed primary volvulus of the distal ileum with gangrenous change. Resection of the necrotic ileum with an end-to-end ileoileostomy was performed and the patient recovered fully. In a newborn with ileus and rapidly deteriorating hemodynamics, early surgical intervention is essential to achieve good prognosis.

2542418258	Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and caspase 3 in the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of rat glioma cells	Purpose: The mechanisms of the antitumor effects of tamoxifen upon gliomas are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and caspase 3 in the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of rat glioma cells. Methods: Glioma cells were treated with tamoxifen, followed by a cytotoxicity assay to study its effects on the cells, and then a flow-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis was performed to analyze the cellular apoptosis of the glioma cells. The expression of JNK1 and phospho-specific JNK1 in glioma cells treated with tamoxifen was investigated by Western blot analysis. The activity of caspase 3 in glioma cells was analyzed by caspase activity assay. Results: Tamoxifen was demonstrated to exert cytotoxic effects upon and induced apoptosis of the glioma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Western blot analysis demonstrated that tamoxifen increased the expression of phospho-specific JNK1 in glioma cells, and an increasing concentration of tamoxifen induced an increasing expression of phospho-specific JNK1. Four-hour 50-μM tamoxifen treatment increased the expression of phospho-specific JNK1 to 3.2 times that of the control level in glioma cells. Tamoxifen also increased the activity of caspase 3 in glioma cells. Pretreatment of glioma cells with the antisense oligonucleotide (OGN) of JNK1 immediately prior to tamoxifen treatment suppressed the expression of phospho-specific JNK1 and the activity of caspase 3. The apoptosis fraction of glioma cells induced by 4-h treatment with 50 μM tamoxifen was decreased from 51% to 28% by pretreatment with the antisense OGN of JNK1 (P < 0.003), and to 20% by pretreatment with caspase 3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO) (P < 0.0008). Conclusions: The results suggest that the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of rat glioma cells is related to the activation of the JNK1/caspase 3 signaling pathway; however, the confirmation of the occurrence of such activation in vivo needs further investigation. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

27944480351	Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in glioma cells by GL331 (a topoisomerase II inhibitor)	Background: GL331 is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and, in this study, the effects of GL331 upon rat C6 glioma cells were investigated. Materials and Methods: The glioma cells were treated with GL331, then a cytotoxicity assay was done to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of GL331 and flow-activated cell sorter analysis was performed to analyze the cellular apoptosis and cell cycle distribution of the glioma cells. The expressions of p53, p21 and 14-3-3σ in glioma cells treated with GL331 were investigated by Western blot analysis. Results: GL331 was demonstrated to exert cytotoxic effects upon and induce apoptosis of the C6 glioma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). GL331 also caused the glioma cells to accumulate in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle and increased the expressions of p53, p21 and 14-3-3σ. Conclusion: GL331 exerts cytotoxic effects and induces apoptosis in C6 glioma cells, accompanied by cell accumulation in the G2/M-phase and activation of p53, p21 and 14-3-3σ.

28444443438	Sylvian fissure dermoid cyst with intratumoral hemorrhage: Case report	It is rare for a dermoid cyst to develop intratumoral hemorrhage. A 61-year-old woman had a sudden-onset left hemiparesis and slow response to verbal requests for one week when unenhanced computed tomography scanning revealed a mixed iso- and hypo-dense heterogeneous lesion in the right fronto-temporal area. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a mixed hyper- and hypo-intense tumor in the right fronto-temporal area. The tumor became hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI and was faintly enhanced at tumor periphery on T1-weighted MRI. The tumor was excised and pathological examination revealed a dermoid cyst with intratumoral hemorrhage. The post-operative course was complicated by hemorrhage in the tumor bed, which was evacuated immediately. The patient improved and could walk without support two weeks after the second operation. After 1 year of follow-up, she was well and without neurological deficits. To the best of our knowledge after a literature review, only two previous cases of dermoid cyst have featured intratumoral hemorrhage. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

3042770922	Fetal bovine serum suppresses apoptosis in the small intestine after total ischemia and reperfusion in mice	Background/Purpose Total ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the small intestine induces cellular apoptosis. In this study, the authors investigated the effects of fetal bovine serum (FBS) on apoptosis and related proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors in the I/R-injured small intestine of mice. Methods The mice underwent total I/R of the small intestine and were treated with oral gavages of normal saline or FBS for 3 days, concluding with total ischemia of the small intestine. Samples of the I/R-injured small intestine, representing various predefined time-points post-I/R (immediately before and after 1 hour of total ischemia and at 1, 6, and 24 hours after initiation of reperfusion), were subjected to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to study the cellular apoptosis, and Western blot analysis to measure expression of p53, bcl-2 and bax, with caspase-activity assay used to determine the activity of caspase 3. Results For the saline-treated mice, increased cellular apoptosis, suppressed expression of p53 and bcl-2 (with decreased bcl-2 to bax ratio) and increased caspase-3 activity were found for the I/R-injured small intestine. By contrast, FBS treatment suppressed cellular apoptosis, producing up-regulation of p53 and bcl-2 (with increased bcl-2 to bax ratio to 5.4-fold of the saline-treated group) and inhibiting the activity of caspase 3 (P < .05). Conclusions The results of our study suggest that I/R-induced apoptosis of the mouse small intestine may be related to p53 and bcl-2 suppression (with decreased bcl-2 to bax ratio) and activation of caspase 3 and that such apoptosis seems to be suppressed by FBS treatment. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

30544433417	Cell saver does not increase pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and expression of adhesive molecules in the salvaged blood of patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery	Background: Autotransfusion has been developed to avoid the risks of contaminating with infectious diseases and susceptivity to other complications of allogeneic blood transfusion. Previous studies have shown significant pro-inflammatory cytokine release and complement activation during blood salvage with cell saver (CS) in the course of on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Because both extracorporeal pump and CS machine are possible to induce the adverse cytokines release, thus, in this study, we investigated the influence of CS alone on the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the expression of leukocyte surface antigens in patients undergoing off-pump CABG. Methods: Thirty patients proposed to undergo off-pump CABG were enrolled in this study. Five perioperative blood samples (peripheral blood before operation, blood in pericardial sac at operation, blood in the cell saver container, blood in the blood bag before transfusion, and peripheral blood one hour after operation) were obtained from each patient. The expression of activated leukocyte adhesive molecules (CD11b and CD18) and cytokine-inducible leukocyte-endothelial adhesive molecule (CD62P) were studied by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to determine the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8. Results: All blood samples except the one obtained one hour after operation showed no difference of the expression of CD11b, and CD62P and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 (P > 0.05). However, the expression of CD18 was decreased during the course of blood salvage. The peripheral blood obtained one hour after operation had significantly higher expression of the three tested leukocyte surface antigens and higher levels of three studied cytokines (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Our investigation indicated that the blood processing in cell saver alone did not increase the expression of either CD11b, CD18, or CD62P, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8. The results suggest that cell saver seems not to significantly activate the leukocytes or cause inflammatory responses in the salvaged blood.

3042568754	Resveratrol-induced cellular apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in neuroblastoma cells and antitumor effects on neuroblastoma in mice	Background The prognosis of neuroblastoma patients remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, developing an effective treatment strategy is important. Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, possesses chemopreventive and antitumor effects. We investigated the effects of resveratrol on the proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle alteration of neuroblastoma cells and determined its effects on neuroblastoma tumors in mice. Methods Cytotoxic effects, cellular apoptosis, and alterations in the cell cycle were determined in neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells exposed for varying lengths of time to a series of resveratrol concentrations. Expression of associated cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin E and p21, was detected by Western blot analysis, and the antitumor effects of resveratrol were investigated by treating subcutaneous neuroblastoma tumors with intraperitoneal injections of 40 mg/kg resveratrol daily for 28 days. Results Resveratrol exerted cytotoxic effects on neuroblastoma cells. After resveratrol treatment, the apoptosis rate of the neuroblastoma cells significantly increased, a significant accumulation of cells occurred at the S phase of the cell cycle, p21 was downregulated, and cyclin E was upregulated. In addition, resveratrol treatment suppressed the growth rate of subcutaneous neuroblastomas, resulting in 70% long-term survival. Conclusion Resveratrol caused significant cytotoxicity and increased apoptosis and S-phase accumulation of neuroblastoma cells. S-phase accumulation was related to the down-regulation of p21 and up-regulation of cyclin E. In addition, resveratrol exerted antitumor effects on neuroblastomas in mice. Thus, resveratrol shows promise for the treatment of neuroblastoma.

3242766781	Calcified chronic subdural hematoma - Case report	Chronic subdural hematoma (CSH) is a well-known disease entity; however, calcified chronic subdural hematoma (CCSH) is uncommon. We report on a 59-year-old man who had sudden onset of left hemiplegia one year before admission. Brain CT scan showed right thalamic hemorrhage and one large calcified subdural hemaotma over the right fronto-temporo-parietal area. No surgical intervention was done then. He had a regular rehabilitation program and his muscle power improved gradually. However progressive deterioration in left side muscle power and left hemibody numbness was noted recently. He could not walk and needed to use a wheel chair. Unenhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a CSH with calcified capsule over the right fronto-temporo-parietal area and the hematoma had a marked mass effect. He underwent surgery and the CCSH was excised totally. The patient recovered well. He could walk with a quadricane soon after surgery. He is improving after one year and 2 months of follow up. We feel surgical treatment for CCSH is feasible and often results in neurological improvement.

33645802631	Resveratrol suppresses angiogenesis in gliomas: Evaluation by color Doppler ultrasound	Background: The effects of resveratrol (a natural polyphenol) on angiogenesis in rat gliomas were investigated by color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS). The correlation among the tumor growth rate, macroscopic angiogenesis measured by CDUS and microscopic angiogenesis was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Materials and Methods: Fischer rats were subcutaneously inoculated with rat RT-2 glioma cells and treated with resveratrol for 4 weeks. The tumor size was measured and the animal survival followed. CDUS examination was used to measure tumor blood flow shown as the color Doppler vascularity index (CDVI). Immunohistochemical staining of CD31 was carried out to assess the microvessel density (MVD) of the tumors. The CDVI, MVD and tumor size were correlated. Results: Rats treated with resveratrol (40 mg/kg/day) had slower tumor growth rates than those of the control groups (p<0.05). The CDVI, MVD and tumor size were significantly correlated (linear regression, p<0.0001). Conclusion: Resveratrol-suppressed glioma growth was significantly correlated with the inhibition of macroscopic and microscopic angiogenesis.

33645300066	Effects of irradiated tumor vaccine and infusion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-12 on established gliomas in rats	Purpose: We investigated granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) infused into the injection site of irradiated tumor vaccine (TV) as therapy for gliomas. Methods: Rats with subcutaneous RT-2 gliomas were treated with irradiated TV and/or subcutaneous infusion of GM-CSF and/or IL-12 via osmotic minipump 5 days after tumor-cell inoculation. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cell activity were analyzed to investigate immune responses. Rats with intracerebral gliomas were treated with irradiated TV and infused GM-CSF/IL-12 3 days after tumor-cell inoculation. Tumor growth rates and animal survival were followed. Survivors were re-challenged with wild-type RT-2 cells subcutaneously or intracerebrally to study long-term anti-tumor immunity. Results: Rats with subcutaneous gliomas treated with GM-CSF and IL-12 or TV plus GM-CSF or IL-12 did not have increased survival rate (P > 0.2), but did have prolonged survival time (P < 0.05); in contrast, rats treated with TV plus GM-CSF/IL-12 had increased survival rate (P < 0.05) and prolonged survival time (P < 0.05) compared with controls. These treatment strategies showed enhanced CTL and NK cell activities. Rats with intra-cerebral gliomas treated with TV plus GM-CSF/IL-12 did not have increased survival rate (P = 0.11), but did have prolonged survival time (P < 0.0001). Survivors in each group were re-challenged with wild-type RT-2 cells, and all had long-term survival. Conclusions: Irradiated TV plus continuous localized infusion of GM-CSF/IL-12 may induce a tumor-specific anti-tumor immune response on established subcutaneous or intra-cerebral gliomas, and such a treatment strategy deserves consideration as adjuvant treatment for glioma. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

33745591646	GL331, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, induces radiosensitization of human glioma cells	Background: GL331 is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and its effects on cultured human T98G glioma cells were investigated in this study. The effects of combined GL331 and radiation treatment on human T98G glioma cells were also examined. Materials and Methods: The glioma cells were treated with GL331 and the clonogenic assay was used to study its cytotoxicity effects. A combination treatment, using either concomitant irradiation at the beginning or end of the GL331 treatment (designated as the RT-GL331 and GL331-RT protocols, respectively), was used to investigate the radiosensitization effects of GL331. The levels of radiosensitization of various protocols were evaluated by the dose-enhancement ratio and Isobologram analysis. The cell cycle distribution of the glioma cells treated with various protocols was explored using flow-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Results: The clonogenic assay demonstrated that GL331 exerts cytotoxic effects on the glioma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (p<0.001). The combination treatments, RT-GL331 and GL331-RT, increased the dose-enhancement ratio, with a higher ratio for the RT-GL331 protocol. Isobologram analysis revealed sub-additive glioma cell cytotoxicity for the GL331-RT protocol; in contrast, mainly supra-additive effects were demonstrated for the RT-GL331 protocol. FACS analysis revealed that GL331 and radiation caused the glioma cells to accumulate in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle and combination of these two treatments as the RT-GL331 protocol further increased the G2/M fraction of the glioma cells. Conclusion: The induction of GL331 radiosensitization was sequence-dependent, with stronger cytotoxic effects on the gliomas noted where radiation was delivered concomitantly with the beginning of GL331 treatment. Such radiosensitization effects might be, at least partly, related to the increased cell accumulation in the G2/M-phase.

33750992166	Pituitary abscess	Pituitary abscess is a rare disease, but one with potentially high mortality and morbidity. We present a 46-year-old man with progressive visual disturbance and general malaise for 1 year. Endocrine studies revealed hypopituitarism, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a pituitary lesion with suprasellar extension. We attempted to excise the lesion using a transsphenoidal approach, but pus in the pituitary fossa was found at operation, and no tumour was identified. The culture yielded coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Antibiotics were administered for 3 weeks, and the patient made a good postoperative recovery. He required life-long hormone replacement therapy. After one and a half years of follow-up, he was well and had no evidence of focal or systemic infection. We review the literature regarding pituitary abscess and discuss the appropriate treatment and possible pathological mechanism. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34547763340	Celecoxib increased expression of 14-3-3σ and induced apoptosis of glioma cells	Background: Celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, has been found to inhibit the proliferation of several kinds of cancer cells; however, the effects of celecoxib on glioma cells are not clear. Materials and Methods: A172 glioma cells were treated with various concentrations of celecoxib for 4, 24 or 48 h. Cytotoxic drug effects were studied by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide)-based colorimetric assay, and celecoxib-induced apoptosis of glioma cells was investigated by FACScan. Western blot analysis was used to study celecoxib effects on the expression of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), p53, p21, 14-3-4σ, Bcl-2 and Box. Caspace-3 activity in glioma cells was analyzed by caspase activity assay. Results: Celecoxib exerted cytotoxic effects upon and induced apoptosis of the A172 glioma cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner (p<0.05). Celecoxib had no effects on expression of MAPKs, Box, or p21; however, it increased expression of p53 and 14-3-4σ, and reduced expression of Bcl-2. Celecoxib also increased the activity of caspace-3 in glioma cells. The apoptotic fraction of A172 cells induced by 24-h treatment with 100 μM celecoxib was reduced from 39% to 23% by pretreatment with caspace-3 inhibitor (DEVD-CHO) (p<0.001). Conclusion: The results suggest that celecoxib induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in this line of glioma cells and that such effects might be related to activation of p53 and 14-3-3σ, reduced Bcl-2 and Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and increased caspace-3 activity.

3543081026	Comparison of critical conservative treatment versus emergency operation in children with ruptured appendicitis with tumor formation	Background and Purpose: Management of ruptured appendicitis with tumor formation in children includes emergency appendectomy or initial conservative treatment, the choice of which remains contreversial. This study compared the clinical courses of children with ruptured appendicitis with tumor formation (RATF) who received emergency appendectomy or initial conservative management. Methods: A restrospective study was conducted of 59 pediatric patients with RATF treated from January 1996 to September 2002. Twenty seven patients received emergency appendectomy and 32 patients received initial conservative treatment. Patients who received initial conservative treatment were further divided into those who recovered from the initial conservative treatment (n = 23) and those 9 patients who failed initial conservative treatment and received appendectomy at the same admission. Clinical factors including age, gender, body weight, duration of symptoms, duration of ileus after initial treatment, duration of fever and the usage of antibiotics, hospital stays, and major and minor complications were compared between groups. Results: The emergency appendectomy group and initial conservative treatment group had similar distributions of age, gender, body weight, and duration of symptoms. Patients who received emergency appendectomy had a shorter duration of fever (2.7 ± 1.9 vs 8.0 ± 7.0 days; π = 0.003) but were fed later (4.4 ± 3.9 vs 1.8 ± 2.9 days; π = 0.005) compared with those who received conservative treatment initially. Patients who received emergency appendectomy also had a higher complication rate (33.3% vs 17.4%; π = 0.038). Patients who recovered from initial conservative treatment were fed earlier after operation (0.7 ± 0.6 vs 4.2 ± 4.1 days; π = 0.002), had a lower complication rate (33.3% vs 4.3%; π = 0.02) and a shorter hospital stay (16.6 ± 10.9 vs 29.3 ± 33.6 days; π = 0.03) than those who failed initial conservative treatment. Histophatological study of the appendix in the 17 patients who received interval appendectomy showed fecal materials (58.8%) and fecoliths (29.4%) in lumen, microscopically suppurative inflammation (31.3%) and focal mild inflammation (31.3%). Conclusions: In this study, conservative treatment of RATF in children was associated with a lower complication rate. Pathological analysis of the appendix suggests that interval appendectomy should be advocated in patients with successful initial conservative treatment.

3342984093	Gastrocolocutaneous fistula in a child with congenital short bowel syndrome: A rare complication of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy	Gastrocolocutaneous fistula is a rare major complication of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). We report a case of this complication in a 2-year-old boy with congenital short bowel syndrome with dilated bowel loops who underwent PEG insertion. Fever developed and stool-like substance was discharged from the gastrostomy tube 1 year later. Further upper gastrointestinal study and panendoscopy revealed a gastrocolonic and colocutaneous fistula. He underwent laparotomy to close the fistula. The recovery was uneventful and he was discharged 10 days after surgery. This case suggests that a previous history of abdominal surgery or dilated bowel loops should be a relative contrindication to PEG procedure. Open surgical gastrostomy is recommended for such patients.

40549134941	Investigating complex patterns of blocked intestinal artery blood pressure signals by empirical mode decomposition and linguistic analysis	In this investigation, surgical operations of blocked intestinal artery have been conducted on pigs to simulate the condition of acute mesenteric arterial occlusion. The empirical mode decomposition method and the algorithm of linguistic analysis were applied to verify the blood pressure signals in simulated situation. We assumed that there was some information hidden in the high-frequency part of the blood pressure signal when an intestinal artery is blocked. The empirical mode decomposition method (EMD) has been applied to decompose the intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from a complex time series. But, the end effects and phenomenon of intermittence damage the consistence of each IMF. Thus, we proposed the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition method (CEEMD) to solve the problems of end effects and the phenomenon of intermittence. The main wave of blood pressure signals can be reconstructed by the main components, identified by Monte Carlo verification, and removed from the original signal to derive a riding wave. Furthermore, the concept of linguistic analysis was applied to design the blocking index to verify the pattern of riding wave of blood pressure using the measurements of dissimilarity. Blocking index works well to identify the situation in which the sampled time series of blood pressure signal was recorded. Here, these two totally different algorithms are successfully integrated and the existence of the existence of information hidden in high-frequency part of blood pressure signal has been proven. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84867492349	Micro-RNA-21 regulates the sensitivity to cisplatin in human neuroblastoma cells	Background/purpose: Drug resistance often causes treatment failure in neuroblastomas. Increasing evidence has implicated that the micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the development of drug resistance. In this report, we aimed to investigate the role of miRNA in cisplatin resistance of neuroblastoma cells. Materials and methods: The cell viability of the neuroblastoma cells after cisplatin treatment was analyzed. The expression of the miRNAs and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) messenger RNA in the neuroblastoma cells was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Overexpression of miRNA or suppression of miRNA expression by antagomir was used to investigate the effects of miRNA on the cisplatin-induced cell death or proliferation. Results: The expression of miR-21 was increased in the cisplatin-resistant (CisR) neuroblastoma cells as compared with the parental cells, and the antagomir against miR-21 converted the resistant cells into sensitive ones. Ectopic expression of pre-miR-21 in parental cells resulted in decreased sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. In addition, overexpression of pre-miR-21 markedly increa sed the proliferation rate of neuroblastoma cells. The level of PTEN messenger RNA and protein in the CisR cells was lower than that in the parental cells. Transfection of pre-miR-21 into the parental cells reduced the PTEN expression, and transfection of anti-miR-21 into the CisR cells increased the PTEN expression. Conclusion: Micro-RNA-21 regulated the drug resistance and proliferation in neuroblastoma cells. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

56649103734	A novel blocking index based on similarity measurement applied in distinguishing the patterns of blood pressure signals at dynamically transitional situation	Acute mesenteric arterial occlusion is an abdominal catastrophe that carries high morbidity and mortality. The poor outcomes of this disease process are caused by the delay in initiating therapy because of the difficulties in making an accurate and timely diagnosis. In this study, we tried to conduct patterns analysis on blood pressure (BP) signal under simulated situation using an innovative measurement of similarity. The simulations of intestinal artery occlusion were conducted to two young healthy pigs to generate the recordings of blood pressure signals in dynamically transitional situation. Based on the distance measurement of similarity, non-clamping, non-relaxing, and blocking indexes are defined. Moreover, blocking index (BI) performs a good indicator for verifying the pattern of BP signal under the situation of clamping or relaxing. Finally, the analysis results show the feasibility of pattern analysis for identifying the underlying condition of circularity system. © 2008 National Taiwan University.

64249171902	Tetrandrine suppresses tumor growth and angiogenesis of gliomas in rats	Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has antitumor effects against some cancers, but its effects on gliomas are unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of tetrandrine on the growth and angiogenesis of rat RT-2 gliomas. We treated RT-2 glioma cells with tetrandrine and then measured cytotoxicity, apoptosis and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We also examined the cytotoxic effect of tetrandrine on the ECV304 human umbilical vein endothelial cells and the effects of tetrandrine on the in vivo angiogenesis. Tumor size and animal survival were followed in tetrandrine-treated rats with subcutaneous or intracerebral gliomas. Expression of CD31 in tetrandrine-treated gliomas was followed to study its effect on glioma-induced angiogenesis. Tetrandrine had cytotoxic effects and induced apoptosis of glioma cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Tetrandrine also inhibited the expression of VEGF in glioma cells, induced cytotoxicity effect on the ECV304 cells and suppressed the in vivo angiogenesis. Tetrandrine (150 mg/kg/day) had significant antitumor effects on subcutaneous tumors and led to slower tumor growth rate, longer animal survival time and higher animal survival (p < 0.05). Tetrandrine also affected intracerebral tumors and prolonged animal survival (p < 0.05) without affecting survival rate. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that the subcutaneous gliomas from tetrandrine-treated rats had fewer microvessel densities than control rats (p = 0.01). The results demonstrate that tetrandrine is cytotoxic to RT-2 glioma cells, has antitumor effects on subcutaneous and intracerebral gliomas, and inhibits angiogenesis in subcutaneous gliomas. Tetrandrine has potential as a treatment for gliomas. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

67651171433	Tetrandrine increased the survival rate of mice with lipopolysaccharide- induced endotoxemia	BACKGROUNDS: Endotoxemia usually causes significant morbidity and mortality, and treatment of endotoxemia is often ineffective. The effects of tetrandrine (a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia were investigated in mice. METHODS: The peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with LPS and treated with or without tetrandrine. The amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 secreted by peritoneal macrophages were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS to induce endotoxemia and were treated or not treated with oral gavage with 150 mg/kg tetrandrine 1 hour before or after LPS injection. The survival rate of the mice was determined after they were treated with various regiments. The amounts of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 in the serum of the mice were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) concentration was studied by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Tetrandrine suppressed the LPS-induced increase of TNF-α, IL-1β, and HMGB1 secretion by peritoneal macrophages but did not affect the IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations. The animals treated with tetrandrine either 1 hour before or after LPS injection had a 100% survival rate, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (40%) (p = 0.005). The LPS-induced increase in serum TNF-α, IL-1β, and HMGB1 concentrations was reduced by tetrandrine treatment administered either 1 hour before or after LPS injection (p < 0.0001). In contrast, tetrandrine prolonged the LPS-induced elevation in serum IL-10 concentrations only mildly changed the serum IL-6 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Tetrandrine treatment either 1 hour before or 1 hour after LPS injection reduced the mortality rate of the mice with LPS-induced endotoxemia. The effects of tetrandrine on LPS-induced endotoxemia might be related to the suppression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and HMGB1 concentrations. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

68549109512	Effects of tetrandrine plus radiation on neuroblastoma cells	Background: Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has cancer cell cytotoxicity. The effects of combined tetrandrine and radiation, alone or combined, on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were examined. Materials and Methods: A combination treatment, using either concomitant irradiation at the beginning or end of the tetrandrine treatment (designated as the RT-Tet and Tet-RT protocols, respectively), was used to investigate radio sensitization by tetrandrine. The level of radiosensitization was evaluated by the dose-enhancement ratio and isobologram analysis. The cell cycle distribution of the neuroblastoma cells was examined using flow-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. Results: Tetrandrine had a time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect (p<0.05). The dose-enhancement ratio for RT-Tet and Tet-RT was increased, and higher for RT-Tet. Isobologram analysis revealed mainly synergistic cytotoxicity for RT-Tet, but only subadditive cytotoxicity for Tet-RT. FACS analysis revealed that radiation caused accumulation in the G

70449921677	Tetrandrine ameliorated reperfusion injury of small bowel transplantation	Purpose: In small bowel transplantation, the bowel graft is susceptible to reperfusion injury. This study investigated the effects of tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, on the development of intestinal reperfusion injury in small bowel transplantation in pigs. Materials and Methods: Pigs underwent small bowel transplantation and were treated with tetrandrine or a vehicle. Blood and small bowel specimens were harvested at 1, 3, and 24 hours after reperfusion. Histopathologic analysis of the small bowel was assessed for tissue damage. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed to analyze the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and immunohistochemical analysis was used to study the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the small bowel. Myeloperoxidase staining detected neutrophil infiltration in the small bowel and the number of myeloperoxidase positively stained cells was counted. Results: Pigs receiving small bowel transplantation had elevated serum proinflammatory cytokine levels. The transplanted small bowel showed mucosal damage, increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and ICAM-1, and prominent neutrophil infiltration. Tetrandrine administration reduced mucosal damage, serum and tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels, ICAM-1 expression, and neutrophil accumulation in the transplanted small bowel. Conclusions: Tetrandrine reduced the reperfusion injury in porcine intestinal transplantation during the first 24 hours after the procedure. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0035022108	Perforated peptic ulcer in an infant	We describe a case of perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) in a 9-month-old boy. Abdominal distension was the first clinical sign of PPU. Before he developed abdominal distension, the patient had suffered from an upper respiratory tract infection with fever for about 2 weeks, which was treated intermittently with ibuprofen. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed pneumoperitioneum with a football sign. At laparotomy, a 0.8-cm perforated hole was found over the prepyloric area. Simple closure with omental patching was performed after debridement of the perforation. Pathologic examination showed chronic peptic ulcer with Helicobacter pylori infection. The postoperative course and outcome were satisfactory. The stress of underlying disease, use of ibuprofen, blood type (A), and H. pylori infection might have contributed to the development of PPU in this patient. PPU in infancy is rare and has a high mortality rate; early recognition and prompt surgical intervention are key to successful management.

72949109102	Tetrandrine induces apoptosis and growth suppression of colon cancer cells in mice	Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, exerts antitumor effects against some cancers. We explored tetrandrine's effects on colon cancer with cultured mouse CT-26 cells and with subcutaneous tumors. Tetrandrine induced apoptosis in concentration- and time-dependent manner. Tetrandrine increased expression of ERK 1/2 and p38 MAPK; inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced tetrandrine-induced apoptosis; inhibition of ERK1/2 did not. Tetrandrine had significant effects on tumors including slower growth and longer animal survival time and higher survival rate. Higher dose and earlier treatment were more effective than lower dose and delayed treatment. TUNEL staining showed prominent tetrandrine-induced apoptosis of tumors. These data suggest that tetrandrine induced significant apoptosis of cultured and subcutaneous CT-26 cells. Tetrandrine-induced apoptosis might be at least partially related to activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

77956672557	Tetrandrine attenuates dendritic cell-mediated alloimmune responses and prolongs graft survival in mice	Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has significant immunosuppressive effects; however, the effects of tetrandrine on dendritic cells (DCs) and the associated immune reactions are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of tetrandrine on DCs and the effects of the tetrandrine-treated DCs on alloimmune reactions in vitro and graft survival in vivo. Tetrandrine significantly downregulated the expression of CD80 and CD86 of DCs and increased their secretion of IL-10 (p=0.0001). Mixed leukocyte reaction showed that tetrandrine inhibited dendritic-cell allo-stimulatory activity, which was reversed by the anti-IL-10 treatment. An in vivo study demonstrated that tetrandrine-treated DCs prolonged the survival time of skin grafts in mice compared to control (p=0.005) and decreased cellular infiltration of the graft in the histopathological study. The data suggest that tetrandrine-treated DCs cause immunosuppression and protect skin grafts from rejection. The tetrandrine-induced immunosuppression seems to be partially due to increased IL-10 secretion. © 2010 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

78649875624	The potential of tetrandrine against gliomas	Patients with malignant gliomas have poor prognoses, and the majority of the patients have local tumor recurrence after various treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Thus it is mandatory to develop better therapies for treatment of these malignant brain tumors. Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has antitumor effects against some cancers. Tetrandrine affects the cell cycle, production of reactive oxygen species, mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, and reverses multidrug resistance in various cancer cells. Since tetrandrine is a highly lipid-soluble and hydrophobic molecule with a low molecular weight, it may cross the blood brain barrier; thus, it could be used for the treatment of gliomas. Tetrandrine inhibits the large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels and the expression of BK channel has a positive correlation with tumor malignancy grade in human gliomas. Furthermore, tetrandrine also exerts cytotoxic effects, and induces apoptosis and radiosensitization in glioma cells by elimination of radiation-induced cell cycle perturbation. It also has anti-angiogenesis effects in gliomas, and exerts an antitumor effect on subcutaneous and intracerebral gliomas. Tetrandrine is a radiosensitizer and also a multidrug resistance reversing agent. Tetrandrine can probably be combined with radiotherapy or other chemotherapeutic agents to treat gliomas. Nonetheless, it is important to determine the balance between the safety and efficacy of tetrandrine in patients with malignant gliomas before any clinical application. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

0036083562	The effects of cyclosporin A and FK506 on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats	Partial liver transplantation is becoming one of the standard methods for treating patients with end stage liver disease. Regeneration of small parts of the liver plays a key role in long term survival. Study of the effects of immunosuppressants, such as cyclosporin A (CyA) and FK506, on liver regeneration is very important. Male Wistar rats around 200 g were studied. They were randomly assigned into control, cyclosporin A (CyA) and FK506 (FK) groups. CyA (10 mg/kg/day) or FK506 (0.2 mg/kg/day) was given orally to CyA or FK group rats respectively from 2 days before surgery until the day they were sacrificed. Partial hepatectomies (about a seventy percent hepatectomy) were performed on rats in the experimental groups. Then they were sacrificed at 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after hepatectomy. We measured (1) white blood cell and absolute lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood; (2) ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) content in the remnant liver; and (3) 5-Bromo-2-Deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated hepatocyte counts as the BrdU incorporated index. We found that the ODC contents and BrdU incorporated index increased markedly in the early stage after partial hepatectomy. The administration of CyA or FK506 enhanced the increase of these regeneration indicators significantly (p<0.05). We suggest that immunosuppressants such as CyA and FK506 can increase liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in rats.

0036523588	Suppression of elevated plasma interleukin-8 levels due to total ischemia and reperfusion of the small intestine by luminal perfusion with fetal bovine serum	A previous study demonstrated that continuous enteric luminal perfusion of fetal bovine serum (FBS) protects the small intestine from total ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and increases the intestinal mass. In this study, we further investigated the changes in plasma interleukin-8 (IL-8) level caused by total ischemia/reperfusion of the small intestine and the effect of FBS on plasma IL-8 levels. A 3-h total ischemia was induced in a 15-cm segment of terminal ileum and then reperfusion was instituted. Luminal perfusion of FBS was conducted via an osmotic minipump connected to the stomach through a fine polyethylene tube, starting 3 days prior to total ischemia. The rats were killed after 10 and 30 min and 1 and 3 h of total ischemia, and 1, 6, and 12 h or 1, 2, and 3 days after initiation of reperfusion. Plasma IL-8 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results were compared among the FBS-treated and untreated groups. The plasma IL-8 level was elevated from 1 h of total ischemia to 6 h after initiation of reperfusion (P < 0.05) with a peak of 641.5 ± 36.9 pg/ml in the untreated group and 471.6 ± 42.2 pg/ml in the treated group. Luminal perfusion of FBS significantly suppressed plasma IL-8 levels after 1 h of total ischemia and 1 h after initiation of reperfusion (P < 0.05). The results suggest that FBS might play a role in the treatment of total IRI of the small intestine.

0036725735	Effects of irradiated tumor vaccine and continuous localized infusion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor on neuroblastomas in mice	Background/Purpose: Immunomodulatory treatment has been proposed as a feasible strategy for neuroblastoma treatment. In this study, the antitumor effects of a continuous localized subcutaneous infusion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) into the injection site of irradiated tumor vaccine used as a source of tumor antigens on mouse neuroblastoma were investigated. Methods: A/J mice were inoculated subcutaneously with wild type neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells and then treated with 5 doses of irradiated tumor vaccine or continuous localized infusion of GM-CSF (1 ng/d or 10 ng/d) via an osmotic minipump. Survival rates and survival times were compared among the groups. Tumor growth rates and animal survival times were followed and compared among different groups. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to observe the immune response induced by various treatment strategies. Results: Tumor growth rates were reduced significantly and survival times prolonged significantly by the treatment using tumor vaccine and continuous infusion of 10 ng/d of GM-CSF when compared with the control group (P<.05). One mouse treated with tumor vaccine and a 10 ng/d infusion of GM-CSF showed tumor regression and long-term survival, and no tumor growth was noted after rechallenge with wild-type neuro-2a cells. In contrast, using tumor vaccine only, or tumor vaccine combined with a 1 ng/d infusion of GM-CSF was less effective than tumor vaccine combined with a 10 ng/d infusion of GM-CSF (P < .05). Infusion of GM-CSF alone had no antitumor effects. Immunohistologic analyses showed significant CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration of the tumor in the mice treated with tumor vaccine and a 10 ng/d infusion of GM-CSF. Conclusions: The results suggest that an irradiated tumor vaccine combined with continuous localized infusion of GM-CSF may induce a tumor-specific antitumor immune response that can suppress tumor growth and prolong survival. Such a treatment strategy deserves consideration as a possible adjuvant treatment for neuroblastoma. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

79957795987	Laparoscopic reduction of intussusception in children by a single surgeon in comparison with open surgery	The surgical approach for managing intussusception is controversial. In this study, a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing surgical reduction for intussusception over a period of five years was conducted. All patients received either open surgery or laparoscopic approach after failing enema reduction of intussusception. The clinical and operative data were collected and analyzed. Eight patients received open surgery (OPEN group), and 37 patients received laparoscopic surgery, while two (5.4%) of them converted to open surgery. The remaining 35 patients were included in the LAP group. There was no difference in age, gender, clinical symptoms and signs, duration of symptoms, level of intussusception, and complications between the OPEN and LAP groups. In contrast, the operation time and length of hospital stay in the LAP group were significantly shorter than those in the OPEN group (P = 0.013 and P = 0.001 respectively). No recurrence was disclosed in the OPEN group but three patients in the LAP group had recurrent intussusception (8.6%); however, the difference of the recurrence rate between these two groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.40). In conclusion, reducing intussusception with the laparoscopic approach is highly successful and can be performed first for stable patients requiring surgical intervention. © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

80052841735	Optical clearing improves the imaging depth and signal-to-noise ratio for digital analysis and three-dimensional projection of the human enteric nervous system	Background Due to the dispersed nature of neurites and fibers, the microtome-based 2-dimensional histology provides only a limited perspective of the enteric nervous system. To visualize the enteric plexus, we applied optical clearing to avoid scattering in the human ileum to facilitate photon penetration for 3-dimensional (3-D) microscopy of the neural tissue. Methods Human ileal specimens were derived by trimming the donor bowel due to its excess length during the clinical trial of small intestinal transplantation. The pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 was used as the immunostaining target to reveal the enteric plexuses. The labeled tissues were immersed in the optical-clearing solution prior to deep-tissue confocal microscopy. The serial sections were digitally analyzed and processed by reconstruction algorithms for 3-D visualization. Key Results Optical clearing of the ileal specimen led to less fluorescence signal decay along the focal path in the tissue and a higher signal-to-noise ratio of the confocal micrographs in comparison with the untreated saline control. Taking advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio images, we applied software-based signal analysis to identify the presence of the nerve fibers and quantify the signal peaks. The image stacks derived from the serial anatomic micrographs created panoramic views of the gut wall innervations with their associated microstructures. Conclusions & Inferences We provide an optical approach to improve the imaging depth in 3-D neurohistology of the human ileum. This methodology has significant promise in facilitating our understanding of the enteric nervous system in health and disease. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

80053273291	The potential of tetrandrine as a protective agent for ischemic stroke	Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality, with a high incidence of severe morbidity in survivors. The treatment to minimize tissue injury after stroke is still unsatisfactory and it is mandatory to develop effective treatment strategies for stroke. The pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is complex and involves many processes including energy failure, loss of ion homeostasis, increased intracellular calcium level, platelet aggregation, production of reactive oxygen species, disruption of blood brain barrier, and inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, etc. Tetrandrine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid, has many pharmacologic effects including anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects. In addition, tetrandrine has been found to protect the liver, heart, small bowel and brain from ischemia/reperfusion injury. It is a calcium channel blocker, and can inhibit lipid peroxidation, reduce generation of reactive oxygen species, suppress the production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, inhibit neutrophil recruitment and platelet aggregation, which are all devastating factors during ischemia/reperfusion injury of the brain. Because tetrandrine can counteract these important pathophysiological processes of ischemic stroke, it has the potential to be a protective agent for ischemic stroke. © 2011 by The Authors.

84355166598	Comparison of craniotomy and decompressive craniectomy in severely head-injured patients with acute subdural hematoma	Background: Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is helpful in lowering the intracranial pressure in patients with severe head injuries. However, it is still unclear which surgical approach (DC or craniotomy) is the optimal treatment strategy for severely head-injured patients with acute subdural hematoma (SDH). To clarify this point, we compared the outcomes and complications of the patients with acute SDH and low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score treated with craniotomy or DC. Methods: We analyzed 102 patients with acute SDH and GCS scores of 4 to 8. Of them, 42 patients (41.2%) were treated with craniotomy and 60 (58.8%) treated with DC for evacuation of hematoma. The demographic and clinical data were analyzed including patient age, sex, injury mechanism, GCS score, pupil size and light reflex, time interval from injury to operation, types of surgical procedures, intracranial findings in pre- and postoperative computed tomography scan, intracranial pressure, complications, requirement of permanent cerebrospinal fluid diversion, and Glasgow Outcome Scale score after at least 1 year of follow-up. Results: The craniotomy and DC groups showed no difference in the demographic and clinical data. There was no difference in the outcomes and complication rates between these two groups except that the DC group had higher mortality than the craniotomy group (23.3% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Both craniotomy and DC were feasible treatment strategies for acute SDH. The patients with acute SDH and low GCS score treated with craniotomy or DC showed no difference in the outcomes and complications. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84857368905	Scrotal cystic mass as a late presentation of neonatal testicular torsion	We present the case of a 1-year-old boy who had had a right scrotal enlargement for 9 months. He experienced a sudden onset of right scrotal enlargement and irritability at 3 months of age. No testis but hydrocele was identified at 5 months by sonography at another hospital. On admission, an elastic mass in the right scrotum measuring 3 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm was noted. Sonography showed a cystic, thick-walled mass, wherein no testis was identified. Magnetic resonance imaging failed to reveal his right testis along the descending route of the right testicle. During the operation, the mass was found to be cystic with a thick wall, and the cyst contained a yellowish clear fluid. The spermatic cord was connected to the mass and the junction between the two was constricted. The pathology of the cyst wall revealed atrophic testicular tissues, including stromal fibrosis and small tubules that were focally filled with small cuboidal cells. The atrophic cystic change in the testis in this case was considered to be due to previous testicular torsion. Late-stage cystic change after testicular torsion must be rare as a late presentation because it has never been reported in the literature. © 2012.

84864283623	Valproic acid affected the survival and invasiveness of human glioma cells through diverse mechanisms	The effects of valproic acid (VPA) on the viability, apoptosis, and invasiveness of two glioma cells (A172 and T98G) and the underlying mechanisms were studied. VPA induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, and suppressed the invasiveness of both cells. VPA increased the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in A172 cells, but decreased it in T98G cells. siRNA blockade of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK) expression partially reversed VPA-mediated effects in T98G cells, but had no effect on A172 cells. VPA increased the expression of phospho-JNK1 and phospho-ERK1/2 in A172 cells, but decreased it in T98G cells. Inhibition of JNK1 and/or ERK1/2 partially reversed the VPA effects in A172 cells. In conclusion, the effects of VPA (loss of viability, increased apoptosis, and decreased invasiveness) are, at least partly, mediated through the RECK-MMPs pathway in T98G cells and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways in A172 cells. The action of VPA seems to be cell type-specific in glioma cells. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84866152587	Investigating properties of the cardiovascular system using innovative analysis algorithms based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition	Cardiovascular system is known to be nonlinear and nonstationary. Traditional linear assessments algorithms of arterial stiffness and systemic resistance of cardiac system accompany the problem of nonstationary or inconvenience in practical applications. In this pilot study, two new assessment methods were developed: the first is ensemble empirical mode decomposition based reflection index (EEMD-RI) while the second is based on the phase shift between ECG and BP on cardiac oscillation. Both methods utilise the EEMD algorithm which is suitable for nonlinear and nonstationary systems. These methods were used to investigate the properties of arterial stiffness and systemic resistance for a pig's cardiovascular system via ECG and blood pressure (BP). This experiment simulated a sequence of continuous changes of blood pressure arising from steady condition to high blood pressure by clamping the artery and an inverse by relaxing the artery. As a hypothesis, the arterial stiffness and systemic resistance should vary with the blood pressure due to clamping and relaxing the artery. The results show statistically significant correlations between BP, EEMD-based RI, and the phase shift between ECG and BP on cardiac oscillation. The two assessments results demonstrate the merits of the EEMD for signal analysis. © 2012 Jia-Rong Yeh et al.

84865676782	The potential of RECK inducers as antitumor agents for glioma	Reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs (RECK), a tumor and metastasis suppressor gene, is critical for the regulation of the invasive and metastatic activities of tumor cells. RECK is down-regulated in some malignancies and its expression is positively correlated with survival of patients with cancer. Patients with malignant glioma have poor prognosis. Since RECK expression decreases as the tumor stage progresses from less invasive grade II glioma to invasive glioblastoma multiforme, up-regulation of RECK by natural or synthetic agents might be a valuable therapeutic option for glioma. Histone deacetylase inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been widely used clinically and demonstrated to increase RECK expression in cancer cells, thus they might be used as RECK inducers. In this article, the functions of RECK and the role of RECK in glioma are reviewed, with emphasis on the potential application of RECK inducers in the treatment of glioma.

0036938898	Establishment and characterization of a rectal cancer model in mice: Application to cytokine gene therapy	Background and aims: We established an orthotopic animal model of rectal cancer in mice and applied this model to the study of the antitumor effects of cytokine-assisted tumor vaccine. Materials and methods: The CT-26 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells were inoculated into the submucosa of the rectum of the mice to induce the rectal tumor. The tumor growth rate and the survival time of the mice were observed. The cDNA of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was transduced to the CT-26 cell line via a retroviral vector, and the therapeutic effects of irradiated GM-CSF secreting tumor vaccine on the rectal tumor were investigated. Results: All the mice implanted with the wild-type tumor cells had tumor growth in the rectum and died. The mean survival time of the mice was 28.9 days. Two doses of irradiated GM-CSF secreting tumor vaccine administered on days 0 and 3 after tumor cell implantation significantly prolonged the survival of the mice with rectal tumor compared with that of the control groups (P<0.0001). In contrast, no antitumor effect was observed when the treatment with GM-CSF secreting tumor vaccine was delayed to 3 days after tumor cell implantation (P>0.17). Conclusion: The results suggest that cytokine gene therapy exerts an antitumor effect on small tumors and may be considered as an adjuvant immunotherapy of rectal cancers and prevention of reimplantation of tumor cells disseminated during or following surgery. The orthotopic animal model of the rectal cancer in mice could be applied to the in vivo experimental studies of rectal cancer.

0038447241	Non-operative treatment of idiopathic colonic perforation in a neonate	Single bowel perforation without clinical evidence of intestinal obstruction, NEC, or other gastrointestinal lesion may then be diagnosed as idiopathic bowel perforation. Idiopathic colonic perforation in the neonate is rare and difficult to diagnose clinically. Surgical treatment of idiopathic colonic perforation is usually necessary. We present the experience of successful conservative treatment for a full-term neonate with idiopathic colonic perforation. She was a full-term baby who had abdominal distension and bilious vomiting at the age of three days. There was no occult blood in the stool. A contrast study of the lower gastrointestinal tract showed a small perforation at the splenic flexure of the colon on the 6th postdelivery day. Because her condition was stable and there were no peritoneal signs, conservative treatment was given. Feeding was started 17 days after admission, and she was discharged 9 days later. She was doing well after 10 months of follow up. It is advocated that non-operative treatment may be feasible in patients with idiopathic colonic perforation in a stable clinical condition where there is a small and localized perforation and a good facility for close observation.

0037675819	Radiation-induced temporary alopecia after embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations	Alopecia after endovascular embolization of cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is uncommon. In this report, we present a 33-year-old man who developed temporary alopecia after staged embolization of a cerebral AVM. Four days after the last procedure, this patient had hair loss over his right temporoparietal and occipial areas. No scalp erythema or other sign of dermatitis was noted. The hair regrew 2 months later. The alopecia was considered to be related to repeated exposure to radiation during embolization. The experience in this case and review of the literature suggest that interventional neuroradiological procedures may cause substantial radiation exposure to the patient. Therefore, radiation use should be limited to the least amount necessary to complete the endovascular procedure to prevent radiation-induced biological changes and morbidity. Patients should be well informed of adverse effects such as alopecia. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

0038102959	Effects of octreotide on epidermal growth factor receptor, tissue plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor during intraperitoneal adhesion formation	Background. Intraperitoneal adhesions remain a problem after abdominal surgery. Octreotide has been proved to be able to reduce the number, strength, and extent of fibrous bands at and away from the anastomotic site in an animal model of rats with intestinal resection and reanastomosis. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) are involved in this process. Methods. Laparotomy with intestinal resection and reanastomosis was performed on 60 male Wistar rats. All rats were randomly assigned to five groups: receiving no medication (control; C), normal saline (NS), octreotide solution peritoneal irrigation (Oc), octreotide intramuscular injection (IM), and Oc plus octreotide intramuscular injection (Oc + IM). The concentrations of serum EGF-R, plasma tPA, PAI-1 and PAI-2, and the strength of wound healing were measured. Results. The serum EGF-R concentration showed no significant change from the preoperative level in the C and NS groups 7 and 14 days after the abdominal surgery. However, it decreased significantly on postoperative days 7 and 14 in groups Oc, IM, and Oc + IM (P < 0.05). The plasma tPA concentrations were significantly higher than the preoperative level in all groups of rats on postoperative day 7. The levels were higher in groups Oc, IM, and Oc + IM than in group C or group NS at that time (P < 0.05). On postoperative day 14, the plasma tPA concentrations had returned to the preoperative level in group C and group NS. However, the concentrations in groups Oc, IM, and Oc + IM still remained at a significantly higher level than the concentrations in group C and group NS. The plasma PAI-1 and PAI-2 concentrations showed no significant difference from the preoperative level in group C and group NS on days 7 and 14 after the abdominal surgery. However, the concentrations in groups Oc, IM, and Oc + IM on postoperative days 7 and 14 were markedly lower than those in groups C and NS (P < 0.05). The wound strength was significantly greater on day 14 than on day 7 in all groups. Conclusions. In the rats with octreotide irrigation, the EGF-R level was decreased, the plasma tPA concentration was higher, and the plasma PAI-1 and PAI-2 concentrations were lower when compared with values in group C and group NS rats on days 7 and 14 after surgery. The data suggest that EGF-R, tPA, PAI-1, and PAI-2 are all involved in the mechanism of octreotide's action in reducing adhesion formation.

84870864690	Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1-induced cell death in neuroblastoma cells through the microRNA-34a-MYCN-survivin pathway	Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid extracranial malignancy. Increased expression of MYCN, a member of Myc family, is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with neuroblastoma. Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is known to be critical to the survival of Myc-overexpressing neoplasms. In this study, we investigated the effects of CDK1 inhibition on the viability of neuroblastoma cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: We assessed the effects of CDK1 inhibitors on the viability of neuroblastoma cells and explored MYCN-associated mechanisms by using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and micro-RNA quantification. Results: CDK1 inhibitors induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and decreased expression of MYCN and survivin in neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of MYCN mRNA expression caused significant cell death and transcomplementation of MYCN increased cell viability in neuroblastoma cells treated with CDK1 inhibitors. Furthermore, MYCN mRNA was inhibited by CDK1 inhibitor at the posttranscriptional level. The expression of survivin was also responsive to the change of MYCN levels, and according to the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, MYCN bound the promoter region of the survivin gene. CDK1 inhibition caused elevation of microRNA-34a (miR-34a), and anti-miR-34a not only restored the expression of MYCN but also increased cell survival of neuroblastoma cells treated with CDK1 inhibitor. Conclusion: CDK1 inhibition-induced cell death was dependent, although not completely, on the decreased level of MYCN- and miR-34a-mediated, CDK1 inhibition-induced down-regulation of MYCN, which thereby decreased the transcriptional activation of MYCN on the survivin promoter. We propose that CDK1 inhibition-induced cell death of neuroblastoma cells occurs through the miR-34a-MYCN-survivin pathway.

84872825005	Isolated intestinal transplantation for megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome: Case report	MMIHS is a rare congenital disease. It is characterized by distended urinary bladder, small colon and intestinal hypoperistalsis, or aperistalsis with normal morphology. There is no specific treatment for MMIHS, and most patients have to be maintained by TPN, which frequently causes TPN-related liver failure, loss of venous access, or catheter-related sepsis. The prognosis of patients with MMIHS is poor, and most patients die early. Multivisceral transplantation including stomach, duodenum, intestine, and liver has been used for the treatment of patients with MMIHS because these patients often have liver failure. We report an eight-yr-old patient with MMIHS who was treated with isolated intestinal transplantation. She had completely oral intake during the four yr of follow-up. The experience in this case suggests isolated intestinal transplantation may be indicated in selected cases with MMIHS. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84880788914	Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an intestinal transplant recipient	Strongyloides stercoralis is a helminth in tropical and subtropical areas. It may cause latent infection and progress to Strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome, which is associated with a high mortality rate. Transplant recipients under the treatment of immunosuppressant agents are at risk of severe S. stercoralis infection. According to related literature, most cases of S. stercoralis infection after solid organ transplantation are caused by reactivation of latent infections in the recipients, whereas only a few are acquired from the donors. We report on an intestinal transplant recipient who had S. stercoralis infection diagnosed by a larva of this parasite found in the stool from the ileostomy stoma 1 month after transplantation. The donor was considered the source of the infection because the donor was from an endemic area and had marked eosinophilia, and the recipient had no contact history or clinical manifestations related to the S. stercoralis infection before transplantation. The patient was treated with ivermectin and exhibited no evidence of infection after 7 months. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

84880849494	Congenital membrane causing duodenal obstruction and malpositioning of the descending colon	A congenital membrane without intestinal malrotation is a rare cause of duodenal obstruction. Here we present an 11-year-old girl who had suffered from intermittent abdominal cramping pain and vomiting for more than 5 years. The image studies, including a plain abdomen roentgenogram and sonogram, showed no definite diagnosis. The upper gastrointestinal series and small bowel series showed the contrast was static over the third portion of the duodenum and the descending colon pulled up toward the epigastric area. Laparoscopic exploration revealed a congenital membrane extending from the right-side paraduodenal peritoneum through the third portion of the duodenum to the descending colon, which had caused obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum and malpositioning of the descending colon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in the literature where a congenital membrane caused both duodenal obstruction and malpositioning of the descending colon. © 2012, Taiwan Pediatric Association.

84893877771	Cellular Neurothekeoma of the Upper Lip in an Infant	Cellular neurothekeoma is an uncommon benign skin neoplasm and also a variant of neurothekeoma. Cellular neurothekeomas usually occur in the skin of the upper trunk, head, or neck of children and young adults; however, they rarely occur in infants or involve the lip. A 6-month-old male infant was incidentally found to have a tumor in the upper lip. The tumor was elastic, nontender, and movable, and the overlying mucosa and skin were normal without discoloration. The tumor was excised from the mucosal side of the upper lip, and a pathological examination revealed cellular neurothekeoma. Cellular neurothekeoma in the lip of an infant without overlying skin discoloration might delay the diagnosis and lead to wrong preoperative diagnosis. No similar case has been reported in the literature. © 2013, Taiwan Pediatric Association. Published by Elsevier Taiwan LLC. All rights reserved.

12344297460	Intra-retroperitoneal duplication cyst	Duplication cyst occupying the retro- and intra-peritoneal space is a rare condition. We describe a case of duplication cyst in a 13-year-old girl who presented with abdominal pain, vomiting, and a lower abdominal mass. Plain abdominal X-ray films revealed local ileus over the lower abdomen. Ultrasonography revealed 2 double-layered cystic masses over the lower abdomen with a suspicious communicating tract. Mild hydropelvis of the right kidney was also noted. Abdominal computed tomography revealed 2 cystic lesions. One was located at the pelvic cavity just above the urinary bladder and the other was in the left retroperitoneal space. Laparotomy revealed a dumbbell-shaped intra-retroperitorical duplication cyst with a small communicating tract. The cyst was excised without disturbing bowel continuity and the vascular supply. The patient was doing well at 1-year follow-up.
