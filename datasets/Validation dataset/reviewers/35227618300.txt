22544456246	Measurement of |V	We report measurements of partial branching fractions of inclusive charmless semileptonic B-meson decays at the endpoint of the electron momentum spectrum. The measurements are made in six overlapping momentum intervals that have lower bounds ranging from 1.9 to 2.4 GeV/c and a common upper bound of 2.6 GeV/c, as measured in the centre of mass frame. The results are based on a sample of 29 million BB̄ pairs, accumulated by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric e+e- collider operating on the Υ(4S) resonance. In the momentum interval ranging from 1.9 to 2.6 GeV/c we measure the partial branching fraction ΔB(B→Xueνe)=(8.47±0.37±1.53)×10-4, where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic.

We observe the decay B+→ηπ+ and find evidence of B+→ηK+; the measured branching fractions are B(B+→ηπ+)=(4.8-0.7+0.8(stat)±0.3(sys))×10-6 and B(B+→ηK+)=(2.1±0.6(stat)±0.2(sys))×10-6.

33645799703	Improved constraints on D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- Decays from the Belle detector	We report the results of a search for D0-D̄0 mixing in D0→K+π- decays based on 400fb-1 of data accumulated by the Belle detector at KEKB. Both assuming CP conservation and allowing for CP violation, we fit the decay-time distribution for the mixing parameters x′ and y′, as well as for the parameter RD, the ratio of doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays to Cabibbo-favored decays. The 95% confidence level region in the (x′2,y′) plane is obtained using a frequentist method. Assuming CP conservation, we find x′2<0.72×10-3 and -9.9×10-3<y′<6.8×10-3 at the 95% confidence level; these are the most stringent constraints on the mixing parameters to date. The no-mixing point (0,0) has a confidence level of 3.9%. Assuming no mixing, we measure RD=(0.377±0.008±0.005)%. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Combining our analysis with information on charged B decay modes, we perform a full Dalitz and isospin analysis and obtain a constraint on the CKM angle 2, 68°< 2<95° as the 68.3% confidence interval for the 2 solution consistent with the standard model (SM).

34547581966	Study of B̄0→D0π+π- decays	We report the results of a study of neutral B meson decays to the D0π+π- final state, where the D0 is fully reconstructed. The results are obtained from an event sample containing 388×106 BB̄-meson pairs collected in the Belle experiment at the KEKB e+e- collider. The total branching fraction of the three-body decay B(B̄0→D0π+π-)=(8.4±0. 4(stat)±0.8(syst))×10-4 has been measured. The intermediate resonant structure of these three-body decays has been studied. From a Dalitz plot analysis we have obtained the product of the branching fractions for D2*+ and D0*+ production: B(B̄0→D2*+π-) ×B(D2*+→D0π+)=(2.15±0.17(stat)±0.29(syst) ±0.12(mod))×10-4, and B(B̄0→D0*+π-) ×B(D0*+→D0π+)=(0.60±0.13(stat)±0.15(syst) ±0.22(mod))×10-4. This is the first observation of the B̄0→D0*+π- decay. The B̄0→D0ρ0 and D0f2 branching fractions are measured to be: B(B̄0→D0ρ0)=(3. 19±0.20(stat)±0.24(syst)±0.38(mod))×10-4, and B(B̄0→D0f2)=(1.20±0.18(stat)±0.21(syst)±0.32(mod) )×10-4. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

The partial branching fractions as a function of the baryon-antibaryon mass and the polar angle distributions of the proton in the baryon-antibaryon system are presented. This study includes the first observation of B+→pΛ̄π0, which is measured to have a branching fraction of (3.00-0.53+0.61±0.33)×10-6.

35348856980	Measurement of branching fraction and time-dependent CP asymmetry parameters in B0→D*+D*-KS0 decays	We present a measurement of the branching fraction and time-dependent CP violation parameters for B0→D*+D*-KS0 decays. These results are obtained from a 414fb-1 data sample that contains 449×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. We obtain the branching fraction, B(B0→D*+D*-KS0)=[3.4±0.4(stat)±0.7(syst)] ×10-3, which is in agreement with the current world average. We also obtain an upper limit on the product branching fraction for a possible two-body decay, B(B0→Ds1+(2536)D*-)B(Ds1+(2536)→D*+KS0)<7. 1×10-4 (90% CL). In the traditional 2-parameter time-dependent CP analysis, we measure the CP violation parameters, ACP=-0.01-0.28+0.28(stat) ±0.09(syst), Dsin 2 1=0.06-0.44+0.45(stat)±0.06(syst). No evidence for either mixing-induced or direct CP violation is found. In a 3-parameter fit sensitive to cos 2 1 performed in the half-Dalitz spaces, s-≤s+ and s->s+, where s± m2(D*±KS0), we extract the CP violation parameters, Jc/J0=0.60-0.28+0.25(stat)±0.08(syst), 2Js1/J0sin 2 1=-0.17-0.42+0.42(stat)±0.09(syst), 2Js2/J0cos 2 1=-0.23-0.41+0.43(stat) ±0.13(syst). A large value of Jc/J0 would indicate a significant resonant contribution from a broad unknown Ds**+ state. Although the sign of the factor, 2Js2/J0, can be deduced from theory, no conclusion can be drawn regarding the sign of cos 2 1 given the errors. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

A partial reconstruction technique is employed to enhance the signal sensitivity. No significant signals were observed. We obtain an upper limit of 4×10-7 at the 90% confidence level for the branching fractions of the CP violating modes, Υ(4S)→B0B̄0→J/ψKS0+J/ψ(ηc)KS0.

We consider fragmentation into the main charmed hadron ground states, namely D0,D+,Ds+ and Λc+, as well as the excited states D*0 and D*+. The fragmentation functions are important to measure as they describe processes at a low energy scale, where calculations in perturbation theory lead to large uncertainties. Fragmentation functions can also be used as input distributions for Monte Carlo generators. Additionally, we determine the average number of these charmed hadrons produced per B decay at the Υ(4S) resonance and measure the distribution of their production angle in e+e- annihilation events and in B decays. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

Events are tagged by fully reconstructing one of the B mesons, produced in pairs from Υ(4S). The signal for b→u semileptonic decay is distinguished from the b→c background using the hadronic mass MX, the leptonic invariant mass squared q2 and the variable P+≡EX-|p→X|. The results are obtained for events with pℓ*≥1GeV/c, in three kinematic regions (1)MX<1.7GeV/c2, (2)MX<1.7GeV/c2 combined with q2>8GeV2/c2, and by (3)P+<0.66GeV/c. The matrix element |Vub| is found to be (4.09±0. 19±0.20-0.15+0.14±0.18)×10-3, where the errors are statistical, systematic including Monte Carlo modeling, theoretical, and from shape function parameter determination, respectively. © 2005 The American Physical Society.

The first and second error in the branching fractions and the partial-rate asymmetries are statistical and systematic, respectively.

40949128192	Observation of anomalous Υ(1S)π+π- and Υ(2S)π+π- Production near the Υ(5S) resonance	We report the first observation of e+e-→Υ(1S)π+π-, Υ(2S)π+π-, and first evidence for e+e-→Υ(3S)π+π-, Υ(1S)K+K-, near the peak of the Υ(5S) resonance at s∼10.87GeV. The results are based on a data sample of 21.7fb-1 collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- collider. Attributing the signals to the Υ(5S) resonance, the partial widths Γ(Υ(5S)→Υ(1S)π+π-)=0. 59±0.04(stat)±0.09(syst)MeV and Γ(Υ(5S)→Υ(2S) π+π-)=0.85±0.07(stat)±0.16(syst)MeV are obtained from the observed cross sections.

We find no significant signal and set an upper limit of B(B̄0→Λc+Λ̄c-)<6.2×10-5 at 90% confidence level. The result is significantly below a naive extrapolation from B(B-→Ξc0Λ̄c-) assuming a simple Cabibbo-suppression factor of |Vcd/Vcs|2. The small branching fraction may be attributed to a suppression due to the large momentum of the baryonic decay products, which has been observed in other charmed baryonic two-body B decays. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

Differential cross sections are fitted to obtain information on S, D0, D2, G0, and G2 waves. The G waves are important above W1.6GeV. The general behavior of partial waves is studied by fitting differential cross sections in a simple parametrization where amplitudes contain resonant contributions and smooth background. The D2 wave is dominated by the f2(1270) meson whose parameters are consistent with the current world averages. The D0 wave contains a f2(1270) component, whose fraction is fitted. For the S wave, the f0(980) parameters are found to be consistent with the values determined from our recent π+π- data. In addition to the f0(980), the S wave prefers to have another resonance-like contribution whose parameters are obtained. © 2008 The American Physical Society.

We also update the branching fraction B(B+→ΛΛ̄K+)=(3.38-0.36+0.41±0.41) ×10-6 with better accuracy, and report the following measurement or 90% confidence level upper limit in the threshold-mass-enhanced region: B(B+→ΛΛ̄K*+)=(2.19-0.88+1.13±0.33) ×10-6 with 3.7σ significance; B(B+→ΛΛ̄π+) <0.94×10-6. A related search for B0→ΛΛ̄D̄0 yields a branching fraction B(B0→ΛΛ̄D̄0)=(1.05-0. 44+0.57±0.14)×10-5. This may be compared with the large, ∼10-4, branching fraction observed for B0→pp̄D̄0. The MΛΛ̄ enhancements near threshold and related angular distributions for the observed modes are also reported. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

65849270460	Measurement of the e+e-→J/ψcc̄ cross section at s 10.6GeV	We present a new measurement of the e+e-→J/ψcc̄ cross section where the cc̄ pair can fragment either into charmed hadrons or a charmonium state. In the former case the J/ψ and a charmed hadron are reconstructed, while the latter process is measured using the recoil mass technique, which allows the identification of two-body final states without reconstruction of one of the charmonia. The measured e+e-→J/ψcc̄ cross section is (0.74±0.08+0.09-0.08)pb, and the e+e-→J/ψXnon- cc̄ cross section is (0.43±0.09±0.09)pb. We note that the measured cross sections are obtained from a data sample with the multiplicity of charged tracks in the event larger than 4; corrections for the effect of this requirement are not performed as this cannot be done in a model-independent way. The analysis is based on a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 673fb-1 recorded near the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB e+e- asymmetric-energy collider. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

65849309380	Time-dependent Dalitz plot measurement of CP parameters in B0→KS0π+π- decays	We present a time-dependent Dalitz plot measurement of CP violation parameters in B0→KS0π+π- decays. These results are obtained from a large data sample that contains 657×106 BB̄ pairs collected at the Υ(4S) resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+e- collider. For the CP violation parameters, we obtain two consistent solutions that describe the data well. The first of these solutions may be preferred by external information from other measurements. There is no evidence for direct CP violation in B0→ρ0(770)KS0, B0→f0(980)KS0 and B0→K*+(892)π-, while measurements of mixing-induced CP violation in B0→ρ0(770)KS0 and B0→f0(980)KS0 decays are consistent with that of b→cc̄s decays. We also measured the phase difference between B0→K*+(892)π- and B̄0→K*-(892)π+, which may be used to extract 3. © 2009 The American Physical Society.

77955345043	The CMS barrel calorimeter response to particle beams from 2 to 350 GeV/c	The response of the CMS barrel calorimeter (electromagnetic plus hadronic) to hadrons, electrons and muons over a wide momentum range from 2 to 350 GeV/c has been measured. To our knowledge, this is the widest range of momenta in which any calorimeter system has been studied. These tests, carried out at the H2 beam-line at CERN, provide a wealth of information, especially at low energies. The analysis of the differences in calorimeter response to charged pions, kaons, protons and antiprotons and a detailed discussion of the underlying phenomena are presented. We also show techniques that apply corrections to the signals from the considerably different electromagnetic (EB) and hadronic (HB) barrel calorimeters in reconstructing the energies of hadrons. Above 5 GeV/c, these corrections improve the energy resolution of the combined system where the stochastic term equals 84.7 ± 1.6% and the constant term is 7.4 ± 0.8%. The corrected mean response remains constant within 1.3% rms. © Springer-Verlag / Società Italiana di Fisica 2009.

77955353160	Measurement of the charge ratio of atmospheric muons with the CMS detector	We present a measurement of the ratio of positive to negative muon fluxes from cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere, using data collected by the CMS detector both at ground level and in the underground experimental cavern at the CERN LHC. Muons were detected in the momentum range from 5 GeV/. c to 1 TeV/. c. The surface flux ratio is measured to be 1.2766±0.0032(stat.)±0.0032(syst.), independent of the muon momentum, below 100 GeV/. c. This is the most precise measurement to date. At higher momenta the data are consistent with an increase of the charge ratio, in agreement with cosmic ray shower models and compatible with previous measurements by deep-underground experiments. © 2010.

78650528777	CMS tracking performance results from early LHC operation	The first LHC pp collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 0.9 and 2.36 TeV were recorded by the CMS detector in December 2009. The trajectories of charged particles produced in the collisions were reconstructed using the all-silicon Tracker and their momenta were measured in the 3.8 T axial magnetic field. Results from the Tracker commissioning are presented including studies of timing, efficiency, signal-to-noise, resolution, and ionization energy. Reconstructed tracks are used to benchmark the performance in terms of track and vertex resolutions, reconstruction of decays, estimation of ionization energy loss, as well as identification of photon conversions, nuclear interactions, and heavy-flavour decays. © 2010 CERN for the benefit of the CMS collaboration.

78650529467	Commissioning and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker with cosmic ray muons	During autumn 2008, the Silicon Strip Tracker was operated with the full CMS experiment in a comprehensive test, in the presence of the 3.8 T magnetic field produced by the CMS superconducting solenoid. Cosmic ray muons were detected in the muon chambers and used to trigger the readout of all CMS sub-detectors. About 15 million events with a muon in the tracker were collected.

78650567845	Precise mapping of the magnetic field in the CMS barrel yoke using cosmic rays	The CMS detector is designed around a large 4 T superconducting solenoid, enclosed in a 12 000-tonne steel return yoke. A detailed map of the magnetic field is required for the accurate simulation and reconstruction of physics events in the CMS detector, not only in the inner tracking region inside the solenoid but also in the large and complex structure of the steel yoke, which is instrumented with muon chambers. Using a large sample of cosmic muon events collected by CMS in 2008, the field in the steel of the barrel yoke has been determined with a precision of 3 to 8% depending on the location. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

78650583003	Alignment of the CMS silicon tracker during commissioning with cosmic rays	The CMS silicon tracker, consisting of 1440 silicon pixel and 15 148 silicon strip detector modules, has been aligned using more than three million cosmic ray charged particles, with additional information from optical surveys. The positions of the modules were determined with respect to cosmic ray trajectories to an average precision of 3-4 microns RMS in the barrel and 3-14 microns RMS in the endcap in the most sensitive coordinate. The results have been validated by several studies, including laser beam cross-checks, track fit self-consistency, track residuals in overlapping module regions, and track parameter resolution, and are compared with predictions obtained from simulation. Correlated systematic effects have been investigated. The track parameter resolutions obtained with this alignment are close to the design performance. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79951781401	Alignment of the CMS muon system with cosmic-ray and beam-halo muons	The CMS muon system has been aligned using cosmic-ray muons collected in 2008 and beam-halo muons from the 2008 LHC circulating beam tests. After alignment, the resolution of the most sensitive coordinate is 80 microns for the relative positions of superlayers in the same barrel chamber and 270 microns for the relative positions of endcap chambers in the same ring structure. The resolution on the position of the central barrel chambers relative to the tracker is comprised between two extreme estimates, 200 and 700 microns, provided by two complementary studies. With minor modifications, the alignment procedures can be applied using muons from LHC collisions, leading to additional significant improvements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79951493861	Performance of CMS muon reconstruction in cosmic-ray events	The performance of muon reconstruction in CMS is evaluated using a large data sample of cosmic-ray muons recorded in 2008. Efficiencies of various high-level trigger, identification, and reconstruction algorithms have been measured for a broad range of muon momenta, and were found to be in good agreement with expectations from Monte Carlo simulation. The relative momentum resolution for muons crossing the barrel part of the detector is better than 1% at 10 GeV/c and is about 8% at 500 GeV/c, the latter being only a factor of two worse than expected with ideal alignment conditions. Muon charge misassignment ranges from less than 0.01% at 10GeV/c to about 1% at 500 GeV/c. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953270700	Identification and filtering of uncharacteristic noise in the CMS hadron calorimeter	Commissioning studies of the CMS hadron calorimeter have identified sporadic uncharacteristic noise and a small number of malfunctioning calorimeter channels. Algorithms have been developed to identify and address these problems in the data. The methods have been tested on cosmic ray muon data, calorimeter noise data, and single beam data collected with CMS in 2008. The noise rejection algorithms can be applied to LHC collision data at the trigger level or in the offline analysis. The application of the algorithms at the trigger level is shown to remove 90% of noise events with fake missing transverse energy above 100 GeV, which is sufficient for the CMS physics trigger operation. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

79953272770	Aligning the CMS muon chambers with the muon alignment system during an extended cosmic ray run	The alignment system for the muon spectrometer of the CMS detector comprises three independent subsystems of optical and analog position sensors. It aligns muon chambers with respect to each other and to the central silicon tracker. System commissioning at full magnetic field began in 2008 during an extended cosmic ray run. The system succeeded in tracking muon detector movements of up to 18 mm and rotations of several milliradians under magnetic forces. Depending on coordinate and subsystem, the system achieved chamber alignment precisions of 140-350 μm and 30-200 μrad, close to the precision requirements of the experiment. Systematic errors on absolute positions are estimated to be 340-590 μm based on comparisons with independent photogrammetry measurements. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

The identification is unique only if the trigger chain is correctly synchronized. In this paper, the synchronization performed during an extended cosmic ray run is described and the results are reported.

The main goal of the calibration is to determine, for each drift cell, the minimum time delay for signals relative to the trigger, accounting for the drift velocity within the cell. The accuracy of the calibration procedure is influenced by the random arrival time of the cosmic muons relative to the LHC clock cycle. A more refined analysis of the drift velocity was performed during the offline reconstruction phase, which takes into account this feature of cosmic ray events. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

The analysis of data from 246 out of a total of 250 chambers indicates a very good muon reconstruction capability, with a coordinate resolution for a single hit of about 260 μm, and a nearly 100% efficiency for the drift tube cells. The resolution of the track direction measured in the bending plane is about 1.8 mrad, and the efficiency to reconstruct a segment in a single chamber is higher than 99%.

84871443529	A new Boson with a mass of 125 GeV observed with the CMS experiment at the large hadron collider	The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W<sup>+</sup>, W<sup>-</sup>, and Z <sup>0</sup> bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons. The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of the background is about 1 in 3 x 10<sup>6</sup>. The new particle is a boson with spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts. Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.
