1642601566	High-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of liver tumours	High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been investigated as a tool for the treatment of cancer for many decades, but is only now beginning to emerge as a potential alternative to conventional therapies. In recent years, clinical trials have evaluated the clinical efficacy of a number of devices worldwide. In Oxford, UK, we have been using the JC HIFU system (HAIFU Technology Company, Chongqing, PR China) in clinical trials since November 2002. This is the first report of its clinical use outside mainland China. The device is non-invasive, and employs an extracorporeal transducer operating at 0.8-1.6 MHz (aperture 12-15 cm, focal length 9-15 cm), operating clinically at I

16644364409	Extracorporeal high intensity focused ultrasound ablation in the treatment of patients with large hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive treatment modality that induces complete coagulative necrosis of a deep tumor through the intact skin. The current study was conducted to determine the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of extracorporeal HIFU in the treatment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 55 patients with HCC with cirrhosis were enrolled in this prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial. Among them, 51 patients had unresectable HCC. Tumor size ranged from 4 to 14 cm in diameter with mean diameter of 8.14 cm. According to tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification, 15 patients corresponded to stage II, 16 to stage IIIA, and 24 to IIIC. All patients had HIFU, and the median number of HIFU session was 1.69. Safety and efficacy of HIFU were assessed in this trial. Results: No severe side effect was observed in the patients treated with HIFU. Follow-up imaging showed an absence of tumor vascular supply and the shrinkage of treated lesions. Serum α-fetoprotein returned to normal level in 34% of patients. The overall survival rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 86.1%, 61.5%, and 35.3%, respectively. The survival rates were significantly higher in patients in stage II than those in stage IIIA (P = .0132) and in stage IIIC (P = .0265). Conclusion: As a noninvasive therapy, HIFU appears to be effective, safe, and feasible in the treatment of patients with HCC. It may play an important role in the ablation of large tumors. © 2004 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.

20244372393	Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: Treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation combined with transcatheter arterial embolization	PURPOSE: To evaluate ultrasonographically (US)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in the treatment of stage IVA hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. From November 1998 to May 2000, 50 consecutive patients with stage IVA HCC (TNM classification, T4N0-1M0) were alternately enrolled in one of two treatment groups: group 1 (n = 26), in which TACE was performed alone, and group 2 (n = 24), in which transcutaneous ablation of HCC with high-intensity focused ultrasound was performed 2-4 weeks after TACE. The tumors were 4-14 cm in diameter (mean, 10.5 cm). Immediate therapeutic effects were assessed at follow-up with Doppler US and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. All patients were followed up for 3-24 months (mean, 8 months) to observe long-term therapeutic effects and complications in both groups. Tumor reduction rates, median survival time, and cumulative survival rates in both groups were calculated by using the unpaired Student t test and Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: No severe complication was observed after focused ultrasound ablation, and no unexpected side effects were noted after TACE. Follow-up images showed absence or reduction of blood supply in the lesions after focused ultrasound ablation when compared with blood supply after TACE alone. The median survival time was 11.3 months in group 2 and 4.0 months in group 1 (P = .004). The 6-month survival rate was 80.4%-85.4% in group 2 and 13.2% in group 1 (P = .002), and the 1-year survival rate was 42.9% and 0%, respectively. Median reductions in tumor size as a percentage of initial tumor volume at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, respectively, were 28.6%, 35.0%, 50.0%, and 50.0% in group 2 and 4.8%, 7.7%, 10.0%, and 0% in group 1 (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation and TACE is a promising approach in patients with advanced-stage HCC, but large-scale randomized clinical trials are necessary for confirmation. © RSNA, 2005.

0031106920	Targeted damage effects of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) on liver tissues of Guizhou Province miniswine	HIFU can pass through tissues and accurately damage target tissues inside organisms. This article reports on the oriented damage effects of HIFU upon miniswine internal and external liver tissues, and suggests a new conception of the 'biological focal field'. The results revealed that: (1) HIFU can be used to damage accurately liver tissues under the guide of a B-modal ultrasound device; (2) the scope of the injury is connected with sound intensity and irradiation time; and (3) the different layers of tissue through which the ultrasound has passed remain undamaged. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

2342525971	Circulating tumor cells in patients with solid malignancy treated by high-intensity focused ultrasound	The theoretical possibility that exposure of a solid malignancy to high-intensity focused ultrasound (US), or HIFU, could lead to an increased rate of metastasis still remains. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the potential risk of hematogenous dissemination was assessed in HIFU-treated patients with solid malignancy. RT-PCR can demonstrate the presence or absence of specific RNA fragments. On the day before HIFU ablation, 5-mL peripheral blood samples were collected, and again 5 to 7 days after HIFU, from 26 enrolled patients (hepatocellular carcinoma, HCC: 10; osteosarcoma: 16). Total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed to analyze the mRNA expression of (α-fetoprotein (AFP) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) genes. Positive AFP mRNA expression was preoperatively detected in 8 of 10 patients with HCC. In the postoperative specimens, positive expression was also detected in 8 of 10 patients. In 2 patients, circulating tumor cells were found preoperatively, but not postoperatively. Conversely, 2 patients with no circulating tumor cells preoperatively were found to have circulating tumor cells after HIFU. Of 16 osteosarcoma patients, 12 patients had circulating tumor cells and 4 had none. After HIFU treatment, 2 of the 12 patients had converted from presence to absence of circulating cells and the remaining 4 patients remained negative. It is concluded that patients undergoing complete HIFU ablation may demonstrate conversion from presence to absence of circulating tumor-specific marker mRNA, and that HIFU would not enhance the potential risk of metastasis in patients with malignant diseases. © 2004 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

27144503075	The safety and feasibility of extracorporeal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for the treatment of liver and kidney tumours in a Western population	High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) provides a potential noninvasive alternative to conventional therapies. We report our preliminary experience from clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel, extracorporeal HIFU device for the treatment of liver and kidney tumours in a Western population. The extracorporeal, ultrasound-guided Model-JC Tumor Therapy System (HAIFU™ Technology Company, China) has been used to treat 30 patients according to four trial protocols. Patients with hepatic or renal tumours underwent a single therapeutic HIFU session under general anaesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging 12 days after treatment provided assessment of response. The patients were subdivided into those followed up with further imaging alone or those undergoing surgical resection of their tumours, which enabled both radiological and histological assessment. HIFU exposure resulted in discrete zones of ablation in 25 of 27 evaluable patients (93%). Ablation of liver tumours was achieved more consistently than for kidney tumours (100 vs 67%, assessed radiologically). The adverse event profile was favourable when compared to more invasive techniques. HIFU treatment of liver and kidney tumours in a Western population is both safe and feasible. These findings have significant implications for future noninvasive image-guided tumour ablation. © 2005 Cancer Research.

3042651870	Contrast-enhanced ultrasound assessment of tissue response to high-intensity focused ultrasound	We report the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography as an immediate means of assessing the clinical response to high-intensity focused ultrasound (US) or HIFU treatment of liver tumours. HIFU is a noninvasive transcutaneous technique for the ablation of tumours that has been shown to destroy tumour vasculature, as well as to cause coagulative necrosis of tumour cells. As a dynamic indicator of tissue perfusion, microbubble contrast agents have already been reported to increase the diagnostic sensitivity of ultrasonography in the detection of liver tumours. This report documents the ability of one IV microbubble contrast agent (SonoVue®, Bracco, Italy) to delineate the extent of HIFU ablation by comparison of pre- and immediately posttreatment perfusion within the target tumour. Observed changes were seen to correlate well with the ablated volume on histologic evaluation of the treated volume. This is the first time that this imaging technique has been reported in this setting. © 2004 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

33746010225	Heat fixation of cancer cells ablated with high-intensity-focused ultrasound in patients with breast cancer	Background: High-intensity-focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive thermal ablation technique. This study reports the use of histological techniques for the pathological assessment of HIFU effects in patients with breast cancer. Methods: Twenty-three patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer underwent HIFU treatment for primary breast lesion. Mastectomy was performed on all patients after HIFU. By using histological examinations, the surgical specimens were assessed to explore HIFU effects on breast cancer. Results: Coagulation necrosis of targeted tumors was confirmed by microscopy in 23 patients. Tumor cells presented typical characteristics of coagulation necrosis in the peripheral region of the ablated tumor in all patients. However, in 11 of 23 patients, hematoxylin and eosin staining showed normal cellular structure in the central ablated tumor. By using electronic microscopy and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-diaphorase stain, those who had normal-appearing cancer cells were not viable. Conclusions: HIFU can cause the heat fixation of ablated tumor through thermal effect. © 2006 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.

33748556270	Preliminary experience using extracorporeal high-intensity focused ultrasound for the treatment of kidney and liver tumours	High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) provides a potentially non-invasive alternative to conventional therapies. We have been using the extracorporeal ultrasound-guided Model-JC Tumor Therapy System (HAIFU™ Technology Co, China) in clinical trials to evaluate the safety and feasibility of treating renal and liver tumours. 30 patients have been treated (22 liver and 8 kidney tumours), all of whom were available for adverse event reporting. Of the 22 liver tumours, 20 are evaluable for response to treatment; 14 were followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone, and 6 with both MRI and histological resection. Evidence of ablation was seen in 20/20 (100%) cases radiologically, and 6/6 (100%) cases histologically. Of the 8 kidney tumours treated, 7 are evaluable; 2 were followed up with MRI alone, and 5 with both MRI and histological resection. Evidence of ablation was seen in 4/7 (57%) radiologically and 1/5 (20%) histologically. Mild, moderate or severe transient pain was reported by 16 (53%), 7 (23%) and 1 (3%) patients, respectively. Superficial skin toxicity was seen in 7 patients (23%). Renal function was unaffected, and all patients were fit for discharge from hospital the day after treatment. Early results show that this technique is feasible, and carries a low morbidity. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.

33845386327	An experimental study of real-time monitoring of acoustic output in high-intensity focused ultrasound using a PVDF piezoelectric sensor	The purpose of this study is to explore a technique to monitor the acoustic output in real-time of a transducer used in high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. A PVDF piezoelectric sensor was made and located at a specific position in acoustic field of a HIFU transducer. During operation of the transducer, an oscilloscope was used to detect the voltage output signal of the piezoelectric sensor. Results showed that the oscilloscope stably detected the voltage output of the sensor, which was relevant to the driving voltage of the transducer. That meant there was a correlation between the output voltage of the sensor and the acoustic power output from the transducer. It implies that the PVDF piezoelectric sensor can be used to monitor the real-time acoustic output of the transducer and to assure safety and effectiveness of HIFU treatment. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.

33947098989	Host antitumor immune responses to HIFU ablation	The ideal cancer therapy not only induces the death of all localized tumour cells without damage to surrounding normal tissue, but also activates a systemic antitumour immunity. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has the potential to be such a treatment, as it can non-invasively ablate a targeted tumour below the skin surface, and may subsequently augment host antitumour immunity. In addition to thermal and cavitation effects, which act directly and locally on the tumour, there is increasing evidence linking systemic anti-tumour immune response to HIFU ablation. This may provide micro-metastatic control and long-term tumour resistance for cancer patients. The goal of this article is to review the emerging pre-clinical and clinical results suggesting that HIFU ablation may enhance host anti-tumour immunity, and to discuss its potential mechanisms. It is concluded that the systemic immune response induced by thermal ablation may play an important role in local recurrence and metastasis control after HIFU treatment.

34347262058	High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of breast cancer	The noninvasive ablation of tumors with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy has received increasingly widespread interest. The temperature within the focal volume of an ultrasound beam is rapidly raised to cytotoxic levels. HIFU can selectively ablate a targeted tumor at depth without any damage to surrounding or overlying tissues. Animal studies have shown that HIFU ablation is safe and effective for the treatment of implanted breast malignancies. The results from early clinical trials (Phase I and II) are encouraging, suggesting that HIFU is a promising treatment for small breast cancer. Once oncologic efficacy data from large-scale randomized clinical trials are available, HIFU ablation may become an attractive treatment option for patients with small breast cancer, especially the elderly. © 2007 Future Drugs Ltd.

34548272590	Tissue temperature distribution measurement by MRI and laser immunology for cancer treatment	In cancer treatment and immune response enhancement research, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an ideal method for non-invasive, three-dimensional temperature measurement. We used a 7.1-Tesla magnetic resonance imager for ex vivo tissues and small animal to determine temperature distribution of target tissue during laser irradiation. The feasibility of imaging is approved with high spatial resolution and high signal-noise-ratio. Tissue-simulating gel phantom gel, biological tissues, and tumor-bearing animals were used in the experiments for laser treatment and MR imaging. Thermal couple measurement of temperature in target samples was used for system calibration. An 805-nm laser was used to irradiate the samples with a laser power in the range of 1 to 2.5 watts. Using the MRI system and a specially developed processing algorithm, a clear temperature distribution matrix in the target tissue and surrounding tissue was obtained. The temperature profiles show that the selective laser photothermal effect could result in tissue temperature elevation in a range of 10 to 45 °C. The temperature resolution of the measurement was about 0.37°C including the total system error. The spatial resolution was 0.4 mm (128×128 pixels with field of view of 5.5×5.5 cm). The temperature distribution provided in vivo thermal information and future reference for optimizing dye concentration and irradiation parameters to achieve optimal thermal effects in cancer treatment.

The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of performing wide local ablation using ultrasound-guided HIFU in the treatment of patients with localized breast cancer. Methods: Twenty-three patients with histologically proven breast cancer were enrolled in this prospective clinical trial. They underwent HIFU treatment for breast cancer including the tumor and 1.5-2.0 cm normal breast tissue surrounding the tumor, followed by modified mastectomy 1-2 weeks after HIFU. Radiological examination, histological, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) methods were performed to evaluate therapeutic effects in the treated region. Results: Thermal ablation was confirmed in all 23 patients. It included tumor and normal breast tissue surrounding the tumor. Mean values of the largest parallel and perpendicular dimensions, and volume of HIFU lesions in excised breasts were significantly larger than those of the targeted tumors respectively (P < 0.001). Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining showed clear evidence of complete coagulation necrosis in the treated regions. However, no apoptotic cells were detected in either treated tumor or normal breast tissue. Conclusion: As a non-invasive therapy, ultrasound-guided HIFU can induce wide local ablation in the treatment of patients with localized breast cancer. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The therapeutic ultrasound energy is produced by a transducer with a focal length of 160mm, at a frequency of 0.8MHz. The animals (n=6) were divided into a control group (n=3) and an experimental group subjected to costectomy (n=3). Costectomy was performed 1 week before HIFU. There was no difference in the coagulation volume between the two groups. Skin burns accompanied with reddish color and focal edema were observed in two goats. There were no other complications. In the clinical study, HIFU was applied in patients with with ≤ 3 lesions of liver carcinoma ≤ 4cm in diameter. The complications and anti-tumor effects on liver carcinomas should be evaluated. Tumor ablation was complete in 5 of 6 patients. There were no complications such as skin burns and local pain. HIFU did not influence blood chemical findings. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

34548231730	Determination of surface temperature distribution in biological tissues during laser-immunotherapy	An ideal cancer treatment method should not only cause primary tumor suppression but also induce an antitumor immunity, which is essential for control of metastatic tumors. A combination therapy using a laser, a laser-absorbing dye, and an immunoadjuvant guided by temperature measurement probes such as magnetic resonance imaging thermometry (MRT) and infrared thermography (IRT) can be an ideal treatment modality. Temperature distribution inside the target tissue is important in laser treatment. The surface temperature often serves as an indicator of the treatment effect. However, real-time monitoring of surface temperature during laser irradiation poses a great challenge. In this study, we investigated the surface temperature distribution using direct measurement and theoretical simulation. The preliminary results of in vitro and in vivo studies are presented. Gel phantom and chicken breast tissue were irradiated by an 805 nm laser and the surface temperature distribution was obtained using an infrared thermal camera. EMT-6 breast tumors in mice were treated using the 805 nm laser and with different dye and immunoadjuvant combinations, including intratumor injections of indocyanine green (ICG) and glycated chitosan (GC). Monte Carlo simulation for selective photothermal-tissue interaction was also performed for the surface temperature distributions. Our results demonstrated that the tissue temperature can be accurately monitored in real time and can be controlled by appropriate treatment parameters.

37049016878	Changes in Circulating Immunosuppressive Cytokine Levels of Cancer Patients After High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment	Immunosuppression in a patient with malignant tumor is a major obstacle in cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated changes in the circulating level of all measured immunosuppressive cytokines in patients with malignancy before and after high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment. Fifteen patients with solid malignancy were enrolled in this study and an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) method was used to measure serum level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), respectively before and 1 wk after HIFU treatment. Among them, seven patients had distant metastasis and the remaining eight had no metastasis. All patients received one-session HIFU treatment for primary cancer, including complete ablation in eight patients without metastasis, and partial ablation in seven patients with metastases. The results showed that serum immunosuppressive cytokine levels decreased after HIFU treatment, and there were significant decreases of VEGF, TGF-β1, and TGF-β2 before and after HIFU treatment. Compared with the values in the metastatic patients, serum levels of immunosuppressive cytokines were significantly lower in the nonmetastatic patients after HIFU treatment. It is concluded that HIFU can decrease tumor-secreted immunosuppressive cytokine production in addition to its direct tumor destruction. This change may lessen tumor-induced immunosuppression and renew antitumor immunity after HIFU in cancer patients.

39049095104	Temperature measurement on tissue surface during laser irradiation	Tissue surface temperature distribution on the treatment site can serve as an indicator for the effectiveness of a photothermal therapy. In this study, both infrared thermography and theoretical simulation were used to determine the surface temperature distribution during laser irradiation of both gel phantom and animal tumors. Selective photothermal interaction was attempted by using intratumoral indocyanine green enhancement and irradiation via a near-infrared laser. An immunoadjuvant was also used to enhance immunological responses during tumor treatment. Monte Carlo method for tissue absorption of light and finite difference method for heat diffusion in tissue were used to simulate the temperature distribution during the selective laser photothermal interaction. An infrared camera was used to capture the thermal images during the laser treatment and the surface temperature was determined. Our findings show that the theoretical and experimental results are in good agreement and that the surface temperature of irradiated tissue can be controlled with appropriate dye and adjuvant enhancement. These results can be used to control the laser tumor treatment parameters and to optimize the treatment outcome. More importantly, when used with immunotherapy as a precursor of immunological responses, the selective photothermal treatment can be guided by the tissue temperature profiles both in the tumor and on the surface. © International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering 2007.

32144459357	Extracorporeal high intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of patients with solid malignancy	The ideal treatment of localized cancer should cause the complete death of tumor cells without damage to surrounding normal tissue. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is such a potential treatment, which can induce complete coagulation necrosis of a targeted tumor, at depth, through the intact skin. The concept of using HIFU as a non-invasive therapy has attracted attention in medicine for 60 years. Recently, it has received increasing interest as a promising modality for the treatment of localized solid malignancies. The goal of this article is to introduce recent clinical developments in the use of extracorporeal HIFU ablation for solid tumors, including those of liver, breast, bone, kidney, pancreas, soft tissue, and uterus. It describes the physical principles and ablative mechanisms, three-dimensional therapeutic regimes, and medical imaging used in HIFU. Currently, large numbers of patients with solid malignancy are already treated using HIFU, and short-term clinical results are very encouraging. However, large-scale randomized clinical trials are necessary to evaluate long-term efficacy of HIFU treatment for solid malignancies. It is concluded that this non-invasive ablation can be considered as a conventional therapy for widespread clinical use only when the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials worldwide are available. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an ideal method for 3-D noninvasive temperature measurement. A 7.1-T MRI was used to determine laser-induced high thermal gradient temperature distribution of target tissue with high spatial resolution. Using a proton density phase shift method, thermal mapping is validated for in vivo thermal measurement with light-absorbing enhancement dye. Tissue-simulating phantom gels, biological tissues, and tumor-bearing animals were used in the experiments. An 805-nm laser was used to irradiate the samples, with laser power in the range of 1to3W. A clear temperature distribution matrix within the target and surrounding tissue was obtained with a specially developed processing algorithm. The temperature mapping showed that the selective laser photothermal effect could result in temperature elevation in a range of 10to45°C.

The gelatin phantom provides a uniform tissue-simulating medium for analyzing thermal performance under laser radiation. The gelatin phantom gel is used particularly in measurements of thermal reactions in laser thermology. The gelatin phantom is made from gelatin and Liposyn. A special gel sphere with Indocyanine Green (ICG) laser absorption enhancement dye is embedded in normal gel to simulate the dye-enhanced tumor in normal tissue. The concentration of ICG within the dye sphere is optimized using simulation for selective phototherapy. As a first attempt, the concentration of ICG and laser power density was optimized using a temperature ratio of target tissue versus surrounding tissue. The gel thermal performance is also monitored using MRI thermology imaging technology. The thermal imaging shows in vivo, 3D temperature mapping inside the gel.

The goal of this study was to investigate the status and functions of tumor-infiltrating antigen presenting cells (APCs) after HIFU ablation of human breast cancer, and to explore the mechanisms regarding HIFU-enhanced antitumor response. Forty-eight women with biopsy-proven breast cancer were divided randomly into a control group (n = 25) and a HIFU group (n = 23). Patients in the control group received modified radical mastectomy, and those in the HIFU group underwent HIFU ablation of primary breast cancer, followed by modified radical mastectomy within 1-2 weeks. Using immunohistochemical analysis, tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, B lymphocytes and expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules on DCs and macrophages were assessed in all patients. The results showed that APCs infiltrated along the margins of the ablated regions in all HIFU-treated tumors, and numbers of tumor-infiltrating DCs, macrophages and B lymphocytes increased significantly in the HIFU group. Compared with the values in the control group, the percentage of DCs and macrophages expressing HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 was significantly greater in the HIFU group.

60149087146	Increased infiltration of activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes after high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of human breast cancer	Background: Previous studies have shown that high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation can induce a distinct inflammatory reaction with marked infiltration of lymphocytes after direct tumor destruction. In this study, we investigated the status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) after HIFU ablation of human breast cancer and explored mechanisms that may be involved in HIFU-triggered, antitumor immune response. Methods: A total of 48 female patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer were divided randomly into 1 of 2 groups: control group (n = 25), in which only modified radical mastectomy was performed, or HIFU group (n = 23), in which HIFU ablation of the primary breast cancer was performed prior to modified radical mastectomy. Using semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis, tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and subsets, B lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells were assessed in all patients. Expression of Fas ligand (FasL), granzyme, and perforin on TILs was also studied in both groups. Results: TILs infiltrated along the margins of the ablated region in all HIFU-treated neoplasms, and the numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD3, CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8, B lymphocytes, and NK cells was increased significantly in the HIFU group. The number of FasL

70349777985	High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for local treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: Role of partial rib resection	Objective: It has long been known that high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can kill tissue through coagulative necrosis. However, it is only in recent years that practical clinical applications are becoming possible. Since the ribs have strong reflections to ultrasonic beams, they may affect the deposition of ultrasound energy, decreasing the efficacy of HIFU treatment and increasing the chance of adverse events when the intra-abdominal tumours concealed by ribs are treated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of partial rib resection on the efficacy and safety of HIFU treatment. Methods: This prospective study was approved by the ethics committee at Chongqing University of Medical Sciences. An informed consent form was obtained from each patient and family member. A total of 16 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), consisting of 13 males and 3 females, were studied. All patients had the successful HIFU treatment. To create a better acoustic pathway for HIFU treatment, all of the 16 patients had the ribs that shield the tumour mass to be removed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the efficacy of HIFU treatment. Results: Sixteen cases had 23 nodules, including 12 cases with a single nodule, 1 case with 2 nodules, 3 cases with 3 nodules. The mean diameter of tumours was 7.0 ± 2.1 cm (5-10 cm). According to TNM classification, 9 patients were diagnosed as stage II, 4 patients were stage III, and 3 patients were stage IV. Follow-up imaging showed an absence of tumour blood supply and shrinkage of all treated lesions. The survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 100%, 83.3%, 69.4%, 55.6%, and 55.6%, respectively. No serious complications were observed in the patients treated with HIFU. Conclusion: Partial rib resection can create a better acoustic pathway of HIFU therapy. Even though it is an invasive treatment, this measure offers patients an improved prospect of complete tumour ablation when no other treatment is available. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

76749097322	Dendritic Cells Loaded with Ultrasound-Ablated Tumour Induce in vivo Specific Antitumour Immune Responses	Previous studies have shown that high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation can induce a local inflammation with marked infiltration of dendritic cells (DCs). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether DCs could capture and present activating signals delivered by necrotic tumour cells that remain in situ after HIFU, thus initiating specific antitumour immunity. Tumour debris was derived from a mouse H22 tumour model after HIFU ablation. Bone marrow-derived DCs were loaded with HIFU-treated tumour, tumour lysate and mouse serum. Syngeneic naïve C57BL/6J mice were immunised with three loaded DCs followed by a subsequent H22 tumour challenge. Tumour size and survival were then recorded in each vaccinated mouse. The results showed that both HIFU-ablated tumour and tumour lysate could significantly increase the number of mature DCs and the secretion of IL-12 and IFN-γ (p < 0.001). The proliferation of splenic lymphocytes co-incubated with the loaded-DCs was significantly higher in both HIFU-ablated tumour and tumour lysate groups (p < 0.01). Cytotoxocity and TNF-α and IFN-γ secretion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes against H22 cells were significantly higher in HIFU-ablated tumour group than that in tumour lysate group (p < 0.01). After the H22 tumour challenge, a significant decrease of tumour volume was observed in HIFU-ablated tumour group (p < 0.01). However, there was no statistical difference of long-term survival rates among three groups (p > 0.05). It is concluded that DCs can be activated by HIFU-ablated tumour debris and, thus, initiate host specific antitumour immune response after HIFU therapy.

77952696390	Primary bone malignancy: Effective treatment with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation	Purpose: To evaluate the long-term follow-up results of ultrasonographically (US)-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation in patients with primary bone malignancy. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the ethics committee. Each patient or parent (if patient was younger than 18 years), signed an informed consent form before being selected and treated. From December 1997 to November 2004, 80 patients with a primary bone malignancy - 60 with stage IIb disease and 20 with stage III disease (Enneking staging system) - were treated with US-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation. High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation combined with chemotherapy was performed in 62 patients with osteosarcoma, one patient with periosteal osteosarcoma, and three patients with Ewing sarcoma. The remaining 14 patients had chondrosarcoma, giant cell bone cancer, periosteal sarcoma, or an unknown malignancy and were treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation only. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT), and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were used to assess tumor response. Cumulative survival rates were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adverse effects were recorded. Results: High-intensity focused ultrasound ablation guided by realtime US was performed. Follow-up images demonstrated completely ablated malignant bone tumors in 69 patients and greater than 50% tumor ablation in the remaining 11 patients. Overall survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 89.8%, 72.3%, 60.5%, 50.5%, and 50.5%, respectively. Survival rates at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years were 93.3%, 82.4%, 75.0%, 63.7%, and 63.7%, respectively, in the patients with stage IIb cancer and 79.2%, 42.2%, 21.1%, 15.8%, and 15.8%, respectively, in those with stage III disease. Among the patients with stage IIb disease, long-term survival rates were substantially improved in the 30 patients who received the full treatment - that is, complete high-intensity focused ultrasound and full cycles of chemotherapy - compared with the survival rates for the 24 patients who did not finish the chemotherapy cycles and the six patients who underwent partial ablation only. Only five (7%) of the 69 patients who underwent complete ablation had local cancer recurrence during the follow-up period. Forty adverse events were recorded, with 14 patients requiring surgical intervention. Conclusion: US-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation of malignant bone tumors is feasible and effective and eventually may be a component of limb-sparing techniques for patients with these cancers. © RSNA, 2010.

77953375646	Anti-tumor immunity induced by activated dendritic cells with tumor antigen from HIFU-treated tumors	Objective: To explore the mechenism of tumor antigen which is H22 hepatic carcinoma treated with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to reinforce the anti-tumor immunity. Methods: Myelocytes derived from normal mice were cultured with rmIL-4 and rmGM-CSF for 7 days to extract myeloid dendritic cells (DCs), and tumor antigen from HIFU-treated tumors activated DCs and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were obtained by stimulating T lymphocytes with activated DCs, and CTL specific cytotoxicity against H22 tumor cells was measured in vitro. Results: Spleen lymphocyte proliferation rates were significantly higher in H22 HSP70-peptide complex group and B16 HSP70-peptide complex group than those in serum group, H22 tumor supernatant group and H22 treated tumor supernatant group, P < 0.001; but no significant difference was observed between B16 HSP70-peptide complex group and HSP70-peptide complex group, P>0.05. CTL cytotoxicity against H22 tumor cells was 70.0%, which was significantly higher than those in serum group, H22 tumor supernatant group and H22 treated tumor supernatant group, P<0.001, but no statistical difference was observed in CTL cytotoxicity against B16 tumor cells among these four groups. CTL cytotoxicity against B16 tumor cells was 78.5%, and the cytotoxicity against H22 tumor cells was 21.4% in B16 HSP70-peptide complex group, indicating that CTL cytotoxicity original from HIFU-treated tumor had specific anti-tumor immunity. Conclusions: HSP70-peptide complex purified from HIFU-treated tumor is a tumor vaccine. It could play an important role in host anti-tumor immunity by activating immature DCs, stimulating T lymphocyte proliferation, and inducing CTL production.

77955100844	Enhancement of antitumor vaccine in ablated hepatocellular carcinoma by high-intensity focused ultrasound	AIM: To investigate whether tumor debris created by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) could trigger antitumor immunity in a mouse hepatocellular carcinoma model. METHODS: Twenty C57BL/6J mice bearing H22 hepatocellular carcinoma were used to generate antitumor vaccines. Ten mice underwent HIFU ablation, and the remaining 10 mice received a sham-HIFU procedure with no ultrasound irradiation. Sixty normal mice were randomly divided into HIFU vaccine, tumor vaccine and control groups. These mice were immunized with HIFU-generated vaccine, tumor-generated vaccine, and saline, respectively. In addition, 20 mice bearing H22 tumors were successfully treated with HIFU ablation. The protective immunity of the vaccinated mice was investigated before and after a subsequent H22 tumor challenge. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, the cytotoxicity of splenic lymphocytes co-cultured with H22 cells was determined in vitro before the tumor challenge, and tumor volume and survival were measured in vivo after the challenge in each group. The mechanism was also explored by loading the vaccines with bone marrowderived dendritic cells (DCs). RESULTS: Compared to the control, HIFU therapy, tumor-generated and HIFU-generated vaccines significantly increased cytolytic activity against H22 cells in the splenocytes of the vaccinated mice (P < 0.001). The tumor volume was significantly smaller in the HIFU vaccine group than in the tumor vaccine group (P < 0.05) and control group (P < 0.01). However, there was no tumor growth after H22 rechallenge in the HIFU therapy group. Forty-eight-day survival rate was 100% in mice in the HIFU therapy group, 30% in both the HIFU vaccine and tumor vaccine groups, and 20% in the control group, indicating that the HIFU-treated mice displayed significantly longer survival than the vaccinated mice in the remaining three groups (P < 0.001). After bone marrow-derived DCs were incubated with HIFU-generated and tumor-generated vaccines, the number of mature DCs expressing MHC-II

79952045075	Minimally-invasive thermal ablation of early-stage breast cancer: A systemic review	Background: Minimally-invasive thermal ablation techniques provide an effective approach for local destruction of solid tumor. A novel application is the use for treatment of early-stage breast carcinoma. Methods: A broad search was conducted in Pubmed, Embase and the Cochrane databases between January 1990 and December 2009. Clinical results of the relevant articles were collected and analyzed. Results: The analyzed studies were almost all feasibility or pilot studies using different energy sources, patients, tumor characteristics and ablation settings. They were conducted in research settings for the assessment of technical safety and feasibility, and none of those was used alone in clinical practice. Despite many methodological differences, complete tumor ablation could be achieved in 76-100% of breast cancer patients treated with radiofrequency ablation, 13-76% in laser ablation, 0-8% in microwave ablation, 36-83% in cryoablation, and 20-100% in high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation. Conclusion: Minimally-invasive thermal ablation is a promising new tool for local destruction of small carcinomas of the breast. Large randomized control studies are required to assess the long-term advantages of minimally-invasive thermal ablation techniques compared to the current breast conserving therapies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

0036281005	Tumor vessel destruction resulting from high-intensity focused ultrasound in patients with solid malignancies	The purpose of this study was to explore the sequential imaging and histologic alterations of tumor blood vessels in the patient with solid malignancies after extracorporeal treatment of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). A total of 164 patients underwent extracorporeal HIFU ablation of malignant solid tumors. After HIFU treatment, enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), color Doppler ultrasound (US) imaging, dynamic radionuclide scanning, digital subtraction angiography, and histologic study were performed to monitor the response of tumor vessels to HIFU ablation. Compared with tumor images in the patients before HIFU, clinical images showed an abrupt interruption, followed by the cessation of blood flow within the tumor vessels after HIFU treatment. The histologic examination indicated that not only the treated tumor cells showed coagulative necrosis, but also small tumor vessels were severely damaged by the HIFU treatment. The results strongly imply that the damaged tumor vessels might play a critical role in secondary tumor cell death, and then indirectly strengthen the destructive force of focused US beams on tumor tissue. It is concluded that tumor vessel damage can be induced by HIFU, which may be a promising strategy in the treatment of patients with solid malignancies. © 2002 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

80755172582	High-intensity focused ultrasound combined with transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Long-term follow-up and clinical analysis	Objective: High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been used to treat unresectable HCC, but its long-term effects and major prognostic factors remain to be determined. The purpose of this study was to assess its long-term effects and find major prognostic factors to help us select eligible patients in the future. Methods: 73 patients with unresectable HCC received follow-up after HIFU + TACE. The variables of sex, age, AFP level, liver function, tumor location, tumor number, tumor size, TNM staging (5th edition), TNM staging (6th edition), portal vein invasion, ultrasonic pathway of HIFU, TACE session and ablation response were evaluated by univariate analysis. Those variables with significant difference were assessed by multivariate analysis. Results: The mean follow-up time was 11.7 ± 11.1 months (range, 1-60 months). The median survival time and overall survival rates of 1, 2, 3-year were 12 months, 49.1%, 18.8%, 8.4%, respectively. 45.2% patients achieved complete ablation. At the end of follow-up, 51 patients (69.9%) died from tumor progression (27 patients), liver function failure (18 patients), hemorrhage of upper digestive tract (3 patients) and infection (3 patients). 1 with liver abscess, 2 with serious skin burns and 2 with rib fracture were observed after HIFU. On univariate analysis, age (P = 0.017), tumor size (P = 0.000), tumor number (P = 0.039), the 5th edition of TNM staging (P = 0.023), portal vein invasion (P = 0.02) and ablation response (P = 0.000) had significant difference. On multivariate analysis, ablation response (P = 0.001) and tumor size (P = 0.013) were major prognostic factors. Conclusion: HIFU combined with TACE is a safe method with a low rate of severe complications. As major prognostic factors, ablation response and tumor size may help us predict the survival and select eligible patients clinically. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84869128658	A brief review of development of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in chongqing medical university of the past 21 years	Basic research and clinical applications of HIFU to treat many life-threatening diseases such as uterine fibroids, osteosarcoma, liver cancer, breast cancer, and many others have attracted broad interests in global medical communities (Nat Rev Cancer. 2005; 5(4): 321-327; Nature Reviews Drug Discovery. 2005; 4:255-260). HIFU has been considered as one of the most important developing technologies of modern medicine (Nature News. February 17, 2004). Since 1988, researchers and medical doctors in Chongqing Medical University, China have been performing fundamental research, animal experiments, and clinical trials on HIFU technology. This presentation will serve a brief review of this development of the past 21 years. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of this technology, this talk will focused on the inter-linkage of the three aspects: engineering, biology and clinical protocol. Examples of clinical treatments of liver, bone and breast cancers will be introduced; our treatment record shows that patients have survived longer than ten year after treatments. In addition, we also will report on applications of HIFU in the treatment of gynecological non-neoplastic diseases such as nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of vulva, chronic cervicitis and HPV infections.

84870294761	Focused-Ultrasound Termination of an Early Pregnancy in Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta): A Pilot Study	We explored the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of focused ultrasound in terminating undesired pregnancy. A high-intensity focused ultrasound therapeutic unit was employed to terminate early pregnancies in rhesus macaques. B-mode ultrasound incorporated within the system was used to locate and study the gestational sacs of 6 rhesus macaques with gestation ages of 37 to 66 days, and varying modes of ultrasound exposure were adopted in the termination of the early pregnancies of the rhesus macaques. After focused ultrasound exposure, B-mode ultrasound of the gestational sacs showed significant lethal changes. Of the 6 rhesus macaques, 5 underwent complete abortions whereas 1 rhesus macaque underwent an incomplete abortion. The rhesus macaques resumed their menstrual cycles 50 days after focused-ultrasound treatment. The results suggested that focused ultrasound could be safe, feasible, and effective in terminating early pregnancies in rhesus macaques. As a novel physical method, it may be a promising ablation for a potentially clinical application. © 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

Methods: Totally 60 pieces of ox-liver tissues were randomly divided into 6 groups (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 min) according to doublet interval time. Each group was irradiated on the periphery of same ROI with same dose using HIFU. Results: Each group had formed integrated confinement of lesion. The tissue outside of ROI of 2 min group and 4 min group presented coagulation necrosis, when the other groups did not. Among 6 groups, the volume of the lesion decreased, while energy efficiency factor (EEF) increased and the efficiency of irradiation decreased in sequence. Conclusion: With the doublet interval time decreases, the volume of the lesion increases, while EEF decreased and the efficiency of irradiation increases. The best doublet interval time of HIFU peripheral scanning on irradiation of in vitro ox-liver tissue is 6 min.

Methods: HIFU system was set to pulse mode, with 4 Hz pulse recurrence frequency. HIFU with dosage of 180, 240, and 300 J was used separately to irradiate the fresh ex vivo ox liver, and each dosage was divided into 4 irradiance duty cycle-time groups (1%-4%). Changes of ultrasonography and grey value of the target area were compared before and after ultrasonic irradiation. The livers were cut, and the largest damage areas were observed. This process was repeated for 10 times. Pathologic examination was performed on all the samples at the interface of target volume and normal tissue. Results: After PHIFU irradiation, hypoecho regions were found in the target areas, and the difference of gray value was not significant. There was no statistical difference of the same doses of duty cycle-time groups (all P>0.05). The visible damages in liver tissue exposed to PHIFU with 1%, 2%, and 3% duty cycle-time groups appeared as clear liquid flows, while mud sample liquid flows were noticed in duty cycle of 4% group. Conclusion: The changes of gray scale and ultrasonography in the target areas during PHIFU therapy can be used to guide HIFU dosage and judge curative effect of PHIFU.

84874343556	Application of surface 3D model in high intensity focused ultrasound ablation of ex vivo bovine liver	Objective: To explore the application value of surface 3D ablation model using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Methods: The volume of targeted tissue was 40 mm × 30 mm × 24 mm. Using HIFU successive spot-shaped exposures, 37 segments of ex vivo bovine liver were continuously ablated at the depth of 40 mm, 32 mm, 24 mm and 16 mm, respectively. Dose combination was investigated by varying generator power, ablative exposure time, interval time, lesion separation and slice separation. The target tissues were paired and divided randomly into experimental group (surface 3D ablation model) and control group (complete ablation model). The coagulation necrosis range and necrotic degree after ablation were assessed using TTC staining and HE staining. The exposure time and energy consumption in two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: Surface 3D ablation model produced well defined and sharply demarcated necrosis barriers on the periphery of the target regions. The peripheral necrosis ranges in the two groups had no significant differences (t=2.64, P > 0.05). The energy consumption in experimental group at 32 mm and 24 mm focal depth was lower than those in control group, and the energy consumption in experimental group at 40 mm and 16 mm focal depth were higher than those in control group (all P < 0.05). The exposure time at each focal depth had no significant difference between the two groups (all P > 0.05). The overall exposure time and overall therapeutic doses in experimental group were significantly lower than those in control group (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Surface 3D ablation model may decrease the overall therapeutic doses, reduce overall exposure time and thus enhance HIFU efficiency of ex vivo bovine liver at the above conditions.

Methods: HIFU 3D-peripheral scanning was performed on ROI of 20 pieces of isolated perfused pig liver tissue. Visual and light microscopic observation, plain and contrast-enhanced MR scanning were performed before and after HIFU irradiation. Results: Complete close zone of coagulative necrosis in irradiated area displayed in all tissues in visual observation, while the internal area showed no significant changes. Light microscopic observation found nucleus pyknotic and cataclastic in irradiated cells, while edema existed in internal cells, and hepatic sinusoid dilated, the boundary between irradiated and peripheral tissue was clear, with thrombosis formed in interlobular veins. In irradiation area, signals of ROI decreased on MR T1WI but increased on T2WI, while there was no significant changes in internal area after irradiation. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed that the blood perfusion in internal area disappeared. Conclusion: HIFU 3D-peripheral scanning can effectively block the blood supply of the internal area of ROI in isolated perfused pig liver tissue.

84880035213	Tissue ablation accelerated by peripheral scanning mode with high-intensity focused ultrasound: A study on isolated porcine liver perfusion	The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of accelerated tissue ablation using a peripheral scanning mode with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and to explore the effect of flow rate on total energy consumption of the target tissues. Using a model of isolated porcine liver perfusion via the portal vein and hepatic artery, we conducted a scanning protocol along the periphery of the target tissues using linear-scanned HIFU to carefully adjust the varying focal depth, generator power, scanning velocity and line-by-line interval over the entire ablation range. Porcine livers were divided into four ablation groups: group 1, n= 12, with dual-vessel perfusion; group 2, n= 11, with portal vein perfusion alone; group 3, n= 10, with hepatic artery perfusion alone; and group 4, n= 11, control group with no-flow perfusion. The samples were cut open consecutively at a thickness of 3 mm, and the actual ablation ranges were calculated along the periphery of the target tissues after triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Total energy consumption was calculated as the sum of the energy requirements at various focal depths in each group. On the basis of the pre-supposed scanning protocol, the peripheral region of the target tissue formed a complete coagulation necrosis barrier in each group with varying dose combinations, and the volume of the peripheral necrotic area did not differ significantly among the four groups (p > 0.05). Furthermore, total energy consumption in each group significantly decreased with the corresponding decrease in flow rate (p < 0.01). This study revealed that the complete peripheral necrosis barrier within the target tissues can defined using linear-scanned HIFU in an isolated porcine liver perfusion model. Additionally, the flow rate in the major hepatic vessels may play an important role in the use of the peripheral ablation mode, and this novel mode of ablation may enhance the therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of the treatment of large tumors using HIFU ablation. © 2013 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84882426959	High intensity focused ultrasound ablation and antitumor immune response	The ideal cancer therapy not only induces the death of all localized tumor cells without damage to surrounding normal tissue, but also activates a systemic antitumor immunity. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has the potential to be such a treatment, as it can non-invasively ablate a targeted tumor below the skin surface, and may subsequently augment host antitumor immunity. This paper is to review increasing pre-clinical and clinical evidence linking antitumor immune response to HIFU ablation, and to discuss the potential mechanisms involved in HIFU-enhanced host antitumor immunity. The seminal studies performed so far indicate that although it is not possible to conclude definitively on the connection between HIFU treatment and antitumor immune response, it is nonetheless important to conduct extensive studies on the subject in order to elucidate the processes involved. © 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

The results showed that the maximum temperature rise in the center of BFR was 74.4 ± 1.5°C. Temperature rise far away from focus on X, Y, Z-axis dropped rapidly within BFR. Effective temperature rise width (ETRW) was 12.4mm on Z-axis, and 5.4mm on X and Y-axis. The ETRW was consistent with the size of the BFR on X, Y and Z-axis. The sharp boundary between the BFR and normal liver was visible on light microscopy, showing thermal dose decreasing acutely outwards from BFR center to normal tissue spatially, resembling a "knife". So HIFU can accurately, effectively, safely ablate tumor within the body.

84894860084	First experience of high-intensity focused ultrasound combined with transcatheter arterial embolization as local control for hepatoblastoma	The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in treating pediatric hepatoblastoma. Twelve patients with initially unresectable hepatoblastoma were enrolled in the study. All patients received chemotherapy, TACE, and HIFU ablation. Follow-up materials were obtained in all patients. The tumor response, survival rate, and complications were analyzed. Complete ablation was achieved in 10 patients (83.3%), and the alpha-fetoprotein level was also decreased to normal in these patients. The mean follow-up time was 13.3±1.8 months (range, 2-25 months). At the end of follow-up, two patients died from tumor progression, the other 10 patients were alive. One patient was found to have lung metastasis after HIFU and had an operation to remove the lesion. The median survival time was 14 months, and the 1- and 2-year survival rates were 91.7% and 83.3%, respectively. Complications included fever, transient impairment of hepatic function, and mild malformation of ribs. Conclusion: HIFU combined with TACE is a safe and promising method with a low rate of severe complications. As a noninvasive approach, it may provide a novel local therapy for patients with unresectable hepatoblastoma.

Preliminary studies suggest that this approach is technical safe and feasible, and can be used alone or in combination with systemic chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. It can effectively alleviate cancer-related abdominal pain, and may confer an additional survival benefit with few significant complications. This review provides a brief overview of HIFU, describes current clinical applications, summarizes characteristics of continuous and pulsed HIFU, and discusses future applications and challenges in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

10744226073	Extracorporeal focused ultrasound surgery for treatment of human solid carcinomas: Early Chinese clinical experience	The objective of this article is to introduce the early Chinese clinical experience of using extracorporeal focused ultrasound (US) surgery (FUS) for the treatment of solid tumors. From December 1997 to October 2001, a total of 1038 patients with solid tumors underwent FUS ablation in 10 Chinese hospitals. The tumors included primary and metastatic liver cancer, malignant bone tumors, breast cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, abdominal and pelvic malignant tumors, uterine myoma, benign breast tumors, hepatic hemangioma and other solid tumors. In this article, pathologic changes in tumors treated with FUS, real-time diagnostic imaging for targeting, monitoring and assessment of results by follow-up images are presented. Early clinical results and complications of the technique are also reported. (E-mail: mfengwu@yahoo.com) © 2004 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

10744231127	Changes in biologic characteristics of breast cancer treated with high-intensity focused ultrasound	Proliferation, invasion, immortalization and metastasis are the main malignant characteristics of cancer. Previous studies have shown that high-intensity focused ultrasound (US), or HIFU, can induce irreversible damage both to breast cancer cells and to tumor blood vessels. However, light microscopy alone may not always show this clearly. In this study, molecular biologic techniques were used to examine any changes in molecular markers associated with malignant behavior after exposure to HIFU. A total of 48 women with breast cancer were randomized to a control group (mastectomy) and a HIFU group (HIFU followed by mastectomy). Immunohistochemical staining, messenger RNA (mRNA) in situ hybridization and telomere-repeat amplification protocol-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (TRAP-ELISA) techniques were used to detect tumor expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cell adhesion molecule CD44v6, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), erbB2 mRNA, and to measure telomerase activity in both groups. The results demonstrated that there were significant alterations in expression of PCNA, CD44v6, MMP-9, erbB2 mRNA, and a dramatic decrease in telomerase activity in the HIFU group. It is concluded that malignant tumor characteristics are arrested by HIFU, and that biologic factors are potential markers for assessing HIFU efficacy. © 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

11144354898	Extracorporeal high intensity focused ultrasound ablation in the treatment of 1038 patients with solid carcinomas in China: An overview	The ideal treatment of localized cancer should directly cause an irreversible and complete death of tumor cells without damage to surrounding normal tissue. High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is such a potential treatment, which induces a complete coagulative necrosis of a tumor at depth through the intact skin. The idea that using an extracorporeal source of therapeutic ultrasound was introduced more than 50 years ago [J. Gen. Physiol. 26 (1942) 179]. However, up to now, most of the studies on HIFU have been dealing with animal experiments because this extracorporeal technique is very complicated in clinical applications. The purpose of this study is to introduce Chinese clinical experience of using extracorporeal HIFU for the treatment of patients with various kinds of solid tumor. From December 1997 to October 2001, a total of 1038 patients with solid tumors underwent HIFU ablation in China. Among them, 313 patients were treated at the Chongqing University of Medical Sciences, China. Pathological examination showed that the target region presented clear evidence of cellular destruction. Small blood vessels less than 2 mm in diameter were severely damaged. Follow-up diagnostic imaging revealed that there was no, or reduced, blood supply, and no uptake of radioisotope in the treated tumor after HIFU, both indicating a positive therapeutic response and an absence of viable tumor. Imaging at 6-12 months showed obvious regression of the lesion. Four-year follow-up data were significantly observed in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and breast cancer. An extremely low major complication rate was noted. It is concluded that HIFU ablation is a safe, effective, and feasible modality for the ablation of carcinomas. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
