14744292085	Deformation localization and recrystallization in TC4 alloy under impact condition	GCr15 steel balls 4 mm in diameter were used as projectiles to impact different thickness Ti-6Al-4V targets at a speed of 1.5 km/s. Two types of adiabatic shear bands (ASBs) near the craters were distinguished by optical microscopy deformed shear bands; white-etching shear bands. The white-etching bands and deformed bands coexist in thin targets. In two other types of targets, only the white-etching bands were observed. The boundary between the white-etching bands and matrix is very clear. Micro-voids and cracks are observed in white-etching bands. Observation by transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that the white-etching bands contain nano-size equiaxed grains, which confirm that recrystallization occurs during white-etching bands formation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

17044366611	Magnetic stability of Fe-Cr-Co permanent magnet materials at high temperature	Magnetic stability of a Fe-Cr-Co permanent magnet material at high temperatures has been investigated. Changes of microstructures and hyperfine field distributions after high temperature holding were analyzed by transimission electron microscopy (TEM) and Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results of experiments indicate that the changes of magnetic properties of the Fe-Cr-Co alloy tend to decrease, and then gradually keeps a certain level with increasing the holding time at high temperature. TEM observations show that microstructures of the alloy do not change distinctly after high temperature holding.

During making and breaking process, micro-cracks occurred along grain boundaries under electrical and mechanical forces. Addition of cadmium into the composite increases oxidizable capability of this material, and also leads to oxide accumulation along grain boundaries. These factors reduce the reliability of electrical contacts in practice. Arc erosion quantities during commutation operation processes relates with grain size of matrix and particle size of the second metallic phase. The optimal grain size is 20-50μm and 10-20 μm for niobium particles in these tests. © 2005 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

0000822501	Effect of natural aging and preaging on subsequent precipitation process of an Al-Mg-Si alloy with high excess silicon	The mechanism of the influence of natural aging (that occurs between solution heat treatment and artificial aging) and preaging immediately after quenching on the subsequent precipitation process in an Al-0.95Mg-1.55Si-0.3Mn-0.1Zr alloy was studied using differential scanning calorimetric analyses and microhardness measurements. The results show that natural aging has a distinct influence on the subsequent precipitation process. It is proposed that the formation of stable silicon clusters during natural aging is the major reason for such an effect. Preaging at 120 or 150°C for 5 min is effective in suppressing the clustering process, and thus inhibiting the deleterious effect of natural aging. The decrease in hardness due to the natural aging in the alloy studied is not as marked as that reported for balanced Al-Mg

0011121718	Impact fracture of rapid solidification processed Al-Li alloys	The deformation-fracture behavior in impact test of rapid solidification processed (RSP) Al-Li alloys has been studied systematically. The results show that there are both intrinsic and the extrinsic toughening effects in RSP Al-Li alloys. The intrinsic toughening effect is controlled by the micro-mechanism of fracture in the alloys, while the extrinsic toughening is produced by cracking of the prior powder boundaries (PPBs). The level of extrinsic toughening effect is determined by the relative strength of grains, grain boundaries, and PPBs. Large secondary cracks across the transverse section of impact specimens form easily along relatively weak PPBs in the as-quenched condition, leading to a marked extrinsic toughening effect. However, in the peak aged and overaged conditions, cracks propagate mainly along grain boundaries, and the extrinsic toughening effect is inhibited.

0001427611	Effect of predeformation on microstructure and tensile properties of Al-Mg-Si alloys with high silicon content	The effect of predeformation on the microstructure and tensile properties of two Al-Mg-Si alloys with high excess Si has been studied by tensile testing and TEM analysis. The results show that the strength of Al-Mg-Si alloys in the unpaged condition is great increased by prestretching immediately after water quenching. Both the deformation strengthening and the extra precipitation strengthening play important roles in providing the increase in strength. Precipitates of β″ are observed to form directly on dislocations with a larger size than those that form in dislocation free areas. When the prestretching is less than 5%, the increase in predeformation results in an increase in β″ precipitate density, whereas prestretching by 10% leads to larger size but lower density of β″ precipitates.

0031117968	Precipitation behaviour of Al-Mg-Si alloys with high silicon content	The precipitation behaviour of three Al-Mg-Si alloys has been studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy. Seven exothermic peaks are usually observed in DSC thermograms of Al-Mg-Si alloys with high silicon contents. These peaks are believed to be caused bytheformation of clusters of silicon and magnesium atoms, Guinier Preston zones, small precipitates with an unknown structure, β″ phase, B′ phase, silicon precipitates and β phase. The silicon content has no obvious effect on the precipitation of β″ and B′ phases in these alloys, but it has a pronounced influence on the formation of silicon precipitates. The cold-rolling reduction before solution heat treatment is also found to affect the precipitation process appreciably.

0031192233	Deformation and fracture behavior of two Al-Mg-Si alloys	Deformation and fracture behavior of two Al-Mg-Si alloys in different aging conditions has been studied by tensile testing, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. Tensile test results show that the strain hardening exponents (/; values) of the two alloys decrease sharply at the early stage of artificial aging and are only 0.045 and 0.06, respectively, in the overaged condition. The sharp decrease of work hardening rate is believed to be one major reason that results in the rapid decrease of elongation to failure at the early stage of artificial aging. In fully aged conditions, dislocations are concentrated in narrow bands during plastic deformation of these alloys, which is responsible for the very low n values of the Al-Mg-Si alloys in peak aged and overaged conditions. The Si particles formed in the interior of grains of the higher Si containing alloy reduce the inhomogeneous deformation behavior. The TEM results show that large precipitates and precipitate-free zones (PFZs) along grain boundaries are formed in peak aged and overaged conditions, and SEM observations demonstrate that the tensile fracture modes of the two alloys in these aging conditions are completely intergranular with many small cusps decorated on facets of the fractured grain boundaries. Thus, the fracture process of both alloys is suggested to be that in which the high local stresses, built up where the slip band impinges on the grain boundaries, nucleate voids at the grain boundary precipitates by decohesion of the particle/PFZ interface, and then coalescence of these voids within the PFZ leads to the final fracture of these alloys.

The shape of DSC thermograms changes distinctly with increasing natural ageing times: there are seven exothermic peaks in as-quenched condition, while, there are only three for specimens naturally aged for more than four weeks. The reason for the strong influence of natural ageing on precipitation behavior of the two Al-Mg-Si alloys is assumed to be the formation of clusters during natural ageing. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is found that the mass gain and reaction duration of electroless plating process are evidently affected by the initial pH value and bath temperature. Content of amorphous cobalt in the plating layer increases with the increase of the initial pH value and the bath temperature.

The isotropic modulated structure in Fe-Cr-Co alloy formed during isothermal ageing without external magnetic field could be converted to be anisotropy during further isothermal ageing under an 8 kOe external magnetic (thermo-magnetic treatment), and the formation of anisotropy was slower than the direct formation from spinodal decomposition under external magnetic field and is time dependent. The anisotropy characteristic of modulated structure in Fe-Cr-Co alloy subjected to thermo-magnetic treatment for 1 h remained during further isothermal ageing without external magnetic field for up to 20 h. Novel modulated structure could be obtained through specific thermo-magnetic treatment processes, which was confirmed by phase-field simulation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The grain size increases slowly when heat treated at temperatures below the complete solution temperature of delta phase, whereas, the grain size increases quickly. The grain growth dynamics of GH4169 superalloy shows that the activation energy of grain growth is 157.6 kJ/mol when heat treated at temperatures beyond 1050°C. The grain growth of GH4169 superalloy is controlled by the grain boundary diffusion of nickel-based alloy. The equation of the grain growth dynamics for GH4169 superalloy is also established.

36048934464	Effect of original microstructure on the hot compression behavior of superalloy 718	Hot compression tests at different temperatures and strain rates were performed on superalloy 718 annealed at 1100 °C for 30 min as well as 950 °C for 30 min in order to investigate the effect of the original microstructure on the hot deformation behavior. The results show that the δ phase precipitated on the grain boundaries of superalloy 718 prior to hot deformation leads to a decrease of the flow stress, which can be attributed to the drop of the matrix strength. The activation energy (Q) for hot deformation of the fine-grained material with δ phase on the grain boundaries is determined to be 381 kJ/mol, which is much lower than that of the coarse-grained material without δ phase (472 kJ/mol). It is suggested that the initial S phase precipitated on the grain boundaries of the annealed material affect the thermal activation process of hot deformation for superalloy 718, resulting in the decrease of activation energy.

Qualitative description and quantitative characterization were conducted employing electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) technique on the microstructure of typical regions with different filler contents. These characteristic regions were filled at the following stages: ahead of filling (AF), beginning of filling (BF), mid stage of filling (MF) and the end of filling (EF). EBSD results showed that recrystallization fraction during direct extrusion were 8.3%, 13.5%, 9.3% and 11.2%, for AF, BF, MF and EF, respectively. Recrystallization fraction during indirect extrusion were 15.5%, 9.1% 5.2% and 9.9%, for AF, BF, MF and EF, respectively. It shows that the mode and the amount of deformation played an important role in DRX. DRX grains were formed continuously during direct extrusion, while during indirect extrusion, fewer DRX grains generated, and only originally generated DRX grains grew larger gradually.

In the center layer, a typical β fiber texture running from {112} <111> orientation through {123} <634> orientation to {011} <211> orientation was found. Near the surface, in contrast, shear type textures including {001} <110> orientation, {112} <110> orientation and {111} <110> orientation were dominating. In particularly, when the shear type textures reached the maximum in both intensity and content, the β fiber became minimums. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

38349145348	Investigation on dynamic recrystallization behavior in hot deformed superalloy inconel 718	The nucleation and development of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) in hot deformed superalloy Inconel 718 during uniaxial compression were investigated by optical microscopy and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) technique. The results showed that the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization was the predominant DRX mechanism in this alloy. The variations of partial crystallographic orientations led to the individual nucleation inside the deformed grains, which implied the occurrence of local continuous dynamic recrystallization. The progressive subgrain rotation can be confirmed neither near the prior high angle grain boundaries nor within the original grains. It was found that, as the strain increased, the initial twin boundaries were gradually transformed to ordinary mobile high angle boundaries. Meanwhile, the new twin boundaries were formed inside the recrystallized grain necklaces. It was suggested that the characteristics of the twin boundaries evolution with increasing strain were associated with the transformation of initial twin boundaries as well as the generation of new ones, which resulted in the development of DRX.

Quantitative analysis of the microstructure and texture through the plate thickness was conducted.

The results show that the fatigue crack propagation rate of under-aged alloy is lower than that of peak-aged alloy. The effects of aging conditions on the rate of fatigue crack propagation were explained in terms of the slip planarity of dislocations and the cyclic slip, reversibility.

The magnetic moments of Fe and Co atoms in the alloy were calculated by sum rules, and the change of local environment of magnetic atoms after electron irradiation were discussed. It was shown that the larger spin-orbit interaction exists in the 3d orbitals of Fe and Co atoms, and the electron irradiation significantly affected the spin-orbit coupling interaction of magnetic atoms, resulting in the decrease of orbital-to-spin moment ratio of Fe and Co atoms after electronic irradiation. This was found to be primarily due to the effect of irradiation on the electron structure and crystal-field. The variation of absorption spectrum at L edge indicates that a charge transfer occurred between Fe and Co atoms during electron irradiation. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electronic microscopy and an X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer were used to characterize the obtained samples. The notched microspheres were uniform in size and shape, with each sphere containing one notch on its surface. The results show that the formation process of the CaMoO<inf>4</inf> notched microspheres is due to a "two-step" growth process, in which CaSO<inf>4</inf> nanorods are formed first and then CaMoO<inf>4</inf> microspheres are grown on the surfaces of the CaSO<inf>4</inf> nanorods. The reaction intermediate, the CaSO<inf>4</inf> nanorods, acts as a self-template for the formation of "CaMoO<inf>4</inf> sphere gripped CaSO<inf>4</inf> nanorod" structures, and finally produce very special structures-CaMoO<inf>4</inf> notched microspheres.

X-ray diffraction analysis shows that γ -ray irradiation leads to the increase of FeCrCo crystal mismatch and decrease of AlNiCo ordering degree. The investigations by positron annihilation spectroscopy technique show that the defects in AlNiCo and SmCo increase after γ -ray irradiation.

The experimental results show that the adiabatic shear bands beneath the crater are observed, and its width is ranging from 1 to 10 μm. The deformation twins, martensite and intersection between them are observed simultaneously under the crater, which should be attributed to the high strain rate impact. The elongated subgrains with high aspect ratio are found in the shear band, while the melt-related microstructure is observed in the shear band. The heat converted from plastic work continuously increases the local temperature and thus leads to continued softening, even melting, in the material. According to the constitutive equation, the temperature calculated inside a shear band can be rose to the melting point of the material, which explains the melt-related microstructure observed inside shear bands simply. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

GPI zones were the dominant phase in the alloy upon ageing at 120 °C for 60 min. The metastable η′ phase begins to precipitate in the alloy after being aged at 120 °C for 60 min, and turns to be the main phase after ageing for 300 min. When the alloy was aged at 160 °C, the precipitation was significantly promoted. The results also revealed that the transformation of small GPI zone to η′ phase is the dominant mechanism for η′ formation. Formation and growth of GPI zones and η′ phases led to the increase of the yield strength, while formation and coarsening of η resulted in the decrease of the strength. η′ is responsible for the peak hardening of this alloy. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the yield strength increases with increasing distance from the surface layer to the center layer. More equated grains are observed at the surface than that in the center layer, in which the grain boundaries are almost parallel to the rolling direction.

Because the Taylor factor M of the texture components Brass, S and Copper is higher than that of Cube ND and Random when the tensile direction is aligned to the rolling directions, which results in the higher yield strength near the center layer of the plate.

The results show that more microbands are formed in the center of the plate with the rolling reduction, while the spacing between two bands decreases. The angles between the microbands (MBs) and rolling direction (RD) are 29° and 24°, respectively, from 30 and 43% reductions. The texture analysis shows that the intensity of the rolling texture in the center of the plate, keeps on decreasing rapidly with the reduction, especially the brass (Bs) orientation. The Bs orientation tends to rotate towards the {0 0 1} 〈1 1 0〉 rotated cube orientation with the reduction. When the reduction is up to 43%, a strong new orientation, which deviates about 30° from the ideal position of {0 0 1} 〈1 1 0〉 rotated cube texture, is developed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The flow oscillations in stress at lower strain rates are attributed to the occurrence of cyclic dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The activation energy for superalloy 718 under hot tensile deformation is determined to be 450.2 kJ/mol. The undissolved delta phases play an important role in the elongation behavior.

The different flow behaviors are ascribed to the type of precipitates as well as the dislocation density differences. © 2009 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

77949946845	Effect of fine precipitates on initiation and propagation of micro-cracks in low alloy Cr-Mo-V steel	The effect of fine precipitates on the initiation and propagation of micro-cracks and the length of dislocation-free zone (DFZ) in a low alloy Cr-Mo-V steel was studied by in situ TEM observation for the specimens both in embrttled and toughened conditions. The results show that in the embrittled specimen, dislocations emitted from the crack tip can easily slip by cutting tlirough the precipitates and move away from the crack tip region, so that a long DFZ forms and the brittle fracture occurs via cleavage cracks initiating and propagating. The size of DFZ mainly depends upon the diameter and the interparticle distance of the precipitates in the matrix. In the toughened specimens, the size of DFZ extremely changes with the interparticle distance. Mobile dislocations are emitted from the crack tip and bypassing the particles. The interaction between the dislocations and the particles results in the dislocation pile-up and tangle, leading to diminishing of the DFZ. The crack tip is easy to blunt or chang the propagating direction and the crack propagation shows a jagged path.

The results reveal that proton irradiation has no effect on the long-range structure, but significantly affects the atomic local structure of the NdFeB magnet. The alignment degree of the magnet decreases and the internal stress of the lattice increases after proton irradiation.

MFM results indicate that specimens in a remanent state are single domain and their magnetizations align with the direction of the magnetizing field. The evolution of the magnetic domains with annealing temperatures shows that the thermal demagnetization process consists of four stages.

78349255029	Effect of microstructure on electromagnetic properties of ferromagnetic/dielectric composite particles	The Ferromagnetic/dielectric composite particles are attracting more and more interesting for their potential technology importance in electromagnetic industry [1-3]. To adjusting and control the electromagnetic parameters become a crucial problem to meet various application requirements. In view of materials science, to properly tailor the microstructure of Ferromagnetic/dielectric composite particles would be an effective way to optimal the EM performance. Although the effect of the microstructure on the EM properties has been investigated for some years [1, 4], the results were not intensive and systemic enough to guide the related design or further study. The main obstacle in the investigation is that to find out direct relationships between microstructures and EM properties is rather difficult. EM properties are more or less thought to stand off from microstructures and almost all expressions of permeability or permittivity don't include parameters on materials' microstructure. Fortunately, the dependence of EM properties on static electrical or magnetic properties have been extensively investigated [5-7], and also the influence of microstructures on static magnetic properties and resistivity has been thoroughly studied. Thus to link microstructures and EM properties together by introducing static electrical or magnetic properties as a bridge may be a valid way to promote the investigation of the microstructure-EM properties relationship. © 2010 IEEE.

78651095264	Effects of precipitates on fatigue crack growth rate of AA 7055 aluminum alloy	The effects of precipitates on the fatigue crack growth rate of AA 7055 Al alloy subjected to different ageing treatments were investigated using transmission electron microscope and fatigue crack growth testing. The results show that the T77 treated samples exhibit the lowest crack growth rate, while the crack growth rate of over-aged samples is the highest. In terms of the model based on the reversibility of dislocation motion within the plastic zone close to the crack tip, the improved crack growth resistance is attributed to many precipitates that are coherent with Al matrix in the under-aged and T77 treated samples. When the precipitate is coherent with the Al matrix, the larger the precipitate is, the slower the fatigue crack grows. The effects of grain boundary precipitates and precipitate free zone on the fatigue crack growth resistance are less significant than those of precipitates within grains of the alloy. © 2010 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.

79954493201	Dissolution behavior of δ phase and its effects on deformation mechanism of GH4169 alloy	The evolution of δ phase during hot deformation of GH4169 alloy was investigated by optical microscopy (OM), electron backscattering diffractometry (EBSD), scanning and transmitting electron microscopy. The dissolution processes of δ phase and dynamic mechanisms were analyzed. The effect of δ phase on the mechanism of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was discussed. The results show that, with increasing deformation temperature and decreasing strain rate, the content of δ phase decreases, but the grain size and volume fraction for dynamic recrystallization increase. The plastic deformation is mainly accommodated by bending, kinking and shearing of δ phase. Under the drive force of reduced interface energy, δ phase is transformed from needle to short needle and even sphere. The accelerated dissolution of δ phase can be attributed to the effect of dislocation, vacancy and curvature, which is concerned with the diffusion behavior of solute atoms. A larger amount of high-speed channels for the diffusion of solute atoms form due to the existence of massive defects, such as high density dislocations and vacancies, promoting the dissolution of δ phase. The main nucleation mechanisms of DRX are changed to be δ phase stimulated nucleation and discontinuous nucleation due to δ phase.

79960075190	Crystal plasticity simulation of polycrystalline aluminum and the effect of mesh refinement on mechanical responses	Plastic heterogeneities of polycrystalline aluminum during tensile test have been numerically investigated at grain level. Responses at several length scales are studied, including the overall stress, intergranular and intragranular stress-strain heterogeneities. Special attention is paid to the sensitivity of simulation with respect to the mesh refinement. The results show that, a coarse mesh containing about 500 grains is sufficient to predict the global stress-strain curve, with only one element per grain. About 5 elements per grain is enough to well describe the intergraunlar heterogeneities. However, at least 30 and 60 elements per grain should be used, in order to well describe the average deformation behavior of each grain and to capture most of the intragraunlar heterogeneities, respectively. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

80055012159	Synthesis of Fe-ferrite composite nanotubes with excellent microwave absorption performance	Fe-ferrite composite nanotubes were successfully prepared by thermal hydrogen reduction of α-FeOOH nanowires. The nanotubes have diameters of about 100 nm and lengths of tens of micrometres. The formation mechanism of Fe-ferrite composite nanotubes is discussed, and the non-equilibrium diffusion between hydrogen and oxygen was found to be responsible for the formation of the hollow interior structure. Because of the high shape anisotropy of the 1-D shape, the coercivity of composite nanotubes was higher than that of reported granular Fe-ferrite composite nanoparticles. Since the eddy current is effectively suppressed by the thin wall characteristic of nanotubes, the composite nanotubes exhibit higher permeability than that of the reported ferromagnetic metal nanowires. Due to the better impedance matching and higher dissipation efficiency, a superior microwave absorption performance was obtained in Fe-ferrite composite nanotubes, in which the maximum reflection loss is -18 dB and the effective absorption band (<-10 dB) covers the entire frequency band of 12.5-17.5 GHz. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

84862806778	Microstructures and mechanical properties of age-formed 7050 aluminum alloy	The effects of age-forming on microstructures and mechanical properties of 7050 Al alloy were investigated in this work. The alloy was subjected to age-forming as well as stress-free ageing at 160. °C for 6, 12, 18 and 24. h, and its microstructures were characterized by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was shown that creep might lead to grain elongation during age-forming, and the applied stress induces the coarsening of precipitates in 7050 Al alloy. The texture in the alloy was also influenced by age-forming. Consequently, the differences in microstructures result in differences in mechanical properties of age-forming versus traditional stress-free ageing. The ultimate tensile strength of age-formed samples were slightly lower than that of stress-free aged samples, while the yield strength of age-formed samples were apparently lower than that of stress-free aged samples. Specifically, the elongation of samples age-formed displays apparently decrease. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

0037175038	Deformation and fracture behavior of a RSP Al-Li alloy	The deformation and fracture behaviors in a rapid solidification processed (RSP) Al-Li alloy have been studied by tensile tests, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations. The results show that the interaction mechanism between dislocations and δ' precipitates is shearing in underaged, peak aged and some overaged conditions. In the early stage of deformation (δ < 1%) δ' precipitates are sheared by moving dislocations in one direction, showing that planar slip is predominant. However, in the later stage of deformation (δ > 5%) of the alloy, δ' precipitates are cut into pieces by dislocations from different directions, suggesting that cross slip is predominant. In severely overaged conditions, the deformation is mainly concentrated on the precipitate-free zones (PFZs), and only smaller δ' precipitates near PFZs are sheared. The fine grain size (2-3 μm) produced by rapid solidification cannot change the inherent intergranular fracture mode of Al-Li alloys. TEM observations show that the nominal intergranular fracture in the alloy is actually caused by the cracking of PFZs but not by the fracture of grain boundary. Therefore, it is suggested that in alloys with PFZs in their microstructure, PFZ is the main reason that results in the intergranular fracture, and the width of PFZ is not an important factor in controlling the fracture mode. Tensile tests show that the peak strength of the alloy does not correspond to the transition stage of dislocations' shearing to bypassing of δ' precipitates. The high volume fraction of PFZ and the small spacing of δ' precipitates are thought to be reasons for such a phenomenon. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The fraction of β-phase in PVDF film increases greatly and reaches the peak of 93% after uniaxial stretching. Meanwhile, stretched spherulites and micro-strips paralleling with the stretching direction were observed in the matrix by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of fine structure of fluorine and carbon elements in PVDF, identified by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), indicate that the coordination between F and H atoms of the adjacent chains is produced and thus enhances the dielectric response of the stretched film. As a result, the dielectric constant of the stretched film increases by 50% and achieves up to 12.1, as well as the dielectric loss being as low as 0.02. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84890903331	Stress relaxation behavior of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy in simulated age-forming process	The stress relaxation behavior of age-forming for an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy was studied using a designed device that can simulate the age forming process. The mechanism of stress relaxation was also revealed through calculating thermal activation parameters and analyzing the microstructures. The results suggested that the stress relaxation behavior of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy in the simulated age-forming process can be divided into three stages according to the stress level. The three stages of stress relaxation are: (i) the initial high stress stage, (ii) the subsequent middle stress transition stage and (iii) the last low stress equilibrium stage, respectively. The deformation activation energies are 132 kJ/mol in the initial high stress stage, 119 kJ/mol in the subsequent middle stress transition stage and 91 kJ/mol in the last low stress equilibrium stage, respectively. The analysis of the thermal activation parameters and microstructures revealed that dislocation creep was the dominant deformation mechanism in the initial and subsequent stages of the stress relaxation; whereas diffusion creep is the mechanism in the last stage of the stress relaxation. Additionally, a special threshold stress phenomena was present in the stress relaxation of the age-forming process, which was scribed to the interaction between precipitation and dislocation in the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84896332364	Effect of electron irradiation on electroactive phase and dielectric properties of PVDF films	The effect of electron irradiation on the crystal structure and dielectric properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) films was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were employed to examine the degree of participation in PVDF and the relative fraction of electroactive phase as well as the thermal property of PVDF films. The results showed that both the exothermal peak temperature and the crystallinity of the irradiated film decreased with increasing doses. Huge damage on the morphology of spherulite was observed in irradiated films by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of fine structures in PVDF films characterized by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) implied that the dominance of the oxidation reaction occurred during irradiation, and further induced destruction of the regular packed structure. The results indicate that the β-phase exhibits good anti-irradiation ability during the electron irradiation on PVDF film. Because a large portion of the electroactive phase is maintained and intermediate phases are produced in the irradiated PVDF sample, the irradiated film exhibits a relatively high dielectric constant (around 7.8 under 2200 kGy) with low loss.

84897394218	Ageing behavior and stress corrosion cracking resistance of a non-isothermally aged Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy	A non-isothermal ageing (NIA) process was proposed for an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy aiming to accommodate heating and/or cooling procedures in large components. The precipitation was investigated systematically via TEM observation and DSC analysis. The age-hardening and the conductivity variation were examined to evaluate the potential in the strength and the corrosion resistance, respectively. Double cantilever beams (DCB) experiments were carried out to evaluate the stress corrosion cracking (SCC) resistance. A secondary precipitation occurs during the cooling procedure of the NIA process, which leads to an increase in the precipitates number density and thus induces an extra hardening. The secondary precipitation also contributes to the increase of conductivity of the alloy in the most part of the cooling procedure, but leads to a slight decrease at the terminal stage. The alloy[U+05F3]s resistance to SCC improves persistently as the NIA proceeds. The evolution in microchemistry in grain boundary and adjacent regions is supposed to contribute to the improvement of corrosion resistance. The current study suggests that the NIA process (40. °C→190. °C→100. °C, 20. °C/h) is capable of enduing higher mechanical performances and comparable corrosion resistance to Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys, as compared with that of the T74 condition, which can be technically significant for ageing treatment of large components. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To compare with spherical particles, higher permittivity and permeability was observed by using flaky particles as fillers. High aspect ratios contributed to an enhanced dielectric relaxation in the 1-4 GHz band, resulting in an increased permittivity. The thin thickness together with the high resistivity of Fe-Si flakes was believed to be helpful for suppressing the effect of eddy current and thus lead to an increase in the permeability. The electromagnetic wave absorbing (EMA) performances were observed to be enhanced. With a thin thickness of 2 mm, a wide absorption band with a minimum reflection loss of -12 dB was achieved in 1-4 GHz range, when using 75 wt% of flaky Fe-Si particles as fillers.

84903985580	Effect of age-forming on corrosion properties of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy	A comparative study of the corrosion properties of an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy subjected to simulate age-forming (SAF) and traditional aging was performed. The samples pretreated at 160 °C for 24 h using SAF and traditional aging, were immersed in 3.5 wt% sodium chloride solution for up to 96 h, the process of which was monitored by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Optical profilometry measurement shows that the sample subjected to SAF has deeper pits and larger localized corrosion compared with the traditionally aged sample. EIS results suggest that corrosion rate changes with increasing time of immersion, and age forming makes the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy hard to form effective passive film. The larger precipitate and wider precipitate free zone of the sample subjected to simulate age forming were thought to be responsible for the poor corrosion resistance during the immersion test. Additionally, these results suggest that stress during age-forming increases the grain aspect ratio, which is harmful to intergranular corrosion resistance of the Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84904900159	Effect of surface roughness on breakdown behavior of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy	The surface microstructure and corrosion breakdown behavior of AA7055 Al alloy with different surface roughness were studied using scanning transmission electron microscope and polarization measurements. Atom probe tomography was used to study the compositions of the solid solution matrix of AA7055 alloy in three typical tempers. The matrix Cu content decreased from peak-aged to over-aged tempers, which resulted in a reduction in pitting potential. The AA7055-T77 sample abraded to 320 grit exhibited two breakdown potentials, whereas the 400 grit abraded sample exhibited only one. Surface layer attack occurred for both samples, but was absent for the 1200 grit abraded sample, which exhibited one breakdown potential. Abrasion-induced surface layers containing various microstructural features were observed on all surfaces. Rougher surfaces exhibited thicker surface layers with more Znenriched sub-boundaries and fewer ρ′ precipitates. These changes in surface microstructure with surface roughness resulted in difference in susceptibility of the surface layer, and in the activity gap between the surface layer and underlying bulk matrix, which altered the breakdown behavior of AA7055 alloy. © 2014 The Electrochemical Society.
