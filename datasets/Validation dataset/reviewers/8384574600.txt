17944377127	Heat transfer between liquid and gas in multistage-spraying rotating packed bed	Multistage-spraying rotating packed bed is a novel equipment with low pressure drop, high mass transfer coefficient, small volume, light weight and lower investment, in which rapid and highly efficient reaction can be carried out. It has been used in flue gas desulfurization. When the multistage-spraying rotating packed bed is used in boiler flue gas desulfurization, the cool absorber liquid contacts the hot gas in the spraying area. Gas temperature drops and its humidity increases, while the temperature of absorber liquid increases, during the heat transfer between the hot gas and the cool liquid. The whole process was modeled on the basis of the spray theory and the Lewis Equation. The parameters of the liquid and gas in the spraying area and the outlet could be calculated. The calculated result was verified by the experimental data.

17244377373	Numerical simulation of the heat transfer and flowing resistance performances of concavo-convex tube	A 3-D numerical simulation of the flow and heat transfer process in a concavo-convex tube was carried out by using the Fluent Software. Thus, the velocity and temperature distributions inside the tube were obtained. By the comparison between the simulated results of the concavo-convex tube with those of the smooth tube, it is indicated that the resistance coefficient and the heat transfer coefficient of the concavo-convex tube are much larger than those of the smooth tube, and that, comparing the concavo-convex tube with the smooth tube, the resistance coefficient ratio increases with an increasing Reynolds number, while the heat transfer coefficient ratio decreases. It is also shown that, in the simulation range, when Reynolds number ranges from 2757.76 to 13788.79, the resistance coefficient ratio and the heat transfer coefficient ratio respectively vary from 5.5308 to 8.3663 and from 2.289 to 1.585. The overall evaluation affirms that the integrate property of the concavo-convex tube obviously improves at a lower velocity, which means that the concavo-convex tube is adaptive to the heat transfer enhancement at lower velocity.

0032256045	HTR-10 primary cavity cooling system and its features	The primary cavity cooling system of the 10 MW high temperature gas-cooled test reactor (HTR-10) is one of the important safety related systems of the reactor. It is composed of the residual heat removal system (RHRS) and the shielding cooling system. The passive RHRS removes the residual heat from the reactor core by natural circulation, so it gets rid of the dependence on external power. Finally, the residual heat can be discharged to the atmosphere via air-coolers by natural convection of air. This paper presents the design concept and features of the HTR-10 primary cavity cooling system, namely the passive RHRS with a heat shading board for controlling the radiation heat transfer, cooperating with the active shielding cooling system.

One of the critical factors is controlling scale formation in the heat exchanger and water pipe. In this paper, the water quality of the reclaimed water were analyzed, and the scale formation of the reclaimed water reused as cooling water was investigated. A dynamic simulation device was built in Beijing Thermoelectric Plant. The scale in the heat exchanger was measured by means of SEM, XRD and XRF techniques. The SEM results show that the scale has the crystal morphology. The XRD results show that the scale in brass and stainless steel tube mainly includes calcite and micro quartz. Besides, the scale in stainless steel tube contains magnetite. The XRF analysis shows that the main elements of the scale are oxygen, calcium, carbon, magnesium and so on. In the present paper, the static test had tested the variation of tendency with the temperature increase for kinds of scale. These experimental conclusions will provide a significant basis for decreasing the scale formation and extending applied scope of the reclaimed water in the industrial circulation cooling system.

The test was conducted on a light-duty gasoline engine connected with a multi-coil helical heat exchanger. Combining those experimental and modelling results, it demonstrates that the flow rate of working fluid plays a very important and complex role for controlling the steam outlet pressure and overheat degree. For achieving required overheat and steam pressure, the flow rate must be carefully regulated if the engine working condition changes. The flow rate has also significant influence on the heat exchanger efficiency. To achieving better heat transfer efficiency, the flow rate should be maintained as high as possible. From the simulation, it is found the EER system based on the light-duty test engine could increase the engine fuel conversion efficiency up to 14%, though under general vehicle operating conditions it was just between 3% and 8%. From the test, it is found the installation of heat exchanger can increase the exhaust back pressure slightly, the total fuel saving of the engine could be up to 34% under some operating condition.

0034748392	Application of microfiltration for reuse of backwash water in a conventional water treatment plant - A case study	In conventional drinking water treatment processes, the amount of the filter backwash water covers nearly 3% of the total production. To reduce the water loss and waste discharge in the conventional drinking water treatment process, the Macao Water Supply Co. Ltd (SAAM) plans to recover the backwash water by Microfiltration (MF) membrane process as water resources are scarce and new environmental regulations are mandated in Macao. Generally, the filter backwash water from the conventional water treatment plant with sedimentation process is recycled to the source water to be treated again under certain conditions, and the sedimentation tank discharges most of the sludge. However, it is possible to recycle the backwash water directly to the inlet for direct filtration process due to the limitation of inlet turbidity. This paper describes how to apply MF technology to treat the backwash water of the direct filtration plant and to optimize MF operation. Without pre-treatment of the settling basin for backwash water, the operation of the MF pilot plant is proved to be stable and the permeate quality can meet EU drinking water standards. The pilot study shows that it is both economically and technically feasible to adopt MF technology in backwash water treatment. The main parameters to test MF process include flux, chemical cleaning duration and transmembrane pressure (TMP). They are 150-200 L/m

The results show that adsorption capacity order of three Alter media from high to low is activated carbon, zeolite and ceramisite. Influential factors which affect the adsorption capacity were surveyed. According to the analysis, the first factor is that surface isoelectric point pH of activated carbon is more than 7, but that of zeolite and ceramisite both are less than 7, therefore the activated carbon adsorbs anion phosphate easily. The second factor is related to the micropore in the adsorbent, the micropore size of activated carbon is less than 5nm, and that of zeolite is much less than that of activated carbon, meanwhile that of ceramisite is large. Micropore character is one important factor that phosphorus removal rate is much higher by activated carbon than by zeolite and ceramisite.

Total bacterial count was measured after 24 hours. Results showed the sequence of growing rate priority was as follows, river water, particulate phosphorus water, soluble reactive phosphorus water, poly-phosphorus and potable water with the same phosphorus concentration. Since the growth condition of bacteria correlates with the nutrient of phosphorus in water, total bacterial count represents the growth potential of microorganism in the water under various forms of phosphorus condition.

The special design features of nuclear heating reactor will ensure that any radiological contamination can be excluded from fresh water. As joining thermal process and membrane process seawater desalination, the step utilization of thermal energy and reuse of waste heat can be realized. Copyright © 2010 by ASME.

80053233542	RETRACTED ARTICLE: Case study: Rainwater utilization and water saving design of a village	As one efficient way to address water scarcity problem for some area in the world, the utilization of nontraditional water resources do both alleviate the ecological deterioration and exploit new water resources as well as meet rising water demand. A case was introduced in which rainwater was utilized in Maquanying village, which is far from urban of Beijing. Agricultural water use account for the majority of entire water consumption in Maquanying village, and most of them is derived from ground water wells. Therefore, excessive extract causes the problem of imbalance of water cycle and bad local ecological environment. The rainwater as the alternate could replace part of tap water used for agricultural irrigation and water landscape, with reducing the extraction from groundwater, moreover, this strategy maintains the stability of geological ecology and benefits village's socio-economic sustainable development. As well, the economic benefit is remarkable for Maquanying village residents. This project will play a positive role of demonstration for other villages in using rainwater, especially for villages where the water resources can not meet the mounting water demand. This paper also states other water saving planning and technological strategies for Maquanying village, such as using water efficient fixtures in kitchen and toilets of residents, using rooftop rainwater in courtyard for greening belt sprinkling etc. In sum, the rainwater amount used and collected from Cunbei wood area of Maquanying village approaches 6249m

80054819374	Analyses on control of water demand in an urban independent lake	Park lake water in urban is playing an important role in urban environment and residents' life. The research was aimed at a park lake located in the north of China. As an independent lake, without natural water to supplement, the lake water was evaporated to the air and osmosis to the groundwater rapidly. So, we need to know how much to be supplemented to keep the sightseeing effects. The test shows that water level of the lake goes down with the temperature, humidity, wind power, bottom structure of the lake. Water loss in spring and autumn are faster than that in summer, and the calculation shows that 6.9-104m3 was needed to supplement into the lake in order to keep the water level in a region, and that the supplementary will be 93% times of the water volume. © 2011 IEEE.

84863354390	Permeation efficiency of Pd-Ag membrane modules with porous stainless steel substrates	It is generally regarded that the permeation of hydrogen through palladium or palladium alloy membranes follows the "solution-diffusion" mechanism, which can be described by Sieverts' Law. The hydrogen permeability of actual membrane modules usually differ from those predicted from Sieverts' Law due to the influence of substrate and some other factors. An efficiency (or efficiency factor) has been introduced by many researchers to denote the difference between the actual permeability and those predicted from Sieverts' Law. Extensive experiments were carried out in an electrically heated vessel to study the hydrogen permeation flux and permeation efficiency of Pd-Ag membrane modules with porous stainless steel substrates. The influence of operation conditions on the membrane permeation flux and efficiency was examined. It was observed that the hydrogen permeation flux through the module increased by increasing the temperature and hydrogen pressure in the vessel, while the permeation efficiency increased by increasing the hydrogen pressure in the vessel side and decreasing the membrane temperature. The permeation efficiency was correlated to the vessel temperature (T) and hydrogen pressure difference (P

84868307707	The estimation and application of the water footprint in industrial processes	Large-scale industrial production consumes considerable amounts of water and discharges a large quantity of industrial sewage, and both of these are primary causes of the global water crisis and problems relating to the water environment. Scientifically and effectively evaluating the impact of industrial production on water resources is the premise and foundation of improving the efficiency of water resources utilization and management in industrial production, which is very important in relieving the stress on water resources and the water environment, especially in China. In order to develop a system and methods for evaluating the impact of industrial production on water resources based on the concept and theory of water footprint, the concept of Industrial Water Footprint (IWF) was proposed and its system boundary and evaluation content analysed. IWF is a multi-dimensional index for the increment of water resources usage caused by the industrial production process. As a part of water footprint sustainability evaluation, IWF focuses on the industrial production process. The function of IWF is to evaluate the synthetic impacts of an industrial production process or an individual product, an industrial enterprise, an industry or even a region on water resources and the water environment. Based on the concept of IWF, this paper also analysed its connotation and categories, and determined the system boundary. Compared with the traditional footprint evaluation of entire Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), IWF has its own system boundary and range of issues to be evaluated, in which items such as water usage and pollutant discharge of natural and agricultural process, plant growth, livestock feeds, agricultural irrigation and daily life of human beings are not taken into account. IWF can be divided into two parts: direct and indirect. As the name implies, the direct IWF comprises the water resources consumed and the pollution of the water environment directly caused by the industrial production process. On the other hand, the indirect IWF comprises the potential water resources consumption and pollution of the water environment caused by raw materials, auxiliary materials and secondary energy resources. Moreover, the framework and basic methods of evaluation in IWF are also constructed. The evaluation framework of IWF is composed of three parts: production water footprint, public water footprint and transport water footprint. 'Production water footprint' refers to the sum of processed water footprints of all industrial production processes. 'Public water footprint' refers to the sum of water footprints of the assistant production management system, including detection, maintenance and wastewater treatment. 'Transport water footprint' refers to the water footprint caused by transportation, which includes transportation production and public transportation in industrial production processes. 'Transportation production' particularly refers to freight transportation of all processes, including the semi-finished product and raw material transportation in the industrial production processes, as well as transporting the semi-finished product and final product in and out of store. 'Public transportation' particularly refers to the transportation of the staff of the assistant production management sector. Furthermore, the prospect of application and significance of evaluation of IWF in terms of product, enterprise and region were forecasted and discussed.

84875336722	Comparison of microbiologically induced corrosion on metals in industrial recycling cooling system makeup by municipal reclaimed water	Compared with surface water, there are more organics, nitrogen, phosphorus and microorganisms in municipal reclaimed water, It is necessary to research microbiologically induced corrosion(MIC)in industrial recycling cooling water system makeup by municipal reclaimed water.For recycling cooling water system makeup by municipal reclaimed water, MIC of stainless steel, brass and carbon steel in the sterile and non-sterile real water is studied and compared by electrochemical method, corrosion coupons experiment and scanning electron microscope. The main parameters are fitting resistance(solution resistance, biofilm resistance and polarization resistance), corrosion potential, corrosion current and corrosion rate. The results show that the corrosions of three metals are all exacerbated in nonsterile water, with the MIC of stainless steel the most serious and that of brass the least serious. The impacts of microorganism on the corrosion behavior of stainless steel, brass and carbon steel are significantly different. Microorganism has no influence on the variation of corrosion behavior of stainless steel and carbon steel with time, but its impact on brass corrosion behavior is significant.

84920442842	Full-scale field tests on hoop strains of buried HDPE pipes during construction	Field test data show that the installation of HDPE pipes results in considerable additional strain and stress on the pipes. However, it has not been well addressed in previous studies. In this study, the 0.6 m-diameter HDPE pipes are used in the field tests to investigate the relationship among the hoop strains, vertical and horizontal deflections and thickness of soil cover. It is found that the hoop strains generated in the construction phase (i. e., installation of HDPE pipes) have a good linear relationship with the deflection and the thickness of soil cover. This finding is then validated by a series of finite element numerical simulations. Based on the FE analysis, an empirical relationship is proposed to predict the hoop strains on the HDPE pipes generated in the construction phase. The availability of the proposed method is validated by comparing the predicted values with the field measured ones reported in the previous studies. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has merits of satisfactory accuracy and easy use.

84921812281	In vitro activities of rifampin, colistin, sulbactam and tigecycline tested alone and in combination against extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii	The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro activities of rifampin, colistin, sulbactam and tigecycline alone and in combination against extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (XDR-Ab). Twenty-five XDR-Ab strains were isolated from patients. Broth microdilution assay was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for rifampin, colistin, sulbactam and tigecycline against XDR-Ab strains. The checkerboard microdilution method was used to determine the in vitro activities of potential therapeutic combinations of these four antimicrobial agents. Accordingly, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) and FIC index (FICI) were calculated for each of the combinations. According to our results, when tested as single drugs, rifampin, colistin or tigecycline had good bacteriostatic activity against XDR-Ab, whereas sulbactam was not as active against XDR-Ab isolates. On the other hand, when tested in combination, the combinations of colistin/rifampin, rifampin/sulbactam, rifampin/tigecycline and sulbactam/tigecycline showed good in vitro activities against XDR-Ab isolates. More importantly, these combination regimens could exert addictive or partially synergistic effects at the sub-MIC levels against XDR-Ab strains. Compared with single drugs, most of the combinations of these antimicrobial agents could exert partially synergistic and/or addictive effects, which might provide a better alternative when treating XDR-Ab infections.
