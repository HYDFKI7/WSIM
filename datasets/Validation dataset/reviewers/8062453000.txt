The observed dimuon invariant mass distribution is consistent with the Standard Model background-only hypothesis in the 120-150GeV search range. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5GeV, the observed (expected) upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 7.0 (7.2) times the Standard Model expectation.

84929403808	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections for Higgs boson production in the diphoton decay channel at √s = 8 TeV with ATLAS	Measurements of fiducial and differential cross sections are presented for Higgs boson production in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 8TeV. The analysis is performed in the H → γγ decay channel using 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The signal is extracted using a fit to the diphoton invariant mass spectrum assuming that the width of the resonance is much smaller than the experimental resolution. The signal yields are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution. The pp → H → γγ fiducial cross section is measured to be 43.2 ±9.4 (stat.) <sup>+3.2</sup><inf>−2.9</inf> (syst.) ±1.2 (lumi) fb for a Higgs boson of mass 125.4 GeV decaying to two isolated photons that have transverse momentum greater than 35% and 25% of the diphoton invariant mass and each with absolute pseudorapidity less than 2.37. Four additional fiducial cross sections and two cross-section limits are presented in phase space regions that test the theoretical modelling of different Higgs boson production mechanisms, or are sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. Differential cross sections are also presented, as a function of variables related to the diphoton kinematics and the jet activity produced in the Higgs boson events. The observed spectra are statistically limited but broadly in line with the theoretical expectations.

84938558391	Search for long-lived, heavy particles in final states with a muon and multi-track displaced vertex in proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV with the ATLAS detector	Many extensions of the Standard Model posit the existence of heavy particles with long lifetimes. In this Letter, results are presented of a search for events containing one or more such particles, which decay at a significant distance from their production point, using a final state containing charged hadrons and an associated muon. This analysis uses a data sample of proton-proton collisions at √s=7TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.4 fb<sup>-1</sup> collected in 2011 by the ATLAS detector operating at the Large Hadron Collider. Results are interpreted in the context of R-parity violating supersymmetric scenarios. No events in the signal region are observed and limits are set on the production cross section for pair production of supersymmetric particles, multiplied by the square of the branching fraction for a neutralino to decay to charged hadrons and a muon, based on the scenario where both of the produced supersymmetric particles give rise to neutralinos that decay in this way. However, since the search strategy is based on triggering on and reconstructing the decay products of individual long-lived particles, irrespective of the rest of the event, these limits can easily be reinterpreted in scenarios with different numbers of long-lived particles per event. The limits are presented as a function of neutralino lifetime, and for a range of squark and neutralino masses. © 2013 CERN.

The analysis uses data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.12fb<sup>-1</sup> of s=7TeV proton-proton collisions. The diphoton invariant mass (m<inf>γγ</inf>) spectrum is observed to be in good agreement with the expected Standard Model background. In the large extra dimension scenario of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali, the results provide 95% CL lower limits on the fundamental Planck scale between 2.27 and 3.53 TeV, depending on the number of extra dimensions and the theoretical formalism used.

In the scenario of direct slepton production, if the sleptons decay directly into the lightest neutralino, left-handed slepton masses between 85 and 195 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level for a 20 GeV neutralino.

In a sample of lead-lead collisions at √sNN=2.76TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 7 μb<sup>-1</sup>, ATLAS has measured jets with a calorimeter system over the pseudorapidity interval |η|<2.1 and over the transverse momentum range 38<p<inf>T</inf><210GeV. Jets were reconstructed using the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm with values for the distance parameter that determines the nominal jet radius of R=0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The centrality dependence of the jet yield is characterized by the jet "central-to-peripheral ratio," R<inf>CP</inf>. Jet production is found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of two in the 10% most central collisions relative to peripheral collisions. R<inf>CP</inf> varies smoothly with centrality as characterized by the number of participating nucleons. The observed suppression is only weakly dependent on jet radius and transverse momentum. These results provide the first direct measurement of inclusive jet suppression in heavy ion collisions and complement previous measurements of dijet transverse energy imbalance at the LHC. © 2013 CERN.

The search is based on 4.7 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collisions at s=7TeV recorded in 2011 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Data are analyzed in the lepton+jets final state, characterized by a high-transverse-momentum isolated electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and at least three jets. The analysis strategy relies on the substantial boost of the W bosons in the t't̄' signal when mt'≳400GeV. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed and the result of the search is interpreted in the context of fourth-generation and vector-like quark models. Under the assumption of a branching ratio BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Wb)=1, a fourth-generation t<sup>'</sup> quark with mass lower than 656GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level. In addition, in light of the recent discovery of a new boson of mass ~126GeV at the LHC, upper limits are derived in the two-dimensional plane of BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Wb) versus BR(t<sup>'</sup>→Ht), where H is the Standard Model Higgs boson, for vector-like quarks of various masses. © 2012 CERN.

84938558485	Search for FCNC single top-quark production at √s=7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A search for the production of single top-quarks via flavour-changing neutral-currents is presented. Data collected with the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of √s=7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.05 fb<sup>-1</sup>, are used. Candidate events with a semileptonic top-quark decay signature are classified as signal- or background-like events by using several kinematic variables as input to a neural network. No signal is observed in the neural network output distribution and a Bayesian upper limit is placed on the production cross-section. The observed upper limit at 95% confidence level on the cross-section multiplied by the t→Wb branching fraction is measured to be σqg→t×B(t→Wb)<3.9 pb. This upper limit is converted using a model-independent approach into upper limits on the coupling strengths κ<inf>ugt</inf>/Λ<6.9{dot operator}10<sup>-3</sup> TeV<sup>-1</sup> and κ<inf>cgt</inf>/Λ<1.6{dot operator}10<sup>-2</sup> TeV<sup>-1</sup>, where Λ is the new physics scale, and on the branching fractions B(t→ug)<5.7{dot operator}10-5 and B(t→cg)<2.7{dot operator}10-4. © 2012 CERN.

The analysis is based on 4.7 fb<sup>-1</sup> of s=7 TeV proton-proton collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector. Observations are consistent with Standard Model expectations in three signal regions that are either depleted or enriched in Z-boson decays.

84938558493	Search for diphoton events with large missing transverse momentum in 7 TeV proton-proton collision data with the ATLAS detector	A search for diphoton events with large missing transverse momentum has been performed using proton-proton collision data at s=7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.8 fb<sup>-1</sup>. No excess of events was observed above the Standard Model prediction and model-dependent 95% confidence level exclusion limits are set. In the context of a generalised model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking with a bino-like lightest neutralino of mass above 50 GeV, gluinos (squarks) below 1.07 TeV (0.87 TeV) are excluded, while a breaking scale Λ below 196 TeV is excluded for a minimal model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. For a specific model with one universal extra dimension, compactification scales 1/R<1.40 TeV are excluded. These limits provide the most stringent tests of these models to date. © 2012 CERN.

Events are selected in the single lepton topology by requiring an electron or muon, large missing transverse momentum and at least three jets. With a data sample of 35 pb<sup>-1</sup>, two different multivariate methods, one of which uses b-quark jet identification while the other does not, use kinematic variables to obtain cross-section measurements of σtt-=187±11(stat.)-17+18(syst.)±6(lumi.)pb and σtt-=173±17(stat.)-16+18(syst.)±6(lumi.)pb respectively.

The Higgs boson mass ranges 112.9-115.5 GeV, 131-238 GeV and 251-466 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level (CL), while the range 124-519 GeV is expected to be excluded in the absence of a signal.

84938558499	Evidence for the associated production of a W boson and a top quark in ATLAS at √s = 7 TeV	This Letter presents evidence for the associated production of a W boson and a top quark using 2.05 fb<sup>-1</sup> of pp collision data at s=7TeV accumulated with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The analysis is based on the selection of the dileptonic final states with events featuring two isolated leptons, electron or muon, with significant transverse missing momentum and at least one jet. An approach based on boosted decision trees has been developed to improve the discrimination of single top-quark Wt events from background. A template fit to the final classifier distributions is performed to determine the cross-section. The result is incompatible with the background-only hypothesis at the 3.3σ level, the expected sensitivity assuming the Standard Model production rate being 3.4σ. The corresponding cross-section is determined and found to be σ<inf>Wt</inf>=16.8±2.9(stat)±4.9(syst)pb, in good agreement with the Standard Model expectation. From this result the CKM matrix element |Vtb|=1.03-0.19+0.16 is derived assuming that the Wt production through |V<inf>ts</inf>| and |V<inf>td</inf>| is small. © 2012 CERN.

Data collected from pp collisions at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 7 TeV during 2011, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb<sup>-1</sup>, were used. A search was performed for top-quark pair-production events, with one top quark decaying through the t → Zq FCNC (q = u, c) channel, and the other through the Standard Model dominant mode t → Wb. Only the decays of the Z boson to charged leptons and leptonic W-boson decays were considered as signal. Consequently, the final-state topology is characterised by the presence of three isolated charged leptons, at least two jets and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. No evidence for an FCNC signal was found. An upper limit on the t → Zq branching ratio of BR(t → Zq) < 0.73% is set at the 95% confidence level. Copyright CERN.

84887484748	Studies of the performance of the ATLAS detector using cosmic-ray muons	Muons from cosmic-ray interactions in the atmosphere provide a high-statistics source of particles that can be used to study the performance and calibration of the AT-LAS detector. Cosmic-ray muons can penetrate to the cavern and deposit energy in all detector subsystems. Such events have played an important role in the commissioning of the detector since the start of the installation phase in 2005 and were particularly important for understanding the detector performance in the time prior to the arrival of the first LHC beams. Global cosmic-ray runs were undertaken in both 2008 and 2009 and these data have been used through to the early phases of collision data-taking as a tool for calibration, alignment and detector monitoring. These large datasets have also been used for detector performance studies, including investigations that rely on the combined performance of different subsystems. This paper presents the results of performance studies related to combined tracking, lepton identification and the reconstruction of jets and missing transverse energy. Results are compared to expectations based on a cosmic-ray event generator and a full simulation of the detector response. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2011.

These measurements are obtained using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.5 fb<sup>−1</sup>, recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2011. The data are corrected for detector effects so that cross-sections are presented at the particle level. Cross-sections are measured up to 5TeV dijet mass using jets reconstructed with the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm for values of the jet radius parameter of 0.4 and 0.6. The cross-sections are compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations by NLOJet++ corrected to account for non-perturbative effects. Comparisons with POWHEG predictions, using a next-to-leading-order matrix element calculation interfaced to a partonshower Monte Carlo simulation, are also shown. Electroweak effects are accounted for in both cases. The quantitative comparison of data and theoretical predictions obtained using various parameterizations of the parton distribution functions is performed using a frequentist method. In general, good agreement with data is observed for the NLOJet++ theoretical predictions when using the CT10, NNPDF2.1 and MSTW 2008 PDF sets. Disagreement is observed when using the ABM11 and HERAPDF1.5 PDF sets for some ranges of dijet mass and half the rapidity separation. An example setting a lower limit on the compositeness scale for a model of contact interactions is presented, showing that the unfolded results can be used to constrain contributions to dijet production beyond that predicted by the Standard Model.

In a sample of lead-lead events with a per-nucleon center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV, selected with a minimum bias trigger, jets are reconstructed in fine-grained, longitudinally segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. The transverse energies of dijets in opposite hemispheres are observed to become systematically more unbalanced with increasing event centrality leading to a large number of events which contain highly asymmetric dijets. This is the first observation of an enhancement of events with such large dijet asymmetries, not observed in proton-proton collisions, which may point to an interpretation in terms of strong jet energy loss in a hot, dense medium.© 2010 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

Events were collected using a single-arm minimumbias trigger. The charged-particle multiplicity, its dependence on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity and the relationship between the mean transverse momentum and charged-particle multiplicity are measured. Measurements in different regions of phase space are shown, providing diffraction-reduced measurements as well as more inclusive ones. The observed distributions are corrected to well-defined phase-space regions, using model-independent corrections. The results are compared to each other and to various Monte Carlo (MC) models, including a new AMBT1 pythia6 tune.

The observed distributions of transverse momentum, rapidity, and multiplicity are corrected to hadron level in a model-independent way within well-defined phase-space regions. The distribution of the production ratio of Λ̄ to Λ baryons is also measured. The results are compared with various Monte Carlo simulation models. Although most of these models agree with data to within 15% in the KS0 distributions, substantial disagreements are found in the Λ distributions of transverse momentum. © 2012 CERN.

84863116044	A study of the material in the ATLAS inner detector using secondary hadronic interactions	The ATLAS inner detector is used to reconstruct secondary vertices due to hadronic interactions of primary collision products, so probing the location and amount of material in the inner region of ATLAS. Data collected in 7 TeV pp collisions at the LHC, with a minimum bias trigger, are used for comparisons with simulated events. The reconstructed secondary vertices have spatial resolutions ranging from ∼ 200μm to 1 mm. The overall material description in the simulation is validated to within an experimental uncertainty of about 7%. This will lead to a better understanding of the reconstruction of various objects such as tracks, leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. © 2012 CERN.

Events are selected with a single lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse momentum and at least four jets of which at least one jet is identified as coming from a b-quark. A kinematic fit is used to reconstruct the tt event topology. After background subtraction, a Bayesian unfolding procedure is performed to correct for acceptance and detector effects. The measured value of AC is AC =−0.019±0.028 (stat.)±0.024 (syst.), consistent with the prediction from the MC@NLO Monte Carlo generator of AC = 0.006±0.002.

The tt events are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified b-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, POWHEG, ALPGEN and SHERPA. The experimental uncertainties are often smaller than the spread of theoretical predictions, allowing deviations between data and theory to be observed in some regions of phase space.

Light scalar top quarks are searched for in events with two opposite-sign leptons (e, μ), large missing transverse momentum and at least one jet in the final state. No excess over Standard Model expectations is found, and the results are interpreted under the assumption that the light scalar top decays to a b-quark in addition to an on-shell chargino whose decay occurs through a virtual W boson. If the chargino mass is 106 GeV, light scalar top-quark masses up to 130 GeV are excluded for neutralino masses below 70 GeV.

84873453098	Search for resonances decaying into top-quark pairs using fully hadronic decays in pp collisions with ATLAS at √s=7 TeV	A search for resonances produced in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions and decaying into top-quark pairs is described. In this Letter events where the top-quark decay produces two massive jets with large transverse momenta recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are considered. Two techniques that rely on jet substructure are used to separate top-quark jets from those arising from light quarks and gluons. In addition, each massive jet is required to have evidence of an associated bottom-quark decay. The data are consistent with the Standard Model, and limits can be set on the production cross section times branching fraction of a Z′ boson and a Kaluza-Klein gluon resonance. These limits exclude, at the 95% credibility level, Z′ bosons with masses 0.70-1.00 TeV as well as 1.28-1.32 TeV and Kaluza-Klein gluons with masses 0.70-1.62 TeV. © 2013 Cern for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration.

84876303722	Measurement of the flavour composition of dijet events in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV with the ATLAS detector	This paper describes a measurement of the flavour composition of dijet events produced in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector. The measurement uses the full 2010 data sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 39 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Six possible combinations of light, charm and bottom jets are identified in the dijet events, where the jet flavour is defined by the presence of bottom, charm or solely light flavour hadrons in the jet. Kinematic variables, based on the properties of displaced decay vertices and optimised for jet flavour identification, are used in a multidimensional template fit to measure the fractions of these dijet flavour states as functions of the leading jet transverse momentum in the range 40 GeV to 500 GeV and jet rapidity |y| < 2.1. The fit results agree with the predictions of leading- and next-to-leading-order calculations, with the exception of the dijet fraction composed of bottom and light flavour jets, which is underestimated by all models at large transverse jet momenta. The ability to identify jets containing two b-hadrons, originating from e.g. gluon splitting, is demonstrated. The difference between bottom jet production rates in leading and subleading jets is consistent with the next-to-leading-order predictions.

The search uses a set of variables carrying information on the event kinematics transverse and parallel to the beam line that are sensitive to several topologies expected in supersymmetry. Mutually exclusive final states are defined, allowing a combination of all channels to increase the search sensitivity. No deviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95 % confidence level on visible cross-sections for the production of new particles are extracted.

84876441033	Jet energy measurement with the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at √s =7 TeV	The jet energy scale and its systematic uncertainty are determined for jets measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of √ s = 7 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 38 pb<sup>−1</sup>. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm with distance parameters R = 0.4 or R = 0.6. Jet energy and angle corrections are determined from Monte Carlo simulations to calibrate jets with transverse momenta pT ≥ 20 GeV and pseudorapidities |η| < 4.5. The jet energy systematic uncertainty is estimated using the single isolated hadron response measured in situ and in test-beams, exploiting the transverse momentum balance between central and forward jets in events with dijet topologies and studying systematic variations in Monte Carlo simulations. The jet energy uncertainty is less than 2.5 % in the central calorimeter region (|η| < 0.8) for jets with 60 ≤ pT < 800 GeV, and is maximally 14 % for pT < 30 GeV in the most forward region 3.2 ≤ |η| < 4.5. The jet energy is validated for jet transverse momenta up to 1 TeV to the level of a few percent using several in situ techniques by comparing a well-known reference such as the recoiling photon pT, the sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated to the jet, or a system of low-pT jets recoiling against a high-pT jet. More sophisticated jet calibration schemes are presented based on calorimeter cell energy density weighting or hadronic properties of jets, aiming for an improved jet energy resolution and a reduced flavour dependence of the jet response. The systematic uncertainty of the jet energy determined from a combination of in situ techniques is consistent with the one derived from single hadron response measurements over a wide kinematic range. The nominal corrections and uncertainties are derived for isolated jets in an inclusive sample of high-pT jets. Special cases such as event topologies with close-by jets, or selections of samples with an enhanced content of jets originating from light quarks, heavy quarks or gluons are also discussed and the corresponding uncertainties are determined.

Limits are set on the cross-section in a fiducial region for new sources of same-sign high-mass dilepton events in the ee, eμ and μμ channels. Four models predicting same-sign dilepton signals are constrained: two descriptions of Majorana neutrinos, a cascade topology similar to supersymmetry or universal extra dimensions, and fourth generation d-type quarks. Assuming a new physics scale of 1 TeV, Majorana neutrinos produced by an effective operator V with masses below 460 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. A lower limit of 290 GeV is set at 95% confidence level on the mass of fourth generation d-type quarks. Copyright CERN.

84884306084	Luminosity determination in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector at the LHC	Measurements of luminosity obtained using the ATLAS detector during early running of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at √s = 7 TeV are presented. The luminosity is independently determined using several detectors and multiple algorithms, each having different acceptances, systematic uncertainties and sensitivity to background. The ratios of the luminosities obtained from these methods are monitored as a function of time and of μ, the average number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. Residual time- and μ-dependence between the methods is less than 2% for 0 < μ < 2.5. Absolute luminosity calibrations, performed using beam separation scans, have a common systematic uncertainty of ±11%, dominated by the measurement of the LHC beam currents. After calibration, the luminosities obtained from the different methods differ by at most ±2%. The visible cross sections measured using the beam scans are compared to predictions obtained with the PYTHIA and PHOJET event generators and the ATLAS detector simulation. © CERN for the benefit of the ATLAS collaboration 2011.

84883789816	Measurement of the inclusive jet cross-section in pp collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV and comparison to the inclusive jet cross-section at √s = 7 TeV using the ATLAS detector	The inclusive jet cross-section has been measured in proton–proton collisions at √s = 2.76 TeV in a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.20 pb<sup>−1</sup> collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2011. Jets are identified using the anti-k<inf>t</inf> algorithm with two radius parameters of 0.4 and 0.6. The inclusive jet double-differential cross-section is presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum p<inf>T</inf> and jet rapidity y, covering a range of 20 ≤ p<inf>T</inf> < 430 GeV and |y| < 4.4. The ratio of the cross-section to the inclusive jet cross-section measurement at √s = 7 TeV, published by the ATLAS Collaboration, is calculated as a function of both transverse momentum and the dimensionless quantity x<inf>T</inf> = 2p<inf>T/</inf> √s, in bins of jet rapidity. The systematic uncertainties on the ratios are significantly reduced due to the cancellation of correlated uncertainties in the two measurements. Results are compared to the prediction from next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations corrected for non-perturbative effects, and next-to-leading order Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, the ATLAS jet cross-section measurements at √s = 2.76 TeV and √s = 7 TeV are analysed within a framework of next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations to determine parton distribution functions of the proton, taking into account the correlations between the measurements.

84884538781	Performance of jet substructure techniques for large-R jets in proton-proton collisions at √s=7 TeV using the ATLAS detector	This paper presents the application of a variety of techniques to study jet substructure. The performance of various modified jet algorithms, or jet grooming techniques, for several jet types and event topologies is investigated for jets with transverse momentum larger than 300 GeV. Properties of jets subjected to the mass-drop filtering, trimming, and pruning algorithms are found to have a reduced sensitivity to multiple proton-proton interactions, are more stable at high luminosity and improve the physics potential of searches for heavy boosted objects. Studies of the expected discrimination power of jet mass and jet substructure observables in searches for new physics are also presented. Event samples enriched in boosted W and Z bosons and top-quark pairs are used to study both the individual jet invariant mass scales and the efficacy of algorithms to tag boosted hadronic objects. The analyses presented use the full 2011 ATLAS dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.7 ± 0.1 fb

84889924283	Measurement of inclusive two-particle angular correlations in pp collisions with the atlas detector at the LHC	We present a measurement of two-particle angular correlations in protonproton collisions at √a = 900 GeV and 7TeV. The collision events were collected during 2009 and 2010 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using a single-arm minimum bias trigger. Correlations are measured for charged particles produced in the kinematic range of transverse momentum pT > 100MeV and pseudorapidity |n| < 2.5. A complex structure in pseudorapidity and azimuth is observed at both collision energies. Results are compared to pythia 8 and herwig++ as well as to the AMBT2B, DW and Perugia 2011 tunes of pythia 6. The data are not satisfactorily described by any of these models.

For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125.5 GeV, the observed upper limit at the 95% confidence level is 11 times the Standard Model expectation.

84899561004	Study of heavy-flavor quarks produced in association with top-quark pairs at s =7TeV using the ATLAS detector	Using a sample of dilepton top-quark pair (tt̄) candidate events, a study is performed of the production of top-quark pairs together with heavy-flavor (HF) quarks, the sum of tt̄+b+X and tt̄+c+X, collectively referred to as tt̄+HF. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.7fb-1 of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The presence of additional HF (b or c) quarks in the tt̄ sample is inferred by looking for events with at least three b-tagged jets, where two are attributed to the b quarks from the tt̄ decays and the third to additional HF production. The dominant background to tt̄+HF in this sample is tt̄+jet events in which a light-flavor jet is misidentified as a heavy-flavor jet. To determine the heavy- and light-flavor content of the additional b-tagged jets, a fit to the vertex mass distribution of b-tagged jets in the sample is performed. The result of the fit shows that 79±14(stat)±22(syst) of the 105 selected extra b-tagged jets originate from HF quarks, 3 standard deviations away from the hypothesis of zero tt̄+HF production. The result for extra HF production is quoted as a ratio (RHF) of the cross section for tt̄+HF production to the cross section for tt̄ production with at least one additional jet. Both cross sections are measured in a fiducial kinematic region within the ATLAS acceptance. RHF is measured to be [6.2±1.1(stat)±1.8(syst)]% for jets with pT>25GeV and |η|<2.5, in agreement with the expectations from Monte Carlo generators. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84901405418	Search for invisible decays of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson in ATLAS	A search for evidence of invisible-particle decay modes of a Higgs boson produced in association with a Z boson at the Large Hadron Collider is presented. No deviation from the standard model expectation is observed in 4.5 fb<sup>-1</sup> (20.3 fb<sup>-1</sup>) of 7 (8) TeV pp collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Assuming the standard model rate for ZH production, an upper limit of 75%, at the 95% confidence level is set on the branching ratio to invisible-particle decay modes of the Higgs boson at a mass of 125.5 GeV. The limit on the branching ratio is also interpreted in terms of an upper limit on the allowed dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section within a Higgs-portal dark matter scenario. Within the constraints of such a scenario, the results presented in this Letter provide the strongest available limits for low-mass dark matter candidates. Limits are also set on an additional neutral Higgs boson, in the mass range 110 <mH <400 GeV, produced in association with a Z boson and decaying to invisible particles.

84907497537	Measurement of event-plane correlations in s NN =2.76 TeV lead-lead collisions with the ATLAS detector	A measurement of event-plane correlations involving two or three event planes of different order is presented as a function of centrality for 7 μb-1 Pb+Pb collision data at sNN=2.76 TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Fourteen correlators are measured using a standard event-plane method and a scalar-product method, and the latter method is found to give a systematically larger correlation signal. Several different trends in the centrality dependence of these correlators are observed. These trends are not reproduced by predictions based on the Glauber model, which includes only the correlations from the collision geometry in the initial state. Calculations that include the final-state collective dynamics are able to describe qualitatively, and in some cases also quantitatively, the centrality dependence of the measured correlators. These observations suggest that both the fluctuations in the initial geometry and the nonlinear mixing between different harmonics in the final state are important for creating these correlations in momentum space. © 2014 CERN, for the ATLAS Collaboration.

84907502729	Search for pair-produced third-generation squarks decaying via charm quarks or in compressed supersymmetric scenarios in pp collisions at √s =8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Results of a search for supersymmetry via direct production of third-generation squarks are reported, using 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at s=8TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. Two different analysis strategies based on monojetlike and c-tagged event selections are carried out to optimize the sensitivity for direct top squark-pair production in the decay channel to a charm quark and the lightest neutralino (t∼1→c+χ∼10) across the top squark-neutralino mass parameter space. No excess above the Standard Model background expectation is observed. The results are interpreted in the context of direct pair production of top squarks and presented in terms of exclusion limits in the (mt∼1, mχ∼10) parameter space. A top squark of mass up to about 240 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level for arbitrary neutralino masses, within the kinematic boundaries. Top squark masses up to 270 GeV are excluded for a neutralino mass of 200 GeV. In a scenario where the top squark and the lightest neutralino are nearly degenerate in mass, top squark masses up to 260 GeV are excluded. The results from the monojetlike analysis are also interpreted in terms of compressed scenarios for top squark-pair production in the decay channel t∼1→b+ff′+χ∼10 and sbottom pair production with b∼1→b+χ∼10, leading to a similar exclusion for nearly mass-degenerate third-generation squarks and the lightest neutralino. The results in this paper significantly extend previous results at colliders.

84907683450	A neural network clustering algorithm for the ATLAS silicon pixel detector	A novel technique to identify and split clusters created by multiple charged particles in the ATLAS pixel detector using a set of artificial neural networks is presented. Such merged clusters are a common feature of tracks originating from highly energetic objects, such as jets. Neural networks are trained using Monte Carlo samples produced with a detailed detector simulation. This technique replaces the former clustering approach based on a connected component analysis and charge interpolation. The performance of the neural network splitting technique is quantified using data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC collected by the ATLAS detector in 2011 and from Monte Carlo simulations. This technique reduces the number of clusters shared between tracks in highly energetic jets by up to a factor of three. It also provides more precise position and error estimates of the clusters in both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution.

Charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) and densities of all-particle (Formula presented.) and charged-particle multiplicity and (Formula presented.) have been measured in regions azimuthally transverse to the hardest jet in each event. These are presented both as one-dimensional distributions and with their mean values as functions of the leading-jet transverse momentum from 20 to 800 (Formula presented.). The correlation of charged-particle mean (Formula presented.) with charged-particle multiplicity is also studied, and the (Formula presented.) densities include the forward rapidity region; these features provide extra data constraints for Monte Carlo modelling of colour reconnection and beam-remnant effects respectively. For the first time, underlying event observables have been computed separately for inclusive jet and exclusive dijet event selections, allowing more detailed study of the interplay of multiple partonic scattering and QCD radiation contributions to the underlying event. Comparisons to the predictions of different Monte Carlo models show a need for further model tuning, but the standard approach is found to generally reproduce the features of the underlying event in both types of event selection.

Significant long-range "ridgelike" correlations are observed for pairs with small (|Δϕ|<π/3) and back-to-back pairs (|Δφ|>2π/3) over the transverse momentum range 0.4<p<inf>T</inf><12 GeV and in different intervals of event activity. The event activity is defined by either the number of reconstructed tracks or the total transverse energy on the Pb-fragmentation side. The azimuthal structure of such long-range correlations is Fourier decomposed to obtain the harmonics ν<inf>n</inf> as a function of pT and event activity. The extracted ν<inf>n</inf> values for n=2 to 5 decrease with n. The ν<inf>2</inf> and ν<inf>3</inf> values are found to be positive in the measured pT range. The ν<inf>1</inf> is also measured as a function of pT and is observed to change sign around pT≈1.5-2.0 GeV and then increase to about 0.1 for pT>4 GeV. The ν<inf>2</inf> (pT), ν<inf>3</inf> (pT), and ν<inf>4</inf> (pT) are compared to the ν<inf>n</inf> coefficients in Pb+Pb collisions at √sNN=2.76 TeV with similar event multiplicities.

84914140238	Search for long-lived neutral particles decaying into lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at √s= 8TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict neutral particles that decay into final states consisting of collimated jets of light leptons and hadrons (so-called “lepton jets”). These particles can also be long-lived with decay length comparable to, or even larger than, the LHC detectors’ linear dimensions. This paper presents the results of a search for lepton jets in proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy of √s= 8TeV in a sample of 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> collected during 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Limits on models predicting Higgs boson decays to neutral long-lived lepton jets are derived as a function of the particle’s proper decay length.

84914179451	Search for top squark pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum in (Formula presented.)= 8 TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	The results of a search for top squark (stop) pair production in final states with one isolated lepton, jets, and missing transverse momentum are reported. The analysis is performed with proton-proton collision data at (Formula presented.) = 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb<sup>−1</sup>. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is taken to be the lightest neutralino which only interacts weakly and is assumed to be stable. The stop decay modes considered are those to a top quark and the LSP as well as to a bottom quark and the lightest chargino, where the chargino decays to the LSP by emitting a W boson. A wide range of scenarios with different mass splittings between the stop, the lightest neutralino and the lightest chargino are considered, including cases where the W bosons or the top quarks are off-shell. Decay modes involving the heavier charginos and neutralinos are addressed using a set of phenomenological models of supersymmetry. No significant excess over the Standard Model prediction is observed. A stop with a mass between 210 and 640 GeV decaying directly to a top quark and a massless LSP is excluded at 95% confidence level, and in models where the mass of the lightest chargino is twice that of the LSP, stops are excluded at 95% confidence level up to a mass of 500 GeV for an LSP mass in the range of 100 to 150 GeV. Stringent exclusion limits are also derived for all other stop decay modes considered, and model-independent upper limits are set on the visible cross-section for processes beyond the Standard Model.

84919372915	Comprehensive measurements of t -channel single top-quark production cross sections at s =7TeV with the ATLAS detector	This article presents measurements of the t-channel single top-quark (t) and top-antiquark (t¯) total production cross sections σ(tq) and σ(t¯q), their ratio Rt=σ(tq)/σ(t¯q), and a measurement of the inclusive production cross section σ(tq+t¯q) in proton-proton collisions at s=7TeV at the LHC. Differential cross sections for the tq and t¯q processes are measured as a function of the transverse momentum and the absolute value of the rapidity of t and t¯, respectively. The analyzed data set was recorded with the ATLAS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.59fb-1. Selected events contain one charged lepton, large missing transverse momentum, and two or three jets. The cross sections are measured by performing a binned maximum-likelihood fit to the output distributions of neural networks. The resulting measurements are σ(tq)=46±1(stat)±6(syst)pb, σ(t¯q)=23±1(stat)±3(syst)pb, Rt=2.04±0.13(stat)±0.12(syst), and σ(tq+t¯q)=68±2(stat)±8(syst)pb, consistent with the Standard Model expectation. The uncertainty on the measured cross sections is dominated by systematic uncertainties, while the uncertainty on Rt is mainly statistical. Using the ratio of σ(tq+t¯q) to its theoretical prediction, and assuming that the top-quark-related CKM matrix elements obey the relation |Vtb|蠑|Vts|,|Vtd|, we determine |Vtb|=1.02±0.07.

84919401685	Search for nonpointing and delayed photons in the diphoton and missing transverse momentum final state in 8 TeV pp collisions at the LHC using the ATLAS detector search for nonpointing and delayed photons in ... G. Aad et al.	A search has been performed, using the full 20.3fb-1 data sample of 8 TeV proton-proton collisions collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, for photons originating from a displaced vertex due to the decay of a neutral long-lived particle into a photon and an invisible particle. The analysis investigates the diphoton plus missing transverse momentum final state, and is therefore most sensitive to pair production of long-lived particles. The analysis technique exploits the capabilities of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter to make precise measurements of the flight direction, as well as the time of flight, of photons. No excess is observed over the Standard Model predictions for background. Exclusion limits are set within the context of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models, with the lightest neutralino being the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle and decaying into a photon and gravitino with a lifetime in the range from 250 ps to about 100 ns.

84919947960	Measurements of spin correlation in top-antitop quark events from proton-proton collisions at s =7TeV using the ATLAS detector	Measurements of spin correlation in top quark pair production are presented using data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC with proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6fb-1. Events are selected in final states with two charged leptons and at least two jets and in final states with one charged lepton and at least four jets. Four different observables sensitive to different properties of the top quark pair production mechanism are used to extract the correlation between the top and antitop quark spins. Some of these observables are measured for the first time. The measurements are in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction at next-to-leading-order accuracy.

84920080864	Search for contact interactions and large extra dimensions in the dilepton channel using proton–proton collisions at √s=8 TeV with the ATLAS detector	A search is conducted for non-resonant new phenomena in dielectron and dimuon final states, originating from either contact interactions or large extra spatial dimensions. The LHC 2012 proton–proton collision dataset recorded by the ATLAS detector is used, corresponding to 20 fb(Formula presented.) (Formula presented.) at (Formula presented.)

84920099129	A measurement of the ratio of the production cross sections for W and Z bosons in association with jets with the ATLAS detector	The ratio of the production cross sections for W and Z bosons in association with jets has been measured in proton–proton collisions at√s = TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement is based on the entire 2011 dataset, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of4.6fb-1.

84920136557	Measurement of the muon reconstruction performance of the ATLAS detector using 2011 and 2012 LHC proton–proton collision data	This paper presents the performance of the ATLAS muon reconstruction during the LHC run with pp collisions at √s=7–8 TeV in 2011–2012, focusing mainly on data collected in 2012. Measurements of the reconstruction efficiency and of the momentum scale and resolution, based on large reference samples of (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.) decays, are presented and compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Corrections to the simulation, to be used in physics analysis, are provided. Over most of the covered phase space (muon (Formula presented.) GeV) the efficiency is above 99% and is measured with per-mille precision. The momentum resolution ranges from 1.7% at central rapidity and for transverse momentum (Formula presented.) GeV, to (Formula presented.) at large rapidity and (Formula presented.) GeV. The momentum scale is known with an uncertainty of 0.05% to 0.2% depending on rapidity. A method for the recovery of final state radiation from the muons is also presented.

The measurement is based on data collected using the ATLAS detector at the LHC in proton–proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1. Distributions of the charged particle multiplicity and of the charged particle transverse momentum are measured in regions of azimuthal angle defined with respect to the Z-boson direction. The measured distributions are compared to similar distributions measured in jet events, and to the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators implementing different underlying event models.

84919880597	Measurement of the (Math presented.) and 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector	The inclusive top quark pair (Formula presented.) pair in the final state. The measurement was performed with the 2011 7 TeV dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 (Formula presented.)-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated systematic uncertainties. The cross-section was measured to be: (Formula presented.)where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics, experimental and theoretical systematic effects, knowledge of the integrated luminosity and of the LHC beam energy. The results are consistent with recent theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order. Fiducial measurements corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the leptons are also reported, together with the ratio of cross-sections measured at the two centre-of-mass energies. The inclusive cross-section results were used to determine the top quark pole mass via the dependence of the theoretically predicted cross-section on (Formula presented.) GeV. By looking for an excess of (Formula presented.) production with respect to the QCD prediction, the results were also used to place limits on the pair-production of supersymmetric top squarks (Formula presented.) with masses close to the top quark mass, decaying via (Formula presented.) to predominantly right-handed top quarks and a light neutralino (Formula presented.), the lightest supersymmetric particle. Top squarks with masses between the top quark mass and 177 GeV are excluded at the 95 % confidence level.

84919918864	Electron and photon energy calibration with the ATLAS detector using LHC Run 1 data	This paper presents the electron and photon energy calibration achieved with the ATLAS detector using about 25 fb-1 of LHC proton–proton collision data taken at centre-of-mass energies of (Equation Present) and 8 TeV. The reconstruction of electron and photon energies is optimised using multivariate algorithms. The response of the calorimeter layers is equalised in data and simulation, and the longitudinal profile of the electromagnetic showers is exploited to estimate the passive material in front of the calorimeter and reoptimise the detector simulation. After all corrections, the Z resonance is used to set the absolute energy scale. For electrons from Z decays, the achieved calibration is typically accurate to 0.05 % in most of the detector acceptance, rising to 0.2 % in regions with large amounts of passive material. The remaining inaccuracy is less than 0.2–1 % for electrons with a transverse energy of 10 GeV, and is on average 0.3 % for photons. The detector resolution is determined with a relative inaccuracy of less than 10 % for electrons and photons up to 60 GeV transverse energy, rising to 40 % for transverse energies above 500 GeV.

84924040652	Search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons in s =8TeV pp collisions with the ATLAS detector	Results from a search for supersymmetry in events with four or more leptons including electrons, muons and taus are presented. The analysis uses a data sample corresponding to 20.3fb-1 of proton-proton collisions delivered by the Large Hadron Collider at s=8TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector. Signal regions are designed to target supersymmetric scenarios that can be either enriched in or depleted of events involving the production of a Z boson. No significant deviations are observed in data from standard model predictions and results are used to set upper limits on the event yields from processes beyond the standard model. Exclusion limits at the 95% confidence level on the masses of relevant supersymmetric particles are obtained. In R-parity-violating simplified models with decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle to electrons and muons, limits of 1350 and 750 GeV are placed on gluino and chargino masses, respectively. In R-parity-conserving simplified models with heavy neutralinos decaying to a massless lightest supersymmetric particle, heavy neutralino masses up to 620 GeV are excluded. Limits are also placed on other supersymmetric scenarios.

84924420466	Measurement of differential production cross-sections for a Z boson in association with b-jets in 7 TeV proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: Measurements of differential production cross-sections of a Z boson in association with b-jets in pp collisions at √ = 7 TeV are reported. The data analysed correspond to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb<sup>−1</sup> recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Particle-level cross-sections are determined for events with a Z boson decaying into an electron or muon pair, and containing b-jets. For events with at least one b-jet, the cross-section is presented as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity, together with the inclusive b-jet cross-section as a function of b-jet transverse momentum, rapidity and angular separations between the b-jet and the Z boson. For events with at least two b-jets, the cross-section is determined as a function of the invariant mass and angular separation of the two highest transverse momentum b-jets, and as a function of the Z boson transverse momentum and rapidity. Results are compared to leading-order and next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculations.

84925620206	Search for pair and single production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation quark in pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV with the ATLAS detector	Abstract: A search is presented for the production of new heavy quarks that decay to a Z boson and a third-generation Standard Model quark. In the case of a new charge +2/3 quark (T ), the decay targeted is T → Zt, while the decay targeted for a new charge −1/3 quark (B) is B → Zb. The search is performed with a dataset corresponding to 20.3 fb<sup>−1</sup> of pp collisions at (Formula presented.) TeV recorded in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Selected events contain a high transverse momentum Z boson candidate reconstructed from a pair of oppositely charged same-flavor leptons (electrons or muons), and are analyzed in two channels defined by the absence or presence of a third lepton. Hadronic jets, in particular those with properties consistent with the decay of a b-hadron, are also required to be present in selected events. Different requirements are made on the jet activity in the event in order to enhance the sensitivity to either heavy quark pair production mediated by the strong interaction, or single production mediated by the electroweak interaction. No significant excess of events above the Standard Model expectation is observed, and lower limits are derived on the mass of vector-like T and B quarks under various branching ratio hypotheses, as well as upper limits on the magnitude of electroweak coupling parameters.
