20544432945	Ultrasonic characters of entheses and their impact factors in healthy volunteers	Background: Enthesitis is the most important pathologic change and one of the characteristic manifestations of spondyloarthropathy (SpA). However, its clinical manifestations lack specificity, and medical imaging techniques become an important auxiliary means in its diagnosis. Currently, ultrasound has been applied to examine the entheses of patients with SpA abroad, but so far there is no investigation about the ultrasonic manifestations of entheses in healthy volunteers. Objective: To comprehend the acoustic imaging manifestations of entheses in healthy volunteers, and primarily investigate the feasibility of ultrasound in detecting entheses and the possible impact factors of acoustic imaging manifestations. Design: A nonrandomized inter-controlled trail. Setting and participants: A total of 30 young healthy workers and medical students who worked or studied in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University were included in our study, including 22 male and 8 female. None of them suffered from any arthropathies or chronic low back pain. Intervention: High frequency and Color Doppler ultrasound were adopted to detect 540 entheses of 30 healthy volunteers, the entheseal thicknesses were compared respectively according to left and right sides, as well as the gender. X-ray was used to inspect if there were any abnormal findings at the attaching bones. Main outcome measures: The thickness, the echo inside entheses, the entourage, the attaching bone and the entheseal blood flow were detected. Results: In normal entheses, there was a little lower but equal resonance, in which there was clear funicular fibrin resonance but without blood signal. Most entheses had a little higher membrane resonance, which was clearly divided from entourage. The surface of attaching bone was smooth and continuous. The mean thickness of the lower insertion of rectus femoris tendon, the upper insertion of patellar ligament, the lower insertion of patellar ligament, the lower insertion of tibial collateral ligament, the lower insertion of fibular collateral ligament, the insertion of Achilles tendon and plantar aponeurosis in male volunteers were (0.50 ± 0.06), (0.50±0.07), (0.42±0.04), (0.20±0.03), (0.38±0.04), (0.52±0.07) and (0.32 ± 0.03) cm respectively, while the mean thickness of the corresponding insertions in female volunteers were (0.44 ± 0.04), (0.46 ± 0.03), (0.39 ± 0.03), (0.19 ± 0.02), (0.32 ± 0.02), (0.41 ± 0.06) and (0.28 ± 0.03) cm respectively. All entheses except for the lower insertion of tibial collateral ligament were thicker in male than in female(P < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in the thickness between left and right insertions(P > 0.05). Calcification, erosion and hyperplasia of the attaching bone or increasing blood flow were found in 11 entheses of 8 volunteers (2.0% of all the 540 entheses detected). There were 15 items of abnormal signs all together. Some of the abnormal sites had traumatic histories. Conclusion: The thicknesses are almost the same in the corresponding insertions between left and right sides, but the thicknesses of most insertions in male are thicker than those in female. Stature, body mass and exercise might impact on entheseal thickness. Trauma can cause abnormal acoustic imaging manifestations of entheses. Ultrasound is an available approach to detecting etheses.

20544457826	Analysis of entheseal blood flow in patients with spondyloarthropathies by color Doppler	Background: Seronegative spondyloarthropathies(SpA) are a group of diseases involving the spine, peripheral joints and structures around the joints that mostly occur in adult males with high morbidity and disability rate. Presently, it is widely believed that enthesis is the initiated site of SpA so that enthesitis is an important pathologic base and one of the characteristic clinical manifestations of SpA, however, there is no specific clinical manifestation enthesitis. Objective: To compare the difference on entheseal blood flow between health volunteers and patients with SpA and explore the value of color Doppler(CD) in assessing the pathological change of enthesis. Design: Non-randomized case controlled study to patients. Setting: Department of Rheumatology, Department of Ultrasound of a university, Department of Rheumatology of General Hospital of Chinese PLA. Participants: Totally 30 patients with SpA admitted into Third Affilated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University during August 2001 to April 2002 and willing to take CD examination were selected as case group. All of them met the classification criteria of SpA set up by the European SpA Study Group in 1991 with 24 males and 6 females. Thirty healthy workers and students working or studying in the same Hospital were enrolled as volunteers for the control group, none of them had any histories of arthropathy or chronic lower back pain, and there were 22 males and 8 females among them. Interventions: Color Doppler was used to examine the blood flow of 18 entheses in lower limbs of every healthy volunteers and SpA patients and semi-quantitative method was used to classify the blood flow. Main outcome measures: Blood flow of entheses. Results: Among 30 healthy volunteers, 5 cases (16.7%) had been detected blood flow from at least one enthesis. From the 540 entheses being examined, 9 entheses were detected blood flow signals of grade I, the positive rate was 1.7%. While among 30 SpA patients, 24(80 0%) had at least one enthesis being detected for positive blood flow. Eighty-four of totally 540 examined entheses were found for positive blood flow signals with a positive rate of 15.6%, and the number of entheses with grade I, II and III of blood flow were 19, 33 and 32 respectively among the 84 positive entheses. There was significantly different in the positive rate of blood flow and classification of entheses between SpA patients and healthy volunteers by χ

20544473118	Intra-articular injection of hormone for knee arthritis assessed by color Doppler ultrasound	Aim: To investigate the application value of color Doppler ultrasound in assessing the effect of intra-articular injection of hormone for knee arthritis. Methods: Nineteen patients finally diagnosed with knee arthritis were selected from the Department of Rheumatology in the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from July 2003 to February 2004. The swelled knee joint was intra-articularly injected 1 mL Diprospan (betamethasone dipropionate 5 mg and betamethasone sodium 2 mg) assessed before and 1 week after intra-articular injection of steroids. Such indicators as visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain, tenderness of knee joint, the amount of superapatellar fluid, the thickness and the blood signal of the synovial membrane detected by color ultrasound were observed before and 1 week after injection. Results: The VAS score for pain, tenderness, the amount of superapatellar fluid and the blood signal of the synovial membrane in the patients were all decreased significantly after injection as compared that before injection (P = 0. 017, 0. 02, 0. 002, 0. 002, all < 0. 05), while the thickness of synovial membrane did not become thinner significantly after injection (P = 0. 566, > 0. 05). Conclusion: Color Doppler sonography for detecting the amount of superapatellar fluid and the blood signal of the synovial membrane can be used to objectively assess the clinical effect in the treatment of knee arthritis.

22644447569	Comparison of ultrasonography, CT and MRI in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis	AIM: To compare ultrasound (US), CT and MRI in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, and to select the best predictive signs for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis by each technique. METHODS: Imaging findings on US, CT and MRI in 142 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (<3 cm in diameter) were blindly reviewed by three doctors using a severity scoring system. Imaging findings included irregular or nodular liver surface, blunt liver edge, liver parenchyma abnormalities, liver morphological changes and portal hypertension. Results were compared with pathological results on non-tumor resected specimens. RESULTS: Blunt liver edge, liver parenchyma abnormalities, and liver morphological changes were the best predictive signs for US diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Irregular or nodular liver surface, liver parenchyma abnormalities and portal hypertension were the best predictive signs for MRI. Irregular or nodular liver surface, blunt liver edge, liver parenchyma abnormalities and portal hypertension were the best predictive signs for CT. The diagnostic accuracies of liver cirrhosis by MRI, CT and US were 70.3%, 67.0%, 64.0%, the sensitivities were 86.7%, 84.3%, 52.4%, and the specificities were 53.9%, 52.9%, 73.5%, respectively. MRI and CT were slightly superior to US in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis; however, there was no significant difference regarding the diagnostic accuracy among them. CONCLUSION: US, CT and MRI have different predictive signs, different imaging feature and diagnostic superiority. These imaging techniques all play important roles in the evaluation of liver cirrhosis.

27644443793	Role of color Doppler in assessing disease activity of patients with spondyloarthropathies	Background: Spondyloarthropathies(SpA) are a group of interrelated disorders that involve the spine, peripheral joints, and tissues around or outside the joints. SpA are most common in young males, and both the incidence and the mutilation rate are very high. It is important to evaluate the disease activity of patients with SpA since the evaluation can help in therapeutic selection and prognostic prediction of SpA. But up to now there still has not been a widely clinically acceptable criterion to evaluate the disease activity of SpA. Objective: To study the worth of color Doppler(CD) in assessing the disease activity of patients with SpA. Design: Non-random and self-control clinical study based on the patients. Setting: All patients recruited in this study were from department of rheumatology of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. And all the ultrasonic examinations were conducted in the department of ultrasound of the same hospital. Particiapants: Thirty(24 males and 6 females) patients with SpA who met the European SpA Study Group criteria for the classification of SpA issued in 1991 and consented to be examined by CD were included. Methods: CD was used to determine the blood perfusion at 18 major entheses of lower limbs of each patient with a semi-quantitative method. Blood sample was also taken from the patients for the examination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate(ESR) and C reactive protein(CRP). The disease activity of the patients was also evaluated with the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Main outcome measures: To observe the inter-correlations between entheseal blood perfusion, ESR, CRP and BASDAI. Results: 80% of the 30 patients were detected to have positive perfusion in at least one enthesis of the 18 examined entheses, and all together 84 entheses were found to have positive perfusion among the 540 entheses being detected(positive rate 15.6%). The sum of entheseal perfusion detected in all the 18 sites was statistically correlated with the sum of patients' ESR, CRP, BASDAI respectively with the correlation coefficients of 0.658, 0.428 and 0.821 (all P < 0.05). ESR and CRP were also statistically correlated with BASDAI and their correlation coefficients were 0.675 and 0.368(Both P < 0.05). The sum of perfusion detected in the 18 entheses sites was correlated with BASDAI better than ESR or CRP was. Conclusion: Detecting the entheseal perfusion by CD can help to determine the disease activity of patients with SpA, and then to guide selecting therapeutic strategy. It is also important for following up and prognosis.

29144479955	Imaging findings of biliary hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes)	To evaluate the imaging findings of biliary hamartomas (von Meyenburg complexes, vMCs) and discuss their differential diagnosis from other related diseases, imaging findings of biliary hamartomas on ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and hepatobiliary scintigraphy were prospectively analyzed in six patients. On ultrasound images, five of the six cases showed multiple small hyper- and hypoechoic lesions with comet-tail echoes, especially when magnified using the zoom function. In all six cases, multiple tiny hypodense lesions less than 10 mm in diameter were scattered throughout the liver with no enhancement on CT. These tiny lesions were demonstrated to be hyper- and hypointense on T2- and TI-weighted images, respectively, in three patients who underwent MRI examinations. MRCP was performed in two patients, and it clearly showed multiple tiny round and irregular-shaped hyperintense lesions. MRCP and hepatobiliary scintigraphy showed normal appearances of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts in two and one patients, respectively. Imaging modalities are useful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of vMCs. A correct diagnosis might be obtained when typical imaging findings present even without histological confirmation. © The Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine 2005.

29144509505	Hemodynamic and morphologic changes of peripheral hepatic vasculature in chronic liver disease: A preliminary study by contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic sonography	To investigate whether observing the morphology of the peripheral hepatic vasculature and the hemodynamics of microbubble arrival time in these vessels can provide useful information for the diagnosis of liver disease, Five normal volunteers and 16 patients were studied by contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic sonography. Vessel images of the peripheral vessels were observed in real time after intravenous injection of Levovist. The time when the microbubbles appeared in the peripheral vessels was measured. Three patterns of morphologic change of the peripheral hepatic vasculature were seen, marked, slight, and no abnormal changes. The microbubble arrival times at the peripheral vessels were all shorter in patients with cirrhosis than chronic hepatitis or normal subjects. Marked, slight, and no abnormal morphologic changes of the peripheral hepatic vasculature in patients with liver cirrhosis were found in five, one and zero of the six patients, respectively. Those patients with chronic hepatitis, were found in one, six and three of the ten patients, respectively. There was a significant difference among the different groups (P < 0.001). Evaluating the hemodynamics and morphology by contrast-enhanced coded pulse-inversion harmonic sonography may offer useful information in the diagnosis of liver disease. © The Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine 2005.

29144535346	Hepatic angiomyolipoma: Identification of an efferent vessel as a hepatic vein by contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography	Two cases of hepatic angiomyolipoma were studied by contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography. The special tumor hemodynamics, namely the efferent blood flow of the hepatic angiomyolipoma draining into the hepatic vein, were clearly shown on harmonic imaging, and they corresponded well with those seen on angiography and computed tomography during angiography. Benign hepatic tumors were diagnosed preoperatively in both cases according to the hemodynamic findings. Hepatic angiomyolipoma was finally identified histologically. The special tumor hemodynamics might be one of the important characteristics of hepatic angiomyolipoma. Contrast-enhanced harmonic sonography is useful for the detection of special tumor hemodynamics and may facilitate the differential diagnosis from other hepatic tumors, especially malignant liver tumors. © The Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine 2005.

29544439809	Hemodynamic and morphologic changes of peripheral hepatic vasculature in cirrhotic liver disease: A preliminary study using contrast-enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography	Aim: To provide the useful information for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis by observing the morphology of peripheral hepatic vessels and the hemodynamics of microbubble arrival time in these vessels. Methods: Twenty-one subjects including 5 normal volunteers and 16 patients (liver cirrhosis, n=10; chronic hepatitis, n=6) were studied by contrast-enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic sonography (GE LOGIQ 9 series) using a 6-8 MHz convex-arrayed wide-band transducer. The images of peripheral hepatic artery, portal and hepatic vein were observed in real-time for about 2 min after intravenous injection of Levovist. The time when microbubbles appeared in the peripheral vessels (microbubble arrival time) was also recorded. The morphologic changes of peripheral hepatic vasculature were classified as marked, slight, and no changes based on the regularity in caliber, course, ramification, and the delineation of vessels compared to normal subjects. Results: The microbubble arrival time at peripheral artery, portal, and hepatic vein was shorter in cirrhotic patients than in chronic hepatitis patients and normal subjects. The marked, slight and no morphologic changes of peripheral hepatic vasculature found in 5 (5/6, 83.3%), 1 (1/6, 16.7%), and 0 (0/6, 0%) liver cirrhosis patients, respectively, and in 1 (1/10, 10%), 6 (6/10, 60%), and 3 (3/10, 30%) chronic hepatitis patients, respectively. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P<0.001). Conclusion: Evaluation of the hemodynamics and morphology of peripheral hepatic vasculature by contrast-enhanced coded pulse inversion harmonic sonography can provide useful information for the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

31544440401	Value of ultrasound in the evaluation of articular cartilage de-generation in knee	Aim: To probe into the knee joint to be treated with arthroscope and joint replacement by using high-frequency ultrasound, and evaluate the value of ultrasound in the diagnosis of articular cartilage degeneration in knee. Methods: Between February and August 2004, 36 patients underwe nt arthroscopic surgery (37 knee joints) and 4 patients underwent knee arthroplasty (4 knees) were selected from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, including 13 males and 27 females aged 8-75 years with the disease course ranged 1 month to 20 years. The 5 articular surfaces of each knee joint, the cartilages of totally 205 articular surfaces were examined with high-frequency ultrasound. The ultrasonographic manifestations of articular cartilage were compared with the results of arthroscopy and arthroplasty. Results: All the 41 knee joints of 40 patients were involved in the analysis of results. Identification of overall cartilage degeneration by ultrasound was that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 64.9%, 92.0% and 76.5% respectively. The ultrasonographic appearances of cartilage degeneration included localized loss of hyperechoic superficial margin of cartilage, thinness, focal swelling, alteration of echogenicity and irregular subchondral bone surface of the cartilage. Conclusion: Ultrasound has a certain sensitivity and higher specificity in the evaluation of knee aticular cartilage degeneration, and it can be taken as an important means in the diagnosis of knee aticular cartilage degeneration.

40149102228	Portalsystemic hemodynamic changes in chronic severe hepatitis B: An ultrasonographic study	Aim: To evaluate portalsystemic hemodynamic changes in chronic severe hepatitis B. Methods: Hemodynamic parameters included portal vein diameter (PVD), portal vein peak velocity (PVPV), portal vein volume (PVV), spleen length (SPL), spleen vein diameter (SPVD), spleen vein volume (SPVV) and umbilical vein recanalization. They were measured by Color Doppler ultrasonography in 36 patients with chronic severe hepatitis B, compared with 51 normal controls, 61 patients with chronic hepatitis B, 46 patients with compensable cirrhosis, and 36 patients with decompensable cirrhosis. Results: In the group of chronic severe hepatitis B, PVD (12.38 ± 1.23 mm) was significantly different from the normal control, compensable cirrhosis and decompensable cirrhosis groups (P = 0.000-0.026), but not significantly different from the chronic hepatitis group. PVPV (16.15 ± 3.82 cm/s) dropped more significantly in the chronic severe hepatitis B group than the normal control, chronic hepatitis B and compensable cirrhosis groups (P = 0.000-0.011). PVV (667.53 ± 192.83 mL/min) dropped significantly as compared with the four comparison groups (P = 0.000-0.004). SPL (120.42 ± 18.36 mm) and SPVD (7.52 ± 1.52 mm) were longer in the normal control and chronic hepatitis B groups (P = 0.000-0.009), yet they were significantly shorter than those in the decompensable cirrhosis group (P = 0.000). SPVV (242.51 ± 137.70 mL/ min) was also lower than the decompensable cirrhosis group (P = 0.000). The umbilical vein recanalization rate (75%) was higher than the chronic hepatitis B and compensable cirrhosis groups. In the course of progression from chronic hepatitis to decompensable cirrhosis, PVD, SPL and SPVD gradually increased and showed significant differences between every two groups (P = 0.000-0.002). Conclusion: Patients with chronic severe hepatitis B have a tendency to develop acute portal hypertension, resulting in significantly reduced portal vein perfusion. Observation of the portalsystemic hemodynamic changes may be contributed to the disease progression of chronic liver disease. © 2008 WJG. All rights reserved.

33644909885	Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of uterine tumors	Objective: To explore the value of contrast agent (SonoVue) and real-time gray-scale contrast tuned imaging (CnTI) technology in the diagnosis of uterine tumor. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with uterine tumor confirmed by pathology were studied by contrast-enhanced ultrasound with SonoVue and CnTI. The contrast agent was given in bolus intravenously. The perfusion process and the sonographic characteristics of the lesions were observed. Results: The perfusion of agent was from exterior to interior and showed peripheral enhancement especially in the pseudo-capsule of uterine myoma. The myoma showed homogeneous enhancement with earlier wash-out than capsule. The degenerative area demonstrated no agent perfusion. The feeding artery from uterus depicted clearly in subserous and submucous myomas. The nutritious arteries were enhanced earliest in the cervix cancer and endometrial carcinoma. Both of the tumors were heterogeneously enhanced with earlier wash-out than uterine tissue. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed clearly the boundary and interior degeneration of myoma as well as the invasive degree of endometrial carcinoma and cervical cancer, which could improve the value of ultrasound in the diagnosis of uterine tumors.

84876737984	Multifunctionalized microbubbles for cancer diagnosis and therapy	Microbubbles (MBs) are gas-filled hollow microparticles. Under the ultrasound field, the difference of acoustic characteristics between gas and plasma in the blood vessel will cause strong impedance mismatch and echogenicity to enhance ultrasonic grey scale imaging. The linear or nonlinear resonance of MB shell in the ultrasound field would lead to repeated expansion-contraction till destruction. In this case, the pre-loaded drug in the MB shell will be released in an accelerated manner triggered by the ultrasound at a probe-given site. Sonoporation effect of the cell membrane would also help increase the uptake of substances into cells. This paper is dedicated to review recent developments on MBs, especially multifunctionalized MBs, as a potential drug/gene delivery microdevices for both diagnosis and therapy of malignant tumors. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.

84907992407	Normal Liver Stiffness in Healthy Adults Assessed By Real-Time Shear Wave Elastography and Factors That Influence This Method	Real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) is a novel two-dimensional elastographic method that is used to estimate the severity of liver fibrosis. However, the normal range of liver stiffness (LS) and the possible factors that influence SWE are not well understood. The aims of the current study are to define the normal range of LS in healthy subjects and to explore the factors that may affect SWE. A total of 509 healthy subjects underwent SWE to determine the stiffness of their livers, and the effects of gender, age and body mass index (BMI) on LS were analyzed. The effects of different factors on SWE, including the testing position, measurement depth and size ofthe region of interest (ROI), were analyzed in 137 subjects. SWE imaging was successfully performed in 502healthy subjects (98.6%, 502/509). The mean value of the SWE measurements in 502 individuals was 5.10±1.02kPa, and the 95% confidence interval was 5.02-5.19kPa (range: 2.4-8.7kPa). We found that the detective position within the liver had a significant impact on the liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and the lowest coefficient of variation (CV=8%) was obtained for LSMs made at segment V. LS was greater at a depth >5cm (5.78±1.66kPa) compared with depths ≤5cm (4.66±0.77kPa, p<0.001); LS was also greater in men than in women (5.45±1.02kPa vs. 4.89±0.96kPa, p<0.001). However, there were no significant differences in the LS values regarding the size of the ROI, age or BMI (all p>0.05). The mean LS value in all 502 healthy subjects was 5.10±1.02kPa. The mean LS value obtained by SWE was not influenced by the size of the ROI, age or BMI, but the mean value was significantly influenced by the different segments of the liver, the detection depth and gender.

41849108766	CDFI evaluation for therapeutic effect of stent implantation in transplant liver vascular stenosis	Objective: To investigate the value of color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) technique in the assessment of therapeutic effect of stent implantation for transplant liver vascular stenosis. Methods: A total of 16 patients with transplant liver vascular stenosis, including 13 transplant liver artery stenosis, 1 transplant liver portal vein stenosis and 2 transplant liver hepatic vein stenosis, underwent CDFI examination before and after intravascular stent implantation. The resistive index (RI) and systolic acceleration time (SAT) of artery in transplant liver, the diameter of stenosis of portal vein and hepatic vein, the velocity ratio between proximal and distal portal vein stenosis, the Doppler wave of hepatic vein and infer hepatic vena cava were observed and analyzed statistically. Results: The RI increased and SAT prolonged after stent implantation in transplant liver artery stenosis patients (P<O. 05). The diameter of transplant liver portal vein and hepatic vein enlarged, and parallel intermittent string-like echoes were observed after stent implantation in the transplant liver portal vein and hepatic vein. The velocity ratio between proximal and distal portal vein stenosis decreased, while the triphasic or biphasic Doppler wave of hepatic vein and infer hepatic vena cava restored. Conclusion: CDFI technique is one of the ideal and reliable methods for assessment of therapeutic effect of stent implantation for transplant liver vascular stenosis.

44949258047	Diagnostic accuracy of imaging for liver cirrhosis compared to histologically proven liver cirrhosis	Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of liver cirrhosis by imaging modalities, including CT, MRI and US, compared to results obtained from histopathological diagnoses of resected specimens. Materials and Methods: CT, MRI and US examinations of 142 patients with chronic liver disease who underwent surgery for complicated hepatocellular carcinoma (<3 cm in diameter) in 10 institutions were blindly reviewed in a multicenter study by three radiologists experienced in CT, MRI and US. The images were evaluated for five imaging parameters (irregular or nodular liver surface, blunt liver edge, liver parenchymal abnormalities, liver morphological changes and manifestations of portal hypertension) using a severity scale. The diagnostic imaging impression score was also calculated. Patients were histologically classified into chronic hepatitis (CH; n = 54), liver cirrhosis (LC; n = 71) and pre-cirrhosis (P-LC; n = 17) by three pathologists, independently, who reviewed the resected liver specimens. The results of the three imaging methods were compared to those from histological diagnoses, and a multivariate analysis (stepwise forward logistic regression analysis) was performed to identify independent predictive signs of cirrhosis. The diagnostic efficacies for LC and early cirrhosis were also compared among CT, MRI and US using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: The differences in the five imaging parameters evaluated by CT, MRI and US between LC and CH were statistically significant (p < 0.001) except for the manifestations of portal hypertension on US. Irregular or nodular surface, blunt edge or morphological changes in the liver were selected as the best predictive signs for cirrhosis on US whereas liver parenchymal abnormalities, manifestations of portal hypertension and morphological changes in the liver were the best predictive signs on MRI and CT by multivariate analysis. The predictive diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in discriminating LC from CH based on the best predictive signs were 71.9, 77.1 and 67.6% by CT; 67.9, 67.5 and 68.3% by MRI, and 66.0, 38.4 (lower than CT and MRI, p =0.001) and 88.8% (higher than CT and MRI, p =0.001)by US. According to the imaging impression scoring system, diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 67.0, 84.3 and 52.9% by CT; 70.3, 86.7 and 53.9% by MRI, and 64.0, 52.4 (lower than CT and MRI, p =0.0001) and 73.5% (higher than CT and MRI, p < 0.003) by US. ROC analysis showed that MRI and CT were slightly superior to US in the diagnosis of LC but no statistically significant difference was found between them. For the pathological diagnosis of P-LC, cirrhosis was diagnosed in 59.5, 46.7 and 41.7% of the P-LC cases by US, CT and MRI, respectively, with no significant difference among these methods. Conclusion: US, CT and MRI had different independent predictive signs for the diagnosis of LC. MRI and CT were slightly superior to US in predicting cirrhosis, especially regarding sensitivity. Noninvasive imaging techniques play an important role in the diagnosis of cirrhosis, especially in the evaluation of P-LC. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

4644331832	Hepatocellular carcinoma with nodule-in-nodule appearance: Demonstration by contrast-enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic imaging	Objective: A nodule-in-nodule hemodynamic pattern, namely a vascular spot in a hypovascular nodule, is specific for the diagnosis of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of this study was to assess whether this unique hemodynamic pattern can be detected by contrast-enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic imaging (PIHI). Methods: 159 consecutive patients with HCC who underwent contrast-enhanced coded PIHI were retrospectively reviewed. Cases with nodule-in-nodule patterns were selected, and findings were compared with those on computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) and intraarterial contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (US angiography). Results: Contrast-enhanced coded PIHI successfully displayed the nodule-in-nodule hemodynamic pattern in two cases of histologically proven HCC and the hemodynamic transition in one of the two cases, which corresponded well with findings on CTA and US angiography. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced coded PIHI can demonstrate the special nodule-in-nodule hemodynamic pattern. It is useful in the diagnosis and follow-up of early-stage HCC or suspected nodules because of its noninvasiveness and easy performance. Copyright © 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

71249119557	Evaluation of the microcirculatory disturbance of biliary ischemia after liver transplantation with contrast-enhanced ultrasound: Preliminary experience	The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for depicting the perfusion of hilar bile ducts in ischemic-type biliary lesions after orthotopic liver transplantation. Thirteen transplant recipients with ischemic-type biliary lesions and 12 patients without ischemic-type biliary lesions underwent ultrasound examinations after the injection of 1.5 mL of an intravenous contrast agent. The enhancement of the hilar bile duct wall in the arterial, portal venous, and late phases was qualitatively graded as higher, equal, lower, or none with respect to that of the adjacent liver parenchyma. No or low contrast enhancement was seen in 10 of 13 patients (76.90%) with biliary ischemia, whereas increased contrast enhancement with respect to the normal liver parenchyma was found in all 12 patients without biliary ischemia. The difference in the enhancement patterns between the 2 groups was significant (P = 0.0001). In conclusion, contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a new imaging modality to depict perfusion of the hilar bile duct. No or low contrast enhancement of the bile duct wall in the arterial phase may reflect the microcirculatory disturbance of biliary ischemia and may contribute to its early diagnosis. © 2009 AASLD.

74549180421	Usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in the diagnosis of biliary leakage following T-tube removal	Biliary leakage is a serious complication related to T-tube removal. Identifying the location of the leak is important for accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment. We report a case of biliary leakage in the common bile duct (CBD) following a T-tube removal that was successfully diagnosed with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). The micro-bubble contrast medium was administrated into the bile ducts through the percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage catheter. The real-time delineation of contrast agent leaking from the CBD was confirmed by percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. CEUS can be used to detect biliary leakage after T-tube removal. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

77951007334	LyP-1 ultrasonic microbubbles targeting to cancer cell as tumor bio-acoustics markers or drug carriers: Targeting efficiency evaluation in microfluidic channels	Using ultrasonic contrast microbubbles as acoustic biomarkers and drug carrier vehicles by conjugating tumor specific antibody to microbubbles has shown great potential in ultrasonic tumor molecular imaging or drug-delivery and therapy. Microbubble probe targeting efficiency is one of the major challenges. In this study, we developed a novel method to evaluate the targeting capability and efficiency of microbubbles to cells, and more specifically, microbubbles binding LyP-1 (a cyclic nonapeptide acid peptide) target to cancer cell within a microfluidic system. The micro cell sieves within the microfludic channels could trap the tumor cells and enhance the microbubble's interaction with the cell. Assisted with the controllable fluid shear stress, the microbubble's targeting to the cell and the corresponding affinity efficiency could be quantitatively evaluated under a florescent microscope. The system provides a useful low-cost high efficient in vitro platform for studying microbubble-cell interaction for ultrasonic tumor molecular imaging or drugdelivery and therapy. ©2009 IEEE.

77953624400	Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of hepatic artery stenosis after liver transplantation: Potential role in changing the clinical algorithm	Hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) is a common complication in liver transplant patients. Conventional angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Recently, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has begun providing real-time angiographiclike images of vessels and allowing the accurate diagnosis of arterial diseases such as hepatic artery thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CEUS in depicting HAS after liver transplantation. Forty-seven liver transplant recipients underwent CEUS examinations with the intravenous injection of microbubble contrast agents. The reference standard was conventional angiography for 15 patients and computed tomographic angiography for 32 patients. The presence, degree, location, and type of HAS were evaluated. For the detection of HAS by CEUS, the following was found: an accuracy of 91.5% (43/47), a sensitivity of 92.3% (36/39), a specificity of 87.5% (7/8), a positive predictive value of 97.3% (36/37), and a negative predictive value of 70% (7/10). CEUS corrected false-positive findings on color Doppler ultrasound in 7 of 47 cases (14.9%). The accuracy of CEUS in identifying the location and type of HAS was 92.3% (36/39) and 84.6% (33/39), respectively. CEUS is a useful noninvasive technique for the detection of HAS in liver transplant patients because it provides comprehensive information, including the presence, location, degree, and type. A positive CEUS finding suggests angiography as the next step rather than a computed tomography scan and may thereby alter the clinical imaging algorithm. © 2010 AASLD.

77955362071	Evaluating biliary anatomy and variations in living liver donors by a new technique: Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonic cholangiography	Accurate assessment of the biliary anatomy is important for the safety of liver donors in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). We evaluated the biliary anatomy and variations of 12 living liver donors with 3-D contrast-enhanced ultrasonic cholangiography (3-D CEUSC) by injecting microbubble contrast agents into the common hepatic ducts intraoperatively. Two radiologists assessed the diagnostically adequate, delineation of biliary branch orders, visibility scores (grades 0 to 3) and anatomical patterns of the intrahepatic biliary tree by consensus. The results were compared with findings on intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) and surgery. 3-D CEUSC successfully demonstrated the spatial structure of the intrahepatic biliary tree in all 12 donors. The maximum branching order of intrahepatic bile ducts displayed on 3-D CEUSC was the fifth order in the right lobe and fourth order in the left lobe of the liver, respectively. The visibility scores of the first-order (3.00 ± 0.00) and second-order (2.67 ± 0.69) branches were significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of the third-order (1.98 ± 1.13) branches, whereas visibility scores of the second-order (2.88 ± 0.34) and third-order (2.44 ± 1.01) branches in the right lobe were significantly (p = 0.040 and p < 0.001, respectively) higher than those in the left lobe (2.46 ± 0.88 and 1.33 ± 0.99). The 3-D CEUSC images of the 12 donors were diagnostically adequate for evaluating the biliary anatomy. Normal biliary pattern in nine donors and biliary variations in three donors were confirmed by both IOC and surgical findings. 3-D CEUSC may be a potential alternative to IOC in the evaluation of biliary anatomical variation before graft harvesting in LDLT. © 2010 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

77956183905	Ultrasound-guided percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy with a "cooled-tip Needle" for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gallbladder	Background: Curative percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy is difficult or contraindicated in patients with tumors adjacent to the gallbladder because of the associated risk of injury. To date, no clinical data have been published regarding the effects and safety of percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy on tumors that are adjacent to the gallbladder. Aims: We investigated the efficacy and safety of a combined treatment involving laparoscopic cholecystectomy and subsequent percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma adjacent to the gallbladder. Methods: Twenty-three patients with hepatocellular carcinoma nodules (of less than 5 cm diameter) and adjacent to the gallbladder were treated by percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy with a "cooled-tip needle" after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated with enhanced helical computed tomography and sonography, and the rates of complete necrosis as well as postoperative complications were also analyzed. Results: All of the patients exhibited complete necrosis of their tumor lesions after treatment with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy. During the follow-up period (which lasted more than 21 months), 22 of 23 patients were alive. Recurrent nodules appeared in other subsegments, but not at the original site treated with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy. Of note, no fatal complications were observed in any of the patients treated with percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy. Conclusion: Our results suggest that combined treatment comprising both laparoscopic cholecystectomy and subsequent percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy is an effective and safe approach for patients with small (<5 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas that are adjacent to the gallbladder. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

78649273929	The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in uterine leiomyomas	Background Ultrasound (US) is a popular method in the diagnosis and treatment of uterine leiomyomas, but the lack of accuracy greatly limits its application. Recently, microbubble enhancement technique affords direct depiction of tumor neovascularity and establishes a more precise vascular map of the tumor. This study was undertaken to describe the distribution patterns of SonoVue, a second-generation contrast agent, in the microcirculation of uterine leiomyomas, and to investigate the potential use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the characterization and treatment of uterine leiomyomas. Methods Ninety-six patients with uterine leiomyomas were enrolled in this study. The CEUS was performed using cadence pulse sequencing technique (CPS) and SonoVue. Enhancement patterns of different lesions were observed. The diagnostic accuracy of CEUS was compared with that of conventional ultrasound. Results After contrast injection, vessels of macro- and micro-circulation of the myoma first appeared, followed by the normal myometrium and finally the endometrium. During the washout phase, the myoma exhibited homogeneous enhancement followed by apparent hypoenhancement. The margin of the tumor was depicted clearly. There was no agent perfusion in the benign degenerative or necrotic area. However in sarcomas degeneration, the feeding vessels appeared markedly earlier than those in myometrium. In addition, the tumor exhibited heterogeneous hyperenhancment with no agent perfusion in the center and no membraniform sign was observed in the late phase. In subserous and submucous leiomyomas, the feeding arteries in the pedicle arising from the uterine could be seen. In this study, the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS and conventional US for uterine leiomyomas was 96.7% (160/165) and 82.4% (136/165) respectively. Conclusions CEUS can provide a precise description of the leiomyomas vascularization. The specific enhancement pattern may be helpful for the characterization, treatment choice and therapeutic monitoring of leiomyomas.

80055090093	Efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided local injections of etanercept into entheses of ankylosing spondylitis patients with refractory Achilles enthesitis	Objective: Enthesitis is one of the most common and specific manifestations of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). However, the treatment of enthesitis is still a challenge for rheumatologist so far, especially to those AS patients with serious enthesitis. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ultrasound (US)-guided local injection of etanercept into entheses of AS patients with refractory Achilles enthesitis. Methods: Twelve AS patients with severe unilateral refractory Achilles enthesitis were enrolled. Among them, 5 patients received US-guided local injection of etanercept and the other 7 received betamethasone. BASDAI, BASFI, VAS of the affected heel, the percentage of ASAS20 responders, CRP, ESR and any adverse events were recorded at baseline, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the treatment. US was also used to evaluate the corresponding entheses at baseline and every follow-up visit. Results: The BASDAI, BASFI, VAS of the affected heel, CRP, ESR, the percentage of ASAS20 responders and the regional blood flow signals detected by colour Doppler were all improved in both the etanercept group and the betamethasone group, at each follow-up visit compared to the baseline data (p<0.05). There were no significant differences in the improvements of any of the above parameters between the two groups (p>0.05). In addition, there were no adverse events from the etanercept group, except for the mild acid bilges feeling during the injection procedure, while 1 patient from the betamethasone group developed mild local atrophoderma since the week 4 follow-up visit and the atrophoderma kept stable at the 2 subsequent visits. Conclusion: US-guided local injection of etanercept might be a highly effective, safe and well tolerated treatment for Achilles enthesitis in patients with AS. © Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2011.

84860557317	Clinical application of two-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonic cholangiography	Objective: To investigate the clinical value of two-dimensional contrast-enhanced ultrasonic cholangiography (2D-CEUSC) in obstructive biliary tract diseases. Methods: 2D-CEUSC was performed in 33 patients who underwent PTC (twenty-one cases) or T-tube (twelve cases) because of obstructive biliary tract diseases. Image quality, the visualization of branching orders and the judgment of diseases (including whether be obstructive, the level, degree and reason of obstruction) were estimated. And the results were compared with that of conventional cholangiography (CC). Results: Intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts until the obstructive segments were visualized clearly in all 33 2D-CEUSC. The image quality score were well or moderate which could satisfy the diagnostic requirement. However, there was statistically significant difference compared to CC (P=0.005). The maximum visualization of bile branches in 2D-CEUSC was (3.64±0.96), not significantly different with the results (3.79±0.74) of CC (P=0.268). Thirteen of twenty-two patients with obstruction in different level and degree were detected with 2D-CEUSC. The coincidence rate of obstruction in porta hepatic, exceed 50% or complete, and tumorous obstruction was 85.71% (6/7), 100% (3/3), 100% (9/9) and 100% (12/12), respectively. The accurate judged amount of incomplete obstruction due to small lesions was low. Conclusion: As a new method for cholangiography, 2D-CEUSC is close to CC in displaying the intrahepatic biliary branches and determining the obstructive biliary tract diseases. It can be used as supplement in evaluating the biliary obstruction preoperation.

84862321276	Nanobubbles for enhanced ultrasound imaging of tumors	The fabrication and initial applications of nanobubbles (NBs) have shown promising results in recent years. A small particle size is a basic requirement for ultrasound contrastenhanced agents that penetrate tumor blood vessel pores to allow for targeted imaging and therapy. However, the nanoscale size of the particles used has the disadvantage of weakening the imaging ability of clinical diagnostic ultrasound. In this work, we fabricated a lipid NBs contrast-enhanced ultrasound agent and evaluated its passive targeting ability in vivo. The results showed that the NBs were small (436.8 ± 5.7 nm), and in vitro ultrasound imaging suggested that the ultrasonic imaging ability is comparable to that of microbubbles (MBs). In vivo experiments confirmed the ability of NBs to passively target tumor tissues. The NBs remained in the tumor area for a longer period because they exhibited enhanced permeability and retention. Direct evidence was obtained by direct observation of red fluorescence-dyed NBs in tumor tissue using confocal laser scanning microscopy. We have demonstrated the ability to fabricate NBs that can be used for the in vivo contrast-enhanced imaging of tumor tissue and that have potential for drug/gene delivery. 2012 Cárdenas et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

0037309209	Spontaneous regurgitation of portal blood flow normalized by meal intake in a patient with alcoholic liver cirrhosis	We report a case with spontaneous regurgitation of portal blood flow (SRPBF) that was normalized by meal intake. A 41-year-old man with long-term alcohol abuse was admitted with a chief complaint of general fatigue. He was diagnosed as having alcoholic liver cirrhosis since his laboratory tests showed the abnormal liver function. Dynamic computed tomography detected numerous portosystemic shunts. Hepatic arterial portography showed the portal vein was narrow and irregular. Color Doppler imaging portrayed the direction of the blood flows in the branches of the portal vein to be retrograde. However, 30 min after meal intake on the same day, color Doppler study showed the direction of the blood flow in the first branch of right and left portal vein became normal. Color Doppler imaging is a useful technique to detect SRPBF and hemodynamic change in portal venous system after meal intake in patient under a completely physiologic condition. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

0037868114	The levels of serum fibrosis marks and morphometric quantitative measurement of hepatic fibrosis	Objective: To study the relationship between the serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen type III (PCIII), collagen type IV (CIV) and the histological degree of hepatic fibrosis evaluated by image analysis, and the clinical significance of serum HA, PCIII, CIV in the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Methods: The concentrations of serum HA, PCIII, C IV in 151 patients with chronic viral hepatitis were measured by radioimmunoassay. Liver biopsies were performed in all the patients. Histological sections of 4 μm thickness were stained with Masson's trichrome for fibrosis assessment. Morphometric quantitative measurements for hepatic fibrosis assessment in the 4 μm sections were performed using a fully automated image analysis system. Serum levels of HA, PCIII, and CIV were analyzed at different stages of liver pathology and compared with the morphometric quantitative measurements of hepatic fibrosis. Results: The serum levels of HA, PCIII, CIV all elevated gradually with the progression of the disease, and all reached the highest in patients with liver cirrhosis. There was a significant difference in the levels of these 3 components between liver cirrhosis group and the other groups (P < 0.05). They all increased steadily with the histological stages of hepatic fibrosis, and reached the highest levels in stage IV. The serum levels of HA, PCIII, CIV were all positively correlated with the histological stages of liver sections and the morphometric measurement (P < 0.001). The coefficients with stages were 0.694, 0.493, 0.552 (P < 0.001), respectively and with surface density of total collagen on liver biopsy sections by image analysis were 0.715, 0.595, 0.573 (P < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion: The serum levels of HA, PCIII, CIV were in consistent with the degree of hepatic fibrosis, and the determination of these marks is valuable for detecting hepatic fibrosis.

0037973675	Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: Therapeutic response using contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic sonography	OBJECTIVE. This study was performed to evaluate the usefulness of contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic sonography in assessing the therapeutic response of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Sixty-seven patients with a total of 107 examinations on 91 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules underwent coded harmonic angio, a technique of coded phase-inversion harmonic sonography, using the IV microbubble contrast agent Levovist before and after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation. The intratumoral blood vessels and tumor parenchymal stain were detected in the early arterial phase and the late vascular phase, respectively. The results of contrast-enhanced imaging with coded harmonic angio were compared with those of three-phase dynamic CT. RESULTS. Before treatment, all examined 107 hepatocellular carcinoma nodules were found to be hypervascular on contrast-enhanced imaging with coded harmonic angio. After radiofrequency ablation, contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio detected persistent signal enhancement in 41 examined nodules (38.3%), whereas this technique showed no intratumoral enhancement in the remaining 66 (61.7%) examined nodules. Compared with dynamic CT, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio were 95.3%, 100%, and 98.1%, respectively. With contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio, we found that it was difficult to identify the safety margin that can be detected on dynamic CT. CONCLUSION. Contrast-enhanced imaging with coded harmonic angio may provide an alternative approach that has high diagnostic agreement with dynamic CT in assessing the therapeutic effect of radiofrequency ablation in hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas, in spite of having limitations in identifying the safety margin.

84867725658	Comparison on CDFI and CEUS in diagnosis of early and late hepatic artery thrombosis after liver transplantation	Objective: To compare the value of CDFI and CEUS in diagnosis of early and late hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) after liver transplantation. Methods: Totally 64 patients with suspected HAT by CDFI and clinical presentation underwent CEUS. Patients were divided into early HAT patients (<30 days) and later HAT patients (≥30 days). Presence or absence of the proper left and right hepatic arteries were observed, and the peak velocity, resistive index, acceleration time, as well as the presence or absence of turbulence and the peak velocity of turbulence were measured. Taking DSA or CTA + clinical follow-up + sonograms as standards, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of CDFI and CEUS in diagnosis of early and later HAT were calculated. Results: There were 18 early patients and 46 late patients. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of CDFI and CEUS for early HAT patients was 100% (6/6), 83.33% (10/12), 88.89% (16/18) and 100% (8/8), 100% (10/10), 100% (18/18), respectively, while for late HAT patients was 0, 100% (36/36), 78.26% (36/46) and 100% (9/9), 97.30% (36/37), 97.83% (45/46), respectively. Conclusion: Compared with CDFI, CEUS can directly display hepatic artery running, being better than CDFI especially for diagnosis of early HAT after liver transplantation.

84869880443	Intra-biliary contrast-enhanced ultrasound for evaluating biliary obstruction during percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage: A preliminary study	Objectives: The aimed of this study was to investigate the value of intra-biliary contrast-enhanced ultrasound (IB-CEUS) for evaluating biliary obstruction during percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). Materials and methods: 80 patients with obstructive jaundice who underwent IB-CEUS during PTBD were enrolled. The diluted ultrasound contrast agent was injected via the drainage catheter to perform IB-CEUS. Both conventional ultrasound and IB-CEUS were used to detect the tips of the drainage catheters and to compare the detection rates of the tips. The obstructive level and degree of biliary tract were evaluated by IB-CEUS. Fluoroscopic cholangiography (FC) and computer tomography cholangiography (CTC) were taken as standard reference for comparison. Results: Conventional ultrasound displayed only 43 tips (43/80, 53.8%) of the drainage catheters within the bile ducts while IB-CEUS identified all 80 tips (80/80, 100%) of the drainage catheters including 4 of them out of the bile duct (P < 0.001). IB-CEUS made correct diagnosis in 44 patients with intrahepatic and 36 patients with extrahepatic biliary obstructions. IB-CEUS accurately demonstrated complete obstruction in 56 patients and incomplete obstruction in 21 patients. There were 3 patients with incomplete obstruction misdiagnosed to be complete obstruction by IB-CEUS. The diagnostic accuracy of biliary obstruction degree was 96.3% (77/80). Conclusion: IB-CEUS could improve the visualization of the drainage catheters and evaluate the biliary obstructive level and degree during PTBD. IB-CEUS may be the potential substitute to FC in the PTBD procedure. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd© 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84870310262	Enhanced apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells via nanocarrier-mediated codelivery of siRNA and doxorubicin	A folate conjugated ternary copolymer, FA-PEG-PEI-PCL, of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), and poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) was synthesized. The copolymer self-assembled into cationic micelles capable of co-delivering siRNA and the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). This dual functional nanocarrier demonstrated low cytotoxicity and high performance in drug/siRNA delivery. Upon the codelivery of siRNA, targeting the Bcl-2 gene, and DOX, using the folate-targeted nanocarrier, DOX-induced apoptosis in the skov-3 cells overexpressing folate receptor was significantly enhanced through a mechanism of downregulating the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, while simultaneously upregulating the proapoptotic protein Bax. This work suggested that the combination of Bcl-2 siRNA and DOX therapies is feasible, based on our dual functional nanocarrier, which set up a good basis for a future in vivo test. © 2012 Zou et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

84874336075	CT/MR image fusion in evaluating ablative margin after radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma	Objective: To observe the feasibility of CT/MR image fusion for evaluating ablative margin (AM) after radio-frequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Forty-four HCC lesions in 39 patients received RFA and then were diagnosed as completely ablated by CT/MR 1 month later. Using image fusion system, the tumor and AM were outlined in CT/MR images before RFA. Positioning integration of CT/MR image was done before ablation and 1 month after ablation. Fusion images were divided into reached AM group and not reached AM group according to whether the ablative zone could cover the area of index tumor and AM or not. By follow-up, the local tumor progression (LTP) could be monitored and the incidence rate of LTP between the two groups were compared. Results: Image fusion was performed successfully for 43 lesions (43/44, 97.73%) . The average fusion time was 4-11 min ([7.0 ± 2.0]min in average). Evaluation time was 5-10 min ([7.1 ± 1.3]min in average). AM was reached in 24 lesions, among which no LTP occurred during following-up. AM was not reached in 19 lesions, LTP occurred in 4 of them during following-up. The incidence rate of LTP in reached AM group was lower than that of not reached AM group (P=0.031). Conclusion: CT/MR image fusion can accurately evaluate AM of HCC after RFA, and lesions not reached AM after RFA are likely to develop LTP.

84875615823	Ultrasound-sensitive siRNA-loaded nanobubbles formed by hetero-assembly of polymeric micelles and liposomes and their therapeutic effect in gliomas	Ultrasound (US)-sensitive nanobubble (NB) which may utilize the physical power of US exposure to improve delivery efficiency to target cells is emerging as one of the most promising nanocarriers for drug delivery. On the basis of successfully fabricating NBs with the ability of passively accumulating in tumor tissue, in this study we synthesized a US-sensitive NB bearing siRNA (siRNA-NB) for tumor therapy via a hetero-assembling strategy using the siRNA-complexed polymeric micelles and gas-cored liposomes. The US exposure-aided siRNA transfection effectively enhanced the gene silencing effect of siRNA-NBs both in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in much elevated level of cancer cell apoptosis. Consequently, significantly improved therapeutic effect was achieved in a nude mouse glioma model, using siRNA-NBs bearing siRNA to target the anti-apoptosis gene sirtuin 2 (SIRT2). These results show that, with the aid of US exposure, the US-sensitive siRNA-NB may be an ideal delivery vector to mediate highly effective RNA interference for tumor treatment. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875812229	Revealing Impaired Blood Supply to the Bile Ducts on Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound: A Novel Diagnosis Method to Ischemic-Type Biliary Lesions After Orthotropic Liver Transplantation	Ischemic-type biliary lesions (ITBLs) are a major source of morbidity and mortality after orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT). The study determines diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in diagnosing ITBLs. Nine healthy volunteers, six OLT recipients without complications, 36 OLT patients with complications (12 without ITBLs and 24 with ITBLs) underwent CEUS. Two radiologists reviewed the sonograms of the hilar bile duct wall and established specific criteria used to detect ITBLs. Next, the sonograms of six OLT recipients without complications and 36 patients with complications (12 without ITBLs and 24 with ITBLs) were retrospectively reviewed by two other independent, blinded radiologists. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CEUS were evaluated. The main feature differentiating ITBLs from three other groups was non- or hypo-enhancement of the hilar bile duct wall in arterial phase (all p < 0.05), which was selected as the primary criterion for subsequent study. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 66.7%, 88.9% and 76.2% for reader 1 and 62.5%, 88.9% and 73.8% for reader 2, respectively. A good interobserver agreement (. κ = 0.85) was achieved. In this study, CEUS shows promise of detection of ITBLs by revealing impaired blood supply to the bile ducts, but more studies will be needed to establish its usefulness. © 2013 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84879747354	Impact of Multiple Cardiovascular Risk Factors on Carotid Intima-Media Thickness and Elasticity	Background:Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and elasticity have been shown to be independent predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) includes hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, overweight and smoking. The objective was to investigate whether the clustering of three or more components of CVRFs has a greater impact on carotid IMT and elasticity than individual components of CVRFs.Methods:One hundred and seventy-three participants without clinical CVD were classified as the multiple CVRFs patients with three or more CVRFs (n = 55) and control group with two or less CVRFs (n = 118). Carotid IMT and elastic modulus were measured by B-mode ultrasound and vessel texture matching method (VTMM), respectively.Results:The multiple CVRFs conferred a disproportionate increase in carotid IMT (43%, p<0.0001) and elastic modulus (60%, p<0.0001), compared with control group. Multiple regression models, which included age, gender, as well as each individual component of CVRFs as continuous variables, showed that multiple CVRFs was an independent determinant of both IMT (p = 0.042) and elasticity (p = 0.008). In the analysis of variance adjusted with age, subjects with single, double, and multiple CVRFs, increased by 8.1%, 42.2%, and 66% for IMT, 54.6%, 94.3%, and 125.2% for elastic modulus, respectively, compared to subjects without CVRFs.Conclusions:The clustering of multiple CVRFs has a greater impact on carotid IMT and elasticity than individual components of CVRFs. This suggests that the components of CVRFs interact to synergistically impact carotid IMT and elasticity. © 2013 Niu et al.

84885923065	Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in assessing the effect of chemotherapy on cervical cancer	Objective: To observe the value of CEUS in assessing the effect of chemotherapy on cervical cancer. Methods: CEUS was performed before and 2 weeks after chemotherapy in 42 patients with cervical cancer. Time-intensity curves were analyzed to get arriving time (AT), time to peak (TTP) and peak intensity (PI) of contrast media. CEUS results of patients with different chemotherapy efficacy assessed by gynaecology examines combined with MRI were compared. Results: There were 29 cases with response to chemotherapy and 13 without response to chemotherapy. In patients with response to chemotherapy, AT and TTP of contrast dramatically prolonged (P<0.05), while PI decreased (P>0.05) after chemotherapy compared with those before chemotherapy. In patients with no response to chemotherapy, AT and TTP of contrast became shorter, while PI increased (P<0.05) after chemotherapy. Conclusion: Perfusion mode of cervical cancer assessed by CEUS can reflect therapeutic effect, which may provide reliable basis for evaluation of chemotherapy.

84886553606	Quantitative analysis of peri-tumor tissue elasticity based on shear-wave elastography for breast tumor classification	For shear-wave elastography (SWE) images, the most common site of tumor-associated stiffness is generally in the surrounding stroma rather than the tumor itself. The aim of this study is to assess the value of the peri-tumor tissue elasticity in the classification of breast tumors. SWE images of 106 breast tumors (65 benign, 41 malignant) were collected from 82 consecutive patients. By applying the image processing method, 5 elastographic features of the peri-tumor area (elasticity modulus mean, maximum, standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio) were computed to represent peri-tumor tissue elasticity. B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) were used for comparing the diagnostic performances between the grayscale US and color SWE images. Histopathologic results were used as the reference standard. The t-test, point biserial correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. As a result, the Az values (area under ROC curve) were 0.92, 0.95, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.98 for the classifiers using the five elastographic features respectively, and 0.91 for BI-RADS assessment. The results showed that the peri-tumor tissue elasticity could provide valuable information for breast tumor classification. © 2013 IEEE.

0345330196	Liver fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis: An ultrasonographic study	AIM: To select valuable ultrasonographic predictors for the evaluation of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis degree in chronic hepatitis, and to study the value of ultrasonography in the evaluation of liver fibrosis and compensated liver cirrhosis in comparison with serology and histology. METHODS: Forty-four ultrasonographic variables were analyzed and screened using color Doppler ultrasound system in 225 patients with chronic viral hepatitis and compensated liver cirrhosis. The valuable ultrasonographic predictors were selected on the basis of a comparison with histopathological findings. The value of ultrasonography and serology in the evaluation of liver fibrosis degree and the diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis was also studied and compared. Meanwhile, the influencing factors on ultrasonographic diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis were also analyzed. RESULTS: By statistical analysis, the maximum velocity of portal vein and the degree of gall-bladder wall smoothness were selected as the valuable predictors for the inflammation grade (G), while liver surface, hepatic parenchymal echo pattern, and the wall thickness of gall-bladder were selected as the valuable predictors for the fibrosis stage (S). Three S-related independent ultrasonographyic predictors and three routine serum fibrosis markers (HA, HPCIII and CIV) were used to discriminate variables for the comparison of ultrasonography with serology. The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography in moderate fibrosis was higher than that of serology (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the general diagnostic accuracy of fibrosis as well as between mild and severe fibrosis (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between ultrasonography and serology in the diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis. However, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography was higher in inactive liver cirrhosis and lower in active cirrhosis than that of serology (both P<0.05). False positive and false negative results where found when the diagnosis of compensated liver cirrhosis was made by ultrasonography. CONCLUSION: There are different ultrasonographic predictors for the evaluation of hepatic inflammation grade and fibrosis stage of chronic hepatitis. Both ultrasonography and serology have their own advantages and disadvantages in the evaluation of liver fibrosis and compensated liver cirrhosis. Combined application of the two methods is hopeful to improve the diagnostic accuracy.

84891343413	Contrast-enhanced ultrasonic diagnosis of ovarian fibromas	Objective: To explore the enhancement features and clinical value of CEUS in diagnosis of ovarian fibromas. Methods: Totally 46 patients with ovarian fibromas confirmed by pathology underwent CEUS, and the CEUS features, including arrival time, enhancement level, distribution of contrast media and the phase change of enhancement level were observed. The diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for ovarian fibromas was analyzed. Results: Among 46 cases, tumors in 2 cases(2/46, 4.35%) did not enhance, while in 44 cases enhanced, and the arrival time of ovarian fibromas were obviously later than myometrium ([15.87±2.79]s vs [12.01±2.75]s, t=2.87, P<0.05). In early phase, tumors in 35 cases (35/44, 79.55%) demonstrated hypo-enhancement, in 9 cases (9/44, 20.45%) demonstrated iso-enhancement or hyper-enhancement. In the later phase, tumors in 44 cases (44/44, 100%) demonstrated hypo-enhancement. Tumors in 33 cases (33/44, 75.00%) showed diffuse homogeneous enhancement on CEUS. The diagnostic accuracy of CEUS for ovarian fibroma was 89.13% (41/46). Conclusion: Ovarian fibroma has characteristic CEUS features, which may provide information for differential diagnosis.

84891633690	Computer-aided diagnosis based on quantitative elastographic features with supersonic shear wave imaging	Supersonic shear wave imaging (SSI) has recently been explored as a technique to evaluate tissue elasticity modulus and has become a valuable tool for tumor characterization. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that can acquire quantitative elastographic information from color SSI elastography images automatically and objectively for the purpose of classifying benign and malignant breast tumors. Conventional ultrasonography (US) and SSI elastography images of 125 breast tumors (81 benign, 44 malignant), in 93 consecutive patients (mean age: 40y, age range: 16-75y), were obtained. After reconstruction of tissue elasticity data and automatic segmentation of each breast tumor, 10 quantitative elastographic features of the tumor and peri-tumoral areas, respectively (elasticity modulus mean, maximum and standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio), were computed and evaluated. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for optimum classification via combination of these features. The B-mode Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) was used to compare gray-scale US and SSI elastography with respect to diagnostic performance. Histopathologic examination was used as the reference standard. Student's t-test, the Mann-Whitney U-test, the point biserial correlation coefficient and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. As a result, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of benign/malignant classification were 95.2% (119/125), 90.9% (40/44), 97.5% (79/81), 95.2% (40/42) and 95.2% (79/83) for the CAD scheme, respectively, and 79.2% (99/125), 90.9% (40/44), 72.8% (59/81), 64.5% (40/62) and 93.7% (59/63) for BI-RADS assessment, respectively.

84892364673	Computer-assisted assessment of ultrasound real-time elastography: Initial experience in 145 breast lesions	Purpose To develop and evaluate a computer-assisted method of quantifying five-point elasticity scoring system based on ultrasound real-time elastography (RTE), for classifying benign and malignant breast lesions, with pathologic results as the reference standard. Materials and methods Conventional ultrasonography (US) and RTE images of 145 breast lesions (67 malignant, 78 benign) were performed in this study. Each lesion was automatically contoured on the B-mode image by the level set method and mapped on the RTE image. The relative elasticity value of each pixel was reconstructed and classified into hard or soft by the fuzzy c-means clustering method. According to the hardness degree inside lesion and its surrounding tissue, the elasticity score of the RTE image was computed in an automatic way. Visual assessments of the radiologists were used for comparing the diagnostic performance. Histopathologic examination was used as the reference standard. The Student's t test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed for statistical analysis. Results Considering score 4 or higher as test positive for malignancy, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 93.8% (136/145), 92.5% (62/67), 94.9% (74/78), 93.9% (62/66), and 93.7% (74/79) for the computer-assisted scheme, and 89.7% (130/145), 85.1% (57/67), 93.6% (73/78), 92.0% (57/62), and 88.0% (73/83) for manual assessment.

84894311395	How the measurement depth influences the liver stiffness assessment using real-time shear wave elastography (SWE)	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of measurement depth on the results of real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) measurements and to find a reliable measurement depth range for liver stiffness assessment using SWE. SWE measurements were performed on an Elasticity Quality Assurance phantom and healthy volunteers' livers. The different depths from probe surface and from liver capsule were studied in 30 and 88 healthy volunteers, separately. The success rate of measurements (SRoM), success rate of subjects (SRoS), and coefficients of variation (CV) of repeated measurements were calculated and compared. In phantom study, the CV at 2-6cm depth (from 0.6% to 0.9%) was larger than those at the other depths (from 2.8% to 9.8%). For the first group of healthy volunteers, the SRoMs at 3-7cm depths were significantly higher than the others, and the measured results were found to be more reliable at 2-5cm (P<0.001). In the second group of subjects, the SRoSs at 1-4cm depths below liver capsule were all 100% but at 0-1cm depth was zero. According to our results, the most reliable depth range of liver stiffness assessment using SWE should be 3-5cm from the probe surface and simultaneously 1-2cm below the liver capsule. © 2013 IEEE.

84895176861	Influence of Measurement Depth on the Stiffness Assessment ofHealthy Liver with Real-Time Shear Wave Elastography	The purpose of this study was to determine the measurement depth range within which liver stiffness can be reliably assessed using real-time shear wave elastography (SWE) technology. Measurements were performed on phantoms and healthy volunteers. In the first group of patients, measurements were performed at depths of 2-8cm from the probe surface. In the second group of patients, measurements were conducted 0-7cm below the liver capsule. Success rate of measurements (SRoM), success rate of patients (SRoS) and coefficients of variation (CVs) of repeated measurements were compared. The SRoMs at 3-7cm and the CVs at 2-5cm from the probe surface were significantly higher and lower than those at other depths (p<0.001), respectively. SRoS was zero 0-1cm below the liver capsule. Furthermore, the features of 2-D stiffness mapping images were also found to change with depth. According to our results, the depth range for the most reliable liver stiffness assessment using SWE should be 3-5cm from the probe surface and simultaneously 1-2cm below the liver capsule. © 2014 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84899689992	The contribution of qualitative CEUS to the determination of malignancy in adnexal masses, indeterminate on conventional US - A multicenter study	The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of qualitative analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in discrimination of adnexal masses which were undetermined by conventional ultrasound (US). A total of 120 patients underwent transabdominal CEUS. The initial enhancement time and intensity compared with the uterine myometrium, contrast agent distribution patterns and dynamic changes of enhancement were assessed. The sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy (ACC) and Youden's index were calculated for contrast variables. The gold standard was the histological diagnosis. There were 48 malignant tumors and 72 benign tumors. The enhancement features of malignant masses were different from benign ones. Earlier or simultaneous enhancement with inhomogeneous enhancement yielded the highest capability in differential diagnosis, and Sen, Spe, PPV, NPV, ACC, Youden's index was 89.6%, 97.2%, 93.2%, 95.6%, 93.3%, and 0.88, respectively. The qualitative evaluation of CEUS is useful in the differential diagnosis of adnexal masses where conventional US is indeterminate. © 2014 Zhang et al.

84899988976	Tumor-penetrating codelivery of siRNA and paclitaxel with ultrasound-responsive nanobubbles hetero-assembled from polymeric micelles and liposomes	Drug resistance is a big problem in systemic chemotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and nanomedicines loaded with both chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. paclitaxel, PTX) and siRNA's targeting antiapoptosis genes (e.g. BCL-2) possess the advantages to simultaneously overcome the efflux pump-mediated drug resistance and antiapoptosis-related drug resistance. However, tumor-penetrating drug delivery with this type of nanomedicines is extremely difficult due to their relatively big size compared to the single drug-loaded nanomedicines. Aiming at address this problem, US-responsive nanobubbles encapsulating both anti-cancer drug paclitaxel (PTX) and siRNA (PTX-NBs/siRNA) for HCC treatment were developed by hetero-assembly of polymeric micelles and liposomes in the present study. Utilizing an external low-frequency US force imposed to the tumor site, effective tumor-penetrating codelivery of siRNA and PTX was achieved via tail vein injection of PTX-NBs/siRNA into nude mice bearing human HepG2 xerografts. Consequently, the PTX treatment-inducible antiapoptosis in HepG2 cells was effectively suppressed by the codelivered siRNA targeting an antiapoptosis gene (BCL-2 siRNA) during chemotherapy. Owing to the synergistic anti-cancer effect of two therapeutic agents, tumor growth was completely inhibited using low-dose PTX in animal study. Our results highlight the great potential of this type of US-responsive hetero-assemblies carrying both anti-cancer drug and siRNA as an effective nanomedicinal system for HCC therapy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

12144290150	Characterization of Hepatic Tumors: Value of Contrast-Enhanced Coded Phase-Inversion Harmonic Angio	OBJECTIVE. Our purpose was to evaluate the value of contrast-enhanced coded phase-inversion harmonic imaging in showing the characteristic intranodular hemodynamics of hepatic tumors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Using a microbubble contrast agent we performed coded harmonic angio in 163 patients with 192 hepatic tumor nodules: 153 hepatocellular carcinomas, 13 metastases, 14 hemangiomas, eight dysplastic nodules, and four focal nodular hyperplasias. After injecting Levovist, we performed real-time scanning, interval-delay fast low-angle shot imaging, and sweep scanning in the early arterial phase, late vascular phase, and postvascular phase, respectively. RESULTS. On contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio, the typical hemodynamic pattern of hepatocellular carcinomas was shown as abundant tumor vessels supplied from the periphery to the center of the tumor and dense parenchymal tumor staining with fast washout (sensitivity, 92.8%; specificity, 92.3%). The characteristic hemodynamic pattern of metastases was peripheral tumor vessels with a rim parenchymal stain in the vascular phase followed by a perfusion defect in the postvascular phase (sensitivity, 69.2%; specificity, 100%). Hemangiomas were hypovascular in the early arterial phase with gradual spotty or cotton-wool pooling continuing to the late vascular phase (sensitivity, 92.9%; specificity, 100%). Dysplasfic nodules were shown as having no early arterial supply with isovascularity in the late vascular phase (sensitivity, 75%; specificity, 100%). Focal nodular hyperplasias were shown to have a spoked wheel pattern of blood vessels accompanied by dense staining in interval-delay scanning (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 100%). CONCLUSION. Contrast-enhanced coded harmonic angio is a promising method to provide useful information for the differential diagnosis of hepatic tumors.
