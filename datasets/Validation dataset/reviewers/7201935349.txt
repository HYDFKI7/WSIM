0030358789	Blue light-emitting diodes from polymer blends	Electroluminescence (EL) is reported from a novel polymer blend of poly(2,5-dibutoxyphenylene) (PPP) and polymer poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK). Since PPP and PVK are soluble in common organic solvents, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be fabricated by spin-coating films of the polymer blends from solution without subsequent processing or heat treatment. Indium-tin-oxide (ITO) and aluminum (Al) are used as the hole-injection and electron-injection electrodes, respectively. Blue light emission is observed at about 8 V and have a peak emission wavelength at 448 nm at room temperature. The EL efficiency is about 0.82%, which is greater than.that of pure PPP by approximately one order of magnitude.

Using contact-mode atomic force microscopy, we have characterized the formation and structure of such silver pattern assemblies on a microcontact-printed SAM patterned surface. SERS spectra and surface enhanced Raman mapping (SERM) of 4-pyridinethiol SAMs on this novel SERS-active substrate were also investigated. Different SERS activities were observed on the surface of the hierarchical micro/nanostructure. The enhancement factor was studied in detail and the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism was used to explain the SERS effect. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

33749620740	Charge carrier photogeneration in conjugated polymer PhPPV/R6G composite system	The spectral and polarity dependence of the quantum yield of charge carrier photo-generation was studied by steady-state photocurrent measurement in a single layer PhPPV film, double layer film of PhPPV and R6G and doped film of PhPPV with R6G. The intrinsic and extrinsic charge carrier photogeneration was observed. The result indicates that the quantum efficiency of the double layer device is higher than that of single layer device under reverse bias, but it is opposite under forward bias. The yield of charge carrier photogeneration of the doped film is higher than that of the other two films at both forward and reverse bias because of the increased interface area between the electron donor and acceptor.

33751517121	Electronic structures and optical properties of two anthracene derivatives	The electronic structures and the optical properties of two anthracene derivatives, DBMA and DAA, are investigated by both experimental techniques and quantum chemical calculations. The cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse polarograph measurement revealed that the introduction of benzol-imidazol and pyrrolo-pyridine group on the anthracene block can affect the electrochemical behavior of DBMA and DAA. Both UV/visible absorption and emission spectra of DBMA and DAA are red-shifted in contrast to the unsubstituted anthracene, so that the anthracene derivatives emit at blue-green region and the luminescence yields are remarkably elevated (over 90%). The B3LYP/6-31G theoretical calculations explored that the electronic structures of the anthracene derivatives are perturbed by the side substitutes on the anthracene block, and the slight variation of the electronic structures results in the enhanced electron accepting ability and the decrease of the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, which is the origin of the emission to be shifted to blue-green region. The non-planar geometry structures of DBMA and DAA are responsible for the excellent luminescence yields. © 2006 Science in China Press.

33751573901	Study on the energy transfer and luminescent properties in PVK: DBVP blend system	The energy transfer and the luminescence properties of polyvinyl-carbazole(PVK) and oligomeric phenylenevinylene derivative (2,5-dodecyloxy-l ,4-(biphenyl -enevinyl )phenyl) (DBVP)blend system were studied. The energy transfer between PVK and DBVP was investigated by the UV-vis absorption spectra, photoluminescent excitation(PLE) spectra and photoluminescent(PL) spectra of PVK / DBVP blend system. The electroluminescence(EL) properties of the blend system were investigated by characterization with the device ITO / PEDOT / PVK: DBVP (w/w) / LiF / Al. The PL and EL spectra of PVK in the PVK / DBVP system were effectively quenched, which means the effective energy transfer between PVK and DBVP. Because PVK matrix acted as solid solvent, the emission performance of the blend system could be adjusted and improved by changing the ratio of PVK and DBVP. The luminescence efficiency is up to 1.06cd / A at 52cd / m

HOMO energy levels (-5.75- -6.20 eV) of the alkoxyl-substituted derivatives are much higher than that of the unsubstituted one, especially the one with lateral alkyoxyl groups.

34548451513	Novel donor-acceptor molecules as donors for bulk heterojunction solar cells	Three novel donor-acceptor molecules (BCPD, BPPD and PDHC) have been investigated as donors for the bulk heterojunction solar cells. BCPD and BPPD have the same acceptor group of TPO while BCPD and PDHC have the similar donor group of carbazole. The absorption data indicates that the introduction of either strong electron-donating group or strong electron-withdrawing group will induce the red shift of ICT transition absorption. Electrochemistry measurement shows that the three compounds present reversible or partly reversible oxidation and reduction processes. When the donor moiety was changed from carbazole to phenothiazine, the oxidation potentials shifted from 1.10 V to 0.72 V. While the acceptor moiety was changed from TPO to CEM, the reduction potentials shifted from -1.42 V to -0.92 V. The bulk heterojunction solar cells using the three compounds as donors and PCBM as acceptor were fabricated. The cell based on PDHC containing strong electron-accepting group shows a relatively high energy conversion efficiency of 0.51% under the illumination of white light at 100 mW cm

34547467700	Solvent and electric field dependence of the photocurrent generation in donor: Acceptor blend system	This paper reports that the blend films of poly (2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethyl- hexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV) and N,N'-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4: 9,10-perylene bis (tetracarboxyl diimide) (EP-PDI) with the weight ratio of 1:2.5 have been prepared by spin-coating from chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB) solutions respectively. The absorption spectra and the morphology of the blend films show that large crystal-like EP-PDI aggregates are formed in film prepared from CB solution, which corresponds to a new absorption shoulder near 590 nm, while there is no shoulder around 590 nm in the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the blend film from CF solution. The electric-field dependence spectra of the photocurrent generation quantum yield of the film from CB solution shows that at weak electric field the EP-PDI aggregates act as more efficient sensitizers, but at strong electric field the quantum yields become almost invariable over the entire spectral range no matter what the state of EP-PDI, monomer or aggregate. At strong electric field, the photocurrent generation yields of both films from CF and CB solution saturate and their yield spectra become spectrally similar, mentioning that at strong electric field the photoexcitons dissociate efficiently and the free charges are collected by the electrodes almost completely. © 2007 Chin.

34548536878	Spectrally dependent photocurrent generation in aggregated MEH-PPV:PPDI donor-acceptor blends	Films of MEH-PPV and PPDI blends with weight ratio 1:2 have been prepared by spin-coating and annealing between 0 and 60 min at 95 °C. The films were characterized by absorption spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The main emphasis has been on the photon conversion efficiency in the photovoltaic cells as a function of excitation wavelength and applied voltage/electric field. Site selective excitation at wavelengths at which either non-aggregated bulk PPDI or dimers/aggregates of PPDI absorb prove that (i) the rate-limiting process for power conversion is the field-assisted escape of optically generated geminate electron-hole pairs from their mutual coulombic potential and (ii) the photogeneration yield depends on the donor-acceptor topology. A significant difference of the yield has been noted when alkoxy-pendent groups in MEH-PPV are replaced by phenyl-alkoxy groups. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results show that the phase separation in the blend film using non-aromatic solvents is of micron (0.5-5 μm) size, which leads to low charge separation efficiency and consequently the low power conversion efficiency of the assembled solar cell; whereas the phase separation in the blend film using aromatic solvents is of nano-size, which increases the interface area of the two phases obviously and consequently increases the ratio of charge separation significantly. The power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on MEH-PPV: EP-PTC blend film using aromatic solvents is improved 30 times of magnitude compared with that of solar cell based on the blend film using non-aromatic solvents.

The optical, electrochemical and thermal properties of the OXDs were investigated by using UV-Vis, PL, CV and DSC. It is indicated that intramolecular exciplex can be formed between the 4-methoxyphenoxy and bis[2-(4-alkyoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxidiazol] and the end-alkoxy groups could restrain the formation of the intramolecular exciplex. The electrochemical properties of the OXDs show that OXDs were favorable for the electron injecting, transporting and hole blocking. DSC results prove that when the OXDs were substituted with shorter alkoxy groups (or without substituents), the crystal contents in OXDs were less in solid state and the stable non-crystalline morphology can be formed after heat-treating.

These molecules were used to investigate pure conformational effects on molecular emissions. The spectral properties of these molecules in five environments of crystal(s), THF solution, THF-water binary solution, solidified THF and amorphous states, were investigated.

The AFM images show that the dimension of the phase separation increases with the EP-PTC content and total solution concentration. When the annealing temperature increases from 90 to 150 °C, the EP-PTC crystal-like clusters grow rapidly. Solar cells based on MEH-PPV:EP-PTC blend films with different weight ratios were fabricated. The device with 1:3 weight ratio has a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.072% compared with the devices with 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 ratio, which increases by about 14 times over that of the device with 1:1 ratio that has a PCE of 0.005%. It is indicated that the optimum performance of the photovoltaic device is strongly related to the finer phase separation between MEH-PPV and EP-PTC on a submicron scale which enables an efficient dissociation of photogenerated excitons, and the pure EP-PTC phase can build up a percolating network with pathways large enough to enhance electron transport. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

77958590024	Synthesis and photovoltaic properties of solution processable small molecules containing 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile and oligothiophene moieties	A series of solution processable small molecules (4TPM, 6TPM, and 8TPM) were synthesized with 2-pyran-4-ylidenemalononitrile (PM) as the electron-accepting unit and oligothiophene with different numbers as the electron-donating unit. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicated that melting point and crystal temperature of molecules increased with the increase of thiophene number. UV-vis absorption demonstrated that the combination of PM with oligothiophene resulted in an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, which led to an extension of the absorption of the molecules.

78649359847	Solution processable D - A small molecules for bulk-heterojunction solar cells	Solution processable small molecules have been widely applied for photovoltaic (PV) devices in recent years because they show strong absorption properties, and they can be easily purified and deposited onto flexible substrates at low cost. Introducing different donor and acceptor groups to construct donor-acceptor (D-A) structure small molecules has proved to be an efficient way to improve the properties of organic solar cells (OSCs). This review deals with the recent progress of solution processable D-A structure small molecules and discusses the key factors affecting the properties of OSCs based on D-A structure small molecules: sunlight absorption, charge transport and the energy level of the molecules. Then we give some suggestions for designing new solution processable D-A structure small molecules for high performance OSCs. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

78650833528	Excited-state relaxation processes of DPA-DSB: Investigation of the reason for high fluorescence quantum yield of symmetric D-π-D molecule	The temporal evolution of excited states of a symmetric D-π-D structure two-photon absorption material, 1,4-di(4′-N,N-diphenylaminostyryl) benzene (DPA-DSB), was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectrum and solvent polarity dependent fluorescence properties. The results suggested that the structure of DPA-DSB did not change much during the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) process, which could be the reason for good radiative ability of the ICT state. The major non-radiative deactive channel may be a large structure-changed process, which was formed more slowly than the radiative ICT state. Symmetric charge-transfer in this D-π-D structure molecule could make the non-radiative structure-changed process slow and ineffective, which should be the reason for the high fluorescence quantum yield. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicates that APPM and AAPM shows relatively high glass-transition temperature of ca. 137 °C and 163 °C, while the melting point of ATPM is at ca. 164 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra show that the combination of the PM moiety with moieties with a gradually increased electron-donating ability results in an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition, which leads to an extension of the absorption spectral range and a reduction of the band gap of the molecules.

The successful reduction of GO was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The obvious fluorescence quenching of P3KT by a-dG in the solid films due to the efficient charge transfer between P3KT and a-dG demonstrated that a-dG could be expected to be used as the electron acceptor in the polymer solar cell (PSC) devices.

It was found that the dominate factor is the extent of intramolecular charge transfer upon photoexcitation, rather than coherent coupling between branches. This result suggests that it is more effective to change the electron withdrawing ability or electron giving ability of branches and core than simply increase the number of branches for enhancing the TPA ability in multibranched structure molecules. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84860378382	Using fluorine-containing amphiphilic random copolymers to manipulate the quantum yields of aggregation-induced emission fluorophores in aqueous solutions and the use of these polymers for fluorescent bioimaging	Two new series of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophore-containing amphiphilic copolymers possessing the segments of a monomeric AIE fluorophore, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA), [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride (MATMA), and/or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA), were synthesized. Photophysical properties were investigated using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence spectrofluorometry. The increases of molar fractions of the hydrophobic AIE fluorophores and/or the trifluoroethyl moieties result in the higher quantum yields of the AIE fluorophores in the polymers. Using 1 mol% of AIE fluorophores with the tuning of molar fractions of TFEMA, 40% quantum yield was achieved, whereas only less than 10% quantum yield was obtained for the polymers without the TFEMA segments. The quantum yield difference indicates the importance of the fluorine segments for getting high quantum yields of the AIE fluorophores. These polymers were explored for fluorescent bioimaging using human brain glioblastoma U87MG and human esophagus premalignant CP-A cell lines.

Photophysical properties were investigated using UV-Vis absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Influences of the polymer structures with different molar ratios of the AIE fluorophores on their photophysical properties were studied. Results show that the AIE fluorophores aggregate in the cores of the micelles formed from the amphiphilic random copolymers and polymers with more hydrophobic AIE fluorophores facilitate stronger aggregations of the AIE segments to obtain higher quantum efficiencies. The polymers reported herein have good water solubility, enabling the application of hydrophobic AIE materials in biological conditions.

They are all soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, tetrahydronfuran and 1,1,2,2- tetrachloroethane. The chemical structures of MEH-OXD-PPVs were determined by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, GPC and elemental analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that they have good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature ranging from 312°C to 326°C. The absorption and fluorescence emission maxima of the polymers exhibit an appreciable blue-shift with the increase of oxadiazole-containing moieties. Electrochemical investigation shows that the HOMO energy levels of the polymers vary regularly with the change of content of oxadiazole-containing moieties. Additionally, by introducing more OXD-PV unit during copolymerization, the PL quantum efficiencies of the polymers are significantly enhanced compared to that of MEH-PPV. The successful manipulation of optical and electronic properties of the MEH-OXD-PPVs indicates an effective concept for developing PPV-based functional materials with tunable optoelectronic properties by changing the amount of electron-withdrawing oxadiazole-containing moieties. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

Here we report their crystal structures, structure-property relationships, and nanowire fabrication. The crystal structures indicate that the three compounds with varying substituents exhibit different molecular packing modes. In particular, introducing a F substituent to generate weak intermolecular C-H⋯F interactions benefits the formation of intermolecular π-π stacking in the TFMDSA and TFDSA crystals. Photophysical investigations and crystal structure analysis indicate that inhibition of vibrational relaxation in the aggregate state should be the origin for the high fluorescence and blueshift in crystals of our materials. By controlling the experimental conditions, TFDSA could easily achieve perfect regular 1D nanowires, in which the weak intermolecular C-H⋯F interaction together with effective π-π interaction play a significant role. High quantum efficiency (75% for TFDSA) and regular 1D nanowires suggest that this kind of material may have potential applications in optoelectronic device applications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.

84871641475	Aqueous-solution-processed hybrid solar cells with good thermal and morphological stability	To fabricate efficient solar cells, it is crucial to control the nanoscale morphology of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) film, in which the thermal and morphological stability is an important issue. In this article, aqueous-solution-processed hybrid photovoltaic devices from poly(1,4-naphthalene vinylene) (PNV) and CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) are fabricated and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.74% under AM1.5G illumination is achieved. Furthermore, we demonstrate the high thermal stability of hybrid solar cells by investigating the evolution of hybrid films with prolonged annealing time and elevated temperature. Thermal annealing is necessary for converting PNV precursor to PNV and removing the ligands on CdTe NCs, which leads to the improvement of device performance. In particular, the prolonged annealing time and elevated temperature do not lower the PCE, because the interconnected CdTe networks are highly rigid and thereby suppress the excess phase separation of PNV, which is one of the main issues determining the long-term stability of polymer-based photovoltaic devices. This advantage is considered to promote the development of hybrid solar cells from various aqueous-solution-processed polymers and NCs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Applied to targeted cancer cell imaging, FNPs are highly desirable for early stage cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, the light emission from most of the FNPs reported is severely limited because of the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. Herein, we present highly emissive inorganic-organic nanoparticles with core-shell structures for targeted cancer cell imaging. Coated with a folate-functionalized silica shell, 9,10-distyrylanthracene (DSA) fluorogens with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties served as the fluorescent core, affording folate-functionalized fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FFSNPs) with a high fluorescence quantum yield (up to 20%). The FFSNPs are of small size (diameter ∼60 nm), monodispersed, stable in aqueous suspension, and pose little toxicity to living cells and thus can be utilized for targeted HeLa cell imaging. In addition, the FFSNPs are mesoporous and therefore can potentially be used as vehicles for controlled, externally activated release of anticancer drugs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

These oligomers show good solubility in common organic solvents. Their photophysical, electrochemical, electronic structure and charge transfer properties between these star-shaped π-conjugated oligomers and N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-3, 4:9,10-perylene bis(tetracarboxyl diimide) (EP-PDI) have been investigated by UV-vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence (PL) spectra, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, theoretical calculations and fluorescence quenching. The results show that the absorptions and fluorescences of TPA-CZ3, TPA-TPA3 and TPA-PTZ3 are red shifted with the electron-donating ability of the peripheral unit increasing from carbazole to triphenylamine and phenothiazine. In addition, although the bithiophene group has a weaker electron-donating ability than carbazole, triphenylamine and phenothiazine, the absorption and fluorescence of TPA-BT3 have a red shift than those of TPA-CZ3, TPA-TPA3 and TPA-PTZ3 because TPA-BT3 has a longer conjugation length than TPA-CZ3, TPA-TPA3 and TPA-PTZ3. The triphenylamine core and the peripheral units can constitute a large conjugated structure. The fluorescence quenching properties indicate that efficient charge transfer can happen between the star-shaped oligomers and EP-PDI. The core of these new star-shaped oligomers is electron-donating group, triphenylamine. The peripheral units are four hole-transporting chromophores with different electron-donating ability. The photophysical properties of these oligomers can be tuned through changing the electron-donating ability and conjugation length of the peripheral units. © 2013 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The introduction of pyridine in BP4VA leads to multi-stimuli responsive fluorescence. An investigation of the photophysical and stimuli responsive luminescent properties of BP4VA, including the piezochromism and protonation effect, demonstrates that the piezochromic luminescence originates from changes in the molecular aggregation state. Additionally, protonation-deprotonation of the pyridine moieties in BP4VA has a significant effect on the frontier molecular orbitals, resulting in distinct green and red emissions under acid and base stimuli. This study on BP4VA provides a comprehensive insight into the mechanisms within this type of stimuli-responsive luminescent material, and suggests that BP4VA may be a potential candidate for applications in sensing, detection and display devices with remarkable color-changing properties. © 2013 'The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Time-resolved fluorescence spectra revealed that the twisted intramolecular charge transfer state formed in polar solvents accounts for the weak emission with large Stokes shifts, and the interactions between solvent and solutes facilitate the nonradiative decay.

Herein, we reported a series of conjugated dendrimers (AnG0, AnG1, and AnG2) which showed weak emissions in dilute solution due to the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) and free intramolecular rotational motion. On the contrary, high luminescence quantum yields (up to 0.85) have been observed in the nanoaggregated and solid-state because of the restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR) and the more planar conformation, which has been demonstrated by experimental and theoretical investigations. These dendrimers possess an obviously large intrinsic two-photon absorption cross-section (up to 5180 GM), which is enhanced with the increase of the generation number. Due to the high solid-state luminescence quantum yields, an intense two-photon excited fluorescence with a larger Stokes shift can be obtained from these dendrimers as nanoaggregates and thin films. Thus, these dendrimers successfully provide large two-photon action cross-sections in the nanoaggregated or solid-state and have the potential for nonlinear optical applications. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

Besides, for the determination of ssDNA, S1 nuclease, and inhibitor, the DSA-based probe provides high sensitivity and a good linear relationship due to the AIE property.

Using the F127-FA as the encapsulation matrix, the folate-functionalized AIE NPs show bright fluorescence signals and specific targeting effect for FR-overexpressed cancer cells. These studies indicate that the F127-FA encapsulated AIE NPs are efficient fluorescent probes for biological imaging. © 2014 The Partner Organisations.

84901327676	Folic acid-functionalized AIE Pdots based on amphiphilic PCL-b-PEG for targeted cell imaging	Fluorescent block amphiphilic copolymers are one of the most important bioimaging materials which are highly desirable for early stage cancer diagnosis and treatment. However, sometimes the application of the fluorescent block copolymers is severely limited because of the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. In this study, new aggregation induced emission polymer dots (AIE Pdots) were prepared through a self-assembly process by using an AIE-conjugated block copolymer containing an AIE fluorophore, 9,10-bis(4-hydroxystyryl) anthracene, hydrophobic poly(ε-caprolactone) segments, hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) segments and folate groups. The AIE Pdots are monodispersed in H

84901381768	Synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic properties of acceptor-donor-Acceptor organic small molecules with different terminal electron-withdrawing groups	Two soluble acceptor-donor-Acceptor (A-D-A) type organic small molecules, 2,2′-(5,5′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4, 7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)bis(3,4-dihexylthiophene-5,2-diyl)) bis(methan-1-yl-1-ylidene)dimalononitrile (BvT-DCN) and 2,2′-(3,3′- (1E,1′E)-2,2′-(5,5′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)bis(3,4-dihexylthiophene-5,2-diyl)) bis(ethene-2,1-diyl)bis(5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-ene-3-yl-1-ylidene)) dimalononitrile (BT-C6), were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation reaction based on benzothiadiazole, thiophene, and different terminal electron-withdrawing groups. The acceptor group benzothiadiazole and donor group thiophene inside the molecules are connected by all-trans double bonds, which ensures the benzothiadiazole and thiopene groups are in the same plane and makes the molecules have a relative narrow band gap and absorb sunlight in the long wavelength. The terminal electron-withdrawing groups, malononitrile and 2-(5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCM), are symmetrically introduced into the molecules, respectively, to tune the energy level and extend the absorption of the molecules. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum and cyclic voltammetry measurements indicated that BT-C6 has a lower energy band gap (1.60 eV) than BvT-DCN (1.71 eV), which arises from the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of DCM group in BT-C6 than that of malononitrile group in BvT-DCN. And BvT-DCN and BT-C6 have nearly the same highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, -5.74 eV for BvT-DCN and -5.72 eV for BT-C6 due to the same electron-donor group of the two compounds. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using BvT-DCN or BT-C6 as donor and (6,6)-phenyl C

84905641572	The substituent effect on charge transport property of triisopropylsilylethynyl anthracene derivatives	The charge transport property of two triisopropylsilylethynyl anthracene (TIPSAnt) derivatives TIPSAntBt and TIPSAntNa (bithiophene and naphthalene are introduced at the 2, 6-positions of the TIPSAnt core) were explored through quantum chemical method. To gain a better understanding of the substituent effect on the charge transport property, the results of the parent molecule TIPSAnt was also provided here for comparison. The substituent effect on the molecular geometry, reorganization energy, frontier orbitals, ionization potential (IP) and electronic affinity (EA), crystal property, transfer integrals and charge mobility, band structure and effective mass of the two compounds were investigated to establish the relationship between structures and properties. The introduced bulky TIPS groups made the two compounds adopt two-dimensional, face-to-face, π-stacking structures. The efficient overlaps of π-orbital and smaller π-stacking distance are proved to be the main reason for the high charge mobility of TIPSAntBt and TIPSAntNa. The hole mobilities of TIPSAntBt and TIPSAntNa are 0.88 and 3.60 cm

84906722821	Synthesis, characterization, and photovoltaic properties of a solution-processable two-dimensional-conjugated organic small molecule containing a triphenylamine core	A novel solution-processable two-dimensional-conjugated organic small molecule based on triphenylamine (TPA) core, (E)-2-(3-(4-(bis(4-(3-hexyl-5-(7-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c] [1,2,5] thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)amino)styryl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (TPA-TBT), has been designed and synthesized by Knoevenagel reaction. Different from the linear or star-shaped TPA derivatives, in TPA-TBT, two arms of the TPA core are symmetrically connected with the acceptor segment 4,7-di(2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (DTBT), but the third arm is connected with a strong acceptor group, 2-(5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCM), connected through a trans double bond with the TPA core. TPA-TBT has a relatively low optical band gap (1.91 eV) and a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (-5.53 eV). Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using TPA-TBT as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl C

84907834095	Solution-processable two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules containing triphenylamine cores for photovoltaic application	Two solution-processable two-dimensional conjugated organic small molecules based on triphenylamine (TPA) cores, TPA-BT-C8 and TPA-3Th, were designed and synthesized. As to TPA-BT-C8, two arms of the TPA core are symmetrically connected with a thiophene donor group and a benzothiadiazole acceptor group, while the third arm consists of a strong acceptor group of 2-(5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-en-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCM) connected through a trans double bond with the TPA core. For TPA-3Th, two arms of its TPA core are composed of only donor group, terthiophene, whereas the third arm consists of an acceptor group of cyano-n-octyl acetate connected through a trans double bond with the TPA core. The investigation indicated that TPA-BT-C8 has a lower energy band gap and wider absorption than TPA-3Th due to the strong intramolecular charge transfer effect in TPA-BT-C8. The two molecules have a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. Bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices were fabricated using TPA-BT-C8 or TPA-3Th as the donor and (6,6)-phenyl C

84910130455	Ultra bright red AIE dots for cytoplasm and nuclear imaging	An aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecule (2-(2,6-bis((E)-2-(5-(N,N-bis(4-((E)-2-(10-((E)-4-(diphenylamino)styryl)anthracen-9-yl)vinyl)phenyl)aniline-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)vinyl)-4 H-pyran-4-ylidene)-malononitrile) (TPA-AN-TPM) with near-infrared emission was synthesized by coating a disc-like red emission fluorophore with a propeller-shaped AIE fluorophore. The ultrabright red AIE dots TPA-AN-TPM@PS-PVP (TPA-AN-TPM in poly(styrene)-poly(4-vinylpyridine) nanoparticles) with an absolute quantum yield of 12.9% were fabricated by using the AIE molecule TPA-AN-TPM as the core and one biocompatible polymer PS-PVP as the encapsulation matrix. The AIE dots are mono-dispersed with an average diameter of 25 nm, and are stable in an aqueous suspension. In particular, the AIE dots can stain both the cytoplasm and the nuclei with a strong red fluorescence signal, and pose little toxicity to living cells.

84911361468	An efficient photovoltaic device based on novel D–A–D solution-processable small molecules	A series of novel small molecule PHPD, TPAPD, and CZPD were designed and synthesized for probing their potential applications in photovoltaic devices. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement reveals that PHPD displays amorphous property, while both TPAPD and CZPD exhibit crystalline properties. Ultraviolet–Visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectra demonstrate that these small molecules possess relatively broad absorption with absorption edges of 706 nm (PHPD), 671 nm (TPAPD), and 632 nm (CZPD), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) investigation indicates that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels were well tuned (−4.97, −5.24, and −5.38 eV) with the introduction of different electron-donating moieties. The device based on CZPD without further optimization displays the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.00 % among three small molecules (1.21 % for TPAPD and 0.28 % for PHPD), which stands out as one of the highest values for photovoltaic devices based on 3-carbazole (CZ) derivatives. This result would uncover the potential applications of 3-carbazole-based donor materials for organic solar cells.
