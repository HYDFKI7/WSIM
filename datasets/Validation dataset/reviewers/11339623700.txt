9244263530	Transabdominal ultrasonography in preoperative staging of gastric cancer	Aim: To investigate the value of transabdominal ultrasonography (US) in the preoperative staging of gastric cancer. Methods: A total of 198 patients with gastric cancer underwent preoperatively transabdominal US, depth of tumor infiltration was assessed in 125 patients, and lymph node metastasis was assessed in 106 patients. Results: The staging accuracy of transabdominal US was 55.6%, 75.0%, 87.3% and 71.1% in T1, T2, T3 and T4 carcinomas, respectively. The overall accuracy was 77.6%. The detection rate for pancreatic invasion and liver invasion was 77.4%, 71.4%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy of transabdominal US in assessment of lymph node metastasis were 77.6%, 64.1%, 72.6%, respectively. Various shapes such as round, ovoid, spindle were encountered in benign and malignant lymph nodes. Majority of both benign and malignant lymph nodes were hyperechoic and had a distinct border. Benign lymph nodes were smaller than malignant lymph nodes in length and width (P = 0.000, 0.005). Irregular shape, fusional shape, infiltrative signs, inhomogenous echo were seen mainly in malignant lymph nodes (P = 0.045, 0.006, 0.027, 0.006). Conclusion: Transabdominal US is useful for preoperative staging in gastric cancer, although it is difficult to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes. Copyright © 2004 by the WJG Press.

22744450235	Standard treatment of liver malignancies with radiofrequency ablation	Objective: To investigate the role of standard treatment with ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in improving the treatment level of liver malignancies. Methods: 302 patients with 476 liver malignancies were treated with established protocol and adjuvant measures and subjected to efficiency analysis. In the 302 patients, 181 had 282 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) with a mean diameter of 4. 2 cm, and 121 had 194 metastatic liver carcinomas (MLC) with a mean diameter of 3.9 cm. According to UICC-TNM system 50 patients (27.6%) were in stage I/II and 131 (72.4%) in stage III/IV (including 39 patients with recurrent HCC after surgical resection). A standard protocol and an individualized protocol were used to treat the tumors based on their size, shape and special location such as the distance from diaphragm, gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract. Needle placement method and operation skill for the tumor region adjacent to important structures were described. Some adjuvant measures such as supplementary fine needle localization, local saline injection and feeding vessel ablation were used to improve RFA efficacy in tumors with different features. Local ablation of bleeding site and haemostatic administration systemically were adopted to deal with bleeding. For the patients with tumor adjacent to gastrointestinal tract, prolonged fasting after the RFA procedure was required, the patients were followed up regularly to assess the treatment efficiency, and the tumor was considered complete necrosed if no viability was found on enhanced CT or enhanced US one month after RFA. Results: The tumor necrosis rate was 95.7% (270/282 tumors) for HCC, 94.8% (184/194 tumors) for MLC, 91.1% (51/56 tumors) for tumor near gastrointestinal tract, 88. 5% (69/78 tumors) for tumors near diaphragm, and 94.3% (49/52 tumors) for tumor near gallbladder. The local recurrence rate was 10.3% (29/282 tumors) for HCC and 14.4% (28/194 tumors) for MLC. The 1, 2 and 3 year overall survival rates were 87.6%, 67.4% and 58.6% in the HCC patients, and 87.4%, 48.2%, 25.3% in the MLC patients respectively. The 1, 2 and 3 year survival rates of 50 HCC patients in early (I-II) stages were 90.7%, 85.9% and 73.7%, respectively. The incidence of complications was 2.2% (13/583 sessions), including 5 cases of hemorrhage, 1 case colon perforation, 8 cases of injury of adjacent structures. Conclusion: Application of proper protocol and adjuvant measures plays an important role in improving tumor ablation rate. Knowledge about possible complications and their control may increase the treatment efficacy and help to promote the use of RFA technique.

0031906538	Esophageal varices: Evaluation with transabdominal US	PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the clinical usefulness of transabdominal ultrasound (US) in the detection of esophageal varices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transabdominal US was performed in 47 patients (30 men, 17 women; age range, 18-75 years) with liver cirrhosis or idiopathic portal hypertension. The intraabdominal esophagus was demonstrated satisfactorily, and the findings were correlated with the presence of esophageal varices at endoscopy and angiography. The thickness of the anterior wall of the intraabdominal esophagus was measured and the irregularity of the wall surface documented. Blood flow sinal in the esophageal wall also was evaluated with color Doppler and pulsed Doppler examinations. RESULTS: The mean thickness of the esophageal wall was 5.7 mm ± 1.7 (standard deviation) in patients with esophageal varices and 3.6 mm ± 0.96 in patients without varices. This difference was statistically significant (P < .001). Varices also caused irregular wall surfaces. Another specific finding was hepatofugal venous flow within the esophageal wall at Doppler examination. When an esophageal was thickness of at least 5 mm or an irregular wall surface was used as a diagnostic criterion for esophageal varices, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93%, 82%, and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Transabdominal US can play a role in screening for esophageal varices. The intraabdominal esophagus should be observed during standard abdominal US in patients with chronic liver disease.

24744464627	Prognostic factors on outcome of radiofrequency ablation of 172 primary hepatic tumors	Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors affecting outcome in Radiofrequency (RF) ablation of primary hepatic tumors by univariate and multivariate analyses, and to assess the therapeutic efficacy of Radio-frequency ablation. Methods: A total of 172 patients with primary hepatic tumors underwent RF treatment in our department between 1999 and 2004. Among them, 150 patients were not the surgery candidates. The follow-up period ranged from 4 to 51 months and follow-up rate was 94.8% (163 patients). Kaplan-Meier model and log-rank test were used in univariate analyses and COX regression model was used in multivariate analyses, to identify prognostic factors for survival. Results: The survival rates at half a year, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year were 91.5%, 77.4%, 55.7% and 51.2% respectively. Using univariate analyses, 24 potential factors were analyzed and 8 of them were found significant for survival. These 8 factors were Child-Pugh grade, UICC stage, AFP value before first RF, Portal hypertension, first treatment or treatment for recurrence, pathological grade, treatment purpose and method, ablative safe margin. For 116 patients who underwent RF when first diagnosis, the survival rates in patients with different tumor stage (UICC standard of hepatocellular carcinoma) at half a year, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year were estimated as follows: 96.7%, 92.3%, 81.6% and 65.3% in 33 patients of stage I-II; 91.2%, 76.3%, 56.6% and 51.4% in 83 patients of stage III-IV; There was significant difference in survival rates between patients of stage I-II and patients of stage III-IV. For 56 patients suffered from recurrent hepatic tumors, the survival rates at half a year, 1 year, 2 year and 3 year were 88.5%, 70.2%, 41.4% and 24.5%, being similar to those of stage III-IV. The 8 factors mentioned above were further analyzed by multivariate model and 3 of them were identified as prognostic factors for survival. These 3 factors included Child-Pugh grade, Portal hypertension, treatment purpose and method. Conclusion: Based on our statistical analysis, the prognostic factors on outcome in Radio-frequency ablation of hepatic tumors were grouped into two categories. Child-Pugh grade, and Portal hypertension were the characteristics of patients and uncontrollable. While treatment purpose and method also had significant impact on survival and was controllable during RF procedure. This information might be useful to improve treatment level of Radio-frequency ablation of hepatic tumors.

27744531608	Intraperitoneal hemorrhage during and after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of hepatic tumors: Reasons and management	Background: Introperitoneal hemorrhage is one of the most common complications of radiofrequency (RF) ablation of hepatic tumors. This study was designed to investigate the reason and management of intraperitoneal hemorrhage occurred during or after percutaneous RF ablation of hepatic tumors. Methods: Three hundred and fifty-six patients with hepatic tumors have been treated at 592 procedures of ultrasound guided RF ablation. Intraperitoneal hemorrhage occurred in 5 patients (0.8%). The reasons and management of intraperitoneal hemorrhage in these 5 cases were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Two patients with liver metastasis and one hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient suffered from hemorrhage during the RF treatment. Two patients with recurrent HCC after surgery developed hemorrhage 20 minutes or 4 hours after RF treatment. One case of hemorrhage was due to the inappropriate electrode positioning induced liver laceration while treating a 1 cm liver metastasis near the liver capsule. One was due to the injury of a small vessel by the RF needle in another liver metastasis patient. Three cases were due to tumor rupture with two cases induced by cough or position change after treating large protruding HCC lesions. Four (80%) of the 5 cases of hemorrhage were rapidly identified by ultrasound. The causes and sites of bleeding during the RF treatment in three cases were confirmed through ultrasound, which were successfully treated using RF coagulation to achieve hemostasis of the bleeding site. Two patients with post-ablation hemorrhage recovered in one hour and 24 hours, respectively after given blood transfusion and other conservative measures. No surgical intervention was required. Two patients died of wide spread metastasis 23 - 36 months afterwards and the other three patients have lived for 18 - 25 months to date. Conclusions: It is important to perform close monitoring during and after RF ablation in order to identify intraperitoneal hemorrhage in time. RF ablation of the bleeding sites was a simple and effective management when the bleeding site could be confirmed by ultrasound. The hemorrhage due to the rupture of large and protruding liver tumors could be serious and should be considered as contraindication for RF treatment.

2942724313	Large liver tumors: Protocol for radiofrequency ablation and its clinical application in 110 patients - Mathematic model, overlapping mode, and electrode placement process	PURPOSE: To establish a preoperative protocol for ultrasonographically guided percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation of large liver tumors that is based on mathematic models and clinical experience and to evaluate the role of this protocol in RF ablation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A regular prism and a regular polyhedron model were used to develop a preoperative protocol for liver tumor ablation. This protocol enabled the authors to minimize the number of ablation spheres, optimize the overlapping mode, and determine the electrode placement process. One hundred ten patients with 121 liver tumors were treated by using this protocol. Sixty-nine patients had 74 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and 41 had 47 metastases to the liver (ie, metastatic liver carcinomas [MLCs]). Patients underwent follow-up helical computed tomography (CT) 1 month and every 2-3 months after RF ablation. Ablation was considered a success if no contrast enhancement was detected in the treated area on the CT scan obtained at 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 536 ablations were performed in the 121 tumors. The ablation success rate was 87.6% (106 of 121 tumors); the local recurrence rate, 24.0% (29 of 121 tumors); and the estimated mean recurrence-free survival, 17.1 months. Twenty-five patients underwent 38 re-treatments for local tumor recurrence. Major complications occurred in seven patients. Of these patients, only one, who had a tumor close to the colon, had a colon perforation 1 week after RF and required surgical intervention. CONCLUSION: The described protocol for treatment of large tumors had a success rate of 87.6% and a local recurrence rate of 24.0%. © RSNA, 2004.

29544436876	Treatment efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of 338 patients with hepatic malignant tumor and the relevant complications	Aim: To investigate the treatment efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatic malignant tumor and the relevant complications. Methods: A total of 338 patients with 763 hepatic tumors underwent ultrasound-guided RFA (565 procedures). There were 204 cases of hepatic cellular carcinoma (HCC) with 430 tumors, the mean largest diameter was 4.0 cm. Of them, 48 patients (23.5%) were in stages I-II (UICC Systems) and 156 (76.5%) in stages III-IV There were 134 cases of metastatic liver carcinoma (MLC), with 333 metastases in the liver, the mean diameter was 4.1 cm, the liver metastases of 96 patients (71.6%) came from gastrointestinal tract. Ninety-three percent of the 338 patients were treated using the relatively standard protocol. Crucial attention must be paid to monitor the abnormal changes in ultrasound images as well as the vital signs of the patients to find the possible hemorrhage and peripheral structures injury in time. The tumors were considered as ablated completely, if no viability was found on enhanced CT within 24 h or at 1 mo after RFA. These patients were followed up for 3-57 mo. Results: The ablation success rate was 93.3% (401/430 tumors) for HCC and was 96.7% (322/333 tumors) for MLC. The local recurrence rate for HCC and MLC was 7.9% (34/430 tumors) and 10.5% (35/333 tumors), respectively. A total of 137 patients (40.5%) underwent 2-11 times of repeated ablations because of tumor recurrence or metastasis. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year survival rate was 84.6%, 66.6%, and 63.1%, respectively; the survival rate from 48 patients of I-II stage HCC was 93.7%, 80.4%, and 80.4%, respectively. The major complication rate in this study was 2.5% (14 of 565 procedures), which consisted of 5 hemorrhages, 1 colon perforation, 5 injuries of adjacent structures, 2 bile leakages, and 1 skin burn. Conclusion: RFA, as a minimally invasive local treatment, has become an effective and relatively safe alternative for the patients of hepatic malignant tumor, even of advanced liver tumor, tumor recurrence, and liver metastases. Knowledge about possible complications and their control may increase the treatment efficacy and help to promote the use of RFA technique. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

30444436172	Application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in selecting indication of radiofrequency ablation among hepatocellular carcinoma patients	Objective: To evaluate the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in selection of the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) indicated to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods: 164 patients with HCC, 121 males and 43 females, aged 52.4 (38 - 72), who asked for RFA were randomly divided into 2 groups: 81 patients undergoing CEUS before RFA (CEUS Group), and 83 patients not undergoing CEUS before RFA (Control Group). There were not significant differences in the TNM staging, liver function Child-Pugh classing, and average tumor size between the 2 groups. Follow-up by conventional ultrasonography, enhanced CT and/or enhanced ultrasonography was conducted for 6 - 36 months. Results: Nine of the 81 patients in CEUS Group (11.8%) were determined by CEUS as unsuitable for RFA; 5 of the 9 patients had more than 5 lesions, 2 of the 9 patients had lesions >8 cm in diameter, and the tumor had invaded 2 large vessels or intestine in 2 of the 9 patients. The other 72 patients in CEUS Group, with 101 lesions, underwent RFA after CEUS. CEUS discovered 12 lesions ≤1.7 cm that had not been discovered by conventional ultrasonography and CT in 8 patients, 3 of which were patients with cirrhosis undergoing follow-up, and 2 of which were HCC patients undergoing follow-up after treatment. Of these 8 patients, 3 had 7 newly discovered satellite lesions around the main lesions. The successful rates of CEUS Group and Control Group were 95.0% and 89.6% respectively (P>0.05). The distant recurrence rate of Control Group was 22.9%, significantly higher than that of CEUS Group (9.7%, P<0.05). Conclusion: Helping find minute tumors, CEUS is useful in selecting HCC patients suitable for RFA, thus decreasing the intrahepatic recurrence after RFA.

31144475499	Application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound to increase the diagnostic rate of liver tumor by biopsy	Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in percutaneous liver biopsy of focal liver lesions. Methods: Two hundred and eleven patients with unidentified space occupying lesions in liver, 112 males and 74 females, aged 52 (16-78), were randomly divided into 2 groups: CEUS group in which 96 cases with 149 lesions underwent liver biopsy with 21-18 gauge needles directed by real time grey CEUS, and routine ultrasound (US) group in which 115 patients with 153 lesions underwent biopsy guided by conventional ultrasonography. There was no significant difference in the size of lesions between these 2 groups. There were 75 minute malignant lesions with the size of ≤2.0 cm (24.8%) in 67 patients, 12.9% in the CEUS group and 11.9% in the US group. Obtainment of adequate specimen for pathological examination meant successful biopsy. Definite diagnosis was made by the combination of the results of pathological examination, CEUS, CT, MRI, angiography, serum alpha-fetoprotein, and 3 to 6-month follow-up. Results: The proportion of no more than 2 puncture attempts in the CEUS group was 33/19, significantly higher than that in the US group (8/153, P=0.0007). The biopsy success rate of the CEUS group was 98.7%, significantly higher than that of the US group (91.5%, P=0.0096). The accurate diagnosis rate of the CEUS group was 96.0%, significantly higher than that of the US group (87.6% P=0.0165). The accurate diagnosis rate of malignant lesions with the size of ≤2.0 cm in the CEUS group was 97.4%, significantly higher than that in the US group (80.6%, P=0.0473). Among the 112 confirmed malignant lesions in the US group 15 had been diagnosed as benign by pathological examination of the biopsy specimens with a false negative rate of 13.4%. The relevant patients underwent CEUS-guided biopsy again and 14 of the 15 lesions were confirmed as malignant finally and the size of 6 of the 14 lesions was ≤2.0 cm. Except for one case of pneumothorax in the US group no major complication occurred. Conclusion: Biopsy guided by CEUS is more accurate in location and diagnosis of malignant lesions and minute tumors in the liver, thus increasing the success rate of biopsy and the confirmed diagnosis rate of malignant lesions.

33645086429	The perspective studies on changes of quality of life for patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma before and after radiofrequency ablation on	Objective: To determine the changes of the quality of life (QOL) in patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) before and after radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and to analyze the preoperative self-assessment and the relationship between the QOL scores and the disease-free survival. Methods: A time-point inquiry was conducted in 31 consecutive HCC patients using a Chinese QOL questionnaire for HCC (QOL-LC V2.0). The difference of diseased-free survival between the high and low baseline QOL group was analyzed. Results: Physical domain score and global QOL score increased after RFA and were higher than the pre-therapy level at the second and third month. The symptom or side effect domain score improved at the second assessment point and remained constant between the second and the third assessment point. Psychological domain score increased at the second assessment point, but deteriorated at the third assessment point, however, was still higher than the level before RFA. Self-rating score followed a similar pattern with that of psychological domain. The disease-free survival was higher in patients with a preoperative physical domain score of 45 or more than in patient with a preoperative physical domain score of 45 or less. Similarly, The disease-free survival was higher in patients with a preoperative self-rating score of 70 or more than in patient with a preoperative physical domain score of 70 or less. Conclusions: Within 1 to 3 months after RFA therapy, the scores of QOL and body function domain present a rising tendency, but the self-assessment and the mental status descend at the 3rd month, the patients, whose score of body function before therapy is equal to or less than 45 and the self-assessment score is equal to or less than 70, also the patients, whose post-treatment scores of self-assessment descend, should be vigilant to the possibility of recurrence or neoplasm.

33645634087	Changes of peripheral-blood dendritic cells in normal rat treated by radiofrequency ablation	Objective: To study the change of peripheral blood dendritic cells (DC) in normal rat treated by radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods: Twelve healthy SD rats were separated into RFA group with 6 rats and control group with 6 rats. Peripheral blood was taken out respectively before and 1w after RFA. The number and the phenotype of dendritic cells in peripheral blood were analyzed with flow-cytometry. Results: Pathological examination after RFA showed the characteristic that coagulation necrosis and cellular degeneration and granulation tissue forming appeared from target center to peripheral of the target. (0.34±0.08)% of normal rat mononuclear cells in peripheral blood express OX-62, the ratio became (0.70±0.16)% after 1 week of RFA. The difference between two groups was significant. (18.20±9.40)% and (37.57±12.24)% of normal rat DC in peripheral blood respectively express OX-6 and CD86, the ratio became respectively (19.63±5.94)% and (46.38±9.67)% after 1 week of RFA. The difference between two groups was not significant. Conclusion: RFA can make the number of peripheral blood precursor DC increasing, which may be contribute to improve the ability delivery of body to antigen to a certain extent.

33745498415	Evaluation of primary malignancies of the liver using contrast-enhanced sonography: Correlation with pathology	OBJECTIVE. Our purpose was to investigate the correlation of contrast-enhanced sonographic patterns with the histopathology of primary malignancies of the liver. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Of the 318 contrast-enhanced sonographic examinations performed between April and September 2004, 95 patients with 117 lesions confirmed by surgery or biopsy pathology were reviewed in this study. We analyzed the enhancement time and patterns according to the types and degrees of pathologic differentiation. RESULTS. All 65 moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) enhanced in the arterial phase, and 96.9% (63 lesions) of them quickly washed out in the portal venous phase. All 32 well-differentiated HCCs enhanced in the arterial phase, and 50.0% (16 lesions) washed out slowly during the late phase. The washout time of the two differentiated types was significantly different (p < 0.05). Seventy-five percent of the clear cell carcinomas (12/16) enhanced in the arterial phase, 25% (4/16) did not enhance until the portal venous phase, and 31.3% (5/16) of the clear cell carcinomas washed out slowly during the late phase. The enhancement and washout times of clear cell carcinomas were significantly different than those of moderately to poorly differentiated HCCs (p < 0.05). All four intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas presented the same patterns as moderately to poorly differentiated HCCs: enhanced in the arterial phase and quickly washed out in the portal venous phase. Among the 72 lesions enhanced homogeneously, 46 lesions (63.9%) were smaller than 3 cm. Thirty-seven lesions (82.2%) of the 45 lesions that enhanced heterogeneously were larger than 3 cm (including the four cholangiocarcinomas). Larger lesions were mainly less differentiated. There were significant differences in tumor sizes in regard to cellular differentiations and types. CONCLUSION. Our study showed that the enhancement manifestations of primary malignancies of the liver are related to pathologic types and grades. Contrast-enhanced sonograms may provide the histopathologic information for malignant tumors of the liver. © American Roentgen Ray Society.

33746172027	Effect of radiofrequency ablation of normal rat liver on IL-10 in peripheral-blood and local area of liver	Objective: To study the effect of radiofrequency ablation of normal rat liver on IL-10 in peripheral-blood and local area of liver. Methods: Thirty healthy SD rats were randomly separated into group 1 week after RFA, group 2 weeks after RFA and control group; there were ten rats in each group. Peripheral blood and liver tissue around the local area of control group, group 1 week after RFA and group 2 weeks after RFA were taken out respectively without RFA, 1 week and 2 weeks after RFA. The mononuclear cells of peripheral blood and liver tissue were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The expression level of IL-10 in peripheral blood and liver tissue were analyzed with flowcytometry. Results: The expression level of IL-10 in peripheral blood of control group was 94.8333 ± 3.5388, and that of group 1 week and 2 weeks after RFA were respectively 88.96 ± 5.7230 and 63.08 ± 13.7723. The difference between control group and group 2 weeks after RFA was marked. The expression level of IL-10 in liver tissue of control group was 94.9333 ± 2.0817, and that of local area around RFA focus of group 1 week and 2 weeks after RFA were respectively 93.3400 ± 2.1652 and 72.9400 ± 10.4677. The difference between control group and group 2 weeks after RFA was marked. Conclusion: RFA can reduce the expression level of IL-10 in peripheral-blood together with local area of normal rat liver and may decrease inhibitory action of IL-10 on differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells to a certain extent.

33746496262	The role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound on the diagnosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma (≤3 cm) in patients with cirrhosis	Background: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) (≤3 cm) in patient with cirrhosis. Materials and methods: Fifty-seven cases with 64 small HCC tumors (≤3 cm) were analyzed in this study. In these cases, all patients had liver cirrhosis and surgical or biopsy histopathological diagnosis. Diagnosis of baseline ultrasound (US) and CEUS of each lesion was made separately using a 5-point scoring system based on the US and CEUS characteristics of the lesions and was compared with histopathological results. Results: All of the 47 moderately to poorly differentiated (MD-PD) HCC presented the "fast-in and fast-out" (FIFO) pattern with fast enhancement within 25 s and then a quick wash-out within 90 s after contrast injection. Ten of 17 well-differentiated (WD) HCC (58.8%) had "fast-in and slow-out" (FISO) pattern which washed out after 90 s and 1 WD HCC had "fast-in and no-out" (FINO) pattern which did not wash out till 360 s. Three well differentiated clear cell carcinomas smaller than 1.5 cm showed "slow-in and slow-out" (SISO) pattern which enhanced after 25 s and washed out after 90 s. On baseline US, only 36 lesions (56.3%) were diagnosed as definitely or possibly malignant lesions. After CEUS, 50 lesions (78.1%) with "FIFO" pattern were diagnosed as definitely malignant, while 15.6% (10 lesions) with "FISO" pattern as possibly malignant, only 4 lesions (6.3%) with "FINO" or "SISO" pattern could not be diagnosed by CEUS. Conclusion: The typical enhancement patterns of "FIFO" or "FISO" of small HCC could improve the diagnostic ability of ultrasound in cirrhotic liver. Small HCC also had atypical enhancement patterns including "FINO" and "SISO". It shows that CEUS could be a useful imaging modality in small HCC diagnosis. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

33748679782	Treatment strategy to optimize radiofrequency ablation for liver malignancies	PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to investigate a treatment strategy to increase liver tumor necrosis and minimize complications with ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency (RF) ablation and to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 332 patients with 503 liver malignancies underwent RF ablation according to a mathematical protocol with adjunctive measures. In the 332 patients, 205 had 308 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with a mean largest diameter of 4.1 cm and 127 had 195 metastatic liver carcinomas (MLCs) with a mean largest diameter of 3.9 cm. In patients with HCC, 60 (29.3%) had stage I/II disease and 145 (70.7%) had stage III/IV disease. Depending on tumor size, shape, and location, a defined treatment strategy was adopted that consisted of a mathematical protocol, an individualized protocol, and adjunctive measures. The mathematical protocol was followed for tumors larger than 3.5 cm. The individualized protocol was used for tumors located adjacent to the diaphragm, gastrointestinal tract, or gallbladder. Some adjunctive measures such as supplementary fine needle localization, local saline solution injection, and feeding vessel ablation were used to deal with different features of these liver tumors. Patients were followed regularly to assess treatment efficiency, and the tumor was considered to have early complete necrosis if no viability was found on enhanced computed tomography 1 month after RF ablation. RESULTS: In this series, the early necrosis rates were 95.8% for HCC (295 of 308 tumors), 94.9% for MLC (185 of 195 tumors), 91.3% for tumors larger than 3.5 cm (189 of 207 tumors), 90.7% for tumors near the gastrointestinal tract (49 of 54 tumors), 91.5% for tumors near the diaphragm (86 of 94 tumors), and 90.6% for tumors near the gallbladder (48 of 53 tumors). The local recurrence rates were 10.7% for HCC (33 of 308 tumors) and 14.9% for MLC (29 of 195 tumors). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival rates were 89.6%, 69.4%, and 59.6%, respectively, for HCC and 80.3%, 52.8%, and 30.9%, respectively, for MLC. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates in 60 patients with stage I/II HCC were 93.7%, 87.1%, and 76.2%, respectively. The incidence of major complications was 1.4% (eight of 574 sessions), which included of three hemorrhages, four injuries to adjacent structures, and one case of needle tract seeding. CONCLUSION: In RF ablation of hepatic tumors, application of a proper protocol and adjunctive measures play important roles in improving tumor necrosis rate and minimizing potential complications. © SIR, 2006.

33748475177	The role of contrast-enhanced sonography of focal liver lesions before percutaneous biopsy	OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the clinical utility of performing contrast-enhanced sonography before percutaneous biopsy of focal liver lesions. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. One hundred eighty-six patients with focal liver lesions detected on either sonography or contrast-enhanced CT were randomly divided into two groups: a group who underwent contrast-enhanced sonography and another who underwent unenhanced sonography. The contrast-enhanced sonography group (79 patients, 129 lesions) underwent SonoVue-enhanced sonography before biopsy, and the unenhanced sonography group (107 patients, 143 lesions) did not undergo contrast-enhanced sonography before biopsy. Conventional sonography was used in all patients to guide the biopsy procedures. The pathologic diagnosis was considered definitive and final if the biopsy result was malignant. If the initial biopsy result was benign or negative for malignancy, then the result was either confirmed or denied on the basis of contrast-enhanced CT, MRI, angiography, serum α-fetoprotein level, or clinical follow-up over a period of 6 months. In some patients with suspected malignancy, biopsy was repeated when considered necessary during the follow-up. The diagnostic accuracy of the initial biopsy was defined as the percentage of the total number of lesions that were correctly diagnosed at the initial biopsy. The difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two groups was analyzed to evaluate the value of performing contrast-enhanced sonography before biopsy. RESULTS. Of the 129 lesions in the contrast-enhanced sonography group, 28 (21.7%) were benign and 101 (78.3%) were malignant. Of the 143 lesions in the unenhanced sonography group, 36 (25.2%) were benign and 107 (74.8%) were malignant. There was no significant difference in the distribution of malignant and benign lesions in these two groups (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of lesions by size between the contrast-enhanced and unenhanced sonography groups (χ

33847344366	Identification the invasion range of hepatocellular carcinoma by contrast-enhanced ultrasound	Objective: To study the histopathologic characteristics of the enlarged enhancement area of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) during the arterial or portal phase and evaluate the value of CEUS in identifying the invasion range of HCC. Methods: Fifty-two patients with fifty-two lesions confirmed as HCC pathologically (41 by surgery and 11 by needle biopsy) were included. The lesion size, margin and shape at fundamental ultrasonography (US) and CEUS were compared before surgery or needle biopsy. Lesions with a larger enhancement area and/or a more irregular shape during the arterial or portal phase at CEUS were classified as group A; lesions with unchanged size and shape were classified as group B. The tissues specimens of the tumor margin (peripheral tumor tissues) were obtained and the slides were stained with HE and CD34 immunohistochemistry, the histopathology and microvessels density (MVD) of group A and B were compared. Results: In group A, 75% (24/32 lesions) had vaguely demarcated margin at US compared with 40% (8/20 lesions) in Group B (P < 0.05). The largest average diameter of Group A was 6.1 ± 2.9 cm compared with 4.4 ± 2.1cm in group B (P < 0.05). Of the 41 surgically resected HCC specimens, 88% of the 75 slides for the 25 lesions in Group A demonstrated cancer cells invasion in the peripheral tumor, much higher than the 56.3% (27/48 slides) of the 16 lesions in Group B (P < 0.001). The MVD in Group A by CD34 immunohistochemistry was significant higher than that in Group B (52.25 vs 36.82, P < 0.01). Conclusion: The enlarged enhancement area of HCC at CEUS correlated with the sharpness of tumor margins. The cancer cells invasion and more microvessels generation in the enlarged enhancement area reflected the histopathologic characteristics of invasive growth pattern of HCC. CEUS helpful in identifying the actual tumor size and invasion range, and might be helpful for HCC treatment.

33847623796	Quality of life after radiofrequency ablation combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma: Comparison with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization alone	Objective: Comprehensive studies are scarce with regard to the quality of life (QOL) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and/or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of TACE alone and that of the TACE followed by RFA (TACE-RFA) on QOL in HCC patients. Methods: QOL was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) (Version 4.0) questionnaire, translated into Chinese, as a measure of QOL among Chinese HCC patients. Prospectively, 83 patients in both TACE group (n = 40) and TACE-RFA group (n = 43) completed the questionnaire at baseline and 3 months after treatment, respectively. Results: The TACE-RFA group resulted in a significantly higher total QOL score, socio-family well-being score, and functional well-being score than that of TACE group, 3 months after respective treatment. Liver function, tumor recurrence and complication, age, income were the most important factors affecting the QOL of HCC patients after treatment. The logistic regression analyses showed that Child-Pugh Class and tumor recurrence after treatment were independent predictors of post-treatment QOL scores of HCC patients. Conclusions: The overall QOL of HCC patients in TACE-RFA group was maintained at a relatively higher level than that of TACE group. TACE followed by RFA appeared to be more favorable than TACE alone with respect to QOL. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

34447312478	Focal liver lesions: Can SonoVue-enhanced ultrasound be used to differentiate malignant from benign lesions?	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with SonoVue could differentiate malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) from benign lesions and provide lesion type diagnoses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six patients with 554 FLLs were examined by CEUS with SonoVue using low mechanical index, nonlinear imaging techniques. Each lesion was characterized by 2 independent off-site readers as malignant or benign and given specific lesion type diagnosis, if possible, both at baseline ultrasound (US) and after SonoVue administration (CEUS). The final diagnosis was achieved by histopathology obtained from biopsy or surgical specimens, or by typical manifestation on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracies of the 2 readers were 41.9% and 35.2% for baseline US, which improved significantly to 87.2% and 87.9% for CEUS (P < 0.05). Interreader agreement also increased with CEUS compared with baseline US (ê value changed from 0.49 to 0.77). The accuracy for lesion type diagnosis was 38.4% and 32.5% for baseline US, which increased to 77.6% and 78.0% for CEUS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CEUS with SonoVue improves differentiation between malignant and benign FLLs, and also provides improved lesion type (differential) diagnosis. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34347237285	The role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in planning treatment protocols for hepatocellular carcinoma before radiofrequency ablation	Aim: To evaluate the clinical value of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in identifying the tumour number, ablation range and feeding vessels before ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and to compare the efficacy of RFA after CEUS with the efficacy of RFA after non-enhanced ultrasonography (US) without contrast medium administration. Materials and methods: From 2002 to 2005, 81 patients with 110 HCCs underwent CEUS with SonoVue before RFA treatment (group A). Eighty six patients with 112 HCCs who underwent US without contrast enhancement before RFA served as the control group (group B). The average diameters of the lesions in group A and group B were 3.6 ± 1.1 cm and 3.5 ± 1.1 cm, respectively. There were no significant differences in clinical data between the two groups. Regular follow-up after treatment was performed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). After treatment, complete necrosis was defined as the absence of viable tissue in treated tumours at the 1-year follow-up CECT. Results: Using CEUS an additional seven small lesions (≤2.0 cm) were found compared with those found using CECT and conventional US. CEUS showed that 56.4% of lesions (62/110 tumours) were larger in size and 49.1% (54/110 tumours) became more irregular in shape during the arterial phase than on conventional US. Feeding vessels were detected using CEUS in 52 (91.2%) of 57 lesions that were larger than 3.5 cm. The follow-up period was at least 1 year for each case. The complete tumour necrosis rate in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (92.2% versus 83.0%; p = 0.036). Conclusion: CEUS can be used to more accurately define the size and contour of lesions, and to detect additional small or satellite lesions and the feeding vessel of HCC tumours. CEUS provided important information for designing the ablation protocol, and might improve the efficacy of RFA. © 2007 The Royal College of Radiologists.

34547689002	The use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in the selection of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for radio frequency ablation therapy	Objective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in selecting patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for radio frequency ablation (RFA). Methods. One hundred seventy-nine patients with HCC were divided into 2 groups before receiving RFA: a CEUS group and a control group. The patients were concatenated and alternately apportioned into these 2 groups. In the CEUS group, 92 patients underwent pre-RFA CEUS using the contrast agent sulfur hexafluoride and enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging before RFA for selecting suitable cases for RFA, and in the control group, conventional ultrasonography and enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were performed in 87 patients for selecting patients. Results. In the CEUS group, 9 patients (9.8%) were excluded for RFA therapy by CEUS. The other 83 patients (90.2%), with a total of 114 lesions, were treated by RFA. In the control group, 5 patients (5.7%) were excluded for RFA. The other 82 patients (94.3%), with a total of 107 lesions, were treated by RFA. During the follow-up period of 18 to 50 months, the primary technique effectiveness rates in the CEUS and control groups were 94.7% and 87.9%, respectively (P = .1182). The local tumor progression rate, the new HCC rate, and the repeated RFA rate of the CEUS group were significantly lower than those of the control group (P = .033, .004, and .001, respectively). Conclusions. Pre-RFA CEUS provides important information for selecting suitable patients for RFA. The use of CEUS in selecting patients with HCC can decrease post-RFA local tumor progression and improve the efficacy of RFA therapy. © 2007 by the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine.

38849115642	Diagnosis of small hepatic nodules detected by surveillance ultrasound in patients with cirrhosis: Comparison between contrast-enhanced ultrasound and contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography	Aim: To investigate the diagnostic value for the diagnosis of small (1-2cm) hepatic nodules detected by surveillance ultrasound in patients with cirrhosis using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) compared with that of contrast-enhanced helical computed tomography (CECT). Methods: Seventy-two liver cirrhosis patients with 103 small hepatic nodules (1-2cm) detected by surveillance ultrasound were enrolled in the present study. All patients underwent CEUS with SonoVue as well as CECT. Nodules which appeared by contrast enhancement during the arterial phase and contrast wash-out during the late phase on CEUS or CECT were diagnosed as malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). Histopathology obtained from biopsy or surgery served as the gold standard. Results: According to the above diagnostic criteria, the sensitivity (i.e. rate of correct diagnosis of HCC) was 91.1% (51/56 HCC) for CEUS and the specificity (i.e. the rate of correct exclusion of HCC) was 87.2% (41/47 regenerative nodules [RN]).Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS was 89.3% (92/103 all nodules). Using the same diagnostic criteria, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CECT were 80.4% (45/56 HCC), 97.9% (46/47 RN), and 88.4% (91/103 all nodules). Overall, there was no significant difference between CEUS and CECT in the diagnostic confidence of small hepatic nodules. Eighty-six nodules (45 HCC and 41 RN) were correctly diagnosed by both modalities and six (five HCC and one RN) were misdiagnosed by both. Conclusion: The ability of CEUS in the characterization of small nodules (1-2 cm) detected by surveillance US in patients with liver cirrhosis is similar to that of CECT. © 2007 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

33644853906	High mechanical index post-contrast ultrasonography improves tissue structural display of hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: The advent of second generation agent-SonoVue and low mechanical index real-time contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) imaging have been shown to improve the diagnostic performance of ultrasonography in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). But no report has described the effect of high mechanical index (MI) post-CEUS. This study aimed to investigate the value of post-CEUS in displaying tissue structures of HCC. Methods: Seventy-six HCCs in 65 patients were included in the study. Each patient underwent three scans, high-MI (MI: 0.15-1.6) pre-contrast ultrasound, low-MI (MI: 0.04-0.08) CEUS with contrast agent SonoVue, and high-MI post-contrast ultrasound, which was performed within 3 minutes after CEUS. The size, boundary, echogenicity, internal echotexture and posterior acoustic enhancement of the HCCs in the conventional scans before and after CEUS were evaluated. According to pathological evidence, diagnosis rates of pre-contrast, CEUS and post-contrast scans were determined and compared. The potential mechanism of post-contrast ultrasound imaging was also discussed. Results: Compared with pre-contrast, post-contrast ultrasound showed improvement in image quality in most HCCs: twenty-six (34.2%) more lesions showed well defined margins and fourteen (18.4%) more nodules showed halo sign; twenty-three (30.3%) lesions demonstrated enlarged in sizes; changes in echogenicity were seen in 30 lesions (39.5%); eighteen (23.7%) more lesions showed heterogenecity and 20 (26.3%) more lesions showed "mosaic" or "nodule-in-nodule" sign; twelve (15.8%) more lesions showed posterior acoustic enhancement. Post-contrast ultrasound showed increased diagnostic accuracy of 93.4% (71/76), compare with 88.2% (67/76) of CEUS alone. Conclusions: High-MI post-contrast ultrasound utilizes harmonic signals during the rupture of microbubbles, and significantly improves the display of echo-characteristics of HCCs in ultrasound images, which adds diagnostic values for CEUS. Post-contrast ultrasound could play an important role in tissue characterization, and may be included in CEUS protocols. © 2005-2008 Chinese Medical Journal, All Rights Reserved.

33344473605	Overall survival and disease-free survival of radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors affecting overall survival and free-disease survival in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A total of 182 HCC patients underwent RFA treatment in our department and were enrolled into this study. The average tumor size was (3.9±1.2) cm (range 1.2-8.0 cm). Ninety-seven of the 182 HCC patients had Child-Pugh class cirrhosis A; 76, class B; and 9, class C. According to TNM system, 53 patients were at stage I - II, 70 at stage III and 59 at stage IV, respectively. A total of 22 factors, which potentially affected the outcome, were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier model and log-rank test were used in univariate analysis and COX regression model was used in multivariate analyses, to identify prognostic factors for survival. Results: The mean overall survival and disease-free survival were (45.5±2.3) months and (24.9±2.1) months, respectively. The significant factors in univariate analysis were further analyzed by multivariate model and the following factors were identified as prognostic factor for survival. (1) Overall survival: daughter lesion, Child-Pugh classification, TNM stage. (2) Disease-free survival: tumor number, daughter lesion, Child-Pugh classification, standard treatment protocol, combination with TACE. Among these, Child-Pugh classification was the most risk factors for two kinds of survivals. Conclusion: Based on our statistical analysis, careful imaging examination, protection of liver function and application of proper treatment strategy and adjuvant therapy might benefit the survival.

34249031577	Differential diagnosis of non-functional islet cell tumor and pancreatic carcinoma with sonography	Objective: To investigate the differential diagnosis of non-functional islet cell tumor (NFICT) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pancreatic carcinoma) with clinical presentation and sonographic features. Materials and methods: Twenty cases of NFICT were investigated in the study, and 41 cases of pancreatic carcinoma were included as the control group. Among them, 5 NFICT and 32 pancreatic carcinomas underwent CEUS with SonoVue. Clinical presentation and sonographic characteristics were evaluated with Logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the preliminary result of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was analyzed. Results: Statistic analysis showed four significant factors in differential diagnosis for NFICT and pancreatic carcinoma, including age (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.006), tumor margin (P < 0.001) and vascularity of tumor (P = 0.004). Combined these four factors, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 95.0%, 95.1% and 95.1%, respectively. When the patient is younger than 60 years, and tumor is smaller than 5 cm with well-defined margin and hypervascular, it would be most likely a NFICT other than pancreatic carcinoma. NFICT often shows early enhancement and more homogeneous infusion than pancreatic carcinoma on CEUS (P = 0.005 and 0.008). Conclusions: Sonography is able to provide useful differential information for NFICT, which is often misdiagnosed as pancreatic carcinoma. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

40849102634	A tailored approach to radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma and its outcome	Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a tailored approach to radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA was performed in 274 tumors of 228 patients located at liver periphery, including 59 near the bowel, 115 near the diaphragm, 54 near the gallbladder, and 46 near the liver surface. The tumor sizes ranged 1.2-7.0 cm [ mean (3. 7 ± 1. 2) cm ]. A tailored treatment strategy was established for tumors in different locations. Contrast-enhanced CT was performed one month later to evaluate the early necrosis rate of the treated tumors. Results: Early tumor necrosis rate was 91.6% of the peripherally located HCC, including 91.5% of the tumors near the bowel, 90.4% near the diaphragm, 92.6% near the gallbladder, and 93.5% near the liver surface. Local tumor recurrence rates were 8.5%, 9.6%, 7.4%, and 6.5% for tumors near the bowel, diaphragm, gallbladder, and liver surface, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rate of this group were 82.3%, 62.9%, and 53.7%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 3.3% of the treatment sessions, including haemorrhage (n = 2), nearby structure injury (n = 6), and needle tract seeding (n = 4). Conclusion: The tailored approach to RFA provides a promising treatment option for refractory peripherally located HCC with satisfactory tumor necrosis rate and low complication rate.

84925365673	Image-guided tumorablation: Standardization ofterminology and reporting criteria-A 10-year update	Image-guided tumor ablation has become a well-established hallmark of local cancer therapy. The breadth of options available in this growing field increases the need for standardization of terminology and reporting criteria to facilitate effective communication of ideas and appropriate comparison among treatments that use different technologies, such as chemical (eg, ethanol or acetic acid) ablation, thermal therapies (eg, radiofrequency, laser, microwave, focused ultrasound, and cryoablation) and newer ablative modalities such as irreversible electroporation. This updated consensus document provides a framework that will facilitate the clearest communication among investigators regarding ablative technologies. An appropriate vehicle is proposed for reporting the various aspects of image-guided ablation therapy including classification of therapies, procedure terms, descriptors of imaging guidance, and terminology for imaging and pathologic findings. Methods are addressed for standardizing reporting of technique, follow-up, complications, and clinical results. As noted in the original document from 2003, adherence to the recommendations will improve the precision of communications in this field, leading to more accurate comparison of technologies and results, and ultimately to improved patient outcomes.

44049093888	Radiofrequency ablation of problematically located hepatocellular carcinoma: Tailored approach	Background: The challenge for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in problematic locations is that the outcome is limited due to insufficient ablation or injury of nearby structures. This study aimed to evaluate effective strategy and treatment results of RFA in these cases. Methods: Ultrasound guided percutaneous RFA was performed in 326 HCC patients. Among them, 249 tumors in 215 patients located at liver periphery, including 54 adjacent to GI tract, 110 close to the diaphragm, 49 close to the gallbladder, and 36 tumors close to liver surface. The sizes of the tumors ranged 1.2-7.0 cm (average 3.7 ± 1.3 cm). Individualized treatment strategy was established for tumors in various locations, including "artificial ascites", "lift-expand" electrode placement, "draw-expand" electrode placement, "Supplementary ablation", and "accumulative multiple ablations" techniques. Treatment outcome was compared with another 64 central-located tumors (control group) in the same patients. One-month post-RFA contrast CT was used to evaluate early necrosis rate of the treated tumors. Results: Early tumor necrosis were obtained in 91.6% (228/249) of the problematically located HCC, including 90.7% (49/54) of the tumors adjacent to GI tract, 90.9% (100/110) near the diaphragm, 91.8% (45/49) by the gallbladder, and 94.4% (34/36) close to liver surface. The necrosis rate of control group was 98.4% (63/64), which was higher than the tumors close to diaphragm (P = 0.049). Local tumor recurrence was 8.4% (21/249), comparing with 3.1% (2/64) of the control group (P > 0.05). The 1-, 2- and 3-year survival rate of this group were 81.6%, 63.8%, and 53.6%, respectively. Major complications occurred in 3.2% (11/343) of the treatment sessions, including hemorrhage in two, nearby structure injury in five, and needle tract seeding in four patients. Conclusions: Individualized treatment strategy for problematically located HCC is helpful in improving RFA outcome and expanding the application range of the therapy. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

46749121016	Radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma: Long-term outcome and prognostic factors	Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the prognostic factors for post-RFA survival rate. Methods: From 1999 to 2006, 266 patients with 392 HCCs underwent ultrasound guided RFA treatment. They were 216 males and 50 females, average age 59.4 ± 15.4 years (24-87 years). The HCC were 1.2-6.7 cm in diameters (average 3.9 + 1.3 cm). There were 158 patients with single tumor, and the rest had multiple (2-5) tumors. Univariate and multivariate analysis with 19 potential variables were examined to identify prognostic factors for post-RFA survival rate. Results: The overall post-RFA survival rates at 1st, 3rd, and 5th year were 82.9%, 57.9% and 42.9%, respectively. In the 60 patients with stage I HCC (AJCC staging), the 1-, 3-, 5-year survival rate were 94.8%, 76.4% and 71.6%, significantly higher than the 148 patients with stage II-IV tumors (81.8%, 57.6% and 41.2%, P = 0.006). For the 58 patients with post-surgery recurrent HCC, the survival rates were 73.2%, 41.9% and 38.2% at the 1st, 3rd, and 5th year, which were significantly lower than those of stage I HCC (P = 0.005). Nine potential factors were found with significant effects on survival rate, and they were number of tumors, location of tumors, pre-RFA liver function enzymes, Child-Pugh classification, AJCC staging, primary or recurrent HCC, tumor pathological grading, using mathematical protocol in RFA procedure and tumor necrosis 1 month after RFA. After multivariate analysis, three factors were identified as independent prognostic factors for survival rate, and they were Child-Pugh classification, AJCC staging and using mathematical protocol. Conclusion: Identifying prognostic factors provides important information for HCC patient management before, during and after RFA. This long-term follow-up study on a large group of HCC patients confirmed that RFA could not only achieve favorable outcome on stage I HCC, but also be an effective therapy for stage II-IV or recurrent HCC. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

52649166318	Feasibility of improving radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma by percutaneously blocking tumor-feeding vessels	Objective: To explore the feasibility and outcome of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in blocking feeding vessels of hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Totally 101 patients pathologically confirmed hypervascular HCC were included in the study. In percutaneous arterial ablation (PAA) + RFA group, 71 patients with 74 HCC underwent PAA before classical RFA of the other regions of the tumors, while in the RFA group, another 83 patients with 102 HCC were treated with RFA directly. For another 30 patients who responded poorly to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization were treated with percutaneous arterial embolization (PAE), followed by RFA; another 23 patients were treated with RFA alone were regarded as the control group. Contrast-enhanced CT and magnetic resonance imaging were used as post-RFA imaging follow-up at 1, 3, and 6 month. Results: In PAA + RFA group, post-PAA imaging showed blocked blood flow in 65 (87.8%) HCC. There were average 2.76 ± 1.12 ablated foci per HCC in PAA + RFA group and 3.36 ± 1.60 ablated foci per HCC in control group (P = 0.01). The tumor necrosis rate at 1 month after RFA was 90.5% (67/74) in PAA + RFA group and 90.2% (92/102) in control group. HCC recurrence rate at 6 month after RFA was 17.6% (13/74) in PAA + RFA group and 31.4% (32/102) in control group (P = 0.038). In PAE + RFA group, 88.6% of the main feeding vessels were blocked. The tumor necrosis rate at 1 and 6 month after FRA was 92.6% (25/27) and 85.2% (23/ 27) in PAA + RFA group and 65.2% (15/23) (P = 0.030) and 56.5% (13/23) (P = 0.024) in control group. Conclusion: PAA and PAE can block the feeding vessels of HCC, enhance the ablated necrosis in the tumor, decrease post-RFA recurrence, and therefore provides a safe and feasible method for treating hypervascular HCC.

Methods: A total of 154 HCC patients with 177 pathologically confirmed hypervascular lesions participated in the study and were randomly assigned into two groups. Seventy-one patients with 75 HCCs (average tumor size, 4.3 ± 1.1 cm) were included in group A, in which the feeding artery of HCC was identified by color Doppler flow imaging, and were ablated with multiple small overlapping RFA foci [percutaneous ablation of feeding artery (PAA)] before routine RFA treatment of the tumor. Eighty-three patients with 102 HCC (average tumor size, 4.1 ± 1.0 cm) were included in group B, in which the tumors were treated routinely with RFA. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography was used as post-RFA imaging, when patients were followed-up for 1, 3 and 6 mo. Results: In group A, feeding arteries were blocked in 66 (88%) HCC lesions, and the size of arteries decreased in nine (12%). The average number of punctures per HCC was 2.76 ± 1.12 in group A, and 3.36 ± 1.60 in group B (P = 0.01). The tumor necrosis rate at 1 mo post-RFA was 90.67% (68/75 lesions) in group A and 90.20% (92/102 lesions) in group B. HCC recurrence rate at 6 mo post-RFA was 17.33% (13/75) in group A and 31.37% (32/102) in group B (P = 0.04). Conclusion: PAA blocked effectively the feeding artery of HCC. Combination of PAA and RFA significantly decreased post-RFA recurrence and provided an alternative treatment for hypervascular HCC. © 2009 The WJG Press and Baishideng. All rights reserved.

69749100626	Effects of radiofrequency ablation on OX62, OX6 and CD86 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the rat liver	BACKROUND: Previous studies have confirmed that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has not only efficiently killed tumor cells, but also improved immune suppression of organism. Antigen presenting cells play an important role during anti-tumor immune reaction. Dendritic cells are most powerful antigen presenting cells. OBJECTIVE: To study the influence of RFA on OX-62, OX-6 and CD86 expression of rat peripheral blood mononuclear cells. DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: The randomized controlled animal observation was performed at the School of Oncology of Peking University from June 2005 to March 2006. MATERIALS: A total of 12 Sprague Dawley rats were equally and randomly assigned into control and 1-week radiofrequency groups. METHODS: 2 mL peripheral blood was extracted from rats of the control group following rats were sacrificed. The left lobe of rat liver was exposed, inserted with acicular electrodes at tilted position. The acicular electrodes were spread out. The action time was 4 minutes. After RFA, the rats were given anti-infective therapy. 2 mL peripheral blood was taken out after they were put to death 1 week after RFA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The following parameters were measured: pathomorphological observation on the liver of normal rats after RFA; OX-62, OX-6 and CD86 expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after RFA. RESULTS: Pathologyical examination after RFA showed the characteristic that coagulation necrosis and cellular degeneration and granulation tissue forming appeared from target center to peripheral of the target. Positive expression rate of OX-62 in rat peripheral blood in the 1-week radiofrequency group [(0.70±0.16)%] was significantly higher than in the control group [(0.34±0.08)%, P < 0.05]. No significant difference in positive expression rate of OX-6 and CD86 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells between both groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: RFA can promote the increased number of precursor Dendritic cells in rat peripheral blood, which may be contributed to improve the ability to angtigen presentation during immune response.

69249212586	Combination therapy of radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatectomy compared with single treatment	Aim: To assess the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy and to compare its outcome with a single modality. Method: We retrospectively studied 103 patients with recurrent HCCs after hepatectomy who were excluded from repeat hepatectomy. Of them, 81 patients were male and 22 were female (mean age 55.8 ± 10.7 years; range, 30-80 years). According to treatment modality, these patients were divided into three groups: RFA was used as the sole first-line anticancer treatment in 37 patients (RFA group); TACE was used as the sole first-line anticancer treatment in 35 patients (TACE group). RFA followed by TACE was performed in 31 patients (combination group). There was no significant difference in clinical material between the three groups. Indices including treatment success rate, intrahepatic recurrence rate and survival were obtained for analysis and comparison. Results: The treatment success rate of the combination group was significantly higher than that of the TACE group (93.5 vs. 68.6%, P = 0.011). The intrahepatic recurrence rate of the combination group was significantly lower than that of the TACE group (20.7 vs 57.1%, P = 0.002) and the RFA group (20.7 vs 43.2%, P = 0.036). The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 73.9, 51.1 and 28.0% respectively in the RFA group; 65.8, 38.9 and 19.5% respectively in the TACE group; and 88.5, 64.6 and 44.3% respectively in the combination group. There was a significant difference in survival between the combination group and the TACE group (P = 0.028). Conclusion: RFA combined with TACE was more effective in treating recurrent HCC after hepatectomy compared to single RFA or TACE treatment. This combination therapy can thus be a valuable choice of treatment for recurrent HCC. © 2009 The Japan Society of Hepatology.

77956098580	Efficacy and feasibility of radiofrequency ablation for decompensated cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: Most HCC patients with decompensation of liver function lost the chance of surgical and/or interventional treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and outcome of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with poor liver function (Child-Pugh class C), who are not suitable for surgery or hepatic artery chemo-embolization. Methods: Thirteen HCC patients (the number of tumors was 17) with liver function of Child-Pugh C (scores: 10.2±0.4) were included in the study. Among the patients, 8 were male and 5 were female with the average age of (61.6±10.9) years old. The average size of HCC was (3.8±1.0) cm. Two patients were recurrent HCC and 30.8% of the patients had multiple tumors (2-3 tumors). All the patients were treated with RFA. Results: There were 22 RFA sessions (1-4 sessions per patient) in all, average ablations per tumor at first session was 3.1. One week after RFA, the liver enzymes elevated in 9 patients (69.2%), in 7 of them, the liver enzyme returned to pre-RFA level in 1-3 months. One month after RFA, the Child-Pugh grading was 10.3±0.8 (Child-Pugh C), while that of pre-RFA was 10.2±0.4 (Child-Pugh C), with no significant difference. Computer tomography (CT) one month after RFA showed that the tumor necrosis rate was 88.2% (15/17). Five patients had 2-4 repeated RFA due to HCC recurrence. During the follow-up of 2-69 months in this group, survival rate of one year was 53.8%, two years was 30.8%, and three year was 15.4%. The incidence of RFA-related complications was 13.6% (3/22 sessions), including 1 case of GI hemorrhage and 1 sub-capsular hemorrhage of the liver. One patient with HCC over 5 cm who had fever and liver abscess after RFA, and was dead 2 months later due to liver function failure. Conclusions: Minimal invasive RFA provides possible treatment modality for HCC patients with poor liver function, who are not candidates for surgical and/or interventional therapy. For large HCC, due to the required extended treatment region, special attention should be paid to the possibility of acute liver failure.

79960035681	Intrahepatic biliary injuries associated with radiofrequency ablation of hepatic malignancies	Background Biliary injury after radiofrequency ablation can cause serious consequences including death. However, there are limited data regarding bile duct changes with or without complications associated with radiofrequency ablation of hepatic malignancies. This study aimed to assess the incidence, prognosis and risk factors of intrahepatic biliary injury associated with radiofrequency ablation. Methods Between June 2001 and January 2009, 638 patients with hepatic malignancies (405 with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 233 with liver metastasis) who had 955 treatment sessions were enrolled in this study. Imaging and laboratory data, the course of treatment, and patient outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. The risk factors of biliary injury and the impact on overall survival of patients were analyzed. The chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier curves and stepwise Logistic regression model were used for statistical analysis where appropriate. Results Biliary injury was observed in 17 patients after 17 ablation sessions based on imaging findings. The overall incidence of biliary injury was 1.8% (17/955) with an average onset time of 12 weeks (2-36 weeks). Mild, moderate and severe complications of biliary injury were identified in 9, 6 and 2 cases, respectively. The median survival time after detection of biliary injury was 40 months. There seemed no notable difference in overall survival between patients with and those without biliary injuries. By multivariate analysis, vessel infiltration (P=0.034) and treatment session ≥4 times (P=0.025) were independent risk factors for biliary injury of hepatocellular carcinoma; while tumor located centrally was the only independent risk factor in the metastasis group (P=0.043). Conclusions The incidence of biliary injury was not frequent (1.8%). Through appropriate treatment, intrahepatic bile duct injuries seemed not affect the patients' long-term survival. Additionally, risk factors may be helpful for selecting radiofrequency ablation candidates and predicting biliary complications.

84860231101	Radiofrequency ablation in the management of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma	Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency (RF) ablation for treatment of unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and to explore the impact of prognostic variables on outcomes. Materials and Methods: From 2000-2010, 17 patients with 26 ICCs underwent RF ablation at a single institution. None of the patients were surgery candidates. Seven patients had 15 primary ICCs, and 10 patients had 11 recurrent ICCs. The median largest diameter was 4.4 cm (range 2.1-6.8 cm). A percutaneous approach was used in 15 patients, and an open approach was used in 2 patients. Early tumor necrosis, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate 12 clinicopathologic and treatment-related variables associated with recurrence-free survival and overall survival. Results: Early tumor necrosis was 96.2% (25 of 26 tumors). The median follow-up period after RF ablation was 29 months. The median recurrence-free survival and overall survival were 17 months and 33 months. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates were 84.6%, 43.3%, and 28.9%, with an overall complication rate of 3.6% (1 of 28 sessions). Three variables were found to be closely associated with recurrence-free survival: lymph node metastases (P =.023), tumor differentiation (P =.034), and tumor number (P =.035). The only variable significantly associated with overall survival was tumor differentiation (P =.033). Conclusions: Preliminary results showed that RF ablation may be an effective treatment for ICC because it achieved an acceptable survival rate in a small population. Prognostic factors might allow better patient selection and outcomes. © 2012 SIR.

84863016522	Radiofrequency ablation for postoperative recurrences of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma	Objective: Most recurrent intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (RICC) lost the opportunity of radical resection while most nonsurgical management failed to prolong patients' survival. The efficacy and safety of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a local treatment for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma have been confirmed by many clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, long-term survival and complications of RFA for RICC. Methods: A total of 12 patients with 19 RICCs after radical resection were included in this study. The tumors were 1.9-6.8 cm at the maximum diameter (median, 3.2±1.6 cm). All patients were treated with ultrasound guided RFA. There were two RFA approaches including percutaneous and open. Results: A total of 18 RFA treatment sessions were performed. Ablation was successful (evaluated by 1-month CT after the initial RFA procedure) in 18 (94.7%) of 19 tumors. By a median follow-up period of 29.9 months after RFA, 5 patients received repeated RFA because of intrahepatic lesion recurrence. The median local recurrence-free survival period and median event-free survival period after RFA were 21.0 months and 13.0 months, respectively. The median overall survival was 30 months, and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were 87.5% and 37.5%, respectively. The complication rate was 5.6% (1/18 sessions). The only one major complication was pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis. Conclusion: This study showed RFA may effectively and safely manage RICC with 3-year survival of 37.5%. It provides a treatment option for these RICC patients who lost chance for surgery. © Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.

84863699488	Role of contrast enhanced ultrasound in radiofrequency ablation of metastatic liver carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the application of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in planning and guiding for radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for metastatic liver carcinoma (MLC). Methods: One hundred and thirty-five patients with clinically and pathologically diagnosed MLC (from gastrointestinal tumors) were included in the present study, and 104 of them had received CEUS prior to RFA to assess the number, size, shape, infiltration, location and enhancing features of the lesions. Among the 104 patients, 21 (20.1%) were excluded from RFA treatment due to too many lesions or large infiltrative range based on CEUS. The remaining 83 patients with 147 lesions underwent RFA (group A). During the same period, other 31 patients with 102 lesions serving as control group were treated based on findings of conventional ultrasound without contrast (group B). The patients underwent follow-up enhanced CT at the 1st month, and then every 3-6 months after RFA. The tumor was considered as early necrosis if no contrast enhancement was detected in the treated area on the CT scan at the 1st month. Results: In group A, 72 of 147 MLC lesions (48.9%) showed increased sizes on CEUS. Among them, 48 lesions (66.6%) appeared enlarged in arterial phase, and 24 (33.3%) showed enlarged hypoechoic area in parenchymal phase. CEUS showed total 61 additional lesions in 35 patients (42.1%) (ranged from 8 to 15 mm) compared with conventional ultrasound (US), and 42 (68.8%) of them were visualized in parenchymal phase only. There were total 208 lesions in group A underwent RFA with CEUS planning, and the tumor necrosis rate was 94.2% (196/208). In this group, local recurrence was found in 16 lesions (7.7%) during 3-42 months' following up, and new metastases were seen in 30 cases (36.1%). For group B, the tumor necrosis rate was 86.3% (88/102), local recurrence in 17 lesions (16.7%), and new metastases in 13 cases (41.9%). Tumor early necrosis and recurrence rates were significantly different between the two groups (P=0.018, P=0.016, respectively). Conclusion: CEUS played an important role in RFA for liver metastases by candidate selecting and therapy planning, which helped to improve the outcome of the treatment. © 2012 Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84865056702	The detection rate of perirectal lymph nodes of rectal carcinoma with transrectal ultrasonography	Objective: To conclude the preoperative detection rate of perirectal lymph nodes with transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and to analyzed factors affecting the detection rate and the correlation between the size and metastasis of the lymph nodes. Methods: Preoperative TRUS was conducted for 45 patients with rectal carcinoma and the size and number of the lymph nodes detected By ultrasonic inspection were recorded. The postoperative sonography was performed again for the surgical specimens. All the results were compared with pathologic findings. Neither radiotherapy nor chemotherapy was conducted preoperatively in the cases studied. Results: A total of 698 lymph nodes were detected by pathological examinations. In comparison with the pathological findings, the overall preoperative detection rate of the perirectal lymph nodes by the TRUS was 22.5%, among which the detection rate of lymph nodes of less than 5 mm in maximum diameter (L) by TRUS was 12.6%, the detection rate of the lymph nodes with the diameter size of larger than or equal to 5 mm and less than 10 mm amounted to 42.4%, and that with the size of larger or equal to 10 mm was 67.9%. The detection rate of TRUS for the perirectal lymph nodes was relatively low as tumor was found at the superior segment of rectum or causing an obvious stenosis of enteric cavity, with 12.1% and 10.3%, respectively. The pathological findings showed that the incidence rate of lymphatic metastasis in the lymph nodes with less than 5 mm was 13.2%, the incidence of metastasis in the lymph nodes with 5 to 10 mm amounted to 30.7% and that in the lymph nodes with larger than or equal to 10 mm was 64.3%. Conclusion: The detection rate of perirectal lymph node with TRUS is low. The following factors may affect the detection rate of lymph nodes with TRUS: size of lymph node, rectal stenosis, tumor location and atypical ultrasonogram. Check failure of the lymph nodes decreases the accuracy of TRUS in the assessment of perirectal lymph node metastasis.

84868288628	Effect and prognostic analysis of radiofrequency ablation in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma	Objective: To evaluate the effect of ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to analyze the prognostic factors. Methods: A total of 90 patients with unresectablely advanced HCC underwent percuatenous RFA therapy between July 2000 and June 2011 were enrolled into the study. According to the 6th UICC/AJCC-TNM system, 80 and 10 patients were in stage III and IV, respectively. 78 patients were men and 12 patients were women. Ages ranged from 24 to 87 years old (mean ± SD, 59 ± 12 years). The tumor size ranged from 1.5 to 8.0 cm (mean ± SD, 4.5 ± 1.4 cm). The maximum tumor of 73 patients (81.1%) was larger than 3.0 cm. 31 patients (34.4%) had 2-4 tumors. The Child-Pugh classification of B and C were 32 patients (35.6%) altogether. By regular follow-up, enhanced CT combined with AFP was used to evaluate the effect after RFA. Kaplan-Meier model and Log-rank test were used in univariate analysis and Cox regression model was used in multivariate analysis to identify prognostic factors for survival. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant difference. Results: Complete tumor necrosis rate after initial RFA was 90.9% (120/132 tumors). Serious complications were developed in two patients (2.2%) and no treatment-related death occurred. 3-129 months were followed up. Local recurrence rate was 15.2% (20/132 tumors). The 1-, 3-, 5-year overall survival rates were 83.3%, 48.3%, 21.9%, respectively, and the median survival time was 35 months. The univariate analyses showed that patients with Child-Pugh classification of A, tumor less than 3.0 cm, applying CEUS, using standard treatment protocols, achieving complete tumor necrosis and without tumor recurrence survived longer (P < 0.05). Child-Pugh classification and the standard treatment protocols were identified as independent prognostic factors for survival by multivariate model (P=0.001, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Paying attention to the following factors of CEUS, standard treatment protocols, initially complete tumor necrosis and liver protection therapy for patients with advanced HCC is helpful to improve the patients' survival.

84871797619	Guidelines and Good Clinical Practice Recommendations for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) in the Liver - Update 2012. A WFUMB-EFSUMB Initiative in Cooperation with Representatives of AFSUMB, AIUM, ASUM, FLAUS and ICUS	Initially, a set of guidelines for the use of ultrasound contrast agents was published in 2004 dealing only with liver applications. A second edition of the guidelines in 2008 reflected changes in the available contrast agents and updated the guidelines for the liver, as well as implementing some non-liver applications. Time has moved on, and the need for international guidelines on the use of CEUS in the liver has become apparent. The present document describes the third iteration of recommendations for the hepatic use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using contrast specific imaging techniques. This joint WFUMB-EFSUMB initiative has implicated experts from major leading ultrasound societies worldwide. These liver CEUS guidelines are simultaneously published in the official journals of both organizing federations (i.e., Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology for WFUMB and Ultraschall in der Medizin/European Journal of Ultrasound for EFSUMB). These guidelines and recommendations provide general advice on the use of all currently clinically available ultrasound contrast agents (UCA). They are intended to create standard protocols for the use and administration of UCA in liver applications on an international basis and improve the management of patients worldwide. © 2013 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

84871475942	Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with artificial hydrothorax for liver cancer in the hepatic dome	Objective: To assess the value of application of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with artificial hydrothorax for liver cancer in the hepatic dome. Methods: Thirty-two patients with 43 lesions of hepatic malignant tumors in the hepatic dome underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with artificial hydrothorax. Artificial hydrothorax was created by infusion of saline via an intrathoracically placed 14-G central venous catheter, which was ultrasound-guided percutaneously inserted before RFA, separating the right lung from the hepatic dome. The adverse reaction and therapeutic efficacy were also analyzed. Results: In the 32 patients with 43 lesions in the hepatic dome (4 tumors in segment IV, 21 tumors in segment VII and 18 tumors in segment VIII), 18 lesions of 14 patients were not observed by ultrasound before the operation. Thirty-two patients received the ultrasound-guided placement of intrathoracical catheter, and (1606.3 ± 485.9) ml (1000-2500 ml) saline solution was infused successfully. After obtaining an image of the whole tumor, 31 patients received percutaneous RFA therapy on schedule, and 22 patients received percutaneous transdiaphragmatic RFA therapy. One patient with 2 lesions gave up the treatment, because one of his tumors was not detectable by ultrasound. Diaphragmatic muscle hemorrhage was seen in two patients, subcutaneous edema in two patients, and pneumothorax in one patient. All the complications were cured, and no serious complications or related death occurred. 1-month follow-up with contrast-enhanced CT/MRI images showed that 29 patients had complete ablation, and the effective rate of this technique was 93.5% (29/31). Conclusions: Artificial hydrothorax helps us not only to visualize the whole tumor in the hepatic dome, but also offers a transdiaphragmatic route for therapy. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous RFA with artificial hydrothorax is a feasible, safe, and effective technique for treating liver cancer in the hepatic dome and worthy of being promoted.

84874294247	Quantitative diagnostic value of contrast enhanced ultrasound of liver fibrosis	Objective: To explore the quantitative diagnostic value of CEUS of liver fibrosis. Methods: Totally 145 patients underwent CEUS, including 118 patients with hepatitis history (liver fibrosis group) and 27 patients without chronic hepatitis history and clinical signs (control group). Liver samples were achieved with biopsy or operation. The arrival time and peak time of hepatic artery, hepatic vein, portal vein and liver parenchyma were observed by using time intensity curves, and the relationship of fibrosis stages and the perfusion times among each stage was investigated. Results: The arrival time and peak time of hepatic artery and the peak time of portal vein were not significantly different in different fibrosis stage. The arrival time of portal vein in S1-S4 was longer than SO (all P < 0.05). The arrival time of hepatic vein in S3 and S4 were significantly shorter than SO (both P < 0.05). The peak enhancement time of liver parenchyma in S4 was earlier than SO (P < 0.05). ROC analysis showed when the arrival time of hepatic vein ≥ 23 s, the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS in diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (S4) was 79.0% and 85.2%, for the peak time of liver parenchyma ≥ 27 s, the value of sensitivity and specificity was 55.6% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: CEUS has potential as non-invasive diagnostic modality for cirrhosis, and may be useful to diagnosis of pre-cirrhosis.

84877352118	Experimental study of radiofrequency ablation of liver in swine	Objective: To explore the feasibility and efficacy of multiple-radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in swine liver. Methods: One swine undergone percutaneous and intra-operative RFA for three times in succession (an interval of 5 days) guided by real-time ultrasound. Then 6 ablated lesions formed. The outcome of RFA and the change of tissues adjacent to ablated lesions (billiary, liver vascular and abdominal wall) were observed by trans-abdominal ultrasonography (US), contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), intra-operative ultrasound (IOUS) and contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT). Results: Bile duct dilatation was found beside primary porta hepatis on US, CT, IOUS after RFA. There was no thrombus in liver vein through the ablated lesion with electrodes parallel to primary porta hepatis. Two ablated lesions were incompletely fused together. Small thermal injury was observed on abdominal wall after an injection of saline into subcapsular gap. Subcapsular hepatic tissue around ablation lesion changed into coagulative necrosis from hyperemia with elapsing time. Carbonizing granule formed during RFA on the top of intro-operative radio-frequency electrode easily caused bleeding along the withdrawing passage. Gelfoam was helpful to stop bleeding during intro-operative RFA. Occluding blood flow into liver definitely enlarged ablated area with the same amount of RFA energy. Conclusion: Multiple-RFA is feasible and efficacious for patients with RFA indication. But the complications of RFA increase if the ablation areas are adjacent to such organs as bile duct, stomach, intestine and diaphragm, etc. Copyright © 2013 by the Chinese Medical Association.

84883794697	Role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases and efficacy evaluation	Objective: To retrospectively investigate the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with liver metastases and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of RFA assisted by CEUS. Methods: From May 2004 to September 2010, 136 patients with 219 liver metastatic lesions received CEUS examination 1 h before RFA (CEUS group), and other 126 patients with 216 lesions without CEUS examination in the earlier period were served as a historical control group. The mean tumor size was 3.2 cm and the mean tumor number was 1.6 in the CEUS group, while 3.4 cm and 1.7 in the control group, respectively (P>0.05). The clinical characteristics, recurrence results and survival outcomes were compared between two groups. Results: In the CEUS group, two isoechoic tumors were not demonstrated on unenhanced ultrasonography (US), and 63 (47%) of 134 tumors examined with CEUS were 0.3 cm larger than with unenhanced US. Furthermore, in 18.4% of 136 patients, additional 1-3 tumors were detected on CEUS. The CEUS group showed higher early tumor necrosis and lower intrahepatic recurrence than the control group. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate and the 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) rate in the CEUS group were 50.1% and 38.3%, in contrast to 25.3% and 19.3% in the control group, respectively (P=0.002 and P<0.001). Conclusions: CEUS provides important information for RFA treatment in patients with liver metastases and better therapeutic effect could be attained. © Chinese Journal of Cancer Research.

84885961640	Performance of imaging modalities in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis	Purpose: The recent guidelines published in 2011 suggest the use of only one imaging method for the final imaging diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. To evaluate the methods in the context of the available literature evidence, this systematic review aimed at assessing the relative performance of different imaging techniques currently used in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched from January 1996 to June 2011, with no language limitation. Eligible trials had to be conducted in patients with suspicion or diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma; compare at least two of the following imaging modalities: magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, ultrasound; have pathological findings as a reference standard. An analysis also including non-comparative studies was performed as a validation of the main comparison results. Results: Of 5,144 screened papers, 16 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria for the comparative analysis and 65 were eligible for the non-comparative analysis. The overall sensitivity and specificity derived by the pooled analysis were 0.78 and 0.77 for computed tomography, 0.84 and 0.84 for magnetic resonance imaging and 0.86 and 0.77 for ultrasound, respectively. In the pair-wise comparisons, ultrasound showed a statistically better specificity than magnetic resonance imaging (0.86 vs. 0.78; p = 0.014) and a statistically better sensitivity than computed tomography (0.88 vs. 0.78; p = 0.030). Conclusion: The present systematic review did not show an obvious superiority of one imaging method. Since their accuracy is not completely overlapping, the possibility of reaching better performance by combining methods should be considered in future prospective trials. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.

84904458646	The clinical application of contrast enhanced ultrasonography in radiofrequency ablation therapy for residual and recurrent hepatic neoplasms	Objective: To discuss the clinical application of contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment for residual and recurrent hepatic neoplasms. Methods: A total of 517 cases of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or hepatic metastases with residual or recurrent hepatic neoplasms after different kinds of treatment were treated with RFA. A total of 619 lesions were used as study subjects. The average size of the 290 lesions detected in 281 patients with recurrent HCC was (3.4 ± 1.5) cm. CEUS-guided RFA group included 150 cases (154 lesions in total), while conventional US-guided RFA group included 131 cases (136 lesions in total). A total of 329 lesions were detected in 236 cases with recurrent hepatic metastases, and the mean size of the lesions was (3.1 ± 1.3) cm, of which CEUS-guided RFA group included 152 cases (198 lesions in total) and conventional US-guided RFA group included 84 cases (131 lesions in total). Results: In recurrent HCC, the one-month tumor necrosis rate of CEUS group and conventional US group was 96.1% and 89.7% respectively (P = 0.032), and the local recurrence rate was 9.7% and 17.6% respectively (P = 0.049). The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. In recurrent hepatic metastases, the one-month tumor necrosis rate of CEUS group and conventional US group was 88.4% and 87.0% respectively (P = 0.712), and the local recurrence rate was 16.7% and 23.7% respectively (P = 0.117). No significant differences existed between the two groups. Conclusion: For the treatment of recurrent HCC, CEUS-guided radiofrequency ablation can effectively improve the early necrosis rate and decrease local recurrence rate.

84904462911	Ultrasound-guided hepatic tumor ablation: History, current situation and clinical issues	With the constant development of imaging-guided percutaneous tumor ablation technology, its safety and efficacy have been recognized by clinical physicians as well as by patients. It has played a more and more important role in the modem minimally-invasive treatment for liver tumors. However, great differences in technique level of operation, the experience of physician, the function of the equipment, and patient's condition exist between different medical units. The therapeutic efficacy, recurrence rate and complication rate are also quite different from one hospital to another. In order to resolve the problems mentioned above and to further improve the clinical efficacy and safety of ablation therapy, the establishment of an agreement on ablation indication, treatment strategy of standardization and individualization, and standardized operation procedure and technique in China is mandatory at present. Besides, to formulate the license policy, to improve knowledge compensation from multiple clinical disciplines and to pay great attention to treatment standardization, etc. all are important means in order to improve the overall efficacy of liver tumor ablation in our country.

84904469324	Application value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in managing liver metastases before percutaneous radiofrequency ablation treatment	Objective: To assess the value of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) before percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating patients with liver metastases. Methods: A total of 267 patients with 485 liver metastatic lesions were treated with percutaneous RFA in authors' department during the period from July 2001 to December 2012. Among them, 180 patients with 251 lesions received CEUS examination before RFA and based on CEUS findings the treatment scheme was made (CEUS group), and other 87 patients with 234 lesions without use of preoperative CEUS were used as control group. No significant differences in clinical data existed between the two groups (P< 0.05). Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, CEUS and laboratory tests were regularly employed to evaluate the clinical results after RFA therapy. Results: In CEUS group, 25.1% of the lesions (63/251) determined by CEUS were 3 mm larger than that determined by conventional US. 8.8% of the lesions (22/251) were more clear on CEUS findings. In addition, 41 new lesions were detected only on CEUS. No significant differences in early tumor necrosis rate existed between the two groups: 95.2% (239/251) vs. 92.7% (217/234)(P > 0.05). The local recurrence rate of CEUS group was lower than that of the control group: 12.4% (46/234) vs. 19.7% (31/251) (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the recurrence time existed between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: CEUS performed before RFA treatment for patients with liver metastases is very useful for accurately judging the size and number of the lesions, which is very helpful in making therapeutic scheme. Therefore, preoperative CEUS can significantly increase early tumor necrosis rate and decrease the local recurrence rate.

84904501795	Application of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography in improving the success rate of percutaneous biopsy for peripheral pulmonary lesions	Objective: To investigate the clinical application of contrast enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in performing percutaneous biopsy for peripheral lung lesions. Methods: A total of 132 patients with peripheral lung lesions underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous biopsy. Of the 132 patients, 72 received CEUS examinations before biopsy (CEUS group), and 60 received simple biopsy with no CEUS examination (control group). The ultrasonography imaging characteristics, the times of puncture biopsy, the diagnostic accuracy rate and the incidence of complications were recorded, and the results were compared between the two groups. The clinical value of CEUS in improving the success rate of percutaneous biopsy for peripheral pulmonary lesions was analyzed. Results: Necrosis (areas of echoless) was demonstrated in 44.4% of the patients (32/72) in CEUS group, while it was displayed in only 6.7% of the patients (4/60) in the control group. The demonstration rate of necrosis in CEUS group were statistically higher than that in the control group (P < 0.01). In CEUS group coexisting local pulmonary atelectasis was found in 12.5% of the patients (9/72), and the pulmonary lesion within the atelectasis could be clearly displayed. In the control group, local pulmonary atelectasis was demonstrated only in 1.7% of patients (1/60), the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The diagnostic accuracy rate of CEUS group and the control group was 95.8% (69/72) and 80% (48/60) respectively, the difference was significant (P < 0.01). The average number of punctures in CEUS group and the control group was (2.4 ± 0.6) and (2.6 ± 0.6) times respectively, the difference was not significant. The incidence of complications in CEUS group and the control group was 2.8% and 3.3% respectively, the difference was not significant. No severe complications occurred in both groups. Conclusion: CEUS examination that is carried out before percutaneous pulmonary biopsy can effectively demonstrate the inner structure of the lesion, thus the diagnosis can be correctly made. Therefore, CEUS is of great value in guiding percutaneous pulmonary biopsy.

84910084377	Prototype of biliary drug-eluting stent with photodynamic and chemotherapy using electrospinning	Background: The combination of biliary stent with photodynamic and chemotherapy seemed to be a beneficial palliative treatment of unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. However, by intravenous delivery to the target tumor the distribution of the drug had its limitations and caused serious side effect on non-target organs. Therefore, in this study, we are going to develop a localized eluting stent, named PDT-chemo stent, covered with gemcitabine (GEM) and hematoporphyrin (HP). Methods: The prototype of PDT-chemo stent was made through electrospinning and electrospraying dual-processes with an electrical charge to cover the stent with a drug-storing membrane from polymer liquid. The design of prototype used PU as the material of the backing layer, and PCL/PEG blends in different molar ratio of 9:1 and of 1:4 were used in two drug-storing layers with GEM and HP loaded respectively. Results: The optical microscopy revealed that the backing layer was formed in fine fibers from electrospinning, while drug-storing layers, attributed to the droplets from electrospraying process. The covered membrane, the morphology of which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), covered the stent surface homogeneously without crack appearances. The GEM had almost 100% of electrosprayed efficiency than 70% HP loaded on the covered membrane due to the different solubility of drug in PEG/PCL blends. Drug release study confirmed the two-phased drug release pattern by regulating in different molar ratio of PEG/PCL blends polymer. Conclusions: The result proves that the PDT-chemo stent is composed of a first burst-releasing phase from HP and a later slow-releasing phase from GEM eluting. This two-phase of drug eluting stent may provide a new prospect of localized and controlled release treatment for cholangiocarcinoma disease.
