In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic error performance of orthogonal space-time block codes over flat Nakagami-m fading channels. Both identical and non-identical m-distributions are considered. Based on the moment generation function (MGF) approach, the closed-form asymptotic symbol error probabilities over Nakagami-m fading channels are derived. Compared to the previous works in literature, our results are more accurate and more general. Simulation results are provided to verify our analytical results. © 2007 IEEE.

77954828867	Fast-group-decodable space-time block code	To make the implementation of high-rate space-time block code (STBC) realistic in practical systems, fast-decodable (FD) and group-decodable (GD) code structures have been separately introduced into STBC to reduce the sphere decoding complexity. However, no STBC has both the two code structures until now. In this paper, high-rate fast-group-decodable STBC (FGD-STBC, which has both FD and GD code structures) is proposed for the first time. We first derive the condition for FD code structure with the lowest sphere decoding complexity, then we prove that such FD code structure can be integrated with the GD-STBC for FGD-STBC construction. Analysis and simulation show that the proposed FGD-STBC has much lower decoding complexity and comparable performance with the existing FD-STBC.

84866683698	Reduced functional dependence graphs and their applications	Functional dependence graphs (FDG) are an important class of directed graph that capture the functional dependence relationship among a set of random variables. FDGs are frequently used in characterizing and calculating network coding capacity bounds. However, the order of an FDG is usually much larger than the original network and the complexity of computing bounds grows exponentially with the order of an FDG. In this paper, we introduce graph pre-processing techniques which deliver reduced FDGs. These reduced FDGs are obtained from the original FDG by removing nodes that are not "essential". We show that the reduced FDGs give the same capacity region/bounds obtained using original FDGs, but require much less computation. The application of reduced FDGs for algebraic formulation of scalar linear network coding is also discussed. ©2012 IEEE.

84877746449	CEO: Consistency of encoding and overhearing in network coding-aware routing	Network coding-aware routing attempts to find coding opportunities between an incoming flow and existing flows in wireless ad hoc networks. However, we find that a problem of most proposed coding-aware routing schemes is that they may misidentify the coding opportunities. Specifically, the opportunity misidentification may appear when a packet is about to be re-encoded. We call this the re-encoding problem. To solve this problem, we propose a principle called consistency of encoding and overhearing (CEO). By adhering to CEO, the encoding node is able to avoid misidentifying coding opportunities, thus ensuring the successful decoding of all encoded packets. In this letter, we first show the importance of CEO by analysis in a simple topology. Then, we introduce a distributed way to apply CEO to a coding-aware routing scheme, and show the improved network performance with CEO by simulation in different scenarios. © 2012 IEEE.

84877757590	Check node reliability-based scheduling for BP decoding of non-binary LDPC codes	Scheduling strategy is considered an important aspect of belief-propagation (BP) decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes because it affects the decoder's convergence rate, decoding complexity and error-correction performance. In this paper, we propose two new scheduling strategies for the BP decoding of non-binary LDPC (NB-LDPC) codes. Both the strategies are devised based on the concept of check node reliability and employ a heuristically defined threshold which can adapt to the communication channel variations. As the scheduling strategies only update a subset of the check nodes in each iteration, they result in reduced iteration cost. Furthermore, since the BP performs suboptimally for finite-length LDPC codes, especially for short-length LDPC codes, by enhancing the message propagation over the Tanner Graphs of short-length NB-LDPC codes, the new scheduling strategies can even improve the error-correction performances of BP decoding. Simulation results demonstrate that the new scheduling strategies provide good performance/complexity tradeoffs. © 1972-2012 IEEE.

The decision and mapping rule for symmetric and asymmetric cases are studied. The performance in terms of bit error rate for each case will be studied and analysed by computer simulation. Analytical and simulation results show that uplink asymmetry is the worst case; intra-phase asymmetry and unreliable uplink channels will more severely affect the performance degradation, which is caused by channel asymmetry. © 2013 IEEE.

We present a new jointly spatial loading and precoding strategy to select reasonably a group of users for each tone on each transmit antenna by maximizing signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR), Then we introduce vector perturbation precoding in order to cancel multi-users interference at transmitter and achieve the maximum capacity or the minimum BER. Compared with conventional channel inversion and regularization channel inversion method, our proposed method has demonstrated a better performance than other methods because of multi-users diversity gain. Moreover, the proposed method would not increase peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of systems. © 2006 IEEE.

Several in-band null subcarriers are allocated with designed complex value for tone reservation by balancing the peak amplitude of baseband complex signals and other discrete symbols. In this paper, analysis of PAPR reduction gain is given to prove that PAPR of WiMAX system can be significantly reduced through the tone reservation method. Furthermore, the worst-case scenario is analyzed for tone reservation and the searching method for lowest bound for PARP reduction is extended. Simulation results also demonstrate that the different gap between the peak and the second peak amplitude affects the efficiency of tone reservation. And our proposed calculation method provides a effective way to decide whether the transmitter should use tone reservation. Under the IEEE 802.16-2004 WirelessOFDM physical layer model, in the worst-case, the highest PAPR reduction gain can approach 6.02dB and the average PAPR reduction to 1.47dB by tone reservation method. © 2006 IEEE.

In this paper, we present rigorous error rate analysis of orthogonal space time block codes in Nakagami-m keyhole channels with arbitrary fading parameters. Using a moment-generation-function based approach, we provide the exact expressions of symbol error rate. Furthermore, the closed-form asymptotic expressions are derived, based on which one can easily quantify the diversity gain of the considered system with arbitrary m-fading parameters while existing methods in literature fail to do so.

A novel linear per user minimum mean square error (PU-MMSE) detection technique for DS-CDMA with frequency domain equalization (FDE) based on the MMSE criterion applied per user is presented. It is shown by computer simulation that PU-MMSE outperforms conventional per carrier (PC-) MMSE for DS-CDMA with FDE in frequency selective block fading channel. The performance of DS-CDMA with PU-MMSE FDE can be further promoted by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Comparing to MC-CDMA with PU-MMSE FDE, DS-CDMA with PU-MMSE FDE has no performance loss and has much lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

In this paper, the outage probability and error probability of orthogonal space-time block codes with m transmit and n receive antennas over keyhole fading channels are analyzed. Closed-form outage probability and symbol/bit error rate expressions are derived with M-ray phase-shift keying (M-PSK) and M-ray quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) signaling. It is found that the exact error probability expressions have two different forms for m = n and m \neq n, respectively. Furthermore, when m \neq n, approximate error rate expressions are derived at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas there are no asymptotic expressions for m = n.

70349176338	Multi-user SISO precoding based on generalized multi-unitary decomposition for single-carrier transmission in frequency selective channel	In this paper, we propose to exploit the richly scattered multi-path nature of a frequency selective channel to provide additional degrees of freedom for desigining effective precoding schemes for multi-user communications. We design the precoding matrix for multi-user communications based on the Generalized Multi-Unitary Decomposition (GMUD), where the channel matrix H is transformed into i r i H PR Q . An advantage of GMUD is that multiple pairs of unitary matrices i P and i Q can be obtained with one single Rr. Since the column of i Q can be used as the transmission beam of a particular user, multiple solutions of i Q provide a large selection of transmission beams, which can be exploited to achieve high degrees of orthogonality between the multipaths, as well as between the interfering users. Hence the proposed precoding technique based on GMUD achieves better performance than precoding based on singular value decomposition.

Based on the frequency domain oversampling (FDO) and minimum mean-square error (MMSE) principle, a novel linear per-user MMSE detector is proposed to approximately restore the orthogonality among the spreading sequences and suppress the MAI. Based on a discussion on the optimal MMSE detector, a low complexity diagonal MMSE detector is proposed with only a slight degradation in performance.

The performance improvement is presented for a partial response magnetic recording channel. Our simulations are based on an LDPC code from the class of finite-geometry LDPC codes.

It is shown that frequency diversity inherent in a frequency-selective fading channel can be extracted and exploited by the proposed FSFD-MMSE receiver. This diversity advantage outweighs the effect of intercarrier interference generated by frequency-domain oversampling, due largely to the MMSE receiver's interference suppression capability. Numerical results show that the FSFD-MMSE receiver outperforms the conventional MMSE receiver under both ideal and practical situations (i.e., with frequency offset, channel estimation errors, and even doubly selective channel fading). In addition, the FSFD-MMSE receiver only needs a fast Fourier transform size that is no larger than N + Q - 1 (N = number of data subcarriers, and Q = number of resolvable multipath components). © 2006 IEEE.

78649410639	Delay-tolerant cooperative diversity routing MANET	Some mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) such as inter-vehicle communications require a transmission scheme that is robust to mobility and asynchronous reception with low setup overhead. However, many existing cooperative MANETs have complex MAC protocol and high overhead. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design across the routing, MAC and PHY layers, called delay-tolerant cooperative diversity routing (DT-CDR) MANET, in which network nodes work cooperatively to enhance the robustness of routing through cooperative space-time transmission. We construct a delay-tolerant orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) that supports low-complexity symbolwise decoding in the PHY layer. Due to the delay-tolerant code, strict synchronism is no longer required, hence simple MAC protocol is possible. Performance comparisons between the proposed DT-CDR MANET and conventional routing MANETs show that our design can significantly improve the end-to-end robustness and achieve cooperative diversity. ©2010 IEEE.

78751667703	Effect of carrier frequency offset on single-carrier CDMA with frequency-domain equalization	Single-carrier code-division multiple access (SC-CDMA) with frequency-domain equalization (FDE) has attracted renewed interest in CDMA due to its lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and higher frequency diversity than orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), increased robustness to asynchronous multipath and multiuser interference than RAKE-based CDMA, and a reduced need for timing and frequency coordination than time-division multiple access, frequency-division multiple access, and OFDMA. However, existing studies on SC-CDMA are mostly conducted based on an optimistic assumption of perfect carrier frequency estimation; hence, the carrier frequency offset (CFO) effect on the performance of SC-CDMA has not adequately been addressed and is not well understood. In this paper, the system performance of SC-CDMA with FDE is evaluated in terms of the average bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) obtained through an analytical approach for downlink transmission over a frequency-selective fading channel. The results show that CFO gives rise to three effects: 1) a net phase rotation; 2) fading-like signal power reduction; and 3) intercode interferences (ICIs) due to the loss of code orthogonality. How the CFO-induced BER degradation varies with the number of active users, the number of virtual subcarriers, and constellation size is also investigated. We further show that, in practice, to prevent the BER performance from dramatically deteriorating, the residual CFO after synchronization should be kept within 5% of the virtual subcarrier spacing, irrespective of the constellation size. © 2010 IEEE.

Since group-decodable (quasi-orthogonal) code structure can reduce the decoding complexity, we present in this paper systematic methods to construct group-decodable high-rate STBC with full symbol-wise diversity gain for arbitrary transmit antenna number and code length. We show that the proposed group-decodable STBC can achieve high code rate that increases almost linearly with the transmit antenna number, and the slope of this near-linear dependence increases with the code length. Comparisons with existing low-rate and high-rate codes (such as orthogonal STBC and algebraic STBC) are conducted to show the decoding complexity reduction and good code performance achieved by the proposed codes. © 2006 IEEE.

These systems achieve low probability of intercept (LPI) and orthogonality simultaneously by using the pseudorandom (PR) sequences for generating the phase vector of the basic function. Conventionally, the PR phase vectors in TDCS and WDCS were generated by a maximal length binary PR sequence (m-sequence), which allows only a relatively small number of users in the systems. This paper reports a method to increase the user capacity of TDCS and WDCS by applying Gold sequence to generate the PR phase vector of the basic function. The increased user capacity of the systems based on Gold sequence is tabulated. Simulation results also demonstrate that by using Gold sequences for the PR phase generation, both TDCS and WDCS can provide a comparable interference avoiding capability with a larger user capacity, compared to those of the systems based on m-sequences in multiple access environments. © 2011 IEEE.

Different from the traditional communication system suppressing interference at the receiver, TDCS synthesizes an adaptive fundamental modulation waveform (FMW) in the transform domain which evades the interference regions at the transmitter. In this paper we investigate the system performance of the TDCS by exploiting M-ary cyclic shift keying (CSK) modulation. The numerical results show that the M-ary CSK based TDCS can provide low bit error rate (BER) in the presence of single tone interference. With the increase of the order M-ary, the system has significant BER improvements. Furthermore, the transmission bit rate and bandwidth efficiency are also increased by the M-ary CSK based TDCS.

In this paper, we introduce a new code property of STC called block-orthogonal property, which can be exploited by QR-decomposition-based decoders to achieve significant decoding complexity reduction without performance loss. We show that such complexity reduction principle can benefit the existing algebraic codes such as Perfect and DjABBA codes due to their inherent (but previously undiscovered) block-orthogonal property. In addition, we construct and optimize new full-rate block-orthogonal STC (BOSTC) that further maximize the QRDM complexity reduction potential. Simulation results of bit error rate (BER) performance against decoding complexity show that the new BOSTC outperforms all previously known codes as long as the QRDM decoder operates in reduced-complexity mode, and the code exhibits a desirable complexity saturation property. © 2011 IEEE.

In this scheme, only the desired user's spreading code and timing information are available to the receiver. The two-stage constant modulus algorithm (CMA)-based receiver proposed, implements an adaptive blind joint equalisation and multiuser detection without explicit channel estimation. The first stage of the algorithm can be seen as a linear combination of blind adaptive minimum output energy (MOE) detectors based on total data correlation matrix. In this study, the authors adopt a MOE detector based on interference correlation matrix instead of total data correlation matrix to improve the performance of the first-stage detector, thus achieving an improved two-stage CMA-based blind joint equalisation and multiuser detection algorithm. In addition, the convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm is analysed.

We first verified that the spectrum of transmitted OFDM signals processed by TR-NS method with a small number of null subcarriers do not violate the spectrum mask specified in ETSI standard. Furthermore, we explored that the gain from TR-NS method increase slightly with the number of null subcarriers, but the TR-NS method is efficient in certain extent in terms of both complementary cumulative probability function and total degradation. Additionally we found that an efficient PAPR [1] definitively exist for the proposed TR-NS method, where a lower predefined PAPR threshold can not promise a better peak-power reduction gain. It is worthy noting that this result differs from that of TR using arbitrary reserved tones in the literature. Finally, we compared proposed TR-NS method with clipping-like methods in terms of total degradation to show the effectiveness of the TR-NS method by simulation, in which nonlinearity distortion due to high-power amplifiers is introduced. © 2007 IEEE.

However, the schemes available suffer from unbalanced bit error rates (BERs) for bits «0» and »1». Therefore, in this letter we will address the optimal BER-balanced WED. Specifically, we incorporate the BER balance requirement into the WED formulation and obtain the optimal weighting vector by solving a nonlinear convex optimization problem. To bypass the computational complexity required by the convex optimization, we derive a simple but near-optimal weighting vector. Simulations illustrate that the proposed BER-balanced WED schemes can achieve almost the same BER performance as the maximum likelihood (ML) demodulator, which is optimal in terms of BER performance but produces unbalanced BERs for different bits. © 1997-2012 IEEE.

Capitalizing on the sparseness of random UWB signals in the basis of eigen-functions, we develop a new CS dictionary called eigen- dictionary. Coupled with this eigen-dictionary, an enhanced Bayesian learning procedure is proposed to reconstruct the sparse UWB signal from a small collection of random projection measurements. Furthermore, by utilizing a common sparsity profile inherent in UWB signals, the proposed Bayesian algorithm naturally lends itself to multi-task CS for simultaneously recovering multiple UWB signals. Since the statistical inter-relationships between different CS tasks are exploited, the multi-task (MT) Bayesian CS can efficiently improve the reconstruction accuracy and thus the performance of UWB communications.

The EMCS uses the pinning bits, which have the potential to lower the error floors of the outer low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, for both resynchronization and improving error-correction performance. Furthermore, the soft-input synchronization for the inner decoder and the joint iterative decoding between the inner decoder and the outer decoder is employed to further improve the overall performance of the new scheme. Simulations show that the proposed EMCS reduces the code rate loss as compared with the conventional marker code scheme and achieves a better tradeoff between the error performance and the decoding complexity. Therefore, the new scheme can reduce code rate loss and improve storage efficiency when it is used in bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) systems. © 1965-2012 IEEE.

A joint optimization of sensing threshold and transmission power is proposed, which maximizes the total throughput subject to the constraints on the total interference, the total power, and the probabilities of false alarm and detection of each subchannel. An alternative joint optimization is proposed, which minimizes the total interference under the constraint of the total throughput. The bilevel optimization method is used to solve the proposed optimization problems with a minimized iteration complexity. The mixed-variable optimization problem is divided into two single-variable convex optimization subproblems: the upper level for threshold optimization and the lower level for power optimization. Weighed cooperative sensing is proposed to maximize the detection probability by choosing the optimal weighed factors.

84880656249	Spectrally efficient transform domain communication system with quadrature cyclic code shift keying	Transform domain communication system (TDCS), as an overlay cognitive radio communication system, has been proposed to obtain a low probability of interception by using spectrum bin nulling to synthesise an adaptive waveform corresponding to the spectrum sensing output. However, its low spectral efficiency limits potential practical applications. In this study, an efficient modulation scheme, namely quadrature cyclic code shift keying (Q-CCSK), is proposed for TDCSs by generating another fundamental modulation waveform as the data-bearing quadrature branch. Although using Q-CCSK doubles the spectral efficiency for TDCSs, the instinct inter-branch interference arises from the added quadrature branch. Through the orthogonality analysis, it is proven that the two branches (in-phase and quadrature- branches) are still satisfied the property of quasi-orthogonality. Moreover, the performances of TDCSs employing Q-CCSK in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath fading channels are discussed, respectively. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that, compared with conventional schemes, the TDCS employing Q-CCSK can double the spectral efficiency with comparable systematic performance. ©The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.

84880797938	Cluster-based transform domain communication systems for high spectrum efficiency	This study presents a cluster-based transform domain communication system (TDCS) to improve spectrum efficiency. Unlike the utilities of clusters in orthogonal frequency division multiplex systems, the cluster-based TDCS framework divides entire unoccupied spectrum bins into L clusters, where each one represents a data stream independently, to achieve L times of spectrum efficiency compared to that of the traditional one. Among various schemes of spectrum bin spacing and allocation, the TDCS with random allocation scheme appears to be an ideal candidate to significantly improve spectrum efficiency without seriously degrading power efficiency. In multipath fading channel, the coded TDCS with random allocation scheme achieves robust bit error rate (BER) performance owing to a large degree of frequency diversity. Furthermore, this study shows that the smaller spectrum bin spacing should be configured for the cluster-based TDCS to achieve higher spectrum efficiency and more robust BER performance.

84881031204	Low-complexity iterative row-column soft decision feedback algorithm for 2-D inter-symbol interference channel detection with gaussian approximation	In this paper, we study the complexity reduction problem of the iterative row-column soft decision feedback algorithm (IRCSDFA) for 2-D inter-symbol interference (ISI) detection. Specifically, Gaussian approximation (GA) is employed in both the component row and column detectors of the IRCSDFA in order to reduce its computational complexity. With the employment of GA, the state space dimension of the ISI trellis of either component detector can be reduced enormously (i.e., the number of branches in one ISI trellis section decreases). Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm is then employed to perform detection over the GA-simplified ISI trellis. For brevity, we refer to the IRCSDFA with BCJR detection over the GA-simplified ISI trellis as 'IRCSDFA-GA-BCJR'. Next, the iteration scheduling of component detectors and decoder in coded 2-D ISI channels with low density parity check (LDPC) coding and IRCSDFA-GA-BCJR detection is studied. Specifically, three iteration schemes: single detector (row or column) scheme, alternate detector scheme, and combined detector scheme, are considered, with the last scheme showing the best coded performance. Finally, the computational complexity of the proposed IRCSDFA-GA-BCJR is analyzed, and shown to have significant reduction with a cost of only about 0.3 and 0.35 dB in coded BER/FER performance loss compared to the conventional IRCSDFA without GA and the optimal symbol-based BCJR algorithm, respectively. © 1965-2012 IEEE.

84884678143	Asymmetric iterative multi-track detection for 2-D non-binary LDPC-coded magnetic recording	Inter-track interference (ITI) is a major source of signal impairment in the next-generation magnetic recording systems. The single-track read channel model, combined with anti-ITI signal detection schemes, is a popular way to recover single-track data from a readback signal corrupted by the ITI. On the other hand, the multi-track read channel model can be used to simultaneously recover multi-track data from a readback signal. However, the performance of multi-track detection is severely degraded by the weak signals from the sidetracks and the indistinguishable symbols. To improve this performance, in this paper we propose a two-dimensional coding in conjunction with an asymmetric iterative multi-track detection (A-IMD) scheme, which uses joint channel detection and decoding of two parallel six-symbol-based detectors concatenated with two parallel non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) decoder over GF(4), to iteratively recover four-track data from two readback signals. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the multi-track detection can indeed be greatly improved by using the proposed A-IMD scheme. © 1965-2012 IEEE.

84891500870	High-order intensity modulations for ostbc in free-space optical mimo communications	Recently, Simon-Vilnrotter and Premaratne-Zheng modified the binary pulse-position modulation (PPM) to support free-space optical (FSO) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems with orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) that requires the use of negative symbols. In this paper, we extend the investigation to optical OSTBC schemes with high-order intensity modulation. A necessary and sufficient condition for the high-order intensity modulation to maintain the orthogonality of the applied OSTBC is derived, and four Q-ary intensity modulation schemes satisfying this condition are proposed. In asynchronous FSO MIMO channels in which the signals from different transmitters arrive at the receiver with timing misalignment, the proposed modulation schemes can be used with shift-OSTBC to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) and provide diversity gain. © 2013 IEEE.

84891634245	TDCS-based cognitive radio networks with multiuser interference avoidance	For overlay cognitive radio networks (CRNs), transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to support multiuser communications through spectrum bin nulling and frequency domain spreading. In TDCS-based CRNs, each user is assigned a specific pseudorandom spreading sequence. However, the existence of multiuser interference (MUI) is one of main concerns, due to the non-zero cross-correlations between any pair of TDCS signals. In this paper, a novel framework of TDCS-based CRNs with the joint design of sequences and modulation schemes is presented to realize MUI avoidance. With the uncertainty of spectrum sensing results in CRNs, we first introduce a unique sequence design through two-dimensional time-frequency synthesis and obtain a class of almost perfect sequences whose periodic auto-correlation and cross-correlations are identically zero for most circular shifts. These correlation properties are further exploited in conjunction with a specially-designed cyclic code shift keying in order to achieve the advantage of MUI avoidance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed TDCS-based CRNs are well suited for decentralized networks against the near-far problem. © 2013 IEEE.

84893295016	Improved spectrum efficiency for transform domain communication systems	As an overlay cognitive radio system, transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to support multiuser communication with low spectral density by using spectrum bin nulling and frequency domain spreading. It has been shown that TDCS has a low spectrum efficiency compared to other wireless communication systems. To solve this problem, this paper presents a cluster-based TDCS scheme to improve spectrum efficiency. Different from the utility of clusters in OFDM systems, the entire unoccupied spectrum bins are divided into L clusters, where each one is used for transmitting the data stream independently, to obtain L times spectrum efficiency of the traditional scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TDCS using random allocation scheme is shown to provide the capability of improving spectrum efficiency without seriously degrading power efficiency. © 2013 IEEE.

84898983421	Joint optimization of cooperative users and sub-band power for cooperative spectrum sensing and communication in wideband cognitive radio	We propose cooperative sensing and communication for wideband cognitive radio (CR), which allows second user (SU) to perform transmission and cooperative communication at the presence of primary user (PU). A joint optimization of the number of SUs and power allocation is proposed, which maximizes the total throughput of SUs while keeping the total throughput of PU above the normal throughput. Simulations show that the proposed joint optimization can achieve larger total throughput of SU while improving the throughput of PU with higher maximal power. © 2013 IEEE.

84899088579	Linearly-encodable rate-compatible punctured LDPC codes with low error floor	We propose a class of rate-compatible (RC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that has linear encoding complexity and low error floor. To ensure linear encoding, a deterministic form for the parity part of the mother parity-check matrix is used. To guarantee good performances in the waterfall region for a wide range of code rates, a layered density evolution algorithm is developed to obtain the degree distributions. Then, a layered node-connection algorithm is proposed to lower the error floor by increasing the values of extrinsic-message degrees of the codes. Simulation results show that no error floor is observed at a frame error rate of 10

84900645132	Construction of irregular QC-LDPC codes via masking with ACE optimization	Quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes constructed by using algebraic approaches, such as finite geometry and finite field, generally have good structural properties and very low error-floors, and facilitate hardware implementation. Irregular QC-LDPC codes constructed from such QC-LDPC codes by using the masking technique, when decoded with the sum-product algorithm (SPA), have low decoding complexity, but often show early error-floors. In this paper, the relationship of cycle, girth and approximate cycle EMD (ACE) between the masking matrix and masked matrix is investigated, and the ACE algorithm is modified and used to construct the masking matrix for irregular QC-LDPC codes. Simulations demonstrate that the codes constructed by masking with ACE optimization exhibit much improved waterfall performance and lower error floors. © 2014 IEEE.

84907206738	Narrow-band interference suppression in impulse-radio ultrawideband systems	For impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) communications, pulse overlap often occurs in indoor dense multipath environments, where the time separation between adjacent received multipaths is typically less than one pulsewidth. Moreover, due to its low power spectral density (PSD) and its overlay usage model, the IR-UWB signal is also vulnerable to narrow-band interference (NBI) of a high power level. Taking the effect of pulse overlap into account, this paper presents an optimal prerake/postrake UWB transceiver design to counteract NBI. The prerake/postrake uses rake structures at both the transmitter and the receiver. The optimum weights for the prerake and postrake are derived by maximizing the signal-to-inference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Furthermore, an adaptive scheme is proposed to achieve the optimal solution iteratively. Simulations show that the proposed prerake/postrake and the adaptive scheme can significantly eliminate the adverse effect of NBI and thus perform well even in the presence of severe NBI.

84908887471	On the modulation and signalling design for a transform domain communication system	Transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to establish a communication link with a low probability of interception by synthesising an adaptive waveform containing energy only in the unused frequency bands. However, this communication system suffers from a low spectral efficiency. To improve its spectral efficiency, a unified modulation framework for a TDCS is proposed in this study to embrace the previously reported modulation schemes under one framework. The resulting spectral efficiency is higher compared to these previous schemes. Also, to combat the slow channel fading, a TDCS system using two transmit antennas and one receive antenna with the proposed modulation scheme is presented. Simulation results show that the multiple-antenna system improves the performance dramatically compared to the single antenna system under the slow fading environment.

84915745435	Improved min-sum decoding for 2-D intersymbol interference channels	In this paper, 2-D normalized min-sum (NMS) algorithm and offset min-sum (OMS) algorithm are proposed for efficient decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in 2-D intersymbol interference (ISI) ultra-high density magnetic recording channels, such as bit-patterned magnetic recording and 2-D magnetic recording, where a reduced-complexity 2-D detector based on the iterative row-column soft detection feedback with Gaussian approximation detector is employed instead of the full 2-D Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector. The normalization and offset factors of the 2-D NMS and 2-D-OMS, are optimized based on the extended density evolution for LDPC coded 2-D ISI channel, respectively. Simulation results show the performance loss caused by the reduced-complexity LDPC decoder can be almost fully recovered by the proposed approaches, while retaining the benefit of low complexity in decoder compared with the belief propagation (BP) decoding. Furthermore, both the NMS and OMS exhibit a lower error floor than that of BP decoding in high signal-to-noise ratio region.

84914665845	Combined orthogonal physical-layer network coding over fading two-way relay channels	This paper proposes a new physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme, named combined orthogonal PNC (COPNC), for fading two-way relay channels. The scheme is based on orthogonal PNC (OPNC). In the scheme, the two source nodes employ orthogonal carriers, and the relay node makes an orthogonal combining of the two information bits rather than exclusive or (XOR), which is employed in most PNC schemes. The paper also analyzes the bit error rate (BER) performance of PNC, OPNC, and COPNC for Rayleigh fading model. Simulation results for Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels show that COPNC can provide outstanding BER performance compared with PNC and OPNC, especially when the uplink channel conditions are asymmetric. The results in Nakagami-m channels also imply that COPNC will provide higher BER gain with more severe fading depth. Potential works about COPNC are also presented in this paper.

84919658186	Sequence design for cognitive CDMA communications under arbitrary spectrum hole constraint	To support interference-free quasi-synchronous code-division multiple-access (QS-CDMA) communication with low spectral density profile in a cognitive radio (CR) network, it is desirable to design a set of CDMA spreading sequences with zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) property. However, traditional ZCZ sequences (which assume the availability of the entire spectral band) cannot be used because their orthogonality will be destroyed by the spectrum hole constraint in a CR channel. To date, analytical construction of ZCZ CR sequences remains open. Taking advantage of the Kronecker sequence property, a novel family of sequences (called »quasi-ZCZ» CR sequences) which displays zero cross-correlation and near-zero auto-correlation zone property under arbitrary spectrum hole constraint is presented in this paper. Furthermore, a novel algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and the periodic auto-correlations of the proposed quasi-ZCZ CR sequences. Simulations show that they give rise to single-user bit-error-rate performance in CR-CDMA systems which outperform traditional non-contiguous multicarrier CDMA and transform domain communication systems; they also lead to CR-CDMA systems which are more resilient than non-contiguous OFDM systems to spectrum sensing mismatch, due to the wideband spreading.
