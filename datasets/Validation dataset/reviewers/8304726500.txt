17944364413	Method considering inter-layer interactions for analysis of multi-layers landslides	There are complex landslides with several layers of slipping plane in the geotechnical engineering. In this paper, a new method to analysis the multi-layers landslide is presented. Every layer of sliding masses when calculating the slope stability and landslide-thrust distribution is analyzed. The upper layer of the sliding mass is analysed by using the common transfer coefficient method. When the lower layers of the sliding masses are analysed, the weight of the upper layer but the effects of the upper mass on the layer below can be ignored. The method was applied to a practical project, and the results show: (1) the safety factor of the slope calculated by the new method is with the same as the general method; (2) because the anti-sliding pile intercepts the sliding mass, the landslide thrusts of different layers of sliding mass act on the pile separately. Therefore, the total landslide thrust is varied with different methods; (3) when the upper sliding mass has different design safety factors, the landslide-thrust of the upper mass and the total landslide-thrust are different. The calculated results by the new method make the design of anti-sliding structures more reasonable.

The research result shows that the fast weathering of the red-bed mudstone slope occurs within 10 cm depth below the surface, and the variation of air temperature and the number of moderate rainfall have important effects on its fast weathering. The weathering rate increases with the heightening of air temperature and its difference, and the weathering deposits increase with the increment of the number of moderate rainfall. Furthermore, a big air temperature difference between the surface and inside of red-bed mudstone caused by rainfall is the key external factor affecting the fast weathering.

It is concluded that the ecological protecting functions on the fast weathering of the red bed mudstone slope include eliminating the weathering material erosion and changing the temperature field and the moisture content of the shallow layer bed mudstone slope. More importantly, the ecological protection prevents the red bed mudstone slope surface from rain, making no high difference in temperature and the thermal stress in the shallow layer.

However, the design of this system is mainly preformed based on the experience of engineers. Few methods can be used to evaluate the slope stability. A new method for evaluating the stability of the slope protected by flexible active protection system is put forward. First, the strengthened force of unit steel wire net can be obtained by analyzing the steel wire material. Secondly, the boundary of the maximal potential fail rock block can be determined by field investigation, and the safety factor of the rock block can be calculated through the formulae deduced from the classical wedge theory. In practical calculation, the designer can define the design safety factor beforehand, and the volume of the maximal rock block protected by the flexible system can be obtained based on field investigation. The comparison between the maximal volume and the field rock blocks is made. If the maximal volume is larger than all the field rock blocks, the stability of the slope is acceptable. Otherwise, the slope must be reinforced.

Considering its merits including easy to install, high efficiency, low cost and artistic effect on slopes, it has been widely used in many fields of domestic industries, such as hydropower station, civil transportation and mining engineering. Though the feasibility of combining herbage protection with the SNS active system does exist, few practical engineering using this method were put into effect. The study on this issue is also scarce. This paper summarizes the conventional ways to afforest slopes, discuss the feasibility of combining SNS active protection with slope vegetation, and suggest that three vegetation ways can be used to the slopes reinforced by the SNS active system. The proper amendment of these vegetation ways is presented. A new method of evaluating the stability of the slope protected by the flexible active protection system is put forward. The reinforcing effect of slope protection with herbage at shallow layer is demonstrated; a simplified geometrical model to simulate the situation of the slope is proposed, from which formulas used to calculate safety factor can be deduced; and a practical engineering slope is used to testify the formulas. The results show that the formulas are applicable. The following conclusions can be drawn: (1) the SNS active protection can successfully reinforce slopes; (2) the SNS-herbage protection overcomes the inconvenience of traditional ways to reinforce slopes, improves the effect of the vegetation, and becomes a developing method with ecological and social benefits. So, the SNS combined with herbage protection is recommended.

Therefore, some slopes cannot be reinforced efficiently by foundation beam with prestressed cable because of the unreasonable designed anchorage-angle. A new method for designing the reasonable anchorage-angle is proposed. Firstly, an initial criterion there is no slip between the beam and the slope surface is proposed. Secondly, the highest possible anchorage power must be obtained in the design, and it is the design objective. Prestressed utilization-ratio is defined as the ratio of the real anchorage stress to anchor-cable prestress. So, the anchorage angle can be determined rationally considering the initial criterion and the utilization-ratio and giving attention to the economic and construction factors. Finally, an engineering example is given to explain how to use this method in practice.

33646523401	Distribution of land-slide thrust on anti-slide piles	In the existing engineering projects, the distribution of landslide thrust on anti-slide piles is approximately determined to be triangular, rectangular, or trapezoid based on rock characters of the sliding mass. A new method was proposed to improve the calculation of distribution according to stability of the mass sliding through a specified shear opening. It was assumed that the potential slide surface was composed of a part of the original slide surface and a circular surface through the specified shear opening. Firstly, the stability of mass above the potential surfaces was calculated and the minimum safety coefficient of the specified shear opening was determined. If this safety coefficient was less than the design value, then the landslide thrust of the corresponding slide surface was calculated by Janbu Method. The shear openings were specified at the pile from top to bottom with a certain interval. By this method, the landslide thrust at many points of the pile could be calculated. The increment of landslide thrust of the section between two neighboring shear openings could be obtained by comparing the landslide thrust of neighboring shear openings. So, the distribution of landslide thrust on the pile from top to bottom could be determined.

It is thus meaningful to study the expanding effects of vertical cracks under dynamic loads. Based on the stress state at vertical crack tips under horizontal tensile stress, the stress concentration is analyzed as the criterion for both crack initiation and expansion. In addition, a calculation method is proposed for the distance along rock layers after the rocks is fractured. A pseudo-static method is employed to derive the stress distribution of open-type cracks under horizontal loads, from which the quantity and location of explosives can be calculated to prevent crack expansions.

To simplify design of prestressed cable-anchors for non-circular landslides, the external forces are designated and the number of cable-anchors is determined according to the force shadows. The acting forces of cable-anchors are considered to concentrate on the slip-surface. Actually, they have been spreaded to the ground-surface through the slide-body and the force and moment equilibrium conditions cannot be satisfied. The equation is less than reasonable and leaves some defects to be overcome. There may even occur serious results of damages during overloading caused by improper setting of achors. This paper adopts the fundamental assumptions of the Morgenstern-Price Method according to the stressed conditions and deduces the iterative formula under the equilibrium conditions for calculation of assigned external forces of cable-anchors.

The model is performed based on the slope structures, which are established from geological information. There are many differences between slope structures and rock masses because rock mass of slope will be encountered with the epigenetic reformation and natural forces. The main difference is that rock mass of slope has the special engineering geological properties, such as traces of epigenetic reformation, the surface weathering, rock mass stress relaxation, erosion of surface water and so on. The rocky slope structure now only contains rock masses and its geological tectonic surfaces, and it will necessarily be enriched by these properties.

But at present, few researches on the anti-sliding mechanism of the structure have been done. In order to provide theoretical support and technique service for the design and construction, the corresponding studies must be urgently conducted. Three types of the micro-pile composite anti-sliding structures have been summarized according to their setting places on the slope, namely, type of slope surface reinforcement, type of slope step reinforcement, type of slope foot reinforcement. Some key problems and applicable conditions are discussed for the design of these structures. Among these structures, the composite structure of micro-pile fixed by the tip beam is usually more adopted in projects. According to the relationship of pile-soil interaction, the anti-sliding mechanism of the composite structure is discussed. The composite structure improves the shear strength of the sliding surface; and the pile-soil system behaves better in anti-sliding effect. The anti-sliding mechanism of the system is not same as the one of the common retaining pile. The anti-sliding effect of the system is achieved by the tensile strength of the micro-pile and the bearing capacity of foundation of soil and pile, but not by the whole bend ability as the common retaining pile. In order to obtain the axial force of the micro-pile, the design theory is put forward according to the method of elastic foundation beam with restriction of transverse deformation. Application of the design theory to a slope project shows that the theory is reasonable and easy.

In this way, internal forces of the structure and the required length of the anchoring section of the micropiles can be obtained. This information is used directly in practical design. Analysis shows that each micropile in the structure is mainly loaded by an axial force, but the roof plate is principally subject to a bending moment. The new structure and the analysis method proposed in this paper are successfully used in practice for a cutting slope in a Guangyuan-Bazhong expressway project in Sichuan Province, China, and the performance of the structure is verified. © 2009 ASCE.

77951007551	Point safety factor method for stability analysis of landslide	A 3-D model for numerical calculation of landslide is proposed; and a high-precision eight-node hexahedron element is used to build the finite element grid of slip layer. The slip layer material is simulated by an ideal elastoplastic model based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Three-dimensional stress state and slide direction of the slip layer zone are obtained by numerical computation. So based on the analysis of the three-dimensional stress state of the slip layer zone, a point safety factor as the ratio of the shear strength of the slip zone to the shear stress parallel to the gliding direction is defined; and the safety factor of the landslide as the weighted average value of the zone point safety factor with its zone is defined. The sliding mechanism is studied through zone point safety factor; and landslide stability can be evaluated through the safety factor. The case studies show that the calculated results are consistent with the actual cases.

77951624296	Seismic damage analysis of road slopes in Wenchuan earthquake	Seismic damages of road slopes in mountainous areas have different characteristics in mechanism and types from those in flain. Based on cases of damaged road slopes in the Wenchuan earthquake, failure mechanisms and types of the road slopes for cutting and embankment slope and slopes around bridge and tunnel, as well as retaining structures, are analyzed. Slopes stabilized by using anchored foundation beams or lateral loaded piles with prestressed anchors have better performance in the earthquake. The reason is that these structures make both structures and soils become integral, and so deformation between structures and soil is consistent. Geogrid or other reinforced embankment slopes have better performance in the earthquake; but the aseismic performance of embankments without reinforcement, particularly high embankments, is poor. Based on the cases of liquefaction or soft soil layer-induced settlement, it is suggested that engineers in aseismic design should pay attention to liquefaction-induced settlement at the toe of the slopes constructed on sandy soil layers and take measures to prevent from pavement failure caused by the settlement on soft soil layers and slope instability caused by the settlement at the toe of the slope. At tunnel portals and portal slopes, engineers should strengthen aseismic design of retaining structures. Safety and stabilization of bridge abutment, foundation and transition between abutment and embankment constructed on slopes are dependent of the slope stability; and so aseismic design of the slope, on which those structures are constructed, should be strengthened. For bridges constructed along the bank of river, unstable slope can damage the bridges, some measures in aseismic design should, therefore, be taken into consideration. At present, codes for aseismic design of roads and railway have few contents for how to design slope and retaining structures; and so the achievements obtained will be helpful to revision and supplementary of the codes.

77955030086	Slope structure and excavation deformation regularity of high slope composed with red bed accumulation body	The high red bed accumulation body slope is a particular type in red beds areas. It is widely distributed in Guangyuan-Bazhong expressway. Starting from the reform process of red bed accumulation body, and based on the geological checking investigation, the red bed accumulation body is divided into M type, double-M type and single side type by slope top shape; and at the same time, the red bed accumulation body is divided into layered accumulation body, mass rock and soil accumulation body, clay layer beneath mass rock and soil accumulation body, mass rock and clay mix up big solitary stone by soil types and accumulation types. The excavation deformation characteristics of the four types are analyzed through the field survey data and assisted by MIDAS/GTS (MIDAS/geotechnical and tunnel analysis system). The superficial partial slumps appear in all the types of accumulation body slopes. In layered accumulation body, tractive consequent landslide is the main pattern of sliding. While circular sliding face and plane sliding along the bedrock appear in the accumulation body which includes mass rock and soil or clay. The slope deformation and failure types with solitary stone changed obviously by variety of size and location of inside solitary stone. The geological checking investigation and numerical simulation results also show that besides structure type of accumulation body, the shape of bedrock and obliquity can also affect the deform characteristics. The characteristic of red bed accumulation body has the same diversification with the red bed slope. The results provide a basis for analyze the disease patterns and mechanism, and also provide a foundation for the design of red bed accumulation body area.

77956869283	Stability analysis of consequent rock slopes using elastic-plastic plate theory	Flexural failures often occur in construction of consequent rock slopes. The elastic compression bar theory and the elastic plate theory are often used in the stability analysis of consequent rock slopes for flexural failure mode. Rock plates are assumed as one-dimensional compression bar in the elastic compression bar theory and two-dimensional plate in the elastic plate theory. The influences of rock plasticity on the slope stability are not considered in the above two methods. For the flexural failure mode, if stresses in rock strata are large enough to exceed their elastic limits, the rock material will sustain both elastic and plastic strains. In such a case, the application of the elastic theory may lead to unreasonable results. On the basis of the stability theory for elastic-plastic plates, a study on the mechanism of flexural failure of consequent rock slopes is carried out by using the energy method. The influences of slope length and plasticity of rock mass are considered particularly in deducing the computational formula for the stability analysis of consequent rock slopes. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by some practical engineering cases.

78149491900	Geological analysis and model experimental study of deformation mechanism of Ditch-Moore red bed landslide at Qinghai Plateau	Taking the Ditch-Moore #DH6 landslide in Xijiu road(S101) as typical representation, the deformation mechanism of red bed landslide at Qinghai Plateau affected by valley incision and rainfall infiltration was studied by geological analysis and geotechnical model test. In geomechanical model test, slope excavation is used to simulate the valley incision; and the technique of capillary infiltration is used to simulate the rainfall infiltration. Displacement is an important index of the test. The influence of valley incision and rainfall infiltration on slope displacement are analyzed separately; then a comprehensive analysis of two factors is made; and the roles of two weights are analyzed. The results indicate that valley incision and rainfall infiltration play important roles in the deformation of red bed landslide. The root causes of slope deformation are two strength degradation process based on special ground nature of red bed:(1) Unloading relaxation caused by valley incision(the first intensity attenuation) and the invading surface are the basis for the emergence of landslide; (2) Long-term softening of rock mass strength induced by rainwater infiltration(second intensity decay) is the direct cause of landslide development. Therefore, the mechanism of the red bed landslide is summarized as "the original landscape → valley incision → valley slope relaxation → geotechnical strength decay → rainfall infiltration → geotechnical strength decay further → overall slip" by comprehensive analysis as the representative to the Ditch-Moore #DH6 landslide.

78650781219	The buckling analysis of the pressed micro-pile in slope project	The calculation model of the pressed pile in the micropile composite structure was established considering the soil resistance to analyze the buckling of the pressed micropile. The theoretical calculation formula of the critical load was deduced with different distribution pattern of the subgrade resistance such as constant method, m-method, k-method by Galerkin equation, which was based on the virtual displacement principle. Accordingly, the calculation length coefficient of the pressed piles could be derived. Analytical results show that the critical load obtained by the theoretical calculation is very sensitive to the soil parameter. It is impractical to choose m-method and k-method as the subgrade resistance, because the calculation length coefficient reduces too fast with αl increasing. For the micropile with relatively larger slenderness ratio, the constant method distribution pattern of the subgrade resistance can achieve reasonable and appropriate results.

0035508717	A new rheological model for rocks	Rheological deformation is a basic mechanical property of rock. All rocks have acceleration creep property. Conventional rheologic models can't study accelerated creep property but deceleration creep and equal velocity creep properties of rock. A new rheological multiple model is put forward to study accelerated creep of rock, based on rheological properties of rock. The new rheological multiple model can contain the properties of many conventional rheological models. The good results are obtained when it is applied to analyze creep testing data of fault rock from the dam site of a large hydro-power station on Yalong River of China.

80053185680	The pile group efficiency of micropiles structure	Large number of experiments shows that pile spacing, pile diameter, pile number and soil characteristics are the main factors of pile groups' properties. With numerical simulation method, the project analyzes the pile group status as 2D geotechnical problem and calculates the influence of back row pile with the displacement of front row, and then derives empirical formula. The formula simplifies the group calculation to the single pile reduction of subgrade resistance. The results and calculation of existing methods are inosculating. The results show that the pile group efficiency can be neglected in rock slope. Pile spacing and soil internal friction angle φ is the main factors of the group efficiency. And it increases while pile spacing is increasing and the number of piles is decreasing. If the number of front and back row piles are the same, the empirical formula can get better results. While φ≥ 35°, the deduction of soil resistance by cohesion strength can be neglect. © 2011 ASCE.

84862331277	Experiment research on change law of internal force of dispersed pressure anchor cable	Adopting the grading cyclic loading method in each bearing unit of dispersed pressure anchor cable, the changing law of internal force of each unit is studied by new geological mechanics model test. According to the test methods and the state of force of the dispersed pressure anchor cable, the elastic theoretical solution which is under the conditions of grading cyclic loading and based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion is deduced. The test results show that, under the conditions of soft rock and silty soil, the strain and shear stress distribution of the former grouting body is relatively more concentrated, the influence between units is relatively minor during the loading process. And the elastic theoretical solution based on the Mohr-Coulomb criterion can describe the strain and shear stress distribution rule of grouting body better after grading cyclic loading. The research results have a good reference value for correctly analyzing reinforcing mechanism of the dispersed pressure anchor cable and engineering design.

84865400474	Model test study of anchoring and reinforcing mechanism of pressure diffusion anchor cable	A new test device and a new test method are adopted to implement grading cyclic loading onto each anchor unit and study the anchoring and reinforcing mechanism of pressure diffusion anchor cable by geological mechanics model test. The test results show that: as far as the pressure diffusion anchor cable with two anchor units is concerned, the strain and axial force of the grouting body of the first unit are influenced by the distance between the bearings and attenuates faster than that of another unit, the mode of the strain distribution and the average bond stress distribution of the units are smaller in the front unit and bigger in the back unit after loading. For the pressure diffusion anchor cable with three anchor units, compared with the previous loading, the peak strain and axial force of the first unit fall with different levels after loading 0.6 kN onto the 2nd and 3rd units; and the average bond stresses of the loaded unit and unloaded unit are improved. For the pressure diffusion anchor cable with four anchor units, the peak strain and axial force and average bond stress of loading unit or unloaded unit have been improved, while the peak strain axial force and average bond stress of the loaded units reduce after grading cyclic loading. Under conditions of certain anchor length, the number of the bearing body has a considerable influence on the effective transfer of loads, especially the bond stress transfers in different ways. The experimental results have a good reference value for the correct analysis of anchoring and reinforcing mechanism and engineering design of the pressure diffusion anchor cable.

84869782221	Stress influence between unit anchor bodies for compression dispersion-type anchored cables	There is stress influence between the unit anchor bodies for compression dispersion-type anchored cables. The first display of the influence is the stress superposition effect appearing in the compressive force transfer direction. The degree of the effect is different owing to the constraint force of rock around the hole on cement grouting body. The effect is very significant in weak rock mass with lower constraint force and not significant in hard rock mass with strong constraint force. The second display of the influence is that the tensile stress appears in the grouting body connected to pressure plates of the unit anchor bodies while the compressive stress superposition effect appears. The grouting body will be cracked if the stress is equal to the tensile strength, and the tension crack is not good for corrosion resistance of the anchored cables. In order to prevent the detriment to anchorage engineering, the optimization of the length of unit anchor body in the hard rock mass is suggested to avoid tension cracks, and the check of the strength of cement grouting body in the soft rock mass is proposed based on the stresses of the unit anchor body with the most serious stress superposition effect so as to avoid the damage of the grouting body and to enable the shear stress on cement grout-rock interface to be controlled.

The rationality of this method has been verified by the results of shaking table test and numerical simulation. This method not only considers the amplitude-time-frequency effects, but also can forecast the safety of the slope, the time occurring the landslide and its scale. At the same time, this method can provide the valuable references for the time-history seismic design of retaining structure in the high intensity earthquake area.

84882995002	Some problems to be considered in design for compression dispersion-type anchor cables	On the analysis of anchoring mechanism for compression dispersion-type anchor cable, three problems that should be considered in the anchor cable design have been put forward, namely the calculation of unit anchor length, the deformation of grouting body near pressure plate and the nonuniform loads of steel strand wires caused by the rock mass deformation after slope completed. The anchorage force has been improved to compare with tension type anchor cable, because the radial expansion deformation of grouting body is restrained by the rock mass. The hard the rock mass is, the stronger the restriction is; and the more the improved anchorage force, otherwise, the smaller. A formula for calculating anchoring length, of which the physical concept is clear and calculation simple, is presented, together with the formula to determine the deformation of the grouting body near pressure plate. In order to eliminate the nonuniform loads, the anchor cable tension method is recommended, in which rock mass permitted displacement after slope completed is considered; and the detailed tension order and the calculation formulas are also given.

84891852218	Model test study of anti-sliding mechanism of micro-pile combined structure	Adopting the step loading method on combined structure of spatial truss micro-pile system as supporting structure, the changing law of internal force of micro-pile system is studied by new geological mechanics model test. According to the test methods and the state of force of the space truss micro-pile system, the structural analysis solution which is under the conditions of step cyclic loading and based on the elastic foundation beam constrained laterally is deduced. The test results show that, under the conditions of the broken-rock soil, the link beam can effectively limit the micro displacement of pile top; and the moment of pile body reduced; the soil pressure distribution in front of the pile is relatively uniform in sliding body; the distribution of the moment of each row of micro-piles is relatively close to each other; the maximum moment is close to the sliding face. The structural analysis solution based on the elastic foundation beam constrained laterally deformation can describe the changing law of internal force and distribution rule of micro-pile system after step cyclic loading better. The research results have a good reference value for correct analysis of anti-sliding mechanism and anti-sliding design of the micro-pile.

84903889020	Research on the corrosion test of micro-pile anti-slide structure	Research purposes: The application time of micro-pile is not long enough to discover the problem of anti-corrosive durability. There is also no relevant terms yet about the anti-corrosive durability of micro-pile in the current codes. There are two ways of micro-pile corrosion: the reinforcement corrosion and the cement mortar corrosion of piles. For the engineering application, the laboratory corrosion test of dry and wet cycle and the general loading test were conducted. The bond behavior with rocks and the bending fracture failure of micro-pile under different corrosion degree were studied. Research conclusions: The test results show: (1)The micro-pile with smaller water cement ratio and larger cement sand ratio, was performed better bond behavior and corrosion durability. (2)The stress distribution was optimized in order to reduce the large cracks by separated reinforcement by physical isolated method. This also improved the bearing capacity of micro-pile structure. (3)Based on the research, several suggestions of micro-pile corrosion durability were proposed, such as design working life, pile diameter and protective layer, and were recommended for design reference.

84910125739	Design method for multi-frame beams with anchor bolts used to stabilize high soft-rock slope	In order to avoid the disadvantages of the existing design methods for multi-frame beams with anchor bolts used to stabilize high soft-rock slopes, a novel design method was proposed on the basis of interaction mechanism between a structure and a slope. With the proposed method, tensile forces of anchor bolts are determined by analyzing slope stability in terms of design safety factor and failure mode of a slope, and then internal forces of frame beams are calculated from static equilibrium and deformation compatibility conditions between anchor bolts and frame beams and the Winkler foundation model used to interpret interaction between frame beams and a slope. The method was verified by a laboratory model test. The research results show that the distribution mode of slope pressure on every frame beam is a parabola in the direction of the longitudinal axis.
