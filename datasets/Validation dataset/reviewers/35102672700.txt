84929574208	Novel unequal spacing multi-pulses technology to enhance SNR for pulse laser radar	A novel multi-pulses technology with unequal space to enhance SNR of pulse laser radar is proposed in this letter. Traditional multi-pulses technology employing equal spaces multi-pulses always leads to many outputs once the time window has pulses no matter the number of pulses, which is difficult to identify which one is the main pulse we want to get. Thus we propose a method using unequal spaces multi-pulses to improve the poor performance of the equal space multi-pulses technology, which means our method will get only one pulse output when the time window has pulses input. Both simulation and experimental results show the validity of our algorithm.

Most mobile robots adopt dead reckoning for navigation because of its high efficiency and low cost. In order to use this navigation mechanism, both distance information and directional information must be available. In this research, a real-time three-channel camera-based polarization navigation sensor is developed to provide directional information for robot navigation. The accuracy of the sensor can be kept within 0.3° and the sampling rate of the sensor can reach up to 10 fps. For the purpose of navigation, the developed polarization sensor is compared with a compass through outdoor experiments and a new calibration method for the polarization sensor in the outdoor experiments is proposed. The results of dead reckoning based on the polarization sensor and compass are compared with GPS data. The maximum position errors for the compass and polarization sensor are respectively 7.30 m and 8.36 m. Therefore, the developed low-cost polarization sensor can serve as a useful alternative to compass.

41549103431	Localization algorithm based on a spring model (LASM) for large scale wireless sensor networks	A navigation method for a lunar rover based on large scale wireless sensor networks is proposed. To obtain high navigation accuracy and large exploration area, high node localization accuracy and large network scale are required. However, the computational and communication complexity and time consumption are greatly increased with the increase of the network scales. A localization algorithm based on a spring model (LASM) method is proposed to reduce the computational complexity, while maintaining the localization accuracy in large scale sensor networks. The algorithm simulates the dynamics of physical spring system to estimate the positions of nodes. The sensor nodes are set as particles with masses and connected with neighbor nodes by virtual springs. The virtual springs will force the particles move to the original positions, the node positions correspondingly, from the randomly set positions. Therefore, a blind node position can be determined from the LASM algorithm by calculating the related forces with the neighbor nodes. The computational and communication complexity are O(1) for each node, since the number of the neighbor nodes does not increase proportionally with the network scale size. Three patches are proposed to avoid local optimization, kick out bad nodes and deal with node variation. Simulation results show that the computational and communication complexity are almost constant despite of the increase of the network scale size. The time consumption has also been proven to remain almost constant since the calculation steps are almost unrelated with the network scale size. © 2008 by MDPI.

49249088650	Data fusion based on RBF and nonparametric estimation for localization in wireless sensor networks	Localization is one of important functions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). And Data fusion is commonly regarded as an efficient method that can improve precision of localization. The paper proposed a novel method based on nonparametric estimation techniques and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks to decrease the indeterminacy of Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements. The different sources of errors for each measurement types cause that the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of measurements are not completely dependent. So, theoretically, the fusion of the two kinds of measurements could be effective. Nonparametric estimation techniques are introduced to resolve the problem that measurements do not completely submit to a known PDF. And RBF networks can partly eliminate the influence of environments by regulation of weights. The paper theoretically demonstrated that the data fusion based on RBF networks could achieve location estimation with the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). After that, simulation results of the classical linear combination method and the single RBF fusion were compared with the proposed method in the paper to demonstrate that the proposed method can improve precision of localization with a little of increment in complexion and is robust to the variance of environments. © 2008 IEEE.

77951455706	A practical evaluation of radio signal strength for mobile robot localization	This paper dealt with localization of a mobile robot using received signal strength (RSS) and detailed a practical evaluation about the suitability of the RSS based localization. RSS technique is especially appealing for localization in WSN due to its simplicity such as low cost, size and power constraints, despite of the fact that RSS may bring in very noisy range estimates. We conducted numerous ranging experiments to quantify the effects of various environmental factors on RSS both in the indoor environment and in the outdoor environment. To further improve the localization performance of mobile robot, we proposed a novel improvement - mean filtering technique to reduce the effect of radio irregularity and optimized the localization results. A series of localization experiments were performed to validate the proposed methods, with achieving the localization error to 1.2m in the outdoor basketball field. © 2009 IEEE.

84885601445	Positioning algorithm based on skylight polarization navigation	Possessing an autonomous navigation and positioning capabilities that does not rely on GPS or other satellite navigation systems is of great importance when satellite signal is out of service. Many insects, such as desert ant Cataglyphis and dung beetle, are able to derive the direction information according to the pattern of polarization in the sky. Inspired by the polarization sensitivity mechanisms of the insects, several kinds of bionic polarization navigation sensors have been developed. However, all of them can only derive the orientation information, but not the latitude and longitude of the current position. In this study, an integrated positioning algorithm based on skylight polarization navigation was proposed. Combining skylight polarization navigation with celestial navigation, the geographical position could be determined by two independent observations. The result validated the feasibility of the algorithm. © 2013 IFAC.

84898807984	An image-based three-camera real-time synchronous skylight polarization pattern measurement system	As a new pattern of navigation approach with the characteristics of high robustness, autonomous characteristics and anti-interference ability, polarization navigation attracts the attention of the experts to perform further researches. A relatively stable skylight polarization pattern exists in a certain time period at a specific place, which acts as the precondition for the completion of the polarization navigation. Therefore, the measurement of skylight polarization is of great importance to the polarization navigation. Various skylight polarization pattern measurement approaches have been performed in the past. However, disadvantages exist in the current measurement instruments, including time delay and non-synchronization. In this paper, a new image-based three-camera skylight polarization pattern measurement system is presented with its real-time and synchronous advantages. The main designing idea of the system is to equip the three cameras with three linear polarizers of different polarization directions, which could perform skylight image acquisition synchronously at the same time. Experiment with this system shows that it is able to obtain the stable skylight polarization pattern with the average time for measurement cycle 1.25s, significantly improving the acquisition time. Validation of the experimental results with theoretical result is also performed, proving the authenticity of measured data. © 2013 IEEE.

84898834639	Robust lane marking detection under different road conditions	In this paper a new lane marking detection algorithm in different road conditions for monocular vision was proposed. Traditional detection algorithms implement the same operation for different road conditions. It is difficult to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of timesaving and robustness in different road conditions. Our algorithm divides the road conditions into two classes. One class is for the clean road, and the other one is for the road with disturbances such as shadows, non-lane markings and vehicles. Our algorithm has its advantages in clean road while has a robust detection of lane markings in complex road. On the remapping image obtained from inverse perspective transformation, a search strategy is used to judge whether pixels belong to the same lane marking. When disturbances appear on the road, this paper uses probabilistic Hough transform to detect lines, and finds out the true lane markings by use of their geometrical features. The experimental results have shown the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm with respect to shadows, changing illumination and non-lane markings. © 2013 IEEE.

84904618454	A bionic camera-based polarization navigation sensor	Navigation and positioning technology is closely related to our routine life activities, from travel to aerospace. Recently it has been found that Cataglyphis (a kind of desert ant) is able to detect the polarization direction of skylight and navigate according to this information. This paper presents a real-time bionic camera-based polarization navigation sensor. This sensor has two workmodes: one is a single-point measurement mode and the other is a multi-point measurement mode. An indoor calibration experiment of the sensor has been done under a beam of standard polarized light. The experiment results show that after noise reduction the accuracy of the sensor can reach up to 0.3256°. It is also compared with GPS and INS (Inertial Navigation System) in the single-point measurement mode through an outdoor experiment. Through time compensation and location compensation, the sensor can be a useful alternative to GPS and INS. In addition, the sensor also can measure the polarization distribution pattern when it works in multi-point measurement mode. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84906975893	Trajectory planning of overtaking for intelligent vehicle based on X-Sin function	One of the common phenomenon on the road is overtaking. Traffic accidents caused by overtaking account for about fifteen percents of the total. Important reasons to the frequent occurrence of overtaking accidents are the improper selection of overtaking time and misoperation. With the development of intelligent vehicle technologies, these issues can be well solved [1]. One of the prerequisite to achieve intelligent vehicle overtaking behavior is overtaking trajectory planning. This paper analyze the method of overtaking trajectory planning on unidirectional two-lane road. We establish X-Sin function overtaking trajectory model and evaluate this model by introducing curvature, road width, and the maximum lateral acceleration as parameters. MATLAB simulation results show that X-Sin function overtaking trajectory can solve some insufficient of existing lane changing model [2]. At last, we get the conclusion that X-Sin function overtaking trajectory is close to real overtaking situation through comparing the results of MATLAB simulation and real vehicle test. Therefore, our study can rapidly provide a safe trajectory for the process of intelligent vehicle overtaking maneuver. © 2014 IEEE.

84906983146	Real-time traffic sign detection and recognition for intelligent vehicle	This paper proposes a stable system for the real time traffic sign detection and recognition, especially for the geometric distortions of traffic sign. In detection phase, color-based segmentation is applied to remove the background, then in the shape analysis subsection, the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to solve the rotation and scaling problems of the traffic sign. A template database which includes the common projection distortion shapes was established to overcome the effects of the projection distortions. For object occlusions, using the method of contours convex hull to weaken the influence of occlusions. Hence, we can obtain the candidate regions of interest (ROIs). In recognition phase, the Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features are extracted from normalized ROIs, we propose a method which uses linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for classification. The system is verified on our intelligent vehicle named as Intelligent Pioneer. This algorithm shows good robust against scaling, occlusion, rotation and projection distortion while the accuracy of recognition is more than 93%. © 2014 IEEE.

84911211218	An improved A* algorithm for searching infinite neighbourhoods	The paths obtained by conventional A* algorithm in grid map are usually not the optimal solutions, which have many turning nodes. To solve these problems, an improved A* algorithm is presented. In this method, the number of searchable neighbourhood is extended to infinite (basic A* algorithm has 8 discrete searchable neighbourhoods), and the search direction can be arbitrary. As a result, the path produced by the improved A* is much shorter and the number of turning nodes is greatly reduced. The proposed method is implemented on our self-developed unmanned vehicle, Intelligent Pioneer. The vehicle experiments and its good performance in the Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China show that the resulting path of our method is more optimal, which observably improves the driving efficiency and stationarity of the unmanned vehicles.

At last, the occupancy locations of dynamic obstacles and static obstacles are distinguished and marked in the occupancy grid map. This approach can accurately detect the obstacle motion information in outdoor environments, eliminate positional deviation caused by sensor data processing delay and accurately represent the dynamic and static obstacles information in the environment with the occupancy grid map. This approach is applied to our selfdeveloped unmanned vehicle. Large amount of experiments and the outstanding performance of our unmanned vehicle in the "Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge of China" prove its reliability and accuracy.
