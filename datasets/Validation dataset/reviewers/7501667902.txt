0000114701	Volume phase transition of spherical microgel particles	The volume phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) spherical microgel particles was studied by static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). The results were compared with the coil-to-globule transition of individual long linear PNIPAM chains. The microgel particles have a higher transition temperature, but a less sharp phase transition, in comparison with that of long linear chains. This difference has been attributed to both the short length and the broad length distribution of the subchains inside the microgels. A combination of static and dynamic LLS results revealed that even in a highly collapsed state the microgel particles retained ∼70% of water and the density of the microgel networks increased from 0.021 g/cm

0000171290	The aggregation of trichosanthin in aqueous solution	As a kind of cytotoxin extracted from the root tuber of Trichosanthes kirilowii Maxim (Cucurbitaceae), trichosanthin can selectively bind to and kill the placental trophoblastic cells, which leads to a number of biomedical applications including the inhibition of trophoblastic tumors. However, the stability of trichosanthin in living organism is still one of the problems hindering the effectiveness of its applications. In this study, laser light scattering has been used successfully to investigate the stability of trichosanthin in both deionized water and KSCN aqueous solution in terms of the hydrodynamic size distribution of the trichosanthin aggregates as a function of both time and the salt concentration. It is found that the size distribution is always a bimodal one. One peak corresponds to a single trichosanthin chain; the other corresponds to the trichosanthin aggregates, which have an average hydrodynamic radius of ∼ 49 nm and are composed of ∼ 127 trichosanthin molecules when C

0000335614	Poly(1,1′-bi-2-naphthol)s: Synthesis, characterization, and application in Lewis acid catalysis	6,6′-Dibromo-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol derivatives, where the hydroxyl groups are protected by alkyl, methoxymethyl, and acyl groups, have been polymerized using nickel(0) or nickel(II) complexes as catalysts. The molecular weights of the resulting polymers have been analyzed by gel permeation chromatography and laser light scattering. Hydrolysis of these polymers has produced the optically active poly(1,1′-bi-2-naphthol)s [poly(BINOL)s]. The poly(BINOL)s are soluble in basic water solution and have been characterized by NMR, IR, UV, and CD spectroscopic methods. The reaction of a (R)-poly(BINOL) with diethylaluminum chloride, trimethylaluminum, and titanium tetraisopropoxide generates novel polymeric Lewis acid complexes. These complexes represent a new generation of polymeric catalysts where the catalytic centers are highly organized in an optically active and sterically regular polymer chain. When used to catalyze the Mukaiyama aldol condensation, the polymeric aluminum catalyst shows greatly enhanced catalytic activity over the monomeric complex.

0030105979	A light-scattering study of the aggregation behavior of fluorocarbon-modified polyacrylamides in water	Fluorocarbon-modified polyacrylamide chains can form large multichain aggregates. The aggregation behavior of a series of fluorocarbon-modified polyacrylamides in water has been investigated by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) was estimated from the emergence of a second peak in the line-width distribution measured in dynamic LLS. Our results showed that CAC strongly depends on the amount of 2-(N-ethylperfluorooctanesulfonamido)ethyl acrylate (FX-13) copolymerized with polyacrylamide and also on the polymer concentration. When the FX-13 content is 0.227 mol %, CAC is as low as 1.34 × 10

0012843681	Interactions in mixtures of a microemulsion and a polymer	We have studied the phase behavior of mixtures of a microemulsion and a nonadsorbing polymer. With a virial expansion we calculated the phase boundary curve of the mixture using an effective interaction potential, which includes both the polymer-induced depletion attraction and the square-well attraction between the bare microemulsion droplets. The calculated phase boundary curve fits the phase measurements well. The fitted values of the interaction parameters for the square-well attraction are found to be in good agreement with the previous neutron and light scattering results. The experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of using a polymer to probe the microscopic interactions in microemulsions and other non-hard-sphere colloidal suspensions. © 1997 The American Physical Society.

0030190183	Effects of surfactants on the phase transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water	The effects of both anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and cationic (dodecylpyridine bromide, DPB) surfactants on the phase transition of narrowly distributed poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel particles were investigated by laser light scattering. The addition of SDS swells the particles and increases the phase transition temperature, while DPB has a much smaller effect. This difference cannot be due to an association between the surfactant hydrophobic tail and PNIPAM because DPB and SDS have an identical hydrophobic tail. The amide groups in PNIPAM are slightly protonized in deionized water (pH approx. 5.5). Our results contradict a previous prediction that oppositely charged surfactants will collapse a polyelectrolyte gel. After adding SDS, a two-step phase transition of the PNIPAM gel is observed. This suggests that SDS forms micelles inside the microgel with the help of the immobilized counter ions on the gel network. The SDS micelles are broken into individual SDS molecules in the first step of phase transition, while in the second step individual SDS molecules are gradually expelled. Surfactant effects on the microgel particles are compared with those of individual PNIPAM chains.

0030192870	In-situ interferometry studies of the drying and swelling kinetics of an ultrathin poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gel film below and above its volume phase transition temperature	The temperature influence on the drying and swelling kinetics of ultrathin poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) gel film were studied by in-situ interferometry. The drying rate is greatly dependent on temperature. When T ≲ 31 °C, the original gel film was swollen and contained more than 99% of water before drying. Our results showed that the initial drying rate was a constant. However, it became faster and faster toward the end of the drying. On the other hand, when T ≳ 2; 32 °C, the gel film was in the collapsed state, but still contained ≃70% of water, before drying. Three distinct drying processes were observed, namely, a very fast initial shrinking, a slow transition period, and a normal drying process similar to that of the gel film when T ≲ 31 °C. As for the swelling process, it can be better described by the first-order kinetics developed by Li and Tanaka. The cooperative diffusion coefficient and the ratio of the shear modulus to the longitudinal modulus were determined from a least-squares fitting of the swelling experimental data according to the swelling equation for a large disk. A critical slowing down of the gel swelling for the thin film was observed in the range of 33-35 °C.

0030196469	Light-scattering studies of styrene-(ethylene-co-butylene)-styrene triblock copolymer and its sulfonated ionomers in tetrahydrofuran	A combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS) was used to study a styrene-(ethylene-co-butylene)-styrene triblock copolymer (SEBS) and its sulfonated ionomers in THF at 25°C. We found that the SEBS solution unexpectedly contained a small amount of clusters whose dissolution in THF is an extremely slow process. On average, each initial SEBS aggregate contains 15-20 individual SEBS chains. As for the SEBS ionomers, the solutions contained species much larger than individual sulfonated SEBS chains. This study revealed that these large species can very slowly dissolve in THF and the dissolution process follows a first-order kinetics. Moreover, we found that the solubility of sulfonated SEBS ionomers decreased with increasing storage time even when the solids were under sealed and dry conditions. These results suggest that the origin of "association of sulfonated SEBS ionomers¥ should be reconsidered; namely, these large species were not formed from individual chains in solution, but instead were fragments produced in the dissolution process. In addition, the study of the complexation of sulfonated SEBS ionomers respectively with poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) (PSVP) and poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-vinylpyridine) (PMMAVP) snowed a maximum (in terms of the size or amount of the formed complexes or viscosity) at an equimolar condition, no matter what kind of metal counterions were used. This suggests a complexation mechanism different from coordination between small molecules.

The collapse transition for polystyrene in cyclohexane can be achieved kinetically by crossing the coexistence curve from the one-phase region to the two-phase region at finite concentrations, while that for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) in water can be achieved under equilibrium conditions which permit experimental determinations of not only the hydrodynamic radius of the collapsed globule, but also its radius of gyration. It is noted that the collapsed globule of either system still contains large amounts of solvent.

0030778160	Complexation of SEBS-based ionomers with pyridine-unit-containing copolymers in solution and bulk	This paper studies complexation behaviour between block ionomers with metal sulfonate groups and pyridine-group-containing copolymers, i.e. poly(styrene-co-4-vinyl pyridine) (STVP) and poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-vinyl pyridine) (MVP) in both solution and bulk. The block ionomers based on poly(styrene-b-ethylene-co-butene-b-styrene) (SEBS) with metal sulfonate groups were prepared by sulfonation of SEBS followed by neutralization. In the blend solutions in tetrahydrofuran, intercomponent complexation is evidenced by an unusual increase in the reduced viscosity relative to the solutions of SEBS and the copolymers. This complexation was observed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements to take place at concentrations as low as 0.01 gdl

0030821084	A new class of chiral conjugated polymers with a propeller-like structure	A new class of chiral conjugated materials, "propeller" polymers, have been designed and synthesized. By using the transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions including the coupling of terminal alkynes with aryl halides and the Suzuki reaction, chiral binaphthyl monomers are reacted with o-phenylene and m-phenylene halides to construct the "propeller" polymers. Due to the chirality of the binaphthyl units and the rigidity of the conjugated system, the dipole units in these novel materials are expected to form a novel propeller-like three-dimensional configuration. Molecular weights of these polymers are analyzed by gel permeation chromatography and laser light scattering. The structures of these polymers are studied by using NMR, UV, IR, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopic methods. The repeat units of these materials are synthesized which provide further evidence for the structure of the polymers. The thermal properties of these polymers are studied by using thermal gravimetric analysis as well as differential scanning calorimetry.

0031079211	Volume phase transition of swollen gels: Discontinuous or continuous?	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) linear chains and spherical microgels were studied using laser light scattering. The volume change associated with the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic radii of both the linear chains and the spherical microgels is continuous, in contrast to a discontinuous volume phase transition observed for a bulk PNIPAM gel with an identical composition. A reexamination of the volume phase transition theory shows that the phase transition temperature depends on the length of the subchain between two neighboring cross-linking points inside the gel. A comparison of the results of the linear chains and the spherical microgels suggests that the volume change of a polymer gel should be practically continuous because the inhomogeneity of the subchain length smears the volume phase transition. A possible explanation is also presented to rationalize the discontinuous volume phase transition observed in certain bulk PNIPAM gels, which is based on the bulk shear module of the gel and the microscopically inhomogeneous shrinking generated inside the gel in the volume phase transition.

0031118729	Light-scattering characterization of the molecular weight distributions of some intractable polymers	Recent developments of using laser light scattering (LLS) to characterize the molecular weight distribution f(M) of special polymers such as Kevlar, Tefzel, Teflon, branched epoxy clusters, gelatin, dextran, segment copolymers and polymer mixtures, are reviewed. The basic principle of combining static (classic) and dynamic LLS results is outlined. In dynamic LLS, the line-width (or the translational diffusion coefficient) distribution G(Γ) can be obtained from the precisely measured intensity-intensity time correlation function. The key problem is transforming G(Γ) to a corresponding molecular weight distribution f(M) is to establish a calibration between D (the translational diffusion coefficient) and M. Typical examples were used to illustrate different calibration methods, including the methods of using a series of narrowly distributed polymer standards with different molecular weights, using two or more broadly distributed polymer samples, and one broadly distributed polymer samples plus an additional experimental method (e.g. viscometry or size exclusion chromatography). The advantages and disadvantages of the LLS method are discussed by comparison with size exclusion chromatography. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

0031119827	Intermacromolecular complexation due to specifie interactions 4. The hydrogen-bonding complex of vinylphenol-containing copolymer and vinylpyridine-containing copolymer	The complexation of poly(styrene-co-vinylphenol) (STVPh) and poly(styrene-co-vinylpyridine) (STVPy) in nonaqueous solution was investigated with emphasis on the effect of the hydroxyl and pyridyl contents in the component polymers. Viscometry, nonradiative energy transfer fluorospectroscopy, and dynamic laser light scattering have led to the same conclusion, i.e., STVPh and STVPy blend can form an interpolymer complex due to hydrogen bonding in tetrahydrofuran, butanone, and chloroform, provided the contents of the hydroxyl and pyridyl reach certain respective levels. The size distribution of the complex aggregates is relatively narrow with a peak size 1 order of magnitude larger than those of the component polymer coils. The minimum content of the interaction groups required for complexation strongly depends on the solvent used. Chloroform and butanone are almost inert for hydrogen bonding between the polymers, tetrahydrofuran has a substantial influence on complexation, and addition of N,N-dimethylformamide into the dispersion of complex aggregates in THF even causes decomplexation.

0031185488	Fluorescence and light-scattering studies on the formation of stable colloidal nanoparticles made of sodium sulfonated polystyrene ionomers	The lightly sulfonated polystyrene ionomer is only soluble in some organic solvents, such as toluene and tetrahydrofurnan (THF). The mixture of its organic solution with water normally leads to macroscopic phase separation, namely precipitation. In this study, using the steady-state fluorescence, the nonradiative energy transfer and dynamic laser light scattering, we demonstrate that the sulfonated polystyrene ionomers can form stable colloidal nanoparticles if the THF solution of the ionomers is dropwisely added into an excessive amount of water, or vice verse, water is added in a dropwise fashion into the dilute ionomer THF solution under ultrasonification or fast stirring. The hydrophobic core made of the polystyrene backbone chains is stabilized by the ionic groups on the particle surface. Such formed stable nanoparticles have a relatively narrow size distribution with an average diameter in the range of 5-12 nm, depending on the degree of sulfonation, the initial concentration of the ionomer THF solution, and the mixing order. This study shows another way to prepare surfac-tant-free polystyrene nanoparticles. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

0031548658	Inter- and intrachain associations of an ethylene-vinyl acetate random copolymer in dilute 1,2-dichloroethane solutions	Laser light scattering (LLS) has been used to study an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) random copolymer in 1.2-dichloroethane. The EVA solution was treated using two different thermal processes: (1) quickly quenching from 70 °C to °C; and (2) slowly cooling from 70 °C to room temperature and annealing at room temperature for 24 h before further quenching to 0 °C. The LLS results reveal the formation of larger EVA aggregates in both of the thermal processes. After the EVA solution was reheated from 0 °C to a higher temperature, we found that the size of the EVA aggregates formed in the fast cooling process is nearly independent of temperature in the range of 15-30 °C, but the size of the EVA aggregates formed in the slow cooling process increases and reaches a maximum in the same temperature range. In both of the cases, the EVA aggregates dissociate at higher temperatures The formation kinetics of the EVA aggregates at 40 °C and the effect of the annealing time at room temperature were also investigated. All results lead us to realize that in the fast cooling process the EVA aggregates were formed mostly through the aggregation (packing) of individual EVA collapsed chains (intrachain aggregation ), while in the slow cooling process, the EVA aggregates are microgel-like particles formed through the winding of the EVA chains (interchain association). We also found that there is a good correlation between the size of the EVA aggregates and the pour point of a wax solution doped with EVA.

0031551687	The "coil-to-globule" transition of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) on the surface of a surfactant-free polystyrene nanoparticle	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) adsorbed on surfactant-free polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles has been studied by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). In static LLS, the amount of PNIPAM adsorbed on the nanoparticles was determined from the absolute excess scattered intensity; and in dynamic LLS, the temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticles adsorbed with PNIPAM was monitored to reveal the "coil-to-globule" transition of PNIPAM on the particle surface. We found that the amount of PNIPAM adsorbed on the nanoparticles depends not only on the PNIPAM concentration but also on the highest temperature to which the nanoparticles/ PNIPAM mixture was heated. Near the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM in water, the collapse of the adsorbed chains leads to an additional adsorption of PNIPAM on the surface. For a given temperature below the LCST, as the amount of the adsorbed PNIPAM increases, the thickness of the adsorbed PNIPAM layer increases, but the average density of the adsorbed PNIPAM layer decreases, suggesting an extension of the adsorbed chains. Moreover, our results indicate that the adsorbed chains have a lower LCST than the PNIPAM chains free in water.

0031556465	Complexation between poly(styrene-co-4-vinylphenol) and poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) in solution	Complexation between poly(styrene-co-4-vinylphenol) (STVPh) and poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) (STVPy) in solution has been studied by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. It was found that the Complexation was strongly influenced by the phenol and pyridyl contents and the solvent used. In a stronger proton-acceptor solvent, the Complexation only happens when the phenol and pyridyl contents are higher than a certain value, indicating a competition between the formation of the polymer-polymer and polymer-solvent hydrogen bonding. The addition of water, a strong hydrogen-bonding solvent, can completely destroy the Complexation, clearly showing that it is the hydrogen bonding that induces the Complexation. When the molar ratio of the monomer units of STVPh to STVPy is ∼1:1, the scattering intensity reaches a maximum, indicating that the Complexation has a 1:1 stoichiometry. On the other hand, when STVPy was in excess in the solution mixture, each STVPh chain is complexed with a certain number of the STVPy chains over a wide range of composition and vice versa, suggesting the Complexation is sterically governed.

0031559737	Intermacromolecular complexation due to specific interactions. 5. The hydrogen-bonding complex of poly(styrene-co-4-vinylphenol) and poly(ethyl methacrylate)	The complexation between poly(styrene-co-4-vinylphenol) (STVPh) and poly(ethyl methacrylate) (PEMA) due to hydrogen bonding in nonaqueous media was investigated by viscometry, laser light scattering (LLS), and nonradiative energy-transfer (NRET) fluorospectroscopy. The formation of STVPh/PEMA complexes in solutions strongly depends on the hydroxyl content in STVPh and the solvent used. The minimum OH content in STVPh required to form interpolymer complex aggregates is 9 mol % in toluene and 22 mol % in 1-nitropropane. Such a large difference can be attributed to the two solvents having different abilities of accepting protons. Complete decomplexation of the STVPh/PEMA complexes in toluene can be realized by adding a small amount of tetrahydrofuran. LLS experiments reveal that the size of the complex aggregates depends on the blend composition and is a maximum at 1:1 base ratio. In addition, a new modified NRET procedure to monitor the interpolymer complexation is proposed in this paper.

The interchain association increases as both the fluorocarbon content and polymer concentration increase, evidenced by the changes of the apparent molar mass, intrinsic viscosity, Huggins constant, and fluorescence excimer-to-monomer intensity ratio. The LLS results are well-represented by the open association model. Our results also revealed that the intrachain association starts when each polymer chain, on average, has more than two fluorocarbon monomers.

In spite of the large difference in their ionic contents, both the ionomers have a nearly same lower critical solution temperature (LCST, ∼ 32.5°C). At temperatures higher than the LCST, the ionomer chains undergo a simultaneous intrachain coil-to-globule transition and interchain aggregation to form nanoparticles thermodynamically stable in water.

It was observed that the concentration of MMA, casein, and the ratio of MMA to casein had a prominent effect on the final conversion and graft ratio, while the concentration of copper(II) ion almost had no effect. The graft polymerization was much slower at 60°C than at 70°C. Further increase of reaction temperature from 70°C to 80°C enhanced only the initial conversion. Kinetic study of the graft copolymerization at 70°C indicated that the reaction proceeded through two stages which were typical kinetic behavior for the radical polymerization confined in a pre-formed micro-environment. Finally, the particle size of the casein-g-PMMA latexes decreased with the increase of percent grafting, and an almost linear relationship between the particle size and the percent grafting was evident.

A convenient method of producing ultrafine poly(methylstyrene) latexes with aldehyde groups on the surface	A convenient method of preparing ultrafine poly(methylstyrene) (PMS) latex particles with aldehyde groups on the surface is developed. PMS latexes in the size range 33-81 nm were prepared via microemulsion polymerization, using cetyltri-methylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant. The surface of the PMS latexes was oxidized in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide catalyzed by copper(II) chloride. As the degree of oxidation increased up to 6 h, the amounts of aldehyde group increased. Bigger particles were found to have a slightly higher rate of oxidation than small ones under the same oxidation conditions. The particle size underwent little change during oxidation; thus, the amounts of functional groups and the particle size could be controlled concurrently. Dialysis study of the oxidized PMS microlatexes indicated that the instability of highly oxidized PMS microlatexes was caused by the reduction of total surface charge density due to the presence of carboxylic acid groups. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Miscibility and Complexation between Poly{Styrene-co-[p-(2-Hydroxypropan-2-yl)Styrene]} and Poly[n-butyl Methacrylate-co(4-vinylpyridine)]	In recent years, considerable attention has been focused on polymer miscibility and complexation due to hydrogen bonding. Monodisperse, proton-donating polystyrene (PS), that is, poly{styrene-co-[p-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)styrene]} [PS(t-OH)], was synthesized via chemical modification of polystyrene.

In organic solutions of PS(t-OH)/BVPy blends, viscometry was employed to study the complexation behavior. Solvents with different proton-accepting abilities were used and hence proved to exert distinctive effects on solution complexation. In very dilute solutions, the complex aggregate was observed by static and dynamic light scattering (LS).

A combination of kinetics and molecular weight distribution studies revealed that the polymerization followed the micellization nucleation mechanism. Results showed that an appropriate initiator concentration was necessary to obtain monodisperse and stable latex particles. Conversion of methylstyrene was found to increase significantly with increasing initiator concentrations. However, the size of PMS latex particles decreased with both the increase of initiator concentration and the reaction temperature at a constant ionic strength. The particle size was increased as the ionic strength of the aqueous phase increased, yet the variation of ionic strength had little effect on the particle size distribution. SEM micrographs showed that an agitation rate of 350 rpm or higher was required in order to produce highly monodispersed poly(methylstyrene) latex particles.

A laser light scattering study showed that the lower association temperature and higher PNIPAM concentration resulted in larger low density interchain aggregates with a cluster structure, while the higher association temperature and lower PNIPAM concentration led to spherical aggregates formed mainly through the packing of individual collapsed chains. Above approx. 32°C, the intrachain coil-to-globule transition competes with the interchain association. Gelatin was encaptured/complexed into the PNIPAM aggregates and the complexation was completely reversible as the temperature varied. The PNIPAM/gelatin complexes with the highest molar mass and density were formed when the PNIPAM/gelatin weight ratio was in the range 1-2 and the temperature was close to approx. 32°C.

The hybrid nanoparticles consist of gold core, cross-linkable poly (2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMA) inner shell, and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) corona. First, diblock copolymer PEO-b-PDMA was prepared via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) technique using a PEO-based macroRAFT agent. The dithioester end group of PEO-b-PDMA diblock copolymer was reduced to a thiol end group.

27744509071	The observation of first order transition in ultra-filtration of flexible linear polymer chains	By using a special double-layer membrane to avoid interaction among flowing fields in different pores, the theoretically predicted discontinues transition in ultra-filtration of flexible linear polymer chains was observed for the first time. Namely, the chains could pass through pores with sizes much smaller than the chain's unperturbed radius when the flow rate is higher than a threshold. In theory, such a threshold is independent of both the chain length and the pore size. However, we found that when the macroscopic flow rate was lower than the threshold, some of the pores were blocked by a fraction of longer polymer chains. Therefore, the microscopic flow rate in the non-blocked pores became higher than the threshold so that the rest of the chains could pass through these non-blocked pores. This leads to an apparent separation of the chains with different lengths.

3242744491	"Chemically shielded" poly(ethylene oxide) single crystal growth and construction of channel-wire arrays with chemical and geometric recognitions on a submicrometer scale	The generation of nucleation sites for crystal growth of homo-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) fraction in solution by series of PEO-block-polystyrene (PEO-b-PS) was analyzed. A 'sandwich' lamellar structure which was constructed by PEO single crystal covered by two tethered PS block layers on top and bottom crystal basal surfaces was also observed. The repulsion generated among tethered PS blocks caused PS blocks located near and at edges to advance along [120] direction. The results show that novel channel-wire arrays on submicrometer length scale having chemical and geometric recognitions could be fabricated via alternating crystal growth of PEO-b-PS and homo-PEO.

32644455294	First observation of two-stage collapsing kinetics of a single synthetic polymer chain	Using a narrowly distributed poly(N-isoporpylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) chain with a degree of polymerization (N) of 3100, randomly labeled with pyrene, we have, for the first time, observed the two-stage kinetics of the coil-to-globule transition. Two characteristic relaxation times, τfast for the crumpling of a random coil (∼12ms) and τslow for the collapsing of the crumpled chain to a compact globule (∼270ms), were measured. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence supporting the two-stage collapsing kinetics of single synthetic polymer chain previously proposed by de Gennes, Dawson, and Grosberg. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33745047536	Observation of the first-order transition in ultrafiltration of flexible linear polymer chains	Using a special double-layer membrane to avoid interaction among flow fields generated by different pores, we have, for the first time, observed the predicted discontinuous first-order transition in ultrafiltration of flexible linear polymer chains. Namely, the chain could pass through a pore much smaller than its unperturbed radius only when the flow rate is higher than a certain value. When only one chain and one pore are considered in theory, such a threshold is surprisingly independent of both the chain length and the pore size. Our results reveal that for a membrane with many pores and at a microscopic flow rate (q) lower than the threshold, the inevitable blocking of some pores by longer nonstretched coiled chains increases q in those unblocked pores because the macroscopic flow rate (Q) is a constant. Long chains have two populations, coiled and stretched, in a real ultrafiltration experiment when q is lower than the threshold. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

33744829483	Phase transition behavior of unimolecular micelles with thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) coronas	This paper describes the double phase transition behavior of a thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brush at the surface of a hydrophobic core. Reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was conducted by using a hyperbranched polyester (Boltorn H40) based macroRAFT agent. The resultant multiarm star block copolymer (H40-PNIPAM) exists as unimolecular micelles with hydrophobic H40 as the core, densely grafted PNIPAM brush as the shell. A combination of laser light scattering (LLS) and microdifferential scanning calorimetry (micro-DSC) studies of H40-PNIPAM in aqueous solution reveals double phase transitions of the PNIPAM corona, which is in contrast to the fact that free PNIPAM homopolymer in aqueous solution exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) at ∼32 °C. The first phase transition takes place in the broad temperature range 20-30 °C, which can be tentatively ascribed to the n-cluster-induced collapse,of the inner region of the PNIPAM brush close to the H40 core; the second phase transition occurs above 30 °C, which can be ascribed to the outer region of PNIPAM brush. Employing the RAFT chain extension technique, the inner and outer part of PNIPAM brush were then selectively labeled with pyrene derivatives, respectively; temperature-dependent excimer fluorescence measurements further support the conclusion that the inner part of PNIPAM brush collapses first at lower temperatures, followed by the collapse of the outer part at higher temperatures. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33746383046	A stopped-flow kinetic study of the assembly of interpolymer complexes via hydrogen-bonding interactions	The formation of soluble interpolymer complexes from poly(4-vinylphenol-g-styrene) (PVPh-g-PS) and poly(styrene-co-4-vinylpyridine) (STVPy) via hydrogen-bonding interactions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) was investigated with viscometry, laser light scattering (LLS), and stopped-flow light scattering. Upon mixing PVPh-g-PS with STVPy solutions in THF, colloidally stable dispersions are obtained, indicating the formation of core-shell structure with the core consisting of hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complexes between PVPh backbone and STVPy and the shell of PS grafts. Both LLS and viscometry results reveal that the complexation between PVPh-g-PS and STVPy proceeds stoichiometrically. Reduced viscosities of PVPh-g-PS/STVPy-49 and PVPh-g-PS/STVPy-74 mixed solutions exhibit minima at weight fractions of PVPh-g-PS ∼ 0.5 and 0.6, respectively. At these compositions the interpolymer complexes micelles have the highest scattering light intensities and average densities, 〈ρ〉.

The length scale of the slow relaxation was found to be comparable with the observation length (1/q) in our DLS measurements. To elucidate its origin, we varied the solution temperature and used different salts to study their effects on such a slow mode because it is known that they can influence the strength of the water-amide hydrogen bonding as well as the icelike structure of liquid water. As the temperature increases, the slow mode was gradually suppressed. Using a strong salting-out salt (Na

33846350192	Folding and formation of mesoglobules in dilute copolymer solutions	It is known that linear homopolymer chains can undergo a coil-to-globule-to-precipitation transition when the solvent quality gradually changes from good to poor. It is also known that the observation of the coil-to-globule transition without any interchain association is extremely difficult if not impossible. On the other hand, the folding of individual amphiphilic copolymer chains, such as protein chains, in an extremely dilute solution is much easier. As the copolymer concentration increases, inevitable interchain association accompanied by intrachain folding can result in a stable mesoglobular phase (the aggregation of a limited number of chains), existing between single-chain globules and macroscopic phase separation (precipitation). In this article, we mainly review what we have accomplished in the last ten years by starting with a brief discussion of the folding of linear poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) homopolymer chains in water. Our focus is the folding of different hydrophilically or hydrophobically modified PNIPAM copolymer chains in extremely dilute solutions as well as the formation of stable mesoglobules made of amphiphilic copolymer chains in dilute solutions. The discoveries of the molten globular state and the "ordered-coil" state between the random-coil and compacted globular states will be illustrated. The effects of both the comonomer composition and distribution on the folding of individual copolymer chains into some unique core-shell nanostructures as well as the formation of the mesoglobular phase are discussed. The double roles of hydrophobic interaction in the formation and stabilization of stable mesoglobules will be explained in terms of the viscoelastic effect. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

The enzymatic biodegradation of the PCL portion of these particles in water was in situ investigated inside a recently developed novel differential refractometer. Using this refractometry method, we were able to monitor the real-time biodegradation via the refractive index change (Δn) of the dispersion because Δn is directly proportional to the particle mass concentration. We found that the degradation rate is proportional to either the polymer or enzyme concentration. Our results directly support previous speculation on the basis of the light-scattering data that the biodegradation follows the first-order kinetics for a given enzyme concentration. This study not only leads to a better understanding of the enzymatic biodegradation of PCL, but also demonstrates a novel, rapid, noninvasive, and convenient way to test the degradability of polymers. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

34547456618	How many Stages in the coil-to-globule transition of linear homopolymer chains in a dilute solution?	Coil-to-globule transition of individual linear poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) homopolymer chains in dilute solutions have two distinct kinematic stages with two characteristic transition times. This was done by using a combination of a fast infrared laser heating-pulse induced temperature jump and the time-dependent fluorescence and Rayleigh scattering intensity measurement. The chain-length independent first stage can be attributed to the nucleation and initial growth of some locally contracting segments, while the second and relatively slower process is related to the merging and coarsening of the locally contracting segments. No distinction either between the nucleation and initial growth of the locally contracting segments or between the packaging and merging of the locally contracting segments have been found.

34548235804	Diffusion of long chains through a porous thin gel network	Using a core (142 nm) made of linear polystyrene (PS) chains as a seed, we further polymerized a thin layer of cross-linked PS shell (7 nm) on. it in water to form a core-shell particle. Such a particle swells in toluene, which enables linear PS chains inside the core to gradually diffuse out through the porous shell. Using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering, we examined the chain diffusion process by following the change of the scattering intensity (i.e. the average molar mass of the particles). For the first time, we have revealed that the diffusion exhibits three stages. In the first stage, the chain diffusion through the shell is even faster than their translational diffusion in a dilute solution. The three stages respectively correspond to the change of the solution in the core from concentrated to semidilute and then from semidilute to dilute. © 2007 World Scientific.

35148832152	Ultrafast infrared heating laser pulse-induced micellization kinetics of polyethylene oxide-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) in water	The heating-induced micellization of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (Pluronic PE10300) triblock copolymer chains was studied by ultrasensitive differential scanning calorimetry, laser light scattering, and fluorescence spectrometry with a fluorescent probe, 8-anilino-l-naphthalenesulfonic acid ammonium salt. The critical micellization temperatures obtained from the three methods are similar. The micellization kinetics was studied in terms of changes in the fluorescence and Rayleigh scattering intensities after an ultrafast infrared heating laser pulse (-10 ns)-induced temperature jump. The increases in the fluorescence and Rayleigh scattering intensities in the millisecond range can be well described by a single-exponential equation, corresponding to the incorporation of individual triblock copolymer chains (unimers) into large spherical micelles. The increase in copolymer concentration or the initial solution temperature decreases the characteristic transition time. In general, the fluorescence measurement has a better signal-to-noise ratio but leads to a transition time that is slightly shorter than that from the corresponding Rayleigh scattering measurement for a given copolymer solution. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

34748921199	Self-assembly and optical property of triblock copolymers made of polystyrene and oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) in different mixtures of toluene and hexane	Using a combination of laser light scattering (LLS), UV-vis, and fluorescence spectrometry methods, we comparatively examined the self-assembly and optical property of two triblock copolymers made of polystyrene (PS, coillike) and oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) (OPE, rodlike) in different mixtures of toluene and hexane. For the coil-rod-coil (PS-OPE-PS) triblock copolymer, intrachain wrapping of the two soluble PS coil blocks on the insoluble middle OPE rod block in the solvent mixture reduces the π-π stacking of OPE and makes it more planar, resulting in a red shift in its UV-vis and fluorescence spectra, presumably, due to the J-type aggregation. While for the rod-coil-rod (OPE-PS-OPE) triblock copolymer, two intrachain stacked insoluble OPE blocks are wrapped and stabilized by the soluble middle PS block in toluene. The addition of hexane, a nonsolvent of PS, leads to further interchain aggregation of OPE, resulting in large polymeric micelles with an insoluble OPE core and a soluble PS shell. The blue shift in its UV-vis and fluorescence spectra reflects that intrachain stacking and interchain packing of OPE in the core are mainly H-type; i.e., they are parallel to each other, which increases the π-π interaction of OPE. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

The effect of both anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and cationic (N-dodecylpyridinium bromide, DPB) surfactants on the swelling and shrinking of the microgels were investigated by laser light scattering (LLS). Our results showed that the microgels gradually shrank to the collapsed state when the temperature increased from 20 to approx. 38°C. The addition of anionic surfactant caused an extra swelling of the microgels and shifted the collapsing temperature higher, whereas the addition of cationic surfactant has different effects on the swelling and shrinking of the microgels prepared by using different initiators, depending on whether the decomposed fragments of the initiator are ionic or neutral. Our results clearly showed that the ionic groups introduced into polymer gels from the initiators should be taken into consideration in the study of the surfactant/gel interaction.

The complexation of modified polystyrene [PS(OH)] and polycaprolactone in solutions	Complexation-between hydroxyl containing polystyrene (PS), i.e., PS(OH) and polycaprolactone (PCL) by hydrogen bonding in solutions was studied by viscometry and laser light scattering. Formation of the complex strongly depended on hydroxyl content in PS(OH) in solution. In toluene, polymer coils existed independently when hydroxyl content in PS(OH) was less than 5 mol% while components formed complexes when hydroxyl content reached 8 mol%. No complexation was found in tetrahydrofuran (THF) even when hydroxyl content went up to 20 mol%. A combination of dynamic and static light scattering showed that in toluene solution.

Using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS), we characterized the resultant nanoparticles and studied their biodegradation in the presence of enzyme lipase PS. The results revealed that the biodegradation rate was mainly dependent on the enzyme concentration. The scattering intensity decreased as the degradation proceeded, but there was no change in size of the remaining nanoparticles, indicating that the degradation of each particle was fast and the enzyme consumed the nanoparticles individually. We also found that different copolymer compositions, i.e., different PCL-PEO molar ratios, led to different biodegradation rates. The pH and temperature dependence of the biodegradation rate were also studied. All results indicated that the biodegradation rate can be well controlled and the biodegradation essentially involves two processes: adsorption of lipase PS onto the nanoparticles, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the PCL blocks. The biomedical application of the enzymatic biodegradation of the copolymer nanoparticles is also envisioned.

Purification of the latexes by dialysis was followed in order to remove residual monomer, initiator and electrolytes. The cationic poly(methylstyrene) latexes were then oxidized in the presence of t-butyl hydroperoxide catalyzed by copper chloride at 60°C under air. The degree of oxidation increased with reaction time, but the emulsions of highly oxidized poly(methylstyrene) latexes were found to be unstable. An increase of oxidant concentration enhanced the rate of oxidation, while the catalyst concentration had little influence on it. The effect of reaction temperature and pH value on the catalytic oxidation of poly(methylstyrene) latexes was also investigated.

Both the nanoparticles and the polystyrene chains inside the nanoparticles were characterized by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). We also found that various surfactant-free polymeric nanoparticles could be made by microphase inversion; namely, the addition of a polymer solution dropwise into an excess of water or the temperature-induced phase transition. We proposed a stabilization mechanism and experimentally demonstrated that for a given stable dispersion the average surface area (s) occupied per stabilizer is a constant. On the basis of this mechanism, we were able to propose a structural model to control and predict the resultant particle size from the macroscopic monomer/stabilizer weight ratio. We also successfully used the nanoparticles in the studies of enzymatic biodegradation and controllable chemical releasing.

The hydrogen bonding between polystyrene-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA) and poly{styrene-co-[p-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-trifluoromethyl) ethyl-α-methylstyrene]} (PS(OH)) in toluene led to a stable core - shell structure with the core and shell, respectively, made of the insoluble PMMA/PS(OH) complexes and the soluble PS blocks as long as the p-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxy-1-trifluoromethyl)ethyl-α-methylstyrene (HFMS) content of PS(OH) is higher than 8 mol %. Laser light scattering studies found that the molar mass and the core density of the complex micelles increased, but the size decreased as the HFMS content increased. The complexation-induced micelles were very stable, as dilution had almost no effect on them. However, both the size and molar mass of the complex micelles increased as the initial polymer concentration increased, indicating that the complexation was a diffusion-controlled process and the micellization process may not reach thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, fluorescence and viscometry measurements further supported the concept of formation of hydrogen bonding complex micelles and their dependence on HFMS content in PS(OH).

Our investigation of the effect of oxidant concentration, reaction time, and temperature demonstrated that controlling the surface concentration of aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups was readily accomplished by altering these three reaction parameters. The concentration of the catalyst, however, was found to have little affect on the rate of oxidation. Furthermore, the amounts of surface aldehyde and carboxylic acid groups were determined by conductometric and potentiometric titrations. Electrolyte stability of functionalized latexes was also examined with regard to their critical coagulation concentrations in various salt solutions. Finally, SEM studies were conducted and clearly showed that surface morphology of functional latexes hardly altered with a low degree of oxidation but became aggregates when highly oxidized latexes were formed.

The PCL and enzyme concentration dependence of the biodegradation rate supports a heterogeneous catalytic kinetics in which we have introduced an additional equilibrium between the inactive and active enzyme/substrate complexes. The initial rate equation derived on the basis of this mechanism was used to successfully explain the influence of surfactant, pH and temperature on the enzymatic biodegradation. Our results confirmed that both the adsorption and the enzymatic catalysis were important for the biodegradation of the PCL nanoparticles.

38849083273	Loading quantum dots into thermo-responsive microgels by reversible transfer from organic solvents to water	We describe a new method for the preparation of fluorescent inorganic-nanoparticle composite microgels. Copolymer microgels with functional pendant groups were transferred via dialysis into tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution and mixed with colloidal solutions of semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots, QDs). CdSe QDs stabilized with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) became incorporated into the microgels via ligand exchange of pendant imidazole (Im) groups for TOPO. PbS QDs stabilized with oleic acid were incorporated into microgels with pendant -COOH groups. This approach worked equally well with microgels based upon poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and those based upon an acetoacetylethyl methacrylate-N-vinylcaprolactam copolymer (PVCL). These composite hybrid materials were colloidally stable in THF, and maintained their colloidal stability after transfer to water, either via dialysis or by sedimentation-redispersion. In water, the composites exhibited similar thermal responsiveness to the parent microgels, with a small shift to lower temperature in the volume phase transition. This approach allows one to use inorganic nanoparticles synthesized under optimum conditions in organic media at high temperature and to prepare composite microgels directly by mixing the components in a water-miscible organic solvent. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008.

Our results showed that the self-assembly was controlled by competition between the intrachain contraction and interchain association. There is a delicate balance between thermodynamic and kinetics. Inside the self-assembled micelle-like nanostructure, the polymer chains were in a metastable state and kinetically frozen. The self-assembly resembles the initial stage of surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. The size of the nanostructures was essentially governed by the surface area occupied per ionic end group. A variation of the initial conditions, such as the polymer concentration in THF and DMF, solvent, and counterions, can make either the intrachain contraction or interchain association dominant so that the self-assembly can be tailored.

0034684190	Self-assembled nanostructure of a novel coil-rod diblock copolymer in dilute solution	A novel narrowly distributed rod - coil diblock copolymer, poly(styrene-block-(2,5-bis[4-methoxyphenyl]oxycarbonyl)styrene) (PS-b-PMPCS), was synthesized by 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) mediated living free radical polymerization. The rodlike PMPCS block is a mesogen-jacked liquid crystalline polymer and is soluble in p-xylene at temperatures higher than 100°C. When a PS-b-PMPCS dilute solution is cooled, the copolymer chains can self-assemble into a core - shell nanostructure. The temperature-induced self-assembly was studied. We showed, for the first time, that instead of a neutron scattering, a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering results could also lead to the corn radius (R(c)) and the shell thickness (ΔR). Using this novel method, we found that when more chains were assembled into the nanostructure, R(c) remained as a constant, close to the contour length of the PMPCS block, but the shell became thicker, indicating that the attraction between the insoluble rigid rodlike PMPCS blocks led to their insertion into the core, while the repulsion between the soluble coillike PS blocks forced them to stretch in the shell.

The [-COOH] dependence of the self-assembly of CSEBS in water was investigated by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. The addition of a dilute CSEBS tetrahydrofuran solution dropwise into water leads to a microphase inversion, resulting in surfactant-free polymeric nanoparticles stable in water. As [-COOH] increases, the particle size first decreases and then slightly increases; namely, there exists a minimum in particle size when [-COOH]≈21 mol %.

79951620322	Mapping polymer phase diagram in nanoliter droplets	Microfluidic systems provide an attractive platform to address these two problems by significantly reducing the consumption of reagents and the time for reaching thermal equilibrium. The polymer concentration in each droplet was determined by using fluorescent internal marker. After precisely determining the PNIPAM concentration in each individual droplet, the phase transition of the PNIPAM aqueous solution was detected. The scattered light intensities of each individual droplet at various temperatures were measured by ImageJ (NIH). The droplets containing the PNIPAM solution were separated from the capillary wall by a thin layer of silicone oil. The droplets were about 200 μm in diameter and 550 μm in length and presented large ratio of surface area to volume (S/V). The larger S/V ratio enhanced adsorption of PNIPAM to the water/oil interface, which could change the phase transition behavior and also cause uneven distribution of the scattering light intensity across the droplets.

84861909678	Why RNA and protein chains are linear and not colliding inside nuclear pores	Chain confinement and translocation in and through a small pore is studied to find why RNA and protein chains are linear and not colliding inside nuclear pores. Experimental and theoretical results show that RNA and protein chains are linear. If they were branched, the critical flow rate for them to pass through nuclear pores would be varying for different branching structures and different molar masses, but the thermally agitated motions of a nuclear membrane are passive such that the induced flow rate cannot be automatically adjusted for branched chains with different structures. Studied have also found that there is sufficient time for a linear RNA or protein chain to pass through a nuclear pore completely without being driven back and forth inside a nuclear pore by the breathing motions.

84877701362	Effects of hydrolyzable comonomer and cross-linking on anti-biofouling terpolymer coatings	Antifouling coatings based on the cross-linked terpolymer chains made of methyl methacrylate (MMA), the hydrolyzable tributylsilyl methacrylate (TBSM) or triisopropylsilyl methacrylate (TIPSM) and acrylic acid (AA) were developed. By varying the hydrolyzable monomer content and the cross-linking degree, a set of such prepared coatings were evaluated in terms of their degradation rate, swelling degree, contact angle and antifouling properties. After immersed in seawater, such coatings quickly self-generate a thin and swollen hydrogel layer at the water-contacting surface due to the hydrolysis of the hydrolyzable groups on the surface. Further hydrolysis leads to a gradual degradation and self-peeling of this hydrogel layer. Their antifouling properties were evaluated by both the adsorption of fluorescence-labeled bovine serum albumin and the field-testing in a real marine environment. Our results reveal that it is such a layer-by-layer hydrogel formation and self-peeling process that leads to an excellent antifouling property. Therefore, it is vitally important to delicately balance the hydrogel formation and the self-peeling rate to achieve the best antifouling of such a coating by carefully choosing a proper cross-linking degree and a suitable content and type of the hydrolyzable comonomer. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84897983989	Mapping phase diagrams of polymer solutions by a combination of microfluidic solution droplets and laser light-scattering detection	Conventional mapping of a phase diagram of a polymer in a solvent requires a substantial amount of polymer (e.g., at least of the order of ∼100 mg of narrowly distributed samples with different molar masses) and may take months or even years to reach the true two phase equilibrium at each given temperature, especially when the polymer concentration is high. This is why good phase diagrams of polymer solutions are rare in the literature. To solve such a problem, we developed a Teflon microfluidic device to prepare and store a series of droplets (∼10 nL) at different polymer concentrations inside a glass capillary. The phase transition inside each polymer solution droplet sealed and isolated in immiscible fluorohydrocarbon could be quickly and precisely monitored by a newly developed small angle laser light scattering detector. Using poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) in isobutyl alcohol and in benzene as two examples, we demonstrated that a combination of microfluidic device and small angle light scattering enables us to map the phase diagram of a polymer in a given solvent within hours by using only a few mg of the sample because (1) each droplet contains no more than ∼10 μg polymer and (2) the phase-transition induced interchain association inside each droplet can be quickly and sensitively detected. We have demonstrated that two sets of a total of eight precisely mapped phase diagrams of four PVAc fractions in the two solvents can be reasonably scaled together to form a master curve. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

84907999427	One stone kills three birds: Novel boron-containing vesicles for potential bnct, controlled drug release, and diagnostic imaging	A new conjugate polymer was prepared by an efficient thiol-ene coupling of one carborane with a linear PEG chain (M<inf>n</inf> = 2,000 g/mol), and each carborane was further labeled with a fluorescence rhodamine dye. Such a novel polymer can associate in water to form narrowly distributed spherical vesicles, which were characterized using a range of methods, including laser light scattering, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and TEM. The vesicular structure is potentially multifunctional in biomedical applications, namely, serving as a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) agent, a hydrophilic drug carrier, and a diagnostic imaging fluorescent probe. As expected, either cleaving the thiol-ene linked PEO chain by esterase or destroying carborane by neutron irradiation results in a dismantlement of such a vesicle structure to release its encapsulated drugs. Its potential biomedical applications have been evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary results reveal that these small vesicles can be quickly taken up by cells and have an enhanced stability in the bloodstream so that their targeting to specific cancer cells becomes feasible.

It was also found that there still exists ∼75% of water in the collapsed hydrophobic core which might be useful for biomedical applications because the core-shell nanostructure can be easily switched on and off by a simple temperature variation of 1 - 2°C.

4444320095	Solvent dependence of the evolution of the surface morphology of thin asymmetric diblock copolymer films	The evolution of surface morphology of thin films of asymmetric diblock copolymers with spherical microdomains was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The investigated polymer was poly(styrene-block-2-ferrocenylethyl methacrylate) (PS-b-FEMA), and the molecular weight ratio of PS and FEMA blocks was 7:1. Different solvents were used for film preparation to investigate the solvent influence to surface topography and evolution of the islands. It was found that the effects of solvent used persist after annealing and that the films prepared from different solvents show markedly different surface topographies. Furthermore, the solvent used influences the mechanical adhesion of the film to the substrate, and thusly affects the annealing temperature, which would cause delamination of the film from the substrate. Finally, some recommendations are given on solvent choice and film preparation in order to improve surface quality of the films, which is necessary for successful pattern transfer over a large area. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

4544298190	Erosion induced controllable release of gliclazide encapsulated inside degradable polymeric particles	The microphase inversion of water-insoluble poly(L-lactide), "poly[(L-lactide)-co-glycolide] and polylactide-block-poly(ethylene oxide)-block-porylactide from THF to water can result in narrowly distributed stable particles. Gliclazide, a commercial drug, can be encapsulated inside during the process. The formation and degradation of such particles was studied by laser light scattering. In comparison with the corrosion of a bulk material, the degradation of each particle is so fast that we only detect the decrease of the particle number, not the corrosion of individual particles. Therefore, the degradation is a "one-by-one" random process, just like the chemical reaction of molecules in solution. The disappearing rate of the particle number is nearly independent of time, ideal for the controlled release of drugs encapsulated inside. The amount of encapsulated gliclazide depends on the copolymer's hydrophobicity (composition), while the releasing rate mainly is, directly related to the disappearing rate of the particles. The correlation between the fluorescence intensity and the degradation was used to study the kinetics of gliclazide releasing. The releasing pattern is controllable with a proper choice of the drug loading, copolymer composition, pH and temperature.

47249088340	Comparative study of temperature-induced association of cyclic and linear poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains in dilute solutions by laser light scattering and stopped-flow temperature jump	We have comparatively studied the association of cyclic- and lineor-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (c-PNIPAM and l-PNIPAM) chains with varying chain lengths and end groups in dilute aqueous solutions by laser light scattering (LLS) and stopped-flow temperature-jump measurements. Dynamic and static LLS results reveal that the heating leads to a microphase transition. The resultant structures of interchain aggregates depend on the heating rate and the chain topologies. In comparison with l-PNIPAM chains, a slow heating of c-PNIPAM chains in the solution results in stable mesoglobules with a lower average aggregation number, a looser structure, and a smaller average size (∼290 nm). The temperature-jump-induced association of c-PNIPAM chains in the stopped-flow measurement reveals two kinetic growth stages, which were tentatively ascribed to the loose packing of contracted c-PNIPAM chains and further contraction-induced fragmentation of initially packed c-PNIPAM chains due to the lack of interchain entanglements. On the other hand, for l-PNIPAM chains, the intrachain contraction and interchain penetration/entanglement simultaneously occur as the temperature increases, leading to larger and more compact aggregates whose size increases with the solution temperature. © 2008 American Chemical Society.

The structure and degradation of such formed nanoparticles were investigated by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. Our results revealed that the degradation rate increased with the temperature and pH so that the degradation could be regulated from minutes to days. Using anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as stabilizer resulted in a slower degradation than using cationic hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB). The phthalocyanine chromophores (PC) could be encapsulated inside these PLA nanoparticles. The degradation of individual PLA nanoparticles led to a controllable releasing of PC. The absorption and fluorescence studies revealed a correlation between the degradation and the releasing of PC. Our results showed that a higher PC/PLA ratio could lead to a faster degradation.

The MI-HPG core was synthesized from an amine-functionalized polyglycerol, modified successively with 2-chloropropionamide groups (ATRP initiator) and 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (azo initiator).

The PNIPAM solution was delivered into a nanoliter chamber through the main microchannel. An osmotic pressure difference was established between the chamber and the control microchannel by flowing a high-concentration salt solution in the control micro-channel. Controlled evaporation of water resulted in increasing concentration of PNIPAM. A phase diagram of PNIPAM was built by measuring the cloud points at different concentrations, with a minimum point at «40 wt-%.

The phase separation of PS and P2VP blocks leads to a one-dimensional periodic lamellar structure parallel to the surface of the thin film. In a solvent mixture of water and ethanol, each P2VP layer is swollen and partially charged. Applying a low voltage (<2.5 V) to such a thin film can lead to the repeatable expansion or contraction of each P2VP layer, depending on the direction and strength of the electrical potential. Such a variation of the lamellar periodicity leads to a full color display over a wide range from ultraviolet to near infrared. The advantages of such PCs are their facile preparation, low driving voltage and good durability, which make them potentially useful in information technologies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2009.

The commercially available branched polyethyleneimine (PEI) with a molar mass of 25 kD (PEI-25K) is an effective in vitro vector to transfer genes, but its cytotoxicity limits its applications in bio-related research. To solve such an efficiency-versus-cytotoxicity catch-22 problem, the disulfide bond has been previously used to link less toxic short PEI chains (2 kD), but previous literature results are controversial. Recently, we found that it is vitally important to remove both carbon dioxide and water in the linking reaction as well as to control the structure of the resultant chains linked by dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP).

Conventional methods for the preparation of cylindrical micelles are based on the judicious design of the molecular structures of the soluble and insoluble segments and the manipulation of the external parameters, such as the solvent, temperature, and guest ions/molecules. Here we report on the production of cylindrical micelles by extruding spherical micelles through nanoscale pores. The obtained cylindrical micelles and their transformation back into the spherical micelles are characterized using transmission electron microscopy imaging and dynamic laser light scattering. The extrusion process is continuous and simple and can be upgraded to large scales.

0035115426	Surfactant effect on pH and temperature sensitivities of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-sodium acrylate) microgels	Spherical poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-sodium acrylate) [P(VCL-co-NaA)] microgels are pH and temperature sensitive. The addition of a small amount of anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), can greatly alter its pH and temperature dependence. A combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering was used to study the incorporation of surfactant in the microgels and its effect on the shrinking and swelling. When both pH and temperature were fixed, the microgel swelled as more surfactant was added due to the concentration of surfactant inside the microgel. For a fixed temperature, there existed a critical pH at which the swelling reached its maximum since the addition of NaOH had two opposite effects on electrostatic repulsion, namely, ionizing the COOH group and increasing the ionic strength. The maximum shifted to a lower pH when more surfactant was added. For a fixed pH, the microgel shrunk when the temperature rose. The shrinking temperature became high when the surfactant concentration or pH increased. In comparison with various chemical modifications of a similar system, the incorporation of a small amount of surfactant into the microgel provided a convenient way to vary its critical shrinking temperature and pH for different applications.

The enzyme was irreversibly immobilized on thePMMA-BSA particle surface. The amount of enzyme immobilized on PMMA-BSA particles and the enzymatic activity were determined by UV/vis measurements. The influences of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption indicate that the electrostatic interaction plays a major role on the immobilization. The adsorbed GOx can retain at least 80% of the free enzyme activity.

The effects of pH, polymer concentration, and salt concentration on these two modes have been investigated using laser light scattering (LLS), viscometry, and rheological measurements. Our results showed that the hydrogen bonding between carboxylic group and ether oxygen led to the formation of large complexes among PAA-g-PEO chains, which were absent between PAA and PEO chains in PAA/PEO aqueous solutions. The addition of formamide can break these interchain complexes because the hydrogen bonding between formamide and PAA segment is stronger than that between PEO and PAA segment. Thermodynamically speaking, the formation of hydrogen bonds among PAA-g-PEO chains leads to a less entropy loss than that between PAA and PEO chains in PAA/PEO aqueous solution, because in the former case PEO is already chemically connected to PAA backbone. Therefore, the same enthalpy gain is sufficient to compensate the entropy loss in PAA-g-PEO aqueous solution relative to that in PAA/PEO aqueous solution, resulting in large interchain PAA-g-PEO complexes. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

When the PNIPAM concentration was low, no discernible forces were detected. A further increase in PNIPAM concentration resulted in a long-range attraction which was likely due to a combined of the reduced electrostatic interaction between the silica particle and the flat surface after the polymer adsorption and polymer bridges formation. On the other hand, for a fixed PNIPAM concentration, the interaction potential profiles between the particle and flat surface were once again characterized by attraction as temperature was increased. This attractive force can be explained in terms of the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains at the surfaces, which subsequently affected the polymer adsorption and enhanced the segment-segment interaction among the adsorbed polymer chains. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

77955439534	The slow relaxation mode: From solutions to gel networks	In the past, many laser light-scattering experimental results revealed that besides the fast relaxation mode, there existed an additional slow mode in semidilute solutions. This slow mode has been assigned to a variety of origins, but there has been no clear and well-accepted explanation. As the polymer concentration increases, the slow relaxation mode persists in the concentrated region, in melts and in gels in which polymer chains are crosslinked instead of entangled. The slow relaxation mode has also been reported for charged macromolecules in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions. However, it is generally thought to be different in nature from that observed in semidilute neutral polymer solution. In recent years, armed with novel solution preparation methods and some specially designed polymers, we have reexamined the dynamics of polymer chains, especially the slow mode, in semidilute neutral polymer solutions, dilute polyelectrolyte solutions and gels, which are reviewed here. Our results suggest that the slow mode can be qualitatively considered as hindered motions of interacting chains even though the nature of interaction can be very different; namely, from the weak segment-segment interaction in a less good solvent to strong electrostatic interaction among polyelectrolyte chains, and even to chemical crosslinking inside gel networks. © The Society of Polymer Science, Japan (SPSJ).

By investigating individual event details, we observed mainly four types of events with distinct bilevel current blockades. The majority of the translocation events have a shallow block level with current decrease of ∼60%, followed by a deep block level with current decrease of ∼85%. A mechanism for PSS translocation is proposed and compared with that for ssDNA translocation through the ion channel. Although similar bilevel blockades are observed for both PSS and ssDNA, differences in the chain rigidity between PSS and ssDNA result in distinct populations for each type of event and quite different characteristic translocation times. At a voltage of 160 mV, the PSS chains are more likely to thread the narrowest constriction and translocate through the pore than to escape from the vestibule against the applied voltage gradient. Increasing the applied voltage decreases the duration time of chain translocation through the pore, while increasing the characteristic time of the PSS within the vestibule. We further find that the translocation event rate is exponentially dependent on the applied potential while the most likely duration time also decreases exponentially with the voltage. These results demonstrate how the nature of the polyelectrolyte chain influences translocation process through protein ion channels. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

During the past two decades, with the advances in light scattering instrumentation and sophisticated methods of data analysis, both types of motions can be distinguished in experiments and utilized for testing molecular theories of polymer chain dynamics in dilute solution. In this article, we first review some previous experiments, in particular the dynamical properties of polystyrene (PS) and polyisoprene (PIP) chains in good and theta (Θ) solvents, and then our own results, including a comparative study of the internal motions of poly(N-isopropylacryl-amide) (PNIPAM) linear chains and spherical microgels under good solvent conditions. The final part of this article deals with how the solvent quality (the solution temperature) affects the internal mobility of PNIPAM linear chains and microgels. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

79953839673	Revisit complexation between DNA and polyethylenimine - Effect of uncomplexed chains free in the solution mixture on gene transfection	Our revisit of the complexation between anionic DNA and cationic polyethylenimine (PEI) in both water and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by using a combination of laser light scattering (LLS) and gel electrophoresis confirms that nearly all the DNA chains are complexed with PEI to form polyplexes when the molar ratio of nitrogen from PEI to phosphate from DNA (N:P) reaches ~ 3, but the PEI/DNA polyplexes have a high in-vitro gene transfection efficiency only when N:P ≥ 10. Putting these two facts together, we not only conclude that this extra 7 portions of PEI chains are free in the solution mixture, but also confirmed that it is these free PEI chains that substantially promote the gene transfection no matter whether they are applied hours before or after the administration of the much less effective PEI/DNA polyplexes (N:P = 3). The uptake kinetics measured by flow cytometry shows that the addition of free PEI leads to a faster and more efficient cellular internalization of polyplexes, but these free PEI chains mainly contribute to the subsequent intracellular trafficking. In contrast, the bound PEI chains mainly play a role in the DNA condensation and protection, leading to a different thinking in the development of non-viral vectors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

0036011420	A hybrid polymer gel and its static nonergodicity	We used a thermally reversible hybrid gel made of billions of physically jam-packed swollen thermally sensitive poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide) chemical microgels. Laser light scattering study on a series of such hybrid gels formed at different gelling rates and temperatures revealed that the position-dependence of the scattering speckle pattern (static nonergodicity) came from large voids formed during the sol-gel transition. With a proper preparation, such a nonergodicity could be completely removed, indicating that the static nonergodicity generally observed in a gel is not intrinsic, but comes from the clustering "island" structure formed during the gelation process.

0035798014	Noncovalently connected polymeric micelles in aqueous medium	Differing from the conventional micelles made of block or graft copolymers, in which the core and corona are connected by covalent bonding, the micelles reported in this paper are composed of a polymer pair and the core and corona are connected by hydrogen bonding. Poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) (SMAA) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVPo) self-assembled into spherical micelles with hydrodynamic radii around 100 nm in aqueous medium. These stable micelles are composed of the core of collapsed SMAA chains and the corona of solvated PVPo chains. The hydrogen bonding between methacrylic acid and PVPo units and the difference in the solubility in water between SMAA and PVPo are the main factors responsible for the micelle formation. Using dynamic light scattering, it was found that the hydrodynamic radius of the micelles significantly increases with increasing initial concentrations of both SMAA and PVPo. The micelle size dose not depend on the MAA content (3.55-13.1 mol %) in SMAA monotonically, which can be rationalized by the coexistence of different stabilization mechanisms. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) was used to observe morphologies of the micelles. The core-shell structure of the micelles became visualized only when adequate staining of the TEM specimens was employed.

0035845786	Application of the temperature-ramped holographic relaxation spectroscopy in the investigation of physically cross-linked gels	Holographic relaxation spectroscopy (HRS), also known as forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS), can be used to study slow translational diffusion of probes inside a polymer gel. In this study, we demonstrated that, besides the translational diffusion coefficient, a combination of temperature ramp with HRS could lead to additional information on physically cross-linked gels, such as the gel content, the gel melting temperature, and the gel structure. Using a gelatin gel as an example, we correlated the temperature dependence of the intensity of the diffracted light to the formation of triple-stranded helixes (i.e., the renaturalization process). Such a correlation was supported by the optical rotation study. Our results showed that the renaturalization followed the first-order kinetics. The applications of such a combination of the temperature ramp with HRS have been envisioned.

The shrinking of the microgel at temperatures higher than 32 °C dramatically reduces its surface area, providing a convenient way to vary the grafting density. At the initial stage of the shrinking, we observed an expected steric repulsion-driven chain stretching, in which the hydrodynamic volume of the grafted PEO chains is incompressible, contrary to previously reported results.

0035597735	Novel synthesis of long multi-block heteropolymer chains with an ordered sequence and controllable block lengths	It had very long been a dream in polymer science to synthesize long multi-block polymer chains with an ordered chain sequence and controllable block lengths. Using ionic or living free radical polymerization or furnishing each end of polymer blocks with a reactive functional group, one can only prepare heteropolymer chains with few long blocks, such as diblock and triblock copolymers. The most plausible result so far was a pentablock copolymer. Recently, using a combination of polymer physics and synthetic chemistry, we have invented self-assembly assisted polycondensation (SAAP). This communication reports the results of using this novel method to connect 10-100 triblock polymer chains together to form long multi-block heteropolymer chains with an ordered sequence and controllable block lengths.

0035940795	Nonergodic dynamics of a novel thermally sensitive hybrid gel	As the temperature decreases, the swelling of individual thermally sensitive spherical poly-(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgels in a concentrated dispersion can lead to a sol-gel transition, resulting in a hybrid bulk gel in which individual microgels were physically jam-packed into a three-dimensional network without involving electrostatic interaction, resembling the glass transition of small molecules. The dynamics of such a formed hybrid gel were studied by static and dynamic laser light scattering. Our results showed that the inhomogeneity should be characterized by the difference between the ensemble average scattering intensity and the dynamic component of the time average scattering intensity. The inhomogeneity was strongly dependent on the sol-gel transition rate and the gelling temperature. Our results have also revealed that the inhomogeneity can be completely suppressed if individual swollen microgels are closely packed together, indicating that the static nonergodic behaviour originates from large voids formed during the sol-gel transition.

79958118811	Revisit complexation between DNA and polyethylenimine - Effect of length of free polycationic chains on gene transfection	Our revisit of the complexation between DNA and polyethylenimine (PEI) by using a combination of laser light scattering and gel electrophoresis confirms that nearly all the DNA chains are complexed with PEI to form polyplexes when the molar ratio of nitrogen from PEI to phosphate from DNA (N:P) reaches ~ 3, irrespective of the PEI chain length and solvent. Each solution mixture with N:P > 3 contains two kinds of PEI chains: bound to DNA and free in the solution. It has been shown that it is those free PEI chains that play a vital role in promoting the gene transfection. The effects of the length of the bound and free chains on the gene transfection were respectively studied. Both short and long PEI chains are capable of condensing DNA completely at N:P ~ 3 but long ones are ~ 10

79961025743	Coatings with a self-generating hydrogel surface for antifouling	We prepared a coating by mixing a polyfunctional axiridine cross-linking agent and a self-polishing resin pre-synthesized via the polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylic acid (AA) and tributylsilyl methacrylate (TBSM). The coating can be easily applied on a surface to form a cross-linked polymer film by conventional brushing or spraying method. After immersing it into seawater, the film self-generates a thin soft and dynamic layer of hydrogel at the water-contacting surface because of the hydrolysis of TBSM. Such a hydrogel-formation process continues after gradual corrosion and detachment of each top hydrophilic layer. This hydrogel-formation and self-peeling property makes it ideal in various antifouling applications. In the current study, besides the synthesis and preparation of this novel kind of coatings, we focused on the correlation between the TBSM content and the antifouling property by using contact angle, water-absorption, and antifouling measurements. The results of immersing different coatings in shallow submergence for two months reveal that the addition of more TBSM leads to a more hydrophilic surface and a better antifouling property. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

80051771429	"Click" long seesaw-type a∼∼b∼∼a chains together into huge defect-free hyperbranched polymer chains with uniform subchains	Commonly, hyperbranched polymers are synthesized through the step-growth approach, such as polycondensation, addition step-growth reactions and cycloaddition, or the chain-growth approach, including the self-condensing vinyl copolymerization and the ring-opening multibranching polymerization. Each of them extends the subchain between two neighboring branching points by one macromonomer length because it remains as a small side substitute on the subchain, resulting in hyperbranched polymers with subchains with a broad length distribution. The ATRP initiator of 1,3-dibromomethyl-5-propargyloxybenzene (DBMPB) was prepared with dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate as a starting reagent. The peaks related to high molar masses increase and become more and more dominant. Similar multimodal distributions of hyperbranched polymer chains with lower molarmasses were also previously reported in the literature.

80055007013	General approach to polymer chains confined by interacting boundaries. II. Flow through a cylindrical nano-tube	The Laplace-Greens function methods of Paper I are extended to describe polymers confined in interacting, impenetrable cylindrical geometries, whose treatment is far more challenging than the slit and box geometries considered in Paper I. The general methods are illustrated with calculations (as a function of the polymer-surface interaction) of the free energy of confinement, the radial density profile, and the average of the drag force in the free draining limit, quantities that will be used elsewhere to analyze experiments of Wu and co-workers involving the flow of polymers through nanopores. All these properties are evaluated by numerical inverse Laplace transforms of closed form analytical expressions, a significant savings over the traditional eigenfunction approaches. The example of the confinement free energy for a 3-arm star polymer illustrates the treatment when a closed form expression for the Laplace transform is unavailable. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

84856315908	Preparation of true solutions of monomeric amyloidogenic protein/peptide: A critical prerequisite for aggregation kinetic study	Our dynamic laser light scattering (LLS) study shows that the current widely used protocols of dissolving amyloidogenic protein/peptide do not really result in a true solution; namely, there always exist a trace amount of interchain aggregates, which greatly affect the association kinetics, partially explaining why different kinetics were reported even for a solution with identical protein and solvent. Recently, using a combination of the conventional dissolution procedure and our newly developed ultra-filtration method, we have developed a novel protocol to prepare a true solution of amyloidogenic protein/peptide without any interchain aggregates. The resultant solutions remain in their monomeric state for at least one week, which is vitally important for further study of the very initial stage of the interchain association under the physiological conditions because more and more evidence suggests that it is those small oligomers rather than large fabric aggregates that are cytotoxic. In addition, this study shows that combining static and dynamic LLS can lead to more physical and microscopic information about the protein association instead of only the size distribution. © 2011 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The large surface area of these nanoparticles resulted in a high enzyme loading. The BSA protein shell provided biocompatible microenvironment to retain the native structure and bioactivity of the immobilized enzymes. Such biosensors were characterized by both cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry.

84861375831	How does DNA complex with polyethylenimine with different chain lengths and topologies in their aqueous solution mixtures?	Complexation between DNA with anionic charges (P) and polyethylenimine (PEI) with cationic charges (N) in aqueous solution condenses DNA into small insoluble aggregates (polyplexes), facilitating its delivery into cells. The study of the captioned problem is long overdue. Using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering, we showed that for a given topology PEI with a high molar mass is more effective in condensing DNA, while for a given molar mass, linear chains are more efficient in neutralizing DNA than their branched counterparts. The resultant polyplexes become stable when N/P ≥ 6 and, quantitatively, on average contain only one DNA. The ratio of gyration to hydrodynamic radii decreases after the DNA and PEI complexation but increases with the N/P ratio. This study reveals that linear chains can align themselves on DNA to effectively neutralize its anionic charges so that DNA collapses in water mainly due to its insolubility like a neutral hydrocarbon chain, while cationic branched chains condense each DNA chain mainly by pulling its intrachain anionic segments together and coat its periphery to form a mushroom-like PEI shell. Such two different condensation ways are supported by the results of adding strong polyanions (dextran sulfate, DS) into the polyplexes dispersion; namely, DS can ripe linear chains away from each polyplex layer by layer, like peeling an onion, to completely release DNA, but mostly strip cationic branched chains coated on the periphery, not those inside, to partially release DNA. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84864406891	Fouling-release property of water-filled porous elastomers	Since the fouling-releasing ability of silicone elastomers increased as their modulus decreases, we designed and prepared composites with embedded tiny NaCl crytals that were soluble after their immersion in water, resulting in water-filled porous elastomers. The scanning electron microscope images confirmed such a designed water-filling porous structure. The existence of many micro-drops of water in these specially designed elastomers decreased the shear storage modulus and increased the loss factors. The decrease of shear modulus plays a leading role here and is directly related to a lower critical peeling-off stress of a pseudo-barnacle on them. Therefore, such a novel preparation with cheap salts instead of an expensive silicone provides a better way to make fouling-release paints with a lower modulus, a lower critical peeling-off stress and a better fouling-release property without a significant decrease of the cross-linking density. © 2012 Chinese Physical Society.

Both the tethered PNIPAM shell and the copolymer microgel core shrunk as the temperature increased, but in different temperature ranges. In the range ∼28-32 °C, the tethered PNIPAM chains underwent a coil-to-globule transition, while in the range ∼32-35 °C, the shrinking of the copolymer core induced a re-stretching of the collapsed PNIAPM chains on its surface to form a polymer brush in poor solvent. Our results showed that in the re-stretching process, the average hydrodynamic volume per tethered PNIPAM chain remained a constant, confirming a prediction made a long time ago that the collapsed chains in poor solvent were incompressible.

0037076615	Encapsulation of phthalocyanines in biodegradable poly(sebacic anhydride) nanoparticles	A new series of phthalocyanine-containing biodegradable copolymers, namely poly(phthalocyanine-cosebacic anhydride) (Pc-SA), have been synthesized. For copolymers with a low Pc content, the Pc rings exist mainly as monomeric species in chloroform, while the aggregation of these macrocycles becomes significant as the Pc content increases. Nanoparticles with an average hydrodynamic radius of 166 nm have been prepared from the copolymer Pc-SA-5, which has a Pc to sebacic acid molar ratio of 0.01, via a microphase inversion method. The collapse of polymer chains in the formation of Pc-SA-5 nanoparticles leads to aggregation of the Pc rings inside. The aggregation tendency decreases upon degradation of the nanoparticles in alkaline media, giving ultimately monomeric species. The degradation kinetics of Pc-SA-5 nanoparticles have been investigated by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. It has been found that the rate of degradation increases with the pH and temperature. By using absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, the release of Pc can be monitored, which occurs almost simultaneously with the degradation. The results suggest that this novel polymer-based colloidal system is potentially useful for the delivery and release of photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy.

0037355258	The viscoelastic effect on the formation of meso-globular phase of dilute heteropolymer solutions	Linear homopolymer chains in poor solvent exist either as individual crumpled single chain globules or as macroscopic precipitate, depending on whether the solution is in the one- or the two-phase region. However, linear heteropolymer chains in dilute solution might be able to form stable mesoglobules made up of a limited number of chains if the degree of amphiphilicity of the chain is sufficiently high and the experimental conditions are appropriate. The self-assembly of block copolymers in a selective solvent is typical of such examples. In practice, the formation of stable mesoglobules can be directly related to the formation of novel polymeric nanoparticles in solution. In this article, we will address the formation of mesoglobular phase not only on the basis of thermodynamics, but also from a kinetic point of view, which leads to the discussion of how viscoelasticity can affect the phase behavior of heteropolymer chains in dilute solution. The formation and stabilization of several different kinds of novel polymeric nanoparticles will be used to illustrate our discussion.

0037136819	Effect of concentration on the photoinduced aggregation of polymer nanoparticles	We describe the effect of concentration on the photoinduced flocculation and aggregation of a nonaqueous dispersion of core-shell nanoparticles (diameter = 50 nm), which consist of a tightly cross-linked core composed of poly(butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and a lightly cross-linked shell of poly(butyl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate-co-methacrylic acid). The particles could be dispersed in cyclohexane after modification of the acid groups by ester formation with 2-bromo-1-phenyl-octadecan- 1-one. Photocleavage of these substituents (λ = 310 mn) regenerated the -COOH groups and led to aggregation of the destabilized particles. Since the rate of aggregation is relatively slow in this system, we were able to study the process of particle aggregation kinetics by a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering. Our results indicate, for particle dispersions from 0.23 mg/mL to 0.93 mg/mL, that there are three stages in the aggregation process. Initially, several particles come into contact to form small elongated clusters. Subsequently, these clusters undergo further aggregation to form larger aggregates characterized by a fractal dimension of around 2.3. This result indicates that aggregation in the second stage follows a reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregation mechanism. At very long times, the aggregate size appears to level off, consistent with a reversible aggregation mechanism. We also found for the three different concentrations that the measured average radius of gyration 〈R

After the addition of PEO, the intensity of the transient absorption at ca. 490 nm, arising from the triplet state of the nonaggregated ZnPc, increases, and the triplet lifetime becomes longer.

Using these copolymers, we investigated the temperature induced coil-to-globule transition of individual chains in dilute solution. In each case, we found that the copolymer chains could form stable single-chain globules at high temperatures, and as expected, the transition temperatures were higher than ∼32 °C because comonomer VP is hydrophilic in the temperature range studied. The laser light-scattering and calorimetry results showed that the chains prepared at 60 °C, presumably with a globular proteinlike segmented VP distribution, had a lower transition temperature and could form denser globules than those prepared at 30 °C with a random VP distribution. In other words, the folding of the chains prepared at higher temperatures was easier. In a sense, they could "memorize" their parent globular core-shell structure with a collapsed PNIPAM core and a swollen shell made of small VP loops, reflecting in a ratio of the radius of gyration to hydrodynamic radius (〈R

0037180003	Temperature induced hydrophobic adsorption and desorption of linear polymer chains on surfactant-free latex nanoparticles	The adsorption of thermally sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) on surfactant-free polystyrene latex was used as a model system to study the effect of chain hydrophobicity on the adsorption of protein on hydrophobic surface. PNIPAM is only soluble in water at lower temperatures with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of ∼32 °C. Using PNIPAM, we were able to continuously adjust the chain hydrophobicity and manipulate the adsorption by a simply temperature variation. A combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering was used to study the amount of the adsorption and the thickness of the adsorbed polymer layer. We found that there existed a hysteresis of the adsorption in the heating-and-cooling cycle, indicating an additional adsorption at temperatures higher than the LCST. We also found that the heating rate could greatly affect the adsorption. Our results revealed that the desorption accompanying the swelling of the adsorbed PNIPAM layer was logarithmically proportional to the desorption time, indicating a diffusion-controlled process.

Photocleavage of these substituents (λ = 310 nm) regenerated the -COOH groups and led to slow aggregation of the destabilized particles. This system allowed us to study the process of particle aggregation kinetics in the absence of long-range electrostatic interaction by using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering.

0037462889	Structure of a collapsed polymer chain with stickers: A single or multiflower?	The presence of a few molar per cent of hydrophobic monomer units in a hydrophilic polymer chain can trigger chain association in water or in a selective solvent to form gels or clusters, depending on solvency and polymer concentration. Such associating copolymers are widely used as viscosity modifiers, colloidal stabilizers, and surface-active agents. It is said that self-folding may lead to single-flowerlike core-shell nanostructure with all stickers condensed in the center and the chain segments between stickers swollen like a flower petal. It is believed that such a chain folding may provide a simple model for th study of more complicated problems, such as protein folding and DNA packing.

The copolymers made of DEA and DMA or DEA and EA are hydrophilic at T < ∼32 °C, but become amphiphilic in the higher temperature range. The synthesis of two series of P(DEA-co-DMA) and P(DEA-co-EA) copolymers with a similar chain length, but different compositions (30 and 50 mol % of DMA and 40, 60, and 80 mol % of EA, respectively), enabled us to study the composition dependence of their association in water by laser light scattering. Our results showed that a limited number of these neutral copolymer chains could associate together to form stable mesoglobules existing between single-chain collapsed globules and macroscopic precipitation. Besides thermodynamical consideration, the formation of such mesoglobules can also be attributed to the competition between intrachain contraction and interchain association as well as the viscoelastic effect. Increasing the hydrophilic DMA or EA content leads to a larger average aggregation number, but increasing the heating rate results in smaller, but less dense, mesoglobules consisting of many loosely associated small single- or pauci-chain globules. For the copolymers with higher EA contents, we unexpectedly found that interchain association can gradually relax to intrachain association as time elapses.

0037515554	Rheological study of the sol-gel transition of hybrid gels	As the temperature decreases, thermally sensitive spherical poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels with a lower critical solution temperature (LOST ∼ 32 °C) swell in a dispersion, leading to a possible volume-concentration induced sol-gel transition if the microgel concentration is sufficiently high. In such a formed gel, polymer chains inside each microgel were chemically cross-linked, but individual microgels were physically close-packed into a three-dimensional network. Such hybrid gels can be used as model systems for studying the sol-gel transition, which avoids several problems, such as chain entanglements, phase separation, and vitrification, normally occurring in a gelling process. The sol-gel transition of such hybrid gels was studied by the change of viscoelastic modulus G′ and G″. As expected, the sol-gel transition depends on the polymer concentration, frequency, and shear stress. The gelation point could be roughly estimated by the method of Winter and Chambon. Our results showed that the temperature dependence of G″ and tan δ(=G″/G′) had a minimum, which corresponded to the sol-gel transition, providing a better way to determine the sol-gel transition temperature.

Tissue tractions in subcutaneous tissue, in muscle, around a peripheral nerve, and around an artery were mild. Degradation made rapid progress, starting on the third day and completed in 2-3 weeks. The hybrid gel, when wrapped around the cut ends of a peripheral nerve or an artery, functioned well as a bridging tube. In the case of the cut nerve, regenerating fascicles crept through the tube which protected them from fibrosis. In the case of the cut artery, patency of flow was maintained, and arterial wall healing was complete in 2-3 weeks. The hybrid gel composite contracted at body temperature, thus holding well to body tissues.

Using single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), the distribution of the desorption force per PS segment adsorbed on the PS substrate in water was measured for the first time. The linear dependence of the most probable desorption force on the logarithm of the stretching velocity experimentally revealed that the adsorption and desorption of the PS segments on the PS substrate is a dynamic process. Furthermore, it was estimated that the desorption force per PS monomer unit from the PS substrate in water is in the range 1.3-2.1 pN, depending on the imposed stretching velocity.

Aside from making existing catalysts and polymerization conditions optimal, polymer chemists should focus on developing new catalysts, new synthetic methods, and new polymerization processes. An area that should be of particular interest is that of bio-catalysts and bio-synthesis because of the inevitable exhaustion of crude oils and natural gases on which the modern polymer industry has been built. For polymer physics, the focus should still lie in the development of novel methodologies to solve remaining fundamental problems that are related to polymer processes by concentrating on correlations between polymer properties and chain structures as well as process conditions.

84875788697	An active one-particle microrheometer: Incorporating magnetic tweezers to total internal reflection microscopy	We present a novel microrheometer by incorporating magnetic tweezers in the total internal reflection microscopy (TIRM) that enables measuring of viscoelastic properties of materials near solid surface. An evanescent wave generated by a solidliquid interface in the TIRM is used as the incident light source in the microrheometer. When a probe particle (of a few micrometers diameter) moves near the interface, it can interact with the evanescent field and reflect its position with respect to the interface by the scattered light intensity. The exponential distance dependence of the evanescent field, on the one hand, makes this technique extremely sensitive to small changes from z-fluctuations of the probe (with a resolution of several nanometers), and on the other, it does not require imaging of the probe with high lateral resolution. Another distinct advantage is the high sensitivity in determining the z position of the probe in the absence of any labeling. The incorporated magnetic tweezers enable us to effectively manipulate the distance of the embedded particle from the interface either by a constant or an oscillatory force. The force ramp is easy to implement through a coil current ramp. In this way, the local viscous and elastic properties of a given system under different confinements can therefore be measured by resolving the near-surface particle motion. To test the feasibility of applying this microrheology to soft materials, we measured the viscoelastic properties of sucrose and poly(ethylene glycol) solutions and compared the results to bulk rheometry. In addition, we applied this technique in monitoring the structure and properties of deformable microgel particles near the flat surface. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.

84875423631	Novel hybrid anti-biofouling coatings with a self-peeling and self-generated micro-structured soft and dynamic surface	We prepared hybrid antifouling coatings with a self-generated topographical microgel surface by mixing small surface-functionalized microgels with a self-peeling resin and a poly-functional cross-linking agent (axiridine). The microgels were prepared by copolymerizing acrylamide (AAm) and methacrylic acid (MAA). The resin is a random terpolymer made of methyl methacrylate (MMA), acrylic acid (AA) and triisopropylsilyl methacrylate (TIPSM). During the coating process, the microgels and terpolymer chains are cross-linked together to form a hard thin film. After it is immersed into sea water, the microgels dispersed and embedded on the film surface are swollen, generating small and soft bumps, and at the same time, the hydrolysis of TIPSM makes the surface layer hydrophilic, forming a thin layer of soft hydrogel. A combination of these two effects leads to a soft and dynamic topographical surface layer with many well-structured microgel bumps. Such a soft and dynamic surface is self-generating; namely, the hydrolysis of TIPSM eventually makes the terpolymer chains on the surface soluble so that a thin layer of them is gradually dissolved and washed away and the inner layer is further exposed to sea water. Here, both the self-peeling and topographically structured surface by small microgel bumps lead to antifouling properties. To test such a novel idea, we prepared a set of coatings with different microgel and TIPSM contents and evaluated their antifouling properties in a real marine environment. We found some optimal composition at which the coatings showed excellent antifouling properties in the field tests. Moreover, adding the microgels reduces the amount of expensive TIPSM required so that the coatings become more cost-effective, which is vitally important for industrial applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84876332622	Progress and perspectives in developing polymeric vectors for in vitro gene delivery	The development of safe, efficient and controllable gene-delivery vectors has become a bottleneck to human gene therapy. Synthetic polymeric vectors, although safer than viral carriers, generally do not possess the required efficacy, apparently due to a lack of functionality to overcome at least one of many intracellular gene-delivery obstacles. Currently, the exact mechanisms of how these polymeric vectors navigate each intracellular obstacle ("slit"), as well as their particular physical/chemical properties that contribute to efficient intracellular trafficking remain largely unknown, making it rather difficult to further improve the efficacy of non-viral polymeric vectors in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we first give a brief overview of synthetic polymeric vectors that have been designed and developed for gene delivery and highlight some promising candidates for clinical applications. Our main focus is on discussing the intracellular trafficking mechanisms of the DNA-polymer complexes ("polyplexes"), with less effort on the DNA-polymer complexation in the extracellular space as well as the in vivo systemic administration of genes in animal models and human clinical trials. In particular, we identified and discussed four critical, but often over-looked issues for successful DNA-polymer intracellular trafficking, especially our recent confirmation that it is free cationic polymer chains in the solution mixture of DNA and polymer that actually promote gene transfection and the polycationic chains within the polyplexes mainly play a protective role. Instead of the previously proposed and widely used escape model from late endolysosomes, the current hypothesis is that free polycationic chains with a sufficient length (∼20 nm) can block the initial endocytic-vesicle-to- endolysosome pathway. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84884220187	Fast electrically driven photonic crystal based on charged block copolymer	We have developed electrically driven photonic crystals (PCs) from a quaternized polystyrene-b-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) block copolymer which can form a one dimensional periodic lamellar structure. The variation of applied voltage from -4.50 to +2.36 V on the PCs can lead to color display over the entire visible region with a sub-second fast response, where the periodic structure swells from 4.3 to 7 times that at dry state. The fast response is attributed to the charging of the P2VP block. Besides, the photonic crystal exhibits a reverse volatility behavior, that is, as the applied voltage increases, the reflective peak wavelength decreases. Such fast switching PCs are facilely prepared with low driving voltage and good durability. The PCs are expected to find applications in information technologies. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

0041819792	Formation of mesoglobular phase of amphiphilic copolymer chains in dilute solution: Effect of comonomer distribution	Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a thermally sensitive polymer with a lower critical solution temperature (∼32°C) in water. Its copolymerization with hydrophilic vinylpyrrolidone (VP) at temperatures higher and lower than its LCST respectively resulted in segmented and random VP distributions. As the solution temperature increases, PNIPAM changes from hydrophilic to hydrophobic at ∼32°C so that copolymer P(NIPAM-co-VP) becomes amphiphilic in water at higher temperatures. The association of two pairs of such copolymers with a similar chain composition and length, but different comonomer distributions, in water at temperatures higher than 32°C was studied by laser light scattering. A limited number of neutral P(NIPAM-co-VP) chains can associate to form narrowly distributed stable mesoglobules existing between single-chain collapsed globules and macroscopic precipitates. The copolymer chains with a segmented VP distribution aggregate more readily to form larger mesoglobules than their counterpart with a random VP distribution. The formation of mesoglobules is related to a competition between intrachain contraction and interchain association. Besides thermodynamic consideration, the formation of a stable mesoglobular phase is also affected by chain viscoelasticity inside each aggregate, even in dilute solution. A proper variation of the chain structure and association temperature can result in mesoglobules with different sizes, molar masses, and structures.

0344235461	Micellar formation of poly(caprolactone-block-ethylene oxide-block-caprolactone) and its enzymatic biodegradation in aqueous dispersion	The water-insoluble triblock copolymer poly(ε-caprolactone-b-ethylene oxide-b-ε-caprolactone) (PCL-b-PEO-b-PCL) can form core - shell-like polymeric micelles in aqueous solution where the core and shell are respectively made of collapsed hydrophobic PCL and swollen hydrophilic PEO blocks. Four PCL-b-PEO-b-PCL triblock copolymers with different PEO/PCL molar ratios were prepared and characterized. The degradation of these copolymer micelles in the presence of enzyme lipase PS was much faster than the bulk PCL or PCL thin film. The degradation kinetics was investigated using a combination of laser light scattering and pH measurements. The results revealed that the in-situ biodegradation of the copolymer chains inside the micelle could be effectively monitored by a pH meter, while laser light scattering measures the biodegradation-induced dissociation of the micelles in water. The effects of the enzyme and copolymer concentrations as well as the PCL/PEO molar ratios on the biodegradation kinetics were studied.

0142123143	Synthesis, characterization, biodegradation, and in vitro photodynamic activities of silicon(IV) phthalocyanines conjugated axially with poly(ε-caprolactone)	A new series of phthalocyanine-containing biodegradable poly(ε-caprolactone)s have been synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone and/or 5-ethylene ketal ε-caprolactone using silicon phthalocyanine dihydroxide as the initiator and tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate as the catalyst. The polymers have been spectroscopically characterized, and their molecular weights have been determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). All the polymers exhibit typical electronic absorption and fluorescence characteristics for nonaggregated phthalocyanines. The singlet oxygen quantum yields of selected polymers have been determined and found to be slightly lower than that of unsubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanine in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF).

0342468903	Controllable interaction between cations and thermally sensitive poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-sodium acrylate) microgels in water	The microgels made of poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) and a few percent of sodium acrylate (SA) were used as a model system to study the cation induced aggregation of colloid particles. Using such microgels make the aggregation controllable and reversible because PVCL can gradually change from hydrophilic (soluble) to hydrophobic (insoluble) in water when the temperature is increased in the range 25-35°C. The aggregation induced by different kinds of cations and at different temperatures was investigated by using a combination of static and dynamic laser light scattering (LLS). At temperatures lower than ∼30°C, the microgel shrinks with increasing the cation concentration due to the increase in the ionic strength and the intra-microgel complexation. The extent of the shrinking induced by different cations follows the order of Hg

0343191633	Intermacromolecular complexes due to specific interactions. 13. Formation of micelle-like structure from hydrogen-bonding graft-like complexes in selective solvents	The complexation between poly(4-vinyl pyridine) (PVPy) and mono-carboxy terminated polystyrene (MCPS) in chloroform leads to the formation of a graft-like supramolecular architecture. LLS and fluorescence spectroscopy have been used to monitor the self-assembly process of the 'graft' copolymers in a selective mixed solvent of chloroform/toluene which is a solvent for MCPS but a nonsolvent for PVPy. Adding toluene to PVPy/MCPS-1.8 blend solution in chloroform leads to a stable and clear solution indicating the formation of the micelle-like core-shell structure with the core and shell made of PVPy and MCPS, respectively. Here, the cores and shells are linked by hydrogen bonding. The final micelle-like particles are narrowly distributed and very stable on standing. Adding the blend solution of PVPy and MCPS in chloroform to an excess of toluene also produces micelles but these have a much smaller average hydrodynamic radius ((R(h))) than those prepared by adding toluene to the blend solution. As the molar mass of MCPS is increased, the size of micelle-like structures increases dramatically. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0343442519	Swelling and shrinking of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) chains adsorbed on the surface of polystyrene nanoparticles	As a thermally sensitive polymer, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is hydrophilic at temperatures below its lower critical solution temperature (LCST, approx. 32°C), but undergoes a coil-to-globule transition in water at higher temperatures. The adsorption of PNIPAM on polystyrene (PS) nanoparticles resulted in a core-shell nanostructure. In the first heating-and-cooling cycle there existed a hysteresis in terms of the thickness of the adsorbed PNIPAM layer; this could be attributed to additional binding of the adsorbed PNIPAM chains to the surface. Moreover, the surface shifted the coil-to-globule transition to a lower temperature and made the transition less sharp. The temperature dependence of the ratio of the radius of gyration to the hydrodynamic radius (〈R

84888595316	How long cylindrical micelles formed after extruding block copolymer in a selective solvent through a small pore fragment back into spherical ones	The slow cylinder-to-sphere transition for cylindrical micelles from nanopore extrusion is quantitatively investigated by using transmission electron microscopy. The time-dependent length distribution and weight-average length of cylindrical micelles from experiment were compared with those calculated ones from computer simulation on the basis of end-scission, random-scission and Gaussian-scission models. The results reveal that the cylinder-to-sphere transition involves a combination of the Gaussian-scission model and the end-scission model and the scission rate constant is nearly a linear function of micelle length but slightly increases with time for a given length. As expected, such a thermal agitation induced transition with the spherical phase as its thermodynamically stable state is different from those previously observed in the shear-induced fragmentation of long cylindrical micelles made of amphiphilic block copolymers in a selective solvent. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84888608663	A portable, stable and precise laser differential refractometer	In this work, we present a portable laser differential refractometer with real-time detection and high precision based on the Snell's law and a 2f-2f optical design. The 2f-2f configuration solves a traditional position drifting problem of the laser beam and enhances the signal stability, where a small pinhole is illuminated by the laser light and imaged to the detector by lens placed in the middle between the detector and the pinhole. However, it also leads to a larger dimension of the instrument, limiting its applications and its sensitivity that is proportional to the optical path. Therefore, for a portable device on the basis of the 2f-2f design, a combination of a mirror and a lens was developed to minimize the optical path without affecting the 2f-2f design. Our simple and compact design reaches a resolution of 10

84891891238	How do polymer chains with different topologies pass through a cylindrical pore under an elongational flow field?	Translocation of polymer chains through nanopores (ultrafiltration behavior) is not only a basic problem in polymer physics and biophysics, but also related to many physical and chemical processes, such as gene transfection, protein transportation, and separation of polymer chains by size exclusion chromatography. However, due to the lack of appropriate polymer model samples as well as ideal elongational flow fields, the ultrafiltration behavior of polymer chains has not been systematically explored experimentally for a long time. To deeply understand the ultrafiltration behavior of polymer chains and verify relevant theory, we have made much effort on this subject in the past decade. In this article, we' 11 first review the classic theory of polymer chains passing through nanopores, and then provide an overview of our recent theoretical and experimental research achievements in this field, more specifically, we have (1) successfully observed the "coil-to-stretch" first-order transition of polymer linear chain passing through nanopores, and found that the critical flow rate (q

84898973046	Dielectric investigations on how Mg salt is dispersed in and released from polylactic acid	Composite biomaterials made of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) and bioactive magnesium (Mg) salt are developed for orthopaedic implants or metal implant coatings. The releasing of Mg salt into the biological environment benefits the bone growth, while with the releasing of Mg salt and degradation of PLA there forms a porous scaffold for tissue engineering. The size and morphology of the salt and voids are adjustable with such preparation conditions as salt content, pH of casting solution, and the solidification rate, so that we can control the salt releasing and degradation rate of PLA. Dielectric spectroscopy is used to investigate the dispersive structures of Mg salt and voids in the polymer matrix and to monitor the in situ releasing of Mg salts in the simulated body fluid (SBF). The current study provides us with an orthopedic biomaterial with controllable multi-phase structures, and a tool to investigate the in vivo behaviors of biomaterials. © Chinese Chemical Society.

84920186748	How does a polymer brush repel proteins?	The captioned question has been addressed by the steric effect; namely, the adsorption of proteins on a surface grafted with linear polymer chains decreases monotonically as the grafting density increases. However, there is no quantitative and satisfactory explanation why the adsorption starts to increase when the grafting density is sufficiently high and why polyethylene glycol (PEG) still remains as one of the best polymers to repel proteins. After considering each grafted chain as a molecular spring confined inside a “tube” made of its surrounding grafted chains, we estimated how its free energy depends on the grafting density and chain length, and calculated its thermal energy-agitated chain conformation fluctuation, enabling us to predict an adsorption minimum at a proper grafting density, which agrees well with previous experimental results. We propose that it is such a chain fluctuation that slows down the adsorption kinetically.

0346459577	Another way to view the chain conformation broadening of the line-width distribution measured in dynamic light scattering	In dynamic laser light scattering (LLS), for a given polydisperse sample, a line-width distribution G(Γ) or the translational diffusion coefficient distribution G(D) can be obtained from the measured time correlation function. For rigid colloid particles, G(Γ) can be directly related to the hydrodynamic size distribution. However, for flexible polymer chains, G(Γ) depends not only on the chain length distribution, but also on the relaxation of the chain conformation; that is, even for a monodisperse polymer sample there still exists a chain conformation distribution. If the time scale of the chain conformation relaxation is comparable to that of the translational diffusion, such as in the case of a very long polymer chain, the conformation relaxation might lead to an additional broadening in G(Γ) . This "conformation broadening" has been directly observed for the first time by comparing two G(Γ)s obtained from a poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide) solution at ∼ 25°C and ∼ 32°C at which the solution is thermodynamically stable, where the fact is utilized that the PNIPAM chain can change from an extended and flexible coil at ∼ 25°C into a highly collapsed and compact globule at ∼ 32°C at which point the polymer chain conformation distribution has diminished.

1042304497	Thermosensitive Behavior of Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) Grafted Polystyrene Nanoparticles	We analyzed the thermosensitive behavior of monodisperse polystyrene (PSt) nanopatticles having different densities and chain lengths of grafted poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) on their surfaces. The PSt nanoparticles were synthesized by free radical copolymerization of styrene monomer with PNIPAAm macromonomers in mixed ethanol/water solvents. The grafted PNIPAAm densities on the PSt nanoparticle surfaces can be controlled by varying polymerization conditions such as reaction temperature and initiator concentrations. The nanoparticle sizes and densities of grafted PNIPAAm on their surfaces significantly affected temperature-response, which was investigated by dynamic laser light scattering. The larger PSt nanoparticle sizes and higher grafted PNIPAAm densities showed a more significant decrease in hydrodynamic diameters when temperature of dispersed solutions was raised above lower critical solution temperature of the linear PNIPAAm. The molecular weight of grafted PNIPAAm on nanoparticle surfaces had no relationship with a visible decrease in hydrodynamic diameter.

0347177393	Clustering Induced Collapse of a Polymer Brush	Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains were grafted onto a spherical thermally sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) microgel with a low critical solution temperature of ∼32 °C. The shrinking of the microgel at higher temperatures led to a dramatic decrease in its surface area, providing a convenient way to increase the grafting density of a polymer brush. As expected, we observed a repulsion-induced stretching of the PEO chains at the initial stage of the shrinking. However, as the grafting density increases, an unexpected collapse of the grafted PEO chains was observed, which can be attributed to a long predicted n-clustering attractive interaction among densely grafted polymer chains.

12844252470	Modified structural model for predicting particle size in the microemulsion and emulsion polymerization of styrene under microwave irradiation	In this study, the microemulsion and emulsion polymerization of styrene at 70 °C in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, surfactant) and potassium persulfate (KPS, initiator) was conducted under microwave radiation. Laser light scattering was used to characterize the resultant polystyrene latex particles formed at different polymerization stages. The influence of the initial emulsion composition, that is, the SDS, KPS, and styrene concentrations, on the final particle size led us to a simple modified structural model in which we considered the stabilization effects of both the surfactant and the ionic end groups generated from the initiator. This model extended the application of the previous Wu plot from microemulsion polymerization to emulsion polymerization. Using this model, we were not only able to control the particle size but were also able to predict the monomer concentration dependence of the number of the resultant latex particles and the effect of diluting the reaction mixture on the resultant particle size.

A comparison to the coil-to-globule and the globule-to-coil transitions revealed a hysteresis in the globule-to-coil transition. Our results also confirmed the existence of two additional thermodynamically stable states between the coil and the globule states, namely, the crumpled coil and the molten globule.

Our results revealed that the stereocomplex was caused by weak interactions, and could be melted at higher temperatures. In THF, the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions could be clearly separated at lower temperatures, and the structure of aggregated chains was linear. In acetone, a more compact structure was obtained, which was corroborated by the fact that the stereocomplex had a higher melting temperature than in THF. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
