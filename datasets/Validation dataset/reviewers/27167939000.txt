20544431513	Effects of a large dose of nitroglycerin on the apoptosis as well as the expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 in myocardial cells of rats with ischemia reperfusion injury in vitro	Aim: To investigate whether nitroglycerin has direct influence on the apoptosis and expressions of Bax and Bcl-2 in the myocardial cells of rats with ischemia reperfusion injury in vitro. Methods: Thirty SD rats were randomly divided into nitroglycerin group (n=15) and control group (n=15). Rat models of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (ischemia for 30 minutes, reperfusion for 120 minutes) in vitro were established, then the rats were injected with large dose of nitroglycerin (15 μg per hour, 950 mL/L alcohol as the solvent) or 950 mL/L alcohol (3 μL per hour) respectively at the beginning of reperfusion. After reperfusion, the tissues in the ischemic area were collected and made into paraffin sections, which were tested by TUNAL method for apoptosis and immunohistochemical method for levels of Bcl-2 and Bax protein. Results: The occurrence rate of apoptosis was obviously higher in the nitroglycerin group [(35.2±6.7)%] than in the control group [(5.2 ±0.8)%] (t=28.1, P < 0.01). The level of Bcl-2 expression in the control group (5.7±1.3) was obviously stronger than that in the nitroglycerin group(1.8±0.8) (t=11.9, P < 0.01); while that of Bax expression was obviously weaker in the control group (5.9±1.3) than in the nitroglycerin group (9.1±1.3) (t=9.2, P < 0.01). Conclusion: A large dose of nitroglycerin accelerates the myocardial apoptosis of rats with ischemia/reperfusion in vitro, enhances the expression of Bax protein but reduces that of Bcl-2 protein. The regulation of Bcl-2/ Bax by large dose of nitroglycerin may be one of the mechanisms in its acceleration on apoptosis.

19944429185	Role of Omi/HtrA2 in apoptotic cell death after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion	Background - Omi/HtrA2 is a proapoptotic mitochondrial serine protease involved in caspase-dependent as well as caspase-independent cell death. However, the role of Omi/HtrA2 in the apoptotic cell death that occurs in vivo under pathological conditions remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether Omi/HtrA2 plays an important role in postischemic myocardial apoptosis. Methods and Results - Male adult mice were subjected to 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion and treated with vehicle or ucf-101, a novel and specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, 10 minutes before reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion significantly increased cytosolic Omi/HtrA2 content and markedly increased apoptosis. Treatment with ucf-101 exerted significant cardioprotective effects, as evidenced by less terminal dUTP nick end-labeling staining, a lower incidence of DNA ladder fragmentation, and smaller infarct size. Furthermore, treatment with ucf-101 before reperfusion attenuated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein degradation and inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities. Conclusion - Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that ischemia/reperfusion results in Omi/HtrA2 translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via a protease activity-dependent, caspase-mediated pathway.

20544467483	Effect of inducible nitric oxide synthase on the cardiac function and myocardial apoptosis in rats induced by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation	Aim: To investigate the relationship of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in heart with myocardial ischemic injury and beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) stimulation. Methods: Fifty male Fisher rats were used in this study. Twenty rats (3 to 5 months old) were randomly divided into young control group (n = 10) and young interventional group (n = 10), another 20 aging rats (24 to 25 months old) were randomized into aging control group (n = 10) and aging interventional group (n = 10). The myocardial tissues of the rest 5 young rats and 5 aging rats were taken after being killed for Western blot study of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Rats in the young and aging control groups were treated with saline before experiment, while those in the young and aging interventional groups received intervention of specific iNOS blocker - 1 400 W. After interventions of saline and 1 400 W and perfusion of 50% normal coronary flow reduction for 30 minutes, the isolated hearts were pumped with isoproterenol (Iso) stimulation for 30 minutes. Results: Thirty minutes after myocardial infarction, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and rate of rise and decrease of left ventricular pressure ( ± dp/dt) in all the groups were decreased by 13% to 45% as compared with the basic values. Thirty minutes after Iso was pumped into the rats of the young control and interventional groups, the ventricular functions were recovered partially, which was manifested by increase of LVDP and ± dp/dt. In contrast, after Iso was pumped into the rats of the aging control group, the cardiac insufficiency induced by ischemia was not ameliorated, but the cardiac injury was aggregated further, which was manifested that LVDP and ± dp/dt were further decreased by 43% to 60%. Western blot studies showed a phenotypic change of increase in iNOS expression in the aging heart, the total nitric oxide (NO) production after ischemia for 60 minutes in the four groups were (134. 78 ± 10. 55), (138. 78 ± 19. 10), (280. 50 ± 29. 58), (127. 84 ± 13. 58) μmol/L respectively, it was significantly higher in the aging control group than in the other three groups (P < 0. 01). The 1 400 W treatment stopped the dysfunctional response to Iso stimulation, blocked the synthesis of NO and 3-nitrotyrosion, and reduced the release and activity of myocardial apoptosis caspase-3. The content of 3-nitrotyrosin in the aging interventional group [(18. 72 ± 0. 56) μmol/g] was obviously lower than that in the aging control group [(43. 94 ± 1.01) μmol/g] (P < 0. 01), but had insignificant difference from that in the young control group [(14. 12 ± 0. 14) μmol/g] ( P > 0. 05). The myocardial content of caspase-3 (DEVD-pNA) was obviously lower in the aging interventional group [(189. 57 ± 12. 18) mmol/g] than in the aging control group [(524. 52 ± 13. 76) mmol/g] ( P < 0. 01). Conclusion: Aging induces increased levels of iNOS expression in heart. Upregulation of iNOS can release NO rapidly in responses to ischemia and Iso stimulation. Consequently, the increased nitrative stress results in activation of apoptotic process, and predisposes the aging heart to cardiac dysfunction and myocardial ischemic injury.

30944460125	Nitrate tolerance aggravates postischemic myocardial apoptosis and impairs cardiac functional recovery after ischemia	Objectives: This study examined the effects of nitrate tolerance (NT) on myocardial ischemia reperfusion (MI/R) injury and elucidated the potential mechanisms involved. Furthermore, the effects of GSH on postischemic myocardial apoptosis in NT rats were investigated. Methods and results: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive nitroglycerin (60 μg/kg/h) or saline for 12 h followed by 40 min of MI and 4 h of reperfusion. Myocardial apoptosis, infarct size, nitrotyrosine formation, plasma CK and LDH activity, and cardiac function were determined. MI/R resulted in significant apoptotic cell death, which was further increased in animals with NT. In addition, NT further increased plasma CK and LDH activity, enlarged infarct size, and impaired cardiac functional recovery after ischemia. Myocardial nitrotyrosine, a footprint for cytotoxic reactive nitrogen species formation, was further enhanced in the NT heart after MI/R. Treatment of NT animals with exogenous GSH inhibited nitrotyrosine formation, reduced apoptosis, decreased infarct size, and improved cardiac functional recovery. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that nitrate tolerance markedly enhances MI/R injury and that increased peroxynitrite formation likely plays a role in this pathologic process. In addition, our results suggest that GSH could decrease peroxynitrite formation and reduce MI/R injury in nitrate tolerant hearts. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

32444444967	Inhibition of iNOS protects the aging heart against β-adrenergic receptor stimulation-induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial ischemic injury	Background. β-adrenergic receptor (AR) and aging are two major contributors to pathogenesis of perioperative myocardial ischemia and infarction. This study compared the response to β-AR stimulation in the young and aging heart and examined the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in aging related myocardial ischemic injury and its relation to β-AR stimulation. Material and methods. Isolated perfused hearts from young (3-5 months) and aging (24-25 months) rats were subjected to 60 min of 50% coronary flow reduction and 30 min of isoproterenol (Iso) stimulation starting at 30 min of ischemia. The rats were randomized to receive vehicle or 1400W (a selective iNOS inhibitor) at 24 h (2 mg/kg, i.p.) and 1 h (1 mg/kg, i.p.) pre-ischemia. Results. The 30 min of myocardial ischemia resulted in cardiac dysfunction as indicated by a 13 to 45% of reduction in left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and ±dp/dt

Methods: Isolated pulmonary artery ring was perfused and the tension of the vessel was measured. Results: U50,488H relaxed the pulmonary artery ring in a dose-dependent manner and the effect was abolished by nor-binaltorphimine, a selective κ-opioid receptor antagonist.

33745032835	Role of ERK1/2 in the anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects of nitric oxide after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion	Objective: Experimental results from cultured cells suggest that there is cross-talk between nitric oxide (NO) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in their anti-apoptotic effect. However, the cross-talk between these two molecules in either direction has not been confirmed in the whole organ or whole animal level. The aim of the present study was to determine whether ERK may play a role in the anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects of NO in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Methods: Isolated perfused mouse hearts were subjected to 20 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion and treated with vehicle or an NO donor (SNAP, 10 μM) during reperfusion. To determine the role of ERK1/2 in the anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects of NO, hearts were pre-treated (10 min before ischemia) with U0126, a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor (1 μM). Results: Treatment with SNAP exerted significant cardioprotective effects as evidenced by reduced cardiac apoptosis (TUNEL and caspase 3 activity, p < 0.01), and improved cardiac functional recovery (p < 0.01). In addition, treatment with SNAP resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in ERK activation when compared with heart receiving vehicle. Pre-treatment with U0126 slightly increased post-ischemic myocardial apoptosis but had no significant effect on cardiac functional recovery in this isolated perfused heart model. However, treatment with U0126 completely blocked SNAP-induced ERK activation and markedly, although not completely, inhibited the cardioprotection exerted by SNAP. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that nitric oxide exerts its anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects, at least in part, by activation of ERK in ischemic/reperfused heart. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

33748186515	U50,488H depresses pulmonary pressure in rats subjected to chronic hypoxia	In this study, we determined the effect of U50,488H (a selective κ-opioid receptor agonist) on pulmonary artery in rats and investigated its prevention and treatment effects on hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH). Isolated pulmonary arterial rings were superfused and the tension of the vessel was measured. The model of HPH was developed and indexes for hemodynamics and right ventricular hypertrophy were measured. We found that U50,488H relaxed the pulmonary artery rings in a dose-dependent manner and the effect was abolished by nor-binaltorphimine, a selective κ-opioid receptor antagonist. Intravenous administration of U50,488H significantly lowered mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) in normal rats and this effect was also abolished by nor-binaltorphimine. Hypoxia induced severe HPH in rats and intraperitoneal administration of U50,488H (every other day) during chronic hypoxia reduced mPAP and attenuated right ventricular hypertrophy compared with the control group. Moreover, acute intravenous administration of U50,488H after the rats subjected to chronic hypoxia for 4 weeks significantly lowered mPAP. Thus, U50,488H has significant vasorelaxant effect in rat pulmonary artery and has certain preventive and therapeutic application in HPH. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

34147092160	The effect of compound nutrients on stress-induced changes in serum IL-2, IL-6 and TNF-α levels in rats	The effect of compound nutrients on serum concentrations of the cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 in immobilization and cold water-immersion stressed rat were investigated. Oral (gavage) administration of compound nutrients was found to attenuate the acute and chronic immobilization and cold water-immersion stress-induced increase in serum IL-6 level and decrease in IL-2 level. Compound nutrients exerted different effects on TNF-α level in two different models studied, with reduced serum TNF-α level in acute stress, while no significant effect in chronic stress. These results suggested that compound nutrients might be proposed as a possible candidate in the research or therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

34548380362	Mechanisms Involved in the Hypotensive Effect of a κ-Opioid Receptor Agonist in Hypertensive Rats	Background: It remains unclear whether the activation of κ-opioid receptors has strong hypotensive effects under hypertensive condition, and the underlying mechanisms have not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present study is designed to use spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) to investigate the effects of a κ-opioid receptor agonist on the regulation of urinary formation in hypertensive conditions and to identify its underlying mechanism. Methods: The hemodynamics, urine flow rate, vasodilatation of isolated renal artery, and plasma hormones were determined by physiological in vivo experimental technique, isolated artery perfusion technique and radioimmunoassay. Results: Intravenous administration of U50, 448H significantly decreased mean arterial blood pressure in both Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHR. However, the blood pressure vasodepressor effect of U50, 448H was much more profound in SHR than in WKY rats. Administration of U50, 448H in SHR not only caused significantly greater effects in increasing urine volume and decreasing plasma anti-diuretic hormone than in WKY rats, but also caused significant reduction in plasma angiotensin. Moreover, vasodilatory effect of U50, 488H was significantly exhibited in the renal artery segments isolated from SHR. All effects described above were abolished by nor-binaltorphimine. Conclusions: These data indicate that the depressor effect of U50, 488H in SHR is significantly stronger than that in WKY rats, and the effect is mediated or modulated by a κ-opioid receptor sensitive mechanism. The sensitized hypotensive effect of U50, 488H in SHR may be attributed, in part, to its vasodilatory effect, enhanced beneficial effect on plasma humoral factors, and stronger diuretic effect in these hypertensive animals. © 2007 IMSS.

34848913474	TNFα-initiated oxidative/nitrative stress mediates cardiomyocyte apoptosis in traumatic animals	Whole body non-penetrating trauma causes myocardial infarction in humans and mechanical trauma (MT) results in cardiac dysfunction in animals. Our recent study demonstrated that incubation of cardiomyocytes with plasma isolated from MT animals causes significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis that can be blocked by neutralization of TNFα. The present study attempted to obtain direct in vivo evidence to support that overproduction of TNFα plays a causative role in trauma-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Non-lethal MT caused significant TNFα overproduction (2.4-fold at 1.5 h after MT) and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis (starting 3 h and peaking 12 h after MT). Pharmacological inhibition of TNFα with etanercept or TNFα gene deletion reduced post-trauma myocyte apoptosis (P < 0.01). Expression of iNOS and NADPH oxidase, overproduction of NO and O

39849088716	Reduced cardiotropic response to insulin in spontaneously hypertensive rats: Role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-initiated signaling	OBJECTIVES: Vascular insulin resistance plays a crucial pathogenic role in the development of genetic hypertension. However, it is not known whether hypertension-associated myocardial insulin resistance also exists, and whether this is involved in the development of related diseases, such as hypertensive heart failure. The present study aimed to determine whether hypertension- associated myocardial insulin resistance exists, in addition to any underlying mechanism. METHODS: Ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated from male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and myocyte shortening and intracellular Ca transient were assessed, as was any signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Compared with WKY rats, insulin-stimulated myocardial glucose uptake was blunted in SHR. More importantly, the positive inotropic effect of insulin was significantly reduced in SHR myocytes. Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3) kinase p85 expression and insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation were reduced in SHR cardiomyocytes, but were markedly restored when animals were treated with rosiglitazone for 14 days. Pretreatment with an Akt inhibitor abolished the inotropic effect induced by insulin in rosiglitazone-treated SHR cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained demonstrate that insulin resistance exists in SHR cardiomyocytes as manifested by both reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and an impaired contractile response to insulin, which is attributable to decreased PPARγ expression and subsequent impairment in PI-3 kinase/Akt signaling. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

34250015316	Role of iNOS-derived reactive nitrogen species and resultant nitrative stress in leukocytes-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion	Polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) accumulation/activation has been implicated as a primary mechanism underlying MI/R injury. Recent studies have demonstrated that PMNs express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and produce toxic reactive nitrogen species (RNS). However, the role of iNOS-derived reactive nitrogen species and resultant nitrative stress in PMN-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI/R remains unclear. Male adult rats were subjected to 30 min of myocardial ischemia followed by 5 h of reperfusion. Animals were randomized to receive one of the following treatments: MI/R+vehicle; MI/R+L-arginine; PMN depletion followed by MI/R+vehicle; PMN depletion followed by MI/R+L-arginine; MI/R+1400 W; MI/R+1400 W+L-arginine and MI/R+ FeTMPyP. Ischemia/reperfusion-induced and L-arginine-enhanced nitrative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis were determined. PMN depletion virtually abolished ischemia/reperfusion- induced PMN accumulation, attenuated ischemic/reperfusion-induced and L-arginine-enhanced nitrative stress, and reduced ischemic/reperfusion-induced and L-arginine-enhanced cardiomyocyte apoptosis (P values all <0.01). Pre-treatment with 1400 W, a highly selective iNOS inhibitor, had no effect on PMN accumulation in the ischemic/reperfused tissue. However, this treatment reduced ischemia/reperfusion-induced and L-arginine-enhanced nitrative stress and cardiomyocyte apoptosis to an extent that is comparable as that seen in PMN depletion group. Treatment with FeTMPyP, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, had no effect on either PMN accumulation or total NO production. However, treatment with this ONOO

84877267053	Lymphotoxin-α is a novel adiponectin expression suppressor following myocardial ischemia/reperfusion	Recent clinical observations demonstrate adiponectin (APN), an adipocytokine with potent cardioprotective actions, is significantly reduced following myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion (MI/R). However, mechanisms responsible for MI/ R-induced hypoadiponectinemia remain incompletely understood. Adult male mice were subjected to 30-min MI followed by varying reperfusion periods. Adipocyte APN mRNA and protein expression and plasma APN and TNFα concentrations were determined. APN expression/production began to decline 3 h after reperfusion (reaching nadir 12 h after reperfusion), returning to control levels 7 days after reperfusion. Plasma TNFα levels began to increase 1 h after reperfusion, peaking at 3 h and returning to control levels 24 h after reperfusion. TNFα knockout significantly increased plasma APN levels 12 h after reperfusion but failed to improve APN expression/ production 72 h after reperfusion. In contrast, TNF receptor-1 (TNFR1) knockout significantly restored APN expression 12 and 72 h after reperfusion, suggesting that other TNFR1 binding cytokines contribute to MI/R-induced APN suppression. Among many cytokines increased after MI/R, lymphotoxin-α (LTα) was the only cytokine remaining elevated 24-72 h after reperfusion. LTα knockout did not augment APN levels 12 h post-reperfusion, but did so by 72 h. Finally, in vitro treatment of adipocytes with TNFα and LTα at concentrations seen in MI/R plasma additively inhibited APN expression/ production in TNFR1-dependent fashion. Our study demonstrates for the first time that LTα is a novel suppressor of APN expression and contributes to the sustained hypoadiponectinemia following MI/R. Combining anti-TNFα with anti-LTα strategies may achieve the best effects restoring APN in MI/R patients. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.

84896989506	Dickkopf-3 attenuates pressure overload-induced cardiac remodelling	AimsDickkopf-3 (DKK3), a secreted protein in the Dickkopf family, is expressed in various tissues, including the heart, and has been shown to play an important role in tissue development. However, the biological function of DKK3 in the heart remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to examine the role of DKK3 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.Methods and resultsWe performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies using DKK3 cardiac-specific transgenic (TG) mice and DKK3 knockout (KO) mice (C57BL/6J background). Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by aortic banding. Cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by echocardiographic, haemodynamic, pathological, and molecular analyses. Our results demonstrated that the loss of DKK3 exaggerated pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction, whereas the overexpression of DKK3 protected the heart against pressure overload-induced cardiac remodelling. These beneficial effects were associated with the inhibition of the ASK1-JNK/p38 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-c-Jun N-terminal kinase/p38) signalling cascade. Parallel in vitro experiments confirmed these in vivo observations. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that physical interactions occurred between DKK3 and ASK1. Moreover, rescue experiments indicated that, in DKK3 TG mice, the activation of ASK1 using a cardiac-specific conditional ASK1 transgene reduced the functionality of DKK3 in response to pressure overload; furthermore, the inactivation of ASK1 by dominant-negative ASK1 rescued pressure overload-induced cardiac abnormalities in DKK3 KO mice.ConclusionTaken together, our findings indicate that DKK3 acts as a cardioprotective regulator of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and that this function largely occurs via the regulation of ASK1-JNK/p38 signalling. © 2014 The Author.

4344702048	Early anti-apoptosis treatment reduces myocardial infarct size after a prolonged reperfusion	Objective: Significant myocardial apoptosis occurs in ischemia/reperfused hearts. However, the contribution of apoptosis to the development of myocardial injury remains controversial. The present study attempted to obtain evidence that inhibition of apoptosis at early reperfusion can reduce myocardial infarction after prolonged reperfusion. Methods: Adult male rats were subjected to 30 min ischemia and 4 (apoptosis assay) or 24 h (myocardial infarction determination) of reperfusion and treated with vehicle, SB 239063, insulin or insulin plus wortmannin. Results: Treatment with SB 239063 or insulin markedly decreased myocardial apoptosis (10.6 ± 1.5% and 7.9 ± 0.9% respectively, P < 0.01 vs. vehicle) and significantly reduced infarct size (43 ± 3.6% and 35 ± 2.9%, respectively, P < 0.01 vs. vehicle). Most interestingly, inhibition of insulin signaling with wortmannin to block insulin signaling not only blocked insulin's anti-apoptotic effect, but also abolished its infarct reduction property. Conclusion: These data indicate that apoptosis contributes to the development of myocardial infarction, and inhibition of apoptosis at early reperfusion reduces the myocardial infarction.

46749156708	Angiotensin II promotes NO production, inhibits apoptosis and enhances adhesion potential of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells	Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) participate in the processes of postnatal neovascularization and re-endothelialization in response to tissue ischemia and endothelial injury. The level of EPCs present has been found to be directly associated with the outcome of cardiovascular diseases, and could be regulated by stimulatory or inhibitory factors. Given the close relationship between angiotensin II (AngII) and the cardiovascular system, we investigated the effect of AngII on the activities of bone marrow (BM)-derived EPCs. Cells were isolated from BM of rats by density gradient centrifugation. Administration of AngII significantly promoted nitric oxide (NO) release, inhibited EPC apoptosis and enhanced EPC adhesion potential. All of these AngII-mediated effects on EPCs were attenuated by pretreatment with valsartan or L-NAME. Moreover, both LY294002 and wortmannin abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of AngII. Western blot analyses indicated that endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein and phosphorylated Akt increased with the treatment of AngII in EPCs. Thus, AngII improved several activities of EPCs through AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R), which may represent a possible mechanism linking AngII and AT1R with angiogenesis. Additionally, AngII-induced NO synthesis through eNOS in EPCs regulates apoptosis and adhesion, and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway has an essential role in AngII-induced antiapoptosis signaling. © 2008 IBCB, SIBS, CAS All rights reserved.

51549083504	Autoantibody against AT1 receptor from preeclamptic patients induces vasoconstriction through angiotensin receptor activation	Preeclampsia is a serious pathologic complication during pregnancy, and its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated that autoantibodies against angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1-AA) are present in women with preeclampsia. However, their role in the development of hypertension in preeclamptic patients has never been previously investigated. The present study was designed to determine whether AT1-AA isolated from the sera of preeclamptic patients causes vascular constriction and, if so, to further investigate the cellular receptors that mediate their vasoactivity. Blood samples were collected from 49 pregnant women (preeclampsia = 31, control = 18) and AT1-AA was detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Vasoconstrictive effect of purified IgG from the sera of either preeclamptic patients or normal pregnant women was determined in isolated rat thoracic aorta, arteriae cerebri media and coronary artery. Compared with normal pregnant women, frequency of AT1-AA positive samples was markedly increased in preeclamptic patients (80.7 vs. 5.6%, P < 0.01). In isolated thoracic aortic rings, middle cerebral artery and coronary artery segments, AT1-AA induced vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent fashion (P < 0.01). The vasoconstrictive effect of AT1-AA was completely blocked by losartan, an AT1-receptor antagonist. These data demonstrate that the AT1-AA causes significant vascular constriction in large conduit vessel as well as small resistant vessels though activation of the AT1 receptor. These results suggest that overproduction of AT1-AA is a novel risk factor in pregnant women and may play a causative role in the development of hypertension and vascular injury in preeclamptic patients. © 2008 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

58449125170	Rosiglitazone inhibits hypercholesterolaemia-induced myeloperoxidase upregulation - A novel mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of PPAR agonists	Aims: Hypercholesterolaemia and myeloperoxidase (MPO) overexpression are two well-recognized risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists have recently been shown to reduce ischaemic heart injury in hypercholesterolaemic animals. However, whether PPARγ agonists may exert their cardioprotective effects by eliminating those risk factors that increase ischaemic injury remains unknown. Methods and results: Male New Zealand rabbits were fed with a normal or a high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks, treated with vehicle or rosiglitazone (RSG, 3 mg/kg/day for the last 5 weeks) and subjected to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (1 h/4 h). MPO expression, activity, and distribution, cardiac caspase-3 activity, and myocardial infarct size were determined. Diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia caused a significant increase in neutrophil MPO expression/activity (7.2-/5.4-fold). Hypercholesterolaemia also tripled MPO activity in ischaemic/reperfused hearts when compared with rabbits fed with a normal diet. Surprisingly, MPO immunostaining was not only observed in perivascular and extracellular spaces in ischaemic/reperfused hearts, but also in cardiomyocytes. This intracardiomyocyte MPO staining was further intensified by hypercholesterolaemia. There is a strong positive correlation between cardiac MPO activity and caspase-3 activity, and treatment with an MPO inhibitor significantly reduced post-ischaemic caspase-3 activation. Treatment with RSG markedly inhibited hypercholesterolaemia-induced leucocyte MPO overexpression and activation, reduced MPO activity in ischaemic/reperfused hearts, decreased caspase-3 activity, and reduced myocardial infarct size (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that hypercholesterolaemia and MPO overexpression are causally related and that PPARγ agonists may have great therapeutic value in ischaemic heart disease patients with multiple complications such as hypercholesterolaemia and diabetes. © The Author 2008.

Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that calcium plays a critical role in the signal transduction pathway leading to apoptosis. However, whether or not calcium antagonists may reduce myocardial apoptosis induced by ischaemia-reperfusion, and thus decrease myocardial infarction, has not been directly investigated. 2. The present study investigated the effects of benidipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, on myocardial infarct size, apoptosis, necrosis and cardiac functional recovery in rabbits subjected to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R, 45 min/240 min). Ten minutes prior to coronary occlusion, rabbits were treated with vehicle or benidipine (10 μg kg

77349124428	Cardiomyocyte-derived adiponectin is biologically active in protecting against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury	Adiponectin (APN) has traditionally been viewed as an adipocyte-specific endocrine molecule with cardioprotective effects. Recent studies suggest that APN is also expressed in cardiomyocytes. However, biological significances of this locally produced APN remain completely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the pathological and pharmacological significance of cardiac-derived APN in cardiomyocyte pathology. Adult cardiomyocytes from wild-type littermates (WT) or gene-deficient mice were pretreated with vehicle (V) or rosiglitazone (RSG) for 6 h followed by simulated ischemia-reperfusion (SI/R, 3 h/12 h). Compared with WT cardiomyocytes, myocytes from APN knockout (APN-KO) mice sustained greater SI/R injury, evidenced by greater oxidative/nitrative stress, caspase-3 activity, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release (P < 0.05). Myocytes from adiponectin receptor 1 knockdown (AdipoR1-KD) or AdipoR1-KD/ AdipoR2-KO mice had slightly increased SI/R injury, but the difference was not statistically significant. RSG significantly (P < 0.01) increased APN mRNA and protein expression, upregulated AdipoR1/ AdipoR2 expression, reduced SI/R-induced apoptosis, and decreased LDH release in WT cardiomyocytes. However, the anti-oxidative/ anti-nitrative and cell protective effects of RSG were completely lost in APN-KO cardiomyocytes (P > 0.05 vs. vehicle group), although a comparable degree of AdipoR1/AdipoR2 upregulation was observed. The upregulatory effect of RSG on APN mRNA and protein expression was significantly potentiated in AdipoR1-KD/AdipoR2-KO cardiomyocytes. However, the cellular protective effects of RSG were significantly blunted, although not completely lost, in these cells. These results demonstrated that cardiomyocyte APN is biologically active in protecting cells against SI/R injury. Moreover, this locally produced APN achieves its protective effect primarily through paracrine/autocrine activation of APN receptors. Copyright © 2010 American Physiological Society.

77949316000	Myeloperoxidase increased cardiomyocyte protein nitration in mice subjected to nonlethal mechanical trauma	Nonlethal mechanical trauma causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis which contributes to posttraumatic cardiac dysfunction. Apoptosis is positively correlated with protein nitration in the traumatic heart. However, the mechanisms responsible for the cardiomyocyte protein nitration remain unclear. The present study was designed to identify whether myeloperoxidase may contribute to protein nitration in nonlethal mechanical trauma and subsequent cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and, if so, to determine the possible mechanisms responsible. We used Noble-Collip drum to make nonlethal traumatic mice models. Male adult C57B16/J mice were placed in the Noble-Collip drum and subjected to a total of 200 revolutions at a rate of 40 r/min. Then myeloperoxidase activity and release, protein nitration, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, endothelial function and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression were determined. Nonlethal mechanical trauma was characterized by the 100% survival rate during the first 24 h after trauma, the lack of circulatory shock and without direct heart injury. However, myeloperoxidase activity significantly increased 6 h after trauma, and reached a maximum level 12 h after trauma. Obviously, protein nitration and cardiomyocyte apoptosis increased 12 h after trauma and could be blocked by administration of R15.7, a monoclonal antibody that blocks polymorphonuclear neutrophils adhesion. Moreover, endothelial dysfunction and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 upregulation were observed in traumatic mice. Our present study demonstrated for the first time that myeloperoxidase caused protein nitration and cardiomyocyte apoptosis in nonlethal traumatic mice. Inhibition of polymorphonuclear neutrophils adhesion and antinitration treatments may be novel measures in reducing posttraumatic cardiomyocyte apoptosis and secondary heart injury. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

77953050564	Clinical Outcomes With the Epicholorohydrin-Modified Porcine Aortic Heart Valve: A 15-Year Follow-Up	Background: The epichlorohydrin (ECH) modified porcine aortic heart valve, first clinically utilized in 1989, obtained 2006 approval from the State Food and Drug Administration in China. This study analyzes the 15-year follow-up data of patient recipients of the ECH-modified valve. Methods: From 1989 to 2002, 227 patients underwent ECH valve replacement at Xijing Hospital, consisting of mitral (129), aortic (57), tricuspid (26), and double (mitral and aortic[15]) valvular replacements. The mean age of patients was 42 ± 7.9 years, and 50% were in New York Heart Association class III or IV. Follow-up included 8,885 patient-years, and was 96.5% complete. Results: At 15 years, actuarial survival and freedom from valve-related death were, respectively, 58.1% ± 13.7% and 90.0% ± 6.8% (aortic group), 49.0% ± 15.4% and 89.2% ± 5.7% (mitral group), 65.3% ± 12.4% and 83.6% ± 10.8% (tricuspid group), and 40.7% ± 16.0% and 83.3% ± 15.2% (double-valve replacement group). Actuarial freedom from structural valve deterioration was 91.1% ± 6.2%, 88.3% ± 8.1%, 100%, and 66.7% ± 27.2% in the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and double-valve groups, respectively. Actuarial freedom from reoperation necessity was 95.7% ± 4.3%, 85.8% ± 10.4%, 80.4% ± 13.4%, and 55.6% ± 24.8% in the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and double-valve groups, respectively. Actuarial freedom from incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis was 97.5% ± 2.5%, 93.4% ± 4.9%, 90.0% ± 9.5%, and 83.3 ± 15.2% in the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and double-valve groups, respectively. Actuarial freedom from thromboembolism was 89.4% ± 7.7%, 92.1% ± 4.7%, 77.9% ± 14.1%, and 50.0% ± 25.0% in the aortic, mitral, tricuspid, and double-valve groups, respectively. Conclusions: The epichlorohydrin-modified porcine valve has excellent durability and clinical performance in long-term follow-up. © 2010 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

77955278430	Reduced vascular responsiveness to adiponectin in hyperlipidemic rats-mechanisms and significance	Deficiency of adiponectin (APN), an adipocyte-derived vascular protective molecule, contributes to diabetic vascular injury. The current study determined whether obesity/hyperlipidemia may alter the vascular response to APN, and investigated the involved mechanisms and pathologic significance. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a regular or high-fat diet (HF) for 4-16. weeks. Circulating APN levels, aortic pAMPK/AMPK, peNOS/eNOS, and APN receptor expression levels were determined. Compared to time-matched animals fed control diet, plasma APN levels in HF-diet animals were significantly increased at 8. weeks, and rapidly declined thereafter. Despite unchanged or elevated circulating APN levels, phosphorylated AMPK and eNOS in vascular tissue were significantly reduced at all observed time points. Recombinant full-length APN (rAPN)-induced AMPK/eNOS phosphorylation and vasodilatation were significantly reduced in 16-week obese/hyperlipidemic aortic segments. Vascular APN receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and receptor 2 (AdipoR2) expression were significantly reduced 16. weeks after HF-diet. Pre-incubation of rAPN with obese/hyperlipidemic plasma, but not with normal plasma, significantly reduced its AMPK and eNOS activation effect, and blunted its protective effect against TNFα-induced HUVEC apoptosis. This study demonstrated for the first time that obesity/hyperlipidemia reduces vascular responsiveness to APN. Modification/inactivation of APN by unidentified factors present in obese/hyperlipidemic plasma, decreased vascular AdipoR1/R2 expression, and reduced circulating APN levels contribute to reduced vascular responsiveness to APN at different stages of the obese condition. Reduced APN bioactivity allows unmitigated TNFα pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory actions, contributing to vascular injury in obesity/hyperlipidemia. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77954911547	Methylglyoxal increases cardiomyocyte ischemia-reperfusion injury via glycative inhibition of thioredoxin activity	Diabetes mellitus (DM) is closely related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but the specific molecular basis linking DM with increased vulnerability to cardiovascular injury remains incompletely understood. Methylglyoxal (MG), a precursor to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), is increased in diabetic patient plasma, but its role in diabetic cardiovascular complications is unclear. Thioredoxin (Trx), a cytoprotective molecule with antiapoptotic function, has been demonstrated to be vulnerable to glycative inhibition, but whether Trx is glycatively inhibited by MG, thus contributing to increased cardiac injury, has never been investigated. Cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes were treated with MG (200 μM) for 6 days. The following were determined pre- and post-simulated ischemia-reperfusion (SI-R; 8 h of hypoxia followed by 3 h of reoxygenation): cardiomyocyte death/apoptosis, Trx expression and activity, AGE formation, Trx-apoptosis-regulating kinase-1 (Trx-ASK1) complex formation, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and activity. Compared with vehicle, MG significantly increased SI-R-induced cardiomyocyte LDH release and apoptosis (P < 0.01). Prior to SI-R, Trx activity was reduced in MG-treated cells, but Trx expression was increased moderately. Moreover, Trx-ASK1 complex formation was reduced, and both p38 MAPK activity and phosphorylation were increased. To investigate the effects of MG on Trx directly, recombinant human Trx (hTrx) was incubated with MG in vitro. Compared with vehicle, MG incubation markedly increased CML formation (a glycation footprint) and inhibited Trx activity. Finally, glycation inhibitor aminoguanidine administration during MG treatment of cultured cells reduced AGE formation, increased Trx activity, restored Trx-ASK1 interaction, and reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation and activity, caspase-3 activation, and LDH release (P < 0.01). We demonstrated for the first time that methylglyoxal sensitized cultured cardiomyocytes to SI-R injury by posttranslational modification of Trx via glycation. Therapeutic interventions scavenging AGE precursors may attenuate ischemic-reperfusion injury in hyperglycemic state diseases such as diabetes. Copyright © 2010 the American Physiological Society.

77956627998	Triage during the week of the Sichuan earthquake: A review of utilized patient triage, care, and disposition procedures	Objectives: There exists no standard hospital emergency department (ED) triage procedure model for earthquake victims. This study provides an overview of the hospital triage procedure used for patients evaluated and treated at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China, following the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Methods: Emergency triage and treatment teams were comprised of senior emergency medicine (EM) attending physician, junior EM attending physician, EM residents, and specialty surgeons. Retrospective analysis of the hospital medical records of 2283 earthquake victims was performed. Victims' demographic data, triage process and group assignments, diagnoses and dispositions were reviewed. Results: In the 2 weeks following the Wenchuan earthquake, 2283 total patients with earthquake-related injuries were admitted to our hospital. 54 victims (2.4%) were lost to follow up. Patients were triaged into four main groups: resuscitation (n = 6), urgent treatment (n = 369), delayed treatment (n = 1502), and minor injuries (n = 406). 68.9% (1572/2283) of the patients were admitted to the hospital during the 15 days after the earthquake. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1.0% (15/1572). 1304 victims were transferred to nearby hospitals after initial treatment, stabilization, or surgery. Conclusions: Proper triage strategy should be established prior to the onset of a mass casualty event and should be appropriate to both the severity of the disaster and the accepting facility resource availability. Triage methods utilizing multi-specialty treatment teams and dynamic hospital-wide coordination are critical for efficient, efficacious patient management. Hopefully, sharing with the emergency medicine community the arduous challenges we faced in the wake of the Wenchuan earthquake will be useful for planning the response to future disasters. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

77957738572	Adiponectin resistance and vascular dysfunction in the hyperlipidemic state	Insulin plays an important role in the stimulation of vascular nitric oxide production, with both short term (vasomotility and anti-thrombotic effects) and long term (smooth muscle cell growth and migration inhibition) benefits. Impaired vasodilatory response to insulin, the hallmark of vascular insulin resistance (IR), has important implications for circulatory pathophysiology. An association between adipokines and IR has been observed in both diabetic and nondiabetic states. Adiponectin (APN) is an insulin-sensitizing adipokine known to stimulate skeletal muscle fatty acid (FA) oxidation and reduce lipid accumulation. Recent demonstrations of potential cross-talk between APN and insulin in vascular function regulation are particularly interesting. The lipid accumulation observed after chronic high-fat (HF) diets and in the obese state may reduce vascular response to APN, a pathologic state termed as APN resistance. This review highlights the importance of insulin sensitivity and APN activity in the maintenance of endothelial function. It explores the relationships between vascular IR and APN resistance in the hyperlipidemic pathological condition, representative of the metabolic syndrome. The investigation of vascular insulin and APN resistance provides not only better understanding of vascular pathophysiology, but also an opportunity for therapeutic targeting in individuals affected by the metabolic syndrome. © 2010 CPS and SIMM All rights reserved.

79551492488	Insulin says NO to cardiovascular disease	It is well recognized that insulin resistance found in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Since its discovery in the 1920s, insulin has been used as an essential therapeutic agent in diabetes for blood glucose management. Recent studies demonstrate that insulin signalling is essential for normal cardiovascular function, and lack of it (i.e. insulin resistance) will result in cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. Moreover, insulin is the key component of glucoseinsulinpotassium cocktail and exerts significant cardiovascular protective effect via a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinaseprotein kinase Bendothelial nitric oxide synthase (PI3K-Akt-eNOS)-dependent signalling mechanism in addition to its metabolic modulation, which renders it a potent organ protector in multiple clinical applications. This review focuses on insulin-initiated PI3K-Akt-eNOS survival signalling, with nitric oxide as an 'end effector' delivering cardioprotection in health and disease (especially in ischaemic heart disease), and highlights the impairment of this survival signalling as a key link between insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease. © 2010 The Author.

0036231417	Enhancement of glutathione cardioprotection by ascorbic acid in myocardial reperfusion injury	The present experiment determined the effects of glutathione and ascorbic acid, the two most important hydrophilic antioxidants, on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and evaluated their relative therapeutic values. Isolated rat hearts were subjected to ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (120 min) and treated with ascorbic acid, glutathione monoethyl ester (GSHme), or their combination at the onset of reperfusion. Administration of 1 mM GSHme alone, but not 1 mM ascorbic acid alone, significantly attenuated postischemic injury (P < 0.05 versus vehicle). Most interestingly, coadministration of ascorbic acid with GSHme markedly enhanced the protective effects of GSHme (P < 0.01 versus vehicle). The protection exerted by the combination of GSHme and ascorbic acid at 1 mM each was significantly greater than that observed with 1 mM GSHme alone (P < 0.05). Moreover, treatment with GSHme alone or GSHme plus ascorbic acid markedly reduced myocardial nitrotyrosine levels, suggesting that these treatments attenuated myocardial peroxynitrite formation. These results demonstrated that 1) GSHme, but not ascorbic acid, exerted protective effects against ischemia-reperfusion injury; and 2) the protective effects of GSHme were further enhanced by coadministration with ascorbic acid, suggesting a synergistic effect between GSHme and ascorbic acid.

79959509426	Reduced cardioprotective action of adiponectin in high-fat diet-induced type II diabetic mice and its underlying mechanisms	Diabetes exacerbates ischemic heart disease morbidity and mortality via incompletely understood mechanisms. Although adiponectin (APN) reduces myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury in nondiabetic animals, whether APN's cardioprotective actions are altered in diabetes, a pathologic condition with endogenously reduced APN, has never been investigated. High-fat diet (HD)-induced diabetic mice and normal diet (ND) controls were subjected to MI via coronary artery ligation, and given vehicle or APN globular domain (gAPN, 2μg/g) 10min before reperfusion. Compared to ND mice (where gAPN exerted pronounced cardioprotection), HD mice manifested greater MI/R injury, and a tripled gAPN dose was requisite to achieve cardioprotective extent seen in ND mice (i.e., infarct size, apoptosis, and cardiac function). APN reduces MI/R injury via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent metabolic regulation and AMPK-independent antioxidative/antinitrative pathways. Compared to ND, HD mice manifested significantly blunted gAPN-induced AMPK activation, basally and after MI/R (p<0.05). Although both low-and high-dose gAPN equally attenuated MI/R-induced oxidative stress (i.e., NADPH oxidase expression and superoxide production) and nitrative stress (i.e., inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, nitric oxide production, and peroxynitrite formation) in ND mice, only high-dose gAPN efficaciously did so in HD mice. We demonstrate for the first time that HD-induced diabetes diminished both AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent APN cardioprotection, suggesting an unreported diabetic heart APN resistance. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

79960413821	Signature microRNA expression profile of essential hypertension and its novel link to human cytomegalovirus infection	BACKGROUND-: Essential hypertension has been recognized as a disease resulting from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Recent studies demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. However, little is known about the roles of miRNAs in essential hypertension. METHODS AND RESULTS-: Using microarray-based miRNA expression profiling, we compared the miRNA expressions in plasma samples from 13 hypertensive patients and 5 healthy control subjects. Twenty-seven miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. The expressions of selected miRNAs (miR-296-5p, let-7e, and a human cytomegalovirus [HCMV]-encoded miRNA, hcmv-miR-UL112) were validated independently in plasma samples from 24 hypertensive patients and 22 control subjects. The absolute expression levels of hcmv-miR-UL112, miR-296-5p, and let-7e were further determined in 127 patients and 67 control subjects (fold changes are 2.5, 0.5, and 1.7 respectively; all P<0.0001). Additionally, we demonstrated that interferon regulatory factor 1 is a direct target of hcmv-miR-UL112. Increased HCMV seropositivity and quantitative titers were found in the hypertension group compared with the control group (52.7% versus 30.9%, P=0.0005; 1870 versus 54 copies per 1 mL plasma, P<0.0001). Seropositivity, log-transformed copies of HCMV, and hcmv-miR-UL112 were independently associated with an increased risk of hypertension (odds ratio, 2.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 4.15; P=0.0005; odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.58 to 2.46; P<0.0001; and odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.98 to 3.27; P<0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS-: We report for the first time a circulating miRNA profile for hypertensive patients and demonstrate a novel link between HCMV infection and essential hypertension. These findings may reveal important insights into the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. © 2011 American Heart Association, Inc.

80051960516	Systemic adiponectin malfunction as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease	Adiponectin (Ad) is an abundant protein hormone regulatory of numerous metabolic processes. The 30kDa protein originates from adipose tissue, with full-length and globular domain circulatory forms. A collagenous domain within Ad leads to spontaneous self-assemblage into various oligomeric isoforms, including trimers, hexamers, and high-molecular-weight multimers. Two membrane-spanning receptors for Ad have been identified, with differing concentration distribution in various body tissues. The major intracellular pathway activated by Ad includes phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, which is responsible for many of Ad's metabolic regulatory, anti-inflammatory, vascular protective, and anti-ischemic properties. Additionally, several AMP-activated protein kinase-independent mechanisms responsible for Ad's anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic (resulting in cardioprotective) effects have also been discovered. Since its 1995 discovery, Ad has garnered considerable attention for its role in diabetic and cardiovascular pathology. Clinical observations have demonstrated the association of hypoadiponectinemia in patients with obesity, cardiovascular disease, and insulin resistance. In this review, we elaborate currently known information about Ad malfunction and deficiency pertaining to cardiovascular disease risk (including atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and cardiac injury), as well as review evidence supporting Ad resistance as a novel risk factor for cardiovascular injury, providing insight about the future of Ad research and the protein's potential therapeutic benefits. © 2011 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

80054916958	C1q/TNF-related proteins, a family of novel adipokines, induce vascular relaxation through the adiponectin receptor-1/AMPK/eNOS/nitric oxide signaling pathway	Objective-: Reduced plasma adiponectin (APN) in diabetic patients is associated with endothelial dysfunction. However, APN knockout animals manifest modest systemic dysfunction unless metabolically challenged. The protein family CTRPs (C1q/TNF-related proteins) has recently been identified as APN paralogs and some CTRP members share APN′s metabolic regulatory function. However, the vasoactive properties of CTRPs remain completely unknown. Methods and Results-: The vasoactivity of currently identified murine CTRP members was assessed in aortic vascular rings and underlying molecular mechanisms was elucidated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Of 8 CTRPs, CTRPs 3, 5, and 9 caused significant vasorelaxation. The vasoactive potency of CTRP9 exceeded that of APN (3-fold) and is endothelium-dependent and nitric oxide (NO)-mediated. Mechanistically, CTRP9 increased AMPK/Akt/eNOS phosphorylation and increased NO production. AMPK knockdown completely blocked CTRP9-induced Akt/eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Akt knockdown had no significant effect on CTRP9-induced AMPK phosphorylation, but blocked eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Adiponectin receptor 1, but not receptor 2, knockdown blocked CTRP9-induced AMPK/Akt/eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. Finally, preincubating vascular rings with an AMPK-inhibitor abolished CTRP9-induced vasorelaxative effects. Conclusion-: We have provided the first evidence that CTRP9 is a novel vasorelaxative adipocytokine that may exert vasculoprotective effects via the adiponectin receptor 1/AMPK/eNOS dependent/NO mediated signaling pathway. © 2011 American Heart Association.

82355170610	Hypoadiponectinaemia in diabetes mellitus type 2: Molecular mechanisms and clinical significance	1. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of adiponectin (APN) gene expression during physiologic conditions and both the clinical significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of hypoadiponectinaemia during pathologic conditions. 2. Adiponectin is a versatile cardiovascular protective factor. It plays an important role in regulating insulin sensitivity and energy homeostasis, with anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties. 3. Adiponectin gene expression is downregulated in both obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Hypoadiponectinaemia is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease in type 2 diabetic patients. 4. Exogenous supplementation of recombinant APN attenuates insulin resistance, improving metabolic disorders. Therefore, APN-targeted pharmaceutical strategies increasing circulating APN levels may be therapeutic against type 2 diabetes. 5. There is great value in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of APN gene expression during physiologic and pathologic conditions. APN biosynthesis regulation includes transcriptional expression and post-translational modification, oligomerization, and secretion. Under pathological conditions, including obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and inflammation suppress APN mRNA levels and its secretion. © 2011 The Authors.

84862831376	Essential role of caveolin-3 in adiponectin signalsome formation and adiponectin cardioprotection	Objective-Adiponectin (APN) system malfunction is causatively related to increased cardiovascular morbidity/mortality in diabetic patients. The aim of the current study was to investigate molecular mechanisms responsible for APN transmembrane signaling and cardioprotection. Methods and Results-Compared with wild-type mice, caveolin-3 knockout (Cav-3KO) mice exhibited modestly increased myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (increased infarct size, apoptosis, and poorer cardiac function recovery; P<0.05). Although the expression level of key APN signaling molecules was normal in Cav-3KO, the cardioprotective effects of APN observed in wild-type were either markedly reduced or completely lost in Cav-3KO. Molecular and cellular experiments revealed that APN receptor 1 (AdipoR1) colocalized with Cav-3, forming AdipoR1/Cav-3 complex via specific Cav-3 scaffolding domain binding motifs. AdipoR1/Cav-3 interaction was required for APN-initiated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent and AMPK-independent intracellular cardioprotective signalings. More importantly, APPL1 and adenylate cyclase, 2 immediately downstream molecules required for AMPK-dependent and AMPK-independent signaling, respectively, formed a protein complex with AdipoR1 in a Cav-3 dependent fashion. Finally, pharmacological activation of both AMPK plus protein kinase A significantly reduced myocardial infarct size and improved cardiac function in Cav-3KO animals. Conclusion-Taken together, these results demonstrated for the first time that Cav-3 plays an essential role in APN transmembrane signaling and APN anti-ischemic/ cardioprotective actions. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

84863210727	C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3, a newly identified adipokine, is a novel antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and cardioprotective molecule in the ischemic mouse heart	Background-Obesity and diabetes mellitus adversely affect postischemic heart remodeling via incompletely understood mechanisms. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3) is a newly identified adipokine exerting beneficial metabolic regulation, similar to adiponectin. The aim of the present study was to determine whether CTRP3 may regulate postischemic cardiac remodeling and cardiac dysfunction, and, if so, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods and Results-Male adult mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) via left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Both the effect of MI on endogenous CTRP3 expression/production and the effect of exogenous CTRP3 (adenovirus or recombinant CTRP3) replenishment on MI injury were investigated. MI significantly inhibited adipocyte CTRP3 expression and reduced the plasma CTRP3 level, reaching a nadir 3 days after MI. CTRP3 replenishment improved survival rate (P<0.05), restored cardiac function, attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, increased revascularization, and dramatically reduced interstitial fibrosis (all P<0.01). CTRP3 replenishment had no significant effect on cardiac AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation but significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and expression of hypoxia inducing factor-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor. Surprisingly, treatment of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells with CTRP3 did not directly affect nitric oxide production or tube formation. However, preconditioned medium from CTRP3-treated cardiomyocytes significantly enhanced human umbilical vascular endothelial cell tube formation, an effect blocked by either pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with a PI3K inhibitor or pretreatment of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells with a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor. Finally, the protective effect of adipocyte-conditioned medium against hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte injury is significantly blunted when CTRP3 is knocked down. Conclusion-CTRP3 is a novel antiapoptotic, proangiogenic, and cardioprotective adipokine, the expression of which is significantly inhibited after MI. © 2012 American Heart Association, Inc.

However, the underlying etiological factors remain complex. The presence of the autoantibody against the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-Ab), a known risk factor for pre-eclampsia, may create a suboptimal intrauterine fetal environment.

84870326369	Inhibition of CTRP9, a novel and cardiac-abundantly expressed cell survival molecule, by TNFα-initiated oxidative signaling contributes to exacerbated cardiac injury in diabetic mice	Recently identified as adiponectin (APN) paralogs, C1q/TNF-related proteins (CTRPs) share similar metabolic regulatory functions as APN. The current study determined cardiac expression of CTRPs, their potential cardioprotective function, and investigated whether and how diabetes may regulate cardiac CTRP expression. Several CTRPs are expressed in the heart at levels significantly greater than APN. Most notably, cardiac expression of CTRP9, the closest paralog of APN, exceeds APN by >100-fold. Cardiac CTRP9 expression was significantly reduced in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice. In H9c2 cells, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) strongly inhibited CTRP9 expression (>60 %), and significantly reduced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ), a known transcription factor promoting adiponectin expression. The inhibitory effect of TNF-α on PPARγ and CTRP9 was reversed by Tiron or rosiglitazone. CTRP9 knockdown significantly enhanced, whereas CTRP9 overexpression significantly attenuated simulated ischemia/reperfusion injury in H9c2 cells. In vivo CTRP9 administration to diabetic mice significantly attenuated NADPH oxidase expression and superoxide generation, reduced infarct size, and improved cardiac function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study providing evidence that downregulation of CTRP9, an abundantly expressed and novel cell survival molecule in the heart, by TNF-α- initiated oxidative PPARγ suppression contributes to exacerbated diabetic cardiac injury. Preservation of CTRP9 expression or augmentation of CTRP9-initiated signaling mechanisms may be the potential avenues for ameliorating ischemic diabetic cardiac injury. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84878881266	Increased expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor in aged mesenchymal stem cells impairs their therapeutic efficacy for attenuating myocardial infarction injury	AimsMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can ameliorate myocardial infarction (MI) injury. However, older-donor MSCs seem less efficacious than those from younger donors, and the contributing underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we determine how age-related expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) affects MSC therapeutic efficacy for MI.Methods and resultsReverse transcriptase-polymerized chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses revealed dramatically increased PEDF expression in MSCs from old mice compared to young mice. Morphological and functional experiments demonstrated significantly impaired old MSC therapeutic efficacy compared with young MSCs in treatment of mice subjected to MI. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that administration of old MSCs compared with young MSCs resulted in an infarct region containing fewer endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, but more fibroblasts. Pigment epithelium-derived factor overexpression in young MSCs impaired the beneficial effects against MI injury, and induced cellular profile changes in the infarct region similar to administration of old MSCs. Knocking down PEDF expression in old MSCs improved MSC therapeutic efficacy, and induced a cellular profile similar to young MSCs administration. Studies in vitro showed that PEDF secreted by MSCs regulated the proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts.ConclusionsThis is the first evidence that paracrine factor PEDF plays critical role in the regulatory effects of MSCs against MI injury. Furthermore, the impaired therapeutic ability of aged MSCs is predominantly caused by increased PEDF secretion. These findings indicate PEDF as a promising novel genetic modification target for improving aged MSC therapeutic efficacy. © 2012 The Author.

84879510808	Cardiomyocyte-expressed farnesoid-X-receptor is a novel apoptosis mediator and contributes to myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury	AimsEmerging evidence indicates that nuclear receptors play a critical regulatory role in cardiovascular physiology/pathology. Recently, farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), a member of the metabolic nuclear receptor superfamily, has been demonstrated to be expressed in vascular cells, with important roles in vascular physiology/pathology. However, the potential cardiac function of FXR remains unclear. We investigated the cardiac expression and biological function of FXR.Methods and resultsFarnesoid-X-receptor was detected in both isolated neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. Natural and synthetic FXR agonists upregulated cardiac FXR expression, stimulated myocyte apoptosis, and reduced myocyte viability dose-and time-dependently. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that FXR agonists disrupted mitochondria, characterized by mitochondrial permeability transition pores activation, mitochondrial potential dissipation, cytochrome c release, and both caspase-9 and-3 activation. Such mitochondrial apoptotic responses were abolished by siRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous FXR or pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial death signalling. Furthermore, low levels of FXR were detected in the adult mouse heart, with significant (∼2.0-fold) upregulation after myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of FXR significantly reduced myocardial apoptosis by 29.0-53.4%, decreased infarct size by 23.4-49.7%, and improved cardiac function in ischaemic/reperfused myocardium.ConclusionThese results demonstrate that nuclear receptor FXR acts as a novel functional receptor in cardiac tissue, regulates apoptosis in cardiomyocytes, and contributes to MI/R injury. © 2013 Author(s).

84880209936	Hyperglycemia-Induced Protein Kinase C β	Protein kinase C (PKC)β2 is preferably overexpressed in the diabetic myocardium, which induces cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and contributes to diabetic cardiomyopathy, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Caveolae are critical in signal transduction of PKC isoforms in cardiomyocytes. Caveolin (Cav)-3, the cardiomyocyte-specific caveolar structural protein isoform, is decreased in the diabetic heart. The current study determined whether PKCβ2 activation affects caveolae and Cav-3 expression. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analysis revealed that high glucose (HG) increased the association and colocalization of PKCb2 and Cav-3 in isolated cardiomyocytes. Disruption of caveolae by methyl-β-cyclodextrin or Cav-3 small interfering (si)RNA transfection prevented HG-induced PKCb2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of PKCb2 activation by compound CGP53353 or knockdown of PKCβ2 expression via siRNA attenuated the reductions of Cav-3 expression and Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes exposed to HG. LY333531 treatment (for a duration of 4 weeks) prevented excessive PKCβ2 activation and attenuated cardiac diastolic dysfunction in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. LY333531 suppressed the decreased expression of myocardial NO, Cav-3, phosphorylated (p)-Akt, and p-eNOS and also mitigated the augmentation of O2 2, nitrotyrosine, Cav-1, and iNOS expression. In conclusion, hyperglycemia-induced PKCb2 activation requires caveolae and is associated with reduced Cav-3 expression in the diabetic heart. Prevention of excessive PKCb2 activation attenuated cardiac diastolic dysfunction by restoring Cav-3 expression and subsequently rescuing Akt/eNOS/NO signaling. © 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

84881578443	Ginsenoside Rd Attenuates Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury via Akt/GSK-3β Signaling and Inhibition of the Mitochondria-Dependent Apoptotic Pathway	Evidence suggests Ginsenoside Rd (GSRd), a biologically active extract from the medical plant Panax Ginseng, exerts antioxidant effect, decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Current study determined the effect of GSRd on myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury (a pathological condition where ROS production is significantly increased) and investigated the underlying mechanisms. The current study utilized an in vivo rat model of MI/R injury and an in vitro neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRC) model of simulated ischemia/reperfusion (SI/R) injury. Infarct size was measured by Evans blue/TTC double staining. NRC injury was determined by MTT and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay. ROS accumulation and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was determined by 5, 5′, 6, 6′-tetrachloro-1, 1′, 3, 3′-tetrathylbenzimidazol carbocyanine iodide (JC-1). Cytosolic translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c and expression of caspase-9, caspase-3, Bcl-2 family proteins, and phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3β were determined by western blot. Pretreatment with GSRd (50 mg/kg) significantly augmented rat cardiac function, as evidenced by increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and ±dP/dt. GSRd reduced myocardial infarct size, apoptotic cell death, and blood creatine kinase/lactate dehydrogenase levels after MI/R. In NRCs, GSRd (10 μM) inhibited SI/R-induced ROS generation (P<0.01), decreased cellular apoptosis, stabilized the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and attenuated cytosolic translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c. GSRd inhibited activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, increased the phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3β, and increased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Together, these data demonstrate GSRd mediated cardioprotective effect against MI/R-induced apoptosis via a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. © 2013 Wang et al.

84883230285	Autoantibody against angiotensin AT1 receptor from preeclamptic patients enhances collagen-induced human platelet aggregation	Hypercoagulability, platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia are the chief characteristics of preeclampsia, but their responsible underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Recent studies have demonstrated that the autoantibody against angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-AA) constitutes a novel risk factor for preeclampsia. However, the role of AT1-AA in platelet activation and hypercoagulability in preeclampsia has never been investigated. In the present study, we determined whether AT1-AA promotes platelet aggregation in vitro, and dissected the potential underlying mechanisms. AT1-AA was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After immunoglobulin G fractions purified from the preeclamptic patient positive sera were added to platelets isolated from healthy volunteers, platelet aggregation and intracellular Ca

84883658312	Creg promotes the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through the ERK/cyclin E signaling pathway	Cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG) is a recently discovered secreted glycoprotein involved in homeostatic modulation. We previously reported that CREG is abundantly expressed in the adult vascular endothelium and dramatically downregulated in atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, CREG participates in the regulation of apoptosis, inflammation and wound healing of vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we attempted to investigate the effect of CREG on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms. Overexpression of CREG in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) was obtained by infection with adenovirus carrying CREG. HUVEC proliferation was investigated by flow cytometry and 5-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assays. The expressions of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and signaling molecules were also examined. In CREG-overexpressing cells, we observed a marked increase in the proportion of the S and G2 population and a decrease in the G0/G1 phase population. The number of BrdU positively-stained cells also increased, obviously. Furthermore, silencing of CREG expression by specific short hairpin RNA effectively inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). CREG overexpression induced the expression of cyclin E in both protein and mRNA levels to regulate cell cycle progression. Further investigation using inhibitor blocking analysis identified that ERK activation mediated the CREG modulation of the proliferation and cyclin E expression in HUVEC. In addition, blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in CREG-overexpressed HUVEC and supplementation of VEGF in CREG knocked-down HUVEC identified that the pro-proliferative effect of CREG was partially mediated by VEGF-induced ERK/cyclin E activation. These results suggest a novel role of CREG to promote HUVEC proliferation through the ERK/cyclin E signaling pathway. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

84883824212	Sevoflurane preconditioning attenuates myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury via caveolin-3-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition	BACKGROUND - The inhaled anesthetic sevoflurane has been demonstrated to protect against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury via mechanisms involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and caveolin-3 (Cav-3). However, the relative contributions of AMPK and Cav-3 to sevoflurane preconditioning (SF-PreCon)-mediated cardioprotection and their precise underlying mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood. METHODS AND RESULTS - SF-PreCon (consisting of 3 cycles of 15-minute exposure to 2% sevoflurane before 30 minutes of MI) decreased MI/R injury in wild-type mice (caspase-3 activity, -29.1%; infarct size, -20.2%; and left ventricular end diastolic pressure, -33.8%). In cardiac-specific AMPKα2 dominant-negative overexpressing mice, the cardioprotective effect of SF-PreCon was largely retained (caspase-3 activity, -26.7%; infarct size, -16.7%; and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, -25.9%; P<0.01). In contrast, SF-PreCon failed to significantly protect Cav-3 knockout mice against MI/R injury (P>0.05). SF-PreCon significantly decreased MI/R-induced superoxide generation in wild-type (-43.6%) and AMPK dominant-negative overexpressing mice (-35.5%; P<0.01) but not in Cav-3 knockout mice. SF-PreCon did not affect nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase expression but significantly inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 expression in wild-type (-38.7%) and AMPK dominant-negative overexpressing mice (-35.8%) but not in Cav-3 knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS - We demonstrate for the first time SF-PreCon mediates cardioprotection against MI/R injury via caveolin-3-dependent cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition and antioxidative effects. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84883825935	C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-9, a novel adipocyte-derived cytokine, attenuates adverse remodeling in the ischemic mouse heart via protein kinase a activation	BACKGROUND - C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-9 (CTRP9) is a newly identified adiponectin paralog with established metabolic regulatory properties. However, the role of CTRP9 in postmyocardial infarction remodeling remains completely unknown. This study determined whether CTRP9 may regulate cardiac remodeling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS - Male adult mice were subject to AMI by left anterior descending coronary artery ligation or sham surgery and treated with saline (vehicle) or globular CTRP9 via peritoneal implant osmotic pumps for 6 weeks. H9C2 cardiac cell lines were used in vitro for determining underlying mechanisms. Adipocyte CTRP9 expression and plasma CTRP9 levels were both significantly reduced after AMI. Compared with vehicle, CTRP9 treatment improved animal survival rate (P<0.05), restored cardiac function (P<0.05), attenuated adverse remodeling (P<0.01), and ameliorated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and fibrosis after AMI (P<0.01). Among the multiple antiremodeling molecules determined, AMP-activated protein kinase, protein kinase A (PKA), and Akt were significantly activated in CTRP9-treated heart. Surprisingly, CTRP9 remains cardioprotective in mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a mutant AMP-activated protein kinase α2 subunit (AMPK-DN). Additional in vitro experiments demonstrated that administration of either PKA inhibitor or PKA-specific small interfering RNA virtually abolished the antiapoptotic effect of CTRP9 (P<0.05), whereas inhibition of Akt is less effective in blocking CTRP9 cardioprotection. Finally, CTRP9 phosphorylates BCL-2-associated agonist of cell death at its multiple antiapoptotic sites, an effect blocked by PKA inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS - We demonstrate that adipokine CTRP9 attenuates adverse cardiac remodeling after AMI, largely via a PKA-dependent pathway. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.

84885656829	Differential regulation of TNF receptor 1 and receptor 2 in adiponectin expression following myocardial ischemia	Background In vitro experiments demonstrate that adiponectin, a cardioprotective cytokine, is inhibited by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα). However, the role of TNFα in post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) adiponectin reduction remains unclear. More importantly, the TNF receptor type (TNFR1 or TNFR2) responsible for TNFα-mediated suppression of adiponectin production is unknown. The current study determined the role of TNFα in post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) adiponectin reduction, and identified the receptor type responsible for TNFα-mediated suppression of adiponectin production.

84886075814	Thioredoxin reductase was nitrated in the aging heart after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion	The age-related loss of anti-oxidant defense reduces recovery from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/R) in aged people. Our previous data showed that inactivation of thioredoxin (Trx) was involved in enhanced aging MI/R injury. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), the enzyme known to regulate Trx, is less efficient with age. The aim of the current study was to determine why TrxR activity was reduced and whether reduced TrxR activity contributed to enhanced aging MI/R injury. Both Trx and TrxR activity were decreased in the aging heart, and this difference was further amplified after MI/R. However, MI/R injury did not change TrxR expression between young and aging rats. Increased nitrogen oxide (NOx) but decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability (decreased phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) was observed in aging hearts. Peroxynitrite (ONOO

84890345049	Adiponectin inhibits oxidative/nitrative stress during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion via PKA signaling	The cardioprotective effects of adiponectin (APN) against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury are well known. However, comprehension of the mechanisms mediating intracellular APN signaling remains incomplete. We recently demonstrate the antioxidant/antinitrative effects of APN are not dependent on AMPK. Protein kinase A (PKA) has been previously shown to be activated by APN, with uncertain relevance to APN cardiac protection. The current study determined whether the antioxidative/antinitrative effect of APN is mediated by PKA. Administration of APN (2 μg/g) 10 min before reperfusion significantly enhanced cardiac PKA activity, reduced oxidative stress, and decreased infarct size. Knockdown of cardiac PKA expression (PKA-KD) by intramyocardial injection of PKA-siRNAs (>70% suppression) significantly inhibited APN cardioprotection determined by cardiac apoptosis, infarct size, and cardiac function. Moreover, PKA-KD virtually abolished the suppressive effect of APN on MI/Rinduced NADPH oxidase overexpression and superoxide overproduction and partially inhibited the effect of APN on nitrative protein modification in MI/R heart. Mechanistically, APN significantly inhibited MI/R-induced IKK/I

84894057277	IRF8 suppresses pathological cardiac remodelling by inhibiting calcineurin signalling	Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is known to affect the innate immune response, for example, by regulating the differentiation and function of immune cells. However, whether IRF8 can influence cardiac hypertrophy is unknown. Here we show that IRF8 levels are decreased in human dilated/hypertrophic cardiomyopathic hearts and in murine hypertrophic hearts. Mice overexpressing Irf8 specifically in the heart are resistant to aortic banding (AB)-induced cardiac hypertrophy, whereas mice lacking IRF8 either globally or specifically in cardiomyocytes develop an aggravated phenotype induced by pressure overload. Mechanistically, we show that IRF8 directly interacts with NFATc1 to prevent NFATc1 translocation and thus inhibits the hypertrophic response. Inhibition of NFATc1 ameliorates the cardiac abnormalities in IRF8 -/- mice after AB. In contrast, constitutive activation of NFATc1 nullifies the protective effects of IRF8 on cardiac hypertrophy in IRF8-overexpressing mice. Our results indicate that IRF8 is a potential therapeutic target in pathological cardiac hypertrophy. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84899759013	Cardiomyocyte apoptosis after nonlethal traumatic injury	Mechanical trauma constitutes a major medical and economic problem worldwide. Patients surviving initial blunt and penetrating trauma or crush injuries endure complications contributive to additional morbidity and potential mortality. It is well recognized that nonlethal mechanical trauma causes cardiomyocyte apoptosis exacerbating posttraumatic cardiac dysfunction. Early studies investigated how blood loss, necrosis-mediated potassium surge, and reactive oxygen species affected cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Recent clinical reports suggest blunt chest trauma induces myocardial infarction via tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mediated oxidative/nitrative stress, involving reactive nitrogen species, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nitrosylation. This review focuses upon mechanisms of cardiomyocyte apoptosis after nonlethal traumatic injury, and highlights TNF-α as a key mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis.

84904323024	Effective glycaemic control critically determines insulin cardioprotection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury in anaesthetized dogs	Aims Experimental evidence has shown significant cardioprotective effects of insulin, whereas clinical trials produced mixed results without valid explanations. This study was designed to examine the effect of hyperglycaemia on insulin cardioprotective action in a preclinical large animal model of myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (MI/R). Methods and results Anaesthetized dogswere subjected to MI/R (30 min/4 h) and randomized to normal plasma insulin/euglycaemia (NI/NG), normal-insulin/hyperglycaemia (NI/HG), high-insulin/euglycaemia (HI/NG), and high-insulin/hyperglycaemia (HI/HG) achieved by controlled glucose/insulin infusion. Endogenous insulin production was abolished by peripancreatic vessel ligation. Compared with the control animals (NI/NG), hyperglycaemia (NI/HG) significantly aggravated MI/R injury. Insulin elevation at clamped euglycaemia (HI/NG) protected against MI/R injury as evidenced by reduced infarct size, decreased necrosis and apoptosis, and alleviated inflammatory and oxidative stress (leucocyte infiltration, myeloperoxidase, and malondialdehyde levels). However, these cardioprotective effects of insulin were markedly blunted in hyperglycaemic animals (HI/HG). In vitro mechanistic study in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes revealed that insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Akt was significantly attenuated by high glucose, accompanied by markedly increased IRS-1 O-GlcNAc glycosylation following hypoxia/reoxygenation. Inhibition of hexosamine biosynthesis with 6-diazo-5-oxonorleucine abrogated high glucose-induced O-GlcNAc modification and inactivation of IRS-1/Akt as well as cell injury. Conclusions Our results, derived froma canine model of MI/R, demonstrate that hyperglycaemia blunts insulin protection against MI/R injury via hyperglycaemia-induced glycosylation and subsequent inactivation of insulin-signalling proteins. Our findings suggest that prevention of hyperglycaemia is critical for achieving maximal insulin cardioprotection for the ischaemic/ reperfused hearts. © The Author 2014.

84904508395	γδT cell-derived interleukin-17A via an interleukin-1β- dependent mechanism mediates cardiac Injury and Fibrosis in hypertension	Inflammation is implicated in the initiation of hypertension and end-organ injury. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a key pathogenic factor in a variety of inflammatory diseases and hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying IL-17A production, and its role in mediating inflammation and early cardiovascular injury in hypertensive heart, remain unknown. Angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion increased cardiac IL-17A mRNA expression and IL-17ACD3 cell infiltration in a time-dependent manner. IL-17A in the hypertensive heart was derived mostly from infiltrating γδT cells rather than from CD4 T cells. Genetic knockdown of γδT cells or specific anti-γδT antibody abolished IL-17A production in Ang II-infused heart. Moreover, monocyte-secreted IL-1β, not cardiac fibroblast-secreted IL-6 or transforming growth factor-β, was required for IL-17A production from γδT cell. IL-17A accelerated differentiation of myofibroblast through promoting IL-6 production from cardiac fibroblast. Finally, inflammatory cell infiltration, proinflammatory or profibrotic cytokine expression, and fibrotic lesion induced by Ang II were attenuated in IL-17A-deficient mice. Moreover, the deletion of γδT cell was protected from Ang II-induced cardiac injury. Thus, a triangular positive feedback loop exists among monocytic-secreted IL-1β, γδT-cell-derived IL-17A, and cardiac fibroblast-produced IL-6, which triggers the cardiac injury in hypertension. © 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.

84923855325	Activation of liver-X-receptor α but not liver-X-receptor β protects against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury	Background-Liver-X-receptors, LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2), encode 2 different but highly homologous isoforms of transcription factors belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Whether LXRα and LXRβ subtypes have discrete roles in the regulation of cardiac physiology/pathology is unknown. We determine the role of each LXR subtype in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) injury. Methods and Results-Mice (wild type; those genetically depleted of LXRα, LXRβ, or both; and those overexpressing LXRα or LXRβ by in vivo intramyocardial adenoviral vector) were subjected to MI/R injury. Both LXRα and LXRβ were detected in wild-type mouse heart. LXRα, but not LXRβ, was significantly upregulated after MI/R. Dual activation of LXRα and LXRβ by natural and synthetic agonists reduced myocardial infarction and improved contractile function after MI/R. Mechanistically, LXR activation inhibited MI/R-induced oxidative stress and nitrative stress, attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in ischemic/ reperfused myocardium. The aforementioned cardioprotective effects of LXR agonists were impaired in the setting of cardiac-specific gene silencing of LXRα, but not LXRβ subtype. Moreover, LXRα/β double-knockout and LXRα- knockout mice, but not LXRβ-knockout mice, increased MI/R injury, exacerbated MI/R-induced oxidative/nitrative stress, and aggravated endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, cardiac LXRα, not LXRβ, overexpression via adenoviral transfection suppressed MI/R injury. Conclusions-Our study provides the first direct evidence that the LXRα, but not LXRβ, subtype is a novel endogenous cardiac protective receptor against MI/R injury. Drug development strategies specifically targeting LXRα may be beneficial in treating ischemic heart disease.
