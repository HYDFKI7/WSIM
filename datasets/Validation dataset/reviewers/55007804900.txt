84934889899	Transcutaneous neuromodulation at posterior tibial nerve and ST36 for chronic constipation	The aims of this study were to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of transcutaneous neuromodulation (TN) in patients with chronic constipation. Twelve patients were recruited. The treatment consisted of 2-week TN and 2-week sham-TN which was performed in a crossover design. Bowel habit diary, Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptom (PAC-SYM), Patient Assessment of ConstipationQuality of Life (PAC-QOL), and anorectalmotilitywere evaluated. Electrocardiogram was recorded for the assessment of autonomic function during acute TN therapy. It was found that (1) TN improved the frequency of spontaneous defecation. After 2-week TN therapy, 83% patients had more than 3 times bowel movements per week which was significantly different from sham-TN (P = 0.01). (2) TN improved PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scores (P < 0.001, resp.). (3) TN significantly decreased the threshold volume to elicit RAIR (P < 0.05), ameliorated rectal sensory threshold (P = 0.04), and maximumtolerance (P = 0.04). (4) TN, but not sham-TN, increased the vagal activity (P = 0.01 versus baseline) and decreased the sympathetic activity (P = 0.01, versus baseline). It was concluded that needleless TN at posterior tibial nerve and ST36 using a watch-size stimulator is effective in chronic constipation, and the effect was possibly mediated via the autonomic mechanism.

84946165235	Rationale for clinical use of wireless motility capsule	The wireless motility capsule (WMC) is a recently developed technique for evaluating gastrointestinal motility. As the capsule moves through the gastrointestinal tract, it allows for real-time measurement of the pH, temperature and pressure of its surrounding environment to indirectly calculate gastric emptying time (GET), small bowel transit time (SBTT), colonic transit time (CTT) and whole gut transit time (WGTT). The WMC is especially suitable for patients suspected of dysmotility in more than one region in the gastrointestinal tract. The US FDA has approved the WMC for the evaluation of gastric emptying time in patients with suspected gastroparesis and colonic transit time in patients with suspected chronic constipation, and for the characterization of antral and duodenal pressure profiles. In addition, the WMC has been tested as an alternative to scintigraphy and radiopaque marker technology in several clinical trails. This review summarizes the rationale for clinical use of the WMC. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

9644272709	Alterations of Cajal cell in colon of slow transit constipation mice	AIM: To establish an animal model of slow transit constipation and to investigate the relationship between interstitial cell of Cajal in colon and the pathophysiological changes in the model of slow transit constipation. METHODS: The mouse model was established by subcutaneous injection of morphine. According to period of morphine injected, the mice were divided into two groups: 2.5 mg/kg/per day × 30 d (n = 15) and 2.5 mg/kg/per day × 45 d (n = 15), and corresponding control groups were established by injecting the same dosage of 9 g/L sodium chloride solution. Fecal weight was recorded daily, and transit function of intestine was measured by activated charcoal suspension pushing test. The changes of interstitial cell of Cajal were observed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Fecal weight daily in test group I was less than control group I (18.8±3.2 g vs 20.6±1.8 g, P <0.05), and test group II was less than control group II (16.8±2.0 g vs 22.0±3.2 g, P <0.01). It showed the significance of difference between the test group I vs test group II (P <0.05), and no difference between two control groups (P >0.05). Intestinal transit rate in test group I was lower than control group I (45.3±1.5% vs 49.2±1.8%, P <0.05), and test group II was lower than control group II (40.6±1.3% vs 50.6±3.0%, P <0.01). There was a significant difference between test group I vs test group II (P <0.05), and no difference between two control groups (P >0.05). Colon tissue c-kit

14744293186	Expression pattern of TG-interacting factor 2 during mouse development	TGIF2 is a close homologue of TGIF that functions as a transcriptional corepressor by interaction with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-activated Smads. Mutations of TGIF have been found in holoprosencephaly, a genetic disease affecting forebrain and craniofacial developmental. Here we analyzed the expression pattern of TGIF2 during mouse embryogenesis. Expression of TGIF2 transcripts was detected at high level at E12.5 and E15.5 in the nervous system including neopallial cortex, mesencephalon, metencephalon, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, trigeminal ganglion, vestibulocochlear ganglion and dorsal root ganglion. In addition, TGIF2 transcripts could be detected in other tissues including heart, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, small intestine and nasal cavity. These data indicated that TGIF2 has a wide but well controlled expression pattern during mouse development. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

14844362769	Induction of a cell stress response gene RTP801 by DNA damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate through CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein	RTP801 is a newly discovered stress response gene that is induced by hypoxia and other cell stress signals. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which a DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), induces RTP801 transcription. In HaCaT human keratinocytes, MMS was able to induce a rapid increase in the mRNA level of RTP801. Correspondingly, MMS treatment was capable of stimulating a 2.5 kb RTP801 promoter. Deletion studies with the promoter demonstrated a critical region between -1057 and -981 bp of the promoter that is responsive to MMS treatment. Point mutations of the consensus Elk-1 and C/EBP sites within this region were able to abrogate the stimulatory effect of MMS, indicating that Elk-1 and C/EBP are both involved in the transcriptional regulation of the RTP801 gene by MMS. Furthermore, a gel mobility shift assay revealed that MMS was able to initiate rapid formation of a protein complex that bound the C/EBP site of the promoter. In addition, an anti-C/EBPβ antibody was capable of further shifting the bound protein complex. Therefore, these studies indicate that RTP801 is a transcriptional target of MMS in human keratinocytes and that C/EBP is implicated in transcriptional control of the gene. © 2005 American Chemical Society.

18444397739	Topical application of penciclovir cream for the treatment of herpes simplex facialis/labialis: A randomized, double-blind, multicentre, aciclovir-controlled trial	BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex facialis/labialis (HSFL) is a common infectious skin disorder, caused mainly by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1, for which the topical application of a cream containing an antiviral agent for treatment of the disease has been widely utilized. OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of the topical application of 1% penciclovir cream in the treatment of HSFL, and to compare its efficacy and safety with 3% aciclovir cream. METHODS: A total of 248 patients with a diagnosis of HSFL were randomly allocated to one of the two treatment groups (n = 124 each), using stratified randomization based on a table of random numbers. Before treatment (day 0) and at every visit (days 3, 5 and 7) during the study, the sign and symptom scores were recorded by the same doctor. RESULTS: Excluding 23 patients (10 in the penciclovir and 13 in the aciclovir groups), 225 completed the study, and no severe adverse events were noted with any of the treatment regimens. Results show that an encouraging improvement in the clinical course was found simultaneously for patients with each episode type and each treatment assignment. There were no significant differences in terms of efficacy endpoint, clinical cure rate, and safety between the two treatment arms, but there was a trend towards a shorter time to resolution of all symptoms, cessation of new blisters, and loss of crust (p ≤ 0.08) in penciclovir-treated primary patients. In addition, the clinical scores in penciclovir-treated primary patients were significantly lower than those in the respective aciclovir-treated patients on treatment day 5 (p < 0.01) and day 7 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Topical 1% penciclovir cream is as convenient and as effective as 3% aciclovir cream for the treatment of HSFL. Penciclovir cream may provide a good topical alternative to other types of therapy in the future.

20444385843	Expression profiles of adiponectin receptors in mouse embryos	Adiponectin is a protein secreted from adipocytes and it plays an important endocrine role in glucose and lipid homeostasis. A reverse correlation between plasma adiponectin concentrations and insulin resistance has been established in both animals and humans. Adiponectin exerts its function by interacting with membrane receptors, including AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. We investigated the expression pattern of these two adiponectin receptors in mouse embryos. At stages E12.5 and E15.5, both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 are highly expressed in the nervous system including the trigeminal ganglion, glossopharyngeal ganglion and dorsal root ganglia. AdipoR1 is highly expressed in many tissues derived from primitive gut, including the lung, liver, pancreas and small intestines. Generally, the expression level of AdipoR2 is weaker and more restricted than AdipoR1 in most of the tissues. In addition, AdipoR1 expression can be found in heart, vertebrate, developing bones and cartilage, and many other tissues. This study reveals that AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 have differential but overlapping expression profiles during mouse development. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

1942425007	Clinical significance of functional constipation categorization through detection of colonic transit time and pelvic floor electromyography	Background: Functional constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder. With the changes of social life style and dietary composition, its incidence increases year by year, and the age of patients are much younger than before. Correct categorization would be useful in guiding the treatment of functional constipation. Aims: To appraise the clinical significance of colonic transit time examination and pelvic floor electromyography in correct categorization of functional constipation. Methods: Thirty-two cases of functional constipation concordant with Rome II diagnostic criteria with a course of history from 6 months to 30 years were enrolled. Radio-opaque markers were used for detection of colonic transit time, the transit index (TI) and colonic evacuation rate were calculated; Pelvic floor electromyography was used in combination to observe whether there existed any paradoxical movement between pelvic floor muscle and belly muscles. Results: Colonic transit time shown in 20 patients was of outlet obstruction constipation, 12 patients were of slow transit type. In the outlet obstruction type, the pelvic floor electromyography showed varying degrees of paradoxical movement between pelvic floor muscle and belly muscles, whereas in the slow transit type, only 4 cases showed paradoxical movement between pelvic floor muscle and belly muscles. Conclusions: Colonic transit time examination and pelvic floor electromyography can provide correct categorization of functional constipation, which are simple and feasible without induction of pain.

2442619437	Effects of erythromycin on colon dysmotility and neuroendocrine peptides in diabetic mellitus	AIM: To investigate the effects of erythromycin on contractive activity of isolated proximal colon smooth muscle and the change of somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, motilin and substance P in diabetic mellitus rats. METHODS: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: the control (n=10), the diabetic (n=10) and erythromycin (n=10). The resting tension, the mean contractile amplitude and frequency of spontaneous changes of isolated longitudinal, circular proximal colon smooth muscle strips were measured by transducer, and somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, motilin, substance P levels in plasma and proximal colon tissue extracts were measured by radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: In isolated proximal colon smooth muscle strips, the motility parameters were significantly lower in diabetic rats than those in control (P ≤0.01). After taking erythromycin, the colon motility parameters were significantly strengthened compared with those in diabetic rats (P ≤0.01). In diabetic rats, the plasma levels of somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and motilin were higher than those in control (P ≤0.05), while substance P level was decreased (P ≤0.05). In the proximal colon, the levels of somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal peptide were significantly lower than that in control (P ≤0.01, P ≤0.05), the level of substance P was higher than that in the control (P ≤0.05), and the level of motilin did not differ from that in the control (P >0.05). After taking erythromycin, the plasma level of somatostatin was higher than that in diabetic rats (P ≤0.05). The serum glucose was decreased in diabetic rats after erythromycin treatment (P ≤0.01). CONCLUSION: Erythromycin has direct effect on colon smooth muscle, and has little effect on neuroendocrine peptides. Colonic motility disorders in diabetes rats are related with the changes of neuroendocrine peptides' levels in plasma and colon tissue.

26944469064	Effect of erythromycin on gastric dysmotility and neuroendocrine peptides in rats with diabetes mellitus	Objective: To investigate the effect of erythromycin on the contractive activity of the isolated gastric antrum smooth muscle and somatostatin (SS), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), motilin (MTL), and substance P (SP) in plasma and isolated gastric antrum tissue of diabetes mellitus (DM) rat models. Methods: Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: control group (n = 10), DM group (n = 10), and erythromycin group (DM models with erythromycin treatment, n = 10). A single dose of streptozotocin (100 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.1 mol/L citric acid buffer, pH4.5) was injected intraperitoneally. After 48 to 72 hours, rats with blood glucose above 16.7 mmol/L and urine glucose level to be (+++) to (++++) over one week were considered successful DM models. The resting tension, mean contractile amplitude and frequency of spontaneous change in isolated longitudinal and circular gastric antrum smooth muscle strips were measured. SS, VIP, MTL, and SP levels in plasma and gastric antrum tissue were measured using radioimmunoassay. Results: (1) In the isolated gastric antrum smooth muscle strips, the gastric motility parameters were lower in DM group than those in control group except circular smooth muscle contractile amplitude and longitudinal smooth muscle contractile frequency. The gastric motility parameters were significantly strengthened in erythromycin group, compared with DM group except longitudinal smooth muscle resting tension (P < 0.01). (2) Plasma SS, VIP, and MTL concentrations in DM group were higher than those in control (P < 0.05), while the SP level decreased (P < 0.05). In the gastric antrum, SS of DM group was significantly higher than that of control group (P < 0.01), while SP and MTL levels were lower than those of control group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). However, the level of VIP in gastric antrum tissue did not change among three groups. The plasma level of SS in erythromycin group was higher than that of DM group (P < 0.05). (3) The blood glucose was lower in erythromycin group than DM group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Erythromycin has direct effects on contractive activity of gastric smooth muscle in diabetic rats, but there are few effects on neuroendocrine peptides. Gastric-mod lity disorders in diabetic rats have a correlation with the changes of neuroendocrine peptide levels in plasma and gastric antrum tissue.

27644556440	Social, psychosocial and behavior characteristics of patients with functional constipation and the follow-up of the effects of biofeedback therapy	Aim: To evaluate the psychosocial characteristics, life events, and the outcome of biofeedback in patients with functional constipation, and investigate the correlative factors of functional constipation, and the effects of constipation on quality of life and the confidence of the patients. Methods: 1 Forty-four(male 16 and female 28) patients with functional constipation were selected as the functional constipation group, who were treated in the Center for Gastrointestinal Motility of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University during January 1998 and December 2001. Thirty-one (male 12 and female 19) healthy volunteers from the Gupinggang community were taken as the controls between December 200 and April 2001. All the subjects were attend our investigation voluntarily. 2 The patients were treated with Orion PC/4 EMG Biofeedback Training System for 3 times, 50 to 60 minutes once for a total 10 to 15 courses at our Gastrointestinal Motility Center, and they were also trained at home. The time for training and times of training was different in different people. 3 Symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90, the test is scored for 90 symptoms, including nine clinical subscales as follows: somatization of affection, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD, used to assess the anxiety and depress status of the outpatients and inpatients, including fourteen items, scored from 1 to 4), and the Life Event Scale were completed by these 44 patients and 31 healthy subjects to access their psychosocial characteristics. All tests were scored before the treatment.4 All patients were also asked to make a global assessment. Before treatment, assessment included the history, the bowel habit, diet and the influence on the life. After treatment and at one year after follow-up, the investigation included the treatment effect by stating whether their bowel problems were worse, unaltered, or better than before treatment. The follow-up investigation was finished by phone, letter or call-at. 5 The inter-group measurement data were done using single-factor analysis of variance and t test, and enumeration data were detected by χ

28044463802	Arsenite induces a cell stress-response gene, RTP801, through reactive oxygen species and transcription factors Elk-1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein	RTP801 is a newly discovered stress-response gene that is induced by hypoxia and other cell stress signals. Arsenic is a heavy metal that is linked to carcinogenesis in humans. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which arsenic induces RTP801 transcription. In HaCaT human keratinocytes, arsenite was able to induce a rapid rise in the RTP801 mRNA level. Correspondingly, arsenite treatment was capable of stimulating a 2.5 kb human RTP801 promoter. Such a stimulatory effect was inhibited by co-expression of superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase, and was abrogated by N-acetylcysteine, implying that ROS (reactive oxygen species) were involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTP801 gene. A series of deletion studies with the promoter revealed a critical arsenic-responsive region between - 1057 and - 981 bp of the promoter. Point mutations of the putative Elk-1 site and the C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) site within this region were able to reduce the stimulatory effect of arsenite, indicating that Elk-1 and C/EBP are involved in transcriptional regulation of the RTP801 gene by arsenite. Furthermore, a gel mobility-shift assay demonstrated that arsenite was able to mount the rapid formation of a protein complex that bound the arsenic-responsive region as well as the C/EBP-containing sequence. The arsenite stimulation on RTP801 transcription was partly mediated by the ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway, since the effect of RTP801 was inhibited by a selective ERK inhibitor. In addition, overexpression of Elk-1 and C/EBPß was able to elevate the promoter activity. Therefore these studies indicate that RTP801 is a transcriptional target of arsenic in human keratinocytes, and that arsenic and ROS production are linked to Elk-1 and C/EBP in the transcriptional control. © 2005 Biochemical Society.

32344448981	Study on the expression of RXRα in patients with psoriasis vulgaris	Retinoic acid regulates keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation - processes that are disturbed in psoriatic skin - via binding to nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptor (RAR-α,β,γ) and the common heterodimer partners (RXR-α,β,γ). By RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry methods, the expression of RXRα was studied in psoriatic skin and controls. The expression of RXRα was down-regulated in patients with psoriasis; moreover, its level was related to the stage of the disease; in the progressive stage of the disease, the level of the RXRα was lower than in the stable stage. The results suggest that retinoid signaling is abnormal in lesional psoriatic skin, RXRα expression is mainly confined to differentiated keratinocytes.

31544441913	Effect of epidermal growth factor receptor in the repair of colonic mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis	Aim: To study expression of growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colonic mucosa in patients with active or inactive ulcerative colitis so as to explore the clinical signification of EGFR. Methods: Thirty-two patients hospitalized for ulcerative colitis in the Department of Digestion, the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between May 2001 and May 2005 were enrolled, and divided into two groups of active ulcerative colitis (n=22) and inactive ulcerative colitis (n =10) according to the value of modified Williams Disease Activated Index(DAI). Meanwhile, 10 health examinees in the outpatient or patients hospitalized for irritable bowel syndrome were selected as controls. All the participants agreed to receive colonoscopy and biopsy of mucous membrane. SP immunohistochemical method was used to examine expression of EGFR and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in colon mucosal specimens from the area of the severest inflammation of active and inactive ulcerative colitis groups or from control group. Positive EGFR was found in cytoplasm and cell membrane, and positive PCNA was found in nuclei. Positive produce was a brown granule. Number of positive epithelial cells was calculated on five high-fold visual field chosen from each section. Evaluation criteria: 1 Radio of the number of positive EGFR to the total number of epithelial cells < 5% as 0, < 50% as 1, > 50% as 2; according to staining condition, unstained as 0, yellow as 1 and brown as 2; The summation of the above two ones equal to 0 as negative (-), 1 as weakly positive(1+), 2-3 as positive(2+), and 4 as strongly positive(3+). 2Radio of the number of positive PCNA to total number of epithelial cells < 25% as I, 26% to 50% as II, 51% to 75% as III, > 76% as IV, and III and IV presented over-expression of PCNA. Results: All the participants without loss were involved in the result analysis. In the control group, the frequency of EGFR positive expression was 4/10, proliferative activity was the lowest and grade I PCNA expression was found in 7 subjects. In the active ulcerative colitis group, the frequencies of EGFR positive expression and PCNA overexpression were 19/22 and 5/22, respectively, and proliferative activity was strengthened. In the inactive ulcerative colitis, the frequencies of EGFR positive expression and PCNA overexpression were 10/10 and 9/10, respectively. The rates of EGFR positive expression and PCNA overexpression significant increase in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (100%, 90%, respectively) as compared with active ulcerative colitis (86%, 23%, respectively) or control group(25%, 10%, respectively)(P < 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with inactive ulcerative colitis, EGFR positive expression significantly increased as well as cell proliferation, which indicated that EGFR is involved in the repair of colonic inflammatory mucosa in ulcerative colitis. Adequate expression of EGFR plays a key role in the injury repair, and overexpression of EGFR may be involved in the malignant changes leading to the rectal cancer associated with ulcerative colitis.

31544467059	Alterations of Cajal interstitial cell and nitrogen monoxide in colons of mice with slow-transit motility induced by morphine	Aim: To investigate the effects of interstitial c s of Cajal of pacemaker cells of gastrointestinal tract, which produce slow wave and conduct electrical excitation and inhibitive neurotransmitter nitrogen monoxide in slow-transit constipation motility by the observation on animal models with slow-transit constipation. Methods: The experiment was conducted at the experimental animal center of Nanjing Medical University between January and February 2004. Twenty clean grade ICR male and female (half and halt) mice were selected with the body mass of 22-25 g. They were assigned randomly into experimental group and control group with 10 mice in each group. The mice in the experimental group were given with morphine hydrochloride (10 mg/mL)2.5 mg/kg with subcutaneous injection, and those in the control group were given saline with the sam volume, for 45 days. Quality of feces of the mice in the two groups was recorded and the trait of the feces was observed, respectively. Forty-five days later, the mice in the experimental group and the control group were fasting for 24 hours, respectively to perform activated carbon suspension pushing test. Percentage of distance of ink driving in length of the whole intestines was calculated (Driving rate of intestines= distance of ink driving/ length of the whole intestines×100%). One proximal and distal tissues of colon were gained from every mouse, respectively, and the tissues were fixed, embed and sliced up. The interstitial cell of Cajal and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) were observed by immunohistochemistry. The brown cytoplasm staining was considered as positive cells. Transmittable function of intestines of mice in the experimental group and control group was compared with mean mass of feces every day and activated carbon suspension pushing test. Changes of interstitial cell of Cajal and positive area of NOS in the tissue of colon of mice in the two groups were analyzed with computer imaging analysis system. Results: All the experimental animals were involved in the result analysis. 1 There was no significant difference on mean quality of feces of mice of the two groups, but the feces of the mice in the experimental group was dry and hard as compared with the control group (Bristol grade 1-2 grades,4-5 grades). 2 The driving rate of intestines of mice in the experimental gToup was lower significantly than that in the control group [(49.7±13.6)%, (66.9±13.1)%,t=2.88,P < 0.05]. 3 There was expression of neural NOS in the tissues of colon of mice in the experimental group and control group, but no expression of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS.

Methods: This experiment was carried out in the animal center of Nanjing Medical University and in the experimental room of the department of digestion of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from March to August 2005. Thirty SD rats were selected and randomly divided into the normal control group (n=10) and the diabetic model group (n=20). Rats in the diabetic model group were made into diabetic models with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (80 mg/kg) for only one time, and those in normal control group were intraperitoneally injected with the equal citric acid buffer. After 72 hours, the level of blood glucose was detected in venous blood of tails. The rats with fasting blood glucose (FBG) equal to or more than 16.7 mmol/L served as diabetic rats. After raising rats of two groups for 6 weeks, the rats in the two groups were killed. The driving rate of colon was calculated under no tension. The expression of substance P in the colon tissue of rats was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of substance P mRNA in the colon tissue of rats was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Results: Twenty rats were involved in the result analysis, and 10 in each group. 1 The expression of substance P was found in the colon tissue of rats in the normal control group and diabetic model group, and the immunoreactive positive products of substance P were mainly distributed in the myenteric plexus and submucosal plexus. 2 Driving rate of colon: It was lower in the diabetic model group than that in the normal control group (0.784 9±0.072 2,0.861 9±0.048 1,P < 0.001). 3 Area of positive cells, of substance P in colon tissue: It was smaller in the myenteric plexus of proximal and distal colon in the diabetic model group than that in the normal control group [(3.25 ±0.36)×10

33745757477	Iressa in the treatment of 24 cases of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had failed to previous chemotherapy	Background and objective: Iressa is the inhibitor of epidemic growth factor receptor and mainly used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and toxicity of Iressa in the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who had failed to previous chemotherapy. Methods: Twenty-four patients with advanced NSCLC who were previously treated with chemotherapy received 250 mg of Iressa orally once daily until disease progressing or intolerable toxicity developing. Tumor evaluation was performed before treatment. Then for every four weeks after administration they recevied the examination; after administration for sixteen weeks, examination was repeated once every eight weeks. Results: All twenty-four patients could be evaluated. One case got complete response, eight cases got partial response, three had no change and twelve had disease progression. So the response rate was 37.5%, the stable disease rate was 12.5%, and the clinical benifit rate was 50.0%. Median time to disease progressing was 87 days. All patients were followed up for two years and 1- and 2-year survival rate was 33.3% and 12.5% respectively. The common adverse effects were skin reaction and diarrhea and no grade III or IV toxicity was observed. Two cases were suspected of pulmonary interstitial changes and the treatment ended. Conclusion: Iressa is effective in treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who had failed to previous chemotherapy and the adverse effects are tolerable.

33748462897	Skin colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in patients with eczema and atopic dermatitis and relevant combined topical therapy: A double-blind multicentre randomized controlled trial	Background: Staphylococcus aureus has a peculiar ability to colonize the skin of patients with eczema and atopic dermatitis (AD), and is consistently found in eczematous skin lesions in these patients. A correlation between the severity of the eczema and colonization with S. aureus has been demonstrated, and it has been determined that bacterial colonization is an important factor aggravating skin lesions. Patients colonized with S. aureus have been treated with antibiotics in several open and double-blind placebo-controlled studies, with conflicting results. Objectives: To investigate the colonizing features of S. aureus in the lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with eczema and AD in China and to compare the therapeutic effect of mupirocin plus hydrocortisone butyrate with vehicle ointment plus hydrocortisone butyrate. Methods: A multicentre, double-blind randomized trial was conducted. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) scores were evaluated before the start of the trial and on the 7th, 14th and 28th day of treatment. Swabs for bacterial isolation were taken from lesional skin before the start of the trial and on the 7th, 14th and 28th day of treatment, and from nonlesional skin only before the start of the trial. A combination topical therapy with mupirocin plus hydrocortisone butyrate ointment was used in the experimental group, with vehicle ointment plus hydrocortisone butyrate ointment as a control. Results: Of 327 patients enrolled in the study, 208 had eczema and 119 had AD. Bacteria were isolated from 70.2% of lesional and 32.7% of nonlesional skin samples from patients with eczema, of which S. aureus accounted for 47.3% and 27.9%, respectively. Bacteria were isolated from 74.8% of lesional and 34.5% of nonlesional skin samples from patients with AD, of which S. aureus accounted for 79.8% and 80.5%, respectively. The colonization density of S. aureus was markedly higher in lesional than in nonlesional skin, both in patients with eczema and with AD (P < 0.01, P < 0.05), and was positively correlated with lesion severity. Considering the EASI scores before and after treatment and the final effective rate, good therapeutic effects were obtained in both the combination experimental groups and the control groups (P < 0.01), and there were no differences in the global therapeutic effect between the two groups in patients with eczema and with AD (P > 0.05). However, in patients with eczema with a clinical score of > 8 or in patients with AD with a clinical score of > 7, the therapeutic effect in the experimental groups was superior to that in the control groups (P < 0.05) on the 7th day of treatment. There were no differences between the two groups on the 14th and 28th days of treatment (P > 0.05). Following the improvement of symptoms and signs of eczema and AD, the positive rates of bacteria and S. aureus were reduced on the 7th day of treatment. Conclusions: This study confirmed that lesional skin of patients with eczema and AD was more frequently colonized with S. aureus than was nonlesional skin. The more severe the eczema, the higher the colonization rate of S. aureus, and S. aureus was also more often present in lesional and nonlesional skin in patients with AD than in those with eczema. Staphylococcus aureus infection is related to the pathogenesis of eczema and AD. An antibiotic-corticosteroid combination and corticosteroid alone both gave good therapeutic effect in eczema and in AD, and both reduced colonization by S. aureus. Early combined topical therapy is beneficial to patients with moderate to severe eczema and AD, and it is unnecessary to use antibiotics at later stages of disease or in mild eczema or AD. © 2006 British Association of Dermatologists.

33846034946	Effect of nitricoxide synthase on chronic alcohol drinking-induced adaptive cytoprotection of rat gastric mucosa and its relationship with volume fraction of ethanol	Aim: To investigate the effect of ethanol in different volume fractions (VFs) on the activity of nitricoxide synthase (NOS) in the rats with chronic alcohol drinking and its role in adaptive cytoprotection in rat gastric mucoso. Methods: The experiment was carried out in the Department of Physiology, Nanjing Medical University between September 2004 and December 2005. Sixty healthy male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups with ten rats in each group: In control group, rats drunk tap water, while in other five groups, rats received the drinking containing 0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.12 or 0.24 VF of ethanol respectively. After three days of drinking, seven rats were selected from each group to be perfused with 2 mL pure ethanol of 1 VF into the stomachs. All rats were decapitated at 2 hours after perfusion, containing the other three rats, and the severity of mucosal lesions were measured (The higher scores indicated the severer injury). The expressions of three NOSs, including neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) as well as their mRNA in gastric mucosa were measured by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerise chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Results: Totally 60 rats entered the result analysis. 1 Index of gastric mucosal injury: Compared with control group, the gastric lesions in rats were reduced after their exposure to the ethanol in 0.06 and 0.12 VF (22 ±9, 24±9, 112±26, P < 0.05). And there was no significant difference between control rats and rats which were exposed to the ethanol in VF of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.24 (P > 0.05). 2 Immunohistochemical staining. Three kinds of NOS were positively expressed in control and drinking groups. 3 NOS mRNA expression: eNOS mRNA was expressed irregularly in all groups. nNOS mRNA was expressed equally in the control, 0.01, 0.03 and 0.24 VF of ethanol groups, while not expressed in 0.06 and 0.12 VF ethanol groups. iNOS mRNA was only expressed in ethanol groups of 0.12 and 0.24 VF. Conclusion: The decreased expression of nNOS may induce the adaptive cytoprotection in the gastric mucosa of rats with chronic alcohol drinking, and is associated with the VF of ethanol.

33846453287	Effect of interference in heme oxygenase on colonic dysfunction of diabetic rats	AIM: To investigate the effect of heme oxygenase (HO) interference on the colonic dysfunction in rats with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: DM model was established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) in Sprague and Dawley rats. Six weeks later, the diabetic rats were validated to be suffered with gastrointestinal dysfunction using charcoal (Indian ink) propulsion experiment. Then the rest rats were randomly divided into 4 groups, named group A (normal control), B (diabetic rats without interference), C (diabetic rats administrated with Hemin, the inducer of HO) and D [diabetic rats administrated with zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP IX), the inhibitor of HO]. The weight and blood glucose of the rats were tested. Three more weeks later, the motilities of the strips isolated from the proximal and distal colon were recorded. The level of HO in the colon was also detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. RESULTS: The model of diabetic rats suffered with gastrointestinal dysfunction was successfully duplicated. Administration of Hemin or ZnPP IX had no effect on the weight or blood glucose of diabetic rats (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in HO-2 expression of the distal colon between the diabetic rats with or/and without interference (P > 0.05). But in comparison with the controls, HO-2 expression of the proximal colon in group B, C or D was significantly declined (Western blot: 1.20 ± 0.09, 1.08 ± 0.11, 1.10 ± 0.08 vs 1.66 ± 0.14, P < 0.05). The colonic expression of HO-1 was not significantly different between group A and B (Western blot: proximal 0.22 ± 0.02 vs 0.22 ± 0.03; distal 0.23 ± 0.03 vs 0.23 ± 0.03; both P > 0.05), but HO-1 expression was markedly higher in group C (proximal 0.66 ± 0.09; distal 0.47 ± 0.07) than that in the former two groups (P < 0.05); the expression of HO-1 was hardly found in group D. In comparison with those in group B, the gastrointestinal propulsion rate (54.4% ± 2.9% vs 63.0% ± 1.2%, P < 0.05), spontaneous contraction frequencies, amplitudes, and reaction to acetylcholine of colonic smooth muscles were dramatically declined in group C (P < 0.05), while those (gastrointestinal propulsion rate: 72.5% ± 2.6% vs 63.0% ± 1.2%, P < 0.05) in group D were markedly improved (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: HO interference has no effect on the body weight or blood glucose of diabetic rats. The induction of HO-1 may aggravate the decline of colonic motility in diabetic rats, while HO-1 blockage may improve the declined colonic motility.

33846167405	Alteration of Cajal cells in colonic tissue of slow-transit motility model in mouse	Background: The pathogenesis of slow transit constipation is unknown in most cases. The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) have been increasingly recognized as the cells acting as gastrointestinal pacemaker and neurotransmitter mediator. Furthermore, the abnormal changes of the number and structure of ICC have been described in a variety of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Aims: To appraise the changes of ICCs in colonic tissue of slow-transit colonic motility mouse model. Methods: The mouse model was constructed by subcutaneous injection of morphine. Proximal and distal colonic tissues were obtained and the expression and distribution of ICCs were observed by immunohistochemistry. c-Kit protein and c-kit mRNA were detected by Western blot and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Results: 1 In the proximal colonic tissues, the surface area of e-kit positive cells in the test groups decreased significantly compared with that in the control group (P<0.01), and that in the test group 11 was less than that in the test group I after 45 days (P<0.01). The surface area of e-kit positive cells in the group after stopping of morphine was less than that in the groups given naloxone and in the control group after 60 days (P<0.01). There were no differences between all test groups and the control group in the surface area of e-kit positive cells of distal colonic tissue. 2 In the proximal colonic tissue, the c-Kit protein and c-kit mRNA in the test groups decreased significantly when compared with the control group after 45 days (P all <0.01). The levels of c-Kit protein and the expression of c-kit mRNA in the group after stopping of morphine were lower than those in the groups given naloxone and in the control group, respectively after 60 days (P<0.05 and P<0.01). Conclusions: The amount of c-kit positive cells, c-Kit protein and c-kit mRNA decreased obviously in the proximal colonic tissue of morphine-induced slow-transit colonic motility. These suggest that the changes of ICCs might be one of the factors involved in the slow-transit colonic motility, which could not be reversed after stopping of morphine. However, by given naloxone, the amount of ICCs fundamentally recovered with improvement of colonic motility, this suggests that naloxone can block and promote the recovery of morphine-induced ICC alteration.

33947310414	Neuroendocrine carcinoma in digestive system: Case analysis and literature review	AIM: To analyze the originating sites, clinical manifestations, endoscopic and imaging features, pathologic findings, treatments and prognosis of patients suffered from neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) in digestive system. METHODS: A total of 209 cases, of which 7 cases were from our hospital and the other 202 cases were reported in literatures from 1994 to 2005, were classified as group A and B, respectively. Clinical presentation, therapy and prognosis of NEC arising from digestive system were discussed. RESULTS: NEC mainly occurred in stomach, pancreas, rectum, esophagus, small intestine, Vater ampullae of duodenum, liver and so on, and it had a wide spectrum of clinical presentations such as abdominal pain, epigastric distention, symptoms of wasting. Periampullary NEC might cause (recurrent) acute pancreatitis, and most of them were non-functioning neoplasms. Only about 2.4% of NEC cases presented an endocrine syndrome. NEC was classified as typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid and small cell carcinoma, and its masses varied from 0.5 to 13.0 cm in diameter, and the diagnosis of NEC depended on the features of endoscopic examination, B-ultrasound (BUS), computed tomography (CT), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and pathologic findings, especially immunohistochemical markers such as synaptophysin (Syn), cytokeratin (CK), neuro-specific enolase (NSE), chromogranin A (CgA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and (or) neurosecretory granules (NSG) observed through electronic microscopy. Operation was the dominant strategy in the treatment of NEC, assisted by post-operative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemoembolization or biotherapy. The initial treatment of functioning NEC was to control the symptoms caused by excessive hormonal production. Typical carcinoid had a better prognosis than atyptical carcinoid or small cell carcinoma, and the 5-year survival rate was as high as 70%. Other important prognostic factors consisted of the size of the mass, metastasis, and the type of surgical resection. CONCLUSION: NEC in digestive system often originates from stomach, pancreas, rectum, etc. It has miscellaneous clinical manifestations and rare cases have carcinoid syndrome. The diagnosis of NEC mainly depends on pathologic findings and operation is the first-line treatment. The prognosis of NEC is also correlated with the pathologic classifications.

34047179898	Alteration of Cajal interstitial cells and stem cell factors in colon with slow transit motility of diabetes mellitus	AIM: To observe the alterations of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and stem cell factors (SCF) in colon tissues with slow transit motility of diabetes mellitus, and study their roles and possible regulatory mechanism. METHODS: A total of 54 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly and averagely divided into diabetes group and control group. Diabetes model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Nine rats of the above two groups were killed respectively 6, 8 and 10 weeks after injection. The alterations of ICC and membrane-bound SCF (M-SCF) in the proximal colon tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot, and the serum concentration of soluble SCF (S-SCF) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The level of blood glucose was elevated while the intestinal propulsive rate was lowered with the prolonging of time (P > 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that the number of myenteric ICC was significantly higher in diabetic rats than that in the controls, and the expression of proximal colon ICC was decreased with the time prolonging. Electron microscopy exhibited damaged microstructures of colonic ICC such as swelling, vacuole-like degeneration of mitochondria and obvious decrease of organelles. Meanwhile, the serum concentration of S-SCF was remarkably lower in diabetic rats than that in the controls (6 wk: 0.93 ± 0.53 μg/L vs 1.87 ± 0.92 μg/L, P < 0.05; 8 wk: 0.78 ± 0.21 μg/L vs 1.76 ± 0.94 μg/L, P < 0.05; 10 wk 0.73 ± 0.20 μg/L vs 1.82 ± 0.96 μg/L, P < 0.05), but the content of M-SCF in the colon tissues had no significant difference between the diabetic and normal rats (P > 0.05). The alteration trend of S-SCF concentration was in accordance with that of ICC numbers. CONCLUSION: Decrease of colonic ICC quantity and serum S-SCF concentration, and damaged microstructures of ICC are demonstrated in diabetic rats with slow transit motility of colon, and these changes and their successive regulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of slow transit motility.

34047180051	Acitretin in combination with vasodilators in the treatment of six patients with systemic sclerosis	Objective: To observe the efficacy of acitretin in combination with vasodilators in the treatment of systemic sclerosis(SSc). Methods: Six in-patients and out-patients with SSc from 2000 to 2005 were analyzed. All patients were treated with acitretin 0.5-0.6mg/ (kg·d) in combination with vasodilators. Skin thickness and hardness were assessed by using the modified Rodnan score, of which reduction of more than 75% was defined as significant improvement. Results: In 6 SSc patients, 5 (83.33%) of them were accompanied by arthralgia and Raynaud's phenomenon, 1 case (16.67%) with dysphasia, no symptoms and signs suggesting other internal organs involved. Rodnan score ranged from 12 to 30(22.00±6.96) before treatment. After the combination therapy, all the clinical symptoms and signs of the patients improved. The Rodnan score decreased after 2 weeks, and continued to decrease. By the end of the 8th week, the Rodnan score was 2-12(7.17±3.92), which showed statistical difference compared with that of the pre-treatment(P<0.05). Four cases showed marked improvement, while 2 cases developed abnormal liver function and hyperlipidemia, which had no influence on the continuation of therapy. Conclusion: The preliminary study suggests that acitretin in combination with vasodilators be the choice of treatment for SSc.

3543121838	Differential diagnosis of juvenile ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis by subtypes of HLA-B27 alleles	Background: The relationship of juvenile ankylosing spondylitis(JAS) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis(JRA) with HLA-B27 alleles has been studied for about 25 years. Some researchers abroad reported that the relationship between ankylosing spondylitis and HLA-B27 allele subtypes is different from that between arthritis and HLA-B27 allele subtypes. Objective: To investigate the relationship of JAS and JRA with HLA-B27 allele subtypes and its role in the pathogenesis so as to find out the testing methods for earlier diagnosis of JAS or JRA. Design: Non-random control laboratory study. Setting, participants and interventions: A total of 60 patients diagnosed with JAS or JRA in Beijing Children's Hospital were recruited, including 5 fathers or mothers from 5 patients' families, compared with 9 normal controls (from 200 donors for bone marrow transplantation). We studied 74 cases of HLA-B27 allele subtypes and analyzed their correlation by using PCR/SSP. Main outcome measures: Correlation of JAS and JRA with HLA-B27 allele subtypes; difference of HLA-B*2704 between JAS and JRA; data of patients' families. Haplotypes analysis and homozygote analysis on patients' families showed that there existed a close link between HLA-B* 2704 and C*1202, but not with HLA-A, and that JAS had a remarkable tendency of family inheritance. Results: HLA-B*2704, *2705, *2702 and *2707 were found in the cases. In JAS group, allelic frequency of HLA-B27 was B*2704 56. 25%, B*2705 40.63% and B*2702 3.13% , respectively. However, in JRA group, it was B*2705 60.7%, B* 2704 28.57%, B*2702 3.57% and B* 2707 7.14%, respectively. Comparison between JAS and JRA showed that the allelic frequency of HLA-B*2704 in JAS patients was higher than that in JAS patients (RR = 3.21, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The susceptibility of JAS is positively associated with subtypes HLA-B*2704. Testing HLA-B27 subtypes may be a valuable marker in differential diagnosis of AS and JRA.

35848937759	Exploration on the combined role and the mechanism of fluorine and aluminum on articular chondrocyte apoptosis in rats induced by drinking brick-tea fluorosis	Objective: To investigate the combined role of fluorine and aluminum on articular chondrocyte apoptosis in rats induced by drinking tea fluorosis, and to explore the mechanism. Methods: 4-week male Wistar rats were randomized into 5 groups according to their body weights: control group, fluoride treated group, aluminum treated group, fluoride with aluminum treated group, and brick-tea treated group. The experiment lasted for 3 months. TUNEL was used to detect apoptosis expression of articular chondrocytes, and the mRNA and protein expression of iNOS, Caspase-3 in articular cartilage were determined by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry techniques. Results: 1 Compared with the control group, the chondrocyte apoptosis index was higher in every experiment group (P < 0.01) and was the highest in the fluorine with treated group (P < 0.05). 2 The combination of fluorine with aluminum had a synergistic effect on the relative mRNA levels of iNOS (F = 682.737, P < 0.01). 3 Fluorine and aluminum, solely or simultaneity ingested, could upregulate the protein expression of iNOS, Caspase-3 in articular cartilage. Conclusions: To some degree, combination of fluorine with aluminum promotes chondrocyte apoptosis.

37449027283	Role of BP180NC16a-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid in China	Background: Autoantibodies of bullous pemphigoid (BP) patients react with two components of the hemidesmosome of stratified epithelia: the BP antigen 230 (BP230) and the BP antigen 180 (BP180). Recently, strong evidence has been provided that autoantibodies to BP180 play a key role in subepidermal blister formation in BP patients, and NC16A contains an important antigen determinant of BP. Objective: To study the role of BP180NC16a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BP180NC16a-ELISA) in the diagnosis of BP in China. Methods: Sera from BP patients (n = 42) and control subjects (normal controls, n = 24; pemphigus patients, n = 18) were measured by BP180NC16a-ELISA. All BP sera were obtained at presentation from patients who had not received previous systemic treatment. The values of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels measured by ELISA were compared with those measured by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (gold standard for the diagnosis of BP) on salt-split skin. Results: Using BP180NC16a-ELISA, 41 of the 42 BP sera were positive, whereas only one of the serum samples from 24 normal controls was positive and all the pemphigus sera showed a negative result. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of BP180NC16a-ELISA were both 97.62%. There was no correlation between the mean ELISA values and IIF titers. The ELISA and IIF results were further compared and analyzed using a 2×2 contingency table, which showed that they were not significantly different. Conclusions: It is suggested that BP180NC16a-ELISA is a useful tool for the diagnosis of BP. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

39449119708	Serum levels of autoantibodies to BP180 correlate with disease activity in patients with bullous pemphigoid	Background: The 180-kDa transmembrane hemidesmosomal protein (BPAG2) has been identified as an important autoantigen in bullous pemphigoid (BP). Using the NC16A domain as the antigenic target, a highly sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of autoantibodies to BP180 was developed. Aim: To investigate the correlation of clinical severity and ELISA indices in BP. Methods: Antibody titers in the sera from 20 patients were measured using BP180NC16a-ELISA, and an analysis of the correlation of ELISA indices with disease activity was performed. Serum was obtained from each patient with BP at least three times: before the initiation of treatment, during complete disease control just before the decrease in corticosteroid, and when the dosage of corticosteroid was successfully decreased to half the initial dose. Of the 20 patients, three showed recurrence at a later stage, caused by their decision to stop treatment; serum was obtained at the early stage of recurrence. Results: ELISA indices were significantly decreased after successful therapy, although indirect immunofluorescence titers did not always show apparent correlations. Indices measured using BP180NC16a-ELISA were well correlated with disease activity. Three patients decided to stop taking their medication; subsequently (within 1-2 weeks), blisters recurred, and the levels of antibodies to BP180 increased to close to those before the initiation of treatment. Conclusion: BP180 antibody titers showed acloser correlation than indirect immunofluorescence titers to disease activity. The titer of BP180 antibody may be a useful tool for the evaluation of disease activity and for the assessment of the effectiveness of treatments in BP. © 2008 The International Society of Dermatology.

84867373794	The expression level of acetylcholine receptor in the patients with pemphigus	Objective: To study the expression of the acetylcholine receptor in different types of pemphigus patients, and investigate the relationship between the expression and disease activity of different types of pemphigus. Methods: Immunohistochemistry and ELISA were used. Results: In a total of 30 patients, the OD value of AChR IgG in peripheral blood was positive in 8 patients, among them 7 cases were pemphigus vulgaris patients and 1 pemphigus foliaceus. There was no statistical difference (P > 0.05) compared with normal controls. In the AChR-positive patients, the disease was more severe. The OD value of AChR IgG in peripheral blood declined after the disease was under control. In pemphigus vulgaris, subtype AChRM3 distributed in the basal layer as brown granules with deep color and larger particles with different sizes. The expression of AChRM3 in pemphigus foliaceus showed no significant difference compared with that of normal controls. In pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, subunit AChRα was distributed in the whole layer as brown granules with deep color and larger particles with different sizes. Conclusion: In pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus, AChR antibody expression levels are different. AChR antibody is more likely to appear in the peripheral blood of Dsg3-positive patients. In the skin biopsy of Dsg3-positive patients, the staining patterns of both AChRα protein and AChRM3 protein have changed. This shows that the Dsg3 antibodies are more likely to lead to abnormal AChR pathway.

84876571017	Antidiabetic potential of phycocyanin: Effects on KKAy mice	Context: Phycocyanin (PC) has been proven to have many therapeutic properties, but its effects on diabetes have not been investigated. Objective: Antidiabetic activity of PC isolated from Spirulina platensis was evaluated in this study. Materials and methods: Oral administration of PC (100mg/kg, once per day for 3 weeks) on KKAy mice were investigated by monitoring the changes in body weight, food intake, fasting plasma glucose level, 24h random blood glucose levels, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), glycosylated serum protein (GSP), fasting serum insulin (FINS), glycogen, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), total antioxidative capability (T-AOC) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathological changes in the pancreas were also examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Results: Administration of PC significantly decreased the body weight, fasting plasma glucose, 24h random blood glucose levels, FINS and GSP levels, TG and TC content in serum and livers, MDA content in livers (p<0.05 or p<0.01). On the other hand, glucose tolerance to glucose administration, T-AOC, and the content of glycogen in liver and muscle were enhanced following PC treatment (p<0.05 or p<0.01). Histopathological results showed that PC administration suppressed the abnormal enlargement of islets observed in the pancreas of KKAy mice. Discussion and conclusion: The antidiabetic effect of PC on KKAy mice is most likely due to its ability to enhance insulin sensitivity, amelioration of insulin resistance of peripheral target tissues and regulation of glucolipide metabolism.

84925299254	Advances in study on endoscopic therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease	Gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD) is caused by dysfunction of lower esophageal sphincter(LES), which allows the contents of stomach and duodenum to reflux into esophagus. Currently, medical and surgical therapies are the main treatment for GERD, but patients need to take life-long acid suppression and the surgical treatment has the risks of potential side effects. Endolumenal therapy as a minimally invasive approach to GERD can safely and effectively relieve the symptoms of GERD, especially Stretta radiofrequency procedure, transoral noninvasive fundoplication(TIF)and LinX reflux management system. This article reviewed the advances in study on endolumenal therapy for GERD.

47549112344	Effect of stem cell factor on colon interstitial cells of Cajal in murine with diabetes mellitus	AIM: To investigated whether exogenous stem cell factor (SCF) can improve the diabetes-associated depletion of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) in mice with diabetes mellitus (DM). METHODS: DM mice were intraperitoneally injected with streptozocin (STZ) to induce an experimental model. Male C57/BL6 mice were randomly divided into control group, DM group and DM + SCF group. The mice in DM + SCF group were given exogenous SCF (0.2 μg/kg per day, ip) for 6 wk, and the mice in control group and DM group were given the same amount of phosphate buffer (pH = 7.4). All the mice were sacrificed after 6 wk. ICC changes in the distal colon were assessed by immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and Western blot, and SCF expression in the distal colon was analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: The expression of SCF in the distal colon was significantly reduced in DM group as compared with that in the control group (178.97 ± 13.51 vs 200.25 ± 16.48, P < 0.05), accompanied with the depletion (72 ± 10 vs 102 ± 12, P < 0.05) and microscopic lesions of ICC in the distal colon. The expression of SCF in the distal colon was increased in DM + SCF group (210.14 ± 11.8, P < 0.05), along with the dramatic improvement of ICC quantity (87 ± 10, P < 0.05) and ultrastructure in the distal colon as compared with those in DM group. CONCLUSION: Exogenous SCF may improve the DM-associated depletion of colon ICC.

52649178371	Effect of the polymorphism of tumor necrosis factor-α-308 G/A gene promoter on the susceptibility to ulcerative colitis: A meta-analysis	Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex polygenic disease in which gene-environment interactions are important. Some studies have reported that proinflammatory polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor-α-308 (TNF-α-308) gene promoter (substitution G→A, designated as TNF1 and TNF2) is associated with increased UC risk. However, the results of individual studies have been inconsistent. Methods: To investigate the inconsistent findings in studies of the association of the polymorphism of TNF-α-308 gene promoter with susceptibility to UC, a systematic review of the published data was undertaken and a meta-analysis was performed. The MEDLINE database was searched for case-control studies published in English language journals from 1966 to November 2007. Data were extracted using standardized forms and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: 15 eligible studies, 7 of Europeans, 2 of Americans, and 6 of Asians including 4 East Asians, were included in the meta-analysis. An association between UC and TNF2 allele was not found in the overall population (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.84-1.96, p = 0.25). However, stratification by ethnicity indicated that there was significant association between TNF2 allele and UC in East Asians (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.08-4.77, p = 0.03). Conversely, there was no association between TNF2 allele and UC patients from the European (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.42-1.71, p = 0.65) and Asian samples (OR 1.64, 95% CI 0.98-2.74, p = 0.06). The OR for the TNF2/2+TNF2/1 genotype versus TNF1/1 genotype in samples overall and in each ethnic group showed a similar trend to those for the TNF2 allele. Conclusion: In East Asians, the TNF2 allele confers a significant risk for developing UC. There is no association between the polymorphism of TNF-α-308 gene promoter and UC in Europeans.

54249099096	Correlation of gut hormones with irritable bowel syndrome	Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder which is characterized by abdominal pain and disturbed bowel habits. The pathophysiological mechanism is complex and still remains incompletely clear. Alterations at both the central and the peripheral level are thought to contribute to the symptoms of IBS, including psychosocial factors, visceral hypersensitivity and abnormal gastrointestinal motility and secretion. Several gut peptides contribute to the regulation of gastrointestinal function, but little is known about gut hormone secretion in IBS. Methods: We evaluated the concentrations of cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), somatostatin, substance P, neuropeptide Y (NPY) in plasma and in sigmoid tissue in 40 patients with IBS and 15 age- and gender-matched controls by using radioimmunoassay. Results: IBS patients had higher plasma level of CCK (p < 0.01), and the level of CCK in the sigmoid was also increased compared with controls (p < 0.05). The levels of somatostatin and substance P in fasting plasma and in the sigmoid were not different between IBS patients and control subjects (p > 0.05), but the levels of VIP in sigmoid tissue or in plasma were higher in IBS patients than in control group (p < 0.01). The NPY levels in both plasma and the sigmoid were significantly lower in IBS patients than in controls (p < 0.05). Plasma NPY level in patients with IBS with diarrhea as a predominant bowel pattern was lower than in patients with IBS with constipation as a predominant bowel pattern. Conclusion: IBS patients have increased levels of CCK and VIP and decreased NPY levels in fasting plasma and sigmoid tissue. These alterations of VIP, CCK and NPY may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBS. Copyright © 2008 S. Karger AG.

69549135574	Research of antiviral mechanisms of action of berberine derivate HB-13 against herpes simplex virus type 2	Objective: To investigate the action mechanisms of berberine derivate HB-13 against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Methods: cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, plaque assay, FQ-PCR and Western blotting methods were applied to determine whether HB-13 had an effect of killing viruses outside Vero cells and could affect the HSV adsorbtion, release, DNA replication and proteins synthesis. Results: HB-13 had no effect on killing HSV-2 outside cells; and didn't affect HSV-2 adsorbtion and release from Vero cells; and also didn't impact HSV-2 DNA replication, but it could inhibite HSV-2 protein synthesis in a concentration dependent behavior. Conclusions HB-13 could inhibit HSV-2 protein synthesis, which was different inhibition mode of action from that of acyclovir and ACV-related nucleoside analogs.

70349641788	Overlap between gastroesophageal reflux disease and functional bowel diseases: An analysis of related factors	AIM: To investigate the overlap between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and functional bowel diseases and analyze the factors related to such overlap. METHODS: A total of 232 consecutive outpatients treated at our hospital from July 2008 to December 2008 due to sour regurgitation, heartburn and retrosternal pain were included in the study. GERD was diagnosed when the score (Sc) of reflux diagnostic questionnaire (RDQ) was greater than or equal to 12. The patients were divided into two groups: GERD patients (Sc ≤ 12) and control ones (Sc < 12). The height, weight, smoking history and drinking history of these patients were recorded. The patients were screened for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional diarrhea (FD), functional constipation (FC) and functional bloating (FB) according to Rome III criteria. The overlap between GERD and these disorders as well as the related factors were analyzed by the t-test, chi square test and logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalences of IBS, FD, FC and FB in GERD patients were higher than those in control patients (29.1% vs 11.1%, 15.2% vs 3.7%, 10.6% vs 9.9% and 2.0% vs 1.2%, respectively). The prevalence of IBS in GERD patients was significant higher than that in control patients (P < 0.005) though no significant differences were observed in prevalences of FD, FC and FB between the two groups. GERD symptom score was significantly related with the overlap between GERD and functional bowel disease (P < 0.001), while body mass index (BMI), age, sex, smoking history and drinking history had no relation with the overlap. CONCLUSION: IBS, FD, FC and FB in GERD patients are more prevalent than those in the general population, and the prevalence of IBS in GERD patients is significant higher than that in the general population. GERD symptom score has significant relation with the overlap between GERD and functional bowel diseases.

75149118187	Insulin-like growth factor-1 upregulates the expression of stem cell factor in rat colonic smooth muscle cells	AIM: To investigate the effects of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on the expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in rat colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). METHODS: Rat colonic SMCs were separated, cultured, and identified by immunofluorescence staining of α-actin. Cultured colonic SMCs were divided into IGF-1 treatment group and IGF-1 receptor antibody intervention group. Cells in the IGF-1 treatment group incubated with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 150 μg/L) of IGF-1 for different durations (0, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours), while those in the IGF-1 receptor antibody intervention group were treated with IGF-1 and different concentrations of IGF-1 receptor monoclonal antibody (0, 50, 100 and 150 μg/L). The expression of SCF in colonic SMCs was examined by Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Although IGF-1 at low concentrations (5 and 10 μg/L) had no significant impact on the expression of SCF mRNA and protein in SMCs (all P > 0.05), IGF-1 at moderate or high concentrations (50, 100 and 150 μg/L) significantly upregulated the expression of SCF mRNA and protein (all P < 0.05). The optimum concentration of IGF-1 to upregulate SCF expression in vitro was 100 μg/L (0.820 ± 0.061 vs 0.167 ± 0.015 and 1.269 ± 0.219 vs 0.560 ± 0.023, respectively; both P < 0.05), and the peak expression of SCF occurred 16 hours after incubation with IGF-1 (0.420 ± 0.034 vs 0.209 ± 0.001 and 1.407 ± 0.133 vs 0.477 ± 0.041, respectively; both P < 0.05). IGF-1 receptor monoclonal antibody could inhibit the expression of SCF in SMCs in a dose-dependent manner (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IGF-1 can upregulate the expression of SCF in colonic SMCs perhaps in an IGF-1 receptor-dependent manner.

76749127603	Roles of stem cell factor on the depletion of interstitial cells of Cajal in the colon of diabetic mice	The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) on interstitial cell of Cajal (ICC) depletion in the colon of diabetic mice. Male C57/BL6 mice were treated by a single intraperitoneally injected dose of streptozotocin, and those displaying sustained high blood glucose were selected as diabetes mellitus models. Six groups of mice were used: three groups of normal nondiabetic mice (untreated and treated with IgG or SCF antibody), and three groups of diabetic mice (untreated and treated with vehicle or SCF). Changes of the ICC quantities were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ICC morphologies were observed with transmission electron microscopy. The SCF levels in sera and colon tissues were detected by ELISA and Western blot, respectively. The nondiabetic mice treated with SCF antibody and the untreated diabetic mice showed decreased SCF levels in the sera and colonic tissues, reduced numbers of ICC, and pathological changes of the ICC ultrastructures, whereas the nondiabetic mice treated with mouse IgG showed no significant changes compared with the nondiabetic mice. The diabetic mice treated with exogenous SCF showed restored SCF levels in both sera and colon tissues and improvement in the numbers of ICC and the damages of ICC ultra-structures, whereas the vehicle control of diabetic mice showed no significant changes compared with the diabetic mice. The blood glucose remained high and unchanged with the treatment of SCF or vehicle in the diabetic mice. These results indicate that diabetic mice show a decline in the number of ICC and impairment in the ultra-structures of ICC, and these abnormalities are attributed to a deficiency in the endogenous SCF but are not related to hyperglycemia. Exogenous SCF partially reverses the pathological changes of ICC in diabetic mice. Copyright © 2010 the American Physiological Society.

77950164076	T300A polymorphism of ATG16L1 and susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases: A meta-analysis	AIM: To evaluate the association of the autophagyrelated 16-like 1 (ATG16L1 ) T300A polymorphism (rs2241880) with predisposition to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) by means of meta-analysis. METHODS: Publications addressing the relationship between rs2241880/T300A polymorphism of ATG16L1 and Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) were selected from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. To make direct comparisons between the data collected in these studies, the individual authors were contacted when necessary to generate a standardized set of data from these studies. From these data, odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies of CD were analyzed, 14 of which involved cases of UC. The variant G allele of ATG16L1 was positively associated with CD (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.26-1.39, P < 0.00001) and UC (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10, P = 0.02). For child-onset IBD, a higher G allele frequency was found for cases of CD (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.16-1.57, P = 0.0001) than for cases of UC (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.81-1.19, P = 0.84) relative to controls. CONCLUSION: The ATG16L1 T300A polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to CD and UC in adults, but different in children, which implicates a role for autophagy in the pathogenesis of IBD. © 2010 Baishideng.

77950968430	Expression of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 in rodent digestive system	AIM: To observe the regional distributions and morphological features of nesfatin-1/nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2) immunoreactive (IR) cells in the rodent digestive system. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of seven organs (pancreas, stomach, duodenum, esophagus, liver, small intestine and colon) dissected from sprague-dawley (SD) rats and institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were prepared. The regional distributions of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were observed by immunohistochemical staining. The morphological features of the nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Fresh tissues of the seven organs were prepared for Western blotting to analyze the relative protein levels of NUCB2 in each organ. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical staining showed that the nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were localized in the central part of the pancreatic islets, the lower third and middle portion of the gastric mucosal gland, and the submucous layer of the duodenum in SD rats and ICR mice. HE staining revealed that the morphological features of nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells were mainly islet cells in the pancreas, endocrine cells in the stomach, and Brunner's glands in the duodenum. Western blotting revealed that NUCB2 protein expression was higher in the pancreas, stomach and duodenum than in the esophagus, liver, small intestine and colon (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Nesfatin-1/NUCB2 IR cells are expressed in the pancreas, stomach and duodenum in rodents. These cells may play an important role in the physiological regulation of carbohydrate metabolism, gastrointestinal function and nutrient absorption. © 2010 Baishideng.

77952240690	MMPT: A thiazolidin compound inhibits the growth of lung cancer H1792 cells via Fas-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway	MMPT, a thiazolidin compound, was identified in our laboratory as a novel antineoplastic agent with a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against many human cancer cells. However, the related mechanism has yet not been revealed. In this study, we investigated the cellular and molecular events underlying the antitumous function of this compound in human lung adenocarcinoma H1792 cells, focusing on the early cytotoxic effect. Treatment of H1792 cancer cells with MMPT (0.1-100 μM for 24-72 h) resulted in a growth inhibition in a dose and time-dependent manner, determined by MTT assay. This effect was accompanied by apoptosis, evidenced by Nucleosome ELISA, H33258 stained assay, and Sub-G1 analysis. Our data showed that MMPT caused activation of caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-8, but not caspase-9. The finding that MMPT induced apoptosis through a membrane-mediated mechanism was supported by the up-regulated expression of Fas (CD95/APO-1), and Fas ligand. Overall, our results demonstrated that MMPT induced growth inhibition of H1792 cells through a Fas-mediated and caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway, which suggested that MMPT might be used as a Fas/FasL and caspases promoter to initiate lung cancer cell apoptosis. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77953100627	The clinical and immunological study of the mizolastine on the eczema and atopic dermatitis	Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of mizolastine and cetirizine in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis and eczema. The levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in patients with atopic dermatitis, eczema and healthy (normal) persons were evaluated, and the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ and TNF-α in patients with atopic dermatitis and eczema were also evaluated after three-week treatment of mizolastine and cetirizine. Methods: Ninety-two cases were enrolled in the group of mizolastine (Mizollen?), cetirizine (Zyrtec?), and control randomly. The ELISA test was used to evaluate the levels of IL-4, IL-5, TNF-α and IFN-γ in the serum. Results: The final evaluation showed that the symptoms and signs improved significantly in the groups of mizolastine and cetirizine, and mizolastine group improved better than cetirizine group and control group significantly. The levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-γ before treatment in patients with atopic dermatitis and eczema were higher than healthy (normal) group significantly (P < 0.05). There was no difference in the level of TNF-α between atopic dermatitis and eczema group and healthy (normal) group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Mizolastine is a safe, effective medicine to treat atopic dermatitis and eczema. The levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in atopic dermatitis and eczema groups are higher than healthy (normal) group. The levels of IFN-γ in atopic dermatitis group is higher than healthy (normal) group. After the intervention of mizolastine and cetirizine, the levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-γ in eczema and atopic dermatitis are decreased. The effect of mizolastine on cytokines(IL-4, IL-5) is stronger than that of cetirizine.

77955934691	Functional constipation: Implications for nursing interventions	Aims: To verify the correlation between anorectal function and psychological conditions of depression/anxiety in patients with functional constipation. The aim of this study is to explore why people with depression/anxiety have higher incidence of functional constipation and recommend innovative interventions to advance patient care of functional constipation. Design: A prospective correlational design. Methods: Anorectal manometry was performed on functional constipation patients (n = 70) through the Medtronic Synectics PC Polygraf, while the psychological condition was tested by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Twenty normal controls were also studied. Results: Compared with controls, (1) functional constipation patients displayed higher squeezing pressure, defaecation thresholds and maximal volume of tolerance (p < 0·01), and there was no significant difference in anorectal resting pressure, defaecating pressure, minimum relaxation volume and first sensation (p > 0·05). (2) Functional constipation patients showed higher depression/anxiety scores (p < 0·01). (3) The anorectal squeezing pressure was negatively correlated with anxiety and depression scores, while the first sensation and maximal volume of tolerance was positively correlated with depression score (p < 0·05). Conclusions: Abnormal anorectal function correlates to depression/anxiety levels indicating that depression/anxiety may contributes to functional constipation. The possible pathology is via brain-gut axis. Relevance to clinical practice: The study indicates that nurses should pay attention to the patients' psychological needs, especially to those interested in seeing the physician and doing unnecessary examinations repeatedly to find any organic disease. Integrated nursing intervention should be applied to improve patients' psychological adaptation and boost the functional constipation therapeutic effect. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

77957356420	Analysis of Dongbi longan with isoenzyme and RAPD technologies	Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is one of the most important subtropical fruit trees in Fujian province. Due to little genetic background, the development of longan resources study was restricted. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and POD isoenzyme techniques were used to study the genetic polymorphism and relationship among strains of Dongbi longan. Twenty two arbitrary 10mer primers were used in RAPD analysis of 13 Dongbi longan strains. A total of 124 bands were amplified from 13 samples, each primer pair produces 3 (S299) to 9 (S60) bands, and the average bands were 5.64. The RAPD results showed that the genetic comparability was significantly high and there was high genetic stability among 13 strains, but genes varied with the time and environment. Compared to RAPD results, there was no significant difference in POD isoenzyme among 13 samples from POD isoenzyme gel. According to the results, we concluded that RAPD technology is more suitable than POD isoenzyme technology for longan germplasm resources analysis.

77956705403	Colorectal and rectocolonic reflexes in canines: Involvement of tone, compliance, and anal sphincter relaxation	Distention of the proximal colon may have inhibitory or excitatory effects on the rectum and vice versa. The reflexes between the proximal colon and the rectum have not been well studied due to difficulties in accessing the proximal colon. The aim of this study was to investigate the reflex responses and their mechanisms between the proximal colon and the rectum in consideration of distention-related changes in tone and compliance of these regions as well as anal sphincter relaxation in a canine model. Proximal colon/rectal tone, compliance, and anal sphincter relaxation were investigated in six dogs chronically implanted with a proximal colon cannula while in the fasting state and during proximal colon distention or rectal distention. It was found that: 1) both rectal distention and proximal colon distention significantly and substantially decreased the compliance of the opposite regions, and guanethidine abolished proximal colon distention-induced changes in rectal compliance; 2) rectal/proximal colon distension decreased proximal colonic/rectal tone, and guanethidine abolished both of these inhibitory effects; 3) the anal sphincter was more sensitive to rectal distention than proximal colon distention; and 4) the minimal distention pressure required to induce anal inhibitory reflex was lower for rectal distention than proximal colon distention. It was concluded that distention-related changes in tone and compliance suggest the long inhibitory reflexes between the proximal colon and the rectum with the sympathetic involvement in rectal responses. The anal sphincter is more sensitive to the distention of the rectum than that of the proximal colon.

79551502769	Distribution of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 in the intestinal tract and its effect on GLP-1 secretion	AIM: To detect the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in the intestinal tissue and to assess the possible effects of UCP2 on GLP-1 secretion in the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: The expression of UCP2 mRNA and protein in the gastrointestinal tract was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. Co-localization of UCP2 with GLP-1 was detected by immunohistochemistry. The level of serum GLP-1 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: UCP2 was primarily expressed in mucosal epithelial cells and co-localized with GLP-1 in the gastrointestinal mucosa. Glucose administration induced strong expression of UCP2 in the colon of C57BL/6J mice. UCP2-deficient mice showed an increased glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion compared with wild-type littermates (6.9000 ± 0.25, 5.5600 ± 0.42 vs 3.5408 ± 0.18, both P < 0.01; 9.3500 ± 0.95, 7.8600 ± 0.25 vs 3.7322 ± 0.13, both P < 0.01). Taken together, these results suggest an inhibitory effect of UCP2 on glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion. CONCLUSION: The expression of UCP2 in the mouse gastrointestinal tract can be strongly induced by glucose administration. UCP2 serves as a negative regulator of glucose-induced GLP-1 secretion.

79551503146	Intracerebroventricular injection of leptin inhibits gastric emptying but has no effect on intestinal transit in rats	AIM: To investigate whether injection of leptin into the lateral cerebral ventricle has impact on gastrointestinal motility in rats. METHODS: Fifty-two female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: normal control group and leptin group. The leptin group was further divided into three subgroups for detection at 1, 3, and 5 h. For intracerebroventricular infusion, a guide cannula was fixed into the lateral cerebral ventricle one week before the experiment. Under no anesthesia, leptin (3.5 g/L) was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle through the implanted guide cannula. Equal volume of saline was injected as a control. After the injection, rats were subjected to measurement of the rate of gastric emptying and the rate of intestinal transit. RESULTS: The rate of gastric emptying decreased more significantly in the three leptin subgroups than in the normal control group (54.7% ± 8.3%, 54.6% ± 9.3%, 57.4% ± 8.9% vs 70.0% ± 6.1%, all P <0.05). However, there is no significant difference in the rate of intestinal transit between the leptin subgroups and normal control group (41.1% ± 4.9%, 49.5% ± 13.6%, 43.6% ± 5.5% vs 43.0% ± 6.3%, all P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intracerebroventricular injection of leptin inhibits gastric emptying but has no effect on intestinal transit in rats.

79955539064	Transfection with siRNA against ERK1/2 inhibits IGF-1-induced stem cell factor expression in colonic smooth muscle cells	AIM: To investigate how insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) regulates the expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). METHODS: After rat colonic SMCs were treated with different concentrations of IGF-1 (0, 50, 100, 150 μg/L) for different durations (0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60 min), the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and SCF were determined by RT-PCR and Western blot. Rat colonic SMCs were then transfected with siRNA against ERK1/2 to examine the impact of ERK1/2 down-regulation on IGF-1-induced SCF expression. RESULTS: After treatment with IGF-1, the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in colonic SMCs reached a peak at about 15 min (0.417 ± 0.036 vs 0.101 ± 0.015; P < 0.05). The optimal concentration of IGF-1 to induce the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and SCF was 100 μg/L (0.790 ± 0.051 vs 0.336 ± 0.013; 0.765 ± 0.061 vs 0.289 ± 0.021, both P < 0.05). After treatment with IGF-1, the expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and SCF in colonic SMCs transfected with siRNA against ERK1/2 were lower than those in the control group (0.284 ± 0.021 vs 0.732 ± 0.005; 0.256 ± 0.015 vs 0.712 ± 0.023; 0.219 ± 0.020 vs 0.673 ± 0.013; 0.621 ± 0.027 vs 1.725 ± 0.012; 0.821 ± 0.019 vs 1.751 ± 0.043; 0.275 ± 0.061 vs 0.531 ± 0.047; all P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IGF-1 treatment up-regulated the expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and SCF in colonic SMCs, while transfection with siRNA against ERK1/2 down-regulated IGF-1-induced expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and SCF, suggesting that the ERK/MAPK pathway may be involved in IGF-1-induced expression of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and SCF.

79955932260	Design and synthesis of O-GlcNAcase inhibitors via 'click chemistry' and biological evaluations	Protein O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to play an important role in a number of biological processes, including regulation of the cell cycle, DNA transcription and translation, signal transduction, and protein degradation. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is responsible for the removal of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) from serine or threonine residues, and thus plays a key role in O-GlcNAc metabolism. Potent OGA inhibitors are useful tools for studying the cellular processes of O-GlcNAc, and may be developed as drugs for the treatment neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, Cu(I)-catalyzed 'Click' cycloaddition reactions between glycosyl azides and alkynes were exploited to generate inhibitory candidates of OGA. Enzymatic kinetic screening revealed that compound 7 was a potent competitive inhibitor of human O-GlcNAcase (K

79955740864	Changes in quality of life during biofeedback for people with puborectalis dyssynergia: Generic and disease-specific measures	Aim. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in symptoms and quality of life in people with puborectalis dyssynergia after biofeedback by using Short Form-36 and Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire. Background. Biofeedback is an effective treatment in clinical symptoms for puborectalis dyssynergia. However, little is known about the degree of the variation in the quality of life for these people after biofeedback. Method. Thirty-six people with puborectalis dyssynergia were studied between June 2006 and March 2008. A bowel symptom record, a generic quality of life measure - the Short Form-36 and a disease-specific measure - the Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire were recorded before and after biofeedback. Findings. Thirty-one people rated their satisfaction with behavioural treatment as 'major' or 'fair' and substantial symptom improvements occurred. Before treatment, seven of Short Form-36 subscales (except bodily pain) were significantly lower in people with puborectalis dyssynergia than those in healthy individuals. Following treatment, all subcategories except general health showed improvement surpassing pretreatment baseline values and equalling those for normal. The total Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life Questionnaire score also dramatically improved as did all subscales. The nurses continually encouraged the participants, increased participants' motivation and got good outcomes. Conclusion. Patient-centred functional status outcomes measured by general and disease-specific instruments give critical data, from which to inform patient management. The nurses should give psycho-social support and increase the participants' motivation during training. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

79957801333	Insulin regulates the expression of stem cell factor in rat colonic smooth muscle cells	AIM: To investigate the effect of insulin on the expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in rat colonic smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Rat colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were separated by mechanical and enzymatic methods and identified by immunofluorescence staining of α-actin. Identified colonic SMCs were randomly divided into two groups: cells treated with different concentrations of insulin (0, 2.5, 5, 20, 40, 80 mg/L) and those treated with insulin for different durations (0, 8, 16, 24 h). The expression of SCF was detected by Western blot and RT-PCR. MTT assay was used to measure the proliferation of colonic SMCs. RESULTS: At a concentration of 5 mg/L, insulin remarkably promoted the proliferation of colonic SMCs (0.052 ± 0.006 vs 0.018 ± 0.006, P < 0.05). Insulin at a concentration of 2.5, 5 or 20 mg/L promoted SCF expression in colonic SMCs (protein: 0.735 ± 0.035, 0.754 ± 0.057, 0.741 ± 0.051 vs 0.658 ± 0.024; mRNA: 0.688 ± 0.077, 0.690 ± 0.080, 0.698 ± 0.074 vs 0.528 ± 0.053; all P < 0.05), but there were no marked differences in the expression levels of SCF protein and mRNA among these three groups of cells. When the dosage of insulin was elevated to 40 mg/L, SCF expression reached its peak (protein: 0.899 ± 0.048 vs 0.658 ± 0.024; mRNA: 0.938 ± 0.117 vs 0.528 ± 0.053; both P < 0.05). The expression of SCF reached the peak at 16 hours after insulin treatment (protein: 0.899 ± 0.011 vs 0.628 ± 0.015; mRNA: 1.038 ± 0.053 vs 0.709 ± 0.042; both P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Insulin promotes cell proliferation and up-regulates SCF expression in rat colonic SMCs.

80053960387	Role of esophageal manometry in evaluation of pneumatic dilatation therapy on achalasia	Background: Achalasia is the functional disorder of primary esophageal motility, and one of its treatments is pneumatic dilatation therapy. Aims: To appraise the role of esophageal manometry in assessment of pneumatic dilatation therapy on achalasia. Methods: Data of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the esophageal body by esophageal manometry before and after pneumatic dilatation therapy in twenty-one patients with achalasia were recorded and analyzed. Results: The symptoms of dysphagia and reflux of twenty-one patients were relieved after dilatation. No significant differences were found in the LES length before and after dilatation. The LES resting pressure, LES relaxation pressure decreased markedly (P<0.01) and the LES relaxation rate increased significantly after dilatation (P<0.05). No significant differences were found in the incidence of simultaneous contraction waves and peristaltic wave after swallowing before and after dilatation. Secondary contraction waves and the resting pressure of esophageal body higher than that of the stomach were found in fewer patients after dilatation (P<0.01). Conclusions: The pneumatic dilatation therapy could increase significantly the LES relaxation rate, and decrease significantly the LES resting pressure, LES relaxation pressure, the resting pressure of esophageal body and the incidence of secondary contraction waves. The symptoms of the patients were relieved after dilatation. The esophageal manometry plays an important role in evaluation of pneumatic dilatation therapy on achalasia.

Biofeedback therapy is one of the effective treatments of FC. Aims: To explore the effect of biofeedback therapy on clinical symptoms and psychological status in patients with FC. Methods: Seventy-eight patients with FC defined by Rome II criteria were enrolled and received biofeedback training. Bowel symptoms score, colon transit time, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were recorded to assess the effects before and after treatment. Results: The overall efficacy rate of biofeedback therapy was about 79.5%. Before biofeedback therapy, score of SAS (39±8 vs. 31±13, P<0.01) and SDS (52±9 vs. 42±11, P<0.01) in FC patients were significantly higher than those in Chinese norm. After biofeedback therapy, score of SAS (33±7 vs. 39±8, P<0.01) and SDS (46±8 vs. 52±9, P<0.01) improved significantly. Conclusions: Biofeedback therapy can improve not only clinical symptoms, but also the abnormal psychological status in FC patients.

80054029087	Expression of high mobility group box 1 protein in colitis and its relationship with injury of colon mucosal barrier in mice	Background: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a non-specific chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and its etiology has not been known clearly. Recently more attention has been paid on the role of high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and injury of colon mucosal barrier in UC. Aims: To investigate the expression of HMGB1 in colitis and its relationship with injury of colon mucosal barrier in mice. Methods: Forty-eight BALB/c mice were randomly divided into control group (n=12) and three model groups (n=36). Colitis model was established by 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Twelve mice in model groups were sacrificed separately on the 1st, 4th and 7th day. Histological score and Evans Blue (EB) content of colon were determined. The expressions of HMGB1 mRNA and protein in colonic tissue were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. The relationships between HMGB1 expression and colonic histological score, EB content were analyzed. Results: No statistically significant difference was found in colonic histological score, EB content, expressions of HGBM1 mRNA and protein at the 1st day in model group and control group. Compared with control group, the above all mentioned indexes increased obviously in model group at the 4th and 7th day (P<0.05). There were positive correlations between HMGB1 mRNA and protein expressions and colonic histological score, EB content at the 4th and 7th day. Conclusions: As a late mediator, HMGB1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated injury of mucosal barrier, and may become a novel promising target for treating UC clinically.

80054030915	Alterations of interstitial cells of cajal and stem cell factor in diabetic colon dysmotility and the interventional effect of insulin	Background: Abnormality of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) is suggested to be one of the important factors in diabetic gastrointestinal dysmotility. Aims: To observe the changes of ICC and its Kit receptor ligand/stem cell factor (SCF) in diabetic rats with slow transit colon dysmotility, and to investigate the influence of insulin intervention on colon dysmotility and ICC. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into normal control group, diabetic model group, and three insulin intervention groups treated with different dosages of insulin (8, 12 and 16 U/kg per day). The animals were sacrificed at the 6th, 8th and 10th week after modeling. The alterations of ICC in proximal colonic tissue were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and electron microscopy, and the expression of serum and colonic SCF was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results: Gastrointestinal transit rate in the diabetic model rats decreased significantly, and the amount of ICC in proximal colonic tissue was reduced with destruction of ultrastructure. The serum and colonic expression of soluble SCF (S-SCF) and serum insulin level also decreased significantly in the diabetic model rats. Low-dosage insulin intervention could accelerate the gastrointestinal transit, increase the amount of ICC and reverse its ultrastructural changes, while no significant improvement was observed in moderate- and high-dosage insulin intervention groups. Conclusions: Decline of serum insulin level and the subsequent lowering of S-SCF and decrease of amount of ICC in colonic tissue with destruction in ultrastructure might be one of the underlying mechanisms of slow transit colon dysmotility in diabetic rats. Low-dosage insulin can improve the abnormality of ICC and colon dysmotility.

80054054682	Role of heme oxygenase and interstitial cells of Cajal in colonic dysmotility of diabetic rats	Background: Endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), which is catalyzed by heme oxygenase (HO), has been suggested to be an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The relationship between HO and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) has been concerned in researches of gastrointestinal dysmotility in diabetes mellitus (DM). Aims: To investigate the effects and relationship of HO and ICC on colonic dysmotility in DM rats. Methods: DM model with colonic slow-transit dysmotility in rats were established. Six weeks later, the DM rats were randomized into DM group without intervention, DM+Hemin (inducer of HO) group and DM+ZnPP (inhibitor of HO) group, eight rats were in each group. Nine weeks later, GI propulsion rate was tested, expressions of HO-1, HO-2 and c-kit in colonic tissue were detected by Western blotting, and co-expression of c-kit with HO-1/HO-2 was measured by indirect double-labelling immunofluorescence. Results: The GI propulsion rate of DM+Hemin group was significantly decreased compared to that of the DM group, while that of the DM+ZnPP group was significantly increased compared to the DM group (both P<0.05). There was no significant difference on the expression of HO-1 in proximal and distal colon between the controls and the DM group, while that of the DM+Hemin group was much higher (P<0.05), and the DM+ZnPP group almost with no expression. There was no significant difference on the expression of HO-2 in proximal colon between DM group, DM+Hemin group and DM+ZnPP group, all were lower than that of the controls (P<0.05). There was no significant difference on the expression of HO-2 in distal colon among the four groups. The expression of c-kit in proximal and distal colon of the DM group was significantly decreased than that of the controls (P<0.05), while that of the DM+Hemin group was slightly lower and that of the DM+ZnPP group was significantly higher (P<0.05). All the groups displayed co-expression of c-kit and HO-1/HO-2, especially in myenteric nerve plexus, except for the DM+ZnPP group, with almost no co-expression of c-kit and HO-1. Conclusions: Decreased number of ICC and changeable expression of HO in colonic tissue might be one of the mechanisms in colonic slow-transit dysmotility in DM rats.

Based on protein sequence analysis, we found N terminal 1-350 amino acids of OGA (sOGA) has high antigenicity and hydrophilicity and then constructed it into plasmid pET28a vector. First, we optimized the expression of sOGA in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (0.05 mmol/L IPTG, 10 hours) and purified it with the Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography respectively. SDS-PAGE verified the molecular weight (45 kDa) and the purity (>95%) of sOGA and the purified protein was subjected to immunize New Zealand rabbits. Finally, we obtained OGA polyclonal antibody by affinity purifying the antiserum with CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads. Western blotting and ELISA assay showed that this antibody could recognize three OGA isoforms with high specificity and the sensitivity was 0.11 ng/mL (the titer was 1:80000). These results indicated the prepared polyclonal antibody of OGA can be used for the biological function study of OGA. © 2011 CJB All rights reserved.

80855149024	Cutaneous tuberculosis: A diagnostic and therapeutic study of 20 cases	Cutaneous tuberculosis is showing a resurgence. It continues to be one of the most elusive and difficult diseases to diagnose in dermatological practice. We sought to describe the clinical manifestations, laboratory features, and antituberculous therapy in cases of cutaneous tuberculosis. Twenty cases of cutaneous tuberculosis were observed in this study. Of the 20 cases, seven were in women (35%) and 13 were in men (65%). There were eight (40%) cases of lupus vulgaris, four (20%) cases of orificial tuberculosis, four (20%) cases of tuberculosis verrucosa cutis, two (10%) cases of scrofuloderma, and two (10%) cases of primary inoculation tuberculosis. In total, 20 strains of acid-fast bacilli were isolated by culture in Löwenstein-Jensen medium at 37°C. Mycobacterial species identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay showed that all strains were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In vitro susceptibility testing by use of absolute concentration method showed that the 20 strains were sensitive to rifampin, ethambutol, and isoniazid; however, two strains were resistant to streptomycin. All of the patients responded favourably to antituberculous treatment. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin disease that should still be thought much of in mainland China, and in this study lupus vulgaris is the most common clinical presentation. © 2010 Informa Healthcare USA on behalf of Informa UK Ltd.

84858451419	Changes of sodium iodide symporter regulated by IGF-I and TGF-β1 in mammary gland cells from lactating mice at different iodine levels	The sodium/iodide symporter (SLC5A5, also known as NIS) is a transmembrane glycoprotein. Physiologically, iodide transportation in the mammary gland occurs during late pregnancy and lactation. To identify factors that may regulate this process at different iodine levels, we have studied the expression of NIS gene and protein in cultured mammary gland explants from lactating mice by real-time quantitative PCR and In-Cell Western methods. Mammary gland cells were grown in media with different levels of iodine for 24 h. The iodine treatment groups consist of low iodine group I (LI-I, 0 μg/l), low iodine group II (LI-II, 5 μg/l), control group (C, 50 μg/l), high iodine group I (HI-I, 3,000 μg/l), and high iodine group II (HI-II, 10,000 μg/l). The cells were then incubated with or without insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) or transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) for another 24 h. We found that iodine inhibited NIS mRNA and protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. IGF-I and TGF-β1 further decreased NIS mRNA and protein expression that iodine inhibited at different iodine levels. In summary, we have shown that iodine downregulated NIS expression in cultured mammary gland explants from the lactating mouse. IGF-I and TGF-β1 inhibited NIS mRNA and protein expression in the mammary gland under different iodine levels. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84858828426	Effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 on expression of stem cell factor in colonic smooth muscle cells from diabetic rats	Background: Deficiency and ultrastructural changes of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) may be associated with the gastrointestinal dysmotility in diabetes mellitus (DM). Previous studies have demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may induce the gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells (SMC) of normal rats to express stem cell factor (SCF), which is necessary for the development and phenotype maintenance of ICC. Aims: To investigate the effect of IGF-1 on expression of SCF in colonic SMC from DM rats and its signal transduction pathway. Methods: DM rat model was established by streptozotocin. Colonic SMC isolated from normal and DM rats were cultured and then incubated with different concentrations (0, 50, 100 and 150 μg/L) of IGF-1 for different time durations (0, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours), and some were pretreated with MEK inhibitor PD98059 or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 before IGF-1 intervention. Expression of SCF in SMC was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: Growth of colonic SMC from DM rats was slower than those from normal rats. Only low level of SCF (mRNA and protein) was expressed in both normal and DM colonic SMC cultured in serum-free medium. Increased expression of SCF was induced by IGF-1 with the maximum effective concentration located at 100 μg/L, and the peak time of increment was 16 hours in normal control group and 24 hours in DM group. The IGF-1-induced SCF expression was partially inhibited by pretreatment of PD98059, whereas LY294002 had no such effect. Conclusions: Expression of SCF in colonic SMC from normal and DM rats can be induced by IGF-1 (0-100 μg/L for 0-24 hours) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This effect is partially mediated by ERKMAPK pathway and is more prominent in normal rats.

84859804719	The effect of biofeedback training on patients with functional constipation	The aim of this prospective quasi-experimental study was to explore the influence of biofeedback training on patients with functional constipation (FC). Changes in clinical symptoms, psychological status, quality of life, and autonomic nervous function in 21 FC patients before and after biofeedback training were investigated. The psychological status and quality of life were evaluated with the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and a Chinese version of the MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Autonomic nervous function was assessed on the basis of heart rate variability recorded with a HANS-1000 autonomic nervous biofeedback apparatus. After a complete course of training (10 sessions), clinical symptoms were greatly improved (p < .01), and the SAS and SDS scores were markedly decreased. There was a significant difference in the SAS and SDS scores before and after biofeedback (p < .01). The scores of general health perceptions, physical functioning, emotional role functioning, bodily pain, and vitality were increased significantly (p < .05), especially the scores of general health perceptions and emotional role functioning (p < .01), which indicated that quality of life in FC patients was significantly improved. No marked improvement of autonomic nervous function was found. Although a slight improvement in autonomic nervous activity was found, there was no significant statistical findings (p > .05). We conclude that biofeedback training can improve clinical symptoms, psychological status, and quality of life in FC patients, but further research is needed to determine whether biofeedback training can improve the autonomic nervous function in FC patients. © 2012 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.

84859947975	Analysis of sex differences in anorectal motor and sensory functions in patients with functional constipation	Gender is an important confounding factor in studies on anorectal sensorimotor functions in patients with functional constipation (FC). Aims: To analyze the anorectal motor and sensory functions in FC patients and their sex differences. Methods: Two hundred and seventy-one FC patients fulfilling Rome III criteria and inclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Twenty-four healthy subjects were selected and served as controls. All subjects received anorectal manometry, and the FC patients were classified into four types according to the results of manometry. Differences in sensorimotor parameters and manometric types between healthy subjects of different gender and between FC patients and healthy subjects of same gender were analyzed respectively. Results: In comparison with healthy females, the anal squeeze pressure in healthy males were significantly increased (P<0.05), and the minimum relaxation volume (MRV) of rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR) and the threshold for desire to defecation were significantly decreased (P<0.05). When compared with healthy subjects of same gender, both male and female FC patients had higher anal residual pressure during bearing down (P<0.05), and male FC patients had higher MRV of RAIR, higher threshold for desire to defecation and higher maximum tolerable volume (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed in rectal sensory parameters between female FC patients and female healthy subjects. According to the results of manometry, male FC patients presented as anal spasm type predominantly (65.1%), while female FC patients were anal spasm type (38.9%), rectal inertia type (31.4%) and normal type (25.9%) in turn. Conclusions: Significant sex differences in anorectal motor and sensory functions are seen in FC patients. Inappropriate contraction of anal sphincter muscle during bearing down is seen in both male and female FC patients, especially male FC patients. In addition, decreased rectal sensitivity is frequent in male FC patients and colorectal inertia is frequent in female FC patients.

Methods: Spheres with volumes ranging from 0.5 to 16.0 ml and target/background activity concentration (T/N) ratio of 164.13:1, 32.96:1 and 12.69:1, as well as those without background were established. The relationship between the threshold and the target volume, target/background activity concentration ratio and imaging mode was observed. Results: The threshold of the spheres with the volumes ≥2.0 ml ranged from 36.80% to 43.70% (average 39.59%). The threshold of the spheres with the volumes <2.0 ml ranged from 39.30% to 50.90% (average 45.98%). There was no significant difference among the average thresholds of spheres with volumes ≥2.0 ml (P>0.05). The thresholds of spheres with the volumes <2.0 ml significantly decreased as the volumes increased (P=0.015). When the T/N ratio>12.69:1, the thresholds of spheres were not obviously affected by the change of the T/N ratio (P>0.05). There was no significant difference of the threshold value between 2D and 3D imaging mode in the same time. Conclusion: The thresholds of the spheres with the volumes ≥2.0 ml were not changed obviously as the volumes increased, so the threshold 40% is recommended as the contour threshold.

84862797938	Sex differences in the symptoms and psychological factors that influence quality of life in patients with irritable bowel syndrome	Objective: To investigate the relationship between gender and symptomatology, psychological factors, and quality of life (QOL) in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Methods: The diagnosis of IBS was made on the basis of the Rome III Criteria. A physician obtained demographic and symptom data, Zung Self-Rated Anxiety and Depression Scale scores (SAS/SDS), and IBS-specific quality-of-life ratings (IBS-QOL). Results: Of the 4015 patients approached, 452 patients were diagnosed with IBS. Age ranged from 14 to 79 years (44.05±14.89 years) and the male to female ratio was 1: 1.3. The gender composition between the four IBS subtypes differed significantly (P<0.01). Male and female patients differed in their rating of abdominal pain/discomfort in terms of severity and time (P<0.01). Groups did not differ with regard to attack frequency. Female patients more frequently reported headache, dizziness, backache, muscular soreness, inappetence, insomnia, and fatigue (P<0.01). In comparison with men, anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in women (P<0.01). Severity, duration, and frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort did not correlate with IBS-QOL scores. Insomnia/fatigue was negatively correlated with IBS-QOL scores (P<0.01). SAS and SDS scores were negatively correlated with IBS-QOL (total score and each subscale; P<0.01). Conclusion: There are significant gender differences in the symptoms, psychological rating, and QOL scores in IBS. Somatic symptoms, anxiety, and depression all contribute to the negative impact of IBS. Our findings suggest that gender differences should be recognized in IBS treatment. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

84862290642	Cloning of NAD-SDH cDNA from plum fruit and its expression and characterization	A full-length cDNA consisting of 1444 bp for NAD dependent sorbitol dehydrogenase (NAD-SDH) was cloned from fruit of plum (Prunus salicina var. cordata cv. Younai) by means of RT-PCR and RACE. The cDNA containing an open reading frame (ORF) of 1101 bp encoded a polypeptide of 367 amino acid residues. The maltose binding protein fusion SDH (MBP-SDH) was expressed and partially purified from Escherichia coli cells, and biochemical properties of MBP-SDH and SDH cleaved from the fusion protein by factor Xa were characterized. The MBP-SDH had the specific affinity for NAD and was able to oxidize sorbitol, xylitol, l-ribitol and mannitol but not ethyl alcohol, arabitol and other polyols. The optimum pH for the oxidation of sorbitol and the reduction of fructose was 9.0 and 7.0, respectively; the maximum reaction rate occurred when temperature increased up to 50 °C in the presence of sorbitol. The MBP-SDH with a subunit of 80 kDa appears to be a hexamer. Its molecular weight was 478.6 kDa estimated by gel filtration and 493.2 kDa estimated using native linear gradient PAGE. The K

84863272670	Identification of a specific inhibitor of nOGA - A caspase-3 cleaved O-GlcNAcase variant during apoptosis	O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification of serines/threonines on cytoplasmic proteins is a significant signal regulating cellular processes such as cell cycle, cell development, and cell apoptosis. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) is responsible for the removal of O-GlcNAc, and it thus plays a critical role in O-GlcNAc metabolism. Interestingly, OGA can be cleaved by caspase-3 into two fragments during apoptosis, producing an N-terminal fragment (1-413 a.a.), termed nOGA. Here, using 4-MU-GlcNAc (4-methylumbelliferyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy- β-D-glucopyranoside) as substrate, we found that the nOGA fragment retains high glycosidase activity. To probe the role of nOGA in apoptosis, it is essential to develop a potent and specific nOGA inhibitor. However, many reported inhibitors active at nanomolar concentrations (including PUGNAc, STZ, GlcNAc-statin, and NAG-thiazoline) against full-length OGA were not potent for nOGA. Next, we screened a small triazole-linked carbohydrate library and first identified compound 4 (4-pyridyl-1-(2′-deoxy-2′-acetamido-β-D- glucopyranosyl)-1,2,3-triazole) as a potent and competitive inhibitor for nOGA. This compound shows 15-fold selectivity for nOGA (K

84863140941	How to diagnose and manage patients with Barrett's esophagus in China	In order to prevent the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE)-related esophageal cancer in China and facilitate the communication of research results among different centers, we propose using standardized diagnostic criteria and taking a conservative approach to diagnose and manage BE patients. BE patients without dysplasia need to be treated medically. For low-grade dysplasia, an annual endoscopy with biopsies is recommended, along with medical therapy. For high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal carcinoma, an endoscopic or surgical intervention is suggested. All BE patients should be followed up closely. © 2012 The Authors.

Methods The wholebody imaging performances, the resolutions parallel and perpendicular to the scan direction, and the scan constancy were measured in different scan speeds and counts. Results There was no significant difference of the resolutions between both directions and two positions at the center of the view of field and the position 10 cm from the center. The resolutions did not vary with the scan speed and the counts obviously. The average and maximum absolute value of the scan constancy decreased with increasing counts, and it did not vary with the scan speed obviously. Conclusion The resolutions of wholebody imaging are independent to the scan speed and counts, while the scan constancy depends on the counts, but not on the scan speed.

84865121664	DNA origami as a carrier for circumvention of drug resistance	Although a multitude of promising anti-cancer drugs have been developed over the past 50 years, effective delivery of the drugs to diseased cells remains a challenge. Recently, nanoparticles have been used as drug delivery vehicles due to their high delivery efficiencies and the possibility to circumvent cellular drug resistance. However, the lack of biocompatibility and inability to engineer spatially addressable surfaces for multi-functional activity remains an obstacle to their widespread use. Here we present a novel drug carrier system based on self-assembled, spatially addressable DNA origami nanostructures that confronts these limitations. Doxorubicin, a well-known anti-cancer drug, was non-covalently attached to DNA origami nanostructures through intercalation. A high level of drug loading efficiency was achieved, and the complex exhibited prominent cytotoxicity not only to regular human breast adenocarcinoma cancer cells (MCF 7), but more importantly to doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells, inducing a remarkable reversal of phenotype resistance. With the DNA origami drug delivery vehicles, the cellular internalization of doxorubicin was increased, which contributed to the significant enhancement of cell-killing activity to doxorubicin-resistant MCF 7 cells. Presumably, the activity of doxorubicin-loaded DNA origami inhibits lysosomal acidification, resulting in cellular redistribution of the drug to action sites. Our results suggest that DNA origami has immense potential as an efficient, biocompatible drug carrier and delivery vehicle in the treatment of cancer. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

84864465473	Different levels of iodine intake and thyroid morphological changes of lactating rats and their newborns	Objective: To study the morphological and functional changes of thyroid in lactating rats and their offspring in iodine deficiency and iodine excess animal models. Methods: One hundred and twenty Wistar rats(30 males and 90 females) were selected. Based on their body weight, the 90 females were stratified and randomly divided into five groups(18 in each group): low iodine group 1 and group 2(fed with low iodine feed and deionized water containing iodine of 0, 5 μg/L) ; high iodine group 1, group 2 and control group (feed with normal diet and deionized water containing iodine of 3000, 10 000, 50 μg/L). After fed for 3 month, all female rats were mated with males in a ratio of 3 : 1. After birth for 10 days, 8 female rats and their offspring in each group were sacrificed. Changes of thyroid were observed by naked eyes. The thyroid weight was measured and pathological changes of thyroids were observed under light microscope. Results: Circled digit oneAbsolute and relative weight of lactating rats thyroid in low iodine group 1 and group 2[(92.02 ± 24.40), (77.11 ± 23.32)mg, (0.509 ± 0.072), (0.384 ± 0.089) mg/kg] were much higher than that of control group[(17.41 ± 9.25)mg, (0.102 ± 0.016)mg/kg, all P < 0.05]. Absolute and relative weight of lactating rats thyroid in high iodine group 1 and group 2[(8.22 ± 0.41), (9.42 ± 0.43)mg, (0.047 ± 0.006), (0.035 ± 0.005)mg/kg] were lower than that of control group(all P < 0.05). Absolute and relative weight of lactating rats and their offspring thyroid was decreased with increase of iodide intake in the diet. Circled digit twoThyroid enlargement of lactating rats in low iodine group 1 and group 2 was evident, but that of high iodine group 1 and group 2 was not. Circled digit threeEpithelial cell hyperplasia and smaller follicular cavity were observed in low iodine group 1 and group 2 under light microscope. Epithelial cell deformation and mostly flat were observed in high iodine group 1 and group 2. Conclusions: Thyroid morphology is changed with iodide intake in the lactating rats and their offspring, and the changes are consistent between female rats and their newborns.

84867496918	Prucalopride in the treatment of chronic constipation in patients from the Asia-Pacific region: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study	Background The study evaluated efficacy and safety of the 2mg dose of prucalopride compared to placebo in patients with chronic constipation (CC) from the Asia-Pacific region. Methods Randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase III study with 2-week run-in, 12-week treatment phase, and 1-week follow-up. Adult patients with CC (≤2 spontaneous bowel movements per week) received 2mg prucalopride or placebo, once-daily, for 12weeks. Primary efficacy measure was percentage of patients with average of ≥3 spontaneous complete bowel movements (SCBMs) per week (Responders) during the 12-week treatment. A key secondary endpoint was Responders during first 4weeks of treatment. Other efficacy assessments were based on patient diaries, their assessments of symptoms and quality of life, and investigator's assessment on efficacy of treatment. Safety assessments included adverse events, laboratory values, and cardiovascular events. Key Results Efficacy and safety were evaluated for 501 patients who received study drug. On the primary endpoint, prucalopride was significantly more effective than placebo with 83 (33.3%) vs 26 (10.3%) patients having a weekly average of ≥3 SCBMs during the 12-week treatment (P <0.001). Respective percentages were 34.5%vs 11.1% over first 4weeks (P <0.001). On other secondary endpoints, clinical improvement was generally larger and statistically superior (P <0.001) in the prucalopride group. Most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and headache. Conclusion & Inferences Prucalopride 2mg given once-daily significantly improved bowel function, associated symptoms, and satisfaction in CC over a 12-week treatment period, and was safe and well tolerated by patients in the Asia-Pacific region. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84870055945	Characterization of temperature-sensitive mutants reveals a role for receptor-like kinase SCRAMBLED/STRUBBELIG in coordinating cell proliferation and differentiation during Arabidopsis leaf development	The balance between cell proliferation and cell differentiation is essential for leaf patterning. However, identification of the factors coordinating leaf patterning and cell growth behavior is challenging. Here, we characterized a temperature-sensitive Arabidopsis mutant with leaf blade and venation defects. We mapped the mutation to the sub-2 allele of the SCRAMBLED/STRUBBELIG (SCM/SUB) receptor-like kinase gene whose functions in leaf development have not been demonstrated. The sub-2 mutant displayed impaired blade development, asymmetric leaf shape and altered venation patterning under high ambient temperature (30°C), but these defects were less pronounced at normal growth temperature (22°C). Loss of SCM/SUB function results in reduced cell proliferation and abnormal cell expansion, as well as altered auxin patterning. SCM/SUB is initially expressed throughout leaf primordia and becomes restricted to the vascular cells, coinciding with its roles in early leaf patterning and venation formation. Furthermore, constitutive expression of the SCM/SUB gene also restricts organ growth by inhibiting the transition from cell proliferation to expansion. We propose the existence of a SCM/SUB-mediated developmental stage-specific signal for leaf patterning, and highlight the importance of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation for leaf morphogenesis. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

84871782429	Preventive effect of phycocyanin from Spirulina platensis on alloxan-injured mice	The preventive effect of phycocyanin (obtained from Spirulina platensis) on alloxan-injured mice is investigated. Oral administration of phycocyanin was started two weeks before an alloxan injury and continued until four weeks later. Tests resulted in the following positive results of oral phycocyanin administration on alloxan-injured mice: decrease fasting blood glucose and glycosylated serum protein (GSP); maintain total antioxidative capability (T-AOC); avert malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in the liver, kidney, and pancreas; decrease total cholesterol (TC) level and triglycerides (TG) level in serum and liver; increase the levels of hepatic glycogen level; maintain glucokinase (GK) expression in the liver and decrease p53 expression in the pancreas at mRNA level. The histological observations also supported the above results. Acute toxicity study further shows that phycocyanin is relatively safe. These results led to the conclusion that phycocyanin has significant preventive effect on alloxan-injured mice. The inhibition of p53 pathway could be one of the mechanisms that led to the protection of pancreatic islets from alloxan injury. We also proposed that GK expression that functions to promote liver glycogen synthesis could be the reason for reduced blood glucose level. The encouraging results are the first step in studying the potential of phycocyanin as a clinical measure in preventing diabetes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84871440686	Insulin-like growth factor 1 regulates expression of stem cell factor through ERKMAPK signaling pathway in gastric smooth muscle cell	Objective: To explore the effect and the intracellular signal transduction pathway of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) on the expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in gastric smooth muscle cells (SMC). Methods: Gastric SMC from SD rats were cultured by enzymolysis and identified by α-actin immunofluorescence methods. Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to examine the expression of SCF in gastric SMC: (1) The level of SCF after gastric SMC were cultured with IGF-1. (2) The level of SCF after IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1Rα) monoclonal antibody were added. (3) Another SMC were pretreated with specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor LY-294002, and investigate expression of SCF in gastric SMC. Results: A very low level of SCF was expressed in gastric SMC cultured in bovine serum free medium. A low concentration of IGF-1 (5 and 10 (μg/L) had no effect on the expression of SCF (both P > 0.05), but the expressions of SCF mRNA and protein increased in IGF-1 at a higher concentration (50, 100 and 150 μg/L) (2.79, 5.51 and 5.35-fold in protein respectively, 1.81, 2.54 and 2.38-fold in mRNA respectively, all P < 0.05), and IGF-1 in 100 μg/L may be the effective final concentration (all P < 0.05). The peak of SCF increment was at the 16th hour with IGF-1 (2.36-fold in protein, 5.51-fold in mRNA, all P < 0.05). The expression of SCF could be inhibited by IGF-1 receptor monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner (all P < 0.05). The IGF-1-induced SCF expression was reduced significantly by a pretreatment of PD-98059 (23% in protein and 48% in mRNA, P < 0.05). And LY-294002 had no effect on the expression of SCF (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The SCF expression in gastric SMC is stimulated by IGF-1 in both dose- and time-dependent manners through IGF-1R in which ERKMAPK signal transduction may play an important role.

84873124847	Role of glucagon-like peptide-1 in the pathogenesis of experimental irritable bowel syndrome rat models	Alterations in gut motility and visceral hypersensi-tivity are two major features of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in the pathogenesis of experimental IBS. Rat models of constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) were established. Fecal water content and behavioral responses to colorectal disten-tion (CRD), using electromyography (EMG), were measured. The expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in the colon was detected by immunohistochemistry, and the serum concentration of GLP-1 was measured by ELISA assay. The movement of circular and longitudinal colonic muscle was detected using an organ bath recording technique. Compared to controls, the fecal water contents were lower in the IBS-C group, while they were higher in the IBS-D group (P<0.05). EMG response to CRD in the experimental IBS groups was increased compared with their respective controls (P<0.05). GLP-1R was localized in the mucosa layer, circular muscle and myenteric nerve plexus of the colon. Notably, the expression of GLP-1R in the IBS-C group was higher, but in the IBS-D group, it was lower compared with controls. The serum levels of GLP-1 in the IBS-C group were higher compared to those in the IBS-D group (P<0.05). In addition, administration of exog-enous GLP-1 and exendin-4 inhibited colonic circular muscle contraction, particularly in the IBS-C group, while there was no significant effect on longitudinal muscle contraction. In conclusion, these results indicated that GLP-1 and GLP-1R are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS-C and IBS-D.

84875108330	Five-year follow-up of 263 cases of functional bowel disorder	AIM: To determine the mortality associated with functional bowel disorders (FBDs) and their possible relationship with organic bowel disease. METHODS: Patients who satisfied the Rome III criteria for FBD (retrospective diagnosis) were followed up by telephone interview and/or outpatient review at 5 years after their first attendance. The patients were divided into the following groups: irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, functional diarrhea and unspecified FBD. The survival of the FBD patients overall and of those with each FBD were compared with data obtained from the Guangzhou population in 2005. The incidences of colonic cancer overall and for each FBD were compared with data from the Chinese population obtained from 56 cancer registries in 19 provinces of the country in 2008. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-three patients were followed-up. Five patients died, which was not significantly different from the expected survival rate. No differences in mortality among the FBDs were found. There were nine cases of organic bowel disease: three colonic cancers and six colonic polyps. The incidence of colonic cancer in FBD patients was higher than that in the general Chinese population (0.23% vs 0.03%, P < 0.05). There were significant differences in the incidence of colonic cancer among the FBDs (0/134, 0/24, 2/29, 1/66, 0/10, respectively, P < 0.05); functional constipation was the most common. The incidence of colonic polyps was similar among the FBDs. The baseline age of patients who died was greater than that of those who survived (66.60 ± 6.84 years vs 45.14 ± 10.34 years, P < 0.05). The baseline age of patients who had colonic cancer or polyps during follow-up was greater than that of those without colonic cancer or polyps (60.33 ± 1.53 years vs 45.38 ± 10.62 years; 54.50 ± 6.47 years vs 45.34 ± 10.68 years, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: FBDs do not increase the risk of death. The incidence of colonic cancer in patients with FBDs may be increased, especially in those with func onal constipation and in the elderly. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84878570568	Effect of endogenous insulin-like growth factor and stem cell factor on diabetic colonic dysmotility	AIM: To investigate whether the reduction of stem cell factor (SCF) is mediated by decreased endogenous insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 in diabetic rat colon smooth muscle. METHODS: Sixteen Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group and streptozotocin-induced diabetic group. After 8 wk of streptozotocin administration, colonic motility function and contractility of circular muscle strips were measured. The expression of endogenous IGF-1 and SCF was tested in colonic tissues. Colonic smooth muscle cells were cultured from normal adult rats. IGF-1 siRNA transfection was used to investigate whether SCF expression was affected by endogenous IGF-1 expression in smooth muscle cells, and IGF-1 induced SCF expression effects were studied. The effect of high glucose on the expression of endogenous IGF-1 and SCF was also investigated. RESULTS: Diabetic rats showed prolonged colonic transit time (252 ± 16 min vs 168 ± 9 min, P < 0.01) and weakness of circular muscle contraction (0.81 ± 0.09 g vs 2.48 ± 0.23 g, P < 0.01) compared with the control group. Endogenous IGF-1 and SCF protein expression was significantly reduced in the diabetic colonic muscle tissues. IGF-1 and SCF mRNA expression also showed a paralleled reduction in diabetic rats. In the IGF-1 siRNA transfected smooth muscle cells, SCF mRNA and protein expression was significantly decreased. IGF-1 could induce SCF expression in a concentration and time-dependent manner, mainly through the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signal pathway. High glucose inhibited endogenous IGF-1 and SCF expression and the addition of IGF-1 to the medium reversed the SCF expression. CONCLUSION: Myopathy may resolve in colonic motility dysfunction in diabetic rats. Deficiency of endogenous IGF-1 in colonic smooth muscle cells leads to reduction of SCF expression. © 2013 Baishideng.

84878461270	Warm temperatures induce transgenerational epigenetic release of RNA silencing by inhibiting siRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis	Owing to their sessile nature, plants have evolved sophisticated genetic and epigenetic regulatory systems to respond quickly and reversibly to daily and seasonal temperature changes. However, our knowledge of how plants sense and respond to warming ambient temperatures is rather limited. Here we show that an increase in growth temperature from 22 °C to 30 °C effectively inhibited transgene-induced posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, warmth-induced PTGS release exhibited transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. We discovered that the warmth-induced PTGS release occurred during a critical step that leads to the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) for producing small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Deep sequencing of small RNAs and RNA blot analysis indicated that the 22-30 °C increase resulted in a significant reduction in the abundance of many trans-acting siRNAs that require dsRNA for biogenesis. We discovered that the temperature increase reduced the protein abundance of SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3, as a consequence, attenuating the formation of stable dsRNAs required for siRNA biogenesis. Importantly, SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 overexpression released the warmth-triggered inhibition of siRNA biogenesis and reduced the transgenerational epigeneticmemory. Thus, our study reveals a previously undescribed association between warming temperatures, an epigenetic system, and siRNA biogenesis.

84879047536	Role of nesfatin-1 in a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity	AIM: To explore the role of nesfatin-1 on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like visceral hypersensitivity. METHODS: The animal model of IBS-like visceral hypersensitivity was induced by intracolonic infusion of 0.5% acetic acid (AA) in saline once daily from postnatal days 8-21. Experiments were performed when rats became adults. The visceral sensitivity of rats was evaluated by abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and electromyographic (EMG) activity of the external oblique muscle to graded colorectal distension. The content of nesfatin-1 in serum was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. After implantation of an intracerebroventricular (ICV) cannula and two electrodes into the external oblique muscle, model rats were randomly divided into four groups. Animals then received ICV injection of 8 μg of anti-nesfatin-1/ nucleobindin-2 (NUCB2), 50 μg of α-helical cortico tropin releasing factor (CRF) 9-41 (non-selective CRF receptor antagonist), 50 μg of NBI-27914 (selective CRF1 receptor antagonist) or 5 μL of vehicle. After 1 h of ICV administration, visceral sensitivity of each group was measured again, and comparisons between groups were made. RESULTS: Rats treated with AA showed higher mean AWR scores and EMG activity at all distension pressures compared with controls (P < 0.05). On histopathologic examination, no evidence of inflammation or abnormalities in structure were noted in the colon of either control or AA-treated groups. Myeloperoxidase values were not significantly different between the two groups. The level of nesfatin-1 in serum was significantly higher in the AA-treated group than in the control group (5.34 ± 0.37 ng/mL vs 4.81 ± 0.42 ng/mL, P < 0.01). Compared with rats injected with vehicle, rats which received ICV anti-nesfatin-1/NUCB2, α-helical CRF9-41 or NBI-27914 showed decreased mean AWR scores and EMG activity at all distension pressures (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Nesfatin-1 may be associated with IBS-like visceral hypersensitivity, which may be implicated in brain CRF/CRF1 signaling pathways. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84884184106	Age-related symptom and life quality changes in women with irritable bowel syndrome	AIM: To explore age-related changes in symptoms and quality of life (QoL) of women with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: Two-hundred and fifty-four female adult outpatients with IBS attending the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between January, 2008 and October, 2008 were approached. Patients with a history of abdominal surgery, mental illness or those who had recently taken psychotropic drugs were excluded. A physician obtained demographic and abdominal symptom data. All patients were asked to complete the Zung Self-Rated Anxiety and Depression Scale (SDS/SAS) and the IBS-specific QoL questionnaire. The patients were divided into six groups according to age, in 10-year increments: 18-27 years, 28-37 years, 38-47 years, 48-57 years, 58-67 years and 68-75 years (maximum 75 years). Age-related differences of abdominal pain or discomfort were analyzed using ranksum tests. Differences in SDS/SAS and IBS-QoL scores between age groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations evaluated potential associations between IBS symptoms, psychological factors and QoL in each age group. RESULTS: There were no differences in the distribution of IBS subtypes between age groups (χ

84885581758	Treatment choice for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients who had gradual progression after EGFR-TKIs: 32 cases report	Background and objective The epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFRTKIs) have been widely used in the treatment of the advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially in the adenocarcinoma patients with activating EGFR mutations. But there is no published overview of the following treatment. This report through observing the efficacy, toxicity and overall survival of different treatments to the advanced NSCLC patients who had gradual progression after EGFR-TKIs, evaluates the influence of the continued treatment and switching chemotherapy. Methods Retrospective review is conducted on 32 cases of advanced NSCLC patients who experienced treatment failure of EGFR-TKIs. One group accepted the continued treatment and the other group accepted the switching chemotherapy. Results The median overall survival of the continued treatment group is 36.0 months. The respose rate of the switching chemotherapy group is 43.75%, and clinical benefit rate (complete and partial response and stable disease) is 87.5%. The median overall survival is 15.5 months. The main toxicities are nausea, vomiting and hematological toxicities. Conclusion For the advanced NSCLC patients who had gradual progression after EGFR-TKIs, the continued treatment is one of the acceptable choices.

84892543532	Gastroesophageal reflux disease related dilated intercellular spaces and tight junction proteins	Lowering of defense capability of esophageal mucosa plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The defense function of esophageal mucosa is mainly completed by epithelial barrier, including epithelial cell membrane and tight junction (TJ). Studies have found that abnormal expression and distribution of esophageal epithelium TJ proteins may cause dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) in GERD patients. DIS may be served as an objective indicator of abnormal morphological structure of GERD esophagus. Therefore, investigating the correlation between TJ proteins, DIS and GERD has important clinical significance. It may provide a new direction for diagnosis and treatment of GERD, even for evaluation of therapeutic effect.

84892743388	Strong asymmetrical bias dependence of magnetoresistance in organic spin valves: The role of ferromagnetic/organic interfaces	We report a highly asymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) bias dependence, with the inverse MR peaking at a negative bias and a sign reversal occurring at a positive bias in prototypical La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/Alq3/Co organic spin valve (OSV) with a tunnel barrier between LSMO and Alq3. This behavior is in strong contrast with the commonly found inverse MR in entire bias range for LSMO/Alq3/Co OSVs. The MR bias voltage dependence is independent on the type of the tunnel barrier, either SrTiO3 or Al2O3. Together with first-principle calculations, we demonstrate that the strongly hybridized Co d-states with Alq3 molecules at the interface are responsible for the efficient d-states spin injection and the observed MR bias dependence is originated from the energy dependent density of states of Co d-states. These findings open up new possibilities to engineer interfacial bonding between ferromagnetic materials and a wide variety of molecule selections for the desired spin transport properties. © 2014 IOP Publishing and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.

84893867043	Experimental observation of ferrielectricity in multiferroic DyMn 2 O 5	One of the major breakthroughs associated with multiferroicity in recent years is the discovery of ferroelectricity generated by specific magnetic structures in some magnetic insulating oxides such as rare-earth manganites RMnO 3 and RMn 2 O 5. An unresolved issue is the small electric polarization. Relatively large electric polarization and strong magnetoelectric coupling have been found in those manganites of double magnetic ions: magnetic rare-earth R ion and Mn ion, due to the strong R-Mn (4f-3d) interactions. DyMn 2 O 5 is a representative example. We unveil in this work the ferrielectric nature of DyMn 2 O 5, in which the two ferroelectric sublattices with opposite electric polarizations constitute the ferrielectric state. One sublattice has its polarization generated by the symmetric exchange striction from the Mn-Mn interactions, while the polarization of the other sublattice is attributed to the symmetric exchange striction from the Dy-Mn interactions. We present detailed measurements on the electric polarization as a function of temperature, magnetic field, and measuring paths. The present experiments may be helpful for clarifying the puzzling issues on the multiferroicity in DyMn 2 O 5 and other RMn 2 O 5 multiferroics.

84895075364	MicroRNA expression aberration in chinese patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease that is caused by an abnormal immune system that attacks the central nervous system. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play essential roles in the immune system. Most of the previous studies about miRNA dysregulation in MS have focused on European populations. In the present study, the miRNA expression profiles associated with Chinese MS patients are investigated. Here, human miRNA expression profiling experiments were performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes from ten MS patients and ten healthy controls. Nine overexpressed and six underexpressed miRNAs were found. The 15 miRNAs were validated independently in a second cohort of 40 MS patients and 40 controls by real-time PCR; six miRNAs were significantly abnormally expressed, and principal component analysis of six miRNAs indicated that the MS patients could be clearly differentiated from the healthy controls based on the miRNA expression patterns. This study provided the indications of abnormal miRNA expression patterns in the peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes of Chinese MS patients. The potential roles of these differentially expressed miRNAs as MS biomarker and in pathogenesis need to be investigated in future studies. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84898912521	Accuracy of diagnosing gastroesophageal reflux disease by GerdQ, esophageal impedance monitoring and histology	Objective: To assess the performance of self-assessment gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire (GerdQ), 24-h impedance monitoring, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) test and intercellular space of esophageal mucosal epithelial cells in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Methods: Patients with symptoms suspected of GERD were administered the GerdQ and underwent endoscopy (measurement of intercellular space in the biopsy specimen sampling at 2cm above the Z-line) and 24-h impedance pH monitoring, together with a 2-week experimental treatment with esomeprazole. Results: A total of 636 patients were included for the final analysis, including 352 with GERD. The sensitivity and specificity of GerdQ and 24-h impedance monitoring for diagnosing GERD were 57.7% and 48.9%, and 66.4% and 43.3%, respectively. The sensitivity of 24-h impedance pH monitoring increased to 93.7%. The sensitivity and specificity of dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) (≥0.9 μm) for diagnosing GERD were 61.2% and 56.1%, respectively, whereas those for PPI test were 70.5% and 44.4%. Conclusions: GerdQ score or PPI test alone cannot accurately diagnose GERD in a Chinese population suspected of GERD. A definitive diagnosis of GERD still depends on endoscopy or 24-h pH monitoring. 24-h impedance pH monitoring may increase the sensitivity for diagnosing GERD by 20%; however, when used alone, it results in poor specificity in patients without acid suppressive therapy. © 2014 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

84899639543	Resveratrol inhibits collagen I synthesis by suppressing IGF-1R activation in intestinal fibroblasts	AIM: To investigate whether resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy- trans-stilbene) inhibits collagen I synthesis induced by insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in intestinal fibroblasts, and to explore the possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a control group and a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis group. After 21 d of TNBS administration, the degree of inflammation and fibrosis in colon was measured by HE staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Western blotting was used to examine collagen I, IGF-1 and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) protein expression in colitis tissues. Western blotting and quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction were used to characterize collagen I protein and col1a2 mRNA expression in mouse intestinal fibroblasts and CCD-18Co cells treated with IGF-1. A MEK inhibitor (U0126) was used to determine whether IGF-1-induced collagen I expression was mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent mechanism. Effects of resveratrol on collagen I protein level, insulin growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels were also examined after IGF-1 treatment in fibroblasts. To evaluate whether SIRT1 was necessary for the anti-fibrosis effect of resveratrol, cells were transfected with SIRT1-specific small interfering RNAs, wildtype SIRT1, and deacetylase-inactive mutant SIRT1. RESULTS: Collagen I and IGF-1 expression was increased, and SIRT1 expression was decreased (0.67 ± 0.04 vs 1.05 ± 0.07, P < 0.001) in TNBS-induced colitis compared with the control group. In vitro, IGF-1 could induce collagen I expression, mainly through the ERK 1/2 signal pathway. Resveratrol reduced basal and IGF- 1-induced collagen I gene and protein expression in intestinal fibroblasts. Overexpression of wild-type SIRT1, not deacetylase-inactive mutant SIRT1, decreased expression of collagen I induced by IGF-1. Moreover, silencing SIRT1 restored collagen I expression in fibroblasts challenged with resveratrol. However, disruption of SIRT1 did not influence the anti-fibrotic effects of resveratrol and IGF-1-induced collagen I expression. Further analysis revealed that resveratrol significantly decreased phosphorylation of IGF-1R and its downstream signaling molecules by inhibiting IGF-1 binding to its receptor. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that resveratrol effectively inhibits collagen I synthesis in IGF-1-stimulated fibroblasts, partly by inhibiting IGF-1R activation, and SIRT1 is also responsible for the process. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

84902491691	Effect of advanced glycation end products on myosin light chain kinase expression in smooth muscle cells and colonic motility dysfunction in diabetic rats	AIM: To investigate whether advanced glycation end products (AGEs) affect colonic motility and the expression of myosin light chain kinase in diabetic rats. METHODS: Forty-eight SD rats were evenly and randomly divided into four groups: normal controls, normal rats treated with aminoguanidine (AG, an inhibitor of AGEs), diabetic rats, and diabetic rats treated with AG. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg). AG was given in drinking water at a dose of 1 g/L after DM was induced. ELISA and Western blot were used to measure levels of AGEs in serum and the colonic muscle layer, respectively. Colon transit time was measured by plastic bead expulsion test, and the contractility of circular smooth muscle strips was tested using the MPA analysis system. The protein expression level of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) was determined by Western blot. RESULTS: Compared with the normal control group, the expression levels of AGEs in the colonic muscle layer and serum (3.00 μg/mL ± 0.34 μg/mL vs 4.31 μg/mL ± 0.73 μg/mL, P < 0.01) were increased, colon transit time was delayed (209.50 min ± 48.88 min vs 297.00 min ± 35.71 min, P < 0.01), the contractility of circular smooth muscle strips was weakened (2.17 g ± 0.57 g vs 0.80 g ± 0.34 g, P < 0.01), and the expression of MLCK in the colonic muscle layer was lower (1.46 ± 0.11 vs 1.01 ± 0.08, P < 0.01) in the diabetic group. There was no significant change in blood glucose levels in rats treated with AG. Compared with the diabetic group, DM rats treated with AG showed decreased levels of AGEs in the colon muscle layer and serum (4.31 μg/mL ± 0.73 μg/mL vs 3.35 μg/mL ± 0.58 μg/mL, P < 0.05), shortened colon transit time (297.00 min ± 35.71 min vs 212.13 min ± 42.95 min, P < 0.01), enhanced contractility of circular smooth muscle strips (0.80 g ± 0.34 g vs 1.49 g ± 0.44 g, P < 0.01), and higher expression of MLCK in the colonic muscle layer (1.01 ± 0.08 vs 1.40 ± 0.09, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: AGEs might be involved in the pathogenesis of colonic motility dysfunction in diabetic rats via decreasing the expression of MLCK. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

84902511681	Exendin-4, an analogue of Glucagon-like peptide-1, attenuates hyperalgesia through serotonergic pathways in rats with neonatal colonic sensitivity	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue ROSE-010 can provide effective pain relief from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the underlying biological mechanism is still unknown. Here, we investigate the effect of GLP-1 analogue exendin-4 on visceral hypersensitivity in colonic sensitized rats. Rat models of visceral hypersensitivity were established by intra-colonic infusion of acetic acid in 10-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Visceral sensitivity was assessed by measurement of abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) and electromyography (EMG). Exendin-4 with doses of 1, 5, and 10 ∞g/kg were intraperitoneally administered, respectively. The expressions of serotonin transporter (SERT) and tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH-1) in colonic tissues were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. The levels of serotonin (5-HT) and GLP-1 were measured by ELISA assay. Visceral hypersensitivity after neonatal colonic sensitization was verified. The colonic sensitized rats showed low levels of GLP-1 in plasma and high levels of 5-HT in plasma and colonic tissue (P<0.05). Exendin-4 dose-dependently reduced visceral hypersensitivity in colonic sensitized rats. The AWR scores in colonic sensitized rats with exendin-4 (5 ∞g/kg) reduced to 1.56±0.53 (P=0.013 vs. 2.33±0.50), 2.23±0.45 (P=0.008 vs. 3.0±0.5) during CRD at 40, and 60 mmHg, respectively. Similar findings were showed at dose of 10 ∞g/kg. Exendin-4 (5 ∞g/kg and 10 ∞g/kg) reduced the EMG during CRD at 40, 60, 80 mmHg (P<0.01). Exendin-4 (5.0 ∞g/kg or 10.0 ∞g/kg) significantly decreased the 5-HT colonic levels (2.343±0.447, 2.175±0.360 ng/100 mg vs. 3.607±0.628 ng/100 mg, P<0.05). The SERT protein expressions in colonic tissues in colonic sensitized rats were significantly increased with exendin-4 at doses of 1, 5 or 10 ug/kg (0.759±0.068, 0.942±0.037, 0.944±0.097 vs. 0.552±0.047, P<0.05, respectively), and the SERT mRNA expression also increased after treatment with exendin-4. The colonic sensitized rats showed lower TPH-1 levels after treatment with exendin-4 (P<0.05). These findings suggest that exendin-4 reduce visceral hypersensitivity and this may be associated with up-regulating SERT expression, and down-regulating TPH-1 expression.

84904157251	Analysis of relationship between the UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and toxicity as well as efficacy in patients with small cell lung cancer treated with irinotecan	OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and toxicity as well as efficacy in 48 patients with small cell lung cancer initially treated with irinotecan combined with cis-platinum regimen as first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with previously-untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer were treated with irinotecan plus cis-platinum regimen. The relationships between the UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and toxicity as well as efficacy were analyzed. RESULTS: The main side effects were 34 cases with neutropenia, 29 case with anemia, 14 cases with thrombocytopenia, 38 cases with nausea and vomiting, 26 cases with delayed diarrhea, 15 cases with constipation, 5 cases with hair loss, 38 cases with fatigue, 14 cases with transaminase elevation and 9 cases with abnormal ECG. The distribution of UGT1A1*28 gene polymorphisms were as follws: 34 cases with TA6/6 gene type, 11 cases with TA6/7 gene type and 3 cases with TA7/7 gene type. The distribution of UGT1A1*6 gene polymorphisms were 33 cases with G/G gene type, 13 cases with A/G gene type and 2 cases with A/A gene type. There was no significant relationship between UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and clinical efficacy. Mutant-type of UGT1A1 may increase the risk of delayed diarrhea and had no influence on neutropenia. The result of multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the delayed diarrhea was related with UGT1A1*28, UGT1A1*6, ECOG and times of treatment cycles were influential on delayed diarrhea, and ECOG and times of treatment cycles were influential on neutropenia. CONCLUSIONS: Mutant-type of UGT1A1 was influential on delayed diarrhea. It is helpful to forecast adverse effect after using irinotecan and important for clinical medication safety.

84904872415	ERK1/2 participates in regulating the expression and distribution of tight junction proteins in the process of reflux esophagitis	To investigate the alterations of esophageal epithelial barrier during the process of reflux esophagitis (RE). Methods: In total, 85 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups, the sham-operation group (n=25) and the RE group induced by incomplete pyloric ligation (n=60). The establishment of RE model and the severity of esophagitis were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin stain. Dilated intercellular spaces (DIS) in the esophageal epithelium were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The cellular distributions of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 were assessed by immunohistochemical stain. The expressions of these tight junction (TJ) proteins and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), myosin light chain (MLC) and nonmuscular myosin light chain kinase (nmMLCK) were analyzed by Western blot. Results: DIS occurred gradually in the RE group. ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 were incompletely or even not expressed in the RE group. TJ proteins were expressed in the membrane instead of the cytoplasm in many epithelial cells in RE. With Western, the expression of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 was increased gradually in the RE group (P<0.05). The phosphorylation levels of nmMLCK, MLC and ERK1/2 were also increased (P<0.05). There was no marked changes in the esophageal epithelium in the sham-operation group. Conclusions: TJ proteins could be used as sensitive markers of RE instead of DIS. ERK1/2 may participate in regulating TJ proteins in esophageal epithelia in RE. © 2014 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch.

84905083189	Effects of advanced glycation end products and phosphorylated myosin light chain on diabetic colonic dysmotility	Background: Colonic dysmotility is a common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is significantly increased in patients with DM, however, its effect on diabetic colonic dysmotility has not yet been fully clarified. Aims: To investigate the effects of AGEs and phosphorylated myosin light chain (p-MLC) on diabetic colonic dysmotility. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into DM group and normal control group. DM model was established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Rat were sacrificed 8 weeks later and specimens of distal colon were obtained. The contraction ability of colonic smooth muscle was assessed, and expression of p-MLC in colonic tissue was determined by immunohistochemistry; expressions of p-MLC and total myosin light chain (t-MLC) were determined by Western blotting. Colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated and treated with different concentrations and different time durations of AGEs. Expressions of p-MLC and t-MLC in SMCs were determined by Western blotting.Results: Muscle tonus of colonic smooth muscle was significantly weaker in DM group than that in normal control group [(0.89±0.09) g vs. (1.98±0.12) g, P<0.05]. Expression of p-MLC/t-MLC/β-actin was significantly decreased in colonic tissue in DM group than that in normal control group (0.98±0.10 vs.1.61±0.12, P<0.05). Expression of p-MLC/t-MLC/β-actin was significantly decreased in SMCs treated with different concentrations and different time durations of AGEs. Conclusions: AGEs can inhibit phosphorylation of MLC in SMCs, which may lead to colonic dysmotility in DM.

84910007034	Epidermal growth factor upregulates serotonin transporter and its association with visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome	AIM: To investigate the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in visceral hypersensitivity and its effect on the serotonin transporter (SERT). METHODS: A rat model for visceral hypersensitivity was established by intra-colonic infusion of 0.5% acetic acid in 10-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The visceral sensitivity was assessed by observing the abdominal withdrawal reflex and recording electromyographic activity of the external oblique muscle in response to colorectal distension. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the EGF levels in plasma and colonic tissues. SERT mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR while protein level was determined by Western blot. The correlation between EGF and SERT levels in colon tissues was analyzed by Pearson's correlation analysis. SERT function was examined by tritiated serotonin (5-HT) uptake experiments. Rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were used to examine the EGF regulatory effect on SERT expression and function via the EGF receptor (EGFR). RESULTS: EGF levels were significantly lower in the rats with visceral hypersensitivity as measured in plasma (2.639 ± 0.107 ng/mL vs 4.066 ± 0.573 ng/mL, P < 0.01) and in colonic tissue (3.244 ± 0.135 ng/100 mg vs 3.582 ± 0.197 ng/100 mg colon tissue, P < 0.01) compared with controls. Moreover, the EGF levels were positively correlated with SERT levels (r = 0.820, P < 0.01). EGF displayed dose- and time-dependent increased SERT gene expressions in IEC-6 cells. An EGFR kinase inhibitor inhibited the effect of EGF on SERT gene upregulation. SERT activity was enhanced following treatment with EGF (592.908 ± 31.515 fmol/min per milligram vs 316.789 ± 85.652 fmol/min per milligram protein, P < 0.05) and blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor in IEC-6 cells (590.274 ± 25.954 fmol/min per milligram vs 367.834 ± 120.307 fmol/min per milligram protein, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A decrease in EGF levels may contribute to the formation of visceral hypersensitivity through downregulation of SERT-mediated 5-HT uptake into enterocytes.

84911440512	An alternative to current therapies of functional dyspepsia: Self-administrated transcutaneous electroacupuncture improves dyspeptic symptoms	Functional dyspepsia is of high prevalence with little treatment options. The aim of this study was to develop a new treatment method using self-management transcutaneous electroacupuncture (TEA) for functional dyspepsia (FD). Twenty-eight patients with FD were enrolled and underwent a crossover clinical trial with 2-week TEA at ST36 and PC6 and 2-week sham-TEA at nonacupuncture sham-points. Questionnaires were used to assess symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life. Physiological testing included gastric emptying and electrogastrography. It was found that (1) TEA but not sham-TEA significantly improved dyspeptic symptoms and 4 domains in quality of life; improvement was also noted in self-rated anxiety and depression scores; (2) gastric emptying was significantly and substantially increased with 2-week TEA but not sham-TEA; and (3) gastric accommodation was also improved with TEA but not sham-TEA, reflected as increased ingested nutrient volumes at the levels of satiety and maximum tolerance. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential of self-administrated TEA method for functional dyspepsia, possibly attributed to improvement in gastric motility.

84920869403	Melatonin protects the esophageal epithelial barrier by suppressing the transcription, expression and activity of myosin light chain kinase through ERK1/2 signal transduction	Background/Aims: Dilated intercellular space (DIS) contributes to the pathophysiology of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Melatonin protects the esophageal mucosa; however, the mechanisms underlying that protection remain unclear. Methods: Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the intercellular spaces in the esophageal epithelium of GERD patients. The Het-1A monolayer barrier function was investigated by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran paracellular permeation. The activity of MLCK was represented by MLC phosphorylation. The expression and phosphorylation of MLCK, MLC and ERK were examined by western blot analysis. Results: The expression and activity of MLCK and ERK phosphorylation were increased in the esophageal epithelium. The increased expression and activity of MLCK was correlated with dilated intercellular spaces. Upon acid treatment, the Het-1A monolayer permeability was increased. When the Het-1A monolayer was pretreated with melatonin and PD98059 before the acid incubation, the permeability and the expression and phosphorylation of MLCK and ERK decreased. Conclusion: Melatonin protects the esophageal epithelial barrier by suppressing the transcription, translation and activity of MLCK through ERK1/2 signal transduction. These findings provide a better understanding of the potential clinical application of melatonin in GERD treatment.

84925235107	Expression of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in diabetic colon muscle	Background: The mechanism of diabetic gastrointestinal dysmotility is still unclear. More and more studies showed that gastrointestinal smooth muscle derived factors play an important role in gastrointestinal dysmotility. Recently, the role of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in diabetic complications become a research hotspot. Aims: To investigate the possible role of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in diabetic colon dysmotility by examining the expressions of major signaling molecules in diabetic colon muscle. Methods: Normal colon tissue samples taken from patients undergoing radical surgery for colonic cancer from Sept. 2012 to Dec. 2013 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University were collected. According to glycated hemoglobin level, the patients were divided into diabetes mellitus (DM) group and control group. The expressions of major signaling molecules in RhoA/ROCK1 signaling pathway including RhoA, ROCK1, MYPT1 and p-MYPT1 were determined by immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. Results: Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of RhoA protein in DM group was significantly lower than that in control group (P<0.05). Western blotting showed that expression levels of RhoA, ROCK1 and p-MYPT1 proteins were significantly lower in DM group than in control group (0.62±0.42 vs. 1.15±0.69, 0.54±0.09 vs. 0.75±0.05, 0.70±0.28 vs. 1.04±0.47; P<0.05), whereas no significant difference in expression level of MYPT1 protein was found between DM group and control group (0.94±0.50 vs. 1.21±0.80, P>0.05). Conclusions: The inhibition of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in diabetic colon muscle may have some correlation with diabetic colon dysmotility.
