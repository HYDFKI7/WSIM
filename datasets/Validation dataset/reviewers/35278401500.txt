Conventional approaches select B meson decay products that are significantly displaced from the B meson production vertex. As a consequence, B mesons with low decay times are suppressed, introducing a bias to the decay time spectrum which must be corrected. This analysis uses a technique that explicitly avoids a lifetime bias by using a neural network based trigger and event selection. Using 1.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of data recorded by the LHCb experiment, the effective B<inf>s</inf><sup>0</sup>→K<sup>+</sup>K<sup>-</sup> lifetime is measured as 1.455±0.046(stat.)±0.006(syst.)ps. © 2012 CERN.

84937644674	Implications of LHCb measurements and future prospects	During 2011 the LHCb experiment at CERN collected 1.0 fb<sup>-1</sup> of √s = 7 TeV pp collisions. Due to the large heavy quark production cross-sections, these data provide unprecedented samples of heavy flavoured hadrons. The first results from LHCb have made a significant impact on the flavour physics landscape and have definitively proved the concept of a dedicated experiment in the forward region at a hadron collider. This document discusses the implications of these first measurements on classes of extensions to the Standard Model, bearing in mind the interplay with the results of searches for on-shell production of new particles at ATLAS and CMS. The physics potential of an upgrade to the LHCb detector, which would allow an order of magnitude more data to be collected, is emphasised. © 2013 CERN for the benefit of the LHCb collaboration.

84940890168	Measurement of charged particle multiplicities in pp collisions at √s = 7 TeV in the forward region	Charged particle production in proton-proton collisions is studied with the LHCb detector at a centre-of-mass energy of √s = 7 TeV in different intervals of pseudorapidity η. Charged particles are reconstructed close to the interaction region in the vertex detector, which provides high reconstruction efficiency in the η ranges −2.5 < η <−2.0 and 2.0 < η < 4.5. The data were taken with a minimum bias trigger, only requiring one or more reconstructed tracks in the vertex detector. By selecting an event sample with at least one track with a transverse momentum greater than 1 GeV/c a hard QCD subsample is investigated. Several event generators are compared with the data; none are able to describe fully the multiplicity distributions or the charged particle density distribution as a function of η. In general, the models underestimate charged particle production.

The J/ψ mesons are reconstructed using the dimuon decay mode. The analysis is based on a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 1.6 nb<sup>−1</sup>. For the first time the nuclear modification factor and forward-backward production ratio are determined separately for prompt J/ψ mesons and J/ψ from b-hadron decays. Clear suppression of prompt J/ψ production with respect to proton-proton collisions at large rapidity is observed, while the production of J/ψ from b-hadron decays is less suppressed. These results show good agreement with available theoretical predictions. The measurement shows that cold nuclear matter effects are important for interpretations of the related quark-gluon plasma signatures in heavy-ion collisions.

84863116149	Absolute luminosity measurements with the LHCb detector at the LHC	Absolute luminosity measurements are of general interest for colliding-beam experiments at storage rings. These measurements are necessary to determine the absolute cross-sections of reaction processes and are valuable to quantify the performance of the accelerator. Using data taken in 2010, LHCb has applied two methods to determine the absolute scale of its luminosity measurements for proton-proton collisions at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. In addition to the classic ''van der Meer scan'' method a novel technique has been developed which makes use of direct imaging of the individual beams using beam-gas and beam-beam interactions. This beam imaging method is made possible by the high resolution of the LHCb vertex detector and the close proximity of the detector to the beams, and allows beam parameters such as positions, angles and widths to be determined. The results of the two methods have comparable precision and are in good agreement. Combining the two methods, an overal precision of 3.5% in the absolute luminosity determination is reached. The techniques used to transport the absolute luminosity calibration to the full 2010 data-taking period are presented. © 2012 CERN.

84896355777	Observation of B ̄ (s) 0 → J / ψ f 1 (1285) decays and measurement of the f 1 (1285) mixing angle	Decays of B̄s0 and B̄0 mesons into J/ψ π+π-π+π- final states, produced in pp collisions at the LHC, are investigated using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 fb-1 collected with the LHCb detector. B̄(s)0→J/ψf1(1285) decays are seen for the first time, and the branching fractions are measured. Using these rates, the f1(1285) mixing angle between strange and nonstrange components of its wave function in the qq̄ structure model is determined to be ±(24.0-2.6-0.8+3.1+0.6). Implications on the possible tetraquark nature of the f1(1285) are discussed. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84898076087	Search for Majorana neutrinos in B- →π+μ-μ- decays	A search for heavy Majorana neutrinos produced in the B-→π+μ- μ- decay mode is performed using 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected with the LHCb detector in pp collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV at the LHC. Neutrinos with masses in the range 250 to 5000 MeV and lifetimes from zero to 1000 ps are probed. In the absence of a signal, upper limits are set on the branching fraction B(B-→π+μ-μ-) as functions of neutrino mass and lifetime. These limits are on the order of 10-9 for short neutrino lifetimes of 1 ps or less. Limits are also set on the coupling between the muon and a possible fourth-generation neutrino. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb collaboration.

84899093120	Observation of photon polarization in the b →sγ transition	This Letter presents a study of the flavor-changing neutral current radiative B±→K±π-π±γ decays performed using data collected in proton-proton collisions with the LHCb detector at 7 and 8 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this sample, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb-1, nearly 14000 signal events are reconstructed and selected, containing all possible intermediate resonances with a K±π- π± final state in the [1.1,1.9]GeV/c2 mass range. The distribution of the angle of the photon direction with respect to the plane defined by the final-state hadrons in their rest frame is studied in intervals of K±π-π± mass and the asymmetry between the number of signal events found on each side of the plane is obtained. The first direct observation of the photon polarization in the b→sγ transition is reported with a significance of 5.2σ. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84900851668	Measurement of resonant and CP components in B ̄ s0 →j /ψπ+π- decays measurement of resonant and CP components ⋯ R. AAIJ et al.	Structure of the decay B̄s0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data corresponding to 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity from pp collisions produced by the LHC and collected by the LHCb detector. Five interfering π+π- states are required to describe the decay: f0(980),f0(1500),f0(1790),f2(1270), and f2′(1525). An alternative model including these states and a nonresonant J/ψπ+π- component also provides a good description of the data. Based on the different transversity components measured for the spin-2 intermediate states, the final state is found to be compatible with being entirely CP odd. The CP-even part is found to be <2.3% at a 95% confidence level. The f0(500) state is not observed, allowing a limit to be set on the absolute value of the mixing angle with the f0(980) of <7.7° at a 90% confidence level, consistent with a tetraquark interpretation of the f0(980) substructure. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84902199288	Observation of the resonant character of the Z (4430)-state	Resonant structures in B0 -K+ decays are analyzed by performing a four-dimensional fit of the decay amplitude, using pp collision data corresponding to 3fb-1 collected with the LHCb detector. The data cannot be described with K+Ï€- resonances alone, which is confirmed with a model-independent approach. A highly significant Z(4430)- Ïâ€ Ï€- component is required, thus confirming the existence of this state. The observed evolution of the Z(4430)- amplitude with the Ïâ€Ï€- mass establishes the resonant nature of this particle. The mass and width measurements are substantially improved. The spin parity is determined unambiguously to be 1+. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

84904307927	Measurement of the resonant and CP components in B ̄ 0 →j /ψπ+π- decays MEASUREMENT of the RESONANT and CP ⋯ R. AAIJ et al.	The resonant structure of the reaction B̄0→J/ψπ+π- is studied using data from 3fb-1 of integrated luminosity collected by the LHCb experiment, one third at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy and the remainder at 8 TeV. The invariant mass of the π+π- pair and three decay angular distributions are used to determine the fractions of the resonant and nonresonant components. Six interfering π+π- states, ρ(770), f0(500), f2(1270), ρ(1450), ω(782) and ρ(1700), are required to give a good description of invariant mass spectra and decay angular distributions. The positive and negative charge parity fractions of each of the resonant final states are determined. The f0(980) meson is not seen and the upper limit on its presence, compared with the observed f0(500) rate, is inconsistent with a model where these scalar mesons are formed from two quarks and two antiquarks (tetraquarks) at the eight standard deviation level. In the qq̄ model, the absolute value of the mixing angle between the f0(980) and the f0(500) scalar mesons is limited to be less than 17° at 90% confidence level. © 2014 CERN, for the LHCb collaboration.

84907358645	First measurement of the charge asymmetry in beauty-quark pair production	The difference in the angular distributions between beauty quarks and antiquarks, referred to as the charge asymmetry, is measured for the first time in bb̄ pair production at a hadron collider. The data used correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.0fb-1 collected at 7 TeV center-of-mass energy in proton-proton collisions with the LHCb detector. The measurement is performed in three regions of the invariant mass of the bb̄ system. The results obtained are ACbb̄(40<Mbb̄<75GeV/c2)=0.4±0.4±0.3%, ACbb̄(75<Mbb̄<105GeV/c2)=2.0±0.9±0.6%, ACbb̄(Mbb̄>105GeV/c2)=1.6±1.7±0.6%, where ACbb̄ is defined as the asymmetry in the difference in rapidity between jets formed from the beauty quark and antiquark, where in each case the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. The beauty jets are required to satisfy 2<η<4, ET>20GeV, and have an opening angle in the transverse plane Δφ>2.6rad. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of the standard model. © Published by the American Physical Society.

The angular distribution is described by two parameters, FH and the forward-backward asymmetry of the dimuon system A<sup>FB</sup>, which are determined in bins of the dimuon mass squared. The parameter F<inf>H</inf> is a measure of the contribution from (pseudo)scalar and tensor amplitudes to the decay width.
