84929398406	Numerical simulation of a spinning stabilized projectile aerodynamic characteristics effected by structure errors	Based on the (Shear Stress Transport) SST k-Ï‰ turbulent model, the effets of vehicle's model with structure errors are investigated using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. Firstly, the aerodynamic coefficients of the model without structure errors are calculated in the conditions of different Mach numbers and spinning speeds, and the results are compared with that of the experimental data. CFD calculations predicted the drag, normal force, pitching moment, and normal force center of pressure very well, and their errors are within 10% of the experimental data which verified the accuracy and feasibility of the CFD output. Then, the models without structure errors and the models with structure errors including projectile's mass asymmetry and coaxial error are established, and their aerodynamic characteristics are numerically calculated by CFD. The results shown that the model of mass asymmetry have a great influence on its roll damping coefficient and magnus moment coefficient derivative, and the model with coaxial error have a great influence on its normal force coefficient derivative, pitching moment coefficient derivative, magnus moment coefficient derivative and center of pressure location. Projectiles' aerodynamic characteristics coefficients may have a prodigious change due to structure errors, and the flight stability of the model may be effected by these coefficients' prodigious change. The flight trajectory and stability also will be affected accordingly.

In the approach to the problem, a nonuniform free-free Timoshenko and Euler-Bernoulli beamlike structure is modeled. A provision is made to take into consideration the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia. Large thrust-to-weight ratio leads to large axial accelerations that result in an axial inertia load distribution from nose to tail which causes the development of significant compressive forces along the length of the launch vehicle. Therefore, it is important to take into account this effect in the transverse vibration model. Once the transfer matrix of a single component has been obtained, the product of all component matrices composes the matrix of the entire structure. The frequency equation and mode shape are formulated in terms of the elements of the structural matrices. Flight test and analytical results validate the present TMM formulas. Â© 2013 Laith K.

The thermal effects are important since temperature environment influences significantly the static and dynamic behaviors of flight structures in supersonic/hypersonic regimes. The dynamic behavior of a double-wedge lifting surface with combined freeplay and cubic stiffening structural nonlinearities in both plunging and pitching degrees-of-freedom (DOF) operating in supersonic/hypersonic flight speed regimes has been analyzed. In addition a third order piston theory aerodynamics (PTA) is used to evaluate the non-linear unsteady aerodynamic loads applied to the wing section. Loss of torsional stiffness that may be incurred by lifting surfaces subjected to axial stresses induced by aerodynamic heating is also considered. The aerodynamic heating effect is estimated based on the adiabatic wall temperature due to high speed airstreams. It is demonstrated that serious losses of torsional stiffness may occur in such lifting surfaces; the influence of various parameters such as flight condition, thickness ratio, freeplays and pitching stiffness nonlinearity are discussed.

84855635287	Non-linear aero-thermo-visco-elastic behavior of geometrically imperfect curved skin panel: Flutter and post-flutter analysis	This paper deals with the aero-thermo-visco-elastic modeling and analyses of curved panels. Flutter and post-flutter behavior will be analyzed toward determining under which conditions such panels will exhibit a benign instability, that is a stable limit cycle oscillation, or a catastrophic instability, that is an unstable LCO. The aero-thermo-visco-elastic governing equations are developed from the geometrically non-linear theory of infinitely long two dimensional curved panels. Von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n non-linear strain-displacement relation in conjunction with the Kirchhoff plate-hypothesis is adopted. A geometrically imperfect curved panel forced by a supersonic/hypersonic unsteady flow is numerically investigated using Galerkin approach. These equations are based on the third-order piston theory aerodynamic for modeling the flow-induced forces. Furthermore, the effects of thermal degradation and Kelvin's model of structural damping are also considered in this model.

84858861357	Panel flutter analysis of plate element based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation	In this study, aeroelastic analysis of a plate subjected to the external supersonic airflow is carried out. A 3-D rectangular plate element of variable thickness based on absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) has been developed for the structural model. In the approach to the problem, a continuum mechanics approach for the definition of the elastic forces within the finite element is considered. Both shear strain and transverse normal strain are taken into account. Linearized first-order potential (piston) theory is coupled with the structural model to account for pressure loading. Aeroelastic equations using ANCF are derived and solved numerically. Values of critical dynamic pressure are obtained by a modal approach, in which the mode shapes are obtained by ANCF. All the formulations and the computations are built up in a FORTRAN 90 computer program after it was confirmed by MathematicaÂ®, ver. 5. The results of free vibration analysis and flutter are compared with the available references and reasonable good agreement has been found. However, some results indicate that the known problem of locking (ANCF with uniform thickness) still persist in the current developed formulation. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.

In the approach to the problem, a general analytical method based on TMM is developed for the vibrations of two uniform Euler-Bernoulli beams coupled by a spring. The components of the transfer matrix are all functions of the system's natural frequency. The overall transfer equation only involves boundary state vectors, whereas the state vectors at all other connection points do not appear. The state vectors at the boundary are composed of displacements, rotation angles, bending moments and shear forces, which are partly known and partly unknown. Moreover, the overall transfer matrix is independent of the degrees of the freedom. A non-trivial solution of the final overall transfer equation requires the coefficient matrix to be singular.

84893065446	A new form of the transfer matrix method for multibody systems	In order to avoid the global dynamic equation of system and increase greatly computational speed for multibody system dynamics (MSD), a new MSDM, transfer matrix method of multibody system (MSTMM) is developed and used very widely in engineering in recent 20 years. MSTMM differs from ordinary methods of multibody systems dynamics in the following features: without the global dynamic equation of system, always lower order of system matrix and high computational efficiency, highly programming. To improve further the computational precision and simplify the transfer matrices of MSTMM so that MSTMM may be used with high accuracy for MSD, a new form of MSTMM is presented in the paper. The accelerations (including angular accelerations) and internal forces (including internal moments) are taken as state variables of the state vector in the new form instead of the original position coordinates (including angles) and internal forces (including internal moments). The new form of MSTMM combines and expands the advantages of MSTMM and the numerical integration procedure, and can be applied to a wide range of problems including multirigid-body system dynamics and multi-flexible-body system dynamics, moreover, linearization of dynamics equations is not needed at all. Meanwhile, not only such advantages of the original MSTMM as without the global dynamic equation of system for the study of MSD, always lower order of system matrix and high computational efficiency, highly programming are remained, but also any high precision numerical method can be used. Formulations of the method as well as some numerical examples of MSD to validate the method are given.

84893112998	Riccati transfer matrix method for eigenvalue problem of the system with antisymmetric boundaries	The transfer matrix method for multibody system (MSTMM) is a new developed multibody system dynamics method. Features of the analysis of multibody system dynamics by using the transfer matrix method are as follow: no need of global dynamic equations of the system, highly systematic programming, low order of matrix involved, high computational efficiency, etc. It provides powerful dynamic design theory, computational and analytical methods for the development of weapons, aircrafts, ships, vehicles, and all kinds of machines. In contrast to the other methods for multibody dynamics, the transfer matrix method for linear multibody systems has proven to be applicable to a variety of systems involving both discrete elements like rigid bodies, springs or dampers, and continuous elements like Euler- Bernoulli or Timoshenko beams. For a pure linear multi-rigid-body system, or in other words, for a linear multibody system composed of discrete elements, the essence of this method is to obtain the characteristic polynomial of the system by the transfer of the state vectors based on the topology of the system and the introductions of boundary conditions. Unfortunately, due to the inherent property of polynomials, numerical instability will emerge when the number of the elements involved or the eigenvalues are too large. An efficient strategy to solve this problem is the Riccati transformation, which is called the Riccati transfer matrix method. However when we treat the eigenvalue problem of the system with antisymmetric boundaries, an equation, which looks like inharmonic, will emerge. In order to solve the problem for the system with antisymmetric boundaries, a strategy based on Riccati transfer matrix method is developed in this paper: the Riccati transformation is only used from the input point of the first element to the input point of the last element. Besides, the result also clarifies the essence of the capability of Riccati transfer matrix method to stabilize the numerical calculation of eigenvalues of the system.

84893146330	Application of the transfer matrix method to control problems	The strategy of the transfer matrix method is to transform differential equations into algebraic equations on an element level and then to assemble the resulting transfer matrices according to the topology of the system. This is rather similar to Laplace transformation in control theory which is a mighty tool for control design. In the paper, it is shown how the transfer matrix approach can be reformulated to combine linear mechanical systems with arbitrary controllers, and to directly deduce structural diagrams from the system topology which then easily lead to overall transfer equations of the systems. They may then serve as a basis for analyzing free vibration characteristics, response behavior to harmonic excitation, as well as tracking and disturbance behaviour of controlled systems. This approach is applied to both external forces, as required for skyhook control concepts, as well as to internal forces being used in active suspensions. It is also extended to rigid bodies with multiple inputs and outputs by using implicit constraint equations.

84893692230	Free vibration characteristic of multilevel beam based on transfer matrix method of linear multibody systems	In this paper, an approach based on transfer matrix method of linear multibody systems (MS-TMM) is developed to analyze the free vibration of a multilevel beam, coupled by spring/dashpot systems attached to them in-span. The Euler-Bernoulli model is used for the transverse vibration of the beams, and the spring/dashpot system represents a simplified model of a viscoelastic material. MS-TMM reduces the dynamic problem to an overall transfer equation which only involves boundary state vectors. The state vectors at the boundaries are composed of displacements, rotation angles, bending moments, and shear forces, which are partly known and partly unknown, and end up with reduced overall transfer matrix. Nontrivial solution requires the coefficient matrix to be singular to yield the required natural frequencies. This paper implements two novel algorithms based on the methodology by reducing the zero search of the reduced overall transfer matrix's determinate to a minimization problem and demonstrates a simple and robust algorithm being much more efficient than direct enumeration. The proposal method is easy to formulate, systematic to apply, and simple to code and can be extended to complex structures with any boundary conditions. Numerical results are presented to show the validity of the proposal method against the published literature. Â© 2014 Laith K. Abbas and Xiaoting Rui.

84894793692	Controller parameters tuning based on transfer matrix method for multibody systems	Transfer matrix method for multibody systems (MS-TMM) is a rife method to multi-rigid-flexible-body systems dynamics model deduction due to that there are no needs to establish the global dynamics equations of the system. Its basic idea is transferring a state vector between the body input(s) and output(s); this idea is close to the linear theories in control analysis and design. In this paper, three controllers' parameters tuning techniques for the proposed system model using MS-TMM are utilized; one technique is applied to get the stability regions via the frequency response of MS-TMM derived model. Another technique considers a classical PID controller design through the analysis of step input response of the system, and the last technique can be applied in both time and frequency domains if the model has a known mathematical model. A car suspension system is considered to represent modeling and tuning problems. In-depth study of MS-TMM with control techniques and defining the controllers' parameters stability regions provide an opportunity to formulate a relationship between MS-TMM and control design for novel control applications due to the powerful strength of MS-TMM dealing with more complex problems of the controlled multibody systems.

84896114229	Numerical calculation of effect of elastic deformation on aerodynamic characteristics of a rocket	The application and workflow of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)/Computational Structure Dynamics (CSD) on solving the static aeroelastic problem of a slender rocket are introduced. To predict static aeroelastic behavior accurately, two-way coupling and inertia relief methods are used to calculate the static deformations and aerodynamic characteristics of the deformed rocket. The aerodynamic coefficients of rigid rocket are computed firstly and compared with the experimental data, which verified the accuracy of CFD output. The results of the analysis for elastic rocket in the nonspinning and spinning states are compared with the rigid ones. The results highlight that the rocket deformation aspects are decided by the normal force distribution along the rocket length. Rocket deformation becomes larger with increasing the flight angle of attack. Drag and lift force coefficients decrease and pitching moment coefficients increase due to rocket deformations, center of pressure location forwards, and stability of the rockets decreases. Accordingly, the flight trajectory may be affected by the change of these aerodynamic coefficients and stability. Â© 2014 Laith K. Abbas et al.

84896308131	Transfer matrix method for multibody systems of TITO system control applications	Many real systems such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) in vibration environment, avionic systems in flight tests, half car dynamic model in rid comfortable test and suspension design...etc. can be expressed as Two-inputs-two-outputs (TITO) system for more realistic analysis than single-input-single-output system (SISO); but with more additional complexities. Comparing Transfer Matrix Method for multibody systems (MSTMM) with classical dynamic methods has preferences of modeling flexibility, low order of system matrix, and high computational efficiency, without necessity of deriving the system's global dynamic equations. The need of combining control strategies with MSTMM becomes an issue of paramount importance due to that a lot of systems are considered as multibody systems, some need control to obtain higher accuracies requirement, vibration isolation treatment,...etc. As a rule of thumb the concept of designing vibration isolator in one field can be applied in many other fields. In this article a generalized TITO model is analyzed using MSTMM to deal with the vibration problem via an active isolator for both vertical translation and pitch responses. Active isolation is applied via Proportional-Integral- Derivative (PID) controller to prove the capability of formulating a relationship between MSTMM and well-known control methodologies to mitigate vibration effects. For verification purpose the analyzed model is verified using data for half car model and standard formulae for road models input excitation test. The achieved results declared that MSTMM can be combined with control techniques without need of special treatments or preconditions for different models with the advantages of MSTMM. This article allows wider developed control applications to use MSTMM simple application for more complex systems models. Dilatation in studying controlled systems using MSTMM provides a possibility for incoming control applications because of the good dealing of MSTMM with the increased complexities of multi-rigid-flexible-body problems.

84897780170	Study on the dynamics of laser Gyro strapdown inertial measurement unit system based on transfer matrix method for multibody system	The dynamic test precision of the strapdown inertial measurement unit (SIMU) is the basis of estimating accurate motion of various vehicles such as warships, airplanes, spacecrafts, and missiles. So, it is paid great attention in the above fields to increase the dynamic precision of SIMU by decreasing the vibration of the vehicles acting on the SIMU. In this paper, based on the transfer matrix method for multibody system (MSTMM), the multibody system dynamics model of laser gyro strapdown inertial measurement unit (LGSIMU) is developed; the overall transfer equation of the system is deduced automatically. The computational results show that the frequency response function of the LGSIMU got by the proposed method and Newton-Euler method have good agreements. Further, the vibration reduction performance and the attitude error responses under harmonic and random excitations are analyzed. The proposed method provides a powerful technique for studying dynamics of LGSIMU because of using MSTMM and its following features: without the global dynamics equations of the system, high programming, low order of system matrix, and high computational speed.

84897795225	Projectile impact point prediction based on self-propelled artillery dynamics and doppler radar measurements	Any trajectory calculation method has three primary sources of errors, which are model error, parameter error, and initial state error. In this paper, based on initial projectile flight trajectory data measured using Doppler radar system; a new iterative method is developed to estimate the projectile attitude and the corresponding impact point to improve the second shot hit probability. In order to estimate the projectile initial state, the launch dynamics model of practical 155 mm self-propelled artillery is defined, and hence, the vibration characteristics of the self-propelled artillery is obtained using the transfer matrix method of linear multibody system MSTMM. A discrete time transfer matrix DTTM-4DOF is developed using the modified point mass equations of motion to compute the projectile trajectory and set a direct algebraic relation between any two successive radar data. During iterations, adjustments to the repose angle are made until an agreement with acceptable tolerance occurs between the Doppler radar measurements and the estimated values. Simulated Doppler radar measurements are generated using the nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom trajectory model using the resulted initial disturbance. Results demonstrate that the data estimated using the proposed algorithm agrees well with the simulated Doppler radar data obtained numerically using the nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom model.

84906261016	Transfer matrix method for multibody systems for piezoelectric stack actuators	In order to achieve a large displacement output from a piezoelectric actuator, we realized the piezoelectric stack actuator (PSA) by mechanically layering/stacking multi-chip piezoelectric wafers in a series and electrically connecting the electrodes in parallel. In this paper, in order to accurately model the hysteresis and the dynamic characteristics of a PSA, the transfer matrix method for multibody systems (MSTMM) was adopted to describe the dynamic characteristics, and the Bouc-Wen hysteresis operator was used to represent the hysteresis. The vibration characteristics of a PSA and a piezo-actuated positioning mechanism (PPM) are derived and analyzed by the MSTMM; then, the dynamic responses of the PSA and the PPM are calculated. The experimental results show that the new method can accurately portray the hysteresis and the dynamic characteristics of a PSA and a PPM. On one hand, if we use this method to model the dynamic response of the PSA and the PPM, the PSA can be considered as a flexible body, as opposed to a mass-spring-damper system, which is in better agreement with the actual condition. On the other hand, the global dynamics equation is not needed for the study of system dynamics, and the dynamics equation has a small-sized matrix and a higher computational speed. Therefore, this method gives a broad range of possibilities for model-based controller design. Â© 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84912048082	Recursive eigenvalue search algorithm for transfer matrix method of linear flexible multibody systems	The transfer matrix method is a rather unusual strategy of modeling linear multibody systems, however, it is able to elegantly model systems including both discrete and continuous elements and to solve such kind of problems with any precision required. This is achieved by transforming differential to algebraic equations and summarizing all system information in an overall system of linear equations independent of the degrees of freedom. Nontrivial solutions representing vibration modes then require the coefficient matrix to be singular. Thus, the precision of solutions is associated with the ability of finding zeros for the determinants of these coefficient matrices, which may be nonlinear or transcendental, real or complex functions of natural vibration frequencies or complex eigenvalues. The paper reduces the zero search to a minimization problem and suggests two simple, but robust algorithms which are much more efficient than direct enumeration. Further, the problem of noisy determinant computation is addressed and the complex transfer matrix of a rod for damped vibrations is derived. Three basic examples serve for demonstrating the concept and for showing the robustness of the proposed approach. For a rod-damper system, the solution with jumping frequencies for a critical damping value can be proven analytically.

84921701082	Aerothermoelastic analysis of panel flutter based on the absolute nodal coordinate formulation	Panels of reentry vehicles are subjected to a wide range of flow conditions during ascent and reentry phases. The flow can vary from subsonic continuum flow to hypersonic rarefied flow with wide ranging dynamic pressure and associated aerodynamic heating. One of the main design considerations is the assurance of safety against panel flutter under the flow conditions characterized by sever thermal environment. This paper deals with supersonic/hypersonic flutter analysis of panels exposed to a temperature field. A 3-D rectangular plate element of variable thickness based on absolute nodal coordinate formulation (ANCF) has been developed for the structural model and subjected to an assumed thermal profile that can result from any residual heat seeping into the metallic panels through the thermal protection systems. A continuum mechanics approach for the definition of the elastic forces within the finite element is considered. Both shear strain and transverse normal strain are taken into account. The aerodynamic force is evaluated by considering the first-order piston theory to linearize the potential flow and is coupled with the structural model to account for pressure loading. A provision is made to take into account the effect of arbitrary flow directions with respect to the panel edges. Aerothermoelastic equations using ANCF are derived and solved numerically. Values of critical dynamic pressure are obtained by a modal approach, in which the mode shapes are obtained by ANCF. A detailed parametric study is carried out to observe the effects of different temperature loadings, flow angle directions, and aspect ratios on the flutter boundary.

Then, analysis is carried using ANSYS Workbench multi-physics coupling platform, which includes fluid, thermal, and structural solvers. The results show that spinning causes a significant effect on the deformations and stresses. Furthermore, thermal stresses due to high temperature at the rocket warhead and tail edges have a dominated effect, even more than those produced by aerodynamic forces. Consequently, this important outcome should be taken into consideration during the rocket design stages.
