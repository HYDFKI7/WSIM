Under external electric field, the natural resonance frequency and permeability of the Co film were found to modulate between 1.8-2.8GHz and 50-150, respectively. In addition, the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy field can also be electrically tuned from 54 to 170Oe, while the ferromagnetic resonance field was substantially enhanced about 350Oe as well. Such an improvement of magnetic anisotropy is desirable for effectively electric control of resonance frequency and permeability in low energy microwave devices. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

37249053874	Synthesis of ultrafine amorphous Fe-B alloy nanoparticles using anodic aluminum oxide templates	Ultrafine amorphous Fe-B alloy nanoparticles are self-assembled within anodic aluminum oxide templates by combining a preparation process of Fe-B nanoparticles with a template method. Scanning electron microscopy, inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, Mössbauer spectrometry, and vibrating sample magnetometry are employed to study the morphology, chemical composition, structure, and magnetic properties of the nanoparticle assemblies, respectively. The results show that the alloy particles are amorphous with a boron content of 24 at. % and can be in shape of sphere and rod by controlling the duration of preparation. There is a narrow distribution of the sizes of spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter below 35 nm in relatively short preparation time, while rods are found in longer time. The measurements of magnetic properties indicate that the nanoparticles are mostly in superparamagnetic state and the self-assembly of the nanoparticles has a weak magnetic anisotropy with an easy direction perpendicular to the template plane. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

37549043583	An approach for researching uniaxial anisotropy magnet: Rotational magnetization	In this study, rotational magnetization curves are used to investigate the anisotropy and the rotational magnetization process of uniaxial magnets. We measured the projection of magnetization as a function of angle between the magnetic field and the reference axis. The information about anisotropy, such as the directions of the easy axis and hard axis, as well as the anisotropy field Hk (i), is acquired. Simultaneously, the rotational magnetization reversal processes are derived. The Co and Fe28 Co61 Zr11 magnetic thin films with induced in-plane uniaxial anisotropy have been researched. We found that the rotational magnetization reversal process of the Co film is a coherent rotation. However, the Fe28 Co61 Zr11 film shows the similar behavior, except for a noncoherent rotation appearing when a small field parallels the hard axis. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.

Based on this model, the expressions of critical field for the irreversible reversal magnetization and the coercive force are derived for both the parallel rotation and symmetric fanning mechanisms. The influences of the contact angle of the ellipsoids, the uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the angle between the applied magnetic field and the axis of the chain, the number of ellipsoids and the shape factor of single ellipsoid on the critical field and the coercive force are discussed. The results based on the model indicate that the magnetization reversal process of the Ni nanowire may have the symmetric fanning mechanism.

37749012804	Detection of explosives by coherent X-ray scatter signature	Coherent X-ray scatter technology or energy-dispersive X-ray diffraction has been used for many years as a method to measure the atomic planar spacings in a crystalline substance. In this paper, this method has been shown to be of particular use when the requirement is to differentiate between low Z materials where transmission techniques provide very little contrast. We applied this technique to the detection and identification of explosives. Energy-dispersive detectors were used to collect coherent scatter spectra at a small angles (6.5°). It is shown that the information from these 'signatures' can be used to determine whether an explosive sample is present or not. The geometrical configuration of the collimation and the position of the subject must be take into careful consideration when optimizing the capabilities of such a system.

It is found that the experimental data do not agree with the GSDCP theory on the transition location of different grain size ranges (The GSDCP theory has three different grain size ranges for different magnetization processes.). Correspondingly, including the grain size distribution the GSDCP theory fits the experimental data very well. These results prove that the grain size distribution indeed affects the magnetic properties of nanocrystalline ferromagnets. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to achieve automatically and successively coating PSM and plastic (sealing PSM) on prestressed strand only once, both PSM with Bingham plastic in screw channel and annular passage surrounding strand and polyethylene sheath must be in fully flow state, which means screw revolutions and coating velocity exist respective critical values.

In situ control over the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy field, which varied from 1.6 to 22.7 kA m-1, was achieved by adjusting the deposition oblique angle from 0° to 38°.

Then, the particles were coated with a hydrophilic shell by the hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), which enabled water dispersal of the resulting nanoparticles.

All the characterization results proved the final samples possessed magnetic and fluorescent properties simultaneously.

70049115435	Abnormal coercivity dependence on the diameter of Co nanowires in anodic aluminium oxide templates	Co nanowire arrays with diameters of 20 and 50 nm are fabricated into anodic aluminium oxide templates by the ac electrodeposition technique. The coercivity of nanowire arrays with diameter of 50 nm is 1990 Oe, whereas that of nanowire arrays with diameter of 20 nm is only 925 Oe. This is quite different from earlier experimental results of magnetic metal nanowire arrays, which exhibit larger coercivity at a diameter of 20 nm. X-ray diffraction patterns suggest that the anomalous increase in coercivity is related to the appearance of the (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) reflections. Micromagnetism simulation reveals the mechanism of how the (0 0 2) texture of nanowires influences the magnetic properties of Co nanowire arrays. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The surface functionalization of fly ash (FA) with amino groups was found to play an important role in the formation of the well-defined blackberry morphology. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed that the well-defined blackberry-like morphology of the polypyrrole/amino-functionalized fly ash (PPy/A-FA) composites with size range of 0.3-5 μm and the surface of the composites became smoother with more A-FA charged in the in situ chemical oxidative polymerization. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of the PPy/A-FA composites showed the similar patterns as FA, which revealed that the crystal structure of FA was well-maintained after the surface functionalization and the in situ chemical oxidative polymerization. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the thermal stability of PPy/A-FA composites was enhanced and this could be attributed to the retardation effect of amine-functionalized fly ashes as barriers for the degradation of polypyrrole. The composites possess high electrical conductivity at room temperature, weak temperature dependence of the conductivity and good magnetic properties. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Selected area electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction results indicate that the structure of nanowires is amorphous. Vibrating sample magnetometer is employed to study the magnetic properties of nanowire arrays at room temperature. The results show that the arrays of nanowires exhibit uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the easy magnetization direction along the nanowire axes owing to the large shape anisotropy.

77952105676	Thickness dependence of magnetic anisotropic properties of FeCoNd films	The magnetic FeCoNd films with thickness (t) from 50 to 166 nm were fabricated by RF magnetron co-sputtering at ambient condition. The amorphous structures of all of the films were investigated by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. A spin reorientation transition from in-plane single domain state to out-of-plane stripe domain state was observed as a function of t. When t is below a critical thickness, magnetic moments lie in the film plane corresponding to in-plane single domain state because of the strong demagnetization energy. However, when t is increased, out-of-plane stripe domain structure was developed due to a dominated perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Scanning electron microscopy data indicate that the perpendicular anisotropy, which is responsible for the formation of stripe domains, may result from the shape effect of the columnar growth of the FeCo grains. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

77957562083	The effect of human rhythm on packet delivery	In communication networks such as the Internet, the relationship between packet generation rate and time is similar to a rectangle wavefunction due to the rhythm of humans. Thus, we investigate the traffic dynamics on a network with a rectangle wavepacket generation rate. It is found that the critical delivering capacity parameter βc (which separates the congested phase and the free phase) decreases significantly with the duty cycle r of the rectangle wave for package generation. And, in the congested phase, more collective generation of packets (smaller r) is helpful for decreasing the packet aggregation rate. Moreover, it is found that the congested phase can be divided into two regions, i.e., region1 and region2, where the distributions of queue lengths are nonlinear and linear, respectively. Also, the linear expression for the distribution of queue lengths in region2 is obtained analytically. Our work reveals an obvious effect of the rectangle wave on the traffic dynamics and the queue length distribution in the system, which is of essential interest and may provide insights into the designing of work-rest schedules and routing strategies. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA.

The longest lifetime component in PALS results is ascribed to the annihilation of positronium in cavities of PS sample. It is found that 80% of the positrons implanted in PS film have formed positronium atoms. PALS results show that the lifetime of ortho-positronium has smaller value when the sample was in oxygen gas medium compared with those in other medium. AMOC results reveal that S parameter of three lifetime components in oxygen are all bigger than that in nitrogen atmosphere.

Magnetic measurements indicate that all of the CuO nanostructures show room-temperature ferromagnetism, whereas CuO bulk presents paramagnetism. The saturation magnetization of the samples was found to increase with increasing annealing temperature. The fitting results of the O 1s XPS spectra for the three samples indicate that oxygen vacancies exist in the samples and that the variation of the oxygen vacancy concentration is in complete agreement with the variation of the saturation magnetization. When the samples were annealed in oxygen atmosphere, the ferromagnetism of the samples decreased enormously.

79956121941	Recovery of soft magnetic properties of FeNiSm films by Ta interlayer	The magnetic properties of FeNiSm thin films with different thicknesses, different Ta interlayer thicknesses and different numbers of Ta interlayers were investigated. The single layer FeNiSm shows in-plane uniaxial anisotropy at a thickness below critical value, but shows weak perpendicular anisotropy with a stripe domain structure at thickness above the critical value. Experiments indicate that one or more Ta interlayers inserted into thick FeNiSm films with weak perpendicular anisotropy were effective not only in canceling the perpendicular anisotropy, but also in recovering the in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. Blocking of the columnar growth of FeNi grains by the Ta interlayer is considered to be responsible for this spin reorientation phenomenon. Moreover, the magnetization reversal mechanism in FeNiSm films with uniaxial anisotropy can be ascribed to coherent rotation when the applied field is close to the hard axis and to domain-wall unpinning when the applied field is close to the easy axis. The dynamic magnetic properties of FeNiSm films with uniaxial anisotropy were investigated in the frequency range 0.15 GHz. The degradation of the soft magnetic properties of magnetic thin films due to the growth of columnar grains can be avoided by insertion of a Ta interlayer. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The relationship between the Faraday rotation angle per unit length with different nanowire diameters and photon energy has been found to exhibit clear spectroscopic structure.

84863895240	Seebeck rectification enabled by intrinsic thermoelectrical coupling in magnetic tunneling junctions	An intrinsic thermoelectric coupling effect in the linear response regime of magnetic tunneling junctions (MTJ) is reported. In the dc response, it leads to a nonlinear correction to Ohm's law. Dynamically, it enables a novel Seebeck rectification and second harmonic generation, which apply for a broad frequency range and can be magnetically controlled. A phenomenological model on the footing of the Onsager reciprocal relation and the principle of energy conservation explains very well the experimental results obtained from both dc and frequency-dependent transport measurements performed up to GHz frequencies. Our work refines previous understanding of magnetotransport and microwave rectification in MTJs. It forms a new foundation for utilizing spin caloritronics in high-frequency applications. © 2012 American Physical Society.

84863982485	Tuning stress-induced magnetic anisotropy and high frequency properties of FeCo films deposited on different curvature substrates	It is important to control magnetic anisotropy of ferromagnetic materials. In this work, FeCo thin films are deposited on the curving substrates by electrochemical deposition to adjust the stress-induced magnetic anisotropy. The compressive stress is produced in the as-deposited films after the substrates are flattened. A simplified theoretical model of ferromagnetic resonance is utilized to measure the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy field and saturation magnetization. The results show that the stress-induced magnetic anisotropy and the resonance frequency increase with the increase of substrate curvature. The induced easy axis is perpendicular to the compressive stress direction. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84864739702	Understanding magnetic properties of arrays of small FePt dots with perpendicular anisotropy	FePt dot arrays with dot size down to 15 nm are fabricated by film annealing and patterning. The array coercivity shows an increase with dot size decreasing from 100 to 30 nm, and a slight reduction for the 15 nm dot sample. Annealing these dot arrays at higher temperatures results in large enhancements in the coercivities, except the 15 nm dot array where the coercivity increases a little. Micromagnetic models of a 15 nm FePt dot with uniform and nonuniform edges of soft magnetic defects and with inside defects are calculated to reveal the microstructure origins of the dot magnetic properties.

84865826369	Adjustable magnetic anisotropy and resonance frequency of patterned ferromagnetic films by laser etching	A simple laser etching method is utilized to adjust magnetic anisotropy and resonance frequency of patterned FeCo thin films from 12 to 700 Oe and from 1.0 to 8.2 GHz, respectively. The results show the demagnetization effect is yet evident when the strip widths vary from 0.05 mm to 1.00 mm. The magnetic anisotropy of the sample can be controlled by altering strip width and direction under the action of induced magnetic field. The resonance frequency of unpatterned films is 3.6 GHz. When strip direction is parallel to induced magnetic field direction, the resonance frequency of patterned films shifts to larger value with decreasing strip width. On the contrary, the resonance frequency decreases when strip direction is perpendicular to induced magnetic field direction. A shape anisotropy model based on the shape demagnetization effect is developed to estimate the effective in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

84868340232	Enhanced microwave absorption in columnar structured magnetic materials	CoZr columnar structured magnetic films were fabricated by oblique sputtering onto porous aluminum oxide substrates with different oblique angles. The scanning electron microscope images showed the formation of columnar structure and nanoporous structure was disappeared with increasing oblique angle. The static magnetic properties showed larger coercivity and lower magnetization squareness due to columnar structure resulted from nanopores. Dynamic magnetic properties were determined by effect of holes and oblique sputtering. Enhanced microwave absorption was obtained by complex permeability measurement, which line width of columnar film increased 1.4 GHz comparing with 0.5 GHz of continuous film. Therefore, it is an effective way to get the adjustable anisotropy field and line width, which is desirable for obtaining the high resonance and high permeability ferromagnetic film materials for high frequency application. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84870475926	Nanoscale characterization and magnetic property of NiCoCu/Cu multilayer nanowires	NiCo/Cu multilayer nanowires have been successfully fabricated by a pulse electrodeposition technique using anodic aluminum oxide templates, and their chemistry, crystal structure and magnetic properties characterized at the nanoscale. It was found that each individual nanowire had a regular periodic structure. The NiCo/Cu nanowires also displayed a continuous morphology, smooth surface and polycrystalline fcc structure. EDX elemental mappings confirmed the presence of nickel, cobalt and copper, which appear clearly with a periodic distribution throughout the samples. Both the NiCo and Cu layers were polycrystalline and the average length of the interlayers between NiCo and Cu layers was approximately 3-4 nm. The NiCo/Cu nanowire arrays had an easy axis parallel to the length of wire and exhibited a curling magnetization reversal mechanism. This study highlights the basis morphological, structural and chemical information for NiCoCu/Cu multilayer nanowires, which is critical for their applications in nanodevices and nanoelectronics. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84870946767	Observation of rotatable stripe domain in permalloy films with oblique sputtering	Stripe domain (SD) in obliquely sputtered permalloy films were investigated by comparing with normally sputtered ones. The critical thickness for SD formation of obliquely sputtered films was about 100 nm thinner than that of normally sputtered films. The hysteresis loops of obliquely sputtered films showed a peculiar shape. A rotation of SD towards easy axis was observed in the obliquely sputtered films, which was confirmed by permeability spectra under a bias field. The origin of the rotation could result from in-plane uniaxial anisotropy, which is induced by the shape effect of the oblique columnar growth of permalloy grains. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.

84873019210	Universality of flux-fluctuation law in complex dynamical systems	Recent work has revealed a law governing flux fluctuation and the average flux in complex dynamical systems. We establish the universality of this flux-fluctuation law through the following steps: (i) We derive the law in a more general setting, showing that it depends on a single parameter characterizing the external driving; (ii) we conduct extensive numerical computations using distinct external driving, different network topologies, and multiple traffic routing strategies; and (iii) we analyze data from an actual vehicle traffic system in a major city in China to lend more credence to the universality of the flux-fluctuation law. Additional factors considered include flux fluctuation on links, window size effect, and hidden topological structures such as nodal degree correlation. Besides its fundamental importance in complex systems, the flux-fluctuation law can be used to infer certain intrinsic property of the system for potential applications such as control of complex systems for improved performance. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84875201435	Ferromagnetism in sphalerite and wurtzite CdS nanostructures	Room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed in undoped sphalerite and wurtzite CdS nanostructures which are synthesized by hydrothermal methods. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicate that the sphalerite CdS samples show a spherical-like shape and the wurtzite CdS ones show a flower-like shape, both of which are aggregated by lots of smaller particles. The impurity of the samples has been ruled out by the results of X-ray diffraction, selected-area electron diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Magnetization measurements indicate that all the samples exhibit room-temperature ferromagnetism and the saturation magnetization decreases with the increased crystal sizes, revealing that the observed ferromagnetism is defect-related, which is also confirmed by the post-annealing processes. This finding in CdS should be the focus of future electronic and spintronic devices. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee Springer.

84874858523	Microwave absorption properties of amorphous iron nanostructures fabricated by a high-yield method	Amorphous Fe nanoparticles and a nanonecklace were synthesized at room temperature by an aqueous reduction procedure, which provided a simple and potential method for volume production of ferromagnetic materials. The morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The amorphism of Fe nanoparticles and the nanonecklace was confirmed by x-ray diffraction and electron diffraction patterns in transmission electron microscopy. The complex permittivity and permeability behaviour of amorphous iron nanoparticles/paraffin wax (NPPW) and nanonecklace/paraffin wax (NCPW) composites was investigated in 0.1-18 GHz by a coaxial method. The strongest reflection loss values of NPPW and NCPW calculated from permittivity and permeability reached -53.2 dB and -47.8 dB at 6.4 GHz and 4.6 GHz with matching thicknesses of 2.4 mm and 2.3 mm, respectively. Moreover, the frequency ranges of microwave absorption exceeding 90% were around 4.9-8.8 GHz and 3.7-6.1 GHz for NPPW and NCPW, respectively. Comparing the microwave absorption property with crystallized Fe nanostructures, we may conclude that the relatively high resistivity and low permittivity of amorphous Fe nanostructures are favourable for impedance matching, and consequently result in the attracting microwave absorption property of amorphous Fe nanostructures. Thus, amorphous iron nanoparticles and the nanonecklace prepared by a high-yield method have great potential to be a highly efficient microwave absorber. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The results show that the permeabilities and resonant frequency are depended on the walls thickness of nanorings. The underlying mechanism is ascribed to the presence of strong demagnetization fields, which are associated to the rings wall. In addition, the products of magnetic susceptibility and resonant frequency are larger than that predicted from Snoeks law in polycrystalline particles. These results are direct manifestations of the bi-anisotropy model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84879101136	A large magnetoresistance effect in p-n junction devices by the space-charge effect	The finding of an extremely large magnetoresistance effect on silicon based p-n junction with vertical geometry over a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields is reported. A 2500% magnetoresistance ratio of the Si p-n junction is observed at room temperature with a magnetic field of 5 T and the applied bias voltage of only 6 V, while a magnetoresistance ratio of 25 000% is achieved at 100 K. The current-voltage (I-V) behaviors under various external magnetic fields obey an exponential relationship, and the magnetoresistance effect is significantly enhanced by both contributions of the electric field inhomogeneity and carrier concentrations variation. Theoretical analysis using classical p-n junction transport equation is adapted to describe the I-V curves of the p-n junction at different magnetic fields and reveals that the large magnetoresistance effect origins from a change of space-charge region in the p-n junction induced by external magnetic field. The results indicate that the conventional p-n junction is proposed to be used as a multifunctional material based on the interplay between electronic and magnetic response, which is significant for future magneto-electronics in the semiconductor industry. A large magnetoresistance effect in conventional silicon p-n junctions is reported. By utilizing the magnetic field to manipulate the space-charge region of the p-n junction, a 2500% magnetoresistance ratio is observed at room temperature with H = 5 T. The p-n junction controlled by both electric field and magnetic field will open a new avenue for future magneto-electronics. Copyright © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

84884506442	Origin of the unexpected room temperature ferromagnetism: Formation of artificial defects on the surface in NaCl particles	The unexpected room temperature ferromagnetism in pure sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with different crystal size synthesized by breaking at different times is attributed to surface defects, which provides a novel opportunity to further understand the origin of ferromagnetism in the traditional "nonmagnetic" inorganic non-metallic materials. The results of X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy suggest that breaking progress does not change the samples' body, but drastically reduces the size of the samples, what's more, it is found to enhance the strength of the ferromagnetic component with decreasing the samples' size through magnetism measure; the first-principle calculation results confirm the experimental conclusion. Ferromagnetism originates from surface effect, probably the long range ferromagnetic interactions between the surface Cl vacancies. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

84887050688	Manipulating femtosecond magnetism through pressure: First-principles calculations	Inspired by a recent pressure experiment in fcc Ni, we propose a simple method to use pressure to investigate the laser-induced femtosecond magnetism. Since the pressure effect on the electronic and magnetic properties can be well controlled experimentally, this leaves little room for ambiguity when compared with theory. Here we report our theoretical pressure results in fcc Ni: Pressure first suppresses the spin moment reduction and then completely diminishes it; further increase in pressure to 40 GPa induces a demagnetization-to- magnetization transition. To reveal its microscopic origin, we slide through the L-U line in the Brillouin zone and find two essential transitions are responsible for this change, where the pressure lowers two valence bands, resulting in an off-resonant excitation and thus a smaller spin moment reduction. In the spin-richest L-W-W′ plane, two spin contours are formed; as pressure increases, the contour size retrieves and its intensity is reduced to zero eventually, fully consistent with the spin-dipole factor prediction. These striking features are detectable in time- and spin-resolved photoemission experiments. © 2013 American Physical Society.

84889049004	Tunable in-plane uniaxial anisotropy and the magnetization reversal mechanism of patterned high-frequency soft magnetic FeTa strips	FeTa films with thickness of 110 nm are fabricated on glass substrates by magnetron sputtering, and then a series of strips is designed on the FeTa films by conventional optical lithography and the ion beam etching method. Patterned FeTa strips show a tunable in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy property in contrast with the magnetic isotropic property of as-deposited FeTa thin films. The magnetization reversal mechanism of the patterned FeTa strips is investigated via the in-plane angular dependences of magnetization and coercivity. The angular dependence of coercivity (ADC) is explained well in terms of the two-phase model, giving good quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured M-shaped ADC curve. The domain structure and spatial resolution magneto-optical Kerr effect measurement indicate that the smaller the strip width, the stronger will be the anisotropy field. Regarding the dynamic magnetic properties, a transformation from Debye dispersion spectrum for strips with weak anisotropy to natural resonance spectrum for strips with strong anisotropy is finally obtained. The tunable in-plane anisotropy fields of the FeTa strips result in tunable high-frequency soft magnetic properties by altering the strip width, indicating that patterned FeTa strips have great potential in high-frequency soft magnetic application fields. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.

84891447536	Dirac cone in α-graphdiyne: A first-principles study	We investigate the Dirac cone in α-graphdiyne, which is a predicted flat one-atom-thick allotrope of carbon using first-principles calculations. α-graphdiyne is derived from graphene where two acetylenic linkages (-C≡C-) are inserted into the single bonds (-C-C-). Thus, α-graphdiyne possesses a larger lattice constant which subsequently affects its electronic properties. Band structures show that α-graphdiyne exhibits similar Dirac points and cone to graphene. Further, the tight-binding method is used to exploit the linear dispersion in the vicinity of Dirac points. Thanks to the larger lattice constant, α-graphdiyne yields a lower Fermi velocity, which might make itself an ideal material to serve the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect. © 2013 Niu et al.; licensee Springer.

84899006027	Energy gaps in α-graphdiyne nanoribbons	α-graphdiyne is a novel predicted Dirac cone material, which is similar to graphene. But the absence of a band gap significantly limits its practical applications. In order to extend this limitation, an opening of energy gap is needed. To this end, we resort to the nanoribbon structure of α-graphdiyne. This is a conventional proposal to open up the energy gaps in nanomaterials. The results show that both the armchair and the zigzag α-graphdiyne nanoribbons do generate energy gaps, which are width-dependent. In addition, the underlying mechanism of this opening is explored. The former is ascribed to the combination of quantum confinement and edges' effect, while the latter arises from the edge magnetic ordering. These novel nanoribbons with opening energy gaps would be potentially used in electronic devices. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84901459790	Crystal-momentum dispersion of ultrafast spin change in fcc Co	Nearly twenty years ago, Beaurepaire and coworkers showed that when an ultrafast laser impinges on a ferromagnet, its spin moment undergoes a dramatic change, but how it works remains a mystery. While the current experiment is still unable to resolve the minute details of the spin change, crystal momentum-resolved techniques have long been used to analyze the charge dynamics in superconductors and strongly correlated materials. Here we extend it to probe spin moment change in the entire three-dimensional Brillouin zone for fcc Co. Our results indeed show a strong spin activity along the Δ line, supporting a prior experimental finding. The spin active pockets coalesce into a series of spin surfaces that follow the Fermi surfaces. We predict two largest spin change pockets which have been elusive to experiments: one pocket is slightly below the Δ line and the other is along the Δ line and close to the L point. Our theory presents an opportunity for the time-, spin- and momentum-resolve photoemission technique.

84901767846	Intrinsic ferromagnetism in hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets	Understanding the mechanism of ferromagnetism in hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets, which possess only s and p electrons in comparison with normal ferromagnets based on localized d or f electrons, is a current challenge. In this work, we report an experimental finding that the ferromagnetic coupling is an intrinsic property of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets, which has never been reported before. Moreover, we further confirm it from ab initio calculations. We show that the measured ferromagnetism should be attributed to the localized π states at edges, where the electron-electron interaction plays the role in this ferromagnetic ordering. More importantly, we demonstrate such edge-induced ferromagnetism causes a high Curie temperature well above room temperature. Our systematical work, including experimental measurements and theoretical confirmation, proves that such unusual room temperature ferromagnetism in hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets is edge-dependent, similar to widely reported graphene-based materials. It is believed that this work will open new perspectives for hexagonal boron nitride spintronic devices. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84904878074	Crystal momentum-dependent anisotropy of the Dirac cone in the rectangular carbon allotropes	Thanks to the perfect hexagonal lattice, graphene holds an isotropic Dirac cone. This means that the group velocities of charge carriers in the vicinity of Dirac points are isotropic in momentum space. When the lattice structure varies, the Dirac cone will undergo a dramatic change accordingly. This is the case of 6,6,12-graphyne. Due to the rectangular lattice, Dirac cones of 6,6,12-graphyne are anisotropic. To understand its underlying nature, three additional derivates of 6,6,12-graphyne with the rectangular lattice are studied by using an ab initio method. Although the existence of a Dirac cone critically depends on the hopping energies within the unit cell, the anisotropy of the Dirac cone is another story. This is because the anisotropy of the Dirac cone describes the relation between carriers' group velocities, and is thus direction-dependent in momentum space. Our study demonstrates that the anisotropy of the Dirac cone is tunable through changing the lattice constants or the lattice ratios in the rectangular carbon allotropes. This will be the focus of future research as the anisotropy of the Dirac cone can be regarded as an information carrier. © CopyrightEPLA, 2014.

84906545207	A theoretical study of blue phosphorene nanoribbons based on first-principles calculations	Based on first-principles calculations, we present a quantum confinement mechanism for the band gaps of blue phosphorene nanoribbons (BPNRs) as a function of their widths. The BPNRs considered have either armchair or zigzag shaped edges on both sides with hydrogen saturation. Both the two types of nanoribbons are shown to be indirect semiconductors. An enhanced energy gap of around 1 eV can be realized when the ribbon's width decreases to ∼ 10 Å. The underlying physics is ascribed to the quantum confinement effect. More importantly, the parameters to describe quantum confinement are obtained by fitting the calculated band gaps with respect to their widths. The results show that the quantum confinement in armchair nanoribbons is stronger than that in zigzag ones. This study provides an efficient approach to tune the band gap in BPNRs. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

84907023056	A visualized investigation at the atomic scale of the antitumor effect of magnetic nanomedicine on gastric cancer cells	Aim: Discovering which anticancer drugs attack which organelle(s) of cancer cells is essential and significant, not only for understanding their therapeutic and adverse effects, but also to enable the development of new-generation therapeutics. Here, we show that novel Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-carboxymethyl cellulose-5-fluorouracil (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-CMC-5FU) nanomedicine can apparently enhance the antitumor effect on gastric cancer cells, and its mechanism of killing the SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells can be directly observed at the atomic scale. Materials & methods: The novel nanomedicine was prepared using the traditional antitumor drug 5FU to chemically bond onto the functionalized Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>nanoparticles (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-CMC-5FU nanomedicine), and then was fed into SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. The inorganic Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>nanoparticles were used to track the distribution and antitumor effect of the nanomedicine within individual SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. Results & discussion: Atomic-level observation and tracking the elemental distribution inside individual cells proved that the magnetic nanomedicine killed the gastric cells mainly by attacking their mitochondria. The enhanced therapeutic efficacy derives from the localized high concentration and poor mobility of the aggregated Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-CMC-5FU nanomedicine in the cytoplasm. Conclusion: A brand new mechanism of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-CMC-5FU nanomedicine killing SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells by attacking their mitochondria was discovered, which is different from the classical mechanism utilized by traditional medicine 5FU, which kills gastric cancer cells by damaging their DNA.

The morphological, structural and magnetic properties of these epitaxial films were examined by a variety of experimental techniques. In the growth process of PbTiO<inf>3</inf> films with a perovskite structure, the nucleations appear as islands firstly and subsequent growth follows the layer-by-layer growth mode; simultaneously as increase of growth time the stress between films and substrates releases gradually, the lattices of films follow substrates at first and then the films obey their own lattices; the crystal quality is increasing during this growth process. Meanwhile the results of magnetic measurement reveal that our films have the unambiguous ferromagnetism, and the strength of the ferromagnetic component decreases monotonously as increasing crystal quality. In addition, the growth mechanism involved a dissolution-crystallization mechanism is exposed.
