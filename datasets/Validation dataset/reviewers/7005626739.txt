9244230569	Extracts from cigarette smoke induce DNA damage and cell adhesion molecule expression through different pathways	Cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for human diseases, such as lung cancer and atherosclerosis. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of non-fractionated water-soluble cigarette smoke extract (NFWS CSE) on DNA damage and cellular adhesion molecule expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DNA damage and the surface expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and E-selectin were determined by the use of the comet assay and flow cytometry, respectively. NFWS CSE-induced DNA damage in a dose-dependent manner during a 2 h exposure. Pretreatment with ascorbic acid or α-tocopherol completely inhibited the NFWS CSE-induced DNA damage. NFWS CSE exposure also up-regulated the surface expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs. Pretreatment with ascorbic acid or α-tocopherol had no effect on NFWS CSE-induced E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression. In contrast, the non-antioxidant metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline partially suppressed the surface expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin. These results suggest that NFWS CSE exposure induces both DNA damage and the surface expression of adhesion molecules in HUVECs. However, the molecular mechanism of these effects may be through different pathways: reactive oxygen species are involved in NFWS CSE-induced DNA damage but have little relation to NFWS CSE-induced E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

18344376077	Sulfur amino acid restriction induces the π class of glutathione S-transferase expression in primary rat hepatocytes	The regulation of genes by amino acids is attracting increasing attention. In the present study, we investigated the restriction of expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase (GST Yp) by sulfur amino acids. Hepatocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured with L-15-based medium containing low (LSAA; 0.1 mmol/L L-methionine and 0.1 mmol/L L-cysteine) or high (HSAA; 0.5 mmol/L L-methionine and 0.2 mmol/L L-cysteine) amounts of sulfur amino acids for up to 6 d. Cellular protein contents did not differ between LSAA- and HSAA-treated cells over the entire period. In contrast, glutathione concentrations were suppressed by the LSAA medium and on d 6 were only 20% of those of HSAA-treated cells (P < 0.05). As shown by immunoblot analysis, GST Yp protein levels were greater in LSAA-treated cells than in HSAA-treated cells (P < 0.05). The induction of GST Yp by L-methionine and L-cysteine restriction was not affected by insulin and dexamethasone, but the latter suppressed GST Yp expression (P < 0.05). LSAA increased GST Yp mRNA levels and GST activity toward ethacrynic acid (P < 0.05). GST Yp induction occurred only in cells with a limited supply of L-methionine; restriction of L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, and L-phenylalanine had no significant effect. In contrast with the induction of GST Yp, the expression of the GST isoforms Ya and Yb was not changed by amino acid restriction. In conclusion, hepatic GST Yp gene expression is upregulated by a limited availability of sulfur amino acids. © 2005 American Society for Nutritional Sciences.

1842530530	Diallyl Trisulfide Modulates Cell Viability and the Antioxidation and Detoxification Systems of Rat Primary Hepatocytes	This study investigated the effects of various concentrations of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) and incubation times on cell viability, glutathione (GSH) content, and GSH-related enzyme activity in rat primary hepatocytes. Isolated and cultured primary rat hepatocytes were used as an experimental model. Cells were treated with 0 (control), 0.025, 0.05, or 0.25 mmol/L DATS for 0, 4, 8, or 24 h. After 24 h of treatment, some cells were incubated in fresh medium without DATS for an additional 24 h (48-h incubations). Based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and morphological examination, hepatocytes treated with 0.025 mmol/L DATS did not differ from the control cells at 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of incubation. However, LDH leakage was higher than in the control cells (P < 0.05) when the hepatocytes were treated with 0.05 or 0.25 mmol/L DATS for 4 h or more. The intracellular GSH levels of hepatocytes treated with 0.025 or 0.05 mmol/L DATS were higher than those of the control cells (P < 0.05), whereas those treated with 0.25 mmol/L DATS did not differ. The activity of glutathione reductase (GRd) was higher than in the control cells at 24 h (P < 0.05) when the hepatocytes were treated with 0.025 mmol/L DATS. When the hepatocytes were treated with 0.025 mmol/L DATS, the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was higher than in the control cells at 48 h (P < 0.05). In hepatocytes treated with 0.05 mmol/L DATS, the activity of GST and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was higher than in the control cells (P < 0.05) at 24 and 48 h of incubation. The results indicate that 0.025 or 0.05 mmol/L DATS could enhance antioxidation and detoxification cap abilities by increasing the intracellular GSH level and the activity of GPx, GRd, or GST in rat primary hepatocytes. However, 0.05 or 0.25 mmol/L DATS might adversely affect the viability of hepatocytes.

20444388031	Effects of garlic oil and diallyl trisulfide on glycemic control in diabetic rats	We investigated the effects of garlic oil and diallyl trisulfide on glycemic control in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Diabetic rats received by gavage garlic oil (100 mg/kg body weight), diallyl trisulfide (40 mg/kg body weight), or corn oil every other day for 3 weeks. Control rats received corn oil only. Both garlic compounds significantly raised the basal insulin concentration. The insulin resistance index as assessed by homeostasis model assessment and the first-order rate constant for glucose disappearance were significantly improved by both garlic compounds (P < 0.05). Oral glucose tolerance was also improved by both garlic compounds and was accompanied by a significantly increased rate of insulin secretion (P < 0.05). Glycogen formation (but not that of lactate or carbon dioxide) from glucose by the soleus muscle in the presence of 10 or 100 μU/ml of insulin was significantly better after treatment with both garlic compounds. Both garlic oil and diallyl trisulfide improve glycemic control in diabetic rats through increased insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

0029856057	Regulatory effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 lipids on plasma and hepatic lipid levels, liver cell number and microsomal protein content in spontaneously hypertensive rats	Weanling male spontaneously hypertensive rats were fed semipurified diets containing either corn or fish oil for 8 weeks. Rats fed on fish oil diet had significantly lower plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels than rats fed on corn oil diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, rats fed on fish oil diet had significantly lower liver total lipid and triglyceride concentrations than rats fed on corn oil diet (P < 0.05). Dietary lipids were reflected in plasma fatty acid composition. Rats fed on fish oil diet had significantly greater plasma eicosapentaenoate (EPA) and docosahexaenoate (DHA) (n-3 PUFAs) with an accompanying decrease in plasma linoleate (LA) and arachidonate (AA) (n-6 PUFAs), in comparison with the rats fed corn oil (P < 0.05). Those results would suggest that the n-3 PUFAs were incorporated into plasma lipids at the expense of the n-6 PUFAs. Rats fed on corn oil diet had significantly greater liver DNA content than rats fed on fish oil diet (P < 0.05), thereby implying that the n-3 PUFAs in fish oil had an inhibitory effect on liver cell proliferation. Furthermore, rats fed on fish oil diet had significantly greater hepatic microsomal protein content than rats fed on corn oil diet (P < 0.05), indicating that fish oil exerted a stimulatory effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes.

0029998041	Glutathione and glutathione-related enzyme activities of male and female rat hepatocytes under various culture conditions	The effect of culture medium on glutathione (GSH) dependent detoxification defence system of primary cultured hepatocyte from either male or female rats was studied. Intracellular reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and six GSH-related enzyme activities, including GSH peroxidase (GSH Px), GSH reductase (GSH Rd), cytosolic GSH S-transferase (cGST), microsomal GSH S-transferase (mGST), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GTP), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS), were investigated during a 6-day culture. Media free of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and with 2.5 or 10% FBS were used. Whatever the medium, there was an initial increase of intracellular GSH and GSSG, a threefold increase of GSH at day 3 and fourfold increase of GSSG at day 4, later decreasing to their original level at day 6. The activities of all six GSH-related enzymes of male and female hepatocytes remained relatively stable during the first 72h, then gradually decreased to 50-80% of initial activities. With the exception of cGST, time-course profiles of other enzyme activities were not significantly different among various media. In both sexes, higher cGST activity was maintained for cells cultured in the presence of FBS. Results of immunoblotting analysis of cytosolic GST isozymes indicate that the placental form of GST (Yp) was markedly increased after plating and the extent of increase of Yp was higher in the presence of FBS. Despite the culture medium, the level of GST isoform Ya was maintained steadily for 6 days, however, Yb was maintained during the first 3 days and then decreased. In terms of the gender difference, GSH Px and GTP activities of hepatocytes from females were significantly greater than of males over the entire culture period. Results indicate that FBS seems not to be absolutely essential in maintaining GSH level and most of the GSH-related enzyme activities in rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, GSH levels and GSH-related enzyme activities of hepatocytes from female rats were similar to those from male rats.

0030039052	The detection of S-glutathionation of hepatic carbonic anhydrase III in rats treated with paraquat or diquat	Protein S-glutathionation has been demonstrated to be one of the cellular responses under oxidative stress and may be involved in many cellular metabolisms. In this study, the effect of redox cycling bipyridylium compounds; paraquat and diquat, on this protein modification was investigated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered i.p. either paraquat at 20 or 40 mg/kg body wt, or diquat at 85 or 170 mg/kg body wt., respectively. The liver was examined at different time points for taking the measurement of the S-glutathionation of carbonic anhydrase III (CA III), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TEARS), vitamin E depletion, glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) contents. The extent of S-glutathionation of CA III was chosen as a marker and was determined by a method combining isoelectric focusing analysis with immunoblotting. Those results indicated that paraquat and diquat significantly increased the generation of TEARS and showed a time-dependent response. The significant effect on vitamin E depletion was only obtained in rats treated with a high dose of diquat for 2 h. Hepatic cellular GSSG contents did not increase but tended to decrease all of the treatments. Although oxidative damage was actually generated in liver, based on the increase of TEARS generation and vitamin E depletion, no increase of CA III S-glutathionation was observed. We propose that the reason for this observation under this circumstance is probably due to the reversible characteristic of CA III S-glutathionation, which has been demonstrated in our previous study; (Chai et al., 1991) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 384, 270-278) and named as dethiolation.

0029814180	Plasma vitamins A and E and red blood cell fatty acid profile in newborns and their mothers	Objective: In this work, we have measured the plasma vitamins A and E and red blood cell fatty acid profile in newborns and their mothers and have determined whether there are any relationships between maternal blood and cord blood for the nutrients measured. Setting: The study was performed at the Chung Shan Memorial Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. Subjects: Twenty-nine pairs of mothers and their term infants. Interventions: Maternal venous blood was collected in the first trimester and at delivery, and cord blood was collected at delivery. Plasma vitamin A and E levels were determined by high performance liquid chromatography and red blood cell fatty acid profile was estimated by gas chromatography. Results: Mothers had significantly greater plasma vitamin A and E levels and vitamin E/total lipid than their term neonates did (P < 0.05). Maternal plasma vitamin E and vitamin E/total lipid were significantly greater in the first trimester than at delivery (P < 0.05). Red blood cell phospholipid oleate and linoleate were significantly greater in maternal red blood cell than in cord blood (P < 0.05), however, stearate and arachidonate were significantly greater in the cord blood than in the maternal blood (P < 0.05). Maternal vitamin E, vitamin E/total lipid, palmitate, linoleate, arachidonate and docosahexaenoate were found positively correlated to those in their neonates (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results suggest that there is a relationship between maternal blood and cord blood for some nutrients. Therefore, the nutritional status of mothers may affect the nutritional outcome of their neonates.

0030590958	Vitamin E protection of cell morphology and protein thiols in rat hepatocytes treated with tert-butyl hydroperoxide	Effects of vitamin E on cell morphology and cellular protein thiols under oxidative stress was investigated in cultured rat hepatocytes with different vitamin E status. Hepatocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 100 μM α-tocopherol succinate for 24 h then treated with 1.5 mM t-butyI hydroperoxide (t-BH) for different time intervals. Lipid peroxidation, as determined by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, was completely inhibited over 60 min of treatment in cells incubated with α-tocopherol. The change of cell morphology, as determined by surface blebs formation, was correlated with cellular vitamin E status. Surface blebs were formed in 25.1 ± 5.2 min in the presence of α-tocopherol in contrast to 11.1 ± 2.9 min in its absence. In cells with α-tocopherol, surface blebs were induced even though lipid peroxidation was inhibited. Comparing the depletion of membrane protein thiols with t-BH treatment, twice as many (40%) thiols were lost over 60 min in the absence of α-tocopherol whereas 20% were lost in the presence of α-tocopherol. In addition, the extent of thiol modification of carbonic anhydrase III, as determined by combining isoelectric focusing analysis with immunoblotting, further demonstrated that α-tocopherol helps maintain protein thiol in the reduced state. Results indicate that vitamin E protects cell morphology and prevents the loss of protein thiols with t-BH treatment, and on cell morphology protection is associated with protein thiol rather than membrane lipids.

0030267158	Inhibition of protein thiol modification in hepatocytes isolated from rats supplemented with vitamin E under oxidative stress	This study examined the effect of vitamin E on maintaining the protein reactive thiols under oxidative stress. Hepatocytes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats fed diets containing three levels of vitamin E (0, 100 and 15,000 mg/kg) for 12 wk. Cells were isolated by collagenase perfusion and treated with 0.5 mM tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) after 24 hr in culture. Carbonic anhydrase III (CA III) having two reactive thiols that can react with GSH under oxidative stress was chosen as the study subject. CA III S glutathionation was measured by isoelectric focusing/immunoblotting. Results indicated that thiol modification of CA III was induced by t-BuOOH and the pattern of modification was dependent on the vitamin E status. With t-BuOOH treatment, CA III S-glutathionation was quickly induced and the maximum modification was achieved at 3 min in cells isolated from rats fed high levels of vitamin E; however, modification was continuously increased and reached the maximum at 9 min of vitamin E-normal or -deficient cells. Following the maximum modification, a reversion occurred (dethiolation); the rate of reversion was also related to vitamin E status. As shown by image analysis, twofold more (40 v. 20%) CA III was modified in vitamin E-deficient hepatocytes than in cells from rats fed high vitamin E. Glutathione was also abruptly converted to the oxidized state at 3 min in all cells, then gradually reverted to the reduced state. As with the dethiolation of CA III, the rate of glutathione disulfide reduction was correlated to vitamin E status. The production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances corresponded to vitamin E status as well and was significantly inhibited in cells from rats fed high vitamin E. These results suggest that vitamin E not only inhibits lipid peroxidation but also plays a role in maintaining the protein thiols under oxidative stress.

0030267176	Effect of the active principle of garlic-diallyl sulfide-on cell viability, detoxification capability and the antioxidation system of primary rat hepatocytes	The objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of various concentrations and incubation time intervals of diallyl sulfide (DAS), an active principle of garlic, on cell viability, and glutathione (GSH) concentration and its related enzymes activities in rat hepatocytes. According to the results of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and microscopic examination, 0.5 or 1 mM DAS treatment did not have any adverse effects on the viability of hepatocytes. Intracellular GSH contents of cells treated with 0.5 and 1 mM DAS (58.6 and 66.4 nmol GSH/mg protein, respectively) were higher than in the controls (54.2 nmol GSH/mg protein), around 8-23%, at 24 hr of incubation; a significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed for 1 mM DAS treatment at 48 hr. This phenomenon is beneficial to the detoxification and antioxidation capabilities of hepatocytes. Further, when the hepatocytes were treated with 0.5 or 1 mM DAS, the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRd) were almost the same as those of the controls. On the other hand, treatment with 5 mM DAS was associated with a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in cell viability, namely in increased LDH leakage (50% at 24-hr treatment), significant changes in the morphology of the hepatocytes, low intracellular GSH level (45% lower than in the controls at 24-hr treatment), and low activities of GST, GPx and Grd.

0030761083	Antioxidative protection of water extra of psoralea fruit and bakuchiol on primary rat hepatocytes	Protective effect of water extract of psoralea fruit and bakuchiol on the viability, lipid peroxidation, glutathione (GSH) levels and activities of GSH-related enzymes of primary rat hepatocytes under oxidative stress induced by glucose/glucose oxidase was investigated. Hepatocytes were incubated with or without water extract of psoralea fruit (0.6 mg/mL) or bakuchiol (0.125 mM), and 50 μg/mL glucose, 100 μg/mL glucose oxidase except for the blank. The results reveal that the lactate dehydrogenase leakage of hepatocytes incubated with water extract of psoralea fruit or bakuchiol was significantly suppressed; showing only about half that of the control at 8 hr incubation, and the protective effects lasted till 48 hr (p < 0.05). As for the lipid peroxidation of hepatocytes, water extract of psoralea fruit or bakuchiol significantly (p < 0.05) controlled the lipid peroxidation induced by glucose and glucose oxidase. On the other hand, water extract of psoralea fruit or bakuchiol helped maintain GSH and oxidized glutathione levels in hepatocytes under oxidative stress, and even induced more GSH production. Regarding the aspect of the GSH-related enzymes activities, water extract of psoralea fruit or bakuchiol stopped the activities of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S- transferase and glutathione reductase decrease what caused by oxidative stress and even to elevate the activities of them. Thus, water extract of psoralea fruit and bakuchiol protected hepatocytes from oxidation damage via increasing the GSH levels and elevating the activities of GSH-related enzymes of hepatocytes.

0030797220	Protein thiol modifications of human red blood cells treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide	Oxidative stress causes modification of cellular macromolecules and leads to cell damage. The objective of this study was to identify protein modifications that relate to thiol groups in human red blood cells under oxidative stress. With t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH) treatment, results of isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis showed that two dithiothreitol-reversible modifications are observed, one toward the cathode and the other to the anode. Protein change toward the cathode was demonstrated to be hemoglobin oxidation, which gains a net positive charge, based on the same focus on IEF gels as hemoglobin and methemoglobin and molecular weight analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Otherwise, the change toward the anode was the result of mixed disulfide formation between GSH and protein thiols. Based on the results of molecular weight analysis and its reversion from methemoglobin, protein formed mixed disulfides with GSH were also regarded as hemoglobin. As red blood samples were treated with diamide or GSSG, in addition to the mixed disulfides observed in t-BH-treated cells, additional hemoglobin-GSH mixed disulfide appeared. But the disappearance of this diamide-induced additional mixed disulfide by treating cells with t-BH after diamide treatment suggests that the increase of negative charges from GSH are offset by ferrohemoglobin oxidation to ferrihemoglobin. Additionally, other dithiothreitol-reversible modifications of one cell membrane protein, spectrin, were also observed from the formation of high molecular weight molecules as detected by SDS-PAGE. Results indicate that protein thiols in human red blood cells are susceptible to modification under oxidative stress. IEF analysis provides a useful tool to measure methemoglobin and hemoglobin-GSH mixed disulfide formation.

0030830939	Methionine and cysteine affect glutathione level, glutathione-related enzyme activities and the expression of glutathione S-transferase isozymes in rat hepatocytes	Methionine and cysteine are constituents of glutathione. To understand the effects of these two sulfur amino acids on the glutathione (GSH)- dependent detoxification defense system, intracellular GSH and GSH-related enzyme activities, including GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, GSH S-transferase (GST) and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, were determined. In addition, the expression of three GST isozymes and carbonic anhydrase III (CA III) was examined. Hepatocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 or 1.0 mmol/L each of L-methionine and L-cysteine, for up to 7 d. Cells incubated with 0.5 or 1.0 mmol/L methionine and cysteine had increased intracellular GSH. A twofold increase was observed on d 6 compared with freshly isolated hepatocytes (P < 0.05). However, intracellular GSH was lower in cells treated with 0.3 or 0.1 mmol/L each of methionine and cysteine than in cells tested with 0.5 or 1.0 mmol/L. Although the GSH level differed significantly between cells cultured with 0.3 or 1.0 mmol/L of methionine and cysteine, GSH-related enzymes did not differ at these two concentrations. The activity generally remained constant for the first 24 h, then increased up to d 4. Immunodetection analysis revealed no difference in the level of CA III and GST isoforms, Ya, Yb and Yp, with amino acids each at a concentration of at least 0.3 mmol/L. Yp expression steadily increased up to d 7. Most proteins decreased rapidly after 48 h when cultured with 0.1 mmol/L of methionine and cysteine; however, the Yp level increased up to d 6. In conclusion, results indicate that a twofold increase of intracellular GSH is reached by adding methionine and cysteine at a concentration >0.5 mmol/L to the culture medium. The concentrations of methionine and cysteine for maintaining hepatic GSH are higher than for GSH-related enzyme activity and for GST isoform expression.

0030948068	Vitamin E protection of cell morphology under oxidative stress is related to cytoskeletal proteins in rat hepatocytes	A significant change in cell morphology was observed in hepatocytes treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH). This morphological change of multiple bleb formation on cell plasma membranes was related to cell damage, and the subsequent rupture of these blebs resulted in cell death. In cells incubated with α-tocopherol before t-BH treatment, bleb formation was significantly inhibited. Using fluorescence microscopy, actin organization was shown to be related to α-tocopherol status as demonstrated by early changes in the actin network of cells in the absence of α-tocopherol. Results from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis further indicated that, under oxidative stress, actin molecules (45 kDa) decreased in amount and were accompanied by the formation of high molecular weight molecules. In the presence of the thiol reducing agent, dithiothreitol, both the decrease in monomeric actin and formation of high molecular weight molecules disappeared. The loss of actin showed a time-dependent response and could be observed after 15 min with t-BH treatment either in the presence or absence of α-tocopherol; however the extent was much more significant in cells with no α-tocopherol. Depletion of total membrane protein thiols was also related to vitamin E and was greater in cells with no α-tocopherol. The amount of cell damage, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage in cells with t-BH treatment over 120 min was decreased in the presence of α-tocopherol compared with the rapid increase of LDH leakage in the absence of α-tocopherol. These results indicate that vitamin E protection of cell morphology under oxidative stress is related to actin, with thiol groups in actin probably playing a key role.

0031713075	Effect of dietary lipid on γ-glutamyl transferase-positive foci during hepatocarcinogenesis in rats	The effect of dietary lipid on γ-glutamyl transferase-positive (GGT-positive) foci was investigated. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with diethylnitrosamine (15 mg/kg) at 24 h of age. After weaning, they were fed nutritionally complete semipurified diets for 3 months. Rats fed 15% corn oil had significantly lower hepatic phospholipid eicosapentaenoate and docosahexaenoate than rats fed 7.5% corn oil plus 7.5% fish oil, 5% corn oil plus 10% fish oil (P< 0.05). However, rats fed 15% corn oil had significantly greater hepatic phospholipid arachidonate than rats fed the other two diets (P < 0.05), suggesting that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were incorporated into hepatic phospholipid at the expense of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Hepatic PGF(2α) content was significantly greater in rats fed 15% corn oil than in rats fed the other two diets (P< 0.05). Rats fed fish oil had significantly lower hepatic vitamin E content than rats fed corn oil (P < 0.05). Hepatic lipid peroxidation (TBARS) tended to increase with increased dietary fish oil (P < 0.05). Dietary lipid did not influence GGT-positive foci area or number. In conclusion, dietary lipid affected hepatic PGF(2α) production, however, showed no effect on GGT-positive foci area and number. This may suggest that PGF(2α) is not the underlying mechanism for GGT-positive foci during hepatocarcinogenesis.

0031726923	Effect of vitamin E on rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity	Hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity has been shown to be affected by various dietary factors including vitamin E. However, reports of the effect of dietary vitamin E on cytochrome P-450 activity have been inconsistent. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of dietary vitamin E on rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity. Three groups of six male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed semipurified diets containing 0, 100, or 1,500 ppm vitamin E for eight weeks. Vitamin E was given in the form of α- tocopheryl acetate. Dietary vitamin E significantly affected liver vitamin E content (p < 0.05) but had no effect on rat hepatic total P-450 content, N- nitrosodimethylamine demethylase, and NADPH-cytochrome-P-450 reductase activities. Hepatic pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase and glutathione S- transferase activities were significantly greater in rats fed 100 and 1,500 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed no vitamin E (P < 0.05). Dietary vitamin E induced changes in hepatic phospholipid fatty acid composition. Hepatic phospholipid linoleate was significantly greater in rats fed 0 and 1,500 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed 100 ppm vitamin E (p < 0.05). Hepatic phospholipid eicosapentaenoate was increased significantly by dietary vitamin E (p < 0.05). Hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance was significantly greater in rats fed no vitamin E than in rats fed 100 and 1,500 ppm vitamin E (p < 0.05). The results suggest that vitamin E may influence cytochrome P- 450 HBI enzyme activity and may affect hepatic phospholipid fatty acid composition.

0031742611	α-Tocopherol acetate supplementation enhances rat hepatic cytochrome PROD activity in the presence of phenobarbital induction	Hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzymes play important roles in bioactivation of chemical carcinogens, biotransformation of many endogenous compounds, and detoxification of numerous xenobiotics. These enzyme activities have been shown to be regulated by various dietary factors. In our previous study, hepatic cytochrome pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity was decreased in rats fed an α-tocopherol acetate-deficient diet compared with rats fed α-tocopherol acetate-adequate or -supplemented diets. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether the modulatory effect of dietary α-tocopherol acetate on hepatic cytochrome PROD activity is influenced by the presence of phenobarbital. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed the AIN-76 diet for four days, fasted for two days, then fed semipurified diets that were α-tocopherol acetate deficient, adequate, or supplemented with 5 and 15 g/kg α-tocopherol acetate for four days. Liver and plasma α-tocopherol concentrations were dose dependently regulated by dietary α-tocopherol acetate level. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation by dietary α-tocopherol acetate was dose dependent. Hepatic total cytochrome P- 450 content was significantly greater in rats fed diets supplemented with 5 and 15 g/kg α-tocopherol acetate than in rats fed an α-tocopherol-adequate diet (p < 0.05). Hepatic cytochrome PROD activity was significantly greater in rats fed diets supplemented with 5 and 15 g/kg α-tocopherol acetate than in rats fed α-tocopherol acetate-deficient and -adequate diets (p < 0.05). These results suggest that, in the presence of phenobarbital, dietary α- tocopherol acetate efficiently affects tissue α-tocopherol levels and inhibits lipid peroxidation and that diets supplemented with 5 or 15 g/kg α- tocopherol acetate enhance hepatic cytochrome PROD activity compared with α- tocopherol acetate-deficient or -adequate diets.

0031445127	Amount and type of dietary lipid modulate rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 activity	The influence of the amount and type of dietary lipid on rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 activities in the presence and absence of inducer administration was investigated. Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed fat-free or 20% beef tallow, olive oil, corn oil, linseed oil, or menhaden oil diets in combination with one of the following three treatments: no inducer, intraperitoneal injection of phenobarbital (75 mg/kg body wt) for three consecutive days before they were killed, or intragastric administration of acetone (5 ml/kg) one day before they were killed. Twenty percent linseed oil and menhaden oil diets induced the highest level of activity among the different fat types in the presence of phenobarbital and acetone. Cytochrome P-450IIB1 activity was induced to a significantly greater extent by acetone administration in conjunction with the 20% menhaden oil diet than in conjunction with the other dietary oils (p < 0.05). In the presence of acetone, 20% beef tallow, 20% linseed oil, and 20% menhaden oil diets significantly induced cytochrome P-450IIE1 activity compared with the fat-free diet (p < 0.05). In conclusion, cytochrome P-450IIB1 and P-450IIE1 activities in rats were significantly increased by specific inducers, and dietary lipid was necessary for this effect. Diets supplemented with linseed and menhaden oils were most effective in inducing this activity.

0032416487	Effect of dietary vitamin E on antioxidant status and antioxidant enzyme activities in Sprague-Dawley rats	The effect of dietary vitamin E on plasma, red blood cells (RBC), hepatic antioxidant status, and antioxidant enzyme activities was investigated. Three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were fed 0, 100, or 1,500 ppm vitamin E for eight weeks. Plasma α-tocopherol level was increased significantly by increasing dietary vitamin E (p < 0.05). Plasma lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) stimulation by 1 mM t- butyl hydroperoxide was correlated with dietary vitamin E level and was significantly greater in rats fed no vitamin E than in rats fed 100 or 1,500 ppm vitamin E (p < 0.05). RBC reduced glutathione (GSH) level was positively correlated with dietary vitamin E and was significantly greater in rats fed 1,500 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed 0 or 100 ppm vitamin E (p < 0.05). RBC oxidized glutathione was negatively correlated with dietary vitamin E. GSH redox status was expressed as the GSH-to-total GSH ratio; the ratio was also positively correlated with dietary vitamin E and was significantly greater in rats fed 1,500 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed no vitamin E (p < 0.05). For antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase activity in hepatic cytosolic fraction was significantly greater in rats fed 1,500 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed 100 ppm vitamin E. Hepatic GSH reductase activity was significantly greater in rats fed 100 ppm vitamin E than in rats fed no vitamin E (p < 0.05). Dietary vitamin E had no effect on plasma vitamin C and protein thiol levels. In the systems studied, results indicated that dietary vitamin E selectively influences plasma vitamin E level, RBC GSH status, and hepatic cytosolic superoxide dismutase and GSH reductase activities.

0032421478	Alterations of small-molecular-weight antioxidants in the blood of smokers	Plasma α-tocopherol, ascorbate, retinol, uric acid, and lipid peroxides were investigated in 39 male smokers and 64 male non-smokers. The average level of plasma α-tocopherol of 35-45-year-old smokers (1.74±0.49 μg/mg total lipid) was significantly lower than that of age-matched non-smokers (2.55±0.88 μg/mg total lipid, P=0.032). Similarly, the plasma α-tocopherol of smokers aged above 45 (1.66±0.29 μg/mg total lipid) was lower than that of the age-matched non-smokers (2.38±1.26 μg/mg total lipid, P=0.014). However, no difference in plasma level of α-tocopherol was found between smokers and non-smokers below the age of 35. The average concentration of ascorbate in plasma was significantly decreased only in those smokers older than 45 (0.33±0.16 mg/dl vs non-smokers 0.53±0.19 mg/dl, P=0.003). The average level of lipid peroxides (measured as malondialdehyde, MDA) in the plasma of smokers (2.77±0.51 nmol/ml) was higher than that of non-smokers (2.35±0.21 nmol/ml) aged above 45 (P=0.034). No differences in the plasma levels of uric acid and retinol were noted between smokers and non-smokers in all age groups. Using partial correlation analysis under age control, we found that the plasma level of α-tocopherol was negatively correlated with the plasma level of MDA (r=-0.523, P=0.038). In contrast, the plasma level of ascorbate was only weakly correlated with the plasma level of MDA (r=-0.341, P=0.094). Moreover, we found a negative correlation between the plasma level of α-tocopherol and smoking index (r=-0.414, P=0.006) under age control, but there was no correlation between plasma level of ascorbate and smoking index (r=0.221, P=0.193). These results indicate that adequate levels of α-tocopherol and ascorbate may protect the plasma from oxidative damage elicited by smoking-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals in young smokers. However, the antioxidant activities of α-tocopherol and ascorbate may be overwhelmed by the long-standing oxidative stress elicited by cigarette smoking in elderly subjects.

0032601866	Effect of garlic active principle, diallyl disulfide, on cell viability, lipid peroxidation, glutathione concentration and its related enzyme activities in primary rat hepatocytes	This study investigated the effects of various concentrations and incubation time intervals of diallyl disulfide (DADS), the active principle of garlic, on: 1. cell viability, 2. lipid peroxidation. and 3. glutathione (GSH) concentration and its related enzyme activities of rat hepatocytes. According to the results of LDH leakage and microscopic examination, 0.5 and 1 mM DADS did not significantly affect the viability of hepatocytes. However, significant decrease in cell viability according to increased LDH leakage and significant changes in morphology of hepatocytes were observed at 2 mM DADS (P<0.05). Lipid peroxidation was also detected when the hepatocytes were treated with 2 mM DADS. At 0.5 mM DADS, a higher GSH content was found in the hepatocytes although not at a statistically significant level. 0.5 and 1 mM DADS has little effect on the activities of glutathione-Stransferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx); however a significant decrease in GST, GPx and glutathione reductase (GRd) activities was observed at 2 mM DADS. Once the media of 2 mM DADS was replaced with fresh medium at 24 hr treatment, the activities of GST, GRd and GPx were recovered, although they were still lower than the control values. © 1999 Institute for Advanced Research in Asian Scsience and Medicine.

2442442014	Protective Effect of Water Yam (Dioscorea alata L.) Extract on the Copper-driven Fenton Reaction and X-ray Induced DNA Damage in vitro	The rhizome extract of Dioscorea has been shown to possess radical scavenging activity. In this study, the protective effect of water yam (Dioscorea alata L.) rhizome extract on calf thymus DNA and plasmid DNA strand breakage by the copper-driven Fenton reaction and X-irradiation was examined. The protective activity in vitro of four lyophilized extracts obtained from yam rhizomes: (1) aqueous extract (YAE); (2) 30% ethanolic extract (YEE); (3) aqueous extract boiled for 30 min (BYAE); and (4) 30% ethanolic extract boiled for 30 min (BYEE) were evaluated by ethidium bromide binding assay and DNA nicking assay. The YAE, YEE, and BYEE effectively inhibited the copper-driven Fenton reaction-induced damage of calf thymus DNA, while inhibition was less pronounced in the case of X-ray induced strand breakage of plasmid DNA. While BYAE potently inhibited X-ray induced strand breaks in plasmid pGL3 DNA, it failed to inhibit, and even greatly enhanced copper-H

26844477964	Contribution of plasma folic acid and homocysteine levels to the mean carotid intima media thickness in smokers	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of smoking on the atherosclerotic risk indicators, the independent risk factors for the plasma homocysteine, and for the mean carotid intima media thickness (mIMT) in the smoker and nonsmoker groups. A total of 213 male subjects, consisting of 96 smokers and 117 nonsmokers, were recruited. Smokers had significantly greater plasma triglyceride level (P = .016) and significantly lower plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (P = .004) than did nonsmokers. The mIMT and plasma homocysteine level of the smokers were significantly greater than those of the nonsmokers (P = .001 and P = .044, respectively). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the plasma folic acid concentration was a significant contributor to the plasma homocysteine level in the smoker group (P = .018), and age was a significant contributor to the plasma homocysteine level in the nonsmoker group (P = .024). Age is a significant contributor to the mIMT in both groups (P = .001), and plasma homocysteine level contributed significantly to the mIMT in the smoker group (P = .001). These data suggest that low plasma folic acid status contributed to the high-normal homocysteinemia found in smoker subjects, and this might partially explain the increased mIMT observed in the smoker group. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

28844491801	Contribution of conjugated linoleic acid to the suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and transcription factor activation in stimulated mouse mesangial cells	That both infiltrating macrophages and resident mesangial cells express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and produce nitric oxide (NO) excessively is crucial to the progress of glomerulonephritis. Although several reports have mentioned the protective impacts of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in stimulated macrophages, the role of CLA in glomerular mesangial cells is unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the ability of CLA to regulate iNOS expression and NO production in stimulated glomerular mesangial cells. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of CLA on activation of transcription factors which mediate iNOS expression. Exogenous CLA dose-dependently diminished iNOS mRNA and protein expression as well as NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-stimulated SV-40-transformed mouse mesangial cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments demonstrated that CLA (100 μM) dramatically reduced activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) induced by LPS/IFN-γ. Moreover, addition of 100 μM CLA significantly diminished LPS-IFN-γ-induced protein degradation of inhibitor κB-α (IκB-α) and the protein expression of phosphorylated IκB-α in the cytosolic fraction as well as nuclear p65 expression (P < 0.05). In summary, inhibition of NF-κB, AP-1 and CREB activation by CLA may be associated with the molecular basis for which CLA suppresses iNOS expression and NO production in stimulated mesangial cells. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

2942623886	α-Tocopherol is important to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation in smokers	Smoking is recognized as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. This study was designed to study the effect of smoking on plasma and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) antioxidant concentrations and LDL oxidation susceptibility. A total of 89 subjects, consisting of 27 smokers and 62 nonsmokers, were recruited. Biochemical values and plasma ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, and LDL α-tocopherol levels were assessed. LDL lag time, oxidation rate, and correlation between LDL α-tocopherol and LDL oxidation rate were determined. No differences were demonstrated for ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol concentrations in plasma between smokers and nonsmokers; however, LDL α-tocopherol was significantly higher for nonsmokers (P = 0.012). Furthermore, the lag time for LDL oxidation was significantly longer for nonsmokers (P = 0.019), whereas the LDL oxidation rate was significantly greater for smokers (P = 0.018). Additionally, a highly significant negative correlation was demonstrated for LDL α-tocopherol concentration and LDL oxidation rate in smokers (r = -0.440, P = 0.026), but not in nonsmokers. The results of this study suggest that LDL α-tocopherol is more susceptible to oxidative stress caused by smoking than ascorbic acid and α-tocopherol in plasma. For smokers, the presence of α-tocopherol in LDL effectively protects LDL from oxidation. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

31544448252	Garlic organosulfur compounds upregulate the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase in rat primary hepatocytes	The chemopreventive property of garlic is related in part to its induction of phase II detoxification enzymes. In the present study, we investigated the modulatory effect of 3 garlic organosulfur compounds, i.e., diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), which differ in their number of sulfur atoms, on the gene expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP). Hepatocytes isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured with 50-200 μmol/L of DAS, DADS, or DATS for 24 h. DADS and DATS increased GST activity toward ethacrynic acid by 40 and 66%, respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, both garlic allyl sulfides dose dependently induced GSTP mRNA and protein expression. DATS increased the protein level more than DADS (P < 0.05). In contrast, DAS did not affect the activity or the protein or mRNA levels of this phase II drug-metabolizing enzyme. In Clone 9 liver cells, the pTA-luciferase reporter assay showed that luciferase activity in DADS- and DATS-treated cells was 2.8- and 3.9-fold higher than that in control cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Again, luciferase activity was not affected by treatment with DAS. Deletion of -2.7 to -2.6 kb in the GSTP promoter region, which contains the GSTP enhancer (GPE) I element, abolished the upregulation of GSTP transcription by DADS and DATS. Deletion of GPE II, however, did not affect the induction of reporter activity. In conclusion, the effectiveness of 3 garlic allyl sulfides on GSTP expression was related to the number of sulfur atoms in the molecules, and GPE I was responsible for this upregulation. © 2005 American Society for Nutrition.

33646121258	Effects of garlic oil and two of its major organosulfur compounds, diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide, on intestinal damage in rats injected with endotoxin	Garlic and its active components are known to possess antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects. The present study investigated the effects of garlic oil and its organosulfur compounds on endotoxin-induced intestinal mucosal damage. Wistar rats received by gavage 50 or 200 mg/kg body weight garlic oil (GO), 0.5 mmol/kg body weight diallyl disulfide or diallyl trisulfide, or the vehicle (corn oil; 2 ml/kg body weight) every other day for 2 weeks before being injected with endotoxin (i.p., 5 mg/kg body weight). Control rats were administered with corn oil and were injected with sterile saline. Samples for the measurement of proinflammatory cytokines were collected 3 h after injection, and all other samples were collected 18 h after injection. The low dose of GO suppressed endotoxin-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, ulceration, and apoptosis in the intestinal mucosa (P < 0.05). The high dose of GO significantly lowered the peripheral level of nitrate/nitrite and endotoxin-induced iNOS activity in the intestinal mucosa (P < 0.05) but worsened intestinal mucosal damage accompanied by elevated peripheral proinflammatory cytokines. Diallyl trisulfide but not diallyl disulfide showed similar toxic effect as that of high-dose GO. These results suggest the preventive effect and possible toxicity of garlic oil and its organosulfur compounds in endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation and intestinal damage. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

33744459527	DATS reduces LPS-induced iNOS expression, NO production, oxidative stress, and NF-κB activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages	Diallyl trisulfide (DATS), diallyl sulfide (DAS), and diallyl disulfide (DADS) are the three major organosulfur compounds (OSCs) in garlic oil. In contrast to DADS and DATS, evidence of an anti-inflammatory effect of DATS is limited. In this study compares the efficacy of DATS with those of DAS and DADS on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The NO production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages was suppressed by both DADS and DATS in a dose-dependent manner. At 100 μM, the nitrite levels of DADS- and DATS-treated cells were 57 and 34%, respectively, of cells treated with LPS alone. DAS, however, had no influence on NO production even at a concentration of 1 mM. Western blot and Northern blot assays showed that DADS and DATS but not DAS dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced iNOS protein and mRNA expression in a pattern similar to that noted for NO production. LPS-induced cellular peroxide production was significantly inhibited by DADS and DATS (P < 0.05) but not by DAS. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays further indicated that DADS and DATS effectively inhibited the activation of NF-κB induced by LPS. Taken together, these results indicate that the differential efficacy of three major OSCs of garlic oil on suppression of iNOS expression and NO production is related to the number of sulfur atoms and is in the order DATS > DADS > DAS. The inhibitory effect of DATS on LPS-induced iNOS expression is likely attributed to its antioxidant potential to inhibit NF-κB activation. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33746559210	Garlic allyl sulfides display differential modulation of rat cytochrome P450 2B1 and the placental form glutathione S-transferase in various organs	To investigate whether the regulation of garlic allyl sulfides on biotransformation enzyme expression is tissue-specific, the expression of cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP 2B1) and the placental form of glutathione S-transferase (PGST) in liver, lung, and intestine, which are the three major organs responsible for drug metabolism, was examined. Rats were orally administrated 0.5 or 2 mmol/kg BW diallyl sulfide (DAS) or 0.5 mmol/kg BW diallyl disulfide (DADS) or diallyl trisulfide (DATS) three times per week for 6 weeks. The final body weights and the body weight ratio of liver and lung were not changed by any of these three allyl sulfide treatments as compared to the control rats. An 11-and 12-fold increase of 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activities was noted in rats treated with 0.5 or 2 mmol/mg BW DAS, respectively, as compared with the controls (P < 0.05). In contrast, DADS and DATS significantly increased hepatic PGST activity toward ethacrynic acid by 30 and 40%, respectively, as compared with the control rats (P < 0.05). An increase in PGST activity was only noted at 2 mmol/kg BW DAS group (P < 0.05). In addition, similar increases in PGST activity due to DADS and DATS were also noted in lung and jejunum tissue (P < 0.05). Immunoblot assay shows that the changes in CYP 2B1 and PGST proteins due to the three garlic allyl sulfide treatments on liver, lung, and jejunum were consistent with those observed for PROD and PGST activities. Northern blot further revealed that the DADS and DATS increased PGST mRNA levels in both liver (2.9- and 3.0-fold, respectively) and lung (4.1- and 2.6-fold, respectively) and DAS dose-dependently increased CYP 2B1 mRNA levels in the liver. Garlic allyl sulfides differentially induced CYP 2B1 and PGST expression, and this up-regulation of these two biotransformation enzymes is tissue-specific. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33748611622	n-6 and n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids down-regulate cytochrome P-450 2B1 gene expression induced by phenobarbital in primary rat hepatocytes	In mammals, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) act not only as an important energy source, but also as substrates for cellular membrane and hormone formation. They also play key roles in cellular metabolism and gene regulation. The objective of the present study was to determine whether individual n-6 and n-3 PUFAs affect cytochrome P-450 2B1 (CYP 2B1) expression induced by phenobarbital (PB) in primary rat hepatocytes. We used 100-μM arachidonic acid (AA), linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to test this hypothesis.

33746910604	Antidiabetic effect of garlic oil but not diallyl disulfide in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes	We investigated the effects of garlic oil and diallyl disulfide (DADS) on glycemic control and renal function in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Rats received by gavage garlic oil (100 mg/kg body wt) or DADS (40 or 80 mg/kg body wt) every other day until 16 weeks after the induction of diabetes. The control rats were treated with corn oil only. Neither garlic oil nor DADS significantly affected fasting blood glucose concentrations throughout the investigation period. Garlic oil did not affect oral glucose tolerance in diabetes acutely but significantly improved oral glucose tolerance at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and significantly ameliorated proteinuria at the end of 16 weeks. DADS did not significantly affect oral glucose tolerance or renal function. Diabetic rats fed 80 mg DADS/kg body wt had a significantly lower rate of body weight gain and a significantly lower ratio of muscle weight to body weight than did vehicle-treated diabetic rats. In conclusion, long-term treatment of diabetes with garlic oil can improve oral glucose tolerance and renal function in diabetes but not through the action of DADS. High doses of DADS may further complicate the metabolic disturbances in diabetes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34547651274	Anti-Fenton reaction activity of three taxa of water yam (Dioscorea alata L.)	In the present study, we compared the anti-Fenton reaction activity of three taxa of water yam (Dioscorea alata L.): DS2, TN2 and PSY [D. alata L. var. purpurea (Roxb.) M. Pouch]. Anti-Fenton reaction activity was evaluated by measuring the damage inflicted on calf thymus DNA by copper ions combined with hydrogen peroxide with the use of an ethidium bromide binding assay and agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that extracts of tuber pulp from all three taxa of yam had significant anti-Fenton reaction activity. The protection pattern of the three tuber pulp extracts was similar to that of EDTA, a typical divalent metal ion chelator, which displayed a significant protection lag-phase. With the use of thin-layer chromatography, we found that a common, major ansialdehyde-sulphuric acid stained spot (possibly a polysaccharide mucilage) with an Rf of 0.09 may be the most likely contributor to the anti-Fenton reaction activities of the yam tuber extracts investigated. The present study identifies the mechanism of the health benefit of the Dioscorea family. The copper-chelating and absorbing capability of yam tuber pulp extracts may be useful in functional screening. © 2007 The Authors.

36448950841	DHA down-regulates phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P450 2B1 gene expression in rat primary hepatocytes by attenuating CAR translocation	The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) plays an important role in regulating the expression of detoxifying enzymes, including cytochrome P450 2B (CYP 2B). Phenobarbital (PB) induction of human CYP 2B6 and mouse CYP 2b10 has been shown to be mediated by CAR. Our previous study showed that PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression in rat primary hepatocytes is down-regulated by both n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, the mechanism for this down-regulation by DHA was previously unknown. The objective of the present study was to determine whether change in CAR translocation is involved in the down-regulation by n-6 and n-3 PUFAs of PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression in rat primary hepatocytes. We used 100 μM arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and DHA to test this hypothesis. PB triggered the translocation of CAR from the cytosol into the nucleus in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in our hepatocyte system, and the CAR distribution in rat primary hepatocytes was significantly affected by DHA. DHA treatment decreased PB-inducible accumulation of CAR in the nuclear fraction and increased it in the cytosolic fraction in a dose-dependent manner. The down-regulation of CYP 2B1 expression by DHA occurred in a dose-dependent manner, and a similar pattern was found for the nuclear accumulation of CAR. The results of immunoprecipitation showed a CAR/RXR heterodimer bound to nuclear receptor binding site 1 (NR-1) of the PB-responsive enhancer module (PBREM) of the CYP 2B1gene. The EMSA results showed that PB-induced CAR binding to NR-1 was attenuated by DHA. Taken together, these results suggest that attenuation of CAR translocation and decreased subsequent binding to NR-1 are involved in DHA's down-regulation of PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

36649035056	Does garlic have a role as an antidiabetic agent?	Diabetes affects a large segment of the population worldwide, and the prevalence of this disease is rapidly increasing. Despite the availability of medication for diabetes, traditional remedies are desirable and are currently being investigated. Garlic (Allium sativum), which is a common cooking spice and has a long history as a folk remedy, has been reported to have antidiabetic activity. However, there is no general agreement on the use of garlic for antidiabetic purposes, primarily because of a lack of scientific evidence from human studies and inconsistent data from animal studies. The validity of data from previous studies of the hypoglycemic effect of garlic in diabetic animals and the preventive effects of garlic on diabetes complications are discussed in this review. The role of garlic as both an insulin secretagogue and as an insulin sensitizer is reviewed. Evidence suggests that garlic's antioxidative, antiinflammatory, and antiglycative properties are responsible for garlic's role in preventing diabetes progression and the development of diabetes-related complications. Large-scale clinical studies with diabetic patients are warranted to confirm the usefulness of garlic in the treatment and prevention of diabetes. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.

0033373631	Metabolites of diallyl disulfide and diallyl sulfide in primary rat hepatocytes	The objectives of this study were to analyse and identify the metabolites of diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl sulfide (DAS) in primary rat hepatocytes prepared by collagenase perfusion. According to the results, allyl mercaptan (AM) and allyl methyl sulfide (AMS) were the metabolites of DADS. The highest amount of AMS (0.93 ± 0.08μg/ml at 90min) was much less than that of AM (46.2 ± 6.6μg/ml at 60min). Combined with the Purge and Trap using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system, it is very useful to detect the trace amounts of metabolites in primary rat hepatocytes. Results also showed that AMS was a metabolite of DAS. The highest amount of AMS in the extracellular fluid of hepatocytes was 0.63±0.16μg/ml at 30min of incubation.

Groups of eight rats were initiated with DEN (15 mg/kg) at 24 hours of age.

0033500043	Effects of garlic oil and its organosulfur compounds on the activities of hepatic drug-metabolizing and antioxidant enzymes in rats fed high- and low-fat diets	We examined the effects of garlic oil (GO) and two of its organosulfur compounds, diallyl sulfide (DAS) and diallyl disulfide (DADS), on the drug- metabolizing and antioxidant systems in rats and sought to determine whether these effects are associated with dietary fat. Rats were fed a high-fat diet and received GO or DADS (200 mg/kg body wt) or DAS (100 mg/kg) orally three times a week for seven weeks. Control animals received corn oil alone. Another group of rats was fed a low-fat diet, with or without GO. GO and DADS significantly reduced the body weight gain of rats (p <0.05). GO, however, dramatically increased the spleen weight and spleen weight-to-body weight ratio (p < 0.05). DAS increased glutathione S-transferase (GST) and 7- pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activities, whereas DADS increased only GST activity (p<0.05). Immunoblot assay showed GO-, DAS-, and DADS-enhanced expression of the placental form of GST and cytochrome P-450 IIBI but suppressed cytochrome P-450 IIEI expression. Hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities were also modulated by these garlic components. GO and DADS inhibited glutathione peroxidase activity (p<0.05), and DADS and DAS enhanced glutathione reductase activity (p<0.05). Only GO enhanced the superoxide dismutase activity (p<0.05). All these garlic components increased glutathione levels in red blood cells (p<0.05) but did not influence hepatic glutathione levels. Although the amount of fat in the diet modulated drug- metabolizing and antioxidant functions, no interactions between GO and dietary fat were observed. These results indicate that GO and its allyl sulfide components, as well as dietary lipid, modulate drug-metabolizing and antioxidant enzyme activities. The action of GO appears to be independent of dietary lipid content.

0032959663	Chemical composition and toxicity of Taiwanese betel quid extract	In this genotoxic study, the Ames Salmonella microsome test showed that an aqueous extract of betel quid did not induce mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100. Mammalian cell studies (Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell; CHO-K1 cell) revealed that only higher concentrations (100 and 1000μg/ml) of aqueous extract weekly increased the frequencies of sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) in the absence of S9. Animal (male Sprague-Dawley rat) studies showed that low-dose feeding (0.53g dry aqueous extract/kg diet) significantly increased the activities of glutathione (GSH) peroxidase and cytoplasmic glutathione S-transferase (cGST) of liver, high-dose feeding (26.5g dry aqueous extract/kg diet) lowered the contents of GSH and total glutathione. The effect of an aqueous extract of betel quid on the oxidation of 2'-deoxyguanosine (2'-dG) to 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) evaluated that this aqueous extract may act as a pro-oxidant at lower dosage and may be dependent on the iron ions in the model system. However, the aqueous extract of betel quid showed antioxidant activity at higher doses by the ability of the scavenging effect of the hydroxyl radicals. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

0033795435	Inhibition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced cell membrane bleb formation by α-tocopherol and glutathione	Multiple bleb formation on cell membrane is common during cell death. The effects of α-tocopherol and glutathione (GSH) on tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH)-induced membrane changes in rat hepatocytes were studied. Over 60 min of exposure, TBH (0.5-2.0 mM) caused a dose-dependent membrane blebbing. Cells pretreated with buthionine sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, had significantly greater blebbing and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage under 0.5 mM TBH treatment as compared to cells without pretreatment. However, the protective effect of GSH disappeared when the TBH concentration was increased to 2.0 mM. In the presence of α-tocopheryl succinate (TS) pretreatment, it was noted that bleb formation, expressed as the percentage of cells bearing blebs, the average bleb size, or the onset of blebbing, was partially suppressed even when TBH concentration was 2.0 mM. TBH-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and LDH leakage were completely abolished by TS pretreatment. Accompanying bleb formation, membrane-insoluble actin was noted to decrease by immunoblot assay . The decrease in actin was also suppressed by TS. These results indicated that intracellular GSH and α-tocopherol status are important to the TBH-induced cell membrane abnormality. Furthermore, TS plays a defensive role against blebbing when GSH is exhausted by TBH. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0033799729	Comparison of the effect of fish oil and corn oil on chemical-induced hepatic enzyme-altered foci in rats	The effects of fish oil and corn oil diets on diethylnitrosamine initiation/phenobarbital promotion of hepatic enzyme-altered foci in female Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated. Groups of 12 rats were initiated with diethylnitrosamine (15 mg/kg) at 24 h of age. After weaning, they received diets containing either 13.5% fish oil plus 1.5% corn oil or 15% corn oil for 24 weeks. Rats fed fish oil had significantly greater liver weight, relative liver weight, spleen weight, and relative spleen weight than rats fed corn oil (p < 0.05). Hepatic phospholipid fatty-acid profile was significantly affected by the type of dietary lipid. The rats fed fish oil had significantly greater hepatic phospholipid 20:5 and 22:6 than rats fed corn oil; in contrast, the rats fed corn oil had significantly greater hepatic phospholipid 18:2 and 20:4 than rats fed fish oil (p < 0.05). Rats fed fish oil had significantly lower hepatic vitamin E and PGE

38649140692	Modulation of the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase by Andrographis paniculata extracts and andrographolide	Andrographis paniculata (Ap) is a commonly used herb for traditional medicine in many Southeast Asian countries. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Ap on the expression of the pi class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) in rat primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with 25 or 50 μg/mL of ethanol or ethyl acetate extracts of Ap (ApEE or ApEAE) or 10 or 20 μM andrographolide, which is the major active diterpene lactone of Ap, for 48 h. ApEE, ApEAE, and andrographolide dose-dependently induced GSTP protein and mRNA expression. In a GST activity assay, GST activity was significantly higher in cells treated with the maximum concentrations of ApEE, ApEAE, and andrographolide than in control cells (P < 0.05). The pTA-2713 luciferase reporter construct containing rat GSTP enhancer 1 (GPE1) was transiently transfected into Clone 9 liver cells. Cells treated with ApEE, ApEAE, and andrographolide showed a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity. GPE1 deletion abolished the induction efficiency of Ap. Also, the induction of GSTP expression by Ap was inhibited by wortmannin, which is an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. These results indicate that ApEE, ApEAE, and andrographolide induce GSTP expression. This induction is likely related to the PI3K/Akt pathway, and GPE1, an enhancer element in GSTP promoter, is essential for the induction. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

34247586780	Inhibitory effects of the water yam (Dioscorea alata L.) on glucose-induced protein glycation: A comparative study with four Chinese medicines for treating diabetes	Diabetes is one of the five leading causes of death in Taiwan. Diabetic hyperglycemia leads to protein glycation and oxidative stress in cells and tissues, and these have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Therefore, exploring natural compounds that possess both antioxidant and antiglycation activities might have great therapeutic potential for treating diabetic complications. The object of this study was to evaluate the antiglycating and antioxidant properties of extracts from edible Shan-Yao (water yam; Dioscorea alata L.) tubers and several other traditional Chinese herbs used to treat diabetes, including Fu-Ling, Tian-Hua-Fen, Huang-Chi, and Ze-Xie by thermal glycation of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and an in vitro free radical-scavenging assay. The results showed that the water extracts of Shan-Yao, Tian-Hua-Fen, Huang-Chi, and Ze-Xie caused a significant decrease in the thermal glycation of BSA by glucose, with the extract from Tian-Hua-Fen being the most effective. The extract of Fu-Ling markedly enhanced the level of thermal glycation of BSA by glucose. The total phenolic concentration was strongly correlated with the antiglycation activity (r = 0.93 p < 0.05) and with the free radical-scavenging activity (r = 0.98 p < 0.01 ). The antiglycation activities of Shan-Yao, Tian-Hua-Fen, Huang-Chi, and Ze-Xie were consistent with their phenolic contents and free radical-scavenging activities. Again the lowest content of phenolics and free radical-scavenging activity were found in the extract of Fu-Ling. Our study results suggest that water extracts from Shan-Yao, Tian-Hua-Fen, Huang-Chi, and Ze-Xie, especially Tian-Hua-Fen, may offer therapeutic potential in protection against diabetic complications due to their combined antiglycation and antioxidant properties.

34247855058	Diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide up-regulate the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase via an AP-1 -dependent pathway	Garlic organosulfur compounds are recognized as potential chemopreventive compounds. This protection is related to the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes. We previously reported that diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) up-regulate the gene expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) and that an enhancer element named GPE I is required for this induction. In the present study, we further investigated the signal pathway involved in DADS and DATS up-regulation of this detoxification enzyme in Clone 9 cells. Cells were cultured with 25 - 200 μmol/L of DADS or DATS for 24 h. Western and Northern blots showed that both garlic allyl sulfides concentration dependency induced GSTP protein and mRNA expression, respectively. Changes in GST activity toward ethacrynic acid were consistent with the increase in GSTP expression (P < 0.05). Electromobility gel shift assay showed that the DNA binding activity of nuclear activator protein-1 (AP-1) is concentration-dependently increased in the presence of DADS and DATS as compared with that of the control cells. The phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not of p38, was stimulated in the presence of both garlic allyl sulfides. Pretreatment with SP600125 and PD98059, which are JNK and ERK inhibitors, respectively, abolished the increase in AP-1-DNA binding activity and also the induction of GSTP protein by either allyl sulfide. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of DADS and DATS on GSTP expression is likely related to the JNK-AP-1 and ERK-AP-1 signaling pathways and, thus, that DADS and DATS enhance the binding of AP-1 to GPE I. © 2007 American Chemical Society.

0034879232	Synergistic effects of nicotine on arecoline-induced cytotoxicity in human buccal mucosal fibroblasts	Areca quid chewing has been linked to oral submucous fibrosis and oral cancer. Arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, is considered to be the most important etiologic factor in the areca nut. In order to elucidate the pathobiological effects of arecoline, cytotoxicity assays, cellular glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and lipid peroxidation assay were employed to investigate cultured human buccal mucosal fibroblasts. To date, there is a large proportion of areca quid chewers who are also smokers. Furthermore, nicotine, the major product of cigarette smoking, was added to test how it modulated the cytotoxicity of arecoline. At a concentration higher than 50 μg/ml, arecoline was shown to be cytotoxic to human buccal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner by the alamar blue dye colorimetric assay (P<0.05). In addition, arecoline significantly decreased GST activity in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). At concentrations of 100 μg/ml and 400 μg/ml, arecoline reduced GST activity about 21% and 46%, respectively, during a 24 h incubation period. However, arecoline at any test dose did not increase lipid peroxidation in the present human buccal fibroblast test system. The addition of extracellular nicotine acted synergistically on the arecoline-induced cytotoxicity. Arecoline at a concentration of 50 μg/ml caused about 30% of cell death over the 24 h incubation period. However, 2.5 mM nicotine enhanced the cytotoxic response and caused about 50% of cell death on 50 μg/ml arecoline-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, arecoline may render human buccal mucosal fibroblasts more vulnerable to other reactive agents in cigarettes via GST reduction. The compounds of tobacco products may act synergistically in the pathogenesis of oral mucosal lesions in areca quid chewers. The data presented here may partly explain why patients who combined the habits of areca quid chewing and cigarette smoking are at greater risk of contracting oral cancer.

0034600762	Autoantibody against oxidized low-density lipoproteins may be enhanced by cigarette smoking	A total of 59 healthy male subjects (32 smokers and 27 nonsmokers) who had no reported systemic disease and did not take alcohol and vitamin supplementation were included. The levels of autoantibody to oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) in smokers and age-matched nonsmokers were compared. The plasma levels of antioxidants that can affect the formation of ox-LDL were also measured, and correlation analyses between anti ox-LDL IgG and plasma antioxidants, controlling for age and body mass index (BMI), were performed. Plasma α-tocopherol and uric acid concentrations of nonsmokers (2.78±1.09 μg/mg total lipid and 6.96±1.69 mg/dl, respectively) were significantly higher than those of smokers (1.68±0.48 μg/mg total lipid and 6.15±1.14 mg/dl, respectively) (P<0.05). Although plasma ascorbate and retinol levels were not significantly different between smokers and nonsmokers, smokers older than 45 years old had significantly lower plasma ascorbate levels (0.32±0.17 mg/dl) than age-matched nonsmokers (0.53±0.14 mg/dl) (P=0.036). Higher level of plasma anti ox-LDL IgG was noted in the group of smokers compared with nonsmokers (515±409 mU/ml vs. 407±268 mU/ml, respectively) under the statistic method of Chi-Square test (P=0.049). A significant negative correlation was found between plasma anti ox-LDL IgG and α-tocopherol in the combined population as well as in the smoker group (r=-0.26, p=0.047; r=-0.48, p=0.006; respectively). However, there was no correlation between plasma anti ox-LDL IgG and the levels of other antioxidants. These results suggest that reduced concentrations of α-tocopherol are associated with cigarette smoking. The significantly negative correlation between plasma anti ox-LDL IgG and α-tocopherol in the entire study population as well as in the smoker group suggests that plasma α-tocopherol may be partially effective if not totally at protecting LDL from oxidative damage caused by cigarette smoking and dietary supplementation with α-tocopherol may provide a protective effect against LDL oxidation, especially in smokers.

77954551049	Induction of heme oxygenase 1 and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor α-lnduced intercellular adhesion molecule expression by andrographolide in EA.hy926 cells	Andrographolide is the most abundant diterpene lactone in Andrographis panlculata, which is widely used as a traditional medicine in Southeast Asia. Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is an antioxidant enzyme encoded by a stress-responsive gene. HO-1 has been reported to inhibit the expression of adhesion molecules in vascular endothelial cells (EC). Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) is an inflammatory biomarker that is involved in the adhesion of monocytes to EC. In this study, we investigated the effect of andrographolide on the expression of ICAM-1 induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in EA.hy926 cells and the possible mechanisms involved. Andrographolide (2.5-7.5 μM) inhibited the TNF-a-induced expression of ICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner and resulted in a decrease in HL-60 cell adhesion to EA.hy926 cells (p < 0.05). In parallel, andrographolide significantly induced the expression of HO-1 in a concentration-dependent fashion (p < 0.05). Andrographolide increased the rate of nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 2 (Nrf2) and induced antioxidant response element-luciferase reporter activity. Transfection with HO-1-specific small interfering RNA knocked down HO-1 expression, and the inhibition of expression of ICAM-1 by andrographolide was significantly reversed. These results suggest that stimulation of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression is involved in the suppression of TNF-a-induced ICAM-1 expression exerted by andrographolide. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77954391572	Suppressive effects of extracts from the aerial part of Coriandrum sativum L. on LPS-induced inflammatory responses inmurine RAW 264.7 macrophages	BACKGROUND: Coriandrum sativum is used not only as a spice to aid flavour and taste values in food, but also as a folk medicine in many countries. Since little is known about the anti-inflammatory ability of the aerial parts (stem and leaf) of C. sativum, the present study investigated the effect of aerial parts of C. sativum on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7macrophages.We further explored themolecular mechanism underlying these pharmacological properties of C. sativum. RESULTS: Ethanolic extracts from both stem and leaf of C. sativum (CSEE) significantly decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 production as well as inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and pro-interleukin-1β expression. Moreover, LPS-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and nuclear p65 protein expression as well as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear protein-DNA binding affinity and reporter gene activity were dramatically inhibited by aerial parts of CSEE. Exogenous addition of CSEE stem and leaf significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that aerial parts of CSEE have a strong anti-inflammatory property which inhibits pro-inflammatorymediator expression by suppressing NF-κB activation and MAPK signal transduction pathway in LPS-induced macrophages. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.

80052589230	Oxidative modifications of proteins by sodium arsenite in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that chronic arsenic exposure is associated with the incidence of chronic diseases. This association is partly related to the increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) overload and protein oxidation that result from arsenic exposure. In this study, we intended to identify proteins susceptible to oxidative carbonylation by sodium arsenite and the impact of carbonylation on the function of these proteins in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) dot-blot assay revealed that arsenite (0-50 μM) dose-dependently increased protein carbonylation. Consistent with these findings, the cellular ROS level as measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCHF-DA) assay was increased in cells exposed to arsenite. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix assist laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS), one glycolytic enzyme, enolase-α, two cytoskeleton proteins, fascin (F-actin associated protein) and vimentin, and two protein quality control proteins, HSC70 (heat-shock cognate protein 70), and PDIA3 (protein disulfide isomerase family A, member 3) were identified to be arsenic-sensitive carbonlyated proteins. Accompanied by carbonylation, enolase-α activity was dose-dependently decreased and the F-actin filament network was disturbed. Taken together, our results suggest that arsenite exposure results in the generation of carbonylated proteins, and the resultant changes in energy metabolism and in the cytoskeletal network may partly lead to cell damage. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84866633608	The effect of garlic oil on insulin secretion in HIT-T15 cells	It is known that glucose toxicity suppresses insulin secretion. Using an islet β cell line (HIT-T15), the present study investigated the effect of garlic oil (GO) on insulin secretion. Cells were pre-cultured in various concentrations of glucose (5.5, 11.1, and 33.3 mM) with or without GO (1∼100 μg/ml) for 24 h followed by the determination of cell validity and insulin secretion in the pre-culture. After washing cells after the pre-culture, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), the cellular ATP content, and glucose transport kinetics were determined, The effect of GO on the oxidative condition of cells cultured under a hyperglycemic condition was also investigated. It was found that GO (1∼10 μg/ml) improved insulin secretion of cells in the pre-culture medium to a level similar to that of glibenclimide; it also improved the GSIS in association with elevated cellular ATP, decreased Km, and increased Vmax of the glucose transport system. Hyperglycemia increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in cells, although the total glutathione (GSH) content, the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) remained unaffected. GO improved SOD activity of cells cultured under a hyperglycemic condition; however, it did not ameliorate the increase in TBARS in these cells. In conclusion, GO acutely improved GSIS in the HIT-T15 β cell line cultured under normal and hyperglycemic conditions which was associated with increased glucose utilization by these cells but not through an antioxidant effect.

44449096648	Diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide suppress oxidized LDL-induced vascular cell adhesion molecule and E-selectin expression through protein kinase A- and B-dependent signaling pathways	Uptake of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) by vascular endothelial cells is a critical step in the initiation and development of atherosclerosis. Adhesion molecules are upregulated by ox-LDL and numerous inflammatory cytokines and play a pivotal role in atherogenesis. In this study, we examined whether diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), 3 major organosulfur compounds of garlic oil, reduce adhesion molecule expression induced by ox-LDL and, if so, through what mechanism. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were preincubated with 1 mmol/L DAS, 200 μmol/L DADS, or 100 μmol/L DATS for 16 h and then with 40 mg/L ox-LDL for an additional 24 h. ox-LDL induction of cellular and cell surface expression of E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 was suppressed by garlic allyl sulfides in the order DATS > DADS > DAS. The adhesion of HL-60 cells to endothelial cells was inhibited 27 and 33% and the production of cellular peroxides was inhibited 43 and 50% by DADS and DATS, respectively (P < 0.05). ox-LDL alone dephosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB); such deactivation was reversed by DADS and DATS. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the activation of CREB binding to DNA was consistent with changes in CREB phosphorylation. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 reversed the suppression of VCAM-1 by DADS and DATS, but the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin had no effect. In contrast, wortmannin abolished DADS- and DATS-induced suppression of ox-LDL-induced E-selectin expression. These results suggest that the suppression of ox-LDL-induced E-selectin and VCAM-1 expression by DADS and DATS and, thus, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is likely dependent on the PI3K/PKB or PKA/CREB signaling pathway in an adhesion molecule-specific manner. To our knowledge, this is the first report that garlic modulates ox-LDL-mediated leukocyte adhesion to human endothelial cells through the PKB and PKA pathways. © 2008 American Society for Nutrition.

60849095132	Cigarette smoke extract induces expression of cell adhesion molecules in HUVEC via actin filament reorganization	Epidemiologic studies have shown a strong association between cigarette smoking and cardiovascular diseases. Various oxidative species and free radicals are produced during cigarette smoking and these lead to endothelial dysfunction and inflammation. Expression of adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and adhesion of leukocytes are present in atherosclerosis. We showed previously that a nonfractionated cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induces surface expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We then investigated the role of the MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38) and AP-1 and the role of actin cytoskeleton reorganization in the CSE-induced expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin. Western blot analysis showed that CSE treatment rapidly and significantly caused phosphorylation of JNK and ERK1/2 but not of p38. Cytochalasin D (an actin filament disruptor) partially inhibited CSE-induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression. However, inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and JNK (SP600125) did not attenuate the CSE-induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that CSE enhanced AP-1 binding activity. Therefore, CSE activated AP-1 and upregulated ICAM-1 and E-selectin surface expression in HUVEC seem to be via an MAPK-independent pathway. Moreover, the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton seems to be required for the CSE-induced surface expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

62749135007	Docosahexaenoic acid downregulates phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P450 2B1 gene expression in rat primary hepatocytes via the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways play central roles in the transduction of extracellular stimuli into cells and the regulation of expression of numerous genes. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was shown to be involved in the regulation of expression of drug metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) in rat primary hepatocytes in response to xenobiotics. Cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP 2B1) is a DME that is dramatically induced by phenobarbital-type inducers. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) plays a critical role in regulating the expression of DMEs, and the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of CAR is an important event in CYP 2B1 expression. In the present study, we determined the effect of DHA on MAPK transactivation and its role in CYP 2B1 expression induced by phenobarbital. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) JNK1/2 and ERK1/2 were activated by phenobarbital in a dose-dependent manner. DHA (100 μM) inhibited JNK1/2 and ERK2 activation induced by phenobarbital in a time-dependent manner. Both SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) inhibited CYP 2B1 protein and mRNA expression induced by phenobarbital. SB203580 significantly increased the intracellular 3′-5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentration compared with a control group (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that inhibition of JNK activation by DHA is at least part of the mechanisms of DHA's downregulation of CYP 2B1 expression induced by phenobarbital. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

64549132534	Effect of supplementation with garlic oil on activity of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes from rats	Garlic and garlic products are known to induce anti-inflammatory effects, but much of the research to date has focused on the inhibitory effect of garlic on the activity of mononuclear cells/macrophages. The effect of garlic on the balance of the two mutually inhibitory T helper cell subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells, has hitherto received little attention. We thus studied the effect of supplementation with garlic oil on the activity of Th1 and Th2 cells. Rats were administered by gavage with garlic oil (10-200 mg/kg) or corn oil every other day for 2 weeks. Cervical lymph nodes were collected to assay the lymphocyte proliferation rate and the production of Th1 interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interferon γ(IFN-γ) and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 upon stimulation with concanavalin A. Garlic oil enhanced the lymphocyte proliferation rate accompanied by an elevated production of all four cytokines when given at a dose of 100 mg/kg. At 200 mg/ kg, the production of IL-4 and IL-10 was further enhanced but IFN-γ production was suppressed. The ratio of IFN-γ to IL-4 was enhanced by 50 mg/kg garlic oil but suppressed by 200 mg/kg garlic oil. In conclusion, supplemental garlic oil has a dual effect on Th1-Th2 cell balance: an enhanced T cell response towards the Th1 type at low doses and towards the Th2 type at high doses. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.

0035001920	Effects of organosulfur compounds from garlic oil on the antioxidation system in rat liver and red blood cells	The modulation of garlic oil (GO) and three allyl compounds, diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), on the antioxidation system in rat livers and red blood cells was examined. Rats were orally administered GO (200 mg/kg body weight), DAS (20, 80 mg/kg body weight), DADS (80 mg/kg body weight) or DATS (70 mg/kg body weight) three times a week for 6 weeks. Control rats received corn oil (2 ml/kg body weight) alone. GO, DADS and DATS treatment significantly increased the glutathione (GSH) content (48-84%) in red blood cells (P < 0.05). DATS displayed a greater enhancement than GO and DADS (P < 0.05). Hemolysis induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide was not suppressed by GO or allyl compound treatment although higher GSH content was evident. Hepatic GSH was not influenced by garlic components. In rat livers, DADS and DATS significantly increased the activity of GSH reductase (46 and 54%, respectively) and of GSH S-transferase (GST) (63 and 103%, respectively), but decreased the GSH peroxidase activity (27 and 28%, respectively). In contrast, GSH reductase and GST activities in the DAS group, either 20 or 80 mg/kg body weight, were similar to the control group. A decrease of GSH peroxidase activity was observed in rats dosed with 80 mg/kg body weight (P < 0.05). An increase in GST activity and a decrease in GSH peroxidase activities were also noted in GO-treated rats (P < 0.05). In red blood cells, three GSH-related antioxidant enzyme activities were not affected by garlic oil and its organosulfur components. Immunoblot assay showed that, accompanying the increase in hepatic GST activity, GO, DADS, DAS (80 mg/kg body weight) and DATS increased the expression of GST Ya, Yb1 and Yc proteins. Results indicate that GO and three allyl compounds play a differential role in modulation of the GSH-related antioxidant system in rat livers and red blood cells. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Rats assigned to Groups 1-4 were initiated with saline as the control and those assigned to Groups 5-7 were initiated with diethylnitrosamine (DEN 15 mg/kg) at 24 hours of age. After weaning, all rats, except those in Group 1, received 500 ppm phenobarbital (PB) in their diet as tumor promoter for three months. Altered hepatic foci development was significantly lower in DEN-initiated rats fed the high fish oil + PB diet than in DEN-initiated rats fed the high corn oil + PB diets. Liver weight and relative liver weight were significantly greater in rats fed the high fish oil + PB diet than in rats fed the other diets, and hepatic biotransformation/detoxification enzyme activities were greater in rats fed the fish oil + PB diets than in rats fed the other diets. These results suggest that the effect of a high fish oil diet on altered hepatic foci may occur through regulation of hepatic biotransformation/detoxification enzyme activities, leading to alteration in the tumor-promoting action of PB. Dietary lipid significantly affected the hepatic phospholipid fatty acid composition of rats. n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were incorporated into membrane phospholipid at the expense of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids. A high fish oil diet caused greater oxidative stress in rats, as measured by plasma vitamin E level, red blood cell glutathione status, liver lipid peroxidation, and hepatic glutathione reductase activity. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that the foci number was negatively correlated to the liver thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance and 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase activity, and the foci area was negatively correlated to the liver thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance activity (p < 0.05) in rats of groups that developed foci. These results suggest that the type of dietary lipid is the more important determinant for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase-positive foci development than the amount of dietary lipid when rats consumed approximately the same amount of calories in all the dietary groups, and the underlying mechanisms may be partially ascribed to the antioxidant/oxidation status and biotransformation/detoxification system of rats.

0035289953	Adverse effects of arecoline and nicotine on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts in vitro	Background, aims: The habit of betel nut chewing impinges on the daily lives of approximately 200 million people. Betel quid chewers have a higher prevalence of periodontal diseases than non-chewers. This study examined the pathobiological effects of arecoline, a major component of the betel nut alkaloids, on human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) in vitro. Method: Cell viability, proliferation, protein synthesis, and cellular thiol levels were used to investigate the effects of human PDLF exposed to arecoline levels of 0 to 200 μg/ml. In addition, nicotine was added to test how it modulated the effects of arecoline. Results: Arecoline significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations of 10 and 30 μg/ml, arecoline suppressed the growth of PDLF by 20% and 50% (p<0.05), respectively. Arecoline also decreased protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner during a 24-h culture period. A 100 μg/ ml concentration level of arecoline significantly inhibited protein synthesis to only 50% of that in the untreated control (p<0.05). Moreover, arecoline significantly depleted intracellular thiols in a dose-dependent manner. At concentrations of 25 μg/ml and 100 μg/ml, arecoline depleted about 18% and 56% of thiols (p<0.05), respectively. This suggests that arecoline itself might augment the destruction of periodontium associated with betel nut use. Furthermore, the addition of nicotine acted with a synergistic effect on the arecoline-induced cytotoxicity. At a concentration of 60 μg/ml, arecoline suppressed the growth of PDLF by about 33%, and 5 mM nicotine enhanced the arecoline-induced cytotoxic response to cause about 66% cell death. Conclusion: During thiol depletion, arecoline may render human PDLF more vulnerable to reactive agents within cigarettes. Taken together, people who combine habits of betel nut chewing with cigarette smoking could be more susceptible to periodontium damage than betel nut chewing alone. Copyright © Munksgaard 2001.

76749120379	Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. reduces the oxidized LDL-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Ethnopharmacological relevance: The flower of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. (CM) with antioxidant, cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory functions, has been widely used in China for hundreds of years as a healthy beverage and medicine. Aims of the study: The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of HCM (a hot water extract of the flower of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat. [CM]), ECM (an ethanol extract of CM), and the abundant flavonoids apigenin and luteolin in CM on the oxidized LDL (oxLDL)-induced expression of ICAM-1 and E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The possible mechanism of these effects was also determined. Materials and methods: MTT assay was for cell viability. Western blot was used for ICAM-1 and E-selection protein expression, and for activation of protein kinase B (PKB) and cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) proteins. Fluorescence flow cytometry was for ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression on cell surface. DCF-DA flow cytometric assay was used for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Results: HCM, ECM, apigenin, and luteolin dose-dependently inhibited ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression and adhesion of HL-60 by oxLDL. HCM, ECM, apigenin, and luteolin reversed the inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt and CREB by oxLDL; however, this reversion was abolished by wortmannin. In addition, wortmannin abrogated the inhibitory effects of CM extracts, apigenin and luteolin on adhesion molecule expression. The ROS scavenging capability of HCM, ECM, apigenin, and luteolin proceeded dose-dependently in the presence of oxLDL. Conclusion: CM is a plant with cardiovascular-protective potential and the inhibitory effects of CM on ICAM-1 and E-selectin expression are, at least partially, attributed to its antioxidant activity and modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

77649274551	Docosahexaenoic acid down-regulates phenobarbital-induced cytochrome P450 2B1 gene expression in rat primary hepatocytes via the sphingomyelinase/ceramide pathway	Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) regulates the expression of cytochrome P450 2B1 (CYP 2B1) in rat primary hepatocytes in response to xenobiotics. Ceramide, a lipid signaling molecule, is involved in various physiological processes and can be generated by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin via sphingomyelinase (SMase). DHA activates SMase and increases ceramide formation in vitro. Ceramides differentially enhance adenylyl cyclase activity in vitro depending on the chain length of their fatty acids. In addition, the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway down-regulates CYP 2B1 expression induced by phenobarbital (PB). In the present study, we determined the effect of DHA on SMase transactivation and the downstream pathway in CYP 2B1 expression induced by PB. SMase was activated by DHA 2 h after treatment, and D609 (an SMase inhibitor) attenuated the inhibition of PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression by DHA. Ceramide formation reached a maximum 3 h after DHA administration. C2-ceramide dose-dependently inhibited PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression and increased intracellular cAMP concentrations. SQ22536 (an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor) and H89 (a PKA-specific inhibitor) partially reversed the inhibition of PB-induced CYP 2B1 expression by C2-ceramide. These results suggest that stimulation of SMase, generation of ceramide and activation of the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway are involved in the inhibition exerted by DHA. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

76149140866	Gamma-linolenic acid inhibits inflammatory responses by regulating nf-κB and AP-1 activation in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages	Gamma linolenic acid (GLA) is a member of the n-6 family of polyunsaturated fatty acids and can be synthesized from linoleic acid (LA) by the enzyme delta-6-desaturase. The therapeutic values of GLA supplementation have been documented, but the molecular mechanism behind the action of GLA in health benefits is not clear. In this study, we assessed the effect of GLA with that of LA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses and further explored the molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological properties of GLA in mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages. GLA significantly inhibited LPS-induced protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, pro-interleukin-1β, and cyclooxygenase-2 as well as nitric oxide production and the intracellular glutathione level. LA was less potent than GLA in inhibiting LPS-induced inflammatory mediators. Both GLA and LA treatments dramatically inhibited LPS-induced IκB-α degradation, IκB-α phosphorylation, and nuclear p65 protein expression. Moreover, LPS-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) nuclear protein-DNA binding affinity and reporter gene activity were significantly decreased by LA and GLA. Exogenous addition of GLA but not LA significantly reduced LPS-induced expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-1. Our data suggest that GLA inhibits inflammatory responses through inactivation of NF-κB and AP-1 by suppressed oxidative stress and signal transduction pathway of ERK and JNK in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

77951290917	Effect of chitosan on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and oxidative stress in rats fed low- and high-fat diets	Chitosan is sold worldwide as a lipid-lowering functional food and may be taken with certain medications. To investigate the effect of chitosan on drug-metabolizing enzymes and oxidative stress in the liver, male Wistar rats were fed a low- or high-fat diet with cellulose or chitosan for 4 weeks. A significant decrease in cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in liver microsomes was observed in rats fed the chitosan with low- and high-fat diets. The expression of CYP 3A1 and 3A2, however, was suppressed by chitosan in rats fed the low-fat diet only. Furthermore, rats fed the low-fat diet with chitosan had lower hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and superoxide dismutase activity and higher total tissue and microsomal lipid hydroperoxides. Hepatic α-tocopherol was lower in rats fed the chitosan-containing diet. The results suggest that chitosan is likely to modulate CYP 3A activity and protein expression and GST activity partially in a dietary fat-dependent manner. This change may cause a decrease in the metabolism of drugs catalyzed by these enzymes in liver tissues. Moreover, decrease of α-tocopherol level and SOD activity by chitosan partly accounts for the increase of hepatic lipid peroxidation. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

77951480791	Sulforaphane and α-lipoic acid upregulate the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase through c-jun and Nrf2 activation	The anticarcinogenic effect of dietary organosulfur compounds has been partly attributed to their modulation of the activity and expression of phase II detoxification enzymes. Our previous studies indicated that garlic allyl sulfides upregulate the expression of the p class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) through the activator protein-1 pathway. Here, we examined the modulatory effect of sulforaphane (SFN) and a-lipoic acid (LA) or dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) on GSTP expression in rat Clone 9 liver cells. Cells were treated with LA or DHLA (50-600 mmol/L) or SFN (0.2-5 mmol/L) for 24 h. Immunoblots and real-time PCR showed that SFN, LA, and DHLA dose dependently induced GSTP protein and mRNA expression. Compared with the induction by the garlic organosulfur compound diallyl trisulfide (DATS), the effectiveness was in the order of SFN . DATS . LA = DHLA. The increase in GSTP enzyme activity in cells treated with 5 mmol/L SFN, 50 mmol/L DATS, and 600 mmol/L LA and DHLA was 172, 75, 122, and 117%, respectively (P , 0.05). A reporter assay showed that the GSTP enhancer I (GPEI) was required for GSTP induction by the organosulfur compounds. Electromobility gel shift assays showed that the DNA binding of GPEI to nuclear proteins reached a maximum at 0.5-1 h after SFN, LA, and DHLA treatment. Super-shift assay revealed that the transcription factors c-jun and nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) were bound to GPEI. These results suggest that SFN and LA in either its oxidized or reduced form upregulate the transcription of the GSTP gene by activating c-jun and Nrf2 binding to the enhancer element GPEI. © 2010 American Society for Nutrition.

77951639363	Atorvastatin increases blood ratios of vitamin E/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and coenzyme Q10/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients	Statins are among the most widely used drugs in the management of hypercholesterolemia. In addition to inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis, however, statins decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis. CoQ10 has been reported to have antioxidant properties, and administration of drugs that decrease CoQ10 synthesis might lead to increased oxidative stress in vivo. Our present study examined the hypothesis that atorvastatin increased oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients due to its inhibition of CoQ10 synthesis. We investigated the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) administration for 5 months on lowering hypercholesterolemia and blood antioxidant status. The study population included 19 hypercholesterolemic outpatients. Blood levels of lipid and antioxidant markers, consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, and glutathione (GSH), and urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were examined pre- and postadministration of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin administration resulted in a significant decrease in blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, vitamin E, and CoQ10 (. P < .05); however, a significant increase in the ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol was noted (. P < .05). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on red blood cell (RBC) level of GSH and urinary 8-OHdG. The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin exerts a hypocholesterolemic effect, but on the basis of the urinary level of 8-OHdG and the blood ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol, has no oxidative stress-inducing effect. © 2010.

77952348288	Diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide protect endothelial nitric oxide synthase against damage by oxidized lowdensity lipoprotein	Garlic is viewed as an effective health food against atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined whether diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS) protect endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation against oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) insult and through what mechanism. We found that DADS and DATS reversed the suppression of eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation by ox-LDL, and wortmannin abolished the reversal by DADS and DATS. Similarly, the inhibition of cellular cGMP and nitric oxide production by ox-LDL was reversed by DADS and DATS (p<0.05). This increase in nitric oxide bioavailability by the allyl sulfides was attenuated by wortmannin. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that DADS and DATS preserved the interaction of eNOS with caveolin-1 in the membrane. In addition, DADS and DATS suppressed the reduction of the cellular eNOS protein content by ox-LDL. When cycloheximide was added to block protein synthesis, DADS and DATS suppressed eNOS protein degradation similarly to that noted by MG132. Ox-LDL increased chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, and this increase was inhibited by the allyl sulfides and MG132 (p<0.05). These results suggest that DADS and DATS protect eNOS activity against ox-LDL insult. This protection can be attributed partly to their mediation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and prevention of eNOS degradation. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

77953485564	The protection of hepatocyte cells from the effects of oxidative stress by treatment with vitamin e in conjunction with DTT	We investigated the effect of vitamin E on membrane protein thiols under oxidative stress, which we induced by treating hepatocytes with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) for 60 mins. Those cells which we pretreated with vitamin E formed fewer blebs (22.3 compared to 60.0 in nonvitamin E-treated cells) and maintained cytosolic calcium concentration and the number of membrane protein thiols instead of showing the usual symptoms in cells undergoing oxidative stress. Dithiothreitol (DTT) also commonly reduces bleb formation in hepatocytes affected by TBH. However, our experiments clearly demonstrate that DTT does not prevent the changes in cytosolic calcium and membrane protein thiols in the blebbing cells. Consequently, we decided to pretreat cells with both DTT and vitamin E and found that the influence of TBH was entirely prevented. These findings may provide us with a new aspect for investigating the mechanism of bleb formation under oxidative stress. Copyright © 2010 Jen-Hsiang Tsai et al.

77953971974	Methionine restriction up-regulates the expression of the pi class of glutathione S-transferase partially via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase-activator protein-1 signaling pathway initiated by glutathione depletion	Understanding the molecular events underlying gene regulation by amino acids has attracted increasing attention. Here, we explored whether the mechanism by which methionine restriction affects the expression of the p class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) is related to oxidative stress initiated by glutathione (GSH) depletion. Rat primary hepatocytes were cultured in an L-15-based medium in the absence or presence of 200 μM L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or in a methionine-restricted L-15 medium supplemented with 20 mM L-methionine up to 72 h.

77956515291	Butein up-regulates the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase in rat primary hepatocytes through the ERK/AP-1 pathway	Induction of phase II enzymes is an important mechanism of chemoprevention. Here we compared the effects of chalcones on the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) in rat primary hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with 10 or 25 μM of phloretin or butein for 24 h. Both butein and phloretin dose-dependently increased GSTP protein expression, and the induction potency of butein was stronger than that of phloretin. The increase in GSTP mRNA in cells treated with 25 μM of phloretin and butein was 107% and 211%, respectively (P > 0.05). Butein increased GST enzyme activity by 27% compared with that in the control cells (P > 0.05). In contrast, phloretin had no significant effect on GST enzyme activity. The pTA-luciferase reporter construct with the rat -2.7 kb GSTP promoter region was transiently transfected into Clone 9 liver cells, and the luciferase activity in butein-treated cells was 1.1-fold higher than that in control cells (P > 0.05).

78049254490	Cardiac contractile dysfunction and apoptosis in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats are ameliorated by garlic oil supplementation	Previous studies have suggested that garlic oil could protect the cardiovascular system. However, the mechanism by which garlic oil protects diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy is unclear. In this study, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats received garlic oil (0, 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg of body weight) by gastric gavage every 2 days for 16 days. Normal rats without diabetes were used as control. Cardiac contractile dysfunction examined by echocardiography and apoptosis evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay were observed in diabetic rat hearts. Additionally, a shift in cardiac myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene expression from α- to β-MHC isoform, decreased levels of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and cardiac α-actin, and elevated cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and caspase- and p38-NFkB-leading apoptosis signaling activities were demonstrated in diabetic hearts. However, these diabetes-related cardiac dysfunctions were almost dose-dependently ameliorated by garlic oil administration. In conclusion, garlic oil possesses significant potential for protecting hearts from diabetes-induced cardiomyopathy. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

78650274409	Andrographolide-induced pi class of glutathione S-transferase gene expression via PI3K/Akt pathway in rat primary hepatocytes	Andrographis paniculata is an herb widely used in China, Korea, and India for its anti-hepatotoxic, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects. Andrographolide is the major bioactive diterpene lactone in A. paniculata. The pi class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) is one of the phase II biotransformation enzymes. Our previous study indicated that andrographolide upregulates the expression of GSTP. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which andrographolide induces GSTP gene expression in rat primary hepatocytes. In hepatocytes treated with 40. μM andrographolide, immunoblots showed maximal Akt phosphorylation at 0.5. h and maximal c-jun phosphorylation at 3. h. However, pretreatment with PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, or siPI3K inhibited the andrographolide-induced phosphorylation of c-jun and GSTP protein expression. EMSA showed that pretreatment with wortmannin, LY294002, or siPI3K attenuated the AP-1-DNA-binding activity caused by andrographolide. Results of immunoprecipitation indicated that nuclear c-fos/c-jun heterodimer increases with andrographolide treatment. Addition of antibodies against c-jun and c-fos decreased nuclear protein bound to the AP-1 consensus DNA sequence. In summary, andrographolide induces GSTP gene expression in rat primary hepatocytes through activation of the PI3K/Akt, phosphorylation of c-jun, nuclear accumulation of AP-1, and subsequent binding to the response element in the gene promoter region. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

79955013103	Suppressive effect of the ethanolic extract of adlay bran on cytochrome P-450 enzymes in rat liver and lungs	Adlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf) is a grass crop and is reported to protect against various diseases such as cancer. To investigate the effect of the ethanolic extract of adlay bran (ABE) on drug-metabolizing enzymes and glutathione-related antioxidant enzymes in rats, three groups of eight male Sprague-Dawley rats each were fed a control diet or a diet containing 5 or 10% ABE for 4 weeks. Significant decreases in microsomal cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A1-catalyzed ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation, CYP2C-catalyzed diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, CYP2D-catalyzed dextromethorphan O-demethylation, and CYP3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in the liver and CYP1A1-catalyzed ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation in the lungs of rats fed ABE were observed. Immunoblot analyses also showed decreases of CYP1A1, 1A2, 2C6, 2C11, 2D1, 2E1, 3A1, and 3A2 in the liver and CYP1A1 in the lungs. Furthermore, rats fed the 10% ABE diet had a higher glutathione content and glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S-transferase activities in the lungs, but such an increase was not noted in the liver. Inhibition of various CYP-catalyzed enzyme reactions by ABE in rat and human liver microsomes had also been shown. The results of this study indicate that ABE feeding may suppress CYP enzyme activities and CYP protein expression in the liver and lungs of rats. Moreover, the increase of the antioxidant potential by ABE is tissue-specific. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

79953845427	Structure and function relationship study of allium organosulfur compounds on upregulating the Pi class of glutathione S-transferase expression	Allium organosulfides are potential chemopreventive compounds due to their effectiveness on the induction of phase II detoxification enzyme expression. In this study, we examined the structure and function relationship among various alk(en)yl sulfides on the expression of the pi class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) in rat Clone 9 cells, and what mechanism is involved. Cells were treated with 300 μM dipropyl sulfide (DPS), dipropyl disulfide (DPDS), propyl methyl sulfide (PMS), and propyl methyl disulfide (PMDS) for 48 h. DPDS and PMDS displayed more potency on GSTP protein and mRNA induction than that of DPS and PMS. Next, we compared the effectiveness of DPDS, PMDS, and diallyl disulfide (DADS), which have the same number of sulfur atoms but differ in the side alk(en)yl groups. The maximum increases on protein expression, mRNA level, and enzyme activity were noted in cells treated with DADS, followed by DPDS and PMDS. A reporter assay showed that three disulfides increased GSTP enhancer I (GPE I) activity (P < 0.05) in the order DADS > DPDS ≥ PMDS. Electromobility gel shift assays showed that the DNA binding of GPE I to nuclear proteins reached a maximum at 1 to 3 h after alk(en)yl disulfide treatment. Supershift assay revealed that c-jun bound to GPE I. Silencing of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 2 expression inhibited c-jun activation and GSTP induction. Results suggest that both the type of alk(en)yl groups and number of sulfur atoms are determining factors of allium organosulfides on inducing GSTP expression, and it is likely related to the ERK-c-Jun-GPE I pathway. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

0035809840	Root canal sealers cause cytotoxicity and oxidative damage in hepatocytes	Elutable substances and degradation products from root canal sealers may gain access to periodontal tissue in many ways. The aim of this study was to investigate damage and oxidative stress caused by treatment with root canal sealers in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. Four root canal sealers were used: Canals, Sealapex, AH 26, and AH Plus. Toxicity was detected by assessing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and oxidative stress was determined by analysis of glutathione (GSH) levels. One-way analysis of variance was performed on the data. As the concentrations of sealer were increased, LDH leakage increased (p<0.01). Increased GSH depletion accompanied LDH leakage increase. GSH levels were reduced to zero at a concentration of 0.05% for Canals and 0.10% for AH 26. These results confirmed the hypothesis that root canal sealers can cause cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. The Canals and AH 26 sealers can also cause oxidative stress in hepatocytes.

0035816403	Disulfide bonds stabilize JC virus capsid-like structure by protecting calcium ions from chelation	To investigate the role of disulfide bonds in the capsid structure, a recombinant JC virus-like particle (VLP) was used. The major capsid protein, VP1, of the JC virus was expressed in yeast cells. The yeast-expressed VP1 was self-assembled into a VLP. Disulfide bonds were found in the VLP which caused dimeric and trimeric VP1 linkages as demonstrated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. The VLP remained intact when disulfide bonds were reduced by dithiothreitol. The VLP without disulfide bonds could be disassembled into capsomeres by EGTA alone, but those with disulfide bonds could not be disassembled by EGTA. Capsomeres were reassembled into VLPs in the presence of calcium ions. Capsomeres formed irregular aggregations instead of VLPs when treated with diamide to reconstitute the disulfide bonds. These results indicate that disulfide bonds play an important role in maintaining the integrity of the JC VLP by protecting calcium ions from chelation. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

0036317726	Elevated vimentin expression in buccal mucosal fibroblasts by arecoline in vitro as a possible pathogenesis for oral submucous fibrosis	Areca quid chewing is strongly correlated with oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) in Taiwan. The cytotoxicity of arecoline, a major areca nut alkaloid, on human oral fibroblasts has been extensively studied. To date, however, there has been little research exploring the possible effects of arecoline on cytoskeleton components. In this study, in addition to conducting a cytotoxicity assay, we examine the effect of arecoline on vimentin, an intermediate filament, and its expression in human buccal mucosal fibroblasts on exposure to various levels of arecoline (0-200 μg/ml) for 48 h. At a concentration above 50 μg/ml, arecoline demonstrated dose-dependent cytotoxicity (P<0.05) for cultured fibroblasts. Using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we demonstrated dose-dependent elevation of 57 kDa cytoskeletal-protein levels for arecoline. Evidence from immunoblotting assay indicated this 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein was vimentin. The increase in vimentin with arecoline exposure corresponded to that noted for fibroblasts cultured from OSF patients. Immunohistochemical assay also revealed that vimentin expression was much higher for OSF specimens than for normal buccal mucosa. We suggest these results may advance understanding of the possible pathogenesis for submucous fibrosis through the transformation of normal buccal mucosa as a result of areca quid chewing. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0036393810	Alterations of plasma antioxidants and mitochondrial DNA mutation in hair follicles of smokers	The effects of long-term smoking on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in hair follicles were investigated in subjects with different antioxidant capacity. Twenty-two male smokers with a smoking index of greater than 5 pack-years and without any known systemic diseases were recruited for this study. Forty healthy nonsmoking males were included as controls. We found that the concentrations of ascorbate and α-tocopherol and the activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase in blood plasma were significantly decreased in smokers. The levels of glutathione and protein thiols in whole blood and the incidence of a 4,977 bp deletion of mtDNA (dmtDNA) in hair follicles were significantly increased in smokers. A significantly higher incidence of the 4,977 bp dmtDNA was found in smokers with plasma GST activity less than 5.66 U/I (OR = 7.2, P = 0.020). Using multiple covariate ANOVA and logistic regression, we found that age and low plasma GST activity were the only two risk factors for the 4,977 bp dmtDNA. These results suggest that smoking depletes antioxidants and causes mtDNA deletions and that plasma GST may play an important role in the preservation of the mitochondrial genome in tissue cells of smokers. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

79957935298	Andrographolide inhibits ICAM-1 expression and NF-κB activation in TNF-α-treated EA.hy926 cells	Several lines of evidence indicate that inflammation and endothelial cell dysfunction are important initiating events in atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, induces the expression of cell adhesion molecules and results in monocyte adherence and atheromatous plaque formation. Andrographolide (AP) is a major bioactive diterpene lactone in Andrographis paniculata that has anti-inflammatory activity. A previous study demonstrated the role of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the inhibition of TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression by AP. The present study investigated the effect of AP on the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway, which mediates TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression in EA.hy926 cells. Similar to the previous study, AP inhibited TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 mRNA and protein levels, its expression on the cell surface, and subsequent adhesion of HL-60 cells to EA.hy926 cells. AP inhibited TNF-α-induced κB inhibitor (IκB) kinase (IKK) and IκBα activation, p65 nuclear translocation, NF-κB and DNA binding activity, and promoter activity of ICAM-1. Although AP increased the intracellular cAMP concentration and induced the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), knocking down CREB protein expression by transfecting the cells with CREB-specific small interfering RNA did not relieve the inhibition of ICAM-1 expression by AP. Taken together, these results suggest that AP down-regulates TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression at least in part via attenuation of activation of NF-κB in EA.hy926 cells rather than through activation of CREB. The results suggest that AP may have potential as a cardiovascular-protective agent. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

79959454705	Effect of shengmai san on insulin resistance, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and oxidative stress in rats fed on a high-fat diet	Shengmai San (SMS) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine formula prescribed for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Insulin resistance is the most likely explanation for the development and progression of this disease. To investigate the effect of SMS on high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance, inflammatory cytokine production and oxidative stress, male Wistar rats were fed with low-fat control diet, high-fat diet and high-fat diet supplemented with 4% SMS for eight weeks. An oral glucose tolerance test was conducted in the seventh week. Rats fed the SMS diet had significantly lower plasma fructosamine concentration (p < 0.05) and tended to have lower (p < 0.1) AUC values of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations after glucose challenge, compared to those fed the high-fat diet. Moreover, SMS reduced TNF-α and lipid peroxidation levels in the liver and heart. However, SMS had no effect on fasting plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglyceride, non-esterified fatty acids, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment; HOMA) in rats. Our results show that SMS may have little or no significant effect on reducing insulin resistance, but display anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties.

79959853014	Relationship between antioxidant and antiglycation ability of saponins, polyphenols, and polysaccharides in Chinese herbal medicines used to treat diabetes	Advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. Both are known to interact with each other. Therefore, natural compounds or extracts that possess both antioxidant and antiglycation activities might have great therapeutic potential for treating diabetic complications. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the antiglycation and antioxidant properties of aqueous extracts from 22 Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) that are commonly used to treat diabetes. The total polysaccharide, polyphenol, and saponin contents in the CHM extracts were determined by use of standard methods to establish their contribution to the antioxidant and antiglycation properties. Our results showed that: 1) half CHMs evaluated in this study possessed both high antiglycation and high antioxidant activities, and 2) the total saponin content was the major compound responsible for the antiglycation activity. The total saponin content may also contribute significantly to antioxidant activity. We conclude that the 11 CHMs with both high antiglycation and high antioxidant activities are potential bioactive compounds in the treatment of diabetes. © 2011 Academic Journals.

79960588927	Effect of garlic oil on neutrophil infiltration in the small intestine of endotoxin-injected rats and its association with levels of soluble and cellular adhesion molecules	Garlic (Allium sativum) possesses anti-inflammatory effects. This study investigated the effects of garlic oil on endotoxin-induced neutrophil infiltration in the small intestine. Wistar rats received by gavage 10, 50, or 100 mg/kg body wt garlic oil (GO) or the vehicle (corn oil; 2 mL/kg body wt) every other day for 2 weeks before being injected with endotoxin (ip, 5 mg/kg body wt). Control rats were administered corn oil and injected with sterile saline. Blood samples for the measurement of soluble adhesion molecules were collected at various time points after injection, and all other samples were collected 18 h after injection. The 10 and 50 mg/kg doses suppressed endotoxin-induced neutrophilia, serum levels of sL-selectin and sICAM-1, cellular CD11b on neutrophils, intestinal ICAM-1 content, and neutrophil infiltration (P < 0.05). The 100 mg/kg dose significantly lowered local ICAM-1 and cellular CD11b on neutrophils (P < 0.05) but did not have a beneficial effect on neutrophil infiltration. In addition, 100 mg/kg of GO worsened the elevation of the local TNF-α level and neutrophilia. Appropriate doses of garlic oil have a preventive effect on endotoxin-induced neutrophil infiltration and damage to the small intestine. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

80255126225	Induction of glutathione synthesis and heme oxygenase 1 by the flavonoids butein and phloretin is mediated through the ERK/Nrf2 pathway and protects against oxidative stress	Butein and phloretin are chalcones that are members of the flavonoid family of polyphenols. Flavonoids have well-known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In rat primary hepatocytes, we examined whether butein and phloretin affect tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative damage and the possible mechanism(s) involved. Treatment with butein and phloretin markedly attenuated tBHP-induced peroxide formation, and this amelioration was reversed by l-buthionine-S-sulfoximine [a glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) inhibitor] and zinc protoporphyrin [a heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) inhibitor]. Butein and phloretin induced both HO-1 and GCL protein and mRNA expression and increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) and total GSH content. Butein treatment activated the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation, Nrf2 nuclear protein-DNA binding activity, and ARE-luciferase reporter activity. The roles of the ERK signaling pathway and Nrf2 in butein-induced HO-1 and GCL catalytic subunit (GCLC) expression were determined by using RNA interference directed against ERK2 and Nrf2. Both siERK2 and siNrf2 abolished butein-induced HO-1 and GCLC protein expression. These results suggest the involvement of ERK2 and Nrf2 in the induction of HO-1 and GCLC by butein. In an animal study, phloretin was shown to increase GSH content and HO-1 expression in rat liver and decrease carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, we demonstrate that butein and phloretin up-regulate HO-1 and GCL expression through the ERK2/Nrf2 pathway and protect hepatocytes against oxidative stress. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

82355190327	Inhibition of TNF-α-induced inflammation by andrographolide via down-regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway	Andrographolide (1), an active constituent of Andrographis paniculata, decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression and adhesion of HL-60 cells onto human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are associated with inflammatory diseases. Moreover, 1 abolished TNF-α-induced Akt phosphorylation. Transfection of an activated Akt1 cDNA vector increased Akt phosphorylation and ICAM-1 expression like TNF-α. In addition, 1 and LY294002 blocked TNF-α-induced IκB-α degradation and nuclear p65 protein accumulation, as well as the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. Compound 1 exhibits anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of TNF-α-induced ICAM-1 expression. The anti-inflammatory activity of 1 may be associated with the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and downstream target NF-κB activation in HUVEC cells. © 2011 The American Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosy.

83455200346	Correlation of major components and radical scavenging activity of commercial tea drinks in Taiwan	Correlation of major components with free radical scavenging activities of 27 commercial tea drinks prepared from green, Oolong, and black teas in Taiwan were investigated. Green tea drinks contained the highest level of total catechins including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin (EC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG), while these components were low in black tea drinks and moderate in Oolong tea drinks. EGC and EGCG were the major catechins in the three types of tea drinks, and gallic acid showed the highest abundance in black tea drinks. Caffeine concentrations were comparable in the three types of tea drinks. All black tea drinks contained sugars, and sucrose was the main sweetener added. The scavenging abilities against l,l-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radicals were used to determine the antioxidant potential of tea drinks, and the ranked order of potency was green tea > Oolong tea > black tea. Total phenolics, total catechins, and EGC of tea drinks were positively and significantly (r > 0.8) correlated to the scavenging abilities against DPPH and ABTS radicals. Our results show that green tea drinks have higher free radical scavenging activity than black and Oolong tea drinks may be related to their high levels of total phenolics and catechins.

84861682975	Flavonoids protect pancreatic beta-cells from cytokines mediated apoptosis through the activation of PI3-kinase pathway	The preventive effects of four phenolic compounds against cytokines-induced β-cell destruction were assessed in this study. Treatment of INS-1 (832/13) cells with pro-inflammatory cytokine mixtures (interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)) resulted in an increased apoptosis. While resveratrol or myricetin failed to prevent cell apoptosis, quercetin or naringenin treatment exhibited an about 40% less in cell death induced by cytokines-mediated damage. This protective effect of quercetin or naringenin might be mediated partially via the activation of the downstream pAkt and pBad pathways, an outcome which was abolished by pretreatment with a specific PI3-kinase inhibitor. Cellular protein levels of p-p38 MAPK and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) were enhanced after cytokines addition; however, the presence of quercetin or naringenin could not suppress their expression. While cytokines induced MnSOD, quercetin or naringnin did not further enhance expression of this protective protein. In addition, the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) after cytokines treatment might be partially corrected with quercetin or naringenin. However, none of the phenolic compounds tested in this study reversed the blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after cytokines treatment. These results suggest that quercetin or naringenin might possibly be able to protect β-cells from cytokines toxicity by enhancing cell survival through PI3-kinase pathway, independent of p-p38 MAPK or iNOS. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84862798717	Effects of chitosan oligosaccharides on drug-metabolizing enzymes in rat liver and kidneys	To investigate the effect of chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) on drug-metabolizing enzymes in rat liver and kidneys, male Spraque-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 1% or 3% COS for 5. weeks. The activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, UDP-glucurosyltransferase (UGT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the liver and kidneys were determined. Significant decreases in microsomal CYP3A-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation, CYP2C-catalyzed diclofenac 4-hydroxylation, and CYP4A-catalyzed lauric acid 12-hydroxylation in the liver of rats fed the COS diets were observed compared with those rats fed the control diet. Immunoblot analyses of CYP proteins showed the same trend as with enzyme activities. Increased glutathione content in liver was found in rats fed the 1% COS diet. Increased hepatic NADPH: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) activity was found in rats fed the COS diets. In kidneys, COS had little or no effect on CYP enzyme activities. However, increased GST activity was observed in rats fed the COS diets. Moreover, a higher UGT activity was found in rats fed the 1% COS diet. Our results indicate that COS may suppress hepatic CYP enzymes and induce phase II detoxifying reactions in the liver and kidneys of rats. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84861960190	Effects of Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and plasma tolbutamide concentration in rats	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BT) is the dry powder derived from the aqueous extract of a mixture of 10 medicinal herbs. It is a traditional Chinese medicine being used for the treatment of various immune-related diseases. Aim of the study: To investigate the effect of BT on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes and its effect on plasma concentrations of tolbutamide, a substrate of CYP2C, in rats. Materials and methods: Exp 1: Thirty-two male Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Rats were fed a control diet and a control diet containing 1, 2.5 and 5% (w/w) of BT, respectively, for eight weeks. The activities of the major CYP and Phase II conjugating enzymes in rat liver microsomes as well as the antioxidant system in rat liver were assessed. Exp 2: Male Wistar rats were fed a control diet or a control diet containing 2.5% of BT, respectively, for eight weeks. A single 20-mg/kg oral dose of tolbutamide was then administered to each rat. Plasma samples were collected from each rat at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after dosing. The concentrations of tolbutamide and glucose level in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (HPLC/MS) and enzymatic method, respectively. Results: Significant decrease in microsomal CYP2C-catalyzed diclofenac 4-hydroxylation in the liver of rats fed the BT diet was observed. Increased UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were also observed in the liver of rats fed the diet containing 2.5 and 5% of BT. Immunoblot analyses also showed decreases of CYP2C11 proteins in the liver of BT fed rats. In addition, rats fed the 2.5% BT diet for eight weeks had no effects on the disposition of tolbutamide and reduction of glucose level in plasma after orally administered of tolbutamide. Conclusions: Rats fed the BT diet for eight weeks may decrease CYP2C enzyme activity and protein expression and increase Phase II conjugating enzyme activities in liver. However, BT may not affect the disposition and efficacy of tolbutamide. Crown Copyright © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

84862832466	Garlic: Health benefits and actions	Recent years have seen an increasing emphasis on foods and food components in disease prevention. Garlic (Allium sativum L.), one of the best-researched herbal remedies, holds a unique position in history, traditionally employed to treat infection, colds, diabetes, heart disease, and a host of other disorders. Clinically, it has been evaluated for lowering blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose concentration, as well as for the prevention of arteriosclerosis and cancer. Epidemiologically, garlic consumption inversely correlates with the risk of oral, stomach, esophageal, colon, and prostate cancers. In addition, the biological activities of garlic, including antibacterial, antithrombotic, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antidiabetic actions and modulation of drug metabolism, have been extensively investigated. Here, we briefly summarize the recent findings on garlic and its sulfur-containing compounds in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer, along with its modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and membrane transporter activities. Finally, garlic safety and drug interaction are discussed. © 2012.

84863082249	Differential blood lipid-lowering effects of alkylsulfonated chitosan of different molecular weights in Syrian hamsters in vivo	This study investigated the effects of alkylsulfonated chitosan of different molecular weights on intestinal lipid absorption, blood lipid profiles and circulating adhesion molecules. Syrian hamsters were fed an AIN-93G-based high-fat diet (HFD) and were orally administered 5 or 10 mg/kg BW of oligomer (6 kDa) chitosan (OC), low-molecular-weight (70 kDa) chitosan (LMC) or high-molecular-weight (200 kDa) chitosan (HMC) four times per week for 12 weeks. Animals receiving 2.5 mg/kg BW lovastatin (LOVA) served as a positive control. The blood lipid profiles of these control animals revealed that all chitosans and LOVA significantly decreased total triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol levels in a dose-dependent manner compared to the HFD-fed controls (P<0.05). The blood lipid lowering effectiveness of the three chitosans followed the order of LMC>OC>HMC. Hamsters receiving 5 and 10 mg/kg LMC (P<0.05) exhibited an increase in fecal fat content. Immunoblot assay revealed that acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-2 (ACAT-2) expression was suppressed in all chitosan-fed animals compared to the HFD-fed controls (P<0.05). These results suggest that chitosan effectively decreases blood lipid content, and its effectiveness depends on the molecular size of chitosan. The hypolipidemic effect of chitosan is partly attributed to its suppression of intestinal lipid absorption and hepatic ACAT-2 expression.

84863298355	Diallyl trisulfide suppresses the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through ERK activation	Garlic and its organosulfur compounds display hypolipidemic effects by inhibiting fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. We investigated the anti-adipogenic effect of diallyl trisulfide (DATS), the second most abundant organosulfide in garlic oil. We studied the effects of DATS in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and the mechanism involved in its action. DATS (0-75 μM) inhibited CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) α and β and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner, leading to a decrease of fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression and lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells. Insulin treatment induced a transient increase in ERK phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and maximal induction was observed at 5. min and then declined. DATS, however, sustained ERK phosphorylation up to 120. min. In the presence of PD98059, the phosphorylation of ERK and suppression of PPARγ expression and DNA binding activity of PPARγ by DATS were reversed, and lipid accumulation was restored. In conclusion, these results indicate that DATS inhibits the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. DATS is likely to act by prolonging ERK activation, which leads to the down-regulation of adipogenic transcription factor expression during adipogenesis. Our results suggest that garlic may have potential as an anti-obesity agent. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84863248220	Effect of garlic sulfur compounds on neutrophil infiltration and damage to the intestinal mucosa by endotoxin in rats	We investigated the protective effects of garlic sulfur compounds (GSCs), specifically, diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), on endotoxin-induced intestinal damage. Wistar rats received by gavage 0.125 or 0.025. mmol/kg body wt of each GSC or the vehicle (corn oil; 2. mL/kg body wt) every other day for 2. weeks before being injected with endotoxin (ip, 5. mg/kg body wt). Control rats were administered corn oil and were injected with sterile saline. Rats were killed at 18. h after injection. Both doses of DAS suppressed endotoxin-induced neutrophilia, serum levels of sICAM-1 and CINC-1, cellular CD11b on neutrophils, and intestinal contents of ICAM-1, CINC-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta (p< 0.05). DADS suppressed endotoxin-induced intestinal contents of ICAM-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta at both doses, but only suppressed the serum sICAM-1 level and cellular CD11b on neutrophils at the low dose (p< 0.05). DATS did not ameliorate the endotoxin-induced serum level of sICAM-1 or CINC-1 but suppressed intestinal IL-1beta at both doses. The low but not the high dose of DATS also ameliorated the intestinal contents of ICAM-1 and TNF-alpha (p< 0.05). All GSCs reversed endotoxin-induced neutrophil infiltration and damage in the intestine, and the order of the effects of these GSCs to normalize intestinal morphology was DAS > DADS > DATS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

84863464724	Activation of Nrf2 is required for up-regulation of the π class of glutathione S-transferase in rat primary hepatocytes with l-methionine starvation	Numerous genes expression is regulated in response to amino acid shortage, which helps organisms adapt to amino acid limitation. The expression of the π class of glutathione (GSH) S-transferase (GSTP), a highly inducible phase II detoxification enzyme, is regulated mainly by activates activating protein 1 (AP-1) binding to the enhancer I of GSTP (GPEI). Here we show the critical role of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in up-regulating GSTP gene transcription. Primary rat hepatocytes were cultured in a methionine-restricted medium, and immunoblotting and RT-PCR analyses showed that methionine restriction time-dependently increased GSTP protein and mRNA expression over a 48 h period. Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus, nuclear proteins binding to GPEI, and antioxidant response element (ARE) luciferase reporter activity were increased by methionine restriction as well as by l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a GSH synthesis inhibitor. Transfection with Nrf2 siRNA knocked down Nrf2 expression and reversed the methionine-induced GSTP expression and GPEI binding activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of Nrf2 to the GPEI. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) was increased in methionine-restricted and BSO-treated cells. ERK2 siRNA abolished methionine restriction-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, GPEI binding activity, ARE-luciferase reporter activity, and GSTP expression. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of GSTP gene transcription in response to methionine restriction likely occurs via the ERK-Nrf2-GPEI signaling pathway. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

0037210706	Relationship between intracellular glutathione level and the mode of cell death induced by pingyangmycin	The effects of intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration on the toxicity of pingyangmycin in human squamous cell carcinoma cell line were evaluated. By using the GSH synthesis inhibitor D,L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine and the precursor of cysteine 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ), intracellular glutathione levels were artificially changed. After exposed to different GSH concentrations cultured tumor cells were treated with pingyangmycin and the resultant mode of cell death was analyzed using morphological and biochemical criteria. It was found that the toxicity of pingyangmycin was obviously increased to cultured tumor cells on lowering GSH levels, with the mode of cell death switching from necrosis to apoptosis. In contract, treatment with OTZ increased GSH level compared with that of control cells, inhibited cell death induced by pingyangmycin via a necrotic rather than apoptotic process. These observations suggest that modulation of GSH levels effects the toxicity of pingyangmycin and that GSH influences the mode of cell death induced by pingyangmycin. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

0037321247	The combined effects of garlic oil and fish oil on the hepatic antioxidant and drug-metabolizing enzymes of rats	This present study was designed to investigate the combined modulatory effect of garlic oil (GO) and fish oil (FO) on the antioxidant and drug metabolism systems. Rats were fed either a low-maize oil (MO) diet (50 g MO/kg), high-MO diet (235 g MO/kg) or high-FO diet (205 g FO + 30 g MO/kg) and received different doses of GO (0-200 mg/kg body weight) three times per week for 6 weeks. Fatty acid analysis showed that 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 were incorporated into serum lipid at the expense of 18:2n-6 and 20:4n-6 in rats fed the high-FO diet. GO dose-dependently increased hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activities, but decreased glutathione peroxidase and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMAD) activities (P<0.05). With the exception of glutathione peroxidase, the activities of glutathione reductase, SOD, GST, EROD and NDMAD were modulated by the dietary fat. The high-FO group had greater SOD and EROD activity than either MO-fed group; it also had greater NDMAD activity than the low-MO group (P<0.05). GST activity was higher in rats fed high-FO or high-MO diets than rats fed the low-MO diet. Change in erythromycin demethylase activity, however, was not caused by either dietary fat or GO. Immunoblot assay showed that GO dose-dependently enhanced the protein level of the Ya, Yb1, Yc isoenzymes of GST and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and 3A1, but GO suppressed CYP2E1 expression. Regardless of the dosage of GO, the high-FO diet increased CYP1A1, CYP3A1 and CYP2E1 levels compared with the high- and low-MO diets. Accompanying the changes observed in immunoblots, CYP1A1 and CYP3A1 mRNA levels were increased by GO in a dose-dependent manner and also increased additively in combination with FO feeding. These present results indicate that co-administration of GO and FO modulates the antioxidant and drug-metabolizing capacity of animals and that the effect of GO and FO on drug-metabolizing enzymes is additive.

0037116438	Differential effects of garlic oil and its three major organosulfur components on the hepatic detoxification system in rats	The objective of this study was to compare the modulatory effect of garlic oil and its three organosulfur compounds, diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), on rat hepatic detoxification enzyme activity, and protein and mRNA expression. Rats were orally administered garlic oil (80 or 200 mg/kg bw), DAS (20 or 80 mg/kg bw), DADS (80 mg/kg bw), or DATS (70 mg/kg bw) three times a week for 6 weeks. Control rats received corn oil. According to the results, garlic oil and DAS in dosages of 200 and 80 mg/kg bw, respectively, significantly increased pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity as compared with the that of the control rats (P < 0.05). In contrast, N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase activity in rats that received DADS and DATS was significantly lower than that in the control rats (P < 0.05). Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and erythromycin demethylase activities were not influenced by garlic oil, DAS, DADS, or DATS. To the phase II enzyme, garlic oil, DADS, and DATS significantly increased the glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity toward ethacrynic acid (P < 0.05). Immunoblot assay showed that the protein contents of cytochrome P450 1A1, 2B1, and 3A1 were increased by garlic oil and each of three allyl sulfides, and the change among the allyl sulfides was in the order of DAS > DADS > DATS. The placental form of GST (PGST) level was also increased by garlic oil and the three allyl sulfides, but the increase among the allyl sulfides was DATS ≅ DADS > DAS. P450 2E1, however, was suppressed by each garlic component. Northern blot results indicated that the changes in P450 1A1, 2B1, 3A1, and PGST mRNA levels by garlic components were similar to those noted in the protein levels. These results indicate that the modulatory effect of garlic oil on hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes can be attributed to its three major allyl sulfide components DAS, DADS, and DATS. These three allyl sulfides vary in modulatory activity, and this variation is related to the number of sulfur atoms in the molecule.

0037494974	Down-regulation of heat shock protein 27 in neuronal cells and non-neuronal cells expressing mutant ataxin-3	Machado-Joseph disease (MJD)/spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is an autosomal dominant spinocerebellar degeneration characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations. Unstable CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the MJD gene has been identified as the pathologic mutation of MJD. In this study, human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with full-length MJD with 78 CAG repeats were established. Compared with the parental cells, cells expressing mutant ataxin-3 displayed normal morphology for over 80 generations. Less than 1% of the transfected cells contained nuclear aggregates under basal conditions, indicating that this cellular model represented an early disease stage. While t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) was used to assess the oxidative tolerance of cells, the results demonstrated that the transfected cells were more susceptible to low concentrations of TBH than the parental cells. Most interestingly, from 2D gel electrophoresis analysis, we identified that the expression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), known as a suppressor of poly(Q)-mediated cell death, dramatically decreased in SK-N-SH cells stably transfected with full-length mutant MJD. The same reduction of HSP27 was further confirmed in lymphoblastoid cells from MJD patients. Our results demonstrated that both neuronal and non-neuronal cells with expanded full-length ataxin-3 revealed reduced protein expression of HSP27. We propose that the reduction of HSP27 in the early stage of the disease plays an important role during cell death process in MJD. © 2003 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

0037608968	Induction of c-fos expression by nicotine in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts is related to cellular thiol levels	Cigarette smoking is associated with increased incidence of periodontal disease and poor response to periodontal therapy. Several studies have shown the detrimental effects of nicotine on periodontal tissue. To investigate the molecular toxicological implications of cigarette smoking on periodontal tissue, expression of c-fos early stress response gene was examined in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) after exposure to nicotine. The exposure of quiescent human PDLFs to nicotine resulted in the induction of c-fos mRNA expression. The levels of the c-fos mRNAs increased about 2.5 and 4.8-fold after exposure to 2.5 mM and 10 mM nicotine for 2 h, respectively. Moreover, the peak of c-fos mRNA levels induced by nicotine was 5 mM at 2-h incubation period. Kinetic investigations of c-fos mRNA expression in nicotine-treated cells revealed a rapid accumulation of the transcript, a significant signal first detectable after 30 min of exposure. This increase was transient and the level of c-fos mRNAs returned rapidly to that of control cells by 8 h. To determine whether thiol levels were important in induction of c-fos by nicotine, we pretreated cells with the glutathione (GSH) precursor, 2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), to boost thiol levels, or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) to deplete GSH. Our results demonstrate that OTZ pretreatment decreased in c-fos mRNA level and BSO pretreatment enhanced in c-fos mRNA level after exposure to nicotine. In addition, nicotine significantly depleted intracellular GSH in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). At a concentration of 5 mM and 20 mM, nicotine depleted about 22.2% and 56% of GSH, respectively. Taken together, c-fos gene expression might be one signal transduction pathway linked to the induction of early response genes by cigarette smoking. These results suggest that the nicotine-dependent stress-specific expression of the c-fos gene correlates with cellular thiol levels in human PDLFs.

The present results demonstrated that pretreatment with DHA (50 and 100 μM) inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) protein, mRNA expression and promoter activity. In addition, TNF-α-stimulated inhibitory kappa B (IκB) kinase (IKK) phosphorylation, IκB phosphorylation and degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and DNA binding activity were attenuated by pretreatment with DHA. DHA triggered early-stage and transient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and significantly increased the protein expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), induced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation to the nucleus and up-regulated antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity. Moreover, DHA inhibited Nrf2 ubiquitination and proteasome activity. DHA activated Akt, p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and specific inhibitors of respective pathways attenuated DHA-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 expression. Transfection with HO-1 siRNA knocked down HO-1 expression and partially reversed the DHA-mediated inhibition of TNF-α-induced p65 nuclear translocation and ICAM-1 expression. Importantly, we show for the first time that HO-1 plays a down-regulatory role in NF-κB nuclear translocation, and inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitination and proteasome activity are involved in increased cellular Nrf2 level by DHA. In this study, we show that HO-1 plays a down-regulatory role in NF-κB nuclear translocation and that the protective effect of DHA against inflammation is partially via up-regulation of Nrf2-mediated HO-1 expression and inhibition of IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

84872333308	Protection by chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin against oxidative stress is mediated by the Nrf2-dependent up-regulation of heme oxygenase 1 and glutamate cysteine ligase in rat primary hepatocytes	Chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin are flavones that differ in their number of hydroxyl groups in the B ring. In this study, we investigated the protection by chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP)-induced oxidative stress and the possible mechanisms involved in rat primary hepatocytes. Chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin dose-dependently up-regulated the protein expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic (GCLC) and modifier subunit (GCLM) and increased the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content and the ratio of GSH to oxidized GSH. Among the flavones studied, chrysin showed the greatest induction of HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM protein expression and GSH content. Cellular reactive oxygen species production induced by tBHP was attenuated by pretreatment with chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin (P\.05), and this protection was reversed by the GCL inhibitor l-buthionine-S-sulfoximine and the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin. Chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation, nuclear Nrf2-antioxidant responsive element (ARE) binding activity, and ARE-dependent luciferase activity. Both ERK2 and Nrf2 siRNAs attenuated chrysininduced HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM protein expression. Taken together, these results suggest that chrysin, apigenin, and luteolin inhibit tBHP-induced oxidative stress by up-regulating HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM gene transcription via the ERK2/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathways in rat primary hepatocytes. © The Author(s) 2012.

84873670486	Suppressive effects of Indigofera suffruticosa Mill extracts on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory responses in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages	Indigofera suffruticosa Mill is used as an herbal medicine for the treatment of inflammation. The aim of this study is to assess the anti-inflammatory potency of I. suffruticosa and its likely molecular mechanisms of action in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. Both water and ethanolic extracts of I. suffruticosa significantly decreased LPS-induced nitric oxide (NO) as well as the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-α, and pro-interleukin-1β. Moreover, LPS-induced inhibitory factor-κB-α phosphorylation, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) nuclear protein-DNA binding affinity, and NF-κB reporter gene activity were dramatically inhibited by I. suffruticosa extracts. Exogenous addition of I. suffruticosa significantly induced heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, and the presence of HO-1 small interfering RNA partly reversed the inhibitory effects of I. suffruticosa on LPS-induced NO production and iNOS expression. Furthermore, I. suffruticosa induced HO-1 expression may be through activation of the ERK/nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 pathway. Eight phenolic compounds were found in the I. suffruticosa extracts, but salicylic acid was the only one detected in the plasma of mice fed with I. suffruticosa extracts. In summary, I. suffruticosa have a strong anti-inflammatory property that diminishes pro-inflammatory mediator expressions by lessening LPS-induced NF-κB activation and inducing HO-1 expression in macrophages. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84875578500	Methylglyoxal induces DNA crosslinks in ECV304 cells via a reactive oxygen species-independent protein carbonylation pathway	Methylglyoxal (MG) is a reactive dicarbonyl compound that is produced endogenously from glycolytic intermediates and via gluconeogenesis. Elevated MG levels in diabetes patients are believed to cause diabetic complications. MG-induced crosslinking products from the covalent binding of DNA or protein alone or together could be relevant to carcinogenesis and multiple complications in diabetes. However, the mechanisms governing DNA crosslink formation by MG are unclear. We investigated whether MG could induce DNA crosslinks in human ECV304 cells and the possible mechanism of this action. The level of DNA crosslinks and reactive oxygen species production were assayed by a modified alkaline Comet assay and a 2',7' dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCHF-DA) assay, respectively. MG caused a time- and dose-dependent increase in DNA crosslinks and a dose-dependent increase in protein carbonylation in ECV304 cells. Addition of 2. mM MG resulted in a transient increase in protein carbonylation, and this increase peaked within 2. h and then rapidly decreased. Most notably, MG did not cause significantly enhanced ROS generation in ECV304 cells. Co-treatment with carbonyl-scavenging drugs, such as aminoguanidine, N-acetyl-. l-cysteine, and glutathione, significantly inhibited the formation of DNA crosslinks by MG, whereas co-treatment with the antioxidant ascorbic acid did not. In conclusion, our results imply that MG induces DNA crosslink formation in ECV304 cells via a reactive oxygen species-independent protein carbonylation pathway. Our findings also suggest that non-toxic aminothiol antioxidants with carbonyl scavenging capabilities are potential therapeutic agent for MG-related diseases, such as diabetes and neurodegeneration. Furthermore, our findings also imply that DNA nonbinding proteins, bovine serum albumin might be able to crosslink calf thymus DNA in the presence of MG. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880511730	Sulforaphane inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration by reducing MMP-9 activity via the Ras and RhoA/ROCK pathways	Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration triggered by inflammatory stimuli are involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Here, we investigate the capacity of sulforaphane (SFN) on TNF-α-induced proliferation, migration and signal transduction in A7r5 smooth muscle cells. SFN inhibited the migration ability of A7r5 cells induced by TNF-α using wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. After treatment of SFN at various concentrations with TNF-α, A7r5 cell reduced matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression. Fluorescent phalloidin staining demonstrated that increased intense F-actin staining in the TNF-α-induced A7r5 cells was inhibited by SFN. The levels of Ras and RhoA/ROCK-related proteins in the TNF-α treated A7r5 cells were increased, whereas these protein expression were attenuated by SFN. The results suggested that SFN could mediate A7r5 cells migration by reducing MMP-9 activity involving the suppression of the Ras and RhoA signaling pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84880966080	Indigofera suffruticosa Mill extracts up-regulate the expression of the π class of glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H: Quinone oxidoreductase 1 in rat Clone 9 liver cells	Because induction of phase II detoxification enzyme is important for chemoprevention, we study the effects of Indigofera suffruticosa Mill, a medicinal herb, on the expression of π class of glutathione S-transferase (GSTP) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in rat Clone 9 liver cells. Both water and ethanolic extracts of I. suffruticosa significantly increased the expression and enzyme activities of GSTP and NQO1. I. suffruticosa extracts up-regulated GSTP promoter activity and the binding affinity of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) with the GSTP enhancer I oligonucleotide. Moreover, I. suffruticosa extracts increased nuclear Nrf2 accumulation as well as ARE transcriptional activity. The level of phospho-ERK was augmented by I. suffruticosa extracts, and the ERK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the I. suffruticosa extract-induced ERK activation and GSTP and NQO-1 expression. Moreover, I. suffruticosa extracts, especially the ethanolic extract increased the glutathione level in mouse liver and red blood cells as well as Clone 9 liver cells. The efficacy of I. suffruticosa extracts in induction of phase II detoxification enzymes and glutathione content implies that I. suffruticosa could be considered as a potential chemopreventive agent. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

84881493942	Induction of heme oxygenase-1 and inhibition of TPA-induced matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression by andrographolide in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis. Andrographolide (AP) is a diterpene lactone in the leaves and stem of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f) Ness that has been reported to possess anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the effect of AP on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13-acetate (TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and the possible mechanisms involved. The results showed that AP dose-dependently inhibited TPAinduced MMP-9 protein expression, enzyme activity, migration and invasion. In addition, AP significantly induced heme oxygenase- 1 (HO-1) messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression. Transfection with HO-1 small interfering RNA knocked down the HO-1 expression and reversed the inhibition of MMP-9 expression by AP. HO-1 end products, such as carbon monoxide, free iron and bilirubin, suppressed the TPA-induced MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression, enzyme activity, migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, TPA-induced extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation and the DNA binding activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) were attenuated by pretreatment with AP and HO-1 end products. In conclusion, these results suggest that AP inhibits TPA-induced cell migration and invasion by reducing MMP-9 activation, which is mediated mainly by inhibition of the ERK1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathways and subsequent AP-1 and NF-κB transactivation. Additionally, induction of HO-1 expression is at least partially involved in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 activation and cell migration in MCF-7 cells by AP. © The Author 2013.

84884260050	Andrographis paniculata extract and andrographolide modulate the hepatic drug metabolism system and plasma tolbutamide concentrations in rats	Andrographolide is the most abundant terpenoid of A. paniculata which is used in the treatment of diabetes. In this study, we investigated the effects of A. paniculata extract (APE) and andrographolide on the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes in rat liver and determined whether modulation of these enzymes changed the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide. Rats were intragastrically dosed with 2 g/kg/day APE or 50 mg/kg/day andrographolide for 5 days before a dose of 20 mg/kg tolbutamide was given. APE and andrographolide reduced the AUC 0 - 12 h of tolbutamide by 37% and 18%, respectively, compared with that in controls. The protein and mRNA levels and enzyme activities of CYP2C6/11, CYP1A1/2, and CYP3A1/2 were increased by APE and andrographolide. To evaluate whether APE or andrographolide affected the hypoglycemic action of tolbutamide, high-fat diet-induced obese mice were used and treated in the same manner as the rats. APE and andrographolide increased CYP2C6/11 expression and decreased plasma tolbutamide levels. In a glucose tolerance test, however, the hypoglycemic effect of tolbutamide was not changed by APE or andrographolide. These results suggest that APE and andrographolide accelerate the metabolism rate of tolbutamide through increased expression and activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes. APE and andrographolide, however, do not impair the hypoglycemic effect of tolbutamide. © 2013 Haw-Wen Chen et al.

84886792157	Isothiocyanates protect against oxidized LDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by upregulating Nrf2-dependent antioxidation and suppressing NFκB activation	Scope: Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a key contributor to atherogenesis through multiple mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the protection by three structurally related isothiocyanates, i.e., sulforaphane (SFN), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), and phenethyl isocyanate (PEITC), against oxLDL-induced leukocyte adhesion to vascular endothelium and the mechanism involved. Methods and results: The protection against oxLDL-induced endothelial dysfunction by isothiocyanates was studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). oxLDL increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, stimulated nuclear factor-kappaB (NFκB) activation, and enhanced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin expression in HUVECs, which led to promotion of monocyte adhesion to HUVECs. Treatment with SFN, BITC, and PEITC (0-10 μM) dose-dependently induced heme oxygenase (HO)-1, glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic and modifier subunit expression, intracellular glutathione content, and antioxidant response element (ARE)-luciferase reporter activity. SFN, BITC, and PEITC pretreatment reversed oxLDL-induced ROS production, NFκB nuclear translocation, κB-reporter activity, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression, and monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. Both heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) knockdown attenuated the isothiocyanate inhibition of oxLDL-induced ROS production, κB-reporter activity, and adhesion molecule expression. Conclusion: SFN, BITC, and PEITC protect against oxLDL-induced endothelial damage by upregulating Nrf2-dependent HO-1 and GCL expression, which leads to inhibition of NFκB activation and ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

84886924428	Inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression by docosahexaenoic acid mediated by heme oxygenase 1 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced MCF-7 human breast cancer cells	Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) plays a crucial role in tumor metastasis. Previous studies showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids exhibit an anti-cancer effect in various human carcinoma cells, but the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and linoleic acid (LA) on metastasis of breast cancer cells is not fully clarified. We studied the anti-metastasis potential of DHA and LA in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13-acetate (TPA)-induced MCF-7 cells. We found that TPA (100 ng/ml) induced MMP-9 enzyme activity both dose- and time-dependently, and 200 μM DHA and LA significantly inhibited MMP-9 mRNA and protein expression, enzyme activity, cell migration, and invasion. Treatment with PD98059 (10 μM), wortmannin (10 μM), and GF109203X (0.5 μM) decreased TPAinduced MMP-9 protein expression and enzyme activity. TPA-induced activation of ERK1, Akt, and PKCδ was attenuated by DHA, whereas LA attenuated only ERK1 activation. GF109203X also suppressed ERK1 activation. EMSA showed that DHA, LA, PD98059, and wortmannin decreased TPA-induced NF-κB and AP-1 DNA-binding activity. Furthermore, DHA rather than LA dose-dependently increased HO-1 expression. HO-1 siRNA alleviated the inhibition by DHA of TPA-induced MMP-9 protein expression and enzyme activity in MCF-7 cells, and HO-1 knockdown reversed the DHA inhibition of cell migration. These results suggest that DHA and LA have both similar and divergent signaling pathways in the suppression of TPA-induced MCF-7 metastasis. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

0344012654	Oxidative stress-related alteration of the copy number of mitochondrial DNA in human leukocytes	The role of oxidative stress in the regulation of the copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in human leukocytes is unclear. In this study, we investigated the redox factors in plasma that may contribute to the alteration of mtDNA copy number in human leukocytes. A total of 156 healthy subjects of 25-80 years of age who exhibited no significant difference in the distribution of subpopulations of leukocytes in blood were recruited. Small-molecular-weight antioxidants and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 4,977 bp deletion of mtDNA in leukocytes were determined. The mtDNA copy number in leukocytes was determined by real-time PCR. The results showed that the copy number of mtDNA in leukocytes was changed with age in a biphasic manner that fits in a positively quadratic regression model (P = 0.001). Retinol (P = 0.005), non-protein thiols (P = 0.001) and ferritin (P = 0.004) in plasma and total glutathione in erythrocytes (P = 0.046) were the significant redox factors that correlated with the mtDNA copy number in leukocytes in a positive manner. By contrast, α-tocopherol levels in plasma (P = 0.001) and erythrocytes (P = 0.033) were negatively correlated with the mtDNA copy number in leukocytes. Three oxidative indices including the incidence of 4,977 bp deletion of mtDNA (P = 0.016) and 8-OHdG content in leukocytes (P = 0.003) and TBARS in plasma (P = 0.001) were all positively correlated with the copy number of mtDNA in leukocytes. Taken these findings together, we suggest that the copy number of mtDNA in leukocytes is affected by oxidative stress in blood circulation elicited by the alteration of plasma antioxidants/prooxidants and oxidative damage to DNA.

84891660930	The antidiabetic effect of garlic oil is associated with ameliorated oxidative stress but not ameliorated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats	Oxidative stress and inflammatory condition has been broadly accepted being associated with the progression of diabetes. On the other hand, garlic ( dà suàn, bulb of Allium sativum) has been shown to possess both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action in several clinical conditions. Our previous study demonstrated that treatment with garlic oil improves oral glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance and improves the insulin-stimulated utilization of glucose to synthesize glycogen in skeletal muscle in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes, in vivo and ex vivo, respectively. The aim of the present study is to investigate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of garlic oil (GO) in the skeletal muscle of diabetic rats. Rats with STZ-induced diabetes received GO (10, 50, or 100 mg/kg body weight) or corn oil by gavage every other day for 3 weeks. Control rats received corn oil only. GO dose-dependently improved insulin sensitivity, as assessed by the insulin tolerance test, and oral glucose tolerance. GO significantly elevated total glutathione and glutathione peroxidase activity and lowered the nitrate/nitrite content in skeletal muscle at 50 and 100 mg/kg and significantly elevated glutathione reductase activity and lowered lipid peroxidation at 100 mg/kg. By contrast, GO did not reverse diabetes-induced elevation of IL-1β and TNF- in skeletal muscle at any tested dose. On the other hand, GO elevated the expression of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle along with glycogen content as observed with PAS staining. In conclusion, the antidiabetic effect of garlic oil is associated with ameliorated oxidative stress in skeletal muscle. Copyright © 2011 Committee on Chinese Medicine and Pharmacy, Taiwan.

DC. ether extract (GBEE) on nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin (PG)E <inf>2</inf> production on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells. A composition analysis of GBEE showed that the major compounds were b-carotene, chlorophyll, and quercetin, respectively. Furthermore, NO and PGE <inf>2</inf> levels of 120 μg/ml GBEE-treated cells were 70% and 9.8%, respectively, than those of cells treated with LPS alone. Immunoblots assays showed that the GBEE dose-dependently suppressed LPS-induced inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein levels. The GBEE significantly decreased cytosolic phosphorylated (p)-IκBa and nuclear p65 protein expressions. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays indicated that the GBEE effectively inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation induced by LPS. These results support a role of the GBEE in suppressing activation of NF-κB to inhibit NO and PGE<inf>2</inf> production in the LPS-induced inflammatory response by RAW 264.7 cells.

84894569322	Induction of nrf2-dependent antioxidation and protection against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage by andrographis herba (chuan xin lian)ethanolic extract	Andrographis paniculata is a traditional Chinese herb and displays diverse biological activities including antioxidation, anti-tumorigenesis, anti-virus, and anti-atherogenesis. In this study, we investigated the up-regulation of ethanolic extract of A. paniculata (APE) on the antioxidant defense in rat livers and whether this enhancement protected against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver damage. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered (i.g.) 0, 0.75, or 2 g/kg/d APE for 5 d. At d 6, rats were sacrificed and liver tissues were removed. Some animals (n=8) were intraperitoneally injected CCl4 (1 mL/kg, 50% in olive oil) and blood was drawn 24 h after CCl4 treatment. The results showed that APE increased hepatic glutathione (GSH) content and superoxide dismutase, GSH peroxidase, and GSH S-transferase activities in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). Results of immunoblotting and RT-PCR revealed that rats treated with APE had higher glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic and modifier subunits, heme oxygenase 1, superoxide dismutase 1, and GSH S-transferase Ya and Yb protein and mRNA expression than those of control rats. Moreover, APE increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation and Nrf2 binding to DNA in rat liver. In the presence of CCl4, APE decreased hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances production and plasma aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities. These results suggest that APE protection against CCl4 insult is attributed, at least in part, to its up-regulation of antioxidant defense in rat liver.

84900308435	Docosahexaenoic acid inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced cell migration via the GPR120/PP2A/ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway in human umbilical vein endothelial cells	Cell migration plays an important role in angiogenesis and wound repair. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is essential for endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo. This study investigated the molecular mechanism by which DHA down-regulates VEGF-induced cell migration. HUVECs were used as the study model, and the MTT assay, Western blot, wound-healing assay, and phosphatase activity assay were used to explore the effects of DHA on cell migration. GPR120 is the putative receptor for DHA action. The results showed that DHA, PD98059 (an ERK1/2 inhibitor), and GW9508 (a GPR120 agonist) inhibited VEGF-induced cell migration. In contrast, pretreatment with okadaic acid (OA, a PP2A inhibitor) and S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (an NO donor) reversed the inhibition of cell migration by DHA. VEGF-induced cell migration was accompanied by phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS. Treatment of HUVECs with DHA increased PP2A enzyme activity and decreased VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and eNOS. However, pretreatment with OA significantly decreased DHA-induced PP2A enzyme activity and reversed the DHA inhibition of VEGF-induced ERK1/2 and eNOS phosphorylation. These results suggest that stimulation of PP2A activity and inhibition of the VEGF-induced ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway may be involved in the DHA suppression of VEGF-induced cell migration. Thus, the effect of DHA on angiogenesis and wound repair is at least partly by virtue of its attenuation of cell migration. © 2014 American Chemical Society.

Male Wistar rats were fed a laboratory chow diet and GT or BT drink for 5. weeks. Control rats received de-ionized water instead of the tea drinks. Rats received the GT and BT drinks treatment for 5. weeks showed a significant increase in hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and CYP1A2, and a significant decrease in CYP2C, CYP2E1 and CYP3A enzyme activities. Results of immunoblot analyses of enzyme protein contents showed the same trend with enzyme activity. Significant increase in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and reduced glutathione content in liver and lungs were observed in rats treated with both tea drinks. A lower lipid peroxide level in lungs was observed in rats treated with GT drink. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that both tea drinks decreased pregnane X receptor binding to DNA and increased nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 binding to DNA. These results suggest that feeding of both tea drinks to rats modulated DME activities and reduced oxidative stress in liver and lungs. GT drink is more effective on reducing oxidative stress than BT drink. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of andrographolide in rats and studied whether andrographolide enhances antioxidant defense in a variety of tissues and protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced oxidative damage. After a single 50-mg/kg administration, the maximum plasma concentration of andrographolide was 1μM which peaked at 30min. The bioavailability of andrographolide was 1.19%. In a hepatoprotection study, rats were intragastrically dosed with 30 or 50mg/kg andrographolide for 5 consecutive days.

84911886716	Sulforaphane inhibits TNF-α-induced adhesion molecule expression through the rho A/ROCK/NF-κB signaling pathway	Endothelial dysfunction is an early indicator of cardiovascular diseases. Increased stimulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) triggers the inflammatory mediator secretion of endothelial cells, leading to atherosclerotic risk. In this study, we investigated whether sulforaphane (SFN) affected the expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in TNF-α-induced ECV 304 endothelial cells. Our data showed that SFN attenuated TNF-α-induced expression of ICAM-1 in ECV 304 cells. Pretreatment of ECV 304 cells with SFN inhibited dose-dependently the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-8. SFN inhibited TNF-α-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity. Furthermore, SFN decreased TNF-α-mediated phosphorylation of IκB kinase (IKK) and IκBα, Rho A, ROCK, ERK1/2, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels. Collectively, SFN inhibited the NF-κB DNA binding activity and downregulated the TNF-α-mediated induction of ICAM-1 in endothelial cells by inhibiting the Rho A/ROCK/NF-κB signaling pathway, suggesting the beneficial effects of SFN on suppression of inflammation within the atherosclerotic lesion.
