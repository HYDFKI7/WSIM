23244437608	Effects of interface kinetics and anisotropy on the stability of the growing crystal face and dissolution face during crystallization from solution under microgravity	The stability of the shapes of the growing crystal face and dissolution face in a two-dimensional mathematical model of crystal growth from solution under microgravity is studied. Effects of the interface kinetics and anisotropy of crystallization and dissolution on the stability are also studied. It is proved that the stable shapes of crystal growth face and dissolution face do exist, which are of suitably shaped curves with their upper parts inclined backward properly no matter whether the interface kinetics and the anisotropy are taken into account or not. The stable shapes of the growing crystal faces and dissolution faces are calculated for various cases. The interface kinetics will make the inclination degree of stable crystal growth face reduce and that of stable dissolution face reduce slightly. The anisotropy of crystallization and dissolution may make the inclination degree of stable-growing crystal face smaller or larger, and that of the stable dissolution face varies very slightly. © 2004 Chin.

33745220526	Liquid-phase-epitaxy-grown in Asx Sb1-x GaAs for room-temperature 8-12 μm infrared detectors	High-quality In Asx Sb1-x (0<x≤0.3) films are grown on GaAs substrates by liquid phase epitaxy and electrical and optical properties of the films are investigated, revealing that the films exhibit Hall mobilities higher than 2× 104 cm2 V-1 s-1 and cutoff wavelengths longer than 10 μm at room temperature (RT). Photoconductors are fabricated from the films, and notable photoresponses beyond 8 μm are observed at RT. In particular, for an In As0.3 Sb0.7 film, a photoresponse of up to 13 μm with a maximum responsivity of 0.26 VW is obtained at RT.

84887940944	Impedance immunosensor based on interdigitated array microelectrodes for rapid detection of avian influenza virus subtype H5	An impedance immunosensor based on interdigitated array microelectrodes (IDAMs) was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H5. The surface of the gold microelectrodes was modified with protein A and then immobilized with monoclonal antibodies against an epitope in the hemagglutinin (HA) of AIV H5 subtype. The binding of H5 subtype viruses onto the antibody-modified microelectrodes surface resulted in a change in the impedance, which was measured in a frequency range of 20 Hz to 1 MHz in the presence of 10 mM [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- as a redox probe. An equivalent circuit was introduced to interpret the impedance spectra of this immunosensor system. Experimental and fitting impedance spectra were well matched. The results showed that the binding of AIV H5N1 to the modified microelectrodes surface significantly increased the electron transfer resistance. A linear relationship between the change of the electron transfer resistance and the logarithmic value of H5N1 virus concentration was found in the range of 21 to 25 HA unit/50 l. The detection limit was 21 HA unit/50 l and the detection time was 1 h. This impedance immunosensor was specific to H5 subtype virus (H5N1) as no detectable signals were generated in the detection of non-target viruses such as AIV H9 subtype and Newcastle disease virus.

It is demonstrated that only a transverse-electric mode is guided for a ratio of slab height to rib height h/H = 0.5. Thus, these microring/racetrack resonators can only function for quasi-transverse-electric mode, while they get rid of transverse-magnetic polarization. Electron beam lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching were employed and improved to reduce sidewall roughness for low propagation loss and high performance resonators. Then, the effects of waveguide dimensions, coupling region design, waveguide roughness, and oxide cladding for the resonators have been considered and analyzed. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike the conventional process of simply depositing the hot silica on silicon waveguides, two successive layers of silicon dioxide were grown on etched SSC structures by PECVD (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition). The two layers have 0. 8% index contrast and supply stronger cladding for an incident light beam. Additionally, this process is able to reduce the effective refractive index of the input mode to less than 1.47 (extremely close to that of the fiber), substantially weakening the unwanted back reflection.

Through-port responses in an add-drop MR are analyzed by simulations and large extinctions are found when the MR is near-critically coupled. Accurate fabrication techniques are applied in producing a series of 20 μm-radii add-drop microrings with drop-side gap-widths in slight differences. A through-port extinction of about 42.7 dB is measured in an MR with through- and drop-side gap-width to be respectively 280nm and 295nm. The large extinction suggests about a 20.5 dB improvement from the symmetrical add-drop MR of the same size and the through-side gap-width.

The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations. Over the 100 nm wavelength range measured, the output uniformity is better than 0.2 dB. A low and flat excess loss of about 0.3 dB per splitter is obtained, with a variation below 0.2 dB. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84881273676	Fabrication of SU8-based chip suitable for genomic sequencing	DNA sequencing technology has markedly advanced the development of biological and medicinal sciences. High-throughput pyrosequencing instruments that combine the pyrosequencing with microfabricated high-density picoliter reactors have been proved to be suitable for de novo sequencing and metagenome sequencing. In the present work, we report on an alternative sequencing chip consisting of hundreds of thousands of picoliter sized honeycombed SU8 reaction vessels on a fiber-optic slide by lithography technique for high-throughput pyrosequencing instruments. Highly reproducible fabrication process of SU8 sequencing chip is achieved through the improvement on SU8 film thickness uniformity and relaxation of SU8 residual stress during fabrication. To achieve the optical isolation required for SU8 reaction wells, metal film is selectively deposited on the side walls of the reaction vessels by reformating vacuum coating. With the metal coating, the average value of optical cross talking between SU8 reaction vessels is reduced from 25% to 1%. The SU8 sequencing chip demonstrates an excellent light transmission characteristic and meets the need of pyrosequencing application. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

84885067697	Nonblocking 4×4 silicon electro-optic switch matrix with push-pull drive	A compact rearrangeable nonblocking 4 × 4 silicon electro-optic switch matrix based on a Spanke-Beneš network is proposed and fabricated by a 0.18 μm standard commercial complementary metal-oxide semiconductor line. By respectively modulating the two modulation arms with a push-pull drive, a cross talk (CT) of less than -18 dB is obtained for the switching element with 150-μm-long modulation arms. The total steady-state power consumption of the switch matrix ranges from 4.46 to 35.92mWfor different routing states. The CT values of the routing state with the minimum and maximum power consumptions are less than -19 dB and less than -12 dB, respectively. © 2013 Optical Society of America.

84885153747	Demonstration of a highly efficient multimode interference based silicon waveguide crossing	We present the design, fabrication and characterization of a highly efficient silicon waveguide crossing based on multimode interference (MMI). The crossing is formed by only one step etching with the grating couplers on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. High transmission efficiency of 98.5% (loss of -0.07 dB) and low crosstalk (<-43 dB) are predicted by the 3D FDTD simulation. Our experiment results showed good agreement with the simulation and, loss of -0.1 dB per crossing, and crosstalk better than -40 dB was obtained over a broad optical spectrum from 1520 nm to 1580 nm. Such a low loss, low crosstalk waveguide crossing is suitable for future on-chip optical interconnect. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84885345231	The progress of silicon-based grating couplers	Silicon-based photonic integrated chips recently have attracted great attention and actively intervened in many applications such as optical communications, optical interconnects, and optical sensing for relevant research institutions. Photonic integrated circuits are the key block to build information infrastructures. Among of them, grating couplers play an important role in silicon photonics, due to high efficient optical coupling on/off photonic chips. Also, they have many advantages in high density photonic packaging and on-wafer testing, such as large alignment tolerances and no requirements for wafer scribing or chip polishing. This review focuses on the principles and performances of grating couplers on silicon-on-insulator substrates. In this article, we also discuss the state-of-art and the trends in the near future, with a summary of our achievements over the last few years. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society.

0042108019	Effect of thermal annealing on optical emission properties of low-temperature grown AlGaAs/GaAs multiple quantum wells	We have investigated the effect of thermal annealing on optical emission properties of low-temperature (LT) grown AlGaAs/GaAs multiple quantum wells (MQWs) by using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. For comparison, the results on normal-temperature (NT) grown MQWs implanted with protons are also presented. The LT sample was grown by molecular beam epitaxy at 310°C. The as-grown LT-MQWs show moderately strong PL. Upon annealing at 600°C, the PL intensity of the LT-MQWs is dramatically quenched, in sharp contrast to the large increase in PL intensity of the implanted NT-MQWs. The quenching of PL intensity in the LT-MQWs is attributed to the formation of arsenic clusters that fast trap photoexcited carriers. In addition, an enhancement in the interface intermixing and roughening induced by thermal annealing has also been observed in the LT-MQWs. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.

0042470933	An emulation system for melting zone semiconductor single crystal growth in space	In situ monitoring and controlling the space experiments is an effective method to enhance the success probabilities of space experiments. A system to emulate the monitoring and controlling process of the semiconductor crystal growth by melting-zone in space has been built up. The system mainly contains three parts, that are a remote crystal growth furnace, a numerical simulation software package and local controlling and displaying center. The temperature distribution data of the furnace were transmitted to the ground control center for the numerical simulation program as the boundary conditions. The crystal growth process and crystal growth parameters including crystal growth rate, the width of melting-zone, the shape of the interfaces between crystal and melt, and the temperature gradient at the interface, etc. will be calculated with the simulation program. The theoretical calculation results of the crystal growth process will be then clearly displayed on the ground control terminal with image technique. The growth parameters were also displayed on the screen. Scientists can in situ observe the experiment progress. If the experiment process deviate from the programmed profile, the central control terminal can adjust the heating program of the space furnace to fulfill the requirements. The whole system can successfully emulate the crystal growth process.

84889646911	Improved picoliter-sized micro-reactors for high-throughput biological analysis	High-throughput pyrosequencing, carried out in millions of picoliter-sized reactors on a fiber-optic slide, is known for its longer read length. However, both optical crosstalk (which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio of CCD images) and chemical retention adversely affect the accuracy of chemiluminescence determination, and ultimately decrease the read length and the accuracy of pyrosequencing results. In this study, both titanium and oxidized aluminum films were deposited on the side walls and upper faces of micro-reactor slides to enhance optical isolation; the films reduced the inter-well crosstalk by one order of magnitude. Subsequently, chemical retention was shown to be caused by the lower diffusion coefficient of the side walls of the picoliter-sized reactors because of surface roughness and random pores. Optically isolated fiber-optic slides over-coated with silicon oxide showed smoother surface morphology, resulting in little chemical retention; this was further confirmed with theoretical calculations. Picoliter-sized micro-reactors coated with titanium-silicon oxide films showed the least inter-well optical crosstalk and chemical retention; these properties are expected to greatly improve the high-throughput pyrosequencing performance. © 2013 The Author(s).

84905859572	A novel picoliter droplet array for parallel real-time polymerase chain reaction based on double-inkjet printing	We developed and characterized a novel picoliter droplet-in-oil array generated by a double-inkjet printing method on a uniform hydrophobic silicon chip specifically designed for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Double-inkjet printing was proposed to efficiently address the evaporation issues of picoliter droplets during array generation on a planar substrate without the assistance of a humidifier or glycerol. The method utilizes piezoelectric inkjet printing equipment to precisely eject a reagent droplet into an oil droplet, which had first been dispensed on a hydrophobic and oleophobic substrate. No evaporation, random movement, or cross-contamination was observed during array fabrication and thermal cycling. We demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel double-inkjet method for real-time PCR analysis. This method can readily produce multivolume droplet-in-oil arrays with volume variations ranging from picoliters to nanoliters. This feature would be useful for simultaneous multivolume PCR experiments aimed at wide and tunable dynamic ranges. These double-inkjet-based picoliter droplet arrays may have potential for multiplexed applications that require isolated containers for single-cell cultures, single molecular enzymatic assays, or digital PCR and provide an alternative option for generating droplet arrays on planar substrates without chemical patterning. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

84906083429	High-speed silicon modulator with band equalization	Electro-optic modulation up to 70 Gbit/s has been demonstrated using a silicon Mach-Zehnder modulator with a bias voltage of -1.5 V. In a wide frequency range from DC, an increasing input impedance of the modulator was designed to equalize its electro-optic frequency response. Without a bias voltage, the 3 dB bandwidth was measured as 35 GHz and it is predicted to be as high as 55 GHz at -3 V bias. Frequency responses of the modulator operated with counter-propagating waves were tested to verify the proposed prediction model. © 2014 Optical Society of America.

84911061607	High-efficiency focusing grating coupler with optimized ultra-short taper	A novel high-efficiency focusing non-uniform grating coupler is proposed to couple light into or off silicon photonic chips for large-scale silicon photonic integration. This kind of grating coupler decreases the transition length of the linking taper between the grating and the single-mode waveguide by at least 80%. The radian of the grating lines and the size of the taper are optimized to improve the coupling efficiency. An experimental coupling efficiency of ∼ 68% at 1556.24 nm is obtained after optimization and the whole size of the grating is 12 μm × 30 μm, with a very short taper transition of ∼15 μm long.
