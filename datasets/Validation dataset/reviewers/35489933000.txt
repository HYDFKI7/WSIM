84927581511	SUVR2 is involved in transcriptional gene silencing by associating with SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling proteins in Arabidopsis	The SU(VAR)3-9-like histone methyltransferases usually catalyze repressive histone H3K9 methylation and are involved in transcriptional gene silencing in eukaryotic organisms. We identified a putative SU(VAR)3-9-like histone methyltransferase SUVR2 by a forward genetic screen and demonstrated that it is involved in transcriptional gene silencing at genomic loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We found that SUVR2 has no histone methyltransferase activity and the conserved catalytic sites of SUVR2 are dispensable for the function of SUVR2 in transcriptional silencing. SUVR2 forms a complex with its close homolog SUVR1 and associate with three previously uncharacterized SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling proteins CHR19, CHR27, and CHR28. SUVR2 was previously thought to be a component in the RdDM pathway. We demonstrated that SUVR2 contributes to transcriptional gene silencing not only at a subset of RdDM target loci but also at many RdDM-independent target loci. Our study suggests that the involvement of SUVR2 in transcriptional gene silencing is related to nucleosome positioning mediated by its associated chromatin-remodeling proteins.

33750112777	Improved immobilized metal affinity chromatography for large-scale phosphoproteomics applications	Dysregulated protein phosphorylation is a primary culprit in multiple physiopathological states. Hence, although analysis of signaling cascades on a proteome-wide scale would provide significant insight into both normal and aberrant cellular function, such studies are simultaneously limited by sheer biological complexity and concentration dynamic range. In principle, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) represents an ideal enrichment method for phosphoproteomics. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that this technique is not widely and successfully applied beyond analysis of simple standards, gel bands, and targeted protein immunoprecipitations. Here, we report significant improvements in IMAC-based methodology for enrichment of phosphopeptides from complex biological mixtures. Moreover, we provide detailed explanation for key variables that in our hands most influenced the outcome of these experiments. Our results indicate 5-to 10-fold improvement in recovery of singly- and multiply phosphorylated peptide standards in addition to significant improvement in the number of high-confidence phosphopeptide sequence assignments from global analysis of cellular lysate. In addition, we quantitatively track phosphopeptide recovery as a function of phosphorylation state, and provide guidance for impedance-matching IMAC column capacity with anticipated phosphopeptide content of complex mixtures. Finally, we demonstrate that our improved methodology provides for identification of phosphopeptide distributions that closely mimic physiological conditions. © 2006 American Chemical Society.

33847154642	The phosphothreonine lyase activity of a bacterial type III effector family	Pathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins into host cells to modulate the host signaling pathways. In this study, the Shigella type III effector OspF was shown to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) [extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (Erk1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38]. OspF irreversibly removed phosphate groups from the phosphothreonine but not from the phosphotyrosine residue in the activation loop of MAPKs. Mass spectrometry revealed a mass loss of 98 daltons in p-Erk2, due to the abstraction of the α proton concomitant with cleavage of the C-OP bond in the phosphothreonine residue. This unexpected enzymatic activity, termed phosphothreonine lyase, appeared specific for MAPKs and was shared by other OspF family members.

34248218612	A Pseudomonas syringae Effector Inactivates MAPKs to Suppress PAMP-Induced Immunity in Plants	Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) elicit basal defense responses in plants, and, in turn, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to overcome these PAMP-induced defenses. To suppress immunity, the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae secretes effector proteins, the biochemical function and virulence targets of which remain largely unknown. We show that HopAI1, an effector widely conserved in both plant and animal bacterial pathogens, inhibits the Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activated by exposure to PAMPs. HopAI1 inactivates MAPKs by removing the phosphate group from phosphothreonine through a unique phosphothreonine lyase activity, which is required for HopAI1 function. The inhibition of MAPKs by HopA1 suppresses two independent downstream events, namely the reinforcement of cell wall defense and transcriptional activation of PAMP response genes. The MAPKs MPK3 and MPK6 physically interact with HopAI1 indicating that they are direct targets of HopAI1. These findings uncover a mechanism by which Pseudomonas syringae overcomes host innate immunity to promote pathogenesis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

34548606963	The structural basis for activation of plant immunity by bacterial effector protein AvrPto	Pathogenic microbes use effectors to enhance susceptibility in host plants. However, plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system to detect these effectors using cognate disease resistance proteins, a recognition that is highly specific, often elicits rapid and localized cell death, known as a hypersensitive response, and thus potentially limits pathogen growth. Despite numerous genetic and biochemical studies on the interactions between pathogen effector proteins and plant resistance proteins, the structural bases for such interactions remain elusive. The direct interaction between the tomato protein kinase Pto and the Pseudomonas syringae effector protein AvrPto is known to trigger disease resistance and programmed cell death through the nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) class of disease resistance protein Prf. Here we present the crystal structure of an AvrPto-Pto complex. Contrary to the widely held hypothesis that AvrPto activates Pto kinase activity, our structural and biochemical analyses demonstrated that AvrPto is an inhibitor of Pto kinase in vitro. The AvrPto-Pto interaction is mediated by the phosphorylation-stabilized P+1 loop and a second loop in Pto, both of which negatively regulate the Prf-mediated defences in the absence of AvrPto in tomato plants. Together, our results show that AvrPto derepresses host defences by interacting with the two defence-inhibition loops of Pto. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.

36749011295	Structural Insights into the Enzymatic Mechanism of the Pathogenic MAPK Phosphothreonine Lyase	The OspF family of phosphothreonine lyase, including SpvC from Salmonella, irreversibly inactivates the dual-phosphorylated host MAPKs (pT-X-pY) through β elimination. We determined crystal structures of SpvC and its complex with a phosphopeptide substrate. SpvC adopts a unique fold of α/β type. The disordered N terminus harbors a canonical D motif for MAPK substrate docking. The enzyme-substrate complex structure indicates that recognition of the phosphotyrosine followed by insertion of the threonine phosphate into an arginine pocket places the phosphothreonine into the enzyme active site. This requires the conformational flexibility of pT-X-pY, which suggests that p38 (pT-G-pY) is likely the preferred physiological substrate. Structure-based biochemical and enzymatic analysis allows us to propose a general acid/base mechanism for β elimination reaction catalyzed by the phosphothreonine lyase. The mechanism described here provides a structural understanding of MAPK inactivation by a family of pathogenic effectors conserved in plant and animal systems and may also open a new route for biological catalysis. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

37249082641	Protein kinase A and casein kinases mediate sequential phosphorylation events in the circadian negative feedback loop	Regulation of circadian clock components by phosphorylation plays essential roles in clock functions and is conserved from fungi to mammals. In the Neurospora circadian negative feedback loop, FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein inhibits WHITE COLLAR (WC) complex activity by recruiting the casein kinases CKI and CKII to phosphorylate the WC proteins, resulting in the repression of frq transcription. On the other hand, CKI and CKII progressively phosphorylate FRQ to promote FRQ degradation, a process that is a major determinant of circadian period length. Here, by using whole-cell isotope labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry methods, we show that the WC-1 phosphorylation events critical for the negative feedback process occur sequentially - first by a priming kinase, then by the FRQ-recruited casein kinases. We further show that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) is essential for clock function and inhibits WC activity by serving as a priming kinase for the casein kinases. In addition, PKA also regulates FRQ phosphorylation, but unlike CKI and CKII, PKA stabilizes FRQ, similar to the stabilization of human PERIOD2 (hPER2) due to the phosphorylation at the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (FASPS) site. Thus, PKA is a key clock component that regulates several critical processes in the circadian negative feedback loop. © 2007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.

41349114789	Sorting of Small RNAs into Arabidopsis Argonaute Complexes Is Directed by the 5′ Terminal Nucleotide	Argonaute (AGO) proteins recruit small RNAs to form the core of RNAi effector complexes. Arabidopsis encodes ten AGO proteins and a large network of small RNAs. How these small RNAs are sorted into specific AGO complexes remains largely unknown. We have cataloged small RNAs resident in four AGO complexes. We found that AGO2 and AGO4 preferentially recruit small RNAs with a 5′ terminal adenosine, whereas AGO1 harbors microRNAs (miRNAs) that favor a 5′ terminal uridine. AGO5 predominantly binds small RNAs that initiate with cytosine. Changing the 5′ terminal nucleotide of an miRNA predictably redirected it into a different AGO complex and alters its biological activity. These results reveal a role for small RNA sequences in assorting among AGO complexes. This suggests that specialization of AGO complexes might involve remodeling the 5′ end-binding pocket to accept certain small RNA sequences, perhaps explaining the evolutionary drive for miRNAs to initiate with uridine. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

77954583000	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases integrate signaling from multiple plant immune receptors and are targeted by a Pseudomonas syringae effector	Cell-surface-localized plant immune receptors, such as FLS2, detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) through poorly understood signal-transduction pathways. The pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrPphB, a cysteine protease, cleaves the Arabidopsis receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBS1 to trigger cytoplasmic immune receptor RPS5-specified effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Analyzing the function of AvrPphB in plants lacking RPS5, we find that AvrPphB can inhibit PTI by cleaving additional PBS1-like (PBL) kinases, including BIK1, PBL1, and PBL2. In unstimulated plants, BIK1 and PBL1 interact with FLS2 and are rapidly phosphorylated upon FLS2 activation by its ligand flg22. Genetic and molecular analyses indicate that BIK1, and possibly PBL1, PBL2, and PBS1, integrate immune signaling from multiple immune receptors. Whereas AvrPphB-mediated degradation of one of these kinases, PBS1, is monitored by RPS5to initiate ETI, this pathogenic effector targets other PBL kinases for PTI inhibition. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79952281056	Symmetrical modification within a nucleosome is not required globally for histone lysine methylation	Two copies of each core histone exist in every nucleosome; however, it is not known whether both histones within a nucleosome are required to be symmetrically methylated at the same lysine residues. We report that for most lysine methylation states, wild-type histones paired with mutant, unmethylatable histones in mononucleosomes have comparable methylation levels to bulk histones. Our results indicate that symmetrical histone methylation is not required on a global scale. However, wild-type H4 histones paired with unmethylatable H4K20R histones showed reduced levels of H4K20me2 and H4K20me3, suggesting that some fractions of these modifications might exist symmetrically, and enzymes mediating these modifications might, to some extent, favour nucleosome substrates with premethylated H4K20. © 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization Embo.

84898021821	Anp32e, a higher eukaryotic histone chaperone directs preferential recognition for H2A.Z	H2A.Z is a highly conserved histone variant in all species. The chromatin deposition of H2A.Z is specifically catalyzed by the yeast chromatin remodeling complex SWR1 and its mammalian counterpart SRCAP. However, the mechanism by which H2A.Z is preferentially recognized by non-histone proteins remains elusive. Here we identified Anp32e, a novel higher eukaryote-specific histone chaperone for H2A.Z. Anp32e preferentially associates with H2A.Z-H2B dimers rather than H2A-H2B dimers in vitro and in vivo and dissociates non-nucleosomal aggregates formed by DNA and H2A-H2B. We determined the crystal structure of the Anp32e chaperone domain (186-232) in complex with the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. In this structure, the region containing Anp32e residues 214-224, which is absent in other Anp32 family proteins, specifically interacts with the extended H2A.Z αC helix, which exhibits an unexpected conformational change. Genome-wide profiling of Anp32e revealed a remarkable co-occupancy between Anp32e and H2A.Z. Cells overexpressing Anp32e displayed a strong global H2A.Z loss at the +1 nucleosomes, whereas cells depleted of Anp32e displayed a moderate global H2A.Z increase at the +1 nucleosomes. This suggests that Anp32e may help to resolve the non-nucleosomal H2A.Z aggregates and also facilitate the removal of H2A.Z at the +1 nucleosomes, and the latter may help RNA polymerase II to pass the first nucleosomal barrier. © 2014 IBCB, SIBS, CAS.

84908544668	Direct activation of RIP3/MLKL-dependent necrosis by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) protein ICP6 triggers host antiviral defense	The receptor-interacting kinase-3 (RIP3) and its downstream substrate mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) have emerged as the key cellular components in programmed necrotic cell death. Receptors for the cytokines of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family and Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and 4 are able to activate RIP3 through receptor-interacting kinase-1 and Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing IFN-β, respectively. This form of cell death has been implicated in the host-defense system. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the activation of RIP3 by a variety of pathogens, other than the above-mentioned receptors, are largely unknown. Here, we report that human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection triggers RIP3-dependent necrosis. This process requires MLKL but is independent of TNF receptor, TLR3, cylindromatosis, and host RIP homotypic interaction motif-containing protein DNA-dependent activator of IFN regulatory factor. After HSV-1 infection, the viral ribonucleotide reductase large subunit (ICP6) interacts with RIP3. The formation of the ICP6-RIP3 complex requires the RHIM domains of both proteins. An HSV-1 ICP6 deletion mutant failed to cause effective necrosis of HSV-1-infected cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ICP6, but not RHIM mutant ICP6, directly activated RIP3/MLKL-mediated necrosis. Mice lacking RIP3 exhibited severely impaired control of HSV-1 replication and pathogenesis. Therefore, this study reveals a previously uncharacterized host antipathogen mechanism.

58049192897	Identification of Barkor as a mammalian autophagy-specific factor for Beclin 1 and class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase	Autophagy mediates the cellular response to nutrient deprivation, protein aggregation, and pathogen invasion in human. Dysfunction of autophagy has been implicated in multiple human diseases including cancer. The identification of novel autophagy factors in mammalian cells will provide critical mechanistic insights into how this complicated cellular pathway responds to a broad range of challenges. Here, we report the cloning of an autophagy-specific protein that we called Barkor (Beclin 1-associated autophagy-related key regulator) through direct interaction with Beclin 1 in the human phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III complex. Barkor shares 18% sequence identity and 32% sequence similarity with yeast Atg14. Elimination of Barkor expression by RNA interference compromises starvation- and rapamycin-induced LC3 lipidation and autophagosome formation. Overexpression of Barkor leads to autophagy activation and increased number and enlarged volume of autophagosomes. Tellingly, Barkor is also required for suppression of the autophagy-mediated intracellular survival of Salmonella typhimurium in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, Barkor competes with UV radiation resistance associated gene product (UVRAG) for interaction with Beclin 1, and the complex formation of Barkor and Beclin1 is required for their localizations to autophagosomes. Therefore, we define a regulatory signaling pathway mediated by Barkor that positively controls autophagy through Beclin 1 and represents a potential target for drug development in the treatment of human diseases implicated in autophagic dysfunction. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

65449153592	TRIM21 is essential to sustain IFN regulatory factor 3 activation during antiviral response	Virus infection induces host antiviral responses including induction of type I IFNs. Transcription factor IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) plays an essential role and is tightly regulated in this process. Herein we report that TRIM21 (tripartite motif-containing 21) is significantly induced and interacts with IRF3 upon RNA virus infection. Ectopic expression or knockdown of TRIM21 could respectively enhance or impair IRF3-mediated gene expression. Mechanistically, TRIM21 interferes with the interaction between Pin1 (peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, NIMA-interacting 1) and IRF3, thus preventing IRF3 ubiquitination and degradation. A conserved motif in the B 30.2 domain of TRIM21 is critical for its modulation of IRF3 function, while the RING finger is dispensable. Host antiviral responses are significantly boosted or crippled in the presence or absence of TRIM21. Our results identify TRIM21 as an essential modulator of IRF3 stability and demonstrate that it positively regulates the strength and duration of primary antiviral response, thus further strengthening the notion that the TRIM family is evolutionarily integrated with innate immunity.

66449083078	ULK1·ATG13·FIP200 complex mediates mTOR signaling and is essential for autophagy	Autophagy is a degradative process that recycles long-lived and faulty cellular components. It is linked to many diseases and is required for normal development. ULK1, a mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a key role in the initial stages of autophagy, though the exact molecular mechanism is unknown. Here we report identification of a novel protein complex containing ULK1 and two additional protein factors, FIP200 and ATG13, all of which are essential for starvationinduced autophagy. Both FIP200 andATG13are critical for correct localization of ULK1 to the pre-autophagosome and stability of ULK1 protein. Additionally, we demonstrate by using both cellular experiments and a de novo in vitro reconstituted reaction that FIP200 and ATG13 can enhance ULK1 kinase activity individually but both are required for maximal stimulation. Further, we show that ATG13 and ULK1 are phosphorylated by the mTORpathway in a nutrient starvation-regulated manner, indicating that the ULK1·ATG13·FIP200 complex acts as a node for integrating incoming autophagy signals into autophagosome biogenesis. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

67649771757	Setting the pace of the Neurospora circadian clock by multiple independent FRQ phosphorylation events	Protein phosphorylation plays essential roles in eukaryotic circadian clocks. Like PERIOD in animals, the Neurospora core circadian protein FRQ is progressively phosphorylated and becomes extensively phosphorylated before its degradation. In this study, by using purified FRQ protein from Neurospora, we identified 43 in vivo FRQ phosphorylation sites by mass spectrometry analysis. In addition, we show that CK-1a and CKII are responsible for most FRQ phosphorylation events and identify an additional 33 phosphorylation sites by in vitro kinase assays. Whole-cell metabolic isotope labeling and quantitative MS analyses suggest that circadian oscillation of the FRQ phosphorylation profile is primarily due to progressive phosphorylation at the majority of these newly discovered phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, systematic mutations of the identified FRQ phosphorylation sites led to either long or short period phenotypes. These changes in circadian period are attributed to increases or decreases in FRQ stability, respectively. Together, this comprehensive study of FRQ phosphorylation reveals that regulation of FRQ stability by multiple independent phosphorylation events is a major factor that determines the period length of the clock. A model is proposed to explain how FRQ stability is regulated by multiple phosphorylation events.

67650120109	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L is a subunit of human KMT3a/set2 complex required for H3 Lys-36 trimethylation activity in vivo	The presence of histone H3 lysine 36 methylation (H3K36me) correlates with actively transcribed genes. In yeast, histone H3K36me mediated by KMT3 (also known as Set2) recruits a histone deacetylase complex, Rpd3s, to ensure the fidelity of transcription initiation. We report the purification of human KMT3a (also known as HYPB or hSet2) complex and the identification of a novel, higher eukaryotic specific subunit, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HnRNP-L). Interestingly, although KMT3a has intrinsic activity in vitro, HnRNP-L is essential in vivo. Moreover, KMT3a generates mono-, di-, and trimethylated products in vitro, but RNA interference against KMT3a or HnRNP-L down-regulates exclusively the H3K36me3 mark in vivo. © 2009 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

67651083654	Regulation of Cell Death and Innate Immunity by Two Receptor-like Kinases in Arabidopsis	Upon recognition of bacterial flagellin, the plant receptor FLS2 heterodimerizes with brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase 1 (BAK1) and activates plant defense responses. Because constitutive activation of defense responses is detrimental, plant resistance signaling pathways must be negatively controlled, although the mechanisms involved are unclear. We identified Arabidopsis BIR1 as a BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase. Knocking out BIR1 leads to extensive cell death, activation of constitutive defense responses, and impairment in the activation of MPK4, a negative regulator of plant resistance (R) protein signaling, by flagellin. sobir1-1, a mutant obtained in a screen for suppressors of the bir1-1 phenotype, rescued cell death observed in bir1-1. SOBIR1 encodes another receptor-like kinase whose overexpression activates cell death and defense responses.

70049106584	Two Prp19-like U-box proteins in the MOS4-associated complex play redundant roles in plant innate immunity	Plant Resistance (R) proteins play an integral role in defense against pathogen infection. A unique gain-of-function mutation in the R gene SNC1, snc1, results in constitutive activation of plant immune pathways and enhanced resistance against pathogen infection. We previously found that mutations in MOS4 suppress the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1, and that MOS4 is part of a nuclear complex called the MOS4-Associated Complex (MAC) along with the transcription factor AtCDC5 and the WD-40 protein PRL1. Here we report the immuno-affinity purification of the MAC using HA-tagged MOS4 followed by protein sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. A total of 24 MAC proteins were identified, 19 of which have predicted roles in RNA processing based on their homology to proteins in the Prp19-Complex, an evolutionarily conserved spliceosome-associated complex containing homologs of MOS4, AtCDC5, and PRL1. Among these were two highly similar U-box proteins with homology to the yeast and human E3 ubiquitin ligase Prp19, which we named MAC3A and MAC3B. MAC3B was recently shown to exhibit E3 ligase activity in vitro. Through reverse genetics analysis we show that MAC3A and MAC3B are functionally redundant and are required for basal and R protein-mediated resistance in Arabidopsis. Like mos4-1 and Atcdc5-1, mac3a mac3b suppresses snc1-mediated autoimmunity. MAC3 localizes to the nucleus and interacts with AtCDC5 in planta. Our results suggest that MAC3A and MAC3B are members of the MAC that function redundantly in the regulation of plant innate immunity. © 2009 Monaghan et al.

70349577785	Phosphorylation of the Human MicroRNA-Generating Complex Mediates MAPK/Erk Signaling	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) govern an expanding number of biological and disease processes. Understanding the mechanisms by which the miRNA pathway is regulated, therefore, represents an important area of investigation. We determined that the human miRNA-generating complex is comprised of Dicer and phospho-TRBP isoforms. Phosphorylation of TRBP is mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Erk. Expression of phospho-mimic TRBP and TRBP phosphorylation enhanced miRNA production by increasing stability of the miRNA-generating complex. Mitogenic signaling in response to serum and the tumor promoter PMA was dependent on TRBP phosphorylation. These effects were accompanied by a coordinated increase in levels of growth-promoting miRNA and reduced expression of let-7 tumor suppressor miRNA. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of MAPK/Erk resulted in an anti-growth miRNA profile. Taken together, these studies indicate that the MAPK/Erk pathway regulates the miRNA machinery and suggest a general principle, wherein signaling systems target the miRNA pathway to achieve biological responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

77950462427	Partitioning of histone H3-H4 tetramers during DNA replicationdependent chromatin assembly	Semiconservative DNA replication ensures the faithful duplication of genetic information during cell divisions. However, how epigenetic information carried by historie modifications propagates through mitotic divisions remains elusive. To address this question, the DNA replication-dependent nucleosome partition pattern must be clarified. Here, we report significant amounts of H3.3-H4 tetramers split in vivo, whereas most H3.1-H4 tetramers remained intact. Inhibiting DNA replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced the level of splitting events, which suggests that (i) the replication-independent H3.3 deposition pathway proceeds largely by cooperatively incorporating two new H3.3-H4 dimers and (ii) the majority of splitting events occurred during replication-dependent deposition. Our results support the idea that "silent" histone modifications within Large heterochromatic regions are maintained by copying modifications from neighboring preexisting histones without the need for H3-H4 splitting events.

77955352128	Keap1 facilitates p62-mediated ubiquitin aggregate clearance via autophagy	The accumulation of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that the autophagy lysosomal pathway plays a critical role in the clearance of ubiquitin aggregates, a process that is mediated by the ubiquitin binding protein p62. In addition to binding ubiquitin, p62 also interacts with LC3 and transports ubiquitin conjugates to autophagosomes for degradation. The exact regulatory mechanism of this process is still largely unknown. Here we report the identification of Keap1 as a binding partner for p62 and LC3. Keap1 inhibits Nrf2 by sequestering it in the cytosol and preventing its translocation to the nucleus and activation of genes involved in the oxidative stress response. In this study, we found that Keap1 interacts with p62 and LC3 in a stress-inducible manner, and that Keap1 colocalizes with LC3 and p62 in puromycin-induced ubiquitin aggregates. Moreover, p62 serves as a bridge between Keap1 and ubiquitin aggregates and autophagosomes. Finally, genetic ablation of Keap1 leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin aggregates, increased cytotoxicity of misfolded protein aggregates, and defective activation of autophagy. Therefore, this study assigns a novel positive role of Keap1 in upregulating p62-mediated autophagic clearance of ubiquitin aggregates. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.

77955854952	A pseudomonas syringae ADP-ribosyltransferase inhibits arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases	The successful recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) as a danger signal is crucial for plants to fend off numerous potential pathogenic microbes. The signal is relayed through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades to activate defenses. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas syringae type III effector HopF2 can interact with Arabidopsis thaliana MAP KINASE KINASE5 (MKK5) and likely other MKKs to inhibit MPKs and PAMP-triggered immunity. Inhibition of PAMP-induced MPK phosphorylation was observed when HopF2 was delivered naturally by the bacterial type III secretion system. In addition, HopF2 Arg-71 and Asp-175 residues that are required for the interaction with MKK5 are also necessary for blocking MAP kinase activation, PAMP-triggered defenses, and virulence function in plants. HopF2 can inactivate MKK5 and ADP-ribosylate the C terminus of MKK5 in vitro. Arg-313 of MKK5 is required for ADP-ribosylation by HopF2 and MKK5 function in the plant cell. Together, these results indicate that MKKs are important targets of HopF2. © 2010 American Society of Plant Biologists.

78650885452	The ER UDPase ENTPD5 promotes protein N-glycosylation, the Warburg effect, and proliferation in the PTEN pathway	PI3K and PTEN lipid phosphatase control the level of cellular phosphatidylinositol (3, 4, 5)-trisphosphate, an activator of AKT kinases that promotes cell growth and survival. Mutations activating AKT are commonly observed in human cancers. We report here that ENTPD5, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzyme, is upregulated in cell lines and primary human tumor samples with active AKT. ENTPD5 hydrolyzes UDP to UMP to promote protein N-glycosylation and folding in ER. Knockdown of ENTPD5 in PTEN null cells causes ER stress and loss of growth factor receptors. ENTPD5, together with cytidine monophosphate kinase-1 and adenylate kinase-1, constitute an ATP hydrolysis cycle that converts ATP to AMP, resulting in a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis known as the Warburg effect. The growth of PTEN null cells is inhibited both in vitro and in mouse xenograft tumor models. ENTPD5 is therefore an integral part of the PI3K/PTEN regulatory loop and a potential target for anticancer therapy. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78650936005	The RUN domain of Rubicon is important for hVps34 binding, lipid kinase inhibition, and autophagy suppression	The class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3KC3) plays a central role in autophagy. Rubicon, a RUN domain-containing protein, is newly identified as a PI3KC3 subunit through its association with Beclin 1. Rubicon serves as a negative regulator of PI3KC3 and autophagosome maturation. The molecular mechanism underlying the PI3KC3 and autophagy inhibition by Rubicon is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Rubicon interacts with the PI3KC3 catalytic subunit hVps34 via its RUN domain. The RUN domain contributes to the efficient inhibition of PI3KC3 lipid kinase activity by Rubicon. Furthermore, a Rubicon RUN domain deletion mutant fails to complement the autophagy deficiency in Rubicon-depleted cells. Hence, these results reveal a critical role of the Rubicon RUN domain in PI3KC3 and autophagy regulation. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79953143753	H3K36 methylation antagonizes PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation	H3K27 methylation mediated by the histone methyltransferase complex PRC2 is critical for transcriptional regulation, Polycomb silencing, Drosophila segmentation, mammalian X chromosome inactivation, and cancer. PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation can spread along the chromatin and propagate the repressive chromatin environment; thus, chromatin components that antagonize the activity of PRC2 are important for restraining Polycomb silencing. Here we report that in HeLa cells, H3 histones unmethylated at Lys-36 are mostly methylated at Lys-27, with the exception of newly synthesized H3. In addition, K27me3 rarely co-exists with K36me2 or K36me3 on the same histone H3 polypeptide. Moreover, PRC2 activity is greatly inhibited on nucleosomal substrates with preinstalled H3K36 methylation. These findings collectively identify H3K36 methylation as a chromatin component that restricts the PRC2-mediated spread of H3K27 methylation. Finally, we provide evidence that the controversial histone lysine methyltransferase Ash1, a known Trithorax group protein that antagonizes Polycomb silencing in vivo, is an H3K36-specific dimethylase, not an H3K4 methylase, further supporting the role of H3K36 methylation in antagonizing PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Upon starvation, autophagy is induced, providing cells with needed nutrient supplies. We report here that Unc-51-like kinase 1 (Ulk1), a key initiator for mammalian autophagy, undergoes dramatic dephosphorylation upon starvation, particularly at serine 638 and serine 758. Phosphorylations of Ulk1 are mediated by mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK interacts with Ulk1 in a nutrient-dependent manner. Proper phosphorylations on Ulk1 are crucial for Ulk1/AMPK association, as a single serine-to-alanine mutation (S758A) at Ulk1 impairs this interaction. Compared to the wild-type ULK1, this Ulk1-S758A mutant initiates starvation-induced autophagy faster at an early time point, but does not alter the maximum capacity of autophagy when starvation prolongs. This study therefore revealed previously unnoticed acute autophagy response to environmental changes.

79955379829	RNA helicase p68 (DDX5) regulates tau exon 10 splicing by modulating a stem-loop structure at the 5′ splice site	Regulation of tau exon 10 splicing plays an important role in tauopathy. One of the cis elements regulating tau alternative splicing is a stem-loop structure at the 5′ splice site of tau exon 10. The RNA helicase(s) modulating this stem-loop structure was unknown. We searched for splicing regulators interacting with this stem-loop region using an RNA affinity pulldown-coupled mass spectrometry approach and identified DDX5/RNA helicase p68 as an activator of tau exon 10 splicing. The activity of p68 in stimulating tau exon 10 inclusion is dependent on RBM4, an intronic splicing activator. RNase H cleavage and U1 protection assays suggest that p68 promotes conformational change of the stem-loop structure, thereby increasing the access of U1snRNP to the 5′ splice site of tau exon 10. This study reports the first RNA helicase interacting with a stem-loop structure at the splice site and regulating alternative splicing in a helicase-dependent manner. Our work uncovers a previously unknown function of p68 in regulating tau exon 10 splicing. Furthermore, our experiments reveal functional interaction between two splicing activators for tau exon 10, p68 binding at the stem-loop region and RBM4 interacting with the intronic splicing enhancer region. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

79955458691	RCOR2 is a subunit of the LSD1 complex that regulates ESC property and substitutes for SOX2 in reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency	Histone demethylase LSD1 can form complex with different rcor family corepressors in different cell types. It remains unknown if cell-specific Rcor proteins function specifically in distinct cell types. Here, we report that Rcor2 is predominantly expressed in ESCs and forms a complex with LsD1 and facilitates its nucleosomal demethylation activity. Knockdown of Rcor2 in ESCs inhibited Esc proliferation and severely impaired the pluripotency.Moreover, knockdown of Rcor2 greatly impaired the formation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. In contrast, ectopic expression of Rcor2 in somatic cells together with Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 promoted the formation of iPS cells. Most interestingly, ectopic expression of Rcor2 in both mouse and human somatic cells effectively substituted the requirement for exogenous Sox2 expression in somatic cell reprogramming. © AlphaMed Press.

79958825213	Structure of C3PO and mechanism of human RISC activation	Assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) consists of loading duplex (guide-passenger) siRNA onto Argonaute (Ago2) and removing the passenger strand. Ago2 contributes critically to RISC activation by nicking the passenger strand. Here we reconstituted duplex siRNA-initiated RISC activity using recombinant human Ago2 (hAgo2) and C3PO, indicating that C3PO has a critical role in hAgo2-RISC activation. Consistently, genetic depletion of C3PO compromised RNA silencing in mammalian cells. We determined the crystal structure of hC3PO, which reveals an asymmetric octamer barrel consisting of six translin and two TRAX subunits. This asymmetric assembly is critical for the function of C3PO as an endonuclease that cleaves RNA at the interior surface. The current work supports a Dicer-independent mechanism for human RISC activation, in which Ago2 directly binds duplex siRNA and nicks the passenger strand, and then C3PO activates RISC by degrading the Ago2-nicked passenger strand. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

79961199215	Phosphorylation of SOS3-like calcium-binding proteins by their interacting SOS2-like protein kinases is a common regulatory mechanism in Arabidopsis	The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome encodes nine Salt Overly Sensitive3 (SOS3)-like calcium-binding proteins (SCaBPs; also named calcineurin B-like protein [CBL]) and 24 SOS2-like protein kinases (PKSs; also named as CBL-interacting protein kinases [CIPKs]). A general regulatory mechanism between these two families is that SCaBP calcium sensors activate PKS kinases by interacting with their FISL motif. In this study, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of SCaBPs by their functional interacting PKSs is another common regulatory mechanism. The phosphorylation site serine-216 at the C terminus of SCaBP1 by PKS24 was identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry analysis. This serine residue is conserved within the PFPF motif at the C terminus of SCaBP proteins. Phosphorylation of this site of SCaBP8 by SOS2 has been determined previously. We further showed that CIPK23/PKS17 phosphorylated CBL1/SCaBP5 and CBL9/SCaBP7 and PKS5 phosphorylated SCaBP1 at the same site in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the phosphorylation stabilized the interaction between SCaBP and PKS proteins. This tight interaction neutralized the inhibitory effect of PKS5 on plasma membrane H+-ATPase activity. These data indicate that SCaBP phosphorylation by their interacting PKS kinases is a critical component of the SCaBP-PKS regulatory pathway in Arabidopsis. © 2011 American Society of Plant Biologists.

80055075492	Clonal production and organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex	The neocortex contains excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Clones of neocortical excitatory neurons originating from the same progenitor cell are spatially organized and contribute to the formation of functional microcircuits. In contrast, relatively little is known about the production and organization of neocortical inhibitory interneurons. We found that neocortical inhibitory interneurons were produced as spatially organized clonal units in the developing ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, clonally related interneurons did not randomly disperse but formed spatially isolated clusters in the neocortex. Individual clonal clusters consisting of interneurons expressing the same or distinct neurochemical markers exhibited clear vertical or horizontal organization. These results suggest that the lineage relationship plays a pivotal role in the organization of inhibitory interneurons in the neocortex.

80555135907	Autoantigen la promotes efficient RNAi, antiviral response, and transposon silencing by facilitating multiple-turnover RISC catalysis	The effector of RNA interference (RNAi) is the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). C3PO promotes the activation of RISC by degrading the Argonaute2 (Ago2)-nicked passenger strand of duplex siRNA. Active RISC is a multiple-turnover enzyme that uses the guide strand of siRNA to direct the Ago2-mediated sequence-specific cleavage of complementary mRNA. How this effector step of RNAi is regulated is currently unknown. Here, we used the human Ago2 minimal RISC system to purify Sjögren's syndrome antigen B (SSB)/autoantigen La as an activator of the RISC-mediated mRNA cleavage activity. Our reconstitution studies showed that La could promote multiple-turnover RISC catalysis by facilitating the release of cleaved mRNA from RISC. Moreover, we demonstrated that La was required for efficient RNAi, antiviral defense, and transposon silencing in vivo. Taken together, the findings of C3PO and La reveal a general concept that regulatory factors are required to remove Ago2-cleaved products to assemble or restore active RISC. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

83755170862	Site-specific incorporation of photo-cross-linker and bioorthogonal amino acids into enteric bacterial pathogens	Enteric bacterial pathogens are known to effectively pass through the extremely acidic mammalian stomachs and cause infections in the small and/or large intestine of human hosts. However, their acid-survival strategy and pathogenesis mechanisms remain elusive, largely due to the lack of tools to directly monitor and manipulate essential components (e.g., defense proteins or invasive toxins) participating in these processes. Herein, we have extended the pyrrolysine-based genetic code expansion strategy for encoding unnatural amino acids in enteric bacterial species, including enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, and Salmonella. Using this system, a photo-cross-linking amino acid was incorporated into a Shigella acid chaperone HdeA (shHdeA), which allowed the identification of a comprehensive list of in vivo client proteins that are protected by shHdeA upon acid stress. To further demonstrate the application of our strategy, an azide-bearing amino acid was introduced into a Shigella type 3 secretion effector, OspF, without interruption of its secretion efficiency. This site-specifically installed azide handle allowed the facile detection of OspF's secretion in bacterial extracellular space. Taken together, these bioorthogonal functionalities we incorporated into enteric pathogens were shown to facilitate the investigation of unique and important proteins involved in the pathogenesis and stress-defense mechanisms of pathogenic bacteria that remain exceedingly difficult to study using conventional methodologies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

84655170009	A model for mitotic inheritance of histone lysine methylation	Histone lysine methylation has been implicated in epigenetic regulation of transcription. Using stable-isotope labelling and quantitative mass spectrometry, we analysed the dynamics of histone lysine methylation. Here we report that histone methylation levels are transiently reduced during S phase and are gradually re-established during subsequent cell cycle stages. However, despite the recovery of overall methylation levels before the next S phase, the methylation levels of parental and newly incorporated histones differ significantly. In addition, histone methylation levels are maintained at steady states by both restriction of methyltransferase activity and the active turnover of methyl groups in cells undergoing an extended G1/S phase arrest. Finally, we propose a 'buffer model' that unifies the imprecise inheritance of histone methylation and the faithful maintenance of underlying gene silencing. © 2012 EUROPEAN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY ORGANIZATION.

84855764312	Cysteine methylation disrupts ubiquitin-chain sensing in NF-κB activation	NF-κB is crucial for innate immune defence against microbial infection. Inhibition of NF-κB signalling has been observed with various bacterial infections. The NF-κB pathway critically requires multiple ubiquitin-chain signals of different natures. The question of whether ubiquitin-chain signalling and its specificity in NF-κB activation are regulated during infection, and how this regulation takes place, has not been explored. Here we show that human TAB2 and TAB3, ubiquitin-chain sensory proteins involved in NF-κB signalling, are directly inactivated by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli NleE, a conserved bacterial type-III-secreted effector responsible for blocking host NF-κB signalling. NleE harboured an unprecedented S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase activity that specifically modified a zinc-coordinating cysteine in the Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domains in TAB2 and TAB3. Cysteine-methylated TAB2-NZF and TAB3-NZF (truncated proteins only comprising the NZF domain) lost the zinc ion as well as the ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Ectopically expressed or type-III-secretion-system-delivered NleE methylated TAB2 and TAB3 in host cells and diminished their ubiquitin-chain binding activity. Replacement of the NZF domain of TAB3 with the NleE methylation-insensitive Npl4 NZF domain resulted in NleE-resistant NF-κB activation. Given the prevalence of zinc-finger motifs and activation of cysteine thiol by zinc binding, methylation of zinc-finger cysteine might regulate other eukaryotic pathways in addition to NF-κB signalling. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84860541901	A Xanthomonas uridine 5′-monophosphate transferase inhibits plant immune kinases	Plant innate immunity is activated on the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at the cell surface, or of pathogen effector proteins inside the plant cell. Together, PAMP-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity constitute powerful defences against various phytopathogens. Pathogenic bacteria inject a variety of effector proteins into the host cell to assist infection or propagation. A number of effector proteins have been shown to inhibit plant immunity, but the biochemical basis remains unknown for the vast majority of these effectors. Here we show that the Xanthomonas campestris pathovar campestris type III effector AvrAC enhances virulence and inhibits plant immunity by specifically targeting Arabidopsis BIK1 and RIPK, two receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases known to mediate immune signalling. AvrAC is a uridylyl transferase that adds uridine 5′-monophosphate to and conceals conserved phosphorylation sites in the activation loop of BIK1 and RIPK, reducing their kinase activity and consequently inhibiting downstream signalling. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84860555278	A companion cell-dominant and developmentally regulated H3K4 demethylase controls flowering time in Arabidopsis via the repression of FLC expression	Flowering time relies on the integration of intrinsic developmental cues and environmental signals. FLC and its downstream target FT are key players in the floral transition in Arabidopsis. Here, we characterized the expression pattern and function of JMJ18, a novel JmjC domain-containing histone H3K4 demethylase gene in Arabidopsis. JMJ18 was dominantly expressed in companion cells; its temporal expression pattern was negatively and positively correlated with that of FLC and FT, respectively, during vegetative development. Mutations in JMJ18 resulted in a weak late-flowering phenotype, while JMJ18 overexpressors exhibited an obvious early-flowering phenotype. JMJ18 displayed demethylase activity toward H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, and bound FLC chromatin directly. The levels of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 in chromatins of FLC clade genes and the expression of FLC clade genes were reduced, whereas FT expression was induced and the protein expression of FT increased in JMJ18 overexpressor lines. The early-flowering phenotype caused by the overexpression of JMJ18 was mainly dependent on the functional FT. Our findings suggest that the companion cell-dominant and developmentally regulated JMJ18 binds directly to the FLC locus, reducing the level of H3K4 methylation in FLC chromatin and repressing the expression of FLC, thereby promoting the expression of FT in companion cells to stimulate flowering. © 2012 Yang et al.

84860872161	Cell-free formation of RNA granules: Low complexity sequence domains form dynamic fibers within hydrogels	Eukaryotic cells contain assemblies of RNAs and proteins termed RNA granules. Many proteins within these bodies contain KH or RRM RNA-binding domains as well as low complexity (LC) sequences of unknown function. We discovered that exposure of cell or tissue lysates to a biotinylated isoxazole (b-isox) chemical precipitated hundreds of RNA-binding proteins with significant overlap to the constituents of RNA granules. The LC sequences within these proteins are both necessary and sufficient for b-isox-mediated aggregation, and these domains can undergo a concentration-dependent phase transition to a hydrogel-like state in the absence of the chemical. X-ray diffraction and EM studies revealed the hydrogels to be composed of uniformly polymerized amyloid-like fibers. Unlike pathogenic fibers, the LC sequence-based polymers described here are dynamic and accommodate heterotypic polymerization. These observations offer a framework for understanding the function of LC sequences as well as an organizing principle for cellular structures that are not membrane bound.

84861954572	Preferential electrical coupling regulates neocortical lineage-dependent microcircuit assembly	Radial glial cells are the primary neural progenitor cells in the developing neocortex. Consecutive asymmetric divisions of individual radial glial progenitor cells produce a number of sister excitatory neurons that migrate along the elongated radial glial fibre, resulting in the formation of ontogenetic columns. Moreover, sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns preferentially develop specific chemical synapses with each other rather than with nearby non-siblings. Although these findings provide crucial insight into the emergence of functional columns in the neocortex, little is known about the basis of this lineage-dependent assembly of excitatory neuron microcircuits at single-cell resolution. Here we show that transient electrical coupling between radially aligned sister excitatory neurons regulates the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses in the neocortex. Multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings showed that sister excitatory neurons preferentially form strong electrical coupling with each other rather than with adjacent non-sister excitatory neurons during early postnatal stages. This preferential coupling allows selective electrical communication between sister excitatory neurons, promoting their action potential generation and synchronous firing. Interestingly, although this electrical communication largely disappears before the appearance of chemical synapses, blockade of the electrical communication impairs the subsequent formation of specific chemical synapses between sister excitatory neurons in ontogenetic columns. These results suggest a strong link between lineage-dependent transient electrical coupling and the assembly of precise excitatory neuron microcircuits in the neocortex. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84862777210	A Mammalian Autophagosome Maturation Mechanism Mediated by TECPR1 and the Atg12-Atg5 Conjugate	Autophagy is a major catabolic pathway in eukaryotes associated with a broad spectrum of human diseases. In autophagy, autophagosomes carrying cellular cargoes fuse with lysosomes for degradation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying autophagosome maturation is largely unknown. Here we report that TECPR1 binds to the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P) to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion. TECPR1 and Atg16 form mutually exclusive complexes with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate, and TECPR1 binds PtdIns(3)P upon association with the Atg12-Atg5 conjugate. Strikingly, TECPR1 localizes to and recruits Atg5 to autolysosome membrane. Consequently, elimination of TECPR1 leads to accumulation of autophagosomes and blocks autophagic degradation of LC3-II and p62. Finally, autophagosome maturation marked by GFP-mRFP-LC3 is defective in TECPR1-deficient cells. Thus, we propose that the concerted interactions among TECPR1, Atg12-Atg5, and PtdIns(3)P provide the fusion specificity between autophagosomes and lysosomes and that the assembly of this complex initiates the autophagosome maturation process. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862907788	Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein mediates necrosis signaling downstream of RIP3 kinase	The receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinase 3 (RIP3) is a key signaling molecule in the programmed necrosis (necroptosis) pathway. This pathway plays important roles in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions, including development, tissue damage response, and antiviral immunity. Here, we report the identification of a small molecule called (E)-N-(4-(N-(3-methoxypyrazin-2-yl)sulfamoyl)phenyl)-3-(5-nitrothiophene-2-yl) acrylamide - hereafter referred to as necrosulfonamide - that specifically blocks necrosis downstream of RIP3 activation. An affinity probe derived from necrosulfonamide and coimmunoprecipitation using anti-RIP3 antibodies both identified the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) as the interacting target. MLKL was phosphorylated by RIP3 at the threonine 357 and serine 358 residues, and these phosphorylation events were critical for necrosis. Treating cells with necrosulfonamide or knocking down MLKL expression arrested necrosis at a specific step at which RIP3 formed discrete punctae in cells. These findings implicate MLKL as a key mediator of necrosis signaling downstream of the kinase RIP3. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84862909353	The mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5 functions at the convergence point of multiple necrotic death pathways	The programmed necrosis induced by TNF-α requires the activities of the receptor-interacting serine-threonine kinases RIP1 and RIP3 and their interaction with the mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein MLKL. We report the identification of RIP1- and RIP3-containing protein complexes that form specifically in response to necrosis induction. One component of these complexes is the mitochondrial protein phosphatase PGAM5, which presents as two splice variants, PGAM5L (long form) and PGAM5S (short form). Knockdown of either form attenuated necrosis induced by TNF-α as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ionophore, whereas knockdown of RIP3 and MLKL blocked only TNF-α-mediated necrosis. Upon necrosis induction, PGAM5S recruited the mitochondrial fission factor Drp1 and activated its GTPase activity by dephosphorylating the serine 637 site of Drp1. Drp1 activation caused mitochondrial fragmentation, an early and obligatory step for necrosis execution. These data defined PGAM5 as the convergent point for multiple necrosis pathways. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84863101666	The MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 kinase cascade negatively regulates immunity mediated by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase in Arabidopsis	In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade represses cell death and immune responses. In mekk1, mkk1 mkk2, and mpk4 mutants, programmed cell death and defense responses are constitutively activated, but the mechanism by which MEKK1, MKK1/MKK2, and MPK4 negatively regulate cell death and immunity was unknown. From a screen for suppressors of mkk1 mkk2, we found that mutations in suppressor of mkk1 mkk2 1 (summ1) suppress the cell death and defense responses not only in mkk1 mkk2 but also in mekk1 and mpk4. SUMM1 encodes the MAP kinase kinase kinase MEKK2. It interacts with MPK4 and is phosphorylated by MPK4 in vitro. Overexpression of SUMM1 activates cell death and defense responses that are dependent on the nucleotide binding- leucine-rich repeat protein SUMM2. Taken together, our data suggest that the MEKK1-MKK1/MKK2-MPK4 kinase cascade negatively regulates MEKK2 and activation of MEKK2 triggers SUMM2-mediated immune responses. © 2012 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84863692940	IDN2 and its paralogs form a complex required for RNA-directed DNA methylation	IDN2/RDM12 has been previously identified as a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana, but how it functions in RdDM remains unknown. By affinity purification of IDN2, we co-purified two IDN2 paralogs IDP1 and IDP2 (IDN2 PARALOG 1 and 2). The coiled-coil domain between the XS and XH domains of IDN2 is essential for IDN2 homodimerization, whereas the IDN2 C-terminal XH domain but not the coiled-coil domain is required for IDN2 interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. By introducing the wild-type IDN2 sequence and its mutated derivatives into the idn2 mutant for complementation testing, we demonstrated that the previously uncharacterized IDN2 XH domain is required for the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex formation as well as for IDN2 function. IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, whereas IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting that the roles of IDP1 and IDP2 are different from those of IDN2 in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex and that IDP1 and IDP2 are essential for the functioning of the complex in RdDM. © 2012 Zhang et al.

84865319466	Investigating the cell cycle-associated dynamics of histone modifications using quantitative mass spectrometry	In eukaryotic cells, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on histones regulate chromatin structure and thus impact nearly all chromatin-templated events, including replication, transcription, and DNA repair. During S phase, newly synthesized histones are deposited onto DNA, leading to dilution of total chromatin-associated modifications. To maintain genome organization in daughter cells, histone PTMs must be reestablished in the subsequent cell cycle. Owing to their importance for determining cellular fate, the mechanisms that underlie the inheritance of epigenetic mark from parent cells by daughter cells are of great interest. In recent years, mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying histone modifications. This chapter describes strategies for investigating the reestablishment of histone PTMs during the mitotic cell cycle using quantitative MS approaches. By introducing these basic principles of experimental design and common protocols, we hope that this chapter will help readers to apply quantitative MS in their own research systems to study the biology of histone modifications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

84867653552	Protein kinase WNK3 regulates the neuronal splicing factor Fox-1	We report an action of the protein kinase WNK3 on the neuronal mRNA splicing factor Fox-1. Fox-1 splices mRNAs encoding proteins important in synaptic transmission and membrane excitation. WNK3, implicated in the control of neuronal excitability through actions on ion transport, binds Fox-1 and inhibits its splicing activity in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of Fox-1 by WNK3 does not change its RNA binding capacity; instead, WNK3 increases the cytoplasmic localization of Fox-1, thereby suppressing Fox-1-dependent splicing. These findings demonstrate a role of WNK3 in RNA processing. Considering the implication of WNK3 and Fox-1 in disorders of neuronal development such as autism, WNK3 may offer a target for treatment of Fox-1-induced disease.

84872377163	Regulation of Microtubule Stability and Organization by Mammalian Par3 in Specifying Neuronal Polarity	Polarization of mammalian neurons with a specified axon requires precise regulation of microtubule and actin dynamics in the developing neurites. Here we show that mammalian partition defective 3 (mPar3), a key component of the Par polarity complex that regulates the polarization of many cell types including neurons, directly regulates microtubule stability and organization. The N-terminal portion of mPar3 exhibits strong microtubule binding, bundling, and stabilization activity, which can be suppressed by its C-terminal portion via an intramolecular interaction. Interestingly, the intermolecular oligomerization of mPar3 is able to relieve the intramolecular interaction and thereby promote microtubule bundling and stabilization. Furthermore, disruption of this microtubule regulatory activity of mPar3 impairs its function in axon specification. Together, these results demonstrate a role for mPar3 in directly regulating microtubule organization that is crucial for neuronal polarization.

84872677190	Small-molecule activation of the TRAIL receptor DR5 in human cancer cells	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) activates apoptosis through the death receptors DR4 and DR5. Because of its superior safety profile and high tumor specificity compared to other TNF family members, recombinant soluble TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against its receptors are actively being developed for clinical cancer therapy. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of the small molecules that directly target DR5 to initiate apoptosis in human cancer cells. The activity was initially discovered through a high-throughput chemical screen for compounds that promote cell death in synergy with a small-molecule mimetic of Smac, the antagonist for inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Structure-activity relationship studies yielded a more potent analog called bioymifi, which can act as a single agent to induce DR5 clustering and aggregation, leading to apoptosis. Thus, this study identified potential lead compounds for the development of small-molecule TRAIL mimics targeting DR5 for cancer therapy. © 2013 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

84874413414	Characterization and proteomic analysis of ovarian cancer-derived exosomes	Ovarian cancer is the most lethal type of cancer among all frequent gynecologic malignancies, because most patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis. Exosomes are important intercellular communication vehicles, released by various cell types. Here we presented firstly the protein profile of highly purified exosomes derived from two ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR-3 and IGROV1. The exosomes derived from ovarian cancer cell lines were round and mostly 30-100. nm in diameter when viewed under an electron microscope. The exosomal marker proteins TSG101 and Alix were detected in exosome preparations. The range of density was between 1.09. g/ml and 1.15. g/ml. A total of 2230 proteins were identified from two ovarian cell-derived exosomes. Among them, 1017 proteins were identified in both exosomes including all of the major exosomal protein markers. There were 380 proteins that are not reported in the ExoCarta database. In addition to common proteins from exosomes of various origins, our results showed that ovarian cancer-derived exosomes also carried tissue specific proteins associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis, especially in ovarian carcinoma. Based on the known roles of exosomes in cellular communication, these data indicate that exosomes released by ovarian cancer cells may play important roles in ovarian cancer progression and provide a potential source of blood-based protein biomarkers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

84874683740	Non-optimal codon usage affects expression, structure and function of clock protein FRQ	Codon-usage bias has been observed in almost all genomes and is thought to result from selection for efficient and accurate translation of highly expressed genes. Codon usage is also implicated in the control of transcription, splicing and RNA structure. Many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias, which is thought to reflect a lack of selection for messenger RNA translation. Alternatively, however, non-optimal codon usage may be of biological importance. The rhythmic expression and the proper function of the Neurospora FREQUENCY (FRQ) protein are essential for circadian clock function. Here we show that, unlike most genes in Neurospora, frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across its entire open reading frame. Optimization of frq codon usage abolishes both overt and molecular circadian rhythms. Codon optimization not only increases FRQ levels but, unexpectedly, also results in conformational changes in FRQ protein, altered FRQ phosphorylation profile and stability, and impaired functions in the circadian feedback loops. These results indicate that non-optimal codon usage of frq is essential for its circadian clock function. Our study provides an example of how non-optimal codon usage functions to regulate protein expression and to achieve optimal protein structure and function. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84876059178	BIK1 interacts with PEPRs to mediate ethylene-induced immunity	Plants have evolved intricate immune mechanisms to combat pathogen infection. Upon perception of pathogen-derived signals, plants accumulate defense hormones such as ethylene (ET), jasmonate, salicylate, and damage-associated molecular patterns to amplify immune responses. In particular, the Arabidopsis peptide Pep1 and its family members are thought to be damage-associated molecular patterns that trigger immunity through Pep1 receptor kinases PEPR1 and PEPR2. Here we show that PEPR1 specifically interacts with receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases botrytis-induced kinase 1 (BIK1) and PBS1-like 1 (PBL1) to mediate Pep1-induced defenses. In vitro and in vivo studies suggested that PEPR1, and likely PEPR2, directly phosphorylates BIK1 in response to Pep1 treatment. Surprisingly, the pepr1/pepr2 double-mutant seedlings displayed reduced in sensitivity to ET, as indicated by the elongated hypocotyls. ET-induced expression of defense genes and resistance to Botrytis cinerea were compromised in pepr1/pepr2 and bik1 mutants, reenforcing an important role of PEPRs and BIK1 in ET-mediated defense signaling. Pep treatment partially mimicked ET-induced seedling growth inhibition in a PEPR- and BIK1-dependent manner. Furthermore, both ET and Pep1 treatments induced BIK1 phosphorylation in a PEPR-dependent manner. However, the Pep1-induced BIK1 phosphorylation, seedling growth inhibition, and defense gene expression were independent of canonical ET signaling components. Together our results illustrate a mechanism by which ET and PEPR signaling pathways act in concert to amplify immune responses.

84879728657	Regulation of transcription of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-encoding genes SNC1 and RPP4 via H3K4 trimethylation	Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins serve as intracellular sensors to detect pathogen effectors and trigger immune responses. Transcription of the NB-LRR-encoding Resistance (R) genes needs to be tightly controlled to avoid inappropriate defense activation. How the expression of the NB-LRR R genes is regulated is poorly understood. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1 (snc1) mutant carries a gain-of-function mutation in a Toll/Interleukin1 receptor-like (TIR)-NB-LRR-encoding gene, resulting in the constitutive activation of plant defense responses. A snc1 suppressor screen identified modifier of snc1,9 (mos9), which partially suppresses the autoimmune phenotypes of snc1. Positional cloning revealed that MOS9 encodes a plant-specific protein of unknown function. Expression analysis showed that MOS9 is required for the full expression of TIR-NB-LRR protein-encoding RECOGNITION OF PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 4 (RPP4) and SNC1, both of which reside in the RPP4 cluster. Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that MOS9 associates with the Set1 class lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4) methyltransferase Arabidopsis Trithorax-Related7 (ATXR7). Like MOS9, ATXR7 is also required for the full expression of SNC1 and the autoimmune phenotypes in the snc1 mutant. In atxr7 mutant plants, the expression of RPP4 is similarly reduced, and resistance against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis Emwa1 is compromised. Consistent with the attenuated expression of SNC1 and RPP4, trimethylated H3K4marks are reduced around the promoters of SNC1 and RPP4 in mos9 plants. Our data suggest that MOS9 functions together with ATXR7 to regulate the expression of SNC1 and RPP4 through H3K4 methylation, which plays an important role in fine-tuning their transcription levels and functions in plant defense. © 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84884140839	Pathogen blocks host death receptor signalling by arginine GlcNAcylation of death domains	The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) family is crucial for immune homeostasis, cell death and inflammation. These cytokines are recognized by members of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family of death receptors, including TNFR1 and TNFR2, and FAS and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. Death receptor signalling requires death-domain-mediated homotypic/heterotypic interactions between the receptor and its downstream adaptors, including TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD). Here we discover that death domains in several proteins, including TRADD, FADD, RIPK1 and TNFR1, were directly inactivated by NleB, an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) type III secretion system effector known to inhibit host nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling. NleB contained an unprecedented N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase activity that specifically modified a conserved arginine in these death domains (Arg 235 in the TRADD death domain). NleB GlcNAcylation (the addition of GlcNAc onto a protein side chain) of death domains blocked homotypic/heterotypic death domain interactions and assembly of the oligomeric TNFR1 complex, thereby disrupting TNF signalling in EPEC-infected cells, including NF-κB signalling, apoptosis and necroptosis. Type-III-delivered NleB also blocked FAS ligand and TRAIL-induced cell death by preventing formation of a FADD-mediated death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The arginine GlcNAc transferase activity of NleB was required for bacterial colonization in the mouse model of EPEC infection. The mechanism of action of NleB represents a new model by which bacteria counteract host defences, and also a previously unappreciated post-translational modification. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

84884991830	Absolute quantification of a steroid hormone that regulates development in caenorhabditis elegans	Under favorable conditions, Caenorhabditis elegans larvae grow into reproductive adults after a series of molting cycles. When environmental conditions are harsh, they arrest as dauer larvae. Dafachronic acid (DA), a C. elegans steroid hormone, is required for reproductive development. Here, we report a mass spectrometry (MS) method for absolute quantitation of DA in C. elegans. The extraction of DA from C. elegans was optimized to achieve a recovery rate of greater than 83%. The MS sensitivity to DA increased 100-fold after carboxyl group derivatization with 2-picolylamine. High-resolution selected ion monitoring (HR-SIM) on a Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometer Q Exactive outperformed targeted-MS2 on the same instrument and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer TSQ Quantum Discovery. With a limit of quantification as low as 1 pg of DA, the HR-SIM method enables absolute quantification of endogenous DA during the reproductive development of C. elegans. We found that in wild-type (WT) worms, DA increases from 0.04 ± 0.02 ng/mg protein in the L1 larval stage to 1.21 ± 0.67 ng/mg protein in the L2 larval stage and decreases again after the L3 stage. In comparison, four genetic mutants that have a constitutive dauer-formation phenotype due to disrupted insulin, TGF-β, or cGMP signaling all have a very low DA level in the L2 stage (below 15% of the WT). These mutants are able to escape the dauer fate and most of them grow into fertile adults when supplied with exogenous DA. Therefore, a DA spike in the L2 stage is critical for the reproductive development of C. elegans. © 2013 American Chemical Society.

84885638436	Autophagy promotes primary ciliogenesis by removing OFD1 from centriolar satellites	The primary cilium is a microtubule-based organelle that functions in sensory and signalling pathways. Defects in ciliogenesis can lead to a group of genetic syndromes known as ciliopathies. However, the regulatory mechanisms of primary ciliogenesis in normal and cancer cells are incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that autophagic degradation of a ciliopathy protein, OFD1 (oral-facial-digital syndrome 1), at centriolar satellites promotes primary cilium biogenesis. Autophagy is a catabolic pathway in which cytosol, damaged organelles and protein aggregates are engulfed in autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for destruction. We show that the population of OFD1 at the centriolar satellites is rapidly degraded by autophagy upon serum starvation. In autophagy-deficient Atg5 or Atg3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, OFD1 accumulates at centriolar satellites, leading to fewer and shorter primary cilia and a defective recruitment of BBS4 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome 4) to cilia. These defects are fully rescued by OFD1 partial knockdown that reduces the population of OFD1 at centriolar satellites. More strikingly, OFD1 depletion at centriolar satellites promotes cilia formation in both cycling cells and transformed breast cancer MCF7 cells that normally do not form cilia. This work reveals that removal of OFD1 by autophagy at centriolar satellites represents a general mechanism to promote ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. These findings define a newly recognized role of autophagy in organelle biogenesis. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

84885379356	The N-terminal region of the NeurosporaNDR kinase COT1 regulates morphology via its interactions with MOB2A/B	Summary: Nuclear Dbf2p-related (NDR) protein kinases are important for cell differentiation and polar morphogenesis in various organisms, yet some of their functions are still elusive. Dysfunction of the Neurospora crassaNDR kinase COT1 leads to cessation of tip extension and hyperbranching. NDR kinases require the physical interaction between the kinase's N-terminal region (NTR) and the MPS1-binding (MOB) proteins for their activity and functions. To study the interactions between COT1 and MOB2 proteins, we mutated several conserved residues and a novel phosphorylation site within the COT1 NTR. The phenotypes of these mutants suggest that the NTR is required for COT1 functions in regulating hyphal elongation and branching, asexual conidiation and germination. Interestingly, while both MOB2A and MOB2B promote proper hyphal growth, they have distinct COT1-dependent roles in regulation of macroconidiation. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate physical association of COT1 with both MOB2A and MOB2B, simultaneously. Furthermore, the binding of the two MOB2 proteins to COT1 is mediated by different residues at the COT1 NTR, suggesting a hetero-trimer is formed. Thus, although MOB2A/B may have some overlapping functions in regulating hyphal tip extension, their function is not redundant and they are both required for proper fungal development. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

84886672166	Histone H2A ubiquitination inhibits the enzymatic activity of H3 lysine 36 methyltransferases	Histone H3 lysine 27 (H3k27) methylation and H2A monoubiquitination (ubH2A) are two closely related histone modifications that regulate Polycomb silencing. Previous studies reported that H3k27 trimethylation (H3k27me3) rarely coexists with H3k36 di- or tri-methylation (H3k36me2/3) on the same histone H3 tails, which is partially controlled by the direct inhibition of the enzymatic activity of H3k27-specific methyltransferase PRC2. By contrast, H3k27 methylation does not affect the catalytic activity of H3k36-specific methyltransferases, suggesting other Polycomb mechanism(s) may negatively regulate the H3k36-specific methyltransferase(s). In this study, we established a simple protocol to purify milligram quantities of ubH2A from mammalian cells, which were used to reconstitute nucleosome substrates with fully ubiquitinated H2A. A number of histone methyltransferases were then tested on these nucleosome substrates. Notably, all of the H3k36-specific methyltransferases, including ASH1L, HYPB, NSD1, and NSD2 were inhibited by ubH2A, whereas the other histone methyltransferases, including PRC2, G9a, and Pr-Set7 were not affected by ubH2A. Together with previous reports, these findings collectively explain the mutual repulsion of H3k36me2/3 and Polycomb modifications. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84893801023	The SET Domain Proteins SUVH2 and SUVH9 Are Required for Pol V Occupancy at RNA-Directed DNA Methylation Loci	RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons and other DNA repeats in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although previous research has demonstrated that the SET domain-containing SU(VAR)3-9 homologs SUVH2 and SUVH9 are involved in the RdDM pathway, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Our results indicated that SUVH2 and/or SUVH9 not only interact with the chromatin-remodeling complex termed DDR (<underline>D</underline>MS3, <underline>D</underline>RD1, and <underline>R</underline>DM1) but also with the newly characterized complex composed of two conserved Microrchidia (MORC) family proteins, MORC1 and MORC6. The effect of suvh2suvh9 on Pol IV-dependent siRNA accumulation and DNA methylation is comparable to that of the Pol V mutant nrpe1 and the DDR complex mutant dms3, suggesting that SUVH2 and SUVH9 are functionally associated with RdDM. Our CHIP assay demonstrated that SUVH2 and SUVH9 are required for the occupancy of Pol V at RdDM loci and facilitate the production of Pol V-dependent noncoding RNAs. Moreover, SUVH2 and SUVH9 are also involved in the occupancy of DMS3 at RdDM loci. The putative catalytic active site in the SET domain of SUVH2 is dispensable for the function of SUVH2 in RdDM and H3K9 dimethylation. We propose that SUVH2 and SUVH9 bind to methylated DNA and facilitate the recruitment of Pol V to RdDM loci by associating with the DDR complex and the MORC complex. © 2014 Liu et al.

84896079926	The FLS2-associated kinase BIK1 directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD to control plant immunity	The Arabidopsis immune receptor FLS2 senses the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate transient elevation of cytosolic calcium ions, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other signaling events to coordinate antimicrobial defenses, such as stomatal closure that limits bacterial invasion. However, how FLS2 regulates these signaling events remains largely unknown. Here we show that the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase BIK1, a component of the FLS2 immune receptor complex, not only positively regulates flg22-triggered calcium influx but also directly phosphorylates the NADPH oxidase RbohD at specific sites in a calcium-independent manner to enhance ROS generation. Furthermore, BIK1 and RbohD form a pathway that controls stomatal movement in response to flg22, thereby restricting bacterial entry into leaf tissues. These findings highlight a direct role of the FLS2 complex in the regulation of RbohD-mediated ROS production and stomatal defense. ©2014 Elsevier Inc.

84897422815	Histone H3K56 acetylation is required for quelling-induced small RNA production through its role in homologous recombination	Quelling and DNA damage-induced small RNA (qiRNA) production are RNA interference (RNAi)-related phenomenon from repetitive genomic loci in Neurospora. We have recently proposed that homologous recombination from repetitive DNA loci allows the RNAi pathway to recognize repetitive DNA to produce small RNA. However, the mechanistic detail of this pathway remains largely unclear. By systematically screening the Neurospora knock-out library, we identified RTT109 as a novel component required for small RNA production. RTT109 is a histone acetyltransferase for histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) and H3K56 acetylation is essential for the small RNA biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we showed that RTT109 is required for homologous recombination and H3K56Ac is enriched around double strand break, which overlaps with RAD51 binding. Taken together, our results suggest that H3K56 acetylation is required for small RNA production through its role in homologous recombination. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

84899131292	Inhibition of the Arabidopsis Salt Overly Sensitive Pathway by 14-3-3 proteins	The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion (Na+) homeostasis and salt tolerance in plants. Until recently, little was known about the mechanisms that inhibit the SOS pathway when plants are grown in the absence of salt stress. In this study, we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana 14-3-3 proteins λ and κ interact with SOS2 and repress its kinase activity. Growth in the presence of salt decreases the interaction between SOS2 and the 14-3-3 proteins, leading to kinase activation in planta. 14-3-3 λ interacts with the SOS2 junction domain, which is important for its kinase activity. A phosphorylation site (Ser-294) is identified within this domain by mass spectrometry. Mutation of Ser-294 to Ala or Asp does not affect SOS2 kinase activity in the absence of the 14-3-3 proteins. However, in the presence of 14-3-3 proteins, the inhibition of SOS2 activity is decreased by the Ser-to-Ala mutation and enhanced by the Ser-to-Asp exchange. These results identify 14-3-3 λ and κ as important regulators of salt tolerance. The inhibition of SOS2 mediated by the binding of 14-3-3 proteins represents a novel mechanism that confers basal repression of the SOS pathway in the absence of salt stress. © 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists.

84903195579	A Sub-Element in PRE enhances nuclear export of intronless mRNAs by recruiting the TREX complex via ZC3H18	Viral RNA elements that facilitate mRNA export are useful tools for identifying cellular RNA export factors. Here we show that hepatitis B virus post-transcriptional element (PRE) is one such element, and using PRE several new cellular mRNA export factors were identified. We found that PRE drastically enhances the cytoplasmic accumulation of cDNA transcripts independent of any viral protein. Systematic deletion analysis revealed the existence of a 116 nt functional Sub-Element of PRE (SEP1). The RNP that forms on the SEP1 RNA was affinity purified, in which TREX components as well as several other proteins were identified. TREX components and the SEP1-associating protein ZC3H18 are required for SEP1-mediated mRNA export. Significantly, ZC3H18 directly binds to the SEP1 RNA, interacts with TREX and is required for stable association of TREX with the SEP1-containing mRNA. Requirements for SEP1-mediated mRNA export are similar to those for splicing-dependent mRNA export. Consistent with these similarities, several SEP1-interacting proteins, including ZC3H18, ARS2, Acinus and Brr2, are required for efficient nuclear export of polyA RNAs. Together, our data indicate that SEP1 enhances mRNA export by recruiting TREX via ZC3H18. The new mRNA export factors that we identified might be involved in cap-and splicing-dependent TREX recruitment to cellular mRNAs. © 2014 The Author(s) 2014.

84903610772	Coordinated and distinct functions of velvet proteins in Fusarium verticillioides	Velvet-domain-containing proteins are broadly distributed within the fungal kingdom. In the corn pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, previous studies showed that the velvet protein F. verticillioides VE1 (FvVE1) is critical for morphological development, colony hydrophobicity, toxin production, and pathogenicity. In this study, tandem affinity purification of FvVE1 revealed that FvVE1 can form a complex with the velvet proteins F. verticillioides VelB (FvVelB) and FvVelC. Phenotypic characterization of gene knockout mutants showed that, as in the case of FvVE1, FvVelB regulated conidial size, hyphal hydrophobicity, fumonisin production, and oxidant resistance, while FvVelC was dispensable for these biological processes. Comparative transcriptional analysis of eight genes involved in the ROS (reactive oxygen species) removal system revealed that both FvVE1 and FvVelB positively regulated the transcription of a catalase-encoding gene, F. verticillioides CAT2 (FvCAT2). Deletion of FvCAT2 resulted in reduced oxidant resistance, providing further explanation of the regulation of oxidant resistance by velvet proteins in the fungal kingdom. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

84905455015	KLHL40 deficiency destabilizes thin filament proteins and promotes Nemaline myopathy	Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy that can result in lethal muscle dysfunction and is thought to be a disease of the sarcomere thin filament. Recently, several proteins of unknown function have been implicated in NM, but the mechanistic basis of their contribution to disease remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrated that loss of a muscle-specific protein, kelch-like family member 40(KLHL40), results in a nemaline-like myopathy in mice that closely phenocopies muscle abnormalities observed in KLHL40-deficient patients. We determined that KLHL40 localizes to the sarcomere I band and A band and binds to nebulin (NEB), a protein frequently implicated in NM, as well as a putative thin filament protein, leiomodin 3 (LMOD3). KLHL40 belongs to the BTB-BACK-kelch (BBK) family of proteins, some of which have been shown to promote degradation of their substrates. In contrast, we found that KLHL40 promotes stability of NEB and LMOD3 and blocks LMOD3 ubiquitination. Accordingly, NEB and LMOD3 were reduced in skeletal muscle of both Klhl40

84905969608	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus LANA recruits the DNA polymerase clamp loader to mediate efficient replication and virus persistence	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latently infects tumor cells and persists as a multiple-copy, extrachromosomal, circular episome. To persist, the viral genome must replicate with each cell cycle. The KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates viral DNA replication and persistence, but little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms. We find that LANA recruits replication factor C (RFC), the DNA polymerase clamp [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] loader, to drive DNA replication efficiently. Mutated LANA lacking RFC interaction was deficient for LANA-mediated DNA replication and episome persistence. RFC depletion had a negative impact on LANA's ability to replicate and maintain viral DNA in cells containing artificial KSHV episomes or in infected cells, leading to loss of virus. LANA substantially increased PCNA loading onto DNA in vitro and recruited RFC and PCNA to KSHV DNA in cells. These findings suggest that PCNA loading is a rate-limiting step in DNA replication that is incompatible with viral survival. LANA enhancement of PCNA loading permits efficient virus replication and persistence, revealing a previously unidentified mechanism for KSHV latency.

84907270863	Innate immune sensing of bacterial modifications of Rho GTPases by the Pyrin inflammasome	Cytosolic inflammasome complexes mediated by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) defend against pathogen infection by activating caspase 1. Pyrin, a candidate PRR, can bind to the inflammasome adaptor ASC to form a caspase 1-activating complex. Mutations in the Pyrin-encoding gene, MEFV, cause a human autoinflammatory disease known as familial Mediterranean fever. Despite important roles in immunity and disease, the physiological function of Pyrin remains unknown. Here we show that Pyrin mediates caspase 1 inflammasome activation in response to Rho-glucosylation activity of cytotoxin TcdB, a major virulence factor of Clostridium difficile, which causes most cases of nosocomial diarrhoea. The glucosyltransferase-inactive TcdB mutant loses the inflammasome-stimulating activity. Other Rho-inactivating toxins, including FIC-domain adenylyltransferases (Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopS and Histophilus somni IbpA) and Clostridium botulinum ADP-ribosylating C3 toxin, can also biochemically activate the Pyrin inflammasome in their enzymatic activity-dependent manner. These toxins all target the Rho subfamily and modify a switch-I residue. We further demonstrate that Burkholderia cenocepacia inactivates RHOA by deamidating Asn41, also in the switch-I region, and thereby triggers Pyrin inflammasome activation, both of which require the bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS). Loss of the Pyrin inflammasome causes elevated intra-macrophage growth of B. cenocepacia and diminished lung inflammation in mice. Thus, Pyrin functions to sense pathogen modification and inactivation of Rho GTPases, representing a new paradigm in mammalian innate immunity.

84907699044	An iron-containing dodecameric heptosyltransferase family modifies bacterial autotransporters in pathogenesis	Autotransporters deliver virulence factors to the bacterial surface by translocating an effector passenger domain through a membrane-anchored barrel structure. Although passenger domains are diverse, those found in enteric bacteria autotransporters, including AIDA-I in diffusely adhering Escherichia coli (DAEC) and TibA in enterotoxigenic E. coli, are commonly glycosylated. We show that AIDA-I is heptosylated within the bacterial cytoplasm by autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase (AAH) and its paralogue AAH2. AIDA-I heptosylation determines DAEC adhesion to host cells. AAH/AAH2 define a bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family that contains ferric ion and adopts a dodecamer assembly. Structural analyses of the heptosylated TibA passenger domain reveal 35 heptose conjugates forming patterned and solenoid-like arrays on the surface of a β helix. Additionally, CARC, the AIDA-like autotransporter from Citrobacter rodentium, is essential for colonization in mice and requires heptosylation by its cognate BAHT. Our study establishes a bacterial glycosylation system that regulates virulence and is essential for pathogenesis.

84912064200	Structure and Specificity of the Bacterial Cysteine Methyltransferase Effector NleE Suggests a Novel Substrate in Human DNA Repair Pathway	Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and related enterobacteria rely on a type III secretion system (T3SS) effector NleE to block host NF-κB signaling. NleE is a first in class, novel S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase that methylates a zinc-coordinating cysteine in the Npl4-like Zinc Finger (NZF) domains in TAB2/3 adaptors in the NF-κB pathway, but its mechanism of action and other human substrates are unknown. Here we solve crystal structure of NleE-SAM complex, which reveals a methyltransferase fold different from those of known ones. The SAM, cradled snugly at the bottom of a deep and narrow cavity, adopts a unique conformation ready for nucleophilic attack by the methyl acceptor. The substrate NZF domain can be well docked into the cavity, and molecular dynamic simulation indicates that Cys673 in TAB2-NZF is spatially and energetically favorable for attacking the SAM. We further identify a new NleE substrate, ZRANB3, that functions in PCNA binding and remodeling of stalled replication forks at the DNA damage sites. Specific inactivation of the NZF domain in ZRANB3 by NleE offers a unique opportunity to suggest that ZRANB3-NZF domain functions in DNA repair processes other than ZRANB3 recruitment to DNA damage sites. Our analyses suggest a novel and unexpected link between EPEC infection, virulence proteins and genome integrity.

Although the enzymatic production of these bulky epoxides has proven difficult, here we report a method to effectively improve the activity of BmEH, an epoxide hydrolase from Bacillus megaterium ECU1001 toward α-naphthyl glycidyl ether, the precursor of (S)-propranolol, by eliminating the steric hindrance near the potential product-release site. Using X-ray crystallography, mass spectrum, and molecular dynamics calculations, we have identified an active tunnel for substrate access and product release of this enzyme. The crystal structures revealed that there is an independent product-release site in BmEH that was not included in other reported epoxide hydrolase structures. By alanine scanning, two mutants, F128A and M145A, targeted to expand the potential product-release site displayed 42 and 25 times higher activities toward α-naphthyl glycidyl ether than the wild-type enzyme, respectively.

84925284243	O-GlcNAc-modification of SNAP-29 regulates autophagosome maturation	The mechanism by which nutrient status regulates the fusion of autophagosomes with endosomes/lysosomes is poorly understood. Here, we report that O-linked 2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) mediates O-GlcNAcylation of the SNARE protein SNAP-29 and regulates autophagy in a nutrient-dependent manner. In mammalian cells, OGT knockdown, or mutating the O-GlcNAc sites in SNAP-29, promotes the formation of a SNAP-29-containing SNARE complex, increases fusion between autophagosomes and endosomes/lysosomes, and promotes autophagic flux. In Caenorhabditis elegans, depletion of ogt-1 has a similar effect on autophagy; moreover, expression of an O-GlcNAc-defective SNAP-29 mutant facilitates autophagic degradation of protein aggregates. O-GlcNAcylated SNAP-29 levels are reduced during starvation in mammalian cells and in C. Elegans. Our study reveals a mechanism by which O-GlcNAc-modification integrates nutrient status with autophagosome maturation.
