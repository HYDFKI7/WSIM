33750201789	Start control strategy in electronically controlled LPG port injection spark ignition engine	The cold start tests were performed comparatively for the liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and gasoline engines at the ambient temperatures of 9, 15 and 20°C respectively. The results showed that the fuel air mixture suitable for the LPG engine start is leaner than that of the gasoline engine. The first fuel injection pulse width for the start of the gasoline engine is about 6.9 times of that at the normal idle condition, while it needs only 2.5 times for the LPG engine. Because of the lower volumetric efficiency, the initial throttle openings for the start and idling of the LPG engine are larger than those of the gasoline engine. Generally speaking, the start behavior of the LPG engine is better than that of the gasoline engine.

Experiments at 9°C, 15°C and 20°C for cold starting were made on a four-stroke inline sequent port injection engine fueled with LPG. Experimental result shows that by optimizing the control parameters including first injection pulse width, injection descending ramp, initial throttle opening width and descending ramp, the LPG engine can start smoothly with stable combustion, reliable starting and short time for rich mixture supplying. Both LPG engine and gasoline engine require rich mixture for cold starting.

The period of providing rich mixture can be contracted and the throttle open width should be larger for bringing the same torque when using LPG fuel.

The results showed that the methanol injection quantity per cycle, the ignition timing, the methanol injection timing, the mass ratio of injected LPG/ methanol, and the LPG injection timing delay relative to the methanol injection timing affect the formaldehyde and the unburned methanol emissions significantly. Optimal control of the methanol injection quantity per cycle, the ignition timing, the methanol injection timing, and the LPG injection timing delay relative to the methanol injection timing improves firing performances and reduces the unburned methanol emission. As the mass ratio of injected LPG/methanol increases, the formaldehyde emission increases and the unburned methanol emission falls. The variations in emitted formaldehyde and unburned methanol show opposite tendencies with the variations in the methanol injection quantity per cycle, the ignition timing, the methanol injection timing, the mass ratio of injected LPG/methanol, and the LPG injection timing delay relative to the methanol injection timing.

84865814860	Design and experimental investigation of engine measurement system of piston position under all operating conditions	The measurement system of engine piston position under all-operating condition was designed. Using specific binary coded target and photoelectric sensors, the lower frequency limit of traditional magnetoelectric sensor was broken, and the piston position calibration table and the corresponding algorithms table was designed, so the development of operating conditions for instantaneous reverse direct start & stop system of gasoline direct injection engine was covered, which meant piston position, phase, rotate direction signal and rotate speed can be measured under all operating conditions. The test bench for stopping test was established by gasoline direct injection(GDI) engine, and the stopping test without load when the temperature of cooling water is 90°C was made. The test result shows that stop behavior of engine follows the characteristic, that is, "forward-reverse-forward". The reversal range is between 65~75°CA, and the maximum reversal speed is 70 r/min. The forward range is between 2~5°CA, and the maximum forward speed is 40 r/min. The stop behavior is that piston-connecting rodcrankshaft-flywheel and its surrounding become the dissipative system of surplus kinetic energy.

84867175025	Large eddy simulation and characteristic prediction of transient two-phase flow for hydraulic retarder	In order to obtain the velocity and pressure distribution characteristics in each flow unit field, the full-flow channel geometry model was extracted as compute domain to conduct the three-dimension transient numerical simulation of gas-liquid two-phase flow in hydraulic retarder based on the large eddy simulation method and sliding mesh theory for multi-flow regions coupled calculation in CFD software. Mixture model and Eulerian model were used alternately to achieve the structure change of internal flow field and the volume distribution of the two-phase flow under different filling rate. The generation mechanism of secondary flow, flow separation and vortex was analyzed, and the external retarder characteristic was also calculated. The results show that the numerical results are in good consistency with experimental data with the error less than 8%. The large eddy simulation method can effectively simulate the true flow structure in hydraulic retarder flow field and conduct retarder design and structural optimization.

84869395459	Study on energy saving by means and potentiality of hybrid wheel loader with energy materials	Based on the characteristics of high fluctuation and periodicity of output power during working process of wheel loader, hybrid drive technology can provide a solution for fuel saving and fuel reduction of wheel loader through power adjustment function and energy recycle feature. Aiming at power output motion of wheel loader duty cycle, 7 means for hybrid wheel loader to save fuel have been proposed; contribution to save fuel and easiness to realize the goal under current technical conditions of each means has also been assessed. It is considered that there are two categories of wheel loader energy saving technology: one is to increase fuel utilization rate, and the other is improve transmission efficiency of torque converter. However, realizing one of these two aspects can not save fuel ideally; improvement in both aspects will bring satisfactory energy materials saving effects. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84868650578	Research on modeling method of turbocharger waste gate response model	To solve the problem of severe torque fluctuation in rated power conditions of natural gas engine resulted from waste gate abnormal opening owing to exhaust pressure fluctuation by using simulation method, a turbocharger waste gate physical model was established instead of traditional PID method. Analyzed the forces applied on the waste gate, a pressure spring-force balance model was created using mechanical modules in GT-Power software and the 3 main factors influencing engine torque fluctuation, waste gate spring preload, stiffness and system damping, were investigated based on the model. It is concluded that spring stiffness is the most important one and the optimized value 2200 N/m is recommended. Engine bench tests verify that using improved waste gate the maximum torque fluctuation amplitude is reduced from original 70 N·m to 19 N·m, 27% better. The transient simulation method can be served to effectively work out the improved scheme and predict its effect.

84875986316	Study on power delivering in energy management for hybrid electric vehicle	The equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is a method to reduce the global minimization problem to an instantaneous minimization problem to be solved at each instant. The adaptive ECMS is a development of ECMS in which the equivalence factors are not pre-coded, but rather calculated online. The equivalence factors, their optimal value, which minimizes the cost function while maintaining the vehicle substantially charge sustaining, depends on the specific driving cycle. The method proposed in this paper is one of the most important simplifications for actual real time implementation of A-ECMS and power delivering in energy management for HEV. The charging factor can be calculated if the discharging factor is calculated in the experiment for real time. And only a subset of (charging and discharging factors) generates a trend close to zero which indicates charge-sustainability. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
