24644457587	PLS algorithms for equality-constrained linear-phase FIR filter design	The least-squares design of linear-phase finite impulse response (FIR) filters with equality constraints in the time and frequency domains can be formulated as an equality-constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem. This paper presents an effective and robust novel algorithm, the projected least-squares (PLS) algorithm, for equality-constrained QP problems. The algorithm eventually projects an unconstrained minimization solution successively onto the feasible hyperplane of the problem. An additional term is added into the Hessian matrix of the cost function, thus ensuring the positive definiteness of the Hessian matrices during the iterative procedure for the design of constrained minimax filters. To demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, the PLS algorithm is applied to design optimal linear-phase Nyquist filters that may satisfy some frequency domain constraints besides the zero-crossing impulse response. © Birkhäuser Boston (2005).

27144433219	Single-machine partial rescheduling with Bi-criterion based on genetic algorithm	A partial rescheduling (PR) heuristic is presented for single machine with unforeseen breakdowns. Unlike a full rescheduling strategy where all unfinished jobs are considered, a PR strategy reschedules partial unfinished jobs which form a PR problem, and shifts the rest jobs to the right according to the solution of the PR problem. The rescheduling problem considers a bi-criterion that optimizes both shop efficiency (i.e. makespan performance of the schedule) and stability (i.e. deviation from the original schedule). A genetic algorithm is developed to solve the PR problem. Extensive computational testing was conducted. The computational results show that the PR heuristic with bi-criterion can significantly improve schedule stability with little sacrifice in efficiency, and provide a reasonable trade-off between solution quality and computational efforts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

28444441289	Projected least-squares algorithms for constrained FIR filter design	Constrained finite-impulse response (FIR) filter design with time- and frequency-domain linear constraints can be generally transformed into a, or a series of, constrained least-squares problems, which can be generally reformulated as positive definite quadratic programming (QP) problems. This paper presents a novel algorithm referred to as a projected least-squares (PLS) algorithm for the positive definite QP problems. The PLS algorithm essentially projects the unconstrained (least-squares) minimization solution successively onto the boundaries of active constraints that are identified by an active-set strategy. The PLS algorithm has been applied to the constrained least-squares design of FIR filters directly, and to the constrained Chebyshev design of FIR filters in an iterative fashion. The PLS algorithm is compared with the most widely used interior-point methods and an active-set method through design examples of low-pass filters with specified passband and stopband ripples, Nyquist filter constraints and step response constraints. All these examples demonstrate the high efficiency of the PLS algorithm. © 2005 IEEE.

However, since the Haar condition is not necessarily satisfied in the new function space, the alternating property does not hold for the solution to the resulted unconstrained Chebyshev approximation problem. A sufficient condition for the best approximation is obtained in this brief, and based on this condition, an efficient single exchange algorithm is derived for the Chebyshev design of linear-phase FIR filters with linear equality constraints.

84907921177	Design of allpass IIR digital filters using a minimax frequency response error method	The design of allpass infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters is usually to minimize the maximum or weighted square sum of the phase response error since the magnitude response of the filter is constant over the whole frequency band. Considering that the magnitude of the frequency response error of an allpass filter is a monotonic function of its absolute phase response error, this paper applies the minimax frequency response error design methods for general IIR filters to the design of allpass IIR filters. By using the specific form of the frequency response of an allpass IIR filter in design methods for general IIR filters, this paper obtains three kinds of new algorithms for the minimax design of allpass IIR filters. In order to reduce the group delay error of the designed filters, the envelope of the group delay error is used to reweight the frequency response error, resulting in near equiripple group delay error response with a much smaller maximum value. Design examples demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

84907942339	Minimax phase error design of stable IIR filters using a sequential minimization method	For the design of IIR digital filters, one challenge is their inherent non-linear phase responses. The double-ellipse model controls the phase error and magnitude error separately and is a good candidate for near linear-phase IIR filter design. Another challenge is their stability conditions. The stability-triangle condition defines a necessary and sufficient stability domain of an IIR filter, and thus is much preferable in the design of IIR filters. This paper incorporates the stability-triangle conditions with the double-ellipse model, and then applies a sequential minimization method to solve the magnitude constrained minimax phase error design of IIR filters. Design examples demonstrate that the proposed method has obtained better filters with smaller phase error than existing algorithms.

The central problem of this paper is the constrained Chebyshev design of finite-impulse response filters with equation and inequality constraints in the frequency domain. By converting the problem into a series of Chebyshev design problems with equation constraints, an iterative MRemez algorithm which uses the MRemez algorithm as the computational core of the iteration is proposed, and the convergence of the algorithm is obtained.

67249101234	Minimax design of FIR Nyquist filters Using a quadratic programming method	FIR Nyquist filters play important roles in communication applications. Minimax filters are very attractive because of their minimal maximum approximation error. Minimax FIR Nyquist filters, however, may not satisfy the alternating theorem. Thus the efficient multiple-exchange design algorithms are not guaranteed to converge or may not converge to minimax filters. By trading off the minimax and the least-squares criterions, a positive definite quadratic programming formulation of the design problem is obtained. It is shown that under sufficiently small tradeoff factor, the resulted filter is actually a minimax one. Using this method, many FIR Nyquist filters have been designed. Comparison with existing algorithms demonstrates the effectiveness and the efficiency of the method. © 2008 IEEE.

Existing methods for low group-delay FIR filter design usually result in large group delay error, noticeably towards the bandedges. Recently, Lai [2] presented a constrained least-squares design method that can specify both magnitude-error and phase-error upper bounds. Reduced group-delay error can be obtained by using a sigmoid phase-error upper-bound function in the method. In this paper, we improve the method by using a modified complex approximation error, such that we can more flexibly specify the magnitude and phase errors, and smaller magnitude error can be obtained under the same phase-error constraint. A multiple-exchange algorithm is used to solve the complex-error and phase-error constrained least-squares design problem.

71449088246	A new minimax design of two-dimensional FIR filters with reduced group delay	Research effort that has been spent on the minimax design of two-dimensional (2-0) FIR filters mainly focuses on linear-phase filters. Recent methods for the minimax design of 2-0 FIR filter with reduced group delay minimize the maximum magnitude of the complex error between the desired and actual frequency responses. The maximum magnitude respon se and phase respon se errors are uniquely determined by the maximum magnitude of the complex error, and approximately have the same value . This paper presents a new minimax criterion, where the maximum magnitude of a modified approximation error is minimized, and the maximum absolute phase error is specified. This criterion provides more design tlexibiIities than that by merely minimizing the maximum complexerror magnitude, and may result in smaller maximum magnitude error and/or phase error. By adding a scaled energy of the complex error to the cost function, we obtain a unique minimax filter with the least complex-error energy among all minimax solutions. The design problem is reformulated in a semi-definite programming (SOP) that allow existing SOP solvers to apply. Design examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ©2009 ACA.

80053088386	A sequential constrained minimax design method of IIR digital filters	The magnitude response of an unconstrained minimax infinite impulse response digital filter usually has a heavy overshoot in the transition band and large group-delay error near the passband edges. This paper imposes a constraint on the frequency responses and makes the magnitude responses in the transition bands approximate some preset monotonically increasing and/or decreasing functions as well as possible. We present a sequential constrained minimax design method that formulates the design problem as a series of constrained minimax problems with given maximum frequency response error in the transition bands. The method can not only minimizes the maximum error of frequency response on the passband and stopband, but also effectively decreases the magnitude overshoot on the transition bands and the group-delay error near the passband edges. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2011 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

80053606083	A fast matrix iterative technique for the WLS design of 2-D quadrantally symmetic FIR filters	High computational complexity is a major problem encountered in the optimal design of two-dimensional (2-D) finite impulse response (FIR) filters. In this paper, we present an iterative matrix solution with very low complexity to the weighted least square (WLS) design of 2-D quadrantally symmetric FIR filters with two-valued weighting functions. Firstly, a necessary and sufficient condition for the WLS design of 2-D quadrantally symmetric filters with general nonnegative weighting functions is obtained. Then, based on this optimality condition, a novel iterative algorithm is derived for the WLS design problem with a two-valued weighting function. Because the filter parameters are arranged in their natural 2-D form and the transition band is not sampled, the computation amount of the proposed algorithm is reduced significantly, especially for high-order filters. The exponential convergence of the algorithm is established, and its computational complexity is estimated. Design examples demonstrating the convergence rate and solution accuracy of the algorithm, as well as the relation between the iteration number of the algorithm and the size and transition-band width of the filter are given. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84858224325	Design of stable IIR filters using a sequential constrained minimax procedure and second-order factor updates	A minimax infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filter often has an obvious magnitude overshoot in the transition band and a large group delay error near the passband edge. We recently presented a sequential constrained minimax (SCMM) method to design IIR filters with reduced magnitude overshoot and group delay error. In this paper, we combine the SCMM method with a sequential minimization procedure based on second-order factor updates (SMSOF) to further improve the design results by using stability triangles as the stability constraints. Design examples demonstrate that the proposed method not only makes the maximum frequency response error on the passband and stopband as small as possible, but also reduces the magnitude overshoot in the transition band and the group delay error near the passband edge. © 2011 IEEE.

84855959276	Minimax phase error design of IIR digital filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses	Infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters with prescribed magnitude and phase responses have been used in many applications. To approximate the prescribed magnitude and phase responses, we propose a new approach to the design of general IIR filters by minimizing the maximum phase error subject to a prescribed or simultaneously minimized maximum magnitude error, where the phase error and magnitude error are controlled by two elliptic constraints respectively with major and minor axes along the desired frequency response. The sequential constrained least-squares method and Levy-Sanathanan-Koerner strategy are used to convert the nonconvex constraints into convex ones, resulting in a series of convex optimization subproblems. Design examples and comparisons with recent methods demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2011 IEEE.

84864517949	A sequential constrained Chebyshev design method of IIR digital filters	The magnitude response of unconstrained Chebyshev infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters usually demonstrates an obvious overshoot in the transition band and large group-delay error near the passband edge. This paper presents a sequential constrained Chebyshev (SCC) method that formulates the design as a series of constrained Chebyshev problems by minimizing the Chebyshev norm of the error between the transition-band frequency response (FR) and a preset monotonically increasing/decreasing transient function subject to a constraint that the maximum magnitude of the passband and stopband FR error is smaller than a given value ρ, the minimum value of which is obtained by a shrinking followed by bisection search. The SCC method can not only render as small as possible the maximum magnitude of the passband and stopband FR error, but also reduce obviously the magnitude overshoot on the transition band and the group-delay error near the passband edge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

84867627918	Minimax design of nonnegative finite impulse response filters	Nonnegative impulse response (NNIR) filters have found many applications in signal processing and information fusion areas. Evidence filtering is one of the examples among others. An evidence filter is required to satisfy a nonnegativity condition and a normalization condition on its impulse response coefficients, and thus is basically an NNIR filter. This paper considers the design of nonnegative finite impulse response (FIR) filters based on frequency response approximation and proposes a constrained minimax design formulation using the fundamental limitations on the NNIR filter's frequency responses recently developed in the literature. The formulation is converted into a linearly constrained positive-definite quadratic programming and then solved with the Goldfarb-Idnani algorithm. The proposed method is applicable to nonnegative FIR lowpass as well as other types of filters. Design examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2012 ISIF (Intl Society of Information Fusi).

84873541218	A sequential minimization procedure for least-squares design of stable IIR filters	Since infinite impulse response (IIR) digital filters do not have intrinsic stability, one of the main problems needed to be considered in their optimal designs is to choose proper stability constraints to insure the stability of the designed filters. The stability-triangle based conditions are necessary and sufficient as well as linear conditions for the stability of IIR filters. In order to make good use of these conditions, a second-order factor based sequential minimization procure is used to convert the least-squares design of an IIR digital filter into a sequence of least-squares sub-problems, each of which optimizes the whole numerator but only one second-order denominator factor while keeping all other denominator factors unchanged. Design examples show that the proposed procedure may obtain much better lease-squares filters. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

84873650225	Theory and design of linear-phase minimax FIR filters with mixed constraints in the frequency domain	The alternation theorem is the core of efficient approximation algorithms for the minimax design of finite-impulse response (FIR) filters. In this paper, an extended alternation theorem with additional mixed constraints, i.e., equality-and-inequality constraints, is obtained. Then, an efficient multiple-exchange algorithm based on the extended theorem is presented for designing linear-phase FIR filters with frequency mixed constraints in the minimax sense. Further, convergence of the algorithm is established. Several design examples and comparisons with existing techniques are presented, and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is numerically more efficient and guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84873530436	An efficient algorithm for constrained least-square design of quadrantally symmetric two-dimensional fir filters	A key problem for optimal design of two-dimensional (2-D) finite impulse response (FIR) filters is the efficiency of the design algorithm. Most existing algorithms have low computational efficiencies since they rearrange the coefficient matrix of a 2-D FIR filter into a vector and then solve for the coefficient vector using design algorithms for one-dimensional (1-D) FIR filters. Some 2-D based algorithms for least-square (LS) and weighted LS designs of 2-D FIR filters are very efficient because they directly compute or update the coefficient matrices of the filters. This paper considers the constrained LS (CLS) design of quadrantally symmetric 2-D FIR filters and presents a computationally efficient algorithm for the design. This algorithm generalizes the 2-D based LS design algorithm by imposing constraints on the magnitude response error of the filter such that it can efficiently solve the CLS design problems of the 2-D FIR filters. The algorithm can also be regarded as an extension of the projected LS algorithm for the CLS designs of 1-D FIR filters. Design examples and comparisons with existing algorithms demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. © 2012 Chinese Assoc of Automati.

84879687915	Efficient 2-D based algorithms for WLS designs of 2-D FIR filters with arbitrary weighting functions	The impulse response coefficients of a two-dimensional (2-D) finite impulse response (FIR) filter naturally constitute a matrix. It has been shown by several researchers that, two-dimension (2-D) based algorithms that retain the natural matrix form of the 2-D filter's coefficients are computationally much more efficient than the conventional one-dimension (1-D) based algorithms that rearrange the coefficient matrix into a vector. In this paper, two 2-D based algorithms are presented for the weighted least squares (WLS) design of quadrantally symmetric 2-D FIR filters with arbitrary weighting functions. Both algorithms are based on matrix iterative techniques with guaranteed convergence, and they solve the WLS design problems accurately and efficiently. The convergence rate, solution accuracy and design time of these proposed algorithms are demonstrated and compared with existing algorithms through two design examples. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

84880171593	Matrix-based algorithms for constrained least-squares and minimax designs of 2-D linear-phase FIR filters	The impulse response coefficients of a two-dimensional (2-D) finite impulse response (FIR) filter are in a matrix form in nature. Conventional optimal design algorithms rearrange the filter's coefficient matrix into a vector and then solve for the coefficient vector using design algorithms for one-dimensional (1-D) FIR filters. Some recent design algorithms have exploited the matrix nature of the 2-D filter's coefficients but not incorporated with any constraints, and thus are not applicable to the design of 2-D filters with explicit magnitude constraints. In this paper, we develop some efficient algorithms exploiting the coefficients' matrix nature for the constrained least-squares (CLS) and minimax designs of quadrantally symmetric 2-D linear-phase FIR filters, both of which can be formulated as an optimization problem or converted into a sequence of subproblems with a positive-definite quadratic cost and a finite number of linear constraints expressed in terms of the filter's coefficient matrix. Design examples and comparisons with several existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

The new algorithm is based on the optimality condition and uses the matrix iterative technique, which retains the coefficients of 2-D filters in their natural matrix form, resulting in a considerable saving in the amount of computation and memory space. Moreover, two vectors are introduced into the iterative equation of the algorithm, aiming to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence.

84883413005	Design and application of allpass filters with equiripple group delay errors	Allpass filters have found many applications in signal processing areas. In this paper, an iterative linear programming (LP) algorithm is first presented to solve the minimax phase error design of allpass filters. Then an iterative weighted minimax (WMM) method is presented to design allpass filters with equi-ripple group delay errors. Finally, the iterative WMM method is applied to the design of allpass-filter-based halfband filters with equiripple constant group delays. Design examples demonstrate that the new iterative LP algorithm is very efficient for the minimax allpass filter design, and the iterative WMM method is very effective for the equiripple constant group delay designs of allpass filters and allpass-filter-based halfband filters. © 2013 IEEE.

84885695631	A rolling horizon procedure with terminal penalty for large-scale single machine scheduling problems	A more general rolling horizon procedure with terminal penalty (TP-RHP) is proposed for the single machine scheduling problems with release dates where the objective is to minimize a regular sum criterion. In TP-RHP, a sub-problem with global performance is formulated by adding the terminal penalty cost to the local performance of a local sub-problem of the RHP during the rolling procedure. The terminal penal function is estimated with an approximate cost-to-go function with a heuristic method. Theorems show that the TP-RHP method improves the procedure solution as the iteration goes forward and the global performance of the ultimate solution is always better than the heuristics. © IFAC.

84890545255	Minimax design of IIR digital filters with near-uniform group delay error	Digital filters are often required to have constant group delays in many applications. Though some existing designs of IIR digital filters have obtained both small magnitude error and phase error, they often lead to large group-delay error, especially near the band edges. In this paper, we design the IIR filter by imposing two elliptical constraints respectively on magnitude error and phase error and using a modified envelope of the group-delay error to shape the phase error. With this method, we have obtained comparably small phase error and greatly reduced group-delay error. The resulting optimization problem is a nonconvex one, we propose to use the Levy-Sanathanan-Koerner strategy and a sequential constrained least-squares method to convert the nonconvex problem into a sequence of easily solvable convex problems. Design examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 TCCT, CAA.

The stability-triangle is a necessary-sufficient linear stability condition for IIR digital filters. In order to make good use of the stability-triangle condition, a sequential minimization procedure based on secondorder factor is employed to convert the constrained least-squares design of IIR digital filters into a sequence of constrained least-squares sub-problems, each of which optimizes only one second-order denominator factor while keeping all the rest denominator factors unchanged. Design examples show that the proposed procedure provides better filtering performances than other existing methods.

84896290066	Fast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging based on an improved Motion Estimation/Motion Compensation scheme	Compressed Sensing (CS) increases the speed of MRI by reducing the sampling data. k-t FOCUSS is an effective CS algorithm for image reconstruction in dynamic MRI. In this method, in order to further improve its performance, a predictive frame is first obtained using the Motion Estimation (ME) and Motion Compensation (MC) algorithms, and the quality of reconstructed images can then be enhanced by the study of sparsity of the residuals based on the improved predictive frame. However, traditional MC algorithm usually causes block artifacts. In this work, an Overlapped Block Motion Compensation (OBMC) scheme was used to overcome this problem. Two reference frames, located at systole and diastole periods, were both acquired to improve the predication accuracy. Experimental results show that, the k-t FOCUSS with ME/MC and OBMC can successfully suppress the image artifacts generated by the standard k-t FOCUSS with ME/MC. © 2013 IEEE.

84899118487	A new iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for the design of FIR filters	It is known that iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithms are efficient techniques for the design of digital filters. The main computational load in IRLS algorithms is to solve a series of weighted least squares (WLS) subproblems, which usually needs the time-consuming evaluation of matrix inversion. This paper presents a new and very efficient IRLS algorithm, in which a simple iterative procedure is developed for solving those WLS subproblems. It is verified that the iterative procedure is guaranteed to converge and is computationally more efficient than using matrix inversion. Thus, the design efficiency is improved greatly, especially for high-order filters. Design examples and comparisons to some existing algorithms are given to show the excellent performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.

84907388045	A sequential weighted least squares procedure for design of IIR filters and two-channel IIR filter banks	This paper proposes a weighted least squares (WLS) optimization procedure for the design of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters and IIR two-channel quadrature mirror filter banks (FB). The original WLS design problem is converted to a sequence of WLS sub-problems. In each of the WLS sub-problems, only one second-order factor of the denominator and the numerator is updated and iteratively solved by a constrained WLS algorithm. Using the same IIR filter from a recent work, the proposed method shows a better performance in terms of all the measured errors. For the FB, the lowpass filter is designed using a ladder structure through an allpass filter and desirable performance is achieved using a low order allpass filter. © 2014 IEEE.
