17044438337	Combining a cost-benefit algorithm for ECTEP into the product structure diagram	This study presents a cost-benefit algorithm for Expediting the Completion Time of End Product (ECTEP) in the Product Structure Diagram (PSD) using the Critical Path Method (CPM) and the time-costing method. The classic PSD provides essential information for the consequent Material Requirement Planning (MRP). Selecting an appropriate acquisition method (either a particular manufacturing process or a specific speed of assembly or a specific supplier) for each component part is one of the early tasks faced by a product/process design team and it is critical because the resulting decisions are then translated into the PSD and its subsequent MRP. This study incorporates a cost-benefit decision procedure into the PSD for determining the optimal component procuring alternatives that not only expedites the completion time of the end product but also maximises the benefits. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate its practical usage. Copyright © 2005 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

31344439916	The finite production model with the reworking of defective items	This paper examines the finite production model with the reworking of defective items and shortage not permitted. In most practical settings, due to process deterioration or other factors, the generation of imperfect quality items is inevitable. In this study, the defective rate is assumed to be a random variable and all of the nonconforming items are reworked and repaired. When regular production process ends, the rework starts immediately. Repairing and holding costs for each reworked items are included in the proposed mathematical modeling and analysis. The optimal lot size that minimizes the expected overall costs for the imperfect quality finite production model is derived where shortages are not permitted.

31344465116	Solving an EPQ model with rework and service level constraint	This paper examines an economic production quantity (EPQ) model with rework and service level constraint. First, we prove that the expected overall costs for an imperfect EPQ model with backlogging permitted is less than or equal to that of the one without backlogging. Secondly, the relationship between "imputed backorder cost" and maximal shortage level is derived for decision-making on whether the required service level is achievable. Then an equation for calculating the intangible backorder cost is proposed for situation when the required service level is not attainable. By including this intangible backorder cost in mathematical analysis, one can derive a new optimal lot-size policy that minimizes expected total costs as well as satisfies the maximal shortage level constraint for the EPQ model with rework.

33748703640	Determining expedited time and cost of the end product with defective component parts using critical path method (CPM) and time-costing method	This paper extends an existing work that dealt with the issue of expediting completion time of the end product (ECTEP) and presents a revised algorithm for determining the expedited time and cost of end product in product structure diagram that takes defective component parts into consideration. The algorithm for ECTEP problem proposed in prior work assumes that all component-parts produced or purchased are of perfect quality. However, in real-life situations, production of defective items is inevitable. This study incorporates an adjusted unit procurement cost and adjusted quantity into the ECTEP solution procedure to cope with the existence of defective materials. Both stationary and random defective rates are examined. Critical path method and time-costing technique are employed for determining optimal component procuring alternatives when expediting end product's completion time is desired.

33846655633	Determining the optimal run time for EPQ model with scrap, rework, and stochastic breakdowns	This paper is concerned with determination of optimal run time for an economic production quantity (EPQ) model with scrap, rework, and stochastic machine breakdowns. In real life manufacturing systems, generation of defective items and random breakdown of production equipment are inevitable. In this study, a portion of the defective items is considered to be scrap, while the other is assumed to be repairable. Total production-inventory cost functions are derived respectively for both EPQ models with breakdown (no-resumption policy is adopted) and without breakdown taking place. These cost functions are integrated and the renewal reward theorem is used to cope with the variable cycle length. Theorems on conditional convexity of the integrated overall costs and bounds of the production run time are proposed and proved. We conclude that the optimal run time falls within the range of bounds and it can be pinpointed by the use of the bisection method based on the intermediate value theorem.

34047209466	Optimal order policy for EQQ model under shortage level constraint	This paper studies the optimal order policy for the economic order quantity (EOQ) inventory model under maximal shortage level constraint. We first prove that total inventory cost per unit time for the classic EOQ model with backlogging permitted is less than or equal to that of the EOQ model with shortage not allowed. Secondly, the relationship between the "imputed backorder cost" and the maximal proportion of shortage permitted time per cycle is derived for decision-making on whether the service level can be accomplished or not. Finally, an equation for calculating the intangible backorder cost is proposed for the situation when the required service level is not achievable. By incorporating this intangible backorder cost, the newly derived optimal order policy is able to achieve the necessary service level as well as to minimize the overall inventory costs.

34047234084	A modified version of the part period lot-sizing heuristic	This paper proposes a modified version of the part period lot-sizing heuristic for the case of deterministic time-varying demands. The Part Period Balancing heuristic (PPB) is to select the number of periods covered by the replenishment order such that the total holding costs are made as close as possible to the setup cost. This paper presents a modification of the PPB by adding a procedure to the end of the PPB to test whether the elimination of last replenishment order by combining it with the preceding order is cost-beneficial. If the condition holds, then it amalgamates the last two replenishment lot-sizes, and hence total inventory costs are reduced. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate its practical usage and the proof of cost saving of the proposed mv-PPB heuristic is given in Appendix.

The existing cost-benefit ECTEP algorithm assumes that all materials produced or purchased are of perfect quality. However, the procurement of defective materials in a real-life situation is inevitable. This study extends the algorithm to take imperfect-quality component parts into consideration. Adjusted unit procurement cost and adjusted required quantity are incorporated to address the issue of defective materials procured. Both random and stationary imperfect quality rates are examined.

In most real-life manufacturing settings, generation of defective items is inevitable. Reworking of defective items may significantly reduce overall costs. We derive an optimal operating policy and prove that the expected overall costs of such a production system with backlogging permitted is less than or equal to that of the same model without backlogging. Then the relationship between the "imputed backorder cost" and maximal permitted shortage level is derived for decision-making on whether the required service level is achievable. In the case that the required service level is not attainable, an equation for calculating the intangible backorder cost is proposed.

84877839276	An innovative approach for detection of slight surface variations on capacitor chips	This paper presents an innovative approach to develop a machine vision-based quality inspection system for surface variation detection on passive components. The developed system applies discrete cosine transform (DCT) based image reconstruction method for automated detection of slight surface variations on capacitor chips. We first perform the DCT transformation to transform a spatial domain image into the frequency domain. From the energy concentration analysis of the DCT domain, we can disassemble the frequency matrix into four disassembled matrices. We select the proper number of larger frequency values to represent the random structure features of the capacitor chip surface from the disassembled matrices. Then, we set the selected frequency values to zero and reconstruct the image. For a defective capacitor chip, the slight surface variations will be reserved and the random patterns will be eliminated in the restored image. Finally, the entropy method is applied to setting a threshold for distinguishing between slight surface variation regions and uniform regions in the restored image. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a high 96.66% probability of correctly discriminating slight surface variations from normal regions and a low 0.12% probability of erroneously detecting normal regions as slight variations on random textured surfaces of capacitor chips. © 2013 ICIC International.

Convexity of the expected production- inventory cost function is proved. An optimal replenishment policy that minimizes overall costs is derived for such an unreliable system. Numerical example is provided to show its practical usage. Managers in the field can adopt this run time decision to establish their own robust production plan accordingly.

In most realistic manufacturing processes, generation of defective items and random machine breakdowns are inevitable. In this study, a random defective rate is assumed and all defective items produced are reworked when regular production ends. The rework process is assumed to be imperfect. A proportion of reworked items fail during the reworking and become scrap. The system is subject to random breakdowns. The A/R inventory control policy is adopted when breakdowns occur, under such a policy, and the production of the interrupted lot will be immediately resumed when the machine is fixed and restored. Mathematical modelling is used and the integrated long-run average production-inventory cost per unit time is derived. Theorems on conditional convexity and on bounds of optimal production run times are proposed and proved. A recursive searching algorithm is developed for locating the optimal run time within the bounds, which minimizes the expected production-inventory costs.

Owing to their space saving, energy efficiency, and low radiation, LCD's have been widely applied in many high-tech industries. However, the display blemishes such as abnormal spots (white and black spots) and slight color variations (bright and dark regions) often exist in LCD's. To detect these color unevenness blemish detection, this research proposes a multivariate statistic based hybrid defect detection approach. We first use multivariate Hotelling statistics to integrate different coordinates of color models and construct a Hotelling distance diagram to represent the degree of color variations for selecting suspected blemish regions. Then, an ant colony algorithm that integrates computer vision techniques precisely identifies the abnormal spot defects in the Hotelling distance diagram. And, the back propagation neural network model determines the regions of slight color variation blemishes based on the Hotelling distance values. Experimental results demonstrate the validness and efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

78649367265	Mathematical modelling for determining economic batch size and optimal number of deliveries for EPQ model with quality assurance	The classic economic production quantity (EPQ) model assumes a continuous inventoryissuing policy for satisfying product demand and a perfect production for all items produced. However, in a real-life vendor-buyer integrated system, a multi-delivery policy is often used in lieu of continuous issuing policy and it is inevitable to generate defective items during a production run. This study addresses these issues by incorporating multiple deliveries of the finished batch, customer's inventory-holding cost and manufacturer's quality assurance cost into an EPQ model with the imperfect reworking of random defective items. Mathematical modelling and analyses are employed. Convexity of the long-run expected cost function is proved by the use of Hessian matrix equations, and the closed-form solutions in terms of the optimal lot size and optimal number of deliveries are obtained.

The excellences of the chip-type components are accomplished through rigorous controlling of every production step, especially the accuracy-demanding chip dicing operation. This research develops a machine vision system to find mass centers of chips, locate cutting lines and estimate process regulation plans for the automated, precise, and high-speed dicing of the chip-type components. The radial basis function (RBF) network and the engineering process control (EPC) method with response surface methodology are proposed to model the dicing deviations, and to timely and quantitatively regulate the process towards the target values. Experimental results show that the proposed process regulation approaches significantly outperform the current dicing method in adjustment performance. © 2010 ISSN.

An n+1 delivery policy is proposed here in lieu of n multi-delivery plan used by the prior paper. Under such a policy, an initial (additional) installment of finished products is shipped to customer within the production uptime for satisfying product demand during producer's regular production and rework times. Fixed quantity n installments of finished items are then distributed to customer at a fixed interval of time, at the end of rework. Mathematical modeling and analyses are employed in this study. As a result, the optimal replenishment lot size solution is derived.

In real life manufacturing systems, generation of nonconforming items and unexpected breakdown of production equipment are inevitable. For the purpose of addressing these practical issues, this paper studies a system that may produce defective items randomly and it is also subject to a random equipment failure. A no resumption inventory control policy is adopted when breakdown occurs. Under such a policy, the interrupted lot is aborted and malfunction machine is immediately under repair. A new lot will be started only when all on-hand inventory are depleted. Modeling and numerical analyses are used to establish the solution procedure for such a problem.

These energy features of each block are integrated by the 2 T statistic and the suspected defect blocks can be determined by the multivariate statistical method. Then, the grey clustering algorithm based on the block grey relational grades is conducted to further confirm the block locations of real defects. Finally, a simple segmentation method is applied to set a threshold for distinguishing between defective areas and uniform regions. Experimental results show the defect detection rate of the proposed method is 94.64% better than those of traditional spatial and frequency domain techniques. © 2011 Academic Journals.

80051594167	Mathematical modeling for determining the replenishment policy for EMQ model with rework and multiple shipments	This paper uses mathematical modeling to determine optimal inventory replenishment policy for the economic manufacturing quantity (EMQ) with rework and multiple shipments. The classic EMQ model considers a continuous inventory issuing policy for satisfying customer's demands. It also assumes that all products produced are of perfect quality. However, in a real world vendor-buyer integrated environment, multi-shipment policy is practically used in lieu of the continuous issuing approach and generation of random defective items is inevitable. In this study, we assume the reworking of all defective items takes place when the regular production process ends in each cycle. Failure in repair exists; a portion of reworked items fails during the reworking and becomes scrap. The finished items can only be delivered to customers if the whole lot is quality assured at the end of rework. Fixed quantity multiple installments of the finished batch are delivered to customers at a fixed interval of time. Mathematical modeling and analysis are employed in this study for solving such a realistic EMQ model. The long-run average cost function is derived, its convexity is proved, and a closed-form optimal manufacturing lot size is obtained. Two special cases to the proposed model are examined. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

81855164891	Replenishment run time problem with machine breakdown and failure in rework	This paper studies the optimal replenishment run time for a production system with stochastic machine breakdown and failure in rework. In most real world manufacturing processes, generation of defective items and random breakdown of equipment are inevitable. This research addresses such reliability issues by examining a production system with a Poisson breakdown rate and an imperfect reworking process. When machine breaks down, no-resumption policy is adopted. Under such a policy, the present production run is aborted and will be restarted only when all on-hand inventories are depleted. Mathematical modeling is used. Derivations of production- inventory cost functions and proofs of theorems and proposition are presented, with the objective of determination of the optimal replenishment run time and lot size that minimize the expected costs per unit time. An illustrating example is provided to show its practical usage. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

84863338736	Solving finite production rate model with scrap and multiple shipments using algebraic approach	This paper solves a finite production rate (FPR) model with scrap and multiple shipments using an algebraic method. Classic FPR model assumes a continuous inventory issuing policy to satisfy demand and perfect quality production for all items produced. However, in real life vendor-buyer integrated production-inventory system, multiple shipment policy is practically used in lieu of a continuous issuing policy and generation of defective items during production run is inevitable. In this study, it is assumed that all defective items are scrap and the perfect quality items can only be delivered to customers if the whole lot is quality assured at the end of the production run. A conventional approach for solving the FPR model is the use of differential calculus on the long-run average cost function with the need to prove optimality first. This paper demonstrates that optimal lot size and its overall costs for the aforementioned FPR model can be derived without derivatives. As a result, it enables students or practitioners who have little knowledge of calculus to understand and to handle with ease the real-life FPR model.

However, in real life vendor-buyer integrated production-inventory system, multi-delivery policy is used practically in lieu of the continuous issuing policy and generation of defective items during production run is inevitable.

84864935098	Automated industrial inspection of light-emitting diodes using computer vision	Inspection of surface defects has become a critical task for manufacturers who strive to improve product quality and production efficiency. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used in modern electronic devices but surface defects in the epoxy encapsidations of LEDs often impair their appearances and functions. This paper aims to automatically inspect surface defects in LED encapsidations. We apply grey relational analysis to the frequency components in discrete cosine transform domain, and select the large-magnitude frequency components that represent the background texture of the surface. Then, we decline every frequency components based on their corresponding grey relational grades, and eliminate not only random texture but also uneven illumination patterns and retain anomalies in the restored image. The proposed method overcomes the difficulties of inspecting surface defects on uneven illumination images of LEDs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively inspect visual defects out on the surfaces of LEDs.

84866784699	Replenishment decision making with permissible shortage, repairable nonconforming products and random equipment failure	This study is concerned with replenishment decision making with repairable nonconforming products, backordering and random equipment failure during production uptime. In real world manufacturing systems, due to different factors generation of nonconforming items and unexpected machine breakdown are inevitable. Also, in certain business environments various situations between vendor and buyer, the backordering of shortage stocks sometimes is permissible with extra cost involved. This study incorporates backlogging, random breakdown and rework into a production system, with the objective of determination of the optimal replenishment lot size and optimal level of backordering that minimizes the long-run average system costs. Mathematical modeling along with the renewal reward theorem is employed for deriving system cost function. Hessian matrix equations are used to prove its convexity.

84867537575	Determining production run time with random defective rate and stochastic breakdown	This study derives the optimal run time for a production system with random defective rate and Poisson breakdown. In a real-life manufacturing system, generation of defective items and machine failures are inevitable. With the purpose of addressing these practical issues, this study examines a production system that has random defective items produced, and it also is subject to an equipment failure that may take place randomly. An abort/resume inventory control policy is adopted when breakdown occurs. Under such a policy, the malfunction machine is under repair immediately and the interrupted lot will be resumed right after restoration of the machine. Mathematical modeling and analyses, along with a recursive searching algorithm are used and proposed in this paper for deriving the optimal replenishment run time that minimizes the long-run average cost for such a practical production system. An example is provided to demonstrate how the proposed solution procedure works as well as its application.

84867553374	Replenishment lot sizing with a cost reduction delivery policy and failure in rework	This paper considers optimization of a replenishment lot size problem with a cost reduction delivery policy and failure in rework. A prior work by Chiu et al. studied an economic lot size problem with multiple shipments and rework. With the intention of cutting down producer's inventory holding cost, this paper proposes an alternative distribution policy to improve solution in Chiu et al. An n+1 delivery policy is suggested here in lieu of their n multi-delivery plan. Under such a policy, one additional installment of finished products is delivered during uptime for satisfying customer's demand during production uptime and rework time. Then, in the end of rework, fixed quantity n installments of finished items are delivered to customer at a fixed interval of time. Failure in rework is also practically assumed in this study. Mathematical modeling and optimization techniques are employed and as result the optimal production lot size solution is derived. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate practical usage of research result and its significant savings in producer's stock holding cost.

84871373290	Effect of variable shipping frequency on production-distribution policy in a vendor-buyer integrated system	This paper investigates the effect of variable shipping frequency on production-distribution policy in a vendor-buyer integrated system. In a recent article Chiu et al. [1] derived the optimal replenishment lot size for an economic production quantity problem with multi-delivery and quality assurance, based on an assumption that the number of shipment is a given constant. However, in a vendor-buyer integrated system in supply chain environment, joint determination of replenishment lot size and number of shipments may help such a system to gain significant competitive advantage in terms of becoming a low-cost producer as well as having tight linkage to customer. For this reason, the present study extends the work of Chiu et al. [1] by considering shipping frequency as one of the decision variables and incorporating customer's stock holding cost into system cost analysis. Hessian matrix equations are employed to certify the convexity of cost function that contains two decision variables, and the effect of variable shipping frequency on production-distribution policy is investigated. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate practical usage of the research result.

A straightforward approach in terms of a two-phase algebraic derivation is proposed in this study to replace the conventional method with the need of applying first-order and second-order differentiations to the system cost function for proof of convexity before derivation of the optimal production-shipment policy. The research result of this study is confirmed that is identical to what was obtained by Cheng et al. [1] where they used the conventional method to solve the same problem. The proposed approach is helpful for practitioners, who may not have sufficient knowledge of differential calculus to understand such an integrated production-shipment system in supply chain environment.

84873174065	Intra-supply chain system with multiple sales locations and quality assurance	The emergence of the global economy has transformed the interdepartmental nature of a transnational enterprise into a highly collaborative oriented team. This transformation enables the enterprise to lower its transaction and coordination costs and increase its competitive advantage in the global market. This study investigates such a so-called intra-supply chain system that exists in present-day transnational firms, wherein a single production unit manufactures products to meet the demands of multiple regional sales offices and incorporates quality assurance in its production. The objective of the present study is to determine an optimal production quantity and shipment policy that minimizes the integrated production-inventory-delivery costs for the intra-supply chain system. In this study, considerations related to a product's quality assurance include inspection for quality, rework of defective items and failure in rework. Delivery of the finished products starts when quality of the entire production lot is assured. Multi-shipment policy is used to synchronously transport finished items to multiple locations for satisfying customer demands in each cycle. Mathematical modeling along with Hessian matrix equations is employed to solve the proposed intra-supply chain system. A numerical example with a discussion and cost-benefit analysis of outsourcing work to an external distributor is presented to demonstrate the practical applicability of the obtained results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84874695842	Solving a multi-item finite production rate model with scrap and multi-shipment policy without derivatives	In real life manufacturing environments, production managers often make plan to produce m products in turn on a single machine in order to maximize the machine utilization. This study focuses on determining an optimal common production cycle time for a multi-item Finite Production Rate (FPR) model with random scrap rate and multi-shipment plan without using the derivatives. We assume that m products are manufactured in turn based on a common cycle policy on a single machine and during the processes some nonconforming items are generated randomly. These defective items cannot be reworked, thus they are scrapped at additional costs in the end of each production cycle. After the entire lot is quality assured, the delivery of finished items is under a practical multiple shipments plan. The objective is to determine an optimal common cycle time that minimizes the long-run average cost per unit time using an algebraic approach. Conventional method for solving such a problem is by the use of differential calculus on system cost function to derive the optimal policy, whereas the proposed approach is a straightforward method. It helps practitioners, who may not have sufficient knowledge of calculus, to understand and manage the real-life multi-item production systems more effectively. © 2013 Maxwell Scientific Organization.

In real life manufacturing environments, managements often plan to produce multiple products in turn on a single machine in order to maximize machine utilization. Also, dealing with random defective items during production seems to be an inevitable task, and the multi-delivery policy is commonly adopted to distribute the finished products to buyers. The objective of this study is to determine the optimal common production cycle that minimizes the total production-inventory-delivery costs per unit time for a multi-item production system with failure in rework and multi-delivery policy.

The classic EPQ model considers production planning for a single product with a perfect production process and continuous inventory issuing policy for its finished goods. However, in real vendor-buyer integrated systems, the multi-delivery policy is often used in lieu of the continuous issuing policy, and due to various uncontrollable factors, the generation of defective items is inevitable. Furthermore, in order to maximize machine utilization, management often plans the production of m products in turn on a single machine, rather than a single product on one machine, as assumed by the EPQ model. Therefore, by assuming that all defective items produced are scrap, this study aims to jointly determine the optimal rotation cycle time and number of shipments that minimize the long-run average cost for such an imperfect quality multi-item EPQ model. We employ mathematical modeling with the renewal reward theorem and obtain closed-form optimal operating policies for the proposed model. Further, we demonstrate the practical use of the results by using a numerical example and sensitivity analysis. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Determining the optimal run time for EPQ model with scrap, rework, and stochastic breakdowns. European Journal of Operational Research 180, 664-676], the perfect rework of nonconforming items was assumed in a production system that is subject to stochastic breakdown and random defective rate. However, in most real-life manufacturing systems emphasizing on quality assurance, the perfect rework of nonconforming products may not always be possible as a result of various factors. Therefore, in order to enhance the practical usages of their research outcome, this paper incorporates failure in rework factor into Chiu et al.'s model, derives the optimal replenishment run time for the amended model, and investigates the effect of the failure in rework on the optimal operating policy through this exact model. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the work of Chiu et al. (2013a) by incorporating an improved n + 1 multi-delivery plan into their model with an aim at reducing vendor's inventory holding cost. Under such a specific shipment policy, for each product an extra delivery of finished goods is made during production uptime to satisfy the product demand for the period of vendor's uptime.

The classical PSD provides essential information for the consequent material requirement planning (MRP). Such information includes the parent-child relationship between the end item and its components at each level, the number of components required at the child level in order to produce one unit at the parent level, and the number of periods required for production of each component. Selecting an appropriate acquisition method (either manufacturing process or speed of assembly or specific supplier) for each component is one of the early tasks faced by a product/process design team and it is critical because that the resulting decisions are then translated into the PSD and its subsequent material requirement planning. In this study, we propose a step-by-step decision procedure using the CPM and time-costing method for determining the optimal component procuring alternatives when expediting end product's completion time is desired.
