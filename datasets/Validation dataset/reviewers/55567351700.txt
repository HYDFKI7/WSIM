84927594742	Inhibition of inflammation mediates the protective effect of atorvastatin reload in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac emergency surgery	Objectives This study aimed to (a) investigate whether atorvastatin reload protects against acute heart failure (AHF) in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac emergency surgery and decreases the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during hospitalization and (b) elucidate its possible mechanism of action. Materials and methods: In total, 500 patients with stable CAD before noncardiac emergency surgery were randomized either to the atorvastatin reload or to the placebo group. All patients received atorvastatin treatment postoperatively. The primary end point was the incidence of AHF during hospitalization, and the secondary end point was the incidence of MACE during hospitalization. Preoperative and 72 h postoperative changes in highsensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were compared between the two groups. Results: AHF during hospitalization occurred in 5.2% of patients in the atorvastatin reload group and 11.2% in the placebo group (P= 0.0225). MACE during hospitalization occurred in 2.4% of patients in the atorvastatin reload group and 8.0% in the placebo group (P= 0.0088). According to multivariable analysis, atorvastatin reload conferred a 50% reduction in the risk of AHF during hospitalization (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8; P= 0.005). The median decrease in the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels was significantly greater in the atorvastatin reload group (P <0.001). Conclusion: Atorvastatin reload may improve the clinical outcome of patients with stable CAD undergoing noncardiac emergency surgery by decreasing the incidence of AHF and MACE during hospitalization. The mechanism of this protective effect may involve inhibition of inflammation.

84940330903	TNF-α induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition through NF-κB in hepatocellular carcinoma	Objective To investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and the related mechanism. Methods HCC cell lines Hep3B and SMMC-7721 were treated with TNF-α for 24 h; then the cell morphological changes were observed by microscope and the expressions of the epithelial markers (E- cadherin and β-catenin), mesenchymal markers (Vimentin and N-cadherin), and EMT associated transcriptional factor Twist were examined by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. The invasion and metastasis ability was evaluated by Transwell and wound healing assay. Luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence were used to determine NF-κB transcriptional activity; Western blotting analysis was used to examine the expression levels of IκBα and p-IκBα protien. Cells was also incubated with TNF-α and NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082) together, and then the phenotypeof EMT was detected by microscope, RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Results Hep3B and SMMC-7721 cells had EMT phenotype after treated with TNF-α. Wound healing assay showed that the wound healing rate of cells exposed to TNF-α was significantly increased compared with the non-treated group (P<0. 05), and Transwell assay showed that more cells penetrating the membrane after treatment with TNF-α (P < 0. 05). TNF-α effectively promoted IκBα phosphorylation and the subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation We also found that TNF-α-mediated EMT could be converted by NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082) (P<0. 05). Conclusion TNF-α induces EMT of HCC cells through NF-κB-dependent pathways, and subsequently promotes the invasion and metastasis of HCC.

84940299523	Effect of hepatic stellate cell condition medium on chemo-resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma PLC/PRF/5 cells and its mechanism	Objective: To explore the effect of the hepatic stellate cell condition medium (HSC-CM) on chemo-resistance of human hepatocellular carcinoma PLC/PRF/5 cells and its possible mechanism. Methods: Hepatic stellate cell line LX-2 was incubated and activated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and then this condition medium was collected, named HSC-CM. PLC/PRF/5 cells were incubated in HSC-CM for 24 h. After the treatment of cisplatin for 12 or 24 h, the apoptosis of PLC/PRF/5 cells was identified by flow cytometry, the cell proliferation of PLC/PRF/5 cells was detected by MTT assay, and the expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated genes in PLC/PRF/5 cells was detected by real-time PCR. Results: The apoptosis rates of PLC/PRF/5 cells in the cisplatin group were (22. 34 ± 1. 12)% and (26. 78 ±1. 56)%; those in the HSC-CM + cisplatin group were (17. 22 ± 1. 42)% and (21. 52 ± 1. 76)% at 12 and 24 h time points, which showed that the apoptosis rates of the cisplatin group were higher than of the HSC-CM + cisplatin group (P <0. 05). The proliferation of PLC/PRF/5 cells in the cisplatin group and HSC-CM + cisplatin group at these two time points were (68. 65 ± 2. 56)% and (79. 47 ± 1. 43)%, (46. 54 ± 3. 65)% and (62. 77 ± 2. 89) % respectively, showing a stronger proliferation activity of PLC/PRF/5 cells from the HSC-CM + cisplatin group. Real-time PCR results indicated that compared with the cisplatin group, the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in PLC/PRF/5 cells from the HSC-CM + cisplatin group was decreased (P < 0. 05), and the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin) and EMT-associated transcription factor (Snail, ZEB1) expressions were significantly up-regulated (P<0.01). Conclusion: HSC-CM may promote the rchemo-resistance of PLC/PRF/5 cells through inducing EMT of PLC/PRF/5 cells.

84940313426	Expression of cyclin D1, p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, p53 and Ki-67 in hepatocellular carcinoma: A pathological study	Objective To explore the expression of cyclin D1, p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, p53 and Ki-67 protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its relationship with prognosis of HCC patients. Methods Liver specimens were collected from 80 HCC patients who received hepatectomy in the General Hospital of PLA from Jan. 2000 to Jan. 2005, and the expressions of cyclin D1, p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, p53 and Ki-67 protein were determined by immunohistochemical staining (EliVision method) to investigate the relationship between the protein expressions and the clinicopathologic characteristics of HCC, and their relationship with the survival rate of the patients was analyzed. Results The positive expression rates of cyclin D1, p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, p53 and Ki-67 in HCC were 38.8%, 40.5%, 65.4% and 80.0% respectively, and they were significantly higher than those in matched normal tissues (19.0%, 11.5%, 0.0% and 6.3% respectively, P< 0.005). Correlation analysis showed that the expression of cyclin D1 was positively related to the nuclear grade (P=0.041), the expression of p21<sup>WAF1</sup> and p53 were positively related to the tumor differentiation (P=0.032, P=0.031) and vascular invasion (P=0.036, P=0.011), the expression of Ki-67 was positively related to the tumor differentiation (P=0.004), nuclear grade (P=0.045) and vascular invasion (P=0.001). Survival analysis showed the prognosis was poor in patients with high expression of cyclin D1 or/and Ki-67. The expression of Ki-67 was significantly related to the expression of p53 (P=0.000) and p21<sup>WAF1</sup> (P=0.047), but no significant relation was found among the expression of other proteins. Cox regression analysis showed that the tumor size (P=0.042), tumor number (P=0.004) and vascular invasion (P=0.000) were independent prognostic factors of HCC. Conclusions The cyclin D1, p21<sup>WAF1</sup>, p53 and Ki-67 protein may be involved in the biological process of HCC. The positive xpression of cyclin D1 and Ki- 67 may be used to evaluate the prognosis of patients with HCC.

1542686179	Differences in coronary microvascular lesions in coronary heart disease and hypertension: An autopsy study of elderly patients	Background. In the case of hypertension, lesions in the microvessels of the target organs precede and deteriorate futher after arteriosclerosis in the small arteries. Thus coronary microvascular lesion (CML) was considered the crucial factor contributing to damage to the target organs. The purpose of this study is to observe the characteristics and differences of CML in autopsies of elderly patients with essential hypertension (EHT), coronary heart disease (CHD), or EHT with CHD, given the same degree of left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT). Methods. A retrospective study was performed on 246 cases of patients over 60 years old with EHT, CHD, or EHT with CHD, and on 26 cases without cardiovascular disease as controls, out of a total of 3195 consecutive autopsied cases. The arterioles (with diameter 10 -60 μm) and the capillaries in the cardiac muscle layer were examined by haematoxylin and eosin staining, elastic van Gieson staining, and CD

31144452765	Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation of hepatic cavernous hemangioma: A preliminary experience with 27 patients	Background: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA), currently used extensively for liver tumors, also has been applied successfully to hepatic cavernous hemangioma (HCH) percutaneously. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of laparoscopic RFA for patients with HCHs. Methods: Between March 2001 and March 2004, 27 patients with symptomatic and rapid-growth lesions were treated by laparoscopic RFA using the RF-2000 generator system. The treatment-related complications were observed. All the patients were followed up with helical computed tomography scans and ultrasonography at regular intervals to assess the therapeutic efficacy of laparoscopic RFA. Results: This study assessed 9 men and 18 women with a mean age of 41.6 ± 8.3 years. Three additional intrahepatic lesions missed preoperatively were found in three patients on intraoperative ultrasound. A total of 27 patients with 50 liver lesions were treated successfully with laparoscopic RFA. The mean maximum tumor diameter was 5.5 ± 2.0 cm. The mean length of time for RFA per lesion was 20.7 ± 11.9 min, and the mean blood loss was 134.4 ± 88.9 ml. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed simultaneously for gallstones in 13 patients and for abutting of gallbladder from hemangioma in 2 patients. In addition, 3 patients also had a laparoscopic deroofing of simple hepatic cysts. Although postoperative low-grade fever and transient elevation of serum transaminase levels were observed in 13 patients, there were no complications related to laparoscopic RFA. During a median follow-up period of 21 months (range, 12-42 months), complete lesion necrosis was achieved for all the patients. Conclusions: Laparoscopic RFA therapy is a safe, feasible, and effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic and rapid-growth HCHs located on the surface of the liver or adjacent to the gallbladder. Intraoperative ultrasonography is a useful adjunct for detecting additional liver lesions and offering more accurate targeting for RFA. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.

33645103580	Relationship between oxidized lipoprotein, angiogenesis and human coronary atherosclerotic plaque stabilization	Objectives: To analyze the relationship between oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), angiogenesis and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques in human coronary arteries; and to investigate the role of oxLDL in creating vulnerable sites in atherosclerotic plaques. Methods: Samples of coronary arteries were obtained at autopsies of 42 patients with acute coronary syndrome. Eighty randomly selected blocks were studied by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against oxLDL and endothelial cells (factor VIII). Computer-aided planimeter was used for quantitative analysis. Results: In unstable plaques, percentage of immunoreactive areas for oxLDL was significantly higher than that in stable plaques. Most of the oxLDL were located in shoulder region of these plaques, as compared to the fibrous cap and basal regions. The details of distribution of oxLDL were as follows; shoulder region (20.43 ± 3.12 for unstable plaques and 17.65 ± 4.22 for stable plaques), fibrous cap (4. 77 ± 2.03 for unstable plaque and 2.80 ± 0.22 for stable plaques) and basal region (5.65 ± 1.65 for unstable plaques and 3.22 ± 1.02 for unstable plaques). OxLDL was also a main component in the lipid core. In the shoulder region, there was a significant positive correlation between neovascularization and oxLDL (r = 0. 8247, P = 0.000). Conclusions: The amount of oxLDL is significantly higher in unstable atherosclerotic plaques, especially over the shoulder region. OxLDL in coronary atherosclerotic plaques is thus an important factor in determining stabilization of the plaques. OxLDL may induce influx of inflammatory cells which subsequently leads to decreased plaque stabilization.

33846445631	Correlation between coronary and peripheral atherosclerosis in elder autopsy cases	Aim: To detect the pathological lesions in femoral, carotid, and anterior descending branch of the left coronary, and investigate the relation of atherosclerosis (ATS) lesions between peripheral arteries and coronary in the elder autopsy patients. Methods: Totally 15 autopsy cases including 13 males and 2 females, mean age of (84.9 ±8.9) years were selected successively from the Department of Pathology, Chinese PLA General Hospital from April to November 2003. Inclusive criterion: 1 aged over 70 years; 2 one of the cases with coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular disease, peripheral ATS and hypertensive disease (HD). Exclusive criterion: with the history of thromboangiitis obliterans, artery endoprothesis implantation or tutor. The relatives all agreed and signed the consent before autopsy. There were 10 CAD cases, 9 HD cases, 6 cases of cerebral infarction, and 2 cases of ATS in lower limbs. Serial sections from three kinds of arteries including femoral, carotid, and anterior descending branch of the left coronary were examined microscopically. The ATS sections were divided into fatty streak, fibrous plaque, atheromatous plaque and combined lesion according to the pathologic diagnosis. Referring to the peripheral ATS score of ultrasound, three ATS lesions in every case was graded as 0 point (no ATS), 1 point (fatty streak), 2 points (fibrous plaque and atheromatous plaque) and 3 points (combined lesion). Degree of ATS= ∑ (score of lesion × number of segment). The range of ATS was calculated with the number of affected segments, and then the grades of the degree and range of ATS were evaluated in each case. Results: 1 The detection rates of femoral (left, right), carotid (left, right) and anterior descending branch of the left coronary were 11/73%, 14/93%, 12/80%, 12/80%, 14/93%; The detection rates of plaque were 10/ 67%, 14/93%, 12/80%, 11/73%, 14/93%, respectively. 2 In the degree and range of ATS lesions, the correlation coefficient was 0.47 and 0.41 respectively to femoral and anterior descending branch of the left coronary; -0.01 and -0.06 respectively to femoral and carotid arteries; 0.49 and 0.37 respectively to carotid and anterior descending branch of the left coronary (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The correlation is absent among femoral, carotid, and anterior descending branch of the left coronary either in the degree or range of ATS lesions. To the same case, it seems that femoral and carotid ATS can not be used to evaluate the degree and range of coronary ATS.

33846631293	Morphologic diagnosis and clinical significance of prostatic atypical small acinar proliferation suspicious but not diagnostic of cancer	Objective: To study the morphologic features and clinical significance of atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) suspicious but not diagnostic of cancer in prostatic biopsies. Methods: The slides of 11 cases of prostatic needle biopsies collected during a two-year period with the diagnosis of ASAP were reviewed. Immunohistochemical study for 34βE12, p63 and P504S was performed on the archival paraffin sections. Results: All the 11 ASAP cases were characterized by the presence of a few compacted small acini in the prostatic stroma. Six cases had acini of less than three in number. The acini were round or slightly irregular in shape. The nuclei were enlarged, round or irregular, arranged in single layer and focally separated by broad interval. The nucleoli were usually prominent. Cytoplasm was amphophilic or pale and the lumen border was often well-defined. Basophilic mucus was also seen in some of the lumen. Immunohistochemical study for 34βE12 and p63 was negative, while that for P504S was positive. In 4 of the 11 cases, the acini were more than three in number, round or slightly irregular, but without cytologic atypia. The nuclei were slightly enlarged with small or inconspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemical study for 34βE12 and p63 was negative or at most focally positive. P504S staining was either negative or weakly positive. Second repeat biopsy was carried out in all cases, and 4 of them (36%) showed definite adenocarcinomatous changes. The positive cases were those with fewer acini but definite cytologic atypia in the initial biopsy. Conclusions: ASAP is a morphologic interpretation closely associated with prostatic adenocarcinoma. The histologic features are suspicious of but not diagnostic of cancer, due to insufficient criteria in terms of acinar number, cytologic or architectural abnormalities. The positive rate in subsequent repeat biopsy is higher than that for cases with usual nodular hyperplasia.

34548511109	Histologic classification and prognostic implication of pseudomyxoma peritonei	Objective: To clarify the various diagnostic connotations of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) and to study their prognostic implications. Methods: Clinicopathologic features and follow-up data of 40 patients with PMP diagnosed in The General Hospital of PLA were retrospectively reviewed. The cases were histologically classified into 3 subcategories: disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), and PMCA with intermediate or discordant features (PMCA-I/D). The survival rate was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method and the difference was statistically analyzed. Results: Twelve of the 40 patients died on follow up. The duration of survival ranged from 2 to 348 months (medium = 37.5 months). In general, the 3-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 79.0%, 69.4% and 53.0%, respectively. The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 50.3 years (age range = 22 to 76 years). The male-to-female ratio was 1:1. The age and sex of patients, frequency of operation and presence of ovarian involvement did not correlate with duration of survival. On the other hand, the presence of appendiceal tumor, parenchymal invasion of abdominal viscera, cellularity, architecture, nuclear atypia and mitotic activity of the peritoneal lesion significantly correlated with survival. There was also significant difference in survival between DPAM, PMCA-I/D and PMCA subcategories (P = 0.018). The difference in survival rate between PMCA-I/D and PMCA subgroups however was not statistically significant (P = 0.096). The outcome of DPAM was significantly better when compared with the combined group of PMCA-I/D and PMCA (P = 0.006). Conclusions: In general, the 10-year survival rate of PMP was low, despite the relatively benign-looking or low-grade pathologic appearance. Peritoneal lesions with higher cellularity, conspicuous nuclear atypia and higher mitotic activity are associated with a lower survival rate. The prognosis was even worse in the presence of appendiceal carcinoma or parenchymal invasion of abdominal viscera. It is thus advisable to subclassify PMP into DPAM, PMCA and PMCA-I/D, due to the difference in prognostic implication.

79951958851	CpG island methylator phenotype of cell-cycle regulators associated with TNM stage and poor prognosis in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma	Aims: CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) involves the targeting of multiple genes by promoter hypermethylation, and the cell-cycle regulatory proteins often change in human neoplasms. To gain insight into the role of epigenetic aberration of cell-cycle regulator genes in oesophagus squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the authors determined the hypermethylation profile in ESCC. Methods: The promoter methylation status of nine cell-cycle regulator genes was examined in 50 ESCC, 50 dysplastic tissues and 50 normal epithelial tissues by methylation-specific PCR. Results: The frequency of promoter methylation was 52% for p14, 44% for p15, 50% for p16, 56% for p21, 38% for p27, 8% for p53, 42% for p57, 36% for p73, and 44% for RB1 of 50 ESCC. CIMP+ was detected in 54% (27/50) of ESCC and 8% (4/50) of dysplastic tissues; no CIMP+ was present in normal epithelial tissues (p<0.001). The results show that promoter methylation of p14, p15, p16, p21, p27, p57 and p73 was far more common in ESCC samples with CIMP+ than those with CIMP-. A significant difference between CIMP status and TNM stage and metastasis was found in ESCC (p<0.05). Patients with ESCC with CIMP+ had poorer 4-year survival than those with CIMP-. Conclusions: The results suggest that CIMP of a subset of cell-cycle regulatory genes has an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of ESCC.

79952709160	Prognostic significance of mast cell count following curative resection for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	Background: Recently, there is evidence that the number of mast cells in various solid cancers increases with tumor progression. The role of mast cells in promoting tumor progression, however, has not been well studied in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of mast cell counts in different zones of the neoplasm in patients with PDAC after curative resection. Methods: Numbers of mast cells and microvessels were assessed by immunohistochemistry in tissues from 103 patients with PDAC and 10 patients with normal pancreas. All patients with PDAC underwent partial pancreatic resection. The investigators paid particular attention to the distribution of mast cells in each specimen. Results: High mast cell counts in the intratumoral border zone correlated with the presence of lymphatic and microvascular invasion, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage, and were an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P < .001). In contrast, neither in the intratumoral center zone nor in the peritumoral zones was mast cell count associated with OS. Mast cell counts in the intratumoral border zone, but not in the peritumoral or in the intratumoral center zone, were correlated with microvessel counts. Conclusion: The present study shows a zone-specific distribution of mast cells in PDAC and highlights the importance of invasive front in the prognosis of patients with PDAC after curative resection. Zone-specific evaluation of mast cell and microvessel counts may be helpful for prognostic assessment and therapeutic decision making in PDAC. © 2011 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

80052550932	Histological origin of pseudomyxoma peritonei in Chinese women: Clinicopathology and immunohistochemistry	AIM: To investigate the histological origin of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) in Chinese women. METHODS: The clinical and pathological data were reviewed for 35 women with PMP, and specimens of the peritoneal, appendiceal and ovarian lesions of each patient were examined using the PV-6000 immunohistochemistry method. Antibodies included cytokeratin (CK)7,CK20, mucin (MUC)-1, MUC-2, carbohydrate antigen(CA)-125, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor(PR).RESULTS: Abundant colloidal mucinous tumors were observed in the peritoneum in all 35 cases. Thirty-one patients had a history of appendectomy, 28 of whom had mucinous lesions. There was one patient with appendicitis, one whose appendix showed no apparentpathological changes, and one with unknown surgical pathology. Ovarian mucinous tumors were found in 24patients. The tumors were bilateral in 13 patients, on the right-side in nine, and on the left side in two. Twenty patients had combined appendiceal and ovarian lesions; 16of whom had undergone initial surgery for appendiceal lesions. Four patients had undergone initial surgery for ovarian lesions, and relapse occurred in these patientsat 1, 11, 32 and 85 mo after initial surgery. Appendiceal mucinous tumors were found in each of these four patients. Thirty-three of the 35 patients showed peritoneal lesions that were positive for CK20 and MUC-2,but negative for CK7, MUC-1, CA125, ER and PR. The expression patterns in the appendix and the ovary were similar to those of the peritoneal lesions. In one of there maining two cases, CK20, CK7 and MUC-2 were positive, and MUC-1, CA125, ER and PR were negative. The ovaries were not resected. The appendix of one patient was removed at another hospital, and no specimen was evaluated. In the other case, the appendix appeared tobe normal during surgery, and was not resected. Peritoneal and ovarian lesions were negative for CK20, MUC-2,CK7, MUC-1, CA125, ER and PR.CONCLUSION: Most PMP originated from the appendix. Among women with PMP, the ovarian tumors were implanted rather than primary. For patients with PMP, appendectomy should be performed routinely. The ovaries, especially the right ovaries should be explored. © 2011 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84861747490	Anti-tumor effect of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine by inhibiting telomerase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cells	AIM: To investigate the effect of the demethylating reagent 5-aza-2′-deoxycitidine (DAC) on telomerase activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, SMMC-7721 and HepG2. METHODS: The related gene expression in cell lines was examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analysis. The telomerase activity was examined by telomeric repeat amplification protocol-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and DNA methylation was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The telomerase activity was significantly reduced in both cell lines treated with DAC, accompanied by downregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). We also observed the effect of DAC on the methylation status of hTERT promoter and the expression of regulatory genes, such as c-myc, p15, p16, p21, E2F1, and WT1. The methylation status of hTERT promoter could be reversed in SMMC-7721 by DAC, but not in HepG2 cells. However, p16 expression could be reactivated by demethylation of its promoter, and c-Myc expression was repressed in both cell lines. Moreover, DAC could enhance the sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, by induction of apoptosis of HCC cells. CONCLUSION: The DAC exerts its anti-tumor effects in HCC cells by inhibiting the telomerase activity. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84866550720	Pathologie diagnosis and differential diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of kidney	Objective To study the clinicopathologic features and histologic differential diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SmCC) of kidney. Methods The clinicopathologic features of 12 cases of SmCC of kidney encountered during the period from 1999 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Results Six cases of primary and 6 cases of metastatic SmCC involving kidney were identified. Amongst the primary renal SmCC, 2 were located in renal parenchyma and 4 in renal pelvis. Chest X-ray showed negative findings. Five of them underwent radical nephrectomy. On gross examination, the tumor was located centrally around the renal pelvis in 4 cases and peripherally in renal parenchyma in 1 case. On the other hand, 4 of the 6 cases of metastatic SmCC were discovered during therapy for pulmonary SmCC. Two of these patients presented with abdominal pain and gross hematuria, with lung and renal tumor masses identified simultaneously. The diagnosis of all the 6 cases of metastatic SmCC was confirmed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. Microscopically, pure SmCC was demonstrated in the 2 cases of primary renal parenchymal SmCC and 6 cases of metastatic SmCC. The 4 primary renal pelvic SmCC coexisted with urothelial carcinoma component. On immunohistochemical study, all cases were positive for cytokeratin, synaptophysin and CD56. All metastatic cases and 4 primary cases were also positive for TTF-I. Of six patients with primary SmCC two died 4 and 9 months after operation, and two were alive with a follow-up of 25 and 138 months, respectively. Five of six cases with metastatic SmCC died 3-8 months after diagnosis. The other 3 cases were failed to follow-up. Conclusions Both primary and metastatic SmCC can be found in the kidney. Although rare, primary SmCC is located either in renal parenchyma or in pelvis. The diagnosis of SmCC relies on morphologic examination and immunohistochemical study. TTF-I immunostaining cannot reliably distinguish primary from metastatic SmCC in kidney. Correlation with clinicoradiologic findings and demonstration of coexisting urothelial carcinoma component (if any) is helpful in delineation of the tumor origin.

84887445881	Autophagy prevents irradiation injury and maintains stemness through decreasing ROS generation in mesenchymal stem cells	Stem cells were characterized by their stemness: self-renewal and pluripotency. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a unique type of adult stem cells that have been proven to be involved in tissue repair, immunoloregulation and tumorigenesis. Irradiation is a well-known factor that leads to functional obstacle in stem cells. However, the mechanism of stemness maintenance in human MSCs exposed to irradiation remains unknown. We demonstrated that irradiation could induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation that resulted in DNA damage and stemness injury in MSCs. Autophagy induced by starvation or rapamycin can reduce ROS accumulation-associated DNA damage and maintain stemness in MSCs. Further, inhibition of autophagy leads to augment of ROS accumulation and DNA damage, which results in the loss of stemness in MSCs. Our results indicate that autophagy may have an important role in protecting stemness of MSCs from irradiation injury. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

84897542316	HIF-1 alpha overexpression correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival in gastric cancer patients post-gastrectomy	Background: Overall, gastric cancer prognosis remains poor. Detailed characterization of molecular markers that govern gastric cancer pathogenesis is warranted to establish innovative therapeutic options. HIF-1α overexpression has been linked to poor gastric cancer prognosis. However, though researched for years, the prognostic role of HIF-1α in gastric cancer is still controversial. Hence, the objective of the present study was to analyze the prognostic values of HIF-1α, TGF-β, VEGF and pERK1/2 in gastric cancer patients following gastrectomy. Methods: This study included 446 patients with confirmed gastric cancer who underwent gastrectomy in a single Chinese Cancer Center between 2005 and 2006. Clinicopathologic features, as well as immunohistochemical analysis of TGF-β, HIF-1α, VEGF and pERK1/2 were determined. Long-term survival of these patients was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: HIF-1α overexpression was more frequent in patients with hepatic metastases (71.6% versus 43.0% in those without hepatic metastases, P = 0.000, χ

Chemotherapy remains a major treatment alternatively to surgery for a large number of patients at the advanced stage of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of PADI4 in the chemoresistance of HCC has not been identified.Methods: MTT and PI/Annexin V assay were employed to examine the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cell lines. The expression of MDR1 is detected by Realtime PCR. GFP tagged LC3 expression vector and electron microscopy are utilized to demonstrate the occurrence of autophagy.Results: We observed that the elevated PADI4 expression is associated with chemoresistance in HCC patients with TACE after surgery. In addition, we found that overexpression of PADI4 in HCC cell lines lead to the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the HCC cells that overexpressed PADI4 were observed to undergo autophagy which was known as a protective mechanism for cells to resist the cell tosicity from chemotherapy. Autophagy inhibitor could effectively restore the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo.Conclusions: These results indicate that PADI4 may induce chemoresistance in HCC cells by leading autophagy.

43049120687	Expression of cyclin G1 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinicopathologic significance	Objective: To evaluate the expression of cyclin G1 and its relationship with clinical pathological characters, p53 expression and microvessel density (MVD) in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and to investigate the prognostic value of cyclin G1 in LSCC. Methods: Using immunohistochemistry, 81 cases of LSCC were evaluated for cyclin G1 and p52 expression, MVD was assessed by CD34 staining. In 20 cases, similar assessment was made in the adjacent normal mucosa. Results: Compared to the normal laryngeal mucosa, the expressions of cyclin G1, p53 and MVD were higher in LSCC than that in normal tissues. The positive rates of cyclin G1 and p53 expressions in LSCC were 61.7% (50/81) and 65.4% (53/81), respectively. The positive rates of cyclin G1 in LSCC with or without p53 expression were 71.7% (38/53) and 42.9% (12/28), respectively. The expression of cyclin G1 was significantly correlated with p53 (P = 0.011). The mean value of MVD was (51.23 ± 16.46 mv) in cyclin G1 positive group, and (30.74 ± 12.29 mv) in the negative group, and the difference was significant (P = 0.005). Furthermore, the over-expression of cyclin G1 was related to the histological grade, cervical lymph node metastases and 5 year survival (P = 0.002, 0.013 and 0.032 respectively). Conclusions: Cyclin G1 is highly expressed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and is associated with the expression of p53 protein and tumor angiogenesis. It may play an important role in carcinogenesis and metastasis in LSCC, and may be one of prognostic indices for LSCC patients.

41849096743	Clinicopathologic significance of chromosome 17 polysemy in breast cancer	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological significance of chromosome 17 polysomy in breast cancer. Methods: Retrospective study of 200 cases of breast cancer including 106 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma and 94 cases of in-situ carcinoma was performed by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to explore the relationship between chromosome 17 polysomy and age, nuclear atypia, lymphatic metastasis, HER2 gene amplification and HER2 protein expression. Results: Twenty-six percent (52/200) of chromosome 17 polysomy was detected in 200 cases of breast ductal carcinoma, all of which were invasive ductal carcinoma. Overall 52.8% (52/180) of invasive ductal carcinoma cases showed chromosome 17 polysomy, which was correlated to HER2 gene amplification (P = 0.000) and HER-2 protein expression (P = 0.000), and to HER2 expression combined with HER2 gene amplification (P = 0.001). Chromosome 17 polysomy with or without HER2 gene amplification was also associated with high-grade nuclear atypia (P = 0.012 or P = 0.010) and lymphatic metastasis (P = 0.002 or P = 0.009). However, chromosome 17 polysomy with or without HER2 gene amplification was not correlative with the age of patients (P = 1.000 or P = 0.415). Conclusion: Chromosome 17 polysomy may be related to the nuclear atypia, metastasis, HER2 gene amplification of invasive ductal carcinoma and thus a worse prognosis of the patients.

43149089839	Clinical pathology of perineural invasion in hilar cholangiocarcinoma	AIM: To elucidate the characteristics and mechanism of perineural invasion in hilar cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: A clinicopathologic study was conducted on tissue sections from 73 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma to observe the incidence and modes of perineural invasion. Clinicopathologic factors, such as tumor differentiation and pathologic stage, were analyzed when perineural invasion was observed in the sections. Immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and D2-40 in cancer tissue samples was performed to clarify the association of perineural invasion with vessels. RESULTS: The overall incidence of perineural invasion was 91.78% (67 of 73 patients). However, the incidence of perineural invasion did not show any remarkable difference in various differentiated adenocarcinomas. Logistic regression analysis identified that penetration of bile duct was significantly correlated with perineural invasion (P < 0.01). The microvessel density (MVD) was significantly lower in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas than in moderately- and poorly- differentiated adenocarcinomas (P < 0.05). Five patterns were observed as the tumor cells invaded nerve fibers. Although tumor cells were found to invade microvessels and microlymphatics, immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and D2-40 respectively showed no association between perineural invasion and lymphatic or vascular invasion. CONCLUSION: Perineural invasion is common in hilar cholangiocarcinoma and does not develop via the lymphatic or vascular network, but is a continuous extension from the primary tumor. Nerve plexus around the membrana adventitia should be completely divested during radical excision of hilar cholangiocarcinoma.

55849089038	Study on expression of estrogen receptor isoforms in eutopic and ectopic endometrium of ovarian endometriosis	Objective: To investigate the distribution of ER isoforms in endometriosis and eutopic endometrium. Methods: Tissue samples of patients with ovarian endometriosis, treated in People's Liberation Army General Hospital from January 2004 to December 2006, were retrieved. A total of 60 cases of ovarian endometriotic cysts with their corresponding eutopic endometrium (30 cases of proliferation phase and 30 of secretary phase eutopic endometrium) and 30 cases of normal endometrium (15 proliferative and 15 secretary phase endometrial samples respectively) were included. Expressions of ERα and ERβ were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and the expression ratio was statistically analyzed by using SPSS 12.0 software. Results: Expressions of both ERα and ERβ in epithelial cells were positively correlated with that of the stromal cells. The expression of ERα in eutopic endometrium (73.3% in epithelium and 76.7% in stroma) was significantly higher than that in ovarian endometriotic cysts (43.3% in epithelium and 46.7% in stroma), or normal control (56.7% in epithelium and 50.0% in stroma, respectively, each P < 0.05. However, the expression of ERβ (90.0% in epithelium and 76.7% in stroma) was higher in ovarian endometriotic cysts than that in the eutopic endometrium (68.0% in epithelium and 63.3% in stroma respectively, P < 0.05), and ERβ expression in eutopic endometrium was higher than that in the normal control endometrium (36.7% in epithelium and 26.7% in stroma, respectively, P <0.05). The expressions of both ERα and ERβ changed periodically in eutopic and normal endometrium, whereas ERα and ERβ level were less variable in the ectopic endometrium. The expression of ERβ was statistically higher than that of ERα (P < 0.05) in ectopic endometrium, whereas no significant difference was seen between the two isoforms in the eutopic or normal endometrium. Conclusions Both ERα and ERβ have higher expression levels in eutopic endometrium of patients with ovarian endometriotic cysts. ERβ is predominantly expressed in endometriotic cysts, where the expression of ERα is limited. The different distribution of ERα and ERβ may play an important role in the development of ovarian endometriosis.

65449170725	MicroRNA-101 regulates expression of the v-fos FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been proposed as a versatile class of molecules involved in regulation of various biological processes. Although there is emerging evidence that some microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, the specific role of miRNA in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear at this point. In this study, we examined the microRNA expression profiles in a set of 20 human HCC specimens by miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that among the 20 HCC samples analyzed, microRNA-101 was significantly down-regulated twofold or more (twofold to 20-fold) in 16 samples compared with the matching nontumoral liver tissues. Using both a luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis, we showed that microRNA-101 repressed the expression of v-fos FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) oncogene, a key component of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor. Moreover, using a luciferase expression vector (pAP-1-Luc) driven by seven copies of an AP-1 cis-element, we observed that microRNA-101 expression inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced AP-1 activity. In in vitro Matrigel invasion and Transwell migration assays, enhanced microRNA-101 expression inhibited the invasion and migration of cultured HCC cells, respectively. These findings suggest that microRNA-101 may play an important role in HCC. Conclusion: MicroRNA-101, which is aberrantly expressed in HCC, could repress the expression of the FOS oncogene.

70349682946	Neurocutaneous melanosis: A case report and review of the literatures	Objective: To study the clinicopathological features of neurocutaneous melanosis (NCM) and to review related literatures. Methods: The clinicopathological and histomorphological features of a case with NCM were studied. HE staining and immunohistochemical staining were used respectively. Eleven cases of NCM reported in China were reviewed. Results: A 19-year-old man was admitted with headache for 5 d. Multiple cutaneous melanocyte nevi were seen on the surface of head, face, trunk and extremities in patients at birth. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed space occupying lesion with hemorrhage on the medial surface of left frontal lobe. During operation, small scattering black blotches on local arachnoid membrane, and 3 cm x 4 cm pale black lesion on the medial surface of left frontal lobe were found. Under microscopic observation, the tumor cells presented mosaic arrangement as pavement stone with many cytoplasm and pigments, the cells were multi-morphologic with obvious atypic nuclei, and large unusual tumor cells and tumor giant cells were infiltratively growing foward cerebrum parenchyma and perivascualr spaces associated with hemorrhage. Tumor cell presented positively for vimentin (Vim), S-100 protein (S-100) and human melanoma black 45 (HMB45), and Ki-67 antigen labeled index was less than 25%. The expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament (NF), neuron specific endase (NSE) and cellular keratin (CK) were negative. Conclusion: NCM is rarely seen in clinic. This phakomatosis syndrome is characterized by focal or diffuse proliferation of melanocyte in skin and leptomeninges. Cutaneous melanocytic nevus is usually benign, but melanocytes in leptomeninges are potentially malignant. The prognosis of NCM is poor. Nearly 50% patients with NCM will die within 3 years after appearance of neurological symptoms.

74749090903	Correlation of CpG island methylator phenotype with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma	CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), in which multiple genes are concurrently methylated, is an important mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma development. We determined a hypermethylation profile in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We examined the promoter methylation status of 10 genes in 60 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 cases of paired non-tumor tissues, and 6 cases of normal tissues by methylation-specific PCR. The average methylated gene numbers were significantly different between HCC and nontumor tissues (p < 0.001). We found metastasis, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage were significantly different among patients with different CIMP status. Patients with high frequency CIMP tumors had significantly worse survival than patients with intermediate frequency or no CIMP tumors (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Our results suggested that CIMP could serve as a molecular marker of late stage and poorly prognostic HCC development. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

75049085303	Primary choriocarcinoma of the liver: A clinicopathological study of five cases in males	Primary choriocarcinomas of the liver are rare. Previous reported cases were mostly in infants with only rare adult cases. Here, we presented five adult cases. The patients were all males, with an average age of 41.6 years (from 36 to 48 years). Clinical presentations included right upper abdominal pain or abdominal distension. All patients presented with a large hepatic mass on ultrasonography that measured 11 cm on average in the greatest diameter. Elevated serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels were noted in all cases. At presentation, the tumor was confined to the liver in two patients and therefore surgically resected. The other three patients presented with extrahepatic metastases on imaging study and therefore only received chemotherapy. All five patients died from the tumor within 2 to 8 months. Autopsy was performed for all five cases. The autopsy confirmed that the choriocarcinoma was confined to the liver in two surgically resected cases. The other three patients had metastatic choriocarcinoma in the lung (two patients), peritoneum (one patient), adrenal glands (one patient), and brain (one patient). None of the patients had any evidence of a testicular tumor or scar after examination of the entirely submitted testes. No tumor was observed in central nervous system, mediastinum, or other organs other than described above. Grossly, the primary tumors were large, soft, hemorrhagic, and with foci of necrosis. Histologically, the tumors were composed of mononucleated trophoblastic cells with round nuclei, clear cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli admixed with large, multinucleated syncytiotrophoblastic cells. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were strongly positive for keratin, HCG, and focally positive for human placental lactogen. Ki-67 proliferation index was high (mean 75%) in the mononucleated trophoblastic cells. Our series is the largest one to document primary hepatic choriocarcinoma in adults. Although these tumors are rare, they behave in a very aggressive fashion. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

76149093561	Expression of differentiation inhibitory factor and prognosis of malignant tumors	Id proteins, or inhibitors of differentiation/DNA binding, are negative regulators of helix-loop-helix (HLH) type transcription factor, and they can inhibit cell differentiation and promote cell proliferation. Many experiments have proven that high expression of Id proteins in tumors was significantly related to malignant behaviors of tumors, such as tumor invasion and metastasis, suggesting Id proteins can be used to predict the prognosis of tumors. Abnormal expression of Id protein in malignant tumor might be associated with the invasive phenotype and poor prognosis of tumors. Id protein-targeted therapy can effectively inhibit tumor proliferation, invasion and metastasis. This paper reviews the mechanism by which Id protein influences the prognostic factors, such as malignant proliferation, invasion and metastasis, angiogenesis and the researches on progress of related clinical researches.

77950335003	Primary colorectal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour: A clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of seven cases	Aims: Primary colorectal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours are rare. Here we report seven such cases to demonstrate their clinicopathological features and prognosis. Methods: Clinical and pathological data of seven cases of colorectal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining was also performed. Results: The presenting symptoms included abdominal or pelvic mass (7 patients), abdominal pain (7 patients), and lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage (2 patients). The tumour size ranged from 3.8cm to 6.3cm in greatest dimension. Histologically these tumours showed three patterns: myxoid hypocellular, fascicular, and hyalinised pattern. A lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present in all seven tumours. Mitotic figures were 0∼2 per 10 high power fields (HPF) in five cases and were focally up to 4∼6 per 10 HPF in two tumours. Nuclear atypia was mild in five and moderate focally in two tumours. Necrosis was absent. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), smooth muscle actin, and vimentin staining were present in all tumours. S100, CD21, CD34, CD35, desmin, CK, CD68, and CD117 were negative in all inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours. The patients were followed up for 38 years (mean 4.9 years). Five patients were alive without evidence of disease after tumour resection. Two patients had a tumour recurrence 14 and 18 months after the initial surgery, respectively. A second surgical resection was performed for the recurrent tumours and the patients have been free of disease since (now 22 and 35 months after the second surgery, respectively). Conclusions: Colorectal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours are rare, benign or low malignant tumours and ALK positivity is helpful in pathological diagnosis. © 2010 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

77951577954	The development of cancer stem cells	Malignant tumors still remains the disease seriously threatening human being's health. Metastasis and recurrence are the two hang ups for cancer treatment, but the mechanism is yet unclear. The theory of the cancer stem cell gives a new explanation that a small group of tumor cells with selfrenewal and indefinite potency exist in the tumors, which are regarded as the sources in metastasis and recurrence of the tumors. So far, the tumor stem cells have already been separated and determined in leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast. cancer, CNS tumor and lung cancer. The evidence for existence of tumor stem cells have also been found in gastric and liver cancer. The human beings have new cognitions for metastasis and recurrence of tumor with proposal and verification of the theory of the cancer stem cell, which will produce a significant influence on treatment of tumor and prevention for the metastasis and recurrence.

77951763508	The role of AP-1 in the upregulation of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1 in a drug-resistant gastric carcinoma cell line	Objective: To investigate the role of the multi-drug resistance gene MDR1 in the Doxorubicin-resistant SGC7901/ADR gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Methods: We used the MTT assay to determine the cell survival rate of SGC7901 human gastric carcinoma cells and Doxorubicin-resistant SGC7901/ADR cells after treatment with three kinds of commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect the mRNA level of mdr1 and c-Jun in SGC7901 and SGC7901/ADR cells. Transcription factor AP-1 was transfected into SGC7901 and SGC7901/ADR cells, and the transcription activity was assayed by a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The protein expression of P-gp and c-Jun was detected by Western blot. Results: The survival rate of SGC7901/ADR cells was significantly higher than that of SGC7901 cells. The mRNA level of mdr1 and c-Jun was significantly higher in SGC7901/ADR cells than in SGC7901 cells. The transcription activity of transcription factor AP-1 was different between the two cell lines. The levels of P-gp and c-Jun were higher in SGC7901/ADR cells. Conclusion: In the SGC7901/ADR cell line, multiple-drug resistance is increased and an upregulation of the MDR1 gene is observed. In gastric cancer, the activity of transcription factor AP-1 is related to the MDR of cancer cells. The expression of AP-1 may be involved in the mechanism of Doxorubicin resistance in gastric carcinoma cells.

77951820988	Diagnostic utility of novel stem cell markers SALL4, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, UTF1, and TCL1 in primary mediastinal germ cell tumors	Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and sometimes they pose diagnostic difficulty without immunohistochemical studies. Here, we investigated the diagnostic utility of 6 stem cell markers (SCMs) SALL4, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, UTF1, and TCL1 in 16 primary mediastinal seminomas, 3 embryonal carcinomas (ECs), 10 yolk sac tumors (YSTs), 7 teratomas (4 mature, 3 immature), and 1 choriocarcinoma. The percentage of tumor cells stained was scored as: 0 (no tumor cell staining), 1+ (≤30%), 2+ (31% to 60%), 3+ (61% to 90%), and 4+ (>90%). The staining intensity of SCMs was scored as weak, moderate, or strong. We also compared them with currently used GCT markers placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), α-fetoprotein (AFP), c-KIT, CD30, and glypican-3. All 16 seminomas showed staining for SALL4 (4+ in 15, 2+ in 1) (15 strong, 1 moderate), OCT4 (4+ in 11, 3+ in 4, 2+ in 1) (13 strong, 3 moderate), and UTF1 (4+ in 13, 3+ in 2, 2+ in 1) (7 strong, 5 moderate, 4 weak). Positive staining was shown by 9/9 seminomas tested for NANOG (4+ in 7, 2+ in 2) (8 strong, 1 weak), TCL1 (4+ strong in all), c-KIT (4+ in all), and PLAP (4+ in 5, 3+ in 1, 2+ in 2, 1+ in 1), but SOX2 staining was negative in all these tumors. All 3 ECs showed 4+ strong staining for SALL4, OCT4, and UTF1 but negative for TCL1. SOX2 staining was seen in 3/3 ECs (4+ strong in 1, 3+ weak to moderate in 2) whereas NANOG staining was seen in 2/3 ECs (2+ weak, 1+ moderate). CD30 staining was seen in 3/3 ECs (1+, 2+, 4+). Strong SALL4 staining was seen in 10/10 YSTs (4+ in 9, 2+ in 1). All 10 YSTs showed AFP (1+ in 7, 2+ in 1, 3+ in 2) and glypican-3 (1+ in 3, 2+ in 1, 3+ in 5, 4+ in 1) staining but only 4/10 YSTs showed PLAP staining (1+ in all 4). The mean percentage of YST cells stained with SALL4 was 92%, whereas it was 23% for AFP, 50% for glypican-3, and 4% for PLAP (P<0.01). Focal (1+) SALL4 (weak) and SOX2 (weak to moderate) staining was seen in 2/7 and 4/7 teratomas, respectively. The choriocarcinoma was negative for all 6 SCMs. Eleven thymomas and 6 thymic carcinomas were negative for 6 SCMs. No staining of NANOG and SOX2 was seen in 20 lymphomas (5 Hodgkin, 5 large B cell, 5 lymphoblastic, 5 anaplastic large cell) (other 4 SCMs in lymphomas earlier studied). Our study indicates that SALL4, OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, UTF1, and TLC1 are novel sensitive diagnostic markers for primary mediastinal GCTs, with high specificity. Of these 6 SCMs, SALL4 is the only 1 expressed in YST. These novel SCMs are more sensitive than the currently used markers for mediastinal GCTs. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Here we report on 5 such cases (4 males and 1 female, age range 36-45 years). Their presenting symptoms included abdominal mass (5 patients), abdominal pain (4 patients), and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1 patient). Tumor size ranged from 4.5 to 8. cm in the greatest dimension. Histologically, these tumors showed three patterns: myxoid hypocellular, fascicular, and hyalinized. A lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate was present in all 5 tumors. One to two mitotic figures were recognized in 10 high power fields (HPFs) in 4 patients and focally up to 5 in 10. HPFs in 1 patient. No prominent nuclear atypia or necrosis was observed. ALK, smooth muscle actin, and vimentin staining were observed in all tumors. One tumor focally expressed desmin. S-100, CD21, CD34, CD35, CD68, and CD117 were negative in all IMTs. The patients were followed up for 2-5 years (mean 3.4 years), and none of them had tumor metastasis or died. Only one patient developed local recurrence and is now alive with no evidence of disease after the second surgery (11 months after the second surgery). Our results indicate that primary gastric IMTs have an intermediate behavior as seen at other sites. © 2010.

77952915957	Malignant mesenchymoma of the thyroid: Case report and literature review	Malignant mesenchymoma of the thyroid is extremely rare. We report such a tumor involving the bilateral lobes of the thyroid which showed simultaneous chondrosarcomatous, osteosarcomatous, fibrosarcomatous and rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. The patient was a 52-year-old woman admitted with a history of facial swelling, neck thickness and swallowing discomfort of one month's duration. Sonographic examination indicated a thyroid mass involving the bilateral lobes. Macroscopically, the tumors of both lobes were well demarcated, solid, greyish-white, and multinodular on the cut surface. Some nodules were translucent in appearance and hard in texture. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of small primitive mesenchymal cells with osteoid formation resembling the small cell variant of osteosarcoma interspersed with multiple cartilaginous nodules that indicated chondrosarcomatous differentiation. Some tumor cells showed prominent rhabdomyoblastic differentiation with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. Fibrosarcomatous areas were also observed. Immunohistochemically, the small primitive mesenchymal cells were positive for vimentin and CD99 and negative for CD56, Syn, CgA, CK, TG, TTF-1, calcitonin, and S-100. The tumor cells in the rhabdomyosarcomatous area were MyoD1 and muscle-specific actin positive. Molecular analysis for BRAF and RAS gene alterations showed no point mutation. The tumor recurred four months after surgery and tumor thrombi were suspected in the bilateral internal carotid arteries on ultrasonography. Primary malignant mesenchymoma of the thyroid is a high-grade malignant tumor with a poor prognosis. Its differerential diagnosis includes anaplastic carcinoma and other rare sarcomas with chondroid, osteoid, and other mesenchymal metaplasia.

77955659715	Inflammatory angiomyolipomas of the liver: A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical analysis of 5 cases	Hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML) may demonstrate a marked histologic diversity. We report 5 cases of hepatic AML exhibiting prominent inflammatory cells in the background (inflammatory AML). The patients were 4 females and 1 male, with age ranged from 21 to 48 years (mean, 39.2 years). Three tumors were in the left lobe and 2 in the right lobe. The tumor size was from 5.5 to 10 cm in the greatest dimension (mean, 7.46 cm). No patient had clinical features of tuberous sclerosis. Histologically, the striking feature was the infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells in the background of the tumors, including small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The percentage of tumor area with heavy inflammatory infiltration was more than 50% in all cases. The myoid cells were spindled and epithelioid in shape, with eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm, and were arranged in fascicles and clusters. Scattered adipose cells and sinusoidal and thick-walled blood vessels were variably present in all tumors. Focal trabecular arrangement was present in 2 of the 5 tumors. There was no nuclear atypia, and mitotic figures were rare. The myoid cells were diffusely positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and HMB-45 in all cases. All patients showed no evidence of disease after the initial surgical excision during a follow-up period from 3 to 9 years. The inflammatory AMLs should be distinguished from other tumors with inflammatory background such as inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor and follicular dendritic cell tumor. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78649695763	Hepatoblast-Like progenitor cells derived from embryonic stem cells can repopulate livers of mice	Background & Aims Hepatocyte-like cells can be derived from pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, but ES cell-derived hepatic cells with extensive capacity to repopulate liver have not been identified. We aimed to identify and purify ES cell-derived hepatoblast-like progenitor cells and to explore their capacity for liver repopulation in mice after in vitro expansion. Methods Unmanipulated mouse ES cells were cultured under defined conditions and allowed to undergo stepwise hepatic differentiation. The derived hepatic cells were examined by morphologic, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, gene expression, and clonal expansion analyses. The capacities of ES cell-derived hepatic progenitor cells to repopulate liver were investigated in mice that were deficient in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) (a model of liver injury). Results Mouse ES cells were induced to differentiate into a population that contained hepatic progenitor cells; this population included cells that expressed epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) but did not express c-Kit.

Methods Six hundred and sixty-seven cases of core needle biopsy of breast encountered during the period from January, 2004 to June, 2007 were retrieved from the archival file and retrospectively reviewed. The core needle biopsy diagnoses were correlated with the histologic findings of the subsequent surgical excision specimens. The discrepancies were further analyzed. Results Three hundred and eightytwo patients had core needle biopsy diagnosis followed by local excision, breast conservation surgery or mastectomy. Two hundred and eighty-one cases were confirmed to have malignancy in the surgical specimens. Review of the corresponding core needle biopsies showed 4 false-negative cases, no false-positive cases, 28 cases with underestimation and 2 cases with overestimation. The false-negative rate was 1. 4% (4/ 281). The rate of underestimation for ductal carcinoma-in-situ was 6/11. The diagnostic accuracy of core needle biopsy was 94.7% (266/281). Conclusion In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of core needle biopsy of breast tumors, recognition of the limitation of the procedure, application of immunohistochemistry and awareness of potentially rare entities are important.

79952200247	Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor of the heart in a child	We report a case of cardiac perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) that occurred in a 10-year-old girl. The patient presented with cardiac murmur and increasing dyspnea. A solid mass was detected in the left atrioventricular groove by sonography and chest computed tomography. Histologic examination revealed a tumor composed of spindle and epithelioid cells, exhibiting either a clear or a slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and a bland nucleus. Intranuclear pseudoinclusions and calcifications could be found occasionally. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were positive for HMB45, melan-A, and smooth muscle actin. We regard this case as a PEComa of uncertain malignant potential. The patient remains disease free at her 18-month follow up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 3rd report of cardiac PEComa and the 1st report of cardiac PEComa affecting a child. © 2010 Society for Pediatric Pathology.

79953010385	Clinicopathological features of atypical lipomatous tumors of the laryngopharynx	Atypical lipomatous tumor (ALT) of the laryngopharynx is rare. Here we report five cases to demonstrate their clinicopathological features. The patients were four males and one female, aged 41 to 69 years (median 53.6 years). All tumors (two in the hypopharynx and three in the larynx) presented as a slowly growing, painless mass. Symptoms included dysphagia (2/5), dysphonia (3/5), and the feeling of a foreign body in the throat (5/5). Tumors were well circumscribed or focally infiltrative, ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 cm (median, 3.4 cm) in size, and microscopically showed the typical features of lipoma-like ALT. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells were stained with S-100, vimentin, murine double minute 2 (MDM-2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Two patients had local tumor recurrences at 6 and 14 months after initial surgery during follow-up. ALT of laryngopharynx is an indolent tumor. Immunohistochemical staining for MDM-2 and CDK4 is helpful in pathological diagnosis. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

79953874849	Outcomes of loco-regional therapy for down-staging of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to liver transplantation	BACKGROUND: The number of loco-regional therapies (LRTs) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has increased dramatically during the past decade. Many patients with HCC who were beyond the Milan criteria were allowed to receive a liver transplantation (LT) once the HCC was successfully down-staged. This retrospective study aimed to analyze the outcomes of LRTs prior to LT in patients with HCC beyond the Milan criteria. METHODS: We analyzed 56 patients treated from June 2006 to March 2010: 22 met the Milan criteria (T1+T2, 39.3%), 16 had T3 tumors (28.6%), and 11 had T4a tumors (19.6%), while 7 were suspected of tumor vascular invasion (T4b, 12.5%). All patients underwent preoperative LRTs, including transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, liver resection, and/or microwave coagulation therapy. The number of the patients who were successfully down-staged before LT, the types of LRTs used before LT, and their outcomes after LT were recorded. RESULTS: Eleven patients had necrotic tumors (pT0, 19.6%); 6 had pT1 tumors (10.7%), 22 had pT2 tumors (39.3%), 6 had pT3 tumors (10.7%), 5 hadpT4a tumors (8.9%), and6 hadpT4b tumors (10.7%). The histopathologic tumors of 39 patients (69.6%) were down-staged and met the established Milan criteria (pT0-2). Imaging-proven under-staging was present in 5 HCC patients (8.9%) who had tumors involving the intrahepatic venous system. Twenty-three patients (41.1%) had stable HCC and 10 (17.9%) died. The 1-, 3- and 4-year survival rates were 96%, 73% and 61%, respectively, with a mean survival time of 22.29±1.63 months. Six patients died of tumor recurrence. The 1-, 3- and 4-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 88%, 75% and 66%, respectively. The 3-year RFS of patients with pT0-2 tumors was 82%, which was markedly greater than that of patients with pT3 tumors (63%, P= 0.018) or pT4 tumors (17%, P=0.000). Although the 3-year RFS of patients with pT3 tumors was greater than that of patients with pT4 tumors, the difference was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Successful down-staging of HCCs can be achieved in the majority of carefully selected patients by LRTs. Importantly, patients who are successfully down-staged and undergo LT may have a higher RFS rate. © 2011, Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int.

79956051553	Expression and prognostic role of pan-Ras, Raf-1, pMEK1 and pERK1/2 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma	Aims: Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascades play important roles in the transmission of signals involved in apoptosis. Importantly, components of these pathways are aberrantly expressed in human cancer. However, there is limited data linking clinical outcomes with the aberrant expression of this pathway. The present study analyzed the prognostic values of pan-Ras, Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK1 (pMEK1) and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Expression of pan-Ras, Raf-1, pMEK1 and pERK1/2 in 81 HCC patients who underwent curative resection was examined by immunohistochemical staining. Long-term survival after resection of patients according to the expression of pan-Ras, Raf-1, pMEK1 and pERK1/2 was assessed using univariate analysis and multiple Cox proportional hazards model. Results: In univariate analysis, patients with Raf-1 or pMEK1 overexpression had shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P 0.05) and poorer overall survival (OS) (P 0.05) than groups with weak-expression of Raf-1 or pMEK1, respectively. Patients with pan-Ras overexpression had poorer overall survival (OS) (P 0.05) than the group with weak-expression of pan-Ras. Importantly, Raf-1 overexpression was a promising prognostic marker for poor survival according to multivariate Cox regression analysis (DFS, Hazard Ratio 1.807, P = 0.035; OS, Hazard Ratio 1.959, P = 0.044). Conclusions: Raf-1 overexpression could be considered as an independent prognostic biomarker in HCC and may predict early tumor recurrence and death for HCC patients. It can be used to stratify patients at higher risk for poor prognosis and help to select the appropriate therapeutic regime of HCC. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

79958176952	Elevated expression of CUEDC2 protein confers endocrine resistance in breast cancer	Endocrine resistance is a major obstacle to hormonal therapy for breast cancers. Although reduced expression of estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) is a known contributing factor to endocrine resistance, the mechanism of ER-α downregulation in endocrine resistance is still not fully understood. Here we report that CUE domain-"containing protein-2 (CUEDC2), a ubiquitin-binding motif-"containing protein, is a key factor in endocrine resistance in breast cancer. We show that CUEDC2 modulates ER-α protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Through the study of specimens from a large cohort of subjects with breast cancer, we found a strong inverse correlation between CUEDC2 and ER-α protein expression. Notably, subjects with tumors that highly expressed CUEDC2 had poor responsiveness to tamoxifen treatment and high potential for relapse. We further show that ectopic CUEDC2 expression impaired the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Therefore, our findings suggest that CUEDC2 is a crucial determinant of resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer. © 2011 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

79959325993	Coexpression of PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta and VEGF as a prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma	Aims: To evaluate the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor receptoralpha (PDGFR-α) and beta (PDGFR-β) expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: The expression of PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β and VEGF in 63 HCC patients who underwent curative resection was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlations between the expression of these biomarkers and the clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Patient survival was analyzed by univariate analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Univariate survival analysis showed that PDGFR-α or PDGFR-β overexpression was of no prognostic significance in predicting disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (p>0.05), while VEGF overexpression and PDGFR-α/ PDGFR-β/VEGF coexpression were significantly correlated with worse DFS and poorer OS in HCC patients (p<0.05). More importantly, PDGFR-α /PDGFR-β /VEGF coexpression was an independent prognostic marker for poor survival as indicated by multivariate Cox regression analysis (DFS, hazard ratio 3.122, p=0.001; OS, hazard ratio 4.260, p=0.000). Conclusions: Coexpression of PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β and VEGF could be considered an independent prognostic biomarker for predicting DFS and OS in HCC patients. This result could be used to identify patients at a higher risk of tumor recurrence and poor prognosis, and help to select therapeutic schemes for the treatment of HCC. © 2011 Wichtig Editore.

79960130552	Effects of inflammatory factors on mesenchymal stem cells and their role in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis in colon cancer	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which are modulated by cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment, play an important role in tumor progression. It is well documented that inflammation is an important part of the tumor microenvironment, so we investigated whether stimulation of MSCs by inflammatory cytokines would contribute to their ability to promote tumor growth. We first showed that MSCs could increase C26 colon cancer growth in mice. This growth-promoting effect was further accelerated when the MSCs were pre-stimulated by inflammatory factors IFN-γ and TNF-α. At the same time, we demonstrated that MSCs pre-stimulated by both inflammatory factors could promote tumor angiogenesis in vivo to a greater degree than untreated MSCs or MSCs pre-stimulated by either IFN-γ or TNF-α alone. A hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) assay showed that treatment of MSC-conditioned medium can promote chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis in vitro, especially treatment with conditioned medium of MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ and TNF-α together. This mechanism of promoting angiogenesis appears to take place via an increase in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which itself takes place through an increase in signaling in the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α)-dependent pathway. Inhibition of HIF-1α in MSCs by siRNA was found to effectively reduce the ability of MSC to affect the growth of colon cancer in vivo in the inflammatory microenviroment. These results indicate that MSCs stimulated by inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF-α in the tumor microenvironment express higher levels of VEGF via the HIF-1α signaling pathway and that these MSCs then enhance tumor angiogenesis, finally leading to colon cancer growth in mice. © 2011 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

79960197791	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha promotes tumor growth by inducing vascular endothelial growth factor	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α has been proved as an adjuvant therapy for tumor by FDA. However, the effect of chronic TNF-α expression for tumor is still controversial. In this study, we investigated the effect of low-dose TNF-α on tumor growth. We confirmed that low-dose TNF-α promoted angiogenesis of tumor in vivo, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, the transcription factor of VEGF, were both upregulated. Our results suggested that low-dose TNF-α was a powerful activator of angiogenesis in tumor and HIF-1α-VEGF pathway seemed to be the most important molecular mechanism. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

80051746247	Clinical and pathologic features of renal mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the clinical and pathological features of the mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma (MTSCC) of the kidney. Methods: Seven cases of MTSCC were analyzed by gross examination and light microscopy. Immunostaining was performed to detect the expression of CD10, CK7, CK18, CK19, Villin, EMA, P504S and vimentin. The literature on this tumor was reviewed to discuss the histological features of MTSCC and its clinical behavior. Results Three of 7 cases were male and the other 4 were female. The mean age of the patients was 48. 2 years old, with a range from 39 to 61 years. All the patients presented no symptom and their tumors were found by health examination. Tumors averaged 5. 5 cm in greatest dimension (range from 4.0 cm to 9.0 cm). The tumors were well-circumscribed without capsules, and the cut surfaces were solid and soft with white-tan color. By light microscopy, tumors were composed of tightly packed, small, elongated tubules with transitions to spindle cell components. Five cases had mucinous stroma. Clear cell clusters, focal sarcomatoid differentiation, papillations and foamy macrophages were seen in several cases. Immunohistochemically, all 7 cases showed positive for CK7, five of 5 cases positive for EMA, CK18 and P504S, four of 5 cases positive for CK19, but heterogeneous for CD10, villin and vimentin expression. No evidence of local recurrence or distant metastases was identified in the 5 patients with follow-up information. Conclusions The mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma is a low-grade and polymorphic neoplasm. The morphology of these tumors may not be uniform with a wide histological spectrum. The tumors can be tubular predominant or spindle cells predominant with scant to abundant mucinous stroma, which coupled with the presence of other unusual features such as clear cells, papillations, foamy macrophages, necrosis and sarcomatoid differentiation. Immunohistochemically, MTSCC can express the markers from the proximal convoluted tubules to collecting tubules.

80054938093	Immunosuppressive effect of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in inflammatory microenvironment favours the growth of B16 melanoma cells	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are studied for their potential clinical use in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and tumour therapy. However, the therapeutic application of MSCs in tumour therapy still remains limited unless the immunosuppressive role of MSCs for tumour growth in vivo is better understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of MSCs favouring tumour escape from immunologic surveillance in inflammatory microenvironment. We first compared the promotive capacity of bone marrow-derived MSCs on B16 melanoma cells growth in vivo, pre-incubated or not with the inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α. We showed that the development of B16 melanoma cells is faster when co-injected with MSCs pre-incubated with IFN-γ and TNF-α compared with control groups. Moreover, tumour incidence increases obviously in allogeneic recipients when B16 melanoma cells were co-injected with MSCs pre-incubated with IFN-γ and TNF-α. We then demonstrated that the immunosuppressive function of MSCs was elicited by IFN-γ and TNF-α. These cytokine combinations provoke the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by MSCs. The impulsive effect of MSCs treated with inflammatory cytokines on B16 melanoma cells in vivo can be reversed by inhibitor or short interfering RNA of iNOS. Our results suggest that the MSCs in tumour inflammatory microenvironment may be elicited of immunosuppressive function, which will help tumour to escape from the immunity surveillance. © 2011 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

80054978627	Autophagy in hypoxia protects cancer cells against apoptosis induced by nutrient deprivation through a beclin1-dependent way in hepatocellular carcinoma	Oxygen deficiency and nutrient deprivation widely exists in solid tumors because of the poor blood supply. However, cancer cells can survive this adverse condition and proliferate continuously to develop. To figure out the way to survive, we investigated the role of autophagy in the microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma. In order to simulate the tumor microenvironment more veritably, cells were cultured in oxygen-nutrient-deprived condition following a hypoxia preconditioning. As a result, cell death under hypoxia plus nutrient deprivation was much less than that under nutrient deprivation only. And the decreased cell death mainly attributed to the decreased apoptosis. GFP-LC3 and electron microscopy analysis showed that autophagy was significantly activated in the period of hypoxia preconditioning. However, autophagic inhibitor-3-MA significantly abrogated the apoptosis reduction in hypoxia, which implied the involvement of autophagy in protection of hepatocellular carcinoma cells against apoptosis induced by starvation. Furthermore, Beclin 1 was proved to play an important role in this process. siRNA targeting Beclin 1 was transfected into hepatocellular carcinoma cells. And both data from western blot detecting the expression of LC3-II and transmission microscopy observing the accumulation of autophagosomes showed that autophagy was inhibited obviously as a result of Beclin 1 knockdown. Besides, the decreased apoptosis of starved cells under hypoxia was reversed. Taken together, these results suggest that autophagy activated by hypoxia mediates the tolerance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to nutrient deprivation, and this tolerance is dependent on the activity of Beclin 1. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

83455177717	Expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and its clinicopathological significance	Objective To examine granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) expression in human non-small cell lung cancer( NSCLC) as well as discuss its clinicopathological significance. Methods Specimens were obtained from 114 cases(53 cases with granulocyte infiltration) diagnosed pathologically as NSCLC in General Hospital of PLA. Paraffin-embedded tissues from these 114 cases of NSCLC were examined for expression of G-CSF by immunohistochemical staining. Correlation between G-CSF expression and pathological features, clinical manifestation, prognosis of patients with NSCLC was analyzed statistically. All the patients were retrospectively followed-up. Results Fifty-five of the 114 NSCLC specimens expressed G-CSF, and among these 41 (41/54,75. 9% ) were large cell carcinoma, nine (9/30,30.0%) were adenocarcinoma and five (5/30, 16.7%) were squamous cell carcinoma. The expression was significantly correlated with infiltration of tumor mass by neutrophilic granulocytes, histological type, necrosis, differentiation, lymph node metastases, distant metastases, recurrence and survival period ( P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation with primary tumor size (P > 0.05). Logistic multi-factor analysis revealed that necrosis, lymph nodes metastases and distant metastases RR (risk ratio) in G-CSF positive group was 5. 57, 6. 28 and 5. 24 times higher than those of G-CSF negative group (P < 0. 05 ). There were remarkable difference of 5-year survival rates (0 and 12. 1% respectively) and survival period (42 and 62 months respectively) between positive and negative groups (P <0. 01). Conclusions NSCLC with G-CSF excretion are mainly large cell lung cancer. The pathologic characteristics of these cases with G-CSF expression included poor differentiation, remarkable atypia, prominent necrosis and infiltration of tumor mass by neutrophils or emperipolesis. These tumors are usually more aggressive in biological behavior and have worse prognosis than those without G-CSF expression.

84858288644	Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in tumor microenvironment	The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays crucial roles in the formation of the body plan and also in the tumor invasion process. In addition, EMT also causes disruption of cell-cell adherence, loss of apico-basal polarity, matrix remodeling, increased motility and invasiveness in promoting tumor metastasis. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in facilitating cancer metastasis and may induce the occurrence of EMT in tumor cells. A large number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the tumor site, as well as hypoxia existing in a large area of tumor, in addition many stem cells present in tumor microenvironment, such as cancer stem cells (CSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), all of these may be the inducers of EMT in tumor cells. The signaling pathways involved in EMT are various, including TGF-β, NF-κB, Wnt, Notch, and others. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about the role of the tumor microenvironment in EMT and the related signaling pathways as well as the interaction between them. © 2011 Jing et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84859609587	Targeting autophagy potentiates chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and proliferation inhibition in hepatocarcinoma cells	Induction of cell death and inhibition of cell growth are the main targets of cancer therapy. Here we evaluated the role of autophagy on chemoresistance of human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cell lines, focusing on its crosstalk with cell apoptosis and proliferation. In this study, a chemotherapeutic agent (cisplatin or 5FU) induced the formation of autophagosomes in three human HCC cell lines and upregulated the expression of autophagy protein LC3-II. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine or si-beclin 1 increased chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. Meanwhile, increased damage of the mitochondrial membrane potential was also observed in HCC cells when autophagy was inhibited. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy reduced clone formation and impaired cell growth of HCC cells when treated with chemotherapy. Co-administration of an autophagy inhibitor (chloroquine) and chemotherapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft tumor model, with greater extent of apoptosis and impaired proliferation of tumor cells. This study suggests that autophagy is a potential novel target to improve therapy efficiency of conventional chemotherapeutics towards HCC. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84861378593	Clinicopathologic features of primary thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type	Objective: To study the clinicopathologic features of primary thymic extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Methods: The clinical and pathologic findings were evaluated in 3 cases of biopsy confirmed thymic MALT lymphoma. The clincopathologic features, treatment and prognosis were discussed and literatures reviewed. Results: One male and two female patients presented with asymptomatic mediastinal masses with a history of Sjogren syndrome. They were aged 36, 35 and 41 years respectively, and only one patient had B symptoms. Grossly, all three tumors were encapsulated and had multiple variable-sized cysts on cut-surface. Histopathologically, the normal thymic lobular architecture was effaced by abnormal dense lymphoid infiltration. Prominent lymphoepithelial lesions were formed by centrocyte-like cells infiltrating and expanding Hassall's corpuscles and epithelial cyst lining. All cases showed apparent plasmacytic differentiation. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for CD20, CD79a, bcl-2 and negative for CD3, CDS, cyclin Dl, CD43, CD10, bcl-6, and CD23. The plasma cells showed kappa light chain restriction. Immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangement in three cases was confirmed by PCR. All patients were at early stage and received routine chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy after surgical removal. All patients achieved complete remission with 24, 18 and 3 months follow-up, respectively. Conclusions: Primary thymic MALT lymphoma may be a rare distinctive lymphoma. It can be diagnosed by HE and immunohistochemical study and should be differentiated from reactive lymphoid proliferation, other types of lymphoma and mediastinal thymoma.

Methods Clinicopathologic data were analyzed in 375 cases of HCC, in which 80 cases with follow-up were examined by immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of glypican-3, HEP, AFP, CD34 and CD10 proteins. The relationship between the proteins expression and clinicopathologic features was also evaluated. Results Tumor number (P = 0. 000), tumor size (P = 0. 025), tumor differentiation (P = 0.001) and vessel invasion (P = 0.000) were closely related to prognosis of HCC patients; the expression of glypican-3 (66/80,82. 5 % ; P = 0. 002), HEP(64/80,80. 0% ; P = 0. 021), AFP (38/80,47. 5% ;P = 0.014) and CD10 (28/80, 35. 0% ; P = 0. 002) was significantly related to tumor differentiation; that of glypican-3 was significantly correlated with tumor number and presence of satellite nodules (P = 0. 028) and that of AFP and CD 10 was significantly correlated with portal vein thrombi (P =0. 000, P = 0. 010). On Kaplan-Meier regression analysis, both low expression of HEP and high expression of AFP were closely related to poor prognosis. Conclusions Tumor number, size, differentiation and vessel invasion were important factors affecting the prognosis of patients with HCC. HEP and AFP have prognostic significance in HCC.

84862898106	The role of immunosuppression of mesenchymal stem cells in tissue repair and tumor growth	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have acquired great interests for their potential use in the clinical therapy of many diseases because of their functions including multiple lineage differentiation, low immunogenicity and immunosuppression. Many studies suggest that MSCs are strongly immunosuppressive in vitro and in vivo. MSCs exert a profound inhibitory effect on the proliferation of T cells, B cells, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. In addition, several soluble factors have been reported to involved in the immunosuppressive effects by MSCs such as TGF-β, HGF, PGE2, IDO and iNOS. These results suggest that MSCs can be used in the therapy of immune disorder diseases, prevention of organ transplantation rejection and tissue injury. In recent study, we demonstrated that MSCs in tumor inflammatory microenvironment might be elicited of immunosuppressive function. Thus, the application of MSCs in cancer therapy might have negative effect by helping tumor cells escaping from the immune surveillance. © 2012 Han et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84862295360	Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy	In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.

84862938393	Effect of resection following downstaging of unresectable hepatocelluar carcinoma by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization	Background This retrospective study was undertaken to analyze the outcome of hepatic resection in fifty-two patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) between January 2004 and December 2008. Methods Among these fifty-two patients, the mean diameter of the tumor was 7.9 cm (4.4-15.5 cm, median 8.5 cm) prior to the first transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). After 1-6 times of TACE (median 2), the median tumor diameter was reduced to 4.2 cm (0-8.4 cm) prior to resection. The duration between the last TACE treatment and sequential resection varied from one to six months (median 2.7 months). Serum α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were abnormal in thirty-eight out of the fifty-two patients. In AFP producing HCCs, AFP levels returned to normal (≤400 μg /L) in twenty-five out of thirty-eight patients. Hepatic segmentectomy, multiple hepatic segmentectomy or partial hepatic resection were performed in forty-five patients, two underwent extended left hemihepatectomy, and one underwent right posterior branch portal vein thrombectomy. One patient received a right hemihepatectomy and three had left hemihepatectomies. Results Complete tumor radiological response (CR) occurred in five patients (9.6%). There were three cases of perioperative mortality in the fifty-two patients (5.8%). One patient underwent salvaged orthotopic liver transplantation, and twenty-one patients observed tumor recurrence within two years. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates of the fifty-two patients were 77.0% (n=40), 55.0% (n=29), and 52.0% (n=28), respectively. The median survival time after surgery was 49 months (95% confidence interval 7.5-52.7 months). Conclusions TACE treatment provides a better chance for HCC resection in patients initially diagnosed with unresectable HCC. Furthermore, liver resection should be performed once the tumor is downstaged to be compatible for successful resection.

84863095061	The tumor suppressor role of Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 in hepatocellular carcinoma	Purpose: The human gene PTPN11, which encodes the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase of Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), has been previously well interpreted as a proto-oncogene in a variety of malignancies. However, the tumor suppressor role of Shp2 has also been reported. The present study was conducted to investigate the role of Shp2 expression and its associated clinical manifestations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A tissue microarray of 333 pairs of HCC and self-matched adjacent non-tumor tissues was constructed, and the expression of Shp2 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The results were also conformed by Western blotting and quantitative PCR of 31 self-paired fresh HCC specimens. The associations of Shp2 expression with 25 clinicopathologic features were analyzed. Overall survival analysis and multivariate analysis were performed. Results: Significantly decreased Shp2 expression in tumor tissues (T) compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (NT) could be detected, and the positive rate was 66.1 and 96.7%, respectively. We combined the T and NT Shp2 immunoreactivity by a variable of the decrease in Shp2 expression (ΔShp2) and divided cases into 2 groups: T<NT and T ≥ NT. Survival analysis showed both low Shp2 expression and T<NT group were significantly associated with short overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed ΔShp2 was an independent prognostic marker (P = 0.033; HR: 0.527; 95% CI: 0.293-0.950). Conclusion: Shp2 is a tumor suppressor, and the decrease in Shp2 expression was a new prognostic marker in HCC. The oncogenic role of Shp2 was tissue specific, and the therapeutic target of human gene PTPN11 should be reconsidered. © Springer-Verlag 2012.

84863289611	Clinical and pathologic features of gastric schwannoma	Objective To study the clinical and pathologic features of gastric schwannomas. Methods The macroscopic and microscopic features of 9 cases of gastric schwannoma were analyzed. Immunohistochemical study for S-100 protein, CD117, CD34, neurofilament, desmin, nestin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, platelet derived growth factor-alpha ( PDGFR-α ) and vimentin was carried out. Mutation analysis of c-kit gene ( exon 9, 11, 13 and 17) and PDGFR-α gene ( exon 12 and 18) in 1 case was examined by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. Results The patients included 5 males and 4 females. The age of patients ranged from 42 to 81 years (median = 56. 5 years). The size of the tumors ranged from 2 to 9 cm in greatest diameter. Follow-up data in 8 cases (from 1 month to 65 months) showed no evidence of recurrence or metastasis. Gross examination showed that gastric schwannomas were homogeneous, firm, yellow-white and bore no true fibrous capsule. Histologically, all cases were composed of fascicles of spindle cells associated with nuclear palisading, Verocay body formation and peripheral cuff of reactive lymphoid aggregates. Some of them showed degenerative changes including cyst formation, calcification, hemorrhage, necrosis and hyalinization. Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for S-100 protein and vimentin. There was various degree of staining for nestin (8/9) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (6/9). They were negative for CD117, CD34, neurofilament, desmin and smooth muscle actin. One case showed focal positivity for PDGFR-α ( 1/9) , with no mutations found. Conclusions Gastric schwannomas share similar histologic features with conventional soft tissue schwannomas, in addition to the presence a reactive lymphoid cuff. The clinical, macroscopic, histologic and immunohistochemical features of gastric schwannomas were different from those of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and leiomvomas.

84863914609	Pseudomyxoma peritonei of 92 chinese patients: Clinical characteristics, pathological classification and prognostic factors	AIM: To assess the clinicopathologic features and its relationship with prognosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) in Chinese patients. METHODS: The clinicopathologic features and follow-up data of 92 patients with PMP were reviewed and retrospectively analyzed. The cases were categorized into three groups: disseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM), peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis (PMCA), and peritoneal mucinous carcinomatosis with intermediate or discordant features (PMCA-I/D). The log-rank test was used to analyze survival for each group and various clinicopathological parameters. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard models were constructed to determine the important factors associated with survival. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 51.9 years (range: 22-76 years). The median follow up was 124 mo. The 3-, 5-and 10-year survival rates were 74.0%, 67.4% and 49.1%, respectively. There were 49 (53.2%) patients with DPAM, 26 (28.3%) with PMCA-I and 17 (18.5%) with PMCA. Patients with DPAM, PMCA-I/D and PMCA exhibited statistically significant difference in survival (P = 0.001). The 3 year survival for DPAM, PMCAI/D and PMCA was 97.0%, 80.0% and 67.0%, respectively; the 5 year survival was 80.0%, 67.0% and 50.0%, respectively; and the 10 year survival was 65.0%, 28.0% and 14.0%, respectively. Survival rate was significantly lowest in patients < 40 age years of age (P = 0.011). Appendiceal tumor and extra-ovarian parenchymal organ involvement were significantly related to overall survival. Patients with appendiceal mucinous adenocarcinoma (MACA) showed the significantly poorer prognosis (P = 0.011). Multivariate analysis showed that pathological classification, age, appendiceal tumor were significant related to overall survival. CONCLUSION: The clinical process "PMP" should be pathologically classified into DPAM, PMCA and PMCA-I/ D. Pathological classification, age, appendiceal MACA are survival independent predictors in Chinese patients with PMP. © 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

84865055182	The development of cancer stem cells	Malignant tumors still remains the disease seriously threatening human being's health. Metastasis and recurrence are the two hang ups for cancer treatment, but the mechanism is yet unclear. The theory of the cancer stem cell gives a new explanation that a small group of tumor cells with self-renewal and indefinite potency exist in the tumors, which are regarded as the sources in metastasis and recurrence of the tumors. So far, the tumor stem cells have already been separated and determined in leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, CNS tumor and lung cancer. The evidence for existence of tumor stem cells have also been found in gastric and liver cancer. The human beings have new cognitions for metastasis and recurrence of tumor with proposal and verification of the theory of the cancer stem cell, which will produce a significant influence on treatment of tumor and prevention for the metastasis and recurrence.

84864780648	CD133	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC), which frequently metastasizes to the liver, is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Growing evidence suggests that a subset of cells exists among cancer stem cells. This distinct subpopulation is thought to contribute to liver metastasis; however, it has not been fully explored in CRC yet.Methods: Flow cytometry analysis was performed to detect distinct subsets with CD133 and CXCR4 markers in human primary and metastatic CRC tissues. The 'stemness' and metastatic capacities of different subpopulations derived from the colon cancer cell line HCT116 were compared in vitro and in vivo. The roles of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the metastatic process were also investigated. A survival curve was used to explore the correlation between the content of CD133

84865405555	Distribution of lymphoid neoplasms in China: Analysis of 4,638 cases according to the World Health Organization Classification	To estimate the distribution of lymphoid neoplasms in China, we conducted a comprehensive analysis, based on subtype, age, sex, and lesion, of primary and resected biopsy specimens of 4,638 lymphoid neoplasms diagnosed from 2004 to 2008 at 5 large hospitals. Of the 4,638 patients, mature B-cell neoplasms accounted for 64.3% of all lymphoid neoplasms, mature T/NK-cell neoplasms for 23.3%, and Hodgkin lymphoma for 8.6%. The most common subtype was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (36.2%), followed by extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (11.0%), classic Hodgkin lymphoma (8.4%), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (7.7%), plasmacytic neoplasm (5.0%), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (3.9%). For most lymphoid neoplasm subtypes, male subjects showed higher rates than female subjects. In summary, our study showed that the epidemiologic features of lymphoid neoplasms in China are distinct from those in Western countries and similar in many ways to those in other countries of the Far East.

84865527612	Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Inflammation Microenvironment Accelerates Hepatocellular Carcinoma Metastasis by Inducing Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition	In response to inflammation, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to migrate to tissue injury sites to participate in immune modulation, tissue remodeling and wound healing. Tumors apply persistent mechanical and pathological stress to tissues and causes continual infiltration of MSCs. Here, we demonstrate that MSCs promote human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis under the influence of inflammation. The metastasis promoting effect could be imitated with the supernatant of MSCs pretreated with IFNγ and TNFα. Interestingly, treatment of HCC cells with the supernatant leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an effect related to the production of TGFβ by cytokines stimulated MSCs. Importantly, the levels of MSCs expressing SSEA4 in clinical HCC samples significantly correlated with poor prognosis of HCC, and EMT of HCC was strongly associated with a shorter cancer-free interval (CFI) and a worse overall survival (OS). Therefore, our results suggest that MSCs in tumor inflammatory microenvironment could promote tumor metastasis through TGFβ-induced EMT. © 2012 jing et al.

84865563975	Toll-like receptor 4 signaling promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human hepatocellular carcinoma induced by lipopolysaccharide	Background: The endotoxin level in the portal and peripheral veins of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is higher and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall constituent of gram-negative bacteria, has been reported to inhibit tumor growth. However, in this study, we found that LPS-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling was involved in tumor invasion and survival, and the molecular mechanism was investigated,. Methods: Four HCC cell lines and a splenic vein metastasis of the nude mouse model were used to study the invasion ability of LPS-induced HCC cells and the epithelia-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. A total of 106 clinical samples from HCC patients were used to evaluate TLR4 expression and analyze its association with clinicopathological characteristics. Results: The in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that LPS could significantly enhance the invasive potential and induce EMT in HCC cells with TLR4 dependent. Further studies showed that LPS could directly activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling through TLR4 in HCC cells. Interestingly, blocking NF-κB signaling significantly inhibited transcription factor Snail expression and thereby inhibited EMT occurrence. High expression of TLR4 in HCC tissues was strongly associated with both poor cancer-free survival and overall survival in patients.Conclusions: Our results indicate that TLR4 signaling is required for LPS-induced EMT, tumor cell invasion and metastasis, which provide molecular insights for LPS-related pathogenesis and a basis for developing new strategies against metastasis in HCC. © 2012 Jing et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84867526968	Correlation of KRAS gene mutations and clinicopathologic parameters in colorectal carcinoma	Objective: To investigate the relationship between KRAS gene mutations and clinicopathological parameters in patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Methods: PCR-based direct sequencing was used to detect the mutations of KRAS gene and to correlate between clinicopathological characteristics and the presence of various KRAS mutations in 244 cases of CRC. Results: KRAS mutations were identified in 92 cases (37. 7%) of CRC. Five types of mutation were detected at codon 12, including G12D (40 cases, 16.4%), G12V (16 cases, 6.6%), G12A (7 cases, 2. 9%), G12S (5 cases, 2.0%) and G12C (4 cases, 1. 6%). Two types of mutation were detected at codon 13, including G13D (17 cases, 7. 0%) and G13C (2 cases, 0. 8%). One type of mutation was detected in codon 61, i. e. Q61 K (1 case, 0. 4%). KRAS mutation rate was higher in females (45. 6%, 36/79) than in males (32. 1%, 53/165; P < 0. 05), but not related to another clinicopathological characteristics. Conclusions: Female CRC patients have a higher KRAS mutation rate than the male patients. KRAS mutation has no significant correlation with patient's age, tumor site, tumor gross appearance, degree of differentiation, depth of invasion, TNM stages, lymphatic invasion, abdominal or distant metastases and prognosis in this study.

84867735741	Diagnosis of gastric intraepithelial neoplasia by narrowband imaging and confocal laser endomicroscopy	AIM: To evaluate the diagnosis of different differentiated gastric intraepithelial neoplasia (IN) by magnification endoscopy combined with narrow-band imaging (ME-NBI) and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE). METHODS: Eligible patients with suspected gastric IN lesions previously diagnosed by endoscopy in secondary hospitals and scheduled for further diagnosis and treatment were recruited for this study. Excluded from the study were patients who had liver cirrhosis, impaired renal function, acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, coagulopathy, esophageal varices, jaundice, and GI post-surgery. Also excluded were those who were pregnant, breastfeeding, were younger than 18 years old, or were unable to provide informed consent. All patients had all mucus and bile cleared from their stomachs. They then received upper GI endoscopy. When a mucosal lesion is found during observation with whitelight imaging, the lesion is visualized using maximal magnification, employing gradual movement of the tip of the endoscope to bring the image into focus. Saved images are analyzed. Confocal images were evaluated by two endoscopists (Huang J and Li MY), who were familiar with CLE, blinded to the related information about the lesions, and asked to classify each lesion as either a low grade dysplasia (LGD) or high grade dysplasia (HGD) according to given criteria. The results were compared with the final histopathologic diagnosis. ME-NBI images were evaluated by two endoscopists (Lu ZS and Ling-Hu EQ) who were familiar with NBI, blinded to the related information about the lesions and CLE images, and were asked to classify each lesion as a LGD or HGD according to the "microvascular pattern and surface pattern" classification system. The results were compared with the final histopathologic diagnosis. RESULTS: The study included 32 pathology-proven low grade gastric IN and 26 pathology-proven high grade gastric IN that were detected with any of the modalities. CLE and ME-NBI enabled clear visualization of the vascular microsurface patterns and microvascular structures of the gastric mucosa. The accuracy of the CLE and the ME-NBI diagnosis was 88% (95% CI: 78%-98%) and 81% (95% CI: 69%-93%), respectively. The kappa coefficient of agreement between the histopathology and the in vivo CLE imaging was 0.755; between the histopathology and the in vivo CLE imaging was 0.615. McNemar's test (binomial distribution used) indicated that the agreement was significant (P < 0.05). When patients were diagnosed by ME-NBI with CLE, the overall accuracy of the diagnosis was 86.21% (95% CI: 73%-96%), and the kappa coefficient of agreement was 0.713, according to McNemar's test (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Higher diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of CLE over ME-NBI indicate the feasibility of these two techniques for the efficacious diagnostic classification of gastric IN. © 2012 Baishideng.

84868195394	Background progenitor activation is associated with recurrence after hepatectomy of combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma	Hepatic progenitor cells (HPC) play important roles in both liver regeneration and carcinogenesis. Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (CHC), a malignant primary liver tumor with poor prognosis, is thought to be of HPC origin. However, the prognostic significance of this etiology is not well defined. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the relationship of HPC-related pathological features and long-term outcome in patients with CHC in our department. In a cohort of 80 patients identified between 1997 and 2003, including 70 patients who underwent resection with curative intent, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were correlated with the proliferative activity of nontumor ductular reaction (DR) and the expression levels of HPC and biliary markers including α-fetoprotein (AFP), keratin 7 (K7), keratin 19 (K19), oval cell (OV)-6, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and c-Kit in both tumor and nontumor liver. We found that nontumor ductular reactions (DRs), specifically the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index of the ductular reaction (PI-DR), a surrogate for transit-amplifying compartments, was an independent prognostic factor for both OS and DFS. By contrast, intratumoral expression of only one marker, absence of AFP, was associated with OS. PI-DR was also independently associated with synchronous "multicentric occurrence" in hepatocellular carcinoma components, a feature of CHC that may predispose to metachronous multifocal tumorigenesis. Conclusion: Proliferative ductular reaction related to HPC activation is associated with recurrence of CHC. Background HPC activation is strongly associated with multifocal occurrence and related tumor recurrence, highlighting the critical role of background liver disease, a "field effect," in the recurrence of CHC. © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.

84868665045	Severity of portal hypertension and prediction of postoperative liver failure after liver resection in patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis	Background: Patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis and clinical evidence of portal hypertension are likely to develop posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Whether such patients are suitable candidates for partial hepatectomy is controversial. This study explored the impact of portal venous pressure (PVP) on PHLF and the possibility of stratifying patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis for risk of PHLF using clinical data alone. Methods: Between April 2009 and May 2011, consecutive patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma and intraoperative measurement of PVP were included in this prospective study. Using signs of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis were subclassified into three groups: no, mild and severe CSPH. Risk factors for PHLF were subjected to univariable and multivariable analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Sixty-seven (35·3 per cent) of 190 patients developed PHLF, which was persistent in 12 patients (6·3 per cent). Four patients (2·1 per cent) died from PHLF within 3 months of surgery. Multivariable analysis showed both PVP and CSPH to be independent predictors of PHLF (P < 0·001). PVP values, incidence of PHLF and persistent PHLF were significantly higher in the severe CSPH group than in the other two groups (P < 0·001). Severe CSPH (odds ratio 27·68, P = 0·005) and a preoperative neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of 2·8 or above (odds ratio 49·75, P = 0·002) were independent factors affecting the incidence of persistent PHLF. Conclusion: The severity of CSPH, corresponding to different PVP levels, could be used to stratify patients with Child-Pugh grade A cirrhosis and to predict the incidence of PHLF. Patients with severe CSPH or a NLR of 2·8 or above were more likely to develop persistent PHLF after partial hepatectomy. © 2012 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

84869783465	Analysis of mortality causes for 165 type 2 diabetics: An autopsy study	Objective: To analyze the main mortality causes and pathological characteristics of type 2 diabetics with autopsy findings. Methods: A total of 165 autopsy reports of type 2 diabetics were retrospectively reviewed and summarized at our institution. And 165 non-diabetics during the same period were analyzed similarly. Results: The clinical data showed that type 2 diabetics had a higher risk for coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, hyperlipidemia and renal diseases than non-diabetics (P < 0.05). The pathological data revealed that the rate of myocardium diseases in type 2 diabetics (69.6%, n = 103) was higher than that in non-diabetics (58.6%, n = 85). The evaluation of aortosclerotic grading demonstrated that the degree of arteriosclerosis in type 2 diabetics was severer than that in non-diabetics. The organ weight analysis showed the weight of thyroid, heart, liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal gland and brain had no significant difference between type 2 diabetics and non-diabetics (P > 0.05). The three major mortality causes were malignant neoplasms (39.4%, n = 65), circulatory system diseases (35.2%, n = 58) and respiratory system diseases (9.1%, n = 15). Conclusion: The onset of malignant tumors, especially gastrointestinal one, should be monitored closely during the prevention and treatment of cardiocerebrovascular diseases and complications.

84869796990	Experience of the treatment following downstaging of larger hepatocellular carcinomas by transcathetheter hepaticarterial chemoembolization in 58 patients	Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of sequential liver resection or liver transplantation following downstaging of larger hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Methods: A retrospective study was conducted. And a total of 58 patients with unresectable larger HCC (diameter >5 cm) from June 2006 to March 2010 underwent TACE. According the outcomes of TACE, they received liver transplantation (LT, n=36) and liver resection (LR, n=22) respectively. The overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The multivariate analyses for the influencing factors were evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The median follow-up period of 58 cases was 22 months and the median survival time 23.57 ± 1.54 months. The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS and RFS rates after LT was 94%, 84% & 73% and 88%, 75% & 64% respectively. The median recurrence time was 12.3 ± 6.4 months (range: 3-23). Twenty-eight patients had adequate downstaging to qualify for LT under the Milan criteria. The 1-, 2-, 3-year OS and RFS of the downstaging group was better than those of the non-downstaging group (OS: 96%, 88%, 75% vs 92%, 48%, 48% P =0.067; RFS: 95%, 95%, 79% vs 76%, 40%, 40% P=0.002). The 1-, 2-, 3-years OS and RFS after LR was 100%, 64% & 52% and 72%, 49% & 49% respectively. The median recurrence time was 9.3 ± 4.5 months (range: 3-23). The long-term results of LT group following TACE were better than those of LR group (OS, P=0.178; RFS, P=0.139). The multivariate analyses showed that only pathologic total tumor diameter > 7 cm (P=0.002, RR=6.578), microvascular invasion (P=0.001, RR=5.737) and poor differentiation (P=0.048, RR=4.335) were significantly correlated with tumor recurrence. Conclusion: Sequential liver resection and liver transplantation after downstaging by TACE are feasible for some larger HCCs. And the long-term prognosis is satisfactory.

84872128630	Perineural invasion in hilar cholangiocarcinoma and distribution of nerve plexuses around porta hepatis	Objective: To explore the incidence of perineural invasion (PNI) in hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA) and summarize the distribution pattern of nerve plexuses around porta hepatis. Methods: Reported series on PNI in HCCA were systematically reviewed. A clinicopathological study was conducted on sections from 75 HCCA patients to summarize the incidence and modes of PNT. Immunohistochemical stains for CD34 and D2-40 in tumor tissue were performed to clarify the association of PNI with microvessel and lymphoduct. Sections of different decks of hepatoduodenal ligament from 5 autopsy cases were scanned and computerized to display the distribution of nerve plexuses around porta hepatis. Results: The incidence of PNT in HCCA in literature ranged from 59.2% to 100%. Tn the present study, the overall incidence of PNT was 92.0% (69/75). However, the incidence of PNT showed no remarkable differences among various differentiated groups and Bismuth-Corlette classification groups. Tumor cells could invade microvessels and lymphoducts in HCCA. But no invasion of nerves occurred via microvessels or lymphoducts as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Three nerve plexuses in hepatoduodenal ligament and Glisson's sheath were classified and they all surrounded great vessels very closely. Conclusion: PNI is generally underreported in HCCA. A surgeon should handle diligently the nerve plexuses around porta hepatis.

84875888914	Chloroquine promotes the anticancer effect of TACE in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model	Background: To investigate the efficacy of TACE combined with CQ, an autophagic inhibitor, in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model. Methods: Tumor size was measured. And tumor growth rate was calculated to examine the effect of the combined treatment. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Meanwhile, autophagic activity was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting to investigate the mechanism underlying. Liver function was also examined to assess feasibility and safety of the combined therapy. Results: Tumors in the control grew more than 4 times bigger after 14 days, while that in the group of TACE alone just showed mild growth. But a slight shrinkage was shown after the treatment of CQ+TACE. Growth ratio of TACE alone was 96.45% ± 28.958% while that of CQ+TACE was -28.73% ± 12.265%. Compared with TACE alone, necrosis in CQ+TACE showed no significant difference, however, the apoptosis was much higher. There were only 14.8±3.11% apoptotic cells in TACE, but 33±4.18% in CQ+TACE, which suggests the increased apoptosis in CQ+TACE contributed to the decrease of tumor volume. In terms of autophagic activity, the result is negative when we immunostained sections of the control with LC3 antibody, but positive in TACE alone and CQ+TACE. And the result of Western blot showed that there was just a low level of LC3 II expressed in the control and CQ alone, but higher in TACE, and much higher in CQ+TACE because CQ inhibited its degradation in autophagy. Compared with control, p62 decreased in TACE, but the decrease was partially reversed in CQ+TACE. In addition, toxicity of CQ+TACE was assessed not higher than TACE alone, which supports the safety of CQ+TACE. Conclusion: CQ+TACE works better than TACE alone in rabbit VX2 liver tumor model because CQ inhibits autophagy induced by TACE. The inhibited autophagy loses its resistance to apoptosis that apoptosis increased, which contributes to the inhibition of tumor growth. This study indicates CQ may be a promising adjuvant to promote the effect of TACE. © Ivyspring International Publisher.

84875995650	Paradoxical role of autophagy in the dysplastic and tumor-forming stages of hepatocarcinoma development in rats	Many reports have shown that autophagy has a role as both a promoter and inhibitor in tumor development. However, the mechanism of this paradox is unknown. Tumor development is a multistep process. Therefore, we investigated whether the role of autophagy in hepatocarcinoma formation depended on the stage of tumor development. Based on our results, autophagy inhibition by chloroquine had a tumor-promotive effect in the rat model with N-diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in its dysplastic stage (Ds) and a tumor-suppressive effect in its tumor-forming stage (Ts). In the Ds, autophagy inhibition enhanced cell proliferation, DNA damage and inflammatory cytokines expression in liver. These changes were dependent on the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that was resulted from autophagy inhibition, and ultimately accelerated the process of hepatocarcinogenesis. However, in the Ts, autophagy inhibition restrained tumor formation by decreasing tumor cell survival and proliferation. In this stage, autophagy inhibition led to excessive ROS accumulation in the tumor, which promoted cell apoptosis, and prominently suppressed tumor cell metabolism. Taken together, our data suggested that autophagy suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis in the Ds by protecting normal cell stability and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis in the Ts by supporting tumor cells growth. Autophagy always had a role as a protector throughout the process of hepatocarcinoma development. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.

84878694814	Autophagy lessens ischemic liver injury by reducing oxidative damage	Background: Hepatic ischemia/reperfusion is a multi-factorial process which causes liver injury. It is reported that ischemia alone is sufficient to induce liver injury. Nutrient deprivation is a crucial factor impacting ischemic injury of the liver. Therefore, we explored the role of autophagy in ischemia through using hepatic ischemia rat model in vivo and nutrient-free model in vitro.Results: We found that both ischemia in vivo and nutrient deprivation in vitro activated autophagy, inhibition of which aggravated ischemia- or nutrient deficiency-induced injury. In the nutrient-free condition, autophagy inhibition enhanced liver cell necrosis but not apoptosis by promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and antioxidant NAC could reverse this trend. Inhibition of autophagy also resulted in the increase of the percentage of necrotic cell but not apoptotic cell in the ischemia-treated rat livers. Further studies showed that under nutrient deprivation, autophagy inhibition promoted mitochondrial ROS generation, which further aggravated mitochondria damage. These changes formed a " vicious cycle" that accelerated the process of cell necrosis. Autophagy inhibition also increased mitochondrial oxidative stress during hepatic ischemia, and antioxidant could suppress the aggravation of ischemia-induced liver damage in the co-treatment of autophagy inhibitor.Conclusions: Taken together, our results suggested that autophagy suppressed ischemic liver injury by reducing ROS-induced necrosis. This finding will contribute to the development of the therapeutic strategy about the pre-treatment of liver surgery. © 2013 Sun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84879517225	One cell, multiple roles: Contribution of mesenchymal stem cells to tumor development in tumor microenvironment	The discovery of tissue reparative and immunosuppressive abilities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has drawn more attention to tumor microenvironment and its role in providing the soil for the tumor cell growth. MSCs are recruited to tumor which is referred as the never healing wound and altered by the inflammation environment, thereby helping to construct the tumor microenvironment. The environment orchestrated by MSCs and other factors can be associated with angiogenesis, immunosuppression, inhibition of apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), survival of cancer stem cells, which all contribute to tumor growth and progression. In this review, we will discuss how MSCs are recruited to the tumor microenvironment and what effects they have on tumor progression. © 2013 Yang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84879605085	Inhibition of autophagy enhances anticancer effects of bevacizumab in hepatocarcinoma	Angiogenesis inhibitors have long been considered desirable anticancer agents. However, it was found that many tumors could develop resistance to antiangiogenesis inhibitors. Antiangiogenic therapy results in metabolic stress. Autophagy is an important survival mechanism in cancer cells under metabolic stress; however, it remains unknown if autophagy contributes to antiangiogenesis resistance. In this study, we reported that bevacizumab treatment reduced the development of new blood vessels and inhibited cell growth in xenografts of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. Bevacizumab treatment also upregulated expression of the autophagy-related genes (Beclin1 and LC3) and increased autophagosome formation. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that autophagy inhibition significantly increased apoptosis of HCC cells during nutrient starvation or hypoxia. In addition, the combined treatment of an autophagy inhibitor and bevacizumab markedly inhibited the tumor growth of HCC xenografts, led to enhanced apoptosis, and impaired the proliferation of tumor cells compared with treatment with either drug alone. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition led to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HCC cells exposed to nutrient starvation or hypoxia in vitro and increased DNA oxidative damage in vivo. Antioxidants reduced nutrient starvation or the hypoxia-induced cell death of HCC cells after autophagy inhibition. Our results suggest that autophagy modulates ROS generation and contributes to cell survival under metabolic stress. Therefore, autophagy inhibition may be a novel way of increasing the efficicacy of antiangiogenic agents in the treatment of HCC. © 2012 The Author(s).

84880421590	Primary hepatic angiosarcoma: A clinical and pathological analysis	Objective: To investigate the clinicopathological characteristics, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of primary hepatic angiosarcoma, and to review the literature. Methods: Twenty cases of primary hepatic angiosarcoma were analyzed by gross examination and light microscopy. Immunostaining was performed to detect the expression of CD34, CD31, FVIII RAg, CK, GPC-3, Hepatocyte, vimentin, PTEN, desmin, and CD117. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 7 to 86 years. Eleven cases were male, and 9 were female. All cases showed no specific clinical manifestations and imaging results. Macroscopically, the tumors showed diffuse multi-nodular or single nodular patterns with hemorrhage. Microscopically, there were various patterns such as cavernous vascular space and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma-like appearances; however, specific pathological diagnostic features of angiosarcoma still existed in all cases. All of the cases expressed at least one of the three immunohistochemical markers: CD31, CD34 and/or FVIII Rag. Ten cases had PTEN low expression. Ki-67 proliferative index was more than 10% in all cases. None of cases expressed desmin, CD117, GPC-3 or Hepatocyte. Conclusions: Primary hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor. Detailed morphological observation and using various vascular endothelial immunohistochemical markers can help to establish the diagnosis accurately.

84881122467	Rosiglitazone protects against palmitate-induced pancreatic beta-cell death by activation of autophagy via 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase modulation	Promoting beta-cell survival is crucial for the prevention of beta-cell failure in diabetes. Thiazolidinediones, a widely used drug to improve insulin sensitivity in clinical practice, is found to have a protective effect on islet beta-cell. To date, the mechanism underlying the protective role of thiazolidinedione on beta-cell survival remain largely unknown. Activation of autophagy was detected by transmission electron microscopy, western blot, and GFP-LC3 transfection. Cell viability was examined by WST-8. Cell apoptosis was demonstrated by DAPI and Annexin V/PI staining. Colony formation assay was used to detect long-term cell viability. We demonstrated that rosiglitazone-treated beta-cells were more resistant to palmitate-induced apoptosis. The conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and accumulated autophagosomes were found to be upregulated in rosiglitazone-treated cells. Inhibition of autophagy augmented palmitate-induced apoptosis with rosiglitazone treatment, suggesting that autophagy plays an important role in the survival function of rosiglitazone on beta-cells. Furthermore, we showed that rosiglitazone could induce AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and reduce p70S6 kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of AMPK impaired autophagy activation and enhanced palmitate-induced apoptosis during rosiglitazone treatment. These findings reveal that rosiglitazone-induced autophagy contributes to its protective function on beta-cells during palmitate treatment. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

84883445521	Autophagy contributes to the survival of CD133+ liver cancer stem cells in the hypoxic and nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment	Liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) can drive and maintain hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Therefore, they are potentially responsible for the poor prognosis of HCC. Oxygen and nutrient deficiencies are common characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. However, how LCSCs adapt to oxygen- and nutrient-deprived conditions is unclear. Here, we used immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis to show that CD133+ cells were significantly enriched after hypoxia and nutrient starvation (H/S) in the human HCC cell line Huh7. Sorted CD133+ cells showed higher survival, less apoptosis, and possess higher clonogenic ability under H/S compared to the CD133- population. Under H/S, electron microscopy revealed more advanced autophagic vesicles in CD133+ cells. Additionally, CD133+ cells had higher autophagy levels as measured by both RT-qPCR and Western blotting. CD133+ cells had more accumulated GFP-LC3 puncta, which can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. The autophagic inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) significantly increased apoptosis and decreased the clonogenic capacity of CD133+ cells under H/S. Pre-culturing in H/S enhanced the sphere-forming capacity of CD133+ cells. However, CQ significantly impaired this process. Therefore, autophagy is essential for LCSCs maintenance. CD133+ cells were also found to have a higher tumor-forming ability in vivo, which could be inhibited by CQ administration. Collectively, our results indicate that the involvement of autophagy in maintenance of CD133+ LCSCs under the oxygen- and nutrient-deprived conditions that are typical of the tumor microenvironment in HCC. Therefore, autophagy inhibitors may make LCSCs more sensitive to the tumor microenvironment and be useful in improving anti-cancer treatments. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

84884366045	Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of chinese patients with sarcomatoid carcinoma of the bladder	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the clinicopathological features and prognosis of Chinese patients diagnosed with sarcomatoid carcinoma (SC) of the bladder. Methods: 13 patients admitted to the General Hospital of People's Liberation Army (PLA) between 1999 and 2010 (study group) and 74 Chinese patients diagnosed between 1994 and 2010 and reported in one of two Chinese databases (literature group). Results: The two groups were similar in all demographic and clinical characteristics except depth of tumor invasion. SC of the bladder was most common in older males and most patients had high-grade or late-stage disease at diagnosis. The 6-month, 1-year, 2-year, and 5-years survival rates were 78.9%, 42.7%, 28.0%, and 21.0%, respectively. Analysis of the association of demographic and clinical characteristics with prognosis indicated no significant effect of sex, age, lesion location, tumor diameter, tumor type, depth of invasion, type of surgery, gross hematuria, and urinary tract infection. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the pathologic tumor stage was unrelated to prognosis. Early diagnosis and surgical intervention are preferred strategies for improvement of prognosis. The association between clinical stage and survival time requires further analysis.

84884515679	Tumor necrosis factor-α attenuates starvation-induced apoptosis through upregulation of ferritin heavy chain in hepatocellular carcinoma cells	Background: Tumor microenviroment is characteristic of inflammation, ischemia and starvation of nutrient. TNF-α, which is an extraordinarily pleiotropic cytokine, could be an endogenous tumor promoter in some tumor types. The basic objective of this study was to investigate the effects of TNF-α on the cell viability and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells under serum starvation, and to identify the molecular mechanisms involved.Methods: For this purpose, five different concentrations of TNF-α and two different serum settings (serum-cultured and serum-deprived) were used to investigate the effects of TNF-α on the cell viability and apoptosis of Hep3B and SMMC-7721 cells. Results: TNF-α (10 ng/ml) attenuated serum starvation-induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and autophagy conferred this process. BAY11-7082, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, reversed the suppression of serum starvation-induced apoptosis by TNF-α. Moreover, TNF-α-induced NF-κB transactivation was suppressed by autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. In addition, TNF-α up-regulated Ferritin heavy chain (FHC) transiently by NF-κB activation and FHC levels were correlated with the TNF-α-induced protection against serum starvation-mediated apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, FHC-mediated inhibition of apoptosis depended on suppressing ROS accumulation. Conclusions: Our findings suggested that autophagy conferred the TNF-α protection against serum starvation-mediated apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells, the mechanism involved with the activation of the TNF-α/ NF-κB /FHC signaling pathway. © 2013 Kou et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84884976653	HPIP is upregulated in liver cancer and promotes hepatoma cell proliferation via activation of G2/M transition	Hematopoietic pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor (PBX)-interacting protein (HPIP) has been shown to play a role in cancer development and progression. However, the detailed role of HPIP in cancer cell growth and the exact mechanism by which HPIP regulates cancer cell proliferation remains unclear. Here, we report that HPIP is overexpressed in most of 328 liver cancer patients and regulates hepatoma cell proliferation through G2/M checkpoint activation. HPIP increased anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of human liver cancer cell lines. The amino acid region 531-631 of HPIP was important for its modulation of liver cancer cell growth. The increased effects of HPIP on liver cancer cell proliferation were associated with activation of the G2/M cell-cycle concomitant with a marked increase of cyclin B1 and the inhibition of the negative G2/M phase regulator GADD45α. HPIP knockdown dramatically suppressed the growth of HepG2 liver cancer cells in nude mice. These data highlight the important role of HPIP in liver cancer cell growth and suggest that HPIP may be a good target for liver cancer therapy. © 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

84892959141	Diagnosis and multi-modality treatment of adult pulmonary plastoma: Analysis of 18 cases and review of literature	The clinical data of 18 patients with PB from April 1989 to April 2013 was analyzed retrospectively, including 11 men and 7 women, aged 45 and 76 years old (mean 53 years). There were 12 cases of PB occurring in right lung and other cases in left lung. Among them, 3 patients had no symptoms, and 15 patients displayed symptoms of cough, chest pain, asthenia or minor haemoptysis. Overall, 11 patients had a preoperative diagnosis of lung cancer, 7 patients were preoperatively diagnosed as the other diseases, which included lung benign tumor (n=5) and mediastinal mass (n=2). All patients received a radical resection. Six patients received postoperative cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and two patients received postoperative irradiation with the dose of 55 Gy. Histologically, 14 cases of 18 patients had biphasic pulmonary blastoma and four cases had well differentiated fetal adenocarcinoma. A total of 12 patients died in a period of 6-36 months after operation, and 1 case was lost after 2 years of follow up. The median survival time was 19 months. PB is a rare primary lung malignant embryonal neoplasm. Despite its assumed embyonal origin, the tumor has a predilection for adults. A preoperative correct diagnosis is very difficult in spite of modern diagnostic imaging and biopsy techniques. Surgical resection is the main method for diagnosis and treatment. Postoperative chemotherapy or irradiation can help eliminate tumor remnants. Its prognosis is very poor, especially for the biphasic type. © 2014 Hainan Medical College.

84893180241	Peritumoral ductular reaction: A poor postoperative prognostic factor for hepatocellular carcinoma	Background: The role of ductular reaction (DR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated.Methods: In this study, we tried to uncover possible effect by correlating peritumoral DR in a necroinflammatory microenvironment with postoperative prognosis in HCC. The expression of peritumoral DR/CK19 by immunohistochemistry, necroinflammation and fibrosis were assessed from 106 patients receiving curative resection for HCC. Prognostic values for these and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated.Results: Peritumoral DR significantly correlated with necroinflammation (r = 0.563, p = 3.4E-10), fibrosis (r = 0.435, p = 3.1E-06), AFP level (p = 0.010), HBsAg (p = 4.9E-4), BCLC stage (p = 0.003), TNM stage (p = 0.002), multiple nodules (p = 0.004), absence of tumor capsule (p = 0.027), severe microscopic vascular invasion (p = 0.031) and early recurrence (p = 0.010). Increased DR was significantly associated with decreased RFS/OS (p = 4.8E-04 and p = 2.6E-05, respectively) in univariate analysis and were identified as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 2.380, 95% CI = 1.250-4.534, p = 0.008 for RFS; HR = 4.294, 95% CI = 2.255-8.177, p = 9.3E-6 for OS) in multivariate analysis.Conclusions: These results suggested that peritumoral DR in a necroinflammatory microenvironment was a poor prognostic factor for HCC after resection. © 2014 Xu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84897497133	Transcription factor ERG is a specific and sensitive diagnostic marker for hepatic angiosarcoma	AIM: To investigate the expression of ERG, CD34, CD31 (PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1) and factor VIII-related antigen (FVIIIRAg) in the diagnosis of hepatic angiosarcoma patients. METHODS: Patient samples were collected from January 1986 to December 2012 from the People's Liberation Army General Hospital in Beijing, China. We obtained twenty-four samples of hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) that were confirmed by two pathologist. The samples were the result of three autopsy cases, eight biopsy cases and 13 patients who underwent surgical tumor removal. The HAS cases accounted for 2.23% (24/1075) of all hepatic vascular tumors at the hospital during the same time period. Patient histories including age, gender, clinical manifestations, medical treatments, laboratory tests, radiological images, histological observations and outcomes for each case were analyzed in detail. All samples were evaluated histologically with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression and localization of ERG was examined in all HAS specimens and compared to the known endothelial markers CD34, CD31 and FVIIIRAg. The endothelial markers were also evaluated in a panel of non-HAS tumors. RESULTS: This cohort of 24 HAS cases is, to the best of our knowledge, currently the largest cohort in the world in the publicly available literature. Hepatic angiosarcoma tissue samples were obtained from 14 males and 10 females with a mean age of 50.6 years (range: 7-86 years). The patients presented with the following clinical manifestations: abdominal pain (16/24), back pain (3/24), heart palpitations (1/20), cough (1/24) or no clinical symptoms (3/24). Tumors were predominantly localized in the right hepatic lobe (15/24) or left hepatic lobe (6/24), or a diffuse growth on the right and left hepatic lobes (3/24). Eleven patients underwent surgical resection (45.8%), two patients received a liver transplant (8.3%), eight patients received interventional therapy (33.3%) and three patients received no treatment (lesions discovered at autopsy, 12.5%). Postoperative follow-up of patients revealed that 87.5% (21/24) of patients had died and three cases were not able to be tracked. In all cases, the mean survival time was 12.1 mo. While 100% of the HAS samples were positive for ERG expression, expression of the other markers was more variable. CD31 was expressed in 79.2% (19/24) of samples, CD34 was expressed in 87.5% (21/24) of samples and FVIIIRAg was expressed in 41.7% (10/24) of samples. CONCLUSION: ERG is a more sensitive and specific diagnostic marker for hepatic angiosarcoma in comparison to CD31, CD34 and FVIIIRAg. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

84901501647	Prognostic and clinicopathological significance of glypican-3 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis	AIM: To investigate the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of glypican-3 (GPC3) overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Publications were searched using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database up to March 2013. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to screen eligible studies for meta-analysis. The hazard ratios (HRs) of the eligible studies were pooled using RevMan 5.2 software to evaluate the impact of GPC3 overexpression on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in HCC patients. The correlation between GPC3 expression and clinicopathological parameters of HCC was also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of five studies with 493 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The combined HRs indicated that GPC3 overexpression can predict poor OS (n = 362 in 3 studies, HR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.47-3.24, Z = 3.86, P = 0.0001) and DFS (n = 325 in 3 studies, HR = 2.05, 95%CI: 1.43-2.93, Z = 3.94, P < 0.0001) in HCC patients without heterogeneity. Egger's and Begg's tests were applied to detect publication bias, and the results showed that there was no evidence of publication bias detected in the OS studies (the P value for Egger's test was 0.216) or DFS studies (the P value for Egger's test was 0.488). The combined odds ratios (ORs) suggested that GPC3 expression tends to be associated with tumor vascular invasion (OR = 2.74, 95%CI: 1.15-6.52, P = 0.02), hepatic cirrhosis (OR = 2.10, 95%CI: 1.31-3.36, P = 0.002), poor tumor differentiation (OR = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.13-0.40, P < 0.00001) and advanced TNM stage (OR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.18-0.51, P < 0.00001). CONCLUSION: From this study, we conclude that GPC3 overexpression tends to be associated with a poor prognosis (poor OS or DFS) in HCC. © 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc. All rights reserved.

84901627546	Mesenchymal stem cells contribute to the chemoresistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in inflammatory environment by inducing autophagy	Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been reported to play an important role in tumor growth. Inflammation is an important feature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Certain inflammatory cytokines produced in tumor microenvironment modulate functional activities of MSCs. At the present time, however, the role of MSCs in the development of HCC cell resistance to chemotherapy in the inflammatory microenvironment during tumor growth has not yet been identified. Methods: MTT and PI/Annexin V-FITC assay were employed to examine the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cell lines. The expression of TGF-β are detected by Realtime PCR and Western blot. GFP tagged LC3 expression vector and electron microscopy are utilized to demonstrate the occurrence of autophagy. Results: We observed that MSCs pretreated with the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α induced resistance to chemotherapy in HCC cell lines in both the in vitro and in vivo circumstances. Following exposure to conditioned medium of MSCs that were pre-treated with IFN-γ plus TNF-α, HCC cell line cells underwent autophagy which serves as a protective mechanism for HCC cells to resist the cell toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. Treatment of HCC cell line cells with autophagy inhibitor effectively reversed the MSCs-induced resistance to chemotherapy in these cells. Stimulation with the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α provoked expression of TGF-β by MSCs. MSCs-induced chemoresistance in HCC cell lines was correlated with the up-regulation of TGF-β expression by MSCs. Knockdown of TGF-β expression by MSCs with siRNA attenuated MSCs-induced chemoresistance in HCC cells. Conclusions: These results suggest that increase in TGF-β expression by MSCs in the inflammatory microenvironment of HCC promotes the development of chemoresistance in HCC cells. © 2014 Han et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

84902287652	Clinical and pathological features of miR-10b and RHOC gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) was reported frequently in different human cancers. The major role of miRNA is targeting 3′-UTR of coding gene and causing translational repression or mRNA degradation. miR-10b overexpression was reported to promote breast cancer metastasis by up-regulating RHOC expression. But its expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Our study indicated that the expression of miR-10b was different in HCC and adjacent tissue samples, and reduced expression of miR-10b in HCC was related to vein invasion. High-level expression of RHOC was also related to vein invasion in HCC. But no correlation was found between miR-10b and RHOC expression. These results suggest that miR-10b and RHOC are independent predictors of HCC invasion and metastasis. © 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

84905877138	Evaluation of docetaxel- and oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in postgastrectomy gastric cancer patients reveals obvious survival benefits in docetaxel-treated mixed signet ring cell carcinoma patients	The purpose of this study was to determine the disease-free and overall survival (DFS and OS, respectively) in 991 postgastrectomy gastric cancer patients untreated (n = 372) or treated with either oxaliplatin-based (n = 376) or docetaxel-based (n = 243) chemotherapy and to identify prognostic factors that could help establish subgroups of patients who would benefit from such treatment. The median follow-up duration was 55.3 months (range 31.2–90.8 months). Subgroup analyses revealed that gastric adenocarcinoma (DFS 56.9 vs 53.2 months, P = 0.180, χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.802; OS not reached vs 70.7 months, P = 0.521, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.412), but not absolute signet ring cell (SRC) carcinoma (DFS 15.1/18.0 vs 10.1 months, P = 0.171/0.259, χ<sup>2</sup> = 1.874/1.275; OS 21.0/26.1 vs 20.5 months, P = 0.551/0.196, χ<sup>2</sup> = 0.355/1.674), patients undergoing either docetaxel- or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy had a lower risk of recurrence and increased survival in comparison to those without chemotherapy. In the mixed SRC carcinoma patients, DFS and OS of patients treated with docetaxel-based regimen had a longer survival (DFS 50.1 vs 29.9 months, P = 0.046, χ<sup>2</sup> = 3.987; OS not reached vs 48.6 months, P = 0.016, χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.854) and lower risk of recurrence and death (DFS HR 0.540, 95 % CI 0.355–0.874, P = 0.012; OS HR 0.452, 95 % CI 0.259–0.790, P = 0.005) than oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Cumulatively, our results indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy is beneficial and that docetaxel-based regimen should be considered for patients with mixed SRC carcinoma.

84907457916	Increased CDC20 expression is associated with development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma	Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) encodes a regulatory protein interacting with the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) in the cell cycle and plays important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of multiple tumors. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of CDC20 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the role of CDC20 in the progression of HCC. By bioinformatics analysis, CDC20 was found to be the major node in HCC molecular interaction networks. Quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were applied to examine CDC20 expression in 16 paired primary HCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine CDC20 protein expression in 132 matched paraffinembedded HCC tissues and to analyze the relationship between CDC20 staining and clinical characteristics. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CDC20 was synthesized and transfected into HepG2 cells to investigate the role of CDC20 in cell growth and the cell cycle. Results show that CDC20 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues. In the 132 matched HCC tissues, high expression levels of CDC20 were detected in 68.18% HCC samples, and overexpression of CDC20 was positively correlated with gender (P=0.013), tumor differentiation (P=0.000), TNM stage (P=0.012), P53 and Ki-67 expression (P=0.023 and P=0.007, respectively). Cells transfected with CDC20 siRNA showed a decrease in cell proliferation and increase in the number of cells in G2/M-phase. In conclusion, increased expression of CDC20 was demonstrated to be associated with the development and progression of HCC, and may be regarded as a promising therapeutic target for HCC.

84919329489	Expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule associated with elevated ductular reactions in hepatocellar carcinoma	Aim: To evaluate the prognostic significance of the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression in HCC, the relationship between EpCAM with ductular reactions and other clinical features. Methods: From 2001 to 2003, 106 HCC patients who underwent curative resection in Eastern Hepatobiliary Hospital were enrolled. The expression of EpCAM in tumoral tissues and ductular reactions in paired non-tumoral tissues was assessed by immunohistochemistry. EpCAM was evaluated with prognosis, ductular reactions and other clinical variables. Results: HCC expressing high level of EpCAM showed more aggressively than usual progressed HCC. High EpCAM expression was associated with poor overall survival and recurrence free survival. (. P=. 0.0005, 0.0019, respectively). A close association was found between tumoral EpCAM expression and peritumoral ductular reactions. Patients with high level of ductular reactions tended to have higher EpCAM expression than those with low level (. P=. 0.016). Conclusion: HCC stratification by EpCAM may reflect different prognosis. EpCAM expression correlated with ductular reactions may be a result of unregulated activation and differentiation blockage of progenitor cells.

0348134962	Tempero-spatial dissociation between the expression of Fas and apoptosis after coronary occlusion	Aims: To explore the role of Fas in cardiomyocytic apoptosis induced by ischaemia through determining the histological relation between Fas expression and apoptosis in rat myocardium during ischaemia/ infarction. Methods: The myocardial ischaemia model was produced by ligating the left coronary artery in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were killed from 10 minutes to seven days after surgery. Apoptotic myocardial cells were detected by the in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labelling method, and the expression of Fas by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Results: Cardiomyocytic apoptosis appeared from three to 36 hours after ischaemia. The expression of Fas could be detected by western blot from before surgery to seven days of ischaemia. Apoptosis and the expression of Fas in the cardiomyocytes appeared in different regions of the myocardium: apoptosis in the ischaemic region, Fas in the regions surrounding ischaemic myocardium. Conclusion: These results suggest that there is a tempero-spatial dissociation between the expression of Fas and apoptosis after coronary occlusion. Fas might not directly regulate the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes induced by ischaemia.
