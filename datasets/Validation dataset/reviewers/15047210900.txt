2942527393	Simulating cold production by a coupled reservoir-geomechanics model with sand erosion	A fully coupled reservoir-geomechanics model is developed to simulate the enhanced production phenomena both in heavy-oil reservoirs (i.e., Northwestern Canada) and conventional oil reservoirs (i.e., North Sea). The model is implemented numerically by fully coupling an extended geomechanics model to a two-phase reservoir flow model. A sand erosion model is postulated after the onset of sand production, which is determined based on the degree of plastic deformation inside the reservoir formation calculated by the coupled reservoir-geomechanics model. Both the enhanced oil production and the ranges of the enhanced or sanding zone are calculated, and the effect of solids production on oil recovery and enhancement are analyzed. Our studies indicate that the enhanced oil production can be the result of the combined effect of higher fluid velocity due to the movement of the sand particles according to a modified Darcy's flow and an effective permeability increase due to sand erosion. Another benefit from this process is that such an improvement in mobility may reduce the near well pressure gradient so that the sanding potential is reduced given a flow rate, and it permits a less sand-prone environment which is favorable for further sand control. In addition, two-phase flow can affect pressure gradient and formation residual cohesion due to capillary pressure change, which is also critical for sand control. Such an analogy can also be used for a completion strategy by allowing a certain amount of sand produced before a sand control strategy is implemented in a high flow-rate reservoir, when the optimum production is desirable, and when the reservoir productivity does not vitally rely on sand production. This article demonstrates the feasibility of such a model to simulate both sanding and enhanced oil production. Our initial attempt was to simulate the field performance in Northwestern Canada. As we were unable to match the field data using those input data for the onset of the stable sand production, we suggest that either new data is obtained for massive sand production (skeleton collapse), or such an erosion model should be used in the stable sanding period only, before the onset of massive sand production.

33750393418	Quantitative evaluation for excess pore pressure and wellbore stress around a cased well under steam injection	Based on the continuum mechanics theory, a coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical model corresponding to excess pore pressure and effective stress of thermal well under steam injection, was presented. In order to derive an effective numerical solution, a Galerkin finite element method with fully implicit and sequential iterative algorithm was adopted to design related computer codes. The numerical results show that excess pore pressure around cased well reaches 13.8 MPa when the heating rate reaches 46.82°C/d. Thereby the effective stress near the well approaches the maximum value of radial stress with 14 MPa, tangential stress with 9 MPa, respectively. Therefore, an optimum programming for warming time or heating rate in steam injection should include various factors such as thermal-hydraulic response, in-situ stress and the strength of casing structure.

34248337980	Sanding process and permeability change	This paper first presents a consistent mathematical framework to predict sand production volume, focusing on the coupling between hydro-mechanical factors, formation deformation and the resulting permeability change. Two types of sand production mechanisms are considered: production of coarse sands under mechanical failure and production of fine sands under hydro-dynamical erosion. The Drucker-Prager constitutive law with cap hardening is adopted to describe both dilative and collapsing deformation behaviour. The finite element method is used to solve the coupled governing equation system. After the model is validated with a field history case, it is used to compute two examples of wellbore pressure drawdown and the associated impact on the near-wellbore sanding process and permeability change. The calculation indicates that the permeability can be modified any time during the sanding. For example, under suitable reservoir depletion, the near-wellbore permeability can increase by 30%. However, more drastic pressure depletion under the otherwise identical in situ and operating conditions causes compaction near the wellbore and permeability decline by nearly 40%. Therefore, these simulated cases suggest that a balanced pressure depletion strategy should be used to manage the sand production.

The principle of the fracture-surface topography analysis (FRASTA) was used. In FRASTA, the fracture surfaces were scanned by laser microscope and the elevation data was recorded for analysis.

34948853703	Comparison of macro-scale and meso-scale elasto-plastic damage failure in rocks	In order to consider local plastic deformation with a mesoscopic view in rocks, an elasto-plastic damage constitutive model based on incremental theory was deduced in strain space, and the failure elements deleting method was used to simulate crack propagation in program so as to explicitly show how the cracks extend in rocks. The elasto-plastic damage and failure problem of mode I crack was studied at macro-scale level and meso-scale level respectively. The comparison indicates that the mode I crack extending accords with the theory of fracture mechanics at macro-scale level. The study on failure process of rocks at meso-scale level can explain meso-failure mechanism. And rock's macro failure was directly connected with meso damage and failure. The rock's failure process of 3-D numerical simulation was more complicated than that of 2-D simulation. The simulated result of marble's elasto-plastic damage failure agrees well with the experimental result of three point bending beam of marble, which proves that the meso-scale level model was suitable to simulate problems of rock's failure.

37449011815	Fluid-solid coupling model and its application in quantitative sand production prediction of oil and water wells	Willi fluid percolation-reservoir deformation or damage and other factors under consideration, a fluid-solid coupling model for predicting sand production volume is generated. Two types of sand production mechanisms are proposed; producing fine sands under hydro-dynamical erosion and producing coarse sands when reservoir structures are destructed. The matrix stress and the deformation of sandstone reservoirs in sand production are studied using the Drueker-Pragcr criterion. The results of finite element numerical simulation indicate that the change of formation permeability correlates closely with producing pressure drop and reservoir properties in the whole sand production. Under relative balanced pressure, because of the erosion of reservoirs and the destruction of reservoir skeleton structures, the formation permeability can increase by 30%; while under over high production pressure drop, because of the possible reservoir compaction near well-bores, the formation permeability can decline by 50%. A balanced pressure depletion strategy is the key to controlling permeability declining and retaining production.

77954528629	Application of reservoir-fracture composed element to deliverability simulation for hydraulic fracturing well	The mechanics characteristics of reservoir and fracture after hydraulic fracturing were simulated by using reservoir-fracture composed element. Based on finite element method, a composed reservoir-fracture element model was established to analyze the fractured well deliverability. The mass and the stiffness matrixes of the fracture element were transformed to the whole system of coordinates, which can reflect the effect of production formance on productivity. The results show that the problem of reservoir-fracture mesh size matching was solved by reservoir-fracture composed element. Using the reaction method to compute the production, the computing error of solving pressure gradient in high flow conductivity fracture was avoided, and the operating speed and accuracy of solving fractured well deliverability were improved. This model can contribute to the performance simulation and design optimization of fractured well.

84861610854	Inflow performance for slanted wells in anisotropic reservoirs considering wellbore pressure drop	The inflow performance prediction is very important to completion optimization of slanted wells. A reservoir/wellbore coupling model for slanted wells in anisotropic parallelepiped reservoirs considering wellbore pressure drop is presented based on source function method and superposition principle and solution methodology is described. On this basis, the inflow behavior of a slanted well in an anisotropic, infinite slab reservoir with impermeable top and bottom boundaries is investigated. Potential drop in the wellbore can cause flux difference, which is greatest under isotropic, and decreases with vertical anisotropy. Well productivity decreases with vertical anisotropy and the decrease is more significant for larger inclination angles than for smaller ones. Well inclination angle has a greater influence on inflow performance of wells in higher-anisotropy reservoirs than in lower-anisotropy ones and should be determined cautiously in the reservoir engineering design. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.

Several factors including multiphase flow, pressure drop, variable mass flow and reservoir heterogeneity, are taken into consideration in this method. By the new technology, Steam injection string used in horizontal wells is divided into several independent units through applying matching equipments. Based on the optimization of steam absorption capacity of every unit, steam injection profile distribution is improved. The validation of multipoint steam injection technology and matching equipments are verified through ground simulation tests in this paper.

84867068359	Advances in orthogonal cutting models	For the obvious economic and technical importance of machining, the development of theoretical models to predict physical behavior during metal cutting could be of significant importance, which would lead to optimizations to machining parameters and improvements to productivity. This has been a major preoccupation within the machining research community, and numerous classical orthogonal cutting models have been proposed during the past decades. However, the cutting process is extremely complex, and the existing models can't satisfy the requirements to predict the cutting process accurately. Thus, summarizing and understanding the existing cutting models has enlightening and guiding effects to create more reliable and accurate models. Following a systematic review of the representative orthogonal cutting models that developed in the recent decades, the works of Merchant, Piispanen, Shaw, Lee & Shaffer, Hill, Fang, Oxley and Atkins are concentratedly introduced. The main theories and achievements of each model and the relationships between them are commented. At last, the development direction of orthogonal cutting models is further discussed.

64849093503	The ale method for oil/water two-phase flow in deforming porous media	The main objective of this paper is to establish a consistent geometrical frame focusing on the coupling between hydro-mechanical aspects. An arbitrary Lagrangian and Eulerian method (ALE) has been used to deal with the numerical simulation for oil/water flow in deforming porous media. When the mesh motion is equal to the velocity of the deformed porous media, the convection term referred to as the relative velocity between fluid flow and the skeleton deformation is removed from the Finite Element Method (FEM) formula. Therefore, some difficulty in FEM numerical simulation has been solved. A classical oil/water flow coupled with solid deformation is simulated by ALE code with an iterative scheme. An ALE with a fully implicit and sequential iterative algorithm [Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (IMPES) method], which calculates the oil phase pressure and water phase saturation with least squares FEM, is used to simulate the oil/water two-phase fluid flow. Compared with general reservoir simulation, the ALE method could reach a consistent frame description or a more rigorous definition of the parameters for the solid phase and the flow phase. This may be very important for larger deformations in stratum induced by petroleum production and tracking the moving interface in multi-phase fluid flow.

First, according to the influencing factors of steam stimulation, the factor set and evaluation set are established; then the membership degree of the qualitative index and quantitative index to assessment grades is decided, and the single factor fuzzy relation matrix is established; Moreover, based on the influence degree of each factor on steam stimulation, the weighting set is also given. Finally, the secondary fuzzy compressive evaluation is conducted. Based on the secondary fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model, the steam stimulation effect for a well is predicted.

70350728676	Field experiments and FEM analysis of third-party damaged oil transmission pipeline	Oil transmission pipelines are often drilled by oil stealers in China. These drilled pipelines must be repaired or replaced. The replace of a segment of a pipeline is costly and time-consuming. At the same time, it is necessary to stop transmission when replacing the pipeline. It is almost impossible because such damages are too frequent. In order to save time and cost, to repair the pipeline by welding is widely used. But the strength of the pipeline was badly hurt because of these third-party damages by stealers. Whether the pipeline can work normally after being damaged is in concern. This paper details a series of experiments on such pipelines. The strains of some selected positions were measured and the deduced stress results were analyzed. Further FEM analysis was performed and results were compared to the experimental ones. The extent of the strength degradation by such damages were thus concluded. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that the earth pressure at the pipe surface is extremely nonuniform, and the main influence range of impaction on the surface earth pressure is near the top of the pipe. The main influence range is determined by the real contact area in impaction. The mass and velocity of rock-fall are the primary factors influencing the maximal soil pressure on pipe surface. The influence range of impaction is approximate twice as large as the radius of impact area. If the rock-fall has the same impacting velocity, the mass of block has more influence on the damage of pipeline than the contact area, and the thicker covering soil could give pipe better protection under impacting loads. In comparison with using stiff clay as backfill soil, the pipe could produce more deformation than with sand backfilling under impact loading.

Hydraulic pressure tests were performed for these three segments respectively. The test method, test procedure and test results will be fully discussed. Furthermore, FEM analysis was performed for the first and the second segment and results were analyzed in this paper. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The tensile stress increases with pore fluid pressure increasing. Effective stress change by temperature, pressure significantly is an important factor resulting to formation instability near wellbore region.

79952570467	Relationship between the evolution of reservoir-induced seismicity in space-time and the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration - A case study of Zipingpu reservoir	In order to know the dynamic response mechanism of reservoir-induced seismicity (RIS) during the process of reservoir storage impounding, this paper established a quantitative mathematical model for RIS study, and took Zipingpu reservoir as an example, detailedly studied the geological structures and hydrogeologic conditions in the reservoir area, analyzed RIS evolution characteristics in space-time. On the basis of those works, we calculated the dynamic changes of elastic additional stress field, effective additional stress field, pore pressure and fault stability based on finite element method; the relationship between the evolution of RIS in spacetime and the process of reservoir water body loading-unloading and water infiltration was discussed. Our study shows that; (1) The mathematical model for RIS is divided into two levels in this paper: One is the rock-mass distortion and stability influenced by liquid seepage in porous rock media, which is described in solid-liquid coupling model; the other is a fault-related quantitative model for RIS, which is described by the linkage between additional reservoir water pressure diffusion along the faults and the change of Coulomb failure stress on fault plane. The combination of two forms of modeling approach will provide a comparatively macro-mechanical framework for RIS quantitative study; (2) Fault permeability structure has an important influence on mechanical response of faults under a changing pore pressure. At deep depths of these faults, there may be a new type of permeability structure for the main faults in the study area, which is water-conductive in hanging wall strata and water-resisting in footwall strata. The difference of infiltration stability of the deep rock-masses brings on the RIS depending on lithology condition; (3) After Zipingpu reservoir storage impounding, the small earthquakes showed the characteristics of banded distribution, cluster distribution, and seismic migration; the source depth of small earthquakes preponderantly distributed in the depth range of 4∼10 km, and the activity in the deep pooling area of Tongjichang fault and Anxian-Guanxian fault was most intensive. Meanwhile, the small earthquakes mainly occurred in the carbonate rock-masses with high brittle lithology and low infiltration stability, but there were few earthquakes in the Triassic Xujiahe sand mudstone and coal measure strata which was relatively weak in lithology and high in infiltration stability. In terms of response speed, the small earthquakes in the southwest and northeast seismic cluster area of the reservoir may belong to "rapid response type", and the Dujiangyan small seismic swarm may fall into "delayed response" induced seismicity; (4) RIS was closely related to changes of effective additional stress in the rock-mass under the reservoir body. In the mainly compressional tectonic stress environment, the result of reservoir water body loading commonly trends to enhance fault stability, while the effect of additional water pressure diffusion tends to promote fault instability. It is a dynamic process, in which two contradicting effects restrict and balance each other, that controls the orientation of Coulomb failure stress change, and determines the characteristics of RIS evolution.

However, the theoretical mechanism and the features of turbulent spots in the process of the transition in a boundary layer with pressure gradient have not yet been clarified, thus needs to be further explored. A physical mode of the formation of turbulent spots in the boundary layer with pressure gradient, which is a small initial disturbance field induced by local impulse at the wall, is presented in the paper. Using direct numerical simulation, we study the physical mechanism and evolution of the formation of turbulent spots in the boundary layer with pressure gradient. The numerical results are consistent with characteristics of turbulent spots in many respects.

The FEM simulation was validated using experimental results and good agreement was obtained. The simulation results indicate that the transition from continuous to saw-tooth chip formation is favored by increases in cutting speed and uncut chip thickness and a decrease in tool rake angle. The existence of Salomon's assumption was further discussed, which shows that the Salomon's assumption is not valid for the tool-chip interface temperature, but could be true for the surface temperature of the workpiece. In addition, decreasing the uncut chip thickness leads to an increase of the specific cutting energy, which could be primarily caused by an increase in the shear strength of the workpiece material due to a decrease in the PSZ temperature. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

83655183809	Uplift response of large-diameter buried pipeline in liquefiable soil using pipe-soil coupling model	Buried pipelines are vulnerable to damage caused by flotation as the soil liquefies during an earthquake. In this paper, in order to analyze the cross-sectional deformation of large-diameter and thin-wall (1016×21mm) buried pipeline under liquefaction-induced uplift force, a comprehensive three-dimensional pipe-soil coupling model, based on pipe-soil Interaction and thin shell theory, is developed. Utilizing the model, uplift response of buried pipeline under different conditions are simulated and the effects of several important parameters including width of liquefied zone, ratio of diameter to thickness (D/t), burial depth, and strength of soil spring are studied. The results show that the maximum ovality ration and strain of pipeline under liquefaction-induced uplift force increases with increasing width of liquefied zone, soil spring strength, burial depth and ration of diameter to thickness. Width of liquefied zone and soil spring strength are critical parameters, which have large effect on deformation of buried pipeline, however, the ratio of diameter to thickness and burial depth of pipeline affect the uplift response of pipeline slightly. According to the results obtained, some useful suggestions for the design of large-diameter buried pipelines in liquefiable soil are given. © 2011 ASCE.

High-speed cutting experiments were performed on AISI 1045 steels. The investigation of chip morphology, micro-structures, micro-hardness and the finished surface integrity were carried out, focusing on the physical phenomena accompanying the saw-tooth chip formation. The results reveal that, with increasing the cutting speed, the transition of chip morphology from continue to saw-tooth could be attributed to repeated thermoplastic shear-banding rather than periodic cracking. In particular, a severe material flow leading to mass transfer of heat was observed at very high cutting speed. The effect of mass transfer of heat on thermoplastic shear instability was further investigated, which implies that the mass transfer of heat would retard the formation of saw-tooth chip. Finally, the influence of cutting speed and mass transfer on the temperature distribution during high speed machining was briefly discussed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For this reason, the model for evaluating the stability of the unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs is established by applying the theory of continuum medium mechanics, in which the seepage of fluid and the deformation and collapse of solid reservoir are considered. The changes of the reservoir stress, deformation and permeability near the wellbore are simulated using finite element method. The simulation result shows that hole curvature and producing pressure drop are the main factors influencing the stability of the unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs near the holebore. Therefore, the critical producing pressure drop should be determined according to the lithology of the developed reservoirs.

Analytical characterization for orthogonal cutting process is obtained, which can give the explicit expressions for the shear angle, cutting force, and chip thickness in terms of the tool geometry, the friction coefficients on the tool flat, and the internal friction angle of the materials. To investigate the effect of the material and cutting parameters on cutting process, the finite element simulation is performed as well. The comparisons between the shear angle and cutting force predicted by the theoretical model with those obtained from finite element model simulation are made. The good agreement of the predicted results with the numerical results clearly reveals that the proposed slip-line field model can satisfactorily characterize the orthogonal cutting behavior of the pressure sensitive materials. Further analysis has demonstrated that the pressure sensitivity of materials has a significant influence on cutting process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

For a highly deviated well producing at a constant rate in an infinite slab reservoir of impermeable top and bottom boundaries, when the equivalent permeability and other parameters are constant, the smaller the anisotropy ratio, the shorter the duration of early-time radial flow and intermediate-time transition flow, and the earlier the appearance of late-time pseudo radial flow is.

The results show that, the strain and strain rate dependences of material flow stress have no effect on "size effect", while the thermal-softening effect plays a dominant role in causing "size effect". In addition, the "size effect" can be attributed to a drop in the primary shear zone temperature and an increase in the tool-chip contact length.

The validity of the model was tested and verified by comparing with other traditional models. On this basis, an inflow performance model of highly deviated wells was developed according to the coupling between reservoir flow and wellbore flow. The solution method was also presented. Using this model, the inflow performance of a highly deviated well with constant rate in an infinite slab reservoir with impermeable top and bottom boundaries was analyzed. The results show that the effects of deviation angle and reservoir thickness are the least during early-time radial flow period, increase gradually during intermediate-time transition flow period, and eventually stabilize during late-time pseudo radial flow period. The thicker the reservoir and the greater the inclination angle, the smaller the bottom-hole potential drawdown. The thinner the reservoir and the greater the inclination angle, the larger the end effect. The boundary effect is the main reason leading to the difference of inflow performance between highly deviated wells and horizontal wells.

On this basis, a production profile model for horizontal wells in anisotropic box-shaped reservoirs was proposed and a profile control method using variable-density perforations aiming at uniform recovery was presented. The pressure adjustment range and influencing factors were analyzed quantitatively. The results show that the smaller the perforation density and depth, the larger the pressure adjustment range. After optimization, perforation density in low-permeability zone is bigger than that in high-permeability zone. With the increase of near-well permeability variability, the profile balance deteriorates, and the perforation density range increases. The smaller the perforation density, the greater the impact of rounding error, and the less satisfactory the profile control.

84866247772	Perforation optimization for regulating production profile of horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoirs	Horizontal wells which are characterized by large drainage area, small pressure drawdown and high production rate are more influenced by reservoir heterogeneity and wellbore pressure loss than vertical wells. These factors may lead to unequilibrium development and premature water breakthrough, resulting in shortened production period, reduced production and ultimate recovery. Perforated completion is a widely used completion technology of horizontal wells. As the only flow channel between the formation and the wellbore, perforation plays an important role on the inflow performance. This paper aims to develop a perforation optimization method for regulating production profile of horizontal wells in heterogeneous reservoirs. Based on an improved evaluation approach of permeability heterogeneity, a reservoir/wellore coupling model of perforated horizontal wells in heterogeneous, anisotropic parallelepiped reservoirs is presented, and hence a perforation density optimization method aiming at regulating production profile is proposed. The example optimization shows that, the lower perforation density has a wider pressure regulating range. With the increase of perforation length, both the converged pressure drop and pressure regulating range decrease. To obtain an ideal production profile, the perforation density in low-permeability region should be higher than that in high-permeability region. The stronger the near-well permeability variability, the greater the density range and the proportion of low density are. The smaller the density, the greater the impact of rounding error is, and hence the less satisfactory the regulating effect is. This study provides a theoretical basis for the perforated completion design of horizontal wells in heterogeneous, anisotropic reservoirs. Copyright 2012, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

84866540763	Energy principle for pitting evolution during anodic dissolution stress corrosion	As an irreversible thermodynamics process, the development and evolution of pitting for anodic dissolution stress corrosion is controlled by the combined action of surface energy, elastic energy and electrochemical energy stored in the solid. Based on energy principle, the exploratory study of energy issues for stress corrosion pitting evolution was carried on. A two-variable semi-ellipsoid model was proposed to describe the pitting evolution, and the function of pitting shape parameter was derived in the process of stress corrosion. At the same time, the effects of far-field stress and other parameters on the pitting shape parameter and the variation of system energy were discussed. The results show that the pitting morphology initially appears as a hemisphere and evolves into a semi-ellipsoid gradually. The evolution morphology of pitting is controlled by the combined action of strain energy and surface energy stored in the system. The strain energy can accelerate the morphology pitting evolution, while the surface energy resists it. At the same time, the far-field stress has a significant influence on the variation of thermodynamic potential.

84869043561	Modeling periodic adiabatic shear band evolution during high speed machining Ti-6Al-4V alloy	Cutting experiments were performed on Ti-6Al-4V alloy over a wide range of cutting speeds. The transition of chip morphology from continuous to serrated is observed with increasing the cutting speeds, which is found to be ascribed to a periodic shear band formation that caused by thermo-plastic instability occurred within the primary shear zone (PSZ). Further microscopic observations reveal that the spacing of these periodic shear bands, i.e.; the segment spacing, is significantly related to the evolution degree of shear band which increases with increasing the cutting speed. Since the segment spacing is the most important parameter to characterize the chip serration, to predict the segment spacing is fundamentally useful for the understating of serrated chip formation mechanism. However, the complicated conditions of high speed machining (HSM) give rise to greater difficulties for the prediction of segment spacing, and there is still no theoretical prediction has yet considered the effect of shear band evolution. In this work, by analyzing the plastic deformation within the PSZ, and taking into account the evolution of shear band as well as the material convection caused by chip flow, a new theoretical model is developed to predict the segment spacing, in which the momentum diffusion due to unloading within the shear band had been considered. The predictions of this model were compared with the experimental and simulated results, which clearly reveal that the proposed model can satisfactorily capture the process of chip segmentation over a wide range of cutting speeds. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

84869102171	Numerical simulation of 2D shallow water equation in arbitrary curvilinear coordinates	The problems with complex boundary shapes, such as natural river channels, lakes, estua-ries and bays, were solved by using the boundary curve fitting methods. Arbitrary orthogonal curvilinear grid was established to overcome the computational difficulties caused by those complex boundaries. Then, a set of derived equations in the arbitrary curvilinear coordinates, including 2D shallow water equation, turbulence kinetic energy equation and dissipation rate equation etc. were numerically discreted by the finite difference method. In addition, the 2D shallow water equation was numerically solved within the computational domain by using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) difference scheme. In order to verify the reliability and correctness of the method, the De Vriend's 180° plane curve flume experiment model was adopted as an example to implement the numerical simulations. Finally, the simulation outcomes are in excellent agreement with that experimental results with a maximum error as large as approximate 10

84869838932	Dynamic responses of buried pipelines under impact loading caused by landslide	Cases of pipeline damage caused by landslide are common in coastal or mountainous regions, where the design of buried pipelines should be improved in order to reduce the risk of damage or failure. Dynamic responses of large diameter thin wall steel pipes under impact loading were analyzed using a nonlinear contact model of pipe-soil coupling in this paper. Several influence factors were studied, such as the impact velocity of rockfall, buried depth of pipeline, ratio of diameter to thickness and style of soil. The results show that an ellipsoid induces much more impact force than a sphere which has the same volume, and the larger one in volume have greater impact force for two spheres. Dangerous compressive areas of pipeline occupy 1/6 of the whole area, so the pipelines subject to landslide occur local failure. Based on results, some useful suggestions for the design of pipelines in landslide region are given. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84874498014	Choices of fictitious densities and time step in dynamic relaxation method	Using the dynamic relaxation method, the static problem can be converted into a dynamic one. It can be solved in an explicit iterative scheme. The convergence rate can be accelerated by setting fictitious densities. The problem that how fictitious densities affect the convergence time step and the final result was studied. The factor affecting convergence rate was defined as the ratio of time step. In consideration of node movement, the scheme to set effective densities and time step was proposed. A program using deformable discrete element method was coded to validate the conclusions. The results show that nodes positions are not related to their densities. It is important to keep different elements hold the same convergence time step by setting different densities in fictitious densities method. Setting time step and fictitious densities by the proposed scheme, the convergence rate can be largely accelerated.

84874872245	Study on crack tip field of shape memory alloy boardunder torsion load	This paper focuses on the thermo-mechanical behaviors of the shape memory alloy board with a crack and under the torsion load. A stress field equation from mechanics of elasticity is used to describe the stress distribution around the crack tip in the shape memory alloy board. A martensitic phase transition equation is supposed to predict the martensitic phase transition behaviors of the field near the crack tip in the shape memory alloy board. The martensitic phase transition zones near the crack tip in the shape memory alloy board under the torsion load are numerically described based on the stress field equation and martensitic phase transition equation at various temperatures. Results show that the stress field equation and martensitic phase transition equation can predict the thermo-mechanical behaviors of the shape memory alloy board with a crack and under the torsion load effectively. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

Forming mechanism of coherent structures agrees well withDNS results. A close relationship has been found between the evolutional characteristics and factorssuch as the magnitude and structural distribution of the wall local impulse, and the amount ofenergy and the length of loading time that the initial local impulse disturbance introduces into thewall region. Moreover, these parameters play key roles in the formation of coherent structures nearwall of a turbulent boundary layer. So, the wall local impulse disturbance provides the origins forinducing the formation of coherent structures in wall region of a turbulent boundary layer. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84876430067	Experimental study on re-fracturing in defective reservoirs	The distributions of fractures after re-fracturing in defective reservoirs are studied by using a series of large size true tri-axial test systems for the first time. The experimental results show that the stress redirection has a great impact on the distribution of new cracks. When the load reaches a certain critical value, defects will be activated during hydraulic fracturing, and more complex fractures will be formed. Whether new fractures propagate along the preset fracture or not largely depends on the stress state, geological conditions, and so on. Especially under the higher uniform stress, the direction of new fractures has nothing to do with the preset ones.

84878868847	Parameter control methods for the pumping toolstring composed of perforating gun and fracturing plug in a horizontal well	According to the technological characteristics of the combination perforation and multistage fracturing using drillable bridging plugs, both the hydrodynamics model of wireline sealing system and the mechanical model of toolstring running in the hole were developed. In these models, the equations governing the sealing pressure of grease injection, structure parameters of toostring and pump rate were established. Based on the presented models, the parameter control methods of pumping and their primary influence factors were investigated through case study. For a development well in low-permeability reservoir, the control methods and the reasonable ranges of grease injection sealing pressure, minimum weight and maximum length of toolstring and pump rate were defined using the control equations. The effects of wellhead pressure, hole configuration and running velocity of wireline on parameter controlling were also analyzed. The results show that, with increasing wellhead pressure, the grease injection rate should be increased to improve sealing pressure, and the minimum weight of toolstring should also increase. Increasing the overall angle change rate could lead to a decrease of the maximum allowable length of the toolstring. The pump rate should be adjusted according to the running velocity of wireline.

The media existing primary cracks was divided by elements. The unit and unit interface were calculated using the finite element and discrete element method, respectively. The continuum was converted into discontinuum by transformation of connection types between elements. The contacts were detected using the half-spring method in plane. The motion equation was solved in an explicit iterative scheme. Updating the coordinates of elements, the process of crack propagation was simulated. The simulation results of a single crack and en echelon cracks under uniaxial compression were contrasted with experimental results. The results show that the process of crack propagation can be effectively simulated using the combined finite-discrete element method. The en echelon cracks with 90° rock bridge under uniaxial compression were linked by wing cracks.

84881340842	A numerical model for evaluating permeability and porosity damage of dry sandstone	In this paper, the evolution equations of porosity and permeability of dry sandstone are discussed and the numerical model for evaluating perforating damage is developed. With application of dynamic program LS-DYNA, the dynamic responses of dry sandstone around the tunnel are simulated, and the distribution of radial porosity and permeability are mapped. The results show that porosity values are even somewhat higher near the tunnel than that of the undamaged average porosity far away from the tunnel. In addition, permeability values of sandstone in crushed zone reduce significantly, which impairs the flow performance of reservoir severely. Furthermore, the more distance from the entrance of the tunnel, the smaller the reducing amplitude of crushed zone thickness, porosity values and permeability values will be. Moreover, as the shock load intensity increases or the strength of rock decreases, the damage degree will be more severe. © 2013 by CESER Publications.

84896920044	Evaluation of perforating damage for sandstone	Based on the sensitivity analysis of deformation rate effect on porosity evolution, the mechanical model for evaluating perforating damage of sandstone was developed. Combining with mechanical parameters at different time, which were obtained by dynamic response analysis of sandstone around the perforation tunnel, the distributions of radial porosity and permeability were studied. Then, the perforating damage degree was evaluated. The results were compared with experimental data, and the validity of the evaluation method was proved to be effective. The results also show that the porosity near the tunnel is even somewhat higher than undamaged average porosity because of crushing of grains or tensile fractures around the perforation wall. In addition, porosity and permeability of sandstone in crushed zone reduce significantly, which impairs the flow performance of perforating tunnel severely. Furthermore, the more distance from the entrance of the tunnel, the smaller the reducing amplitude of crushed zone thickness, porosity and permeability will be. When the shock load intensity increases or the strength of sandstone decreases, the damage degree will be severe.

84899754461	Numerical simulation on the changes of elastic wave velocities of rocks under reservoir bottom during water storage and drainage	In order to know to what degree can elastic wave velocity be influenced by effective stress changes in rock medium at the bottom of reservoir, and the quantitative relationship between changes of elastic wave velocity, pore pressure and effective stress during the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration, pre-works have been done on the geological structures and hydrogeologic conditions in the Zipingpu reservoir, Sichuan Province, and its adjacent areas in detail, and a mathematical model was deduced which could describe rock-mass distortion and stability influenced by liquid seepage in porous rock media during the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration. On this basis the paper makes a further study to establish a quantitative mathematical model to describe the relationship between elastic wave velocity and effective stress, and also taking Zipingpu reservoir as an example, calcutates the dynamic changes of pore pressure, additional elastic effective stress, and elastic wave velocity using finite element method. The simulation results show that: the change in incremental value of elastic wave velocity during the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration is not obvious, the maximum amplitude is only about ±0.013 km/s, and changes mainly concentrate in local areas above 5 km depth under the reservoir bottom. The change in incremental value of elastic wave velocity is associated with changes of additional effective stress, similar to reservoir water-level fluctuation in curve shapes. Incremental value of elastic wave is related to location, depth, and additional effective stress of different observation points. The velocity change of P-wave is greater than S-wave at the same observation point. The time sequence changes of elastic wave velocity obtained by this paper are generally similar to the relative velocity variations of the Zipingpu reservoir region obtained by other scholars using seismic ambient noise method, but the variation range is slightly different.

High-order and high-resolution compact finite difference scheme and upwind compact finite difference scheme for nonlinear terms were used as spatial discretization, and the time integration was accomplished by 4th-order modified Runge-Kutta scheme. To verify the numerical method, the same physical parameters of De Vriend's 180° curved channel test were used in the simulation. The results show that, the new numerical results are closer to the experimental data than the results calculated by using SIMPLEC. The maximum relative error between numerical and experimental average velocity results is less than 3%. It is proved that the numerical method presented is feasible and rational. To sum up, it is an efficient, feasible and rational way to numerically solve hydrodynamic problems, and can be used in many engineering computations of territorial waters as natural rivers, open channels and lakes with arbitrary complex boundaries.

84903976083	Critical cutting speed for onset of serrated chip flow in high speed machining	The transition of continuously smooth chip flow to periodically serrated chip flow as the cutting speed increasing is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in high speed machining. Here, an explicit expression of the critical cutting speed for the onset of serrated chip flow, which is given in terms of material properties, uncut chip thickness and tool rake angle, is achieved based on dimensional analysis and numerical simulations. It could give reasonable predictions of the critical cutting speeds at which chips change from continuous to serrated for various metallic materials over wide ranges of uncut chip thickness and tool rake angle. More interestingly, it is found that, as the turbulent flow is controlled by the Reynolds number, the transition of the serrated chip flow mode is dominated by a Reynolds thermal number. Furthermore, the influences of material properties on the emergence of serrated chip flow are systematically investigated, the trends of which show good agreement with Recht's classical model. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

84908077978	3D-poreelastic finite element numerical simulation of Longtan reservoir-induced seismicity	In order to know the dynamic response mechanism of reservoir-induced seismicity (RIS), this paper has established the quantitative mathematical model and taken the Longtan reservoir as an example, established a 3D-poreelastic finite element model according to geologic structure, deep velocity structure and digital elevation of the reservoir area, calculated the dynamic changes of pore pressure, effective additional normal stress, shear stress and Coulomb failure stress in the faults and rocks at bottom of the reservoir during the process of reservoir storage impounding. Combined with the characteristics of seismic activity in the temporal and spatial distribution of the reservoir area after impoundment, the relationship between the evolution of RIS in space-time and the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration, and their possible mechanism have been discussed. Our study shows that: (1) After impoundment of the reservoir in September 30, 2006, seismic activity level around the Longtan reservoir obviously enhanced, and earthquakes mainly concentrated in 5 flooded deepwater areas, that are Luotuo (Cluster I), Bamao (Cluster II), Lalang (Cluster III), Dam head (Cluster IV) and Buliu River (Cluster V) earthquake clusters. The above areas were also the most obviously increasing areas of ΔCFS during the process of reservoir water body load-unloading and water infiltration, but there were seldom earthquakes in the shadow area of ΔCFS. It indicates that there exists closely relationship between variation of ΔCFS and reservoir seismic activities after the impoundment of the Longtan reservoir. (2) Numerical simulation results show that those faults, which have better permeability and directly hydraulic connection with the reservoir, are the superior channels for additional water head pressure diffusion, through those channels, the affection of additional head pressure diffusion can almost reaches deep into 13 km under the ground, and those strata dominated by carbonate from Sinian to Paleozoic become main layer to receive the head pressure. The above results are consistent with the characteristics that focal depths around the Longtan reservoir have been totally less than 13 km and dominantly distributed in 5~10 km since impoundment. It indicates that pore pressure reduces the shear strength of rocks and partially offsets the effect of confining pressure, so rock mass at those layer are prone to induce seismicity. (3) Whether it is deep or shallow, there exists the vast majority of time overlaps between the intervals of earthquake occrence frequently and the intervals of ΔCFS rising acceleratedly or in high value stage. This maybe indicate that, being influenced by the rapid increase of external loading rate, rocks and faults at the bottom of the reservoir are more prone to become unstable. Meanwhile, the difference of seismic responding time, frequency and magnitude between the deep and the shallow may be related to inhomogeneity of mechanical properties and permeability in different strata. (4) There exists different physical and mechanical mechanism of RIS in the Longtan reservoir: Cluster I, II, III maybe have something to do with the effect of reservoir body gravity loading, pore pressure diffusing and water infiltration weakening; Cluster IV are mainly controlled by the action of reservoir body gravity loading, and the pore pressure diffusion and water infiltration weakening action does not play a leading role; Cluster V is mainly affected by the pore pressure diffusion and water infiltration weakening effect, the body gravity loading effect maybe hold down the seismicity in a certain extent.
