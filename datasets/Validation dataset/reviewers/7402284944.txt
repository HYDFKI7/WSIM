84928817231	Ultrasound effects on chondrocyte apoptosis and the expressions of caspase-8 and caspase-3	Background: Ultrasound therapy can relieve pain and improve the movement function in patients with knee osteoarthritis, but there lacks of consistency in the literatures of ultrasound therapy. Objective: To further identify the effectiveness of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Twenty-four rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: normal group, model group and ultrasound group. The rabbit in the normal group received no intervention; rabbits in the model group received anterior cruciate ligament transaction to establish the knee osteoarthritis model without any treatment; the rabbit in the ultrasound group received ultrasound therapy after modeling for 10 minutes once time, once per day, 0.3 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 MHz and treated for 10 times. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was conducted for histological observation of rabbit articular cartilage; western blot and reverse transcription PCR assessment were used to assess the expressions of caspases-3 and caspases-8 in rabbit articular cartilage, while Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling was used to assess the ratio of chondrocytes apoptosis of rabbit knee articular cartilage. Results and Conclusion: The normal rabbit cartilage tissues and chondrocytes were neatly arranged in column; the middle cartilage layer of the model was thin; the chondrocytes were arranged disorderly and became less. After ultrasound therapy, the chondrocytes were rearranged neatly, and the number was increased. Compared with the normal group, the Mankin scores in the model group and ultrasound group were higher; the apoptotic rate of chondrocytes was higher in the model group and ultrasound group than in the normal group, and was also higher in the model group than in the ultrasound group. Compared with the normal group, the expressions of caspases-3 and caspases-8 were higher in the model group and the ultrasound group, while decreased after ultrasound therapy. The results indicate that ultrasound can improve the structure of cartilage tissues, decrease the expressions of caspases-3 and caspases-8 and reduce the apoptosis rate of chondrocytes. It is effective for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis with ultrasound therapy.

84930061374	Whole body vibration training improves limb motor dysfunction in stroke patients: Lack of evidence	BACKGROUND: Whole body vibration training, a recently developed method of neuromuscular training, is a useful method to improve muscle strength and postural control in the elderly. Recently, researchers attempt to explore whether whole body vibration training can reduce motor dysfunction for stroke patients. OBJECTIVE: To summarize clinical progress in whole body vibration treatment on stroke patients with limb motor dysfunction, including muscle strength of the affected limbs, muscle tension, balance and gait. METHODS: PubMed, EBSCO, Medline database were searched for articles relate to whole body vibration training intervention for stroke patients with motor dysfunction published from January 2002 to June 2014. Finally, 34 articles were included in result analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Whole body vibration training is feasible and safe for stroke patients has the feasibility and safety. For therapeutic efficacy, we focus on the muscle strength, muscle tone, balance, posture control ability, but there is no sufficient evidence to support that the whole body vibration training can improve the motor dysfunction. There is also no recognized standard on specific intervention protocols, such as vibration type, treatment frequency, treatment amplitude, treatment time. Many researchers aim to observe the clinical curative effect at present, but rarely explore the intervention mechanism of the whole body vibration. Further large-sample, multi-center randomized controlled experiments are required to test the validity.

84940352266	Exercise in the treatment of osteoporosis	Background: Osteoporosis is a condition resulting in an increased risk of skeletal fractures due to a reduction in bone mass and degradation in bone microstructure. Treatment of osteoporosis usually involves the application of pharmacological agents as the first choice. Pharmacotherapy alone is not sufficient for the comprehensive management of osteoporosis, as pharmacotherapy has no effect on increasing muscle strength, improving balance ability, and preventing falls. Exercise, considered as an important non-pharmacologic therapy, plays a considerable role in the prevention of osteoporosis. The importance of therapeutic exercises in the treatment of osteoporosis has been recognized gradually. Objective: To discuss the effect of exercise in the treatment of osteoporosis combined with some of the latest research literatures. Methods: Clinical reports and mechanism researches about effects of different types of exercise on bone strength especially the treatment of osteoporosis were retrieved from CNKI database and Medline database with the key words of "osteoporosis, bone mineral density, bone strength, treatment, exercise, stress, tai chi, muscle, bone architecture" in both Chinese and English from January 2001 to February 2013. The repetitive researches and atypical reports were eliminated. Resutls and Conclusion: Therapeutic exercises including aerobic exercise, resistance, impact movement, and vibration, which can safely increase bone strength and muscle strength, improve equilibrium function, and prevent falls and fractures. For spinal deformity patients, appropriate orthotics can improve the security and promote exercise therapy. As with drug therapy, therapeutic exercises are also individualized. Exercise program should be selected under the insurance of good compliance and security. Exercises that involve high strain rates seem to be more effective than others. However, all these benefits are comparatively small, and should be maintained by continuous exercises.

84940353557	Comparison of different orthosis for improving gait in patients with spinal cord injury	BACKGROUND: Drop ring lock knee-ankle-foot orthosis has been widely used in patients with higher level spinal cord injury, with one primary limitation in ambulation being attributable to the absence of knee flexion in swing phase. As a result, an individual is forced to use compensatory upper body motions to advance the legs. At present, the research on the comparison between different knee-ankle-foot orthoses is rare. OBJECTIVE: To investigate and compare the clinical effect of E-MAG and drop ring lock knee-ankle-foot orthosis in the treatment of the patients with spinal cord injury. METHODS: With the approach of case crossover study, the application effect of drop ring lock knee-ankle-foot orthosis in combination with an E-MAG on a patient with a T<inf>10</inf> spinal cord injury was observed. With the measurement of three-dimensional gait data, a comparison was made between the scenarios of having the knees locked during the entire gait cycle to that of allowing the knees to flex freely during the swing phase, yet still be locked for stability during stance. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Qualitative observation and kinematic three-dimensional gait data demonstrated that this patient ambulated with a faster, more efficient gait pattern when using E-MAG. Despite having no voluntary control of knees, this orthotic option afforded the ability to walk safely and smoothly with both knees flexing during swing and knee lock in stance phase, and with less upper body compensation. Compared with drop ring lock knee-ankle-foot orthosis, E-MAG active orthosis contains stance phase control, so it has higher degree of acceptance and practicality.

Peoples all over the world have realized that we must do standard clinical trials to ensure that the researches are objective, scientific and high efficiency. The primary problem is that not any we must think of it's particularity and complexity when human being is research object, but also we must ensure the research is scientific. According to the requirement of clinical research design, we should abide by four principles in clinical trials. Those are random, control, blind and being in line with ethics. There are some problems in Chinese clinical trials, such as publishing bias, Chinese clinical trials especially in Chinese trade medicine and herbs not being accepted, lack of approved clinical trial unit (CTU) in China, problems in the designing, carrying out, management, monitoring and reporting of randomized control trials (RCTs) The methods and quality of clinical trials should be improved. Published Chinese medical literatures were hand-searched to set up clinical trials database. It is the foundation of systematic review and health technology assessment. The level of clinical trial in China should be improved. We should use RCTs or double-blind design. We advocate multi-center and large cooperation research. This article introduced the concept and characteristic of clinical trial (CT), history of Chinese clinical trial, phase of pharmacy clinical trial, GCP and problems and announcements of clinical trial. CT is a kind of researches about pharmacy or other interventions in human body to certain the effects and security of trial pharmacy or other interventions.

2442562290	Improve the qualities of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in China	The meta-analytic results of the high qualitative randomized controlled trails (RCT) and the results of the large sampling RCT that is acknowledged in the world are recognized to be the most authoratative evidences. Those evidences can provide more reliable and scientific foundation for clinical practice and health policy-making. Moreover, the clinical doctors can use these evidences to make the best choice during their practice. On the contrary, meta-analysis with poor quality may result in error conclusion. The meta-analysis is becoming more and more mature abroad. However, in our country there still are several serious defects of meta-analysis. To discuss how to improve the qualities of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials in China in order to provide more reliable and scientific evidences for EBM and pharmacology. According to procedures of the meta-analysis of RCT, we review the problems and their resolutions of meta-analyses methods that are employed within China, concluding: questioning (the purpose of the research), comprehensive collecting relative RCT, formulating strict standard which decides if the patients can be bring into or removed, correctly getting out the data, assessment of RCT, using correct statistic methods, analyzing sensitivity, making comprehensive and correct conclusion. The ideal meta-analysis of RCT must conclude all high qualitative RCT currently, no public bias, using correct model and statistic methods and comprehensive explanation of the conclusion. In a word, the more conditions that are satisfied in each step of the analysis, the higher quality results we get.

2442501359	Application of evidence-based medicine in rehabilitation clinic	The history of Evidence-based medicine(EBM) is short, but it has been developed rapidly. A Canadian scholar, David Sackett, published an EBM article formally in 1992 and gave the concept of EBM at first. The Cochrane center, named as famous deceased British epidemiologist and physician, that is Archie Cochrane who was the beginner of the EBM, was set up in Oxford University in 1992. The first EBM annual meeting was hold in Oxford in 1993 and Cochrane collaboration was set up at the same time. 13 branches of Cochrane center has been established in 13 countries now. We started to prepare the construction of China Cochrane center in the 1st affiliated hospital of West China University of Medicine Sciences (WCUMS) in 1995. The application of preparing the construction of China Cochrane center was sent to Health Ministry of P. R. C formally by he 1st affiliated hospital of West China University of Medicine Sciences in Feb 1997. China Cochrane center was accept and registered by international Cochrane Collaboration and became the first Asian Cochrane center. EBM and it's research methods provides a new way to solve the global problems such as rapidly increasing of medical cost and high cost without best medical service. EBM developed rapidly recently and was used to many clinical disciplines. They crossed each other and developed many frontier branches of science, such as evidence-based neuroscience, evidence-based obstetrics and gynecology and evidence-based pediatrics. Its association between EBM and rehabilitation is not so much. Author tried to introduce die application of EBM in physiatry to physiatricians. This article explained the importance of developing EBM in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and introduced the classification of evidences and steps of practicing EBM. Author thinks the clinical physicians should look for the best evidences to solve patients' practical problems by participating and taking advantage of Cochrane collaboration and reading and using EBM literatures. It shows good economic and social affect after EBM has been used in heat and pulmonary disease, nerve system disease and bone and joint disease. Nowadays, the original literatures of part of system reviews are not enough. Many system reviews not involves large, multiple center randomized control trials. There are not any helpful conclusions in some system reviews. Author summarized research outline of EBM about the diseases in rehabilitation section. It will help physiatrician practice EBM. It is useful to do some researches in physiatry too.

Data sources: Papers about extracorporeal shock wave from January 1990 to December 2004 were computer-searched in Medline, with the key words of "extracorporeal shock wave, fracture healing, nonunion, delayed osseous union", and the language was limited to English. Meanwhile, the same papers as above were also computer-searched in Wanfang database and China Journal full-text database, limiting the language to Chinese, with the key words of "extracorporeal shock wave, fracture healing, nonunion, delayed osseous union" in Chinese. Study selection: The related papers were selected by the primary trial, and the selection was performed and the literatures in the experimental group and control group. Excluded papers were obviously non-randomly control experiment, and the left papers were searched in the full-text and further judging as randomly controlled trial. Inclusion criteria: 1 Randomly controlled trial with single-blind, double-blind or non-blind methods. 2 Studies include concurrent control group. Exclusion criteria: Repeated studies Data extraction: Totally 45 randomly controlled papers on nonunion and delayed union of bone fracture with extracorporeal shock wave were found, and 39 experiments were quoted. Six articles were excluded due to repeated studies. Thirty-nine trials involved animal experimentations, clinical trials, mechanism and unsolved problems of extracorporeal shock wave therapy of nonunion or delayed osseous union. Each trial was assessed. Data synthesis: It was found in many clinical studies that extracorporeal shock wave has effect on the nonunion of bone fracture in treatment of bone fracture of human long bone. Curative rate was 41%-85% with the advantages of noninvasiveness, less complications and relative safety. Mechanism of extracorporeal shock wave in treatment of osseous nonunion was caused by integrative factors, which active the biological state of osseous nonunion. Coordination effect of many factors promotes the healing of osseous nonunion, such as fresh bone fracture-like healing process appeared, extracorporeal shock wave itself has stimulating effect on tissue cell, and cytokine and growth factor could induce into osteoblast. At present, it had great difference of the power of energy, treatment times, total doses of extracorporeal shock wave as well as whether to need anesthesia and sedative. Conclusion: Extracorporeal shock wave therapy is a safe, effective and noninvasive method with less complications in the treatment of nonunion or delayed osseous union of bone fracture. But it is still to lack reliablely random prospective studies to prove the exact curative effect.

Methods: The animal model with chronic renal failure was established by using the method of 5/6 nephrectomy. The animals were randomly divided into four groups: SXFYC treatment group, losartan treatment group, control group and pseudo-operation group (normal group). Since the next day after operations, the rats in the SXFYC treatment group and the losartan treatment group had been intragastrically administrated with SXFYC 300 mg/kg · d and losartan 150 mg/kg · d respectively. The rats in the normal group and control group were fed with sodium chloride twice a day. Four, eight and twelve weeks later, histological and biochemical tests were undertaken to examine changes of the remnant kidney such as α-SMA, collagen I, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and proteinuria. The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Both SXFYC and losartan ameliorated the histological change of remnant kidney, decreased the level of CTGF mRNA, serum creatinine and proteinuria (P<0.01). There were no significant differences between the SXFYC and losartan treatment groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: "Shenxian Fuyuan Capsule" can improve the renal function of the 5/6 nephrectomized rats. It performs as well as losartan. "Shenxian Fuyuan Capsule" might have played an important role in preventing CTGF-mediated renal fibrosis in the 5/6 nephrectomized rats.

33747309751	Clinical and molecular biological mechanism of Chinese medicine for prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure	Aim: To analyze the physiological mechanism of Chinese medicine for treatment of chronic renal failure, and explore the important pathological factors on prevention and treatment of chronic renal failure with Chinese medicine, so as to summarize the clinical and scientific research advancement of Shenxian Fuyuan capsule on treatment of chronic renal failure. Methods: A computer-based online search of Medline was undertaken for articles about treatment of chronic renal failure with Chinese herb published in English between January 1993 and June 2006 with the key words of "chronic renal failure, traditional Chinese medicine". Meanwhile, we searched the Chinese Journal Full-text Database for related articles published in Chinese between January 1994 and June 2006 with the same key words in Chinese. Results: Deficiency of qi, blood, yin and yang is the Chinese medical pathogenesis of chronic renal failure, and mainly manifested by damp-heat, noxious water disease, accumulation of phlegm and blood stasis. Its development of deficiency of genuine qi is from deficiency of spleen-qi and kidney-qi (deficiency of both qi and yin) to deficiency of spleen-yang and kidney-yang and deficiency of both yin and yang. In treatment, it should be paid more attention to the interaction of tonifying spleen and kidney, eliminating pathogenic factor and lowering turbid urine, nourishing blood and activating blood and promoting blood circulation by removing blood stasis, and the application of treated principle of resolving hard mass and recovery by anti-fibrosis. The summary of clinical data suggests that Shenxian Fuyuan capsule can delay renal failure, improve the quality of life of patients and has no obvious side reaction. Conclusion: The curative effect of Shenxian Fuyuan capsule on chronic renal failure may be related to decrease of activation and formation of myofibroblast, down-regulation of the expression of connective tissue growth factor in injured kidney tissue, inhibition of accumulation of extracellular matrix and transdifferentiation of cells.

Method: Fifty female SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: 1 SHAM control (no PEMFs treatment), 2 OVX control(no PEMFs treatment), 3 OVX I (PEMFs treatment at 8Hz frequency with 3.8mT intensity, 20min daily for 30 days), 4 OVX II(PEMFs treatment at 8Hz frequency with 3.8mT intensity, 40min daily for 30 days), and 5 OVX III (PEMFs treatment at 8Hz frequency with 3.8mT intensity, 60min daily for 30 days). All rats were subjected to bilateral ovarieetomy except those in the SHAM control group. Serum estradiol (E2) and bone calcium content of femur were assessed on the 30th days after PEMFs treatment. Result: The E2 values of the SHAM control group were significantly higher than that of the other 4 groups (P<0.05 or P<0.01), but the difference in E2 values was not significant among the other 4 groups (P>0.05). The bone calcium contents of the OVX control group were significantly lower than that of the other 4 groups (P<0.01), but the difference of calcium contents was not significant among the other 4 groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Under certain intensity (3.8mT) and frequency (8Hz), PEMFs of the three different treatment time can't significantly improve serum estradiol level in ovariectomized rats. PEMFs of the three different treatment time can significantly maintain bone calcium content of femur approximately to the normal level in ovariectomized rats, but among the three groups, the difference is not significant. It shows that PEMFs have the same effect of maintaining bone calcium content with no correlation of increasing the treatment time within the range of 20-60min in ovariectomized rats.

34547407247	Effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields of different frequencies on serum estradiol and bone calcium content of femur in ovariectomized rats	Objective: To observe the effect of PEMFs of different frequencies on serum estradiol and bone calcium content of femur in ovariectomized rats, in order to find out the frequency of the best therapeutic efficacy.Method: Fifty female SD rats were randomly divided into five groups:1SHAM control (no PEMFs treatment);2OVX control (no PEMFs treatment); 3OVX 1, OVX II and OVX III groups(PEMFs treatment 3.8mT, 40min daily, 30 days, but with different frequency at 2Hz, 8Hz, 16Hz respectively). All rats were subjected to bilateral overiectomy except those in the SHAM control group. Serum estradiol(E2) and bone calcium content of femur was assessed on the 30th day after PEMFs treatment.Result:The E2 values of the SHAM control group were significantly higher than that of other 4 groups(P<0.05 or P<0.01), but the difference in E2 values was not significant among the other 4 groups(P> 0.05). The bone calcium contents of the OVX control group were significantly lower than that of other 4 groups(P< 0.05 or P<0.01), but the difference of calcium contents was not significant among other 4 groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: The mechanism of PEMFs on osteoporotic therapy isn't increment of serum estradiol. But PEMFs of three different frequencies can maintain the bone calcium content in ovariectomized rats, maintain bone calcium content of femur approximately to the nomal level in ovariectomized rats, the difference among three groups is not significant. It shows that 2-16Hz 3.8mT PEMFs have the same effect of maintaining bone calcium content in ovariectomized rats.

38349176398	Effect of pain-free exercises on female osteoporosis patients with spinal compressive fracture	Aim: To identify the clinical effect of pain-free exercises on the female osteoporosis patients with spinal compressive fracture. Methods: 1 Subjects: During August 2005 to March 2007, thirty female osteoporosis patients with spinal fracture, aged (66.43±7.20) years, were recruited from Out-patient Clinic or Department of Rehabilitation in West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Using the random digital table of SPSS software, all the patients were allocated to experimental group and control group, and each group included 15 patients. 2 Treatment: The patients of control group received the conventional therapy: calcium, vitamin D, calcitonin and low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic field therapy, and the patients of experimental group received not only the same therapy as the control group, but also the pain-free exercises for 10-30 minutes once, two times a day for 4 weeks. All the patients were evaluated before the therapy and at the end of the first and the fourth weeks after the therapy. 3 Assessment: The evaluation items included visual analogue scale (VAS): The patients were demanded to mark the scale of pain on a 10-cm staff guage, 0 as no pain and 10 as the most pain; timed up from bed (TUFB): The time of patients in supine position sitting up independently was measured; timed up and go (TUG): The time of patients standing up from chairs independently, walking for 3 m and returning was measured. Results: All the 30 patients entered the analysis of result. VAS scores, TUFB and TUG of two groups at the end of the first and the fourth weeks decreased compared with the initial level (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05). At the end of the first and the fourth weeks, the amount that the TUG decreased in the experimental group was more than that in the control group (P=0.002, P=0.000), and there was no significant difference in the decreased amounts of VAS scores and TUFB between experimental group and control group (P > 0.05). At the end of the fourth week, the levels of TUFB and TUG in the experimental group were less than those in the control group (P=0.000, P=0.014). Conclusion: The exercises within a pain-free range can effectively reduce the pain and improve the impaired motor function c aused by osteoporostic spinal compressive fracture in female patients.

84908169836	Osteogenic differentiation of amniotic epithelial cells: Synergism of pulsed electromagnetic field and biochemical stimuli	Background: Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) is a non-invasive physical therapy used in the treatment of fracture nonunion or delayed healing. PEMF can facilitate the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. Amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) have been proposed as a potential source of stem cells for cell therapy. However, whether PEMF could modulate the osteogenic differentiation of AECs is unknown. In the present study, the effects of PEMF on the osteogenic differentiation of AECs were investigated. Methods: AECs were isolated from amniotic membrane of human placenta by trypsin digestion and were induced by PEMF and/or osteo-induction medium. After 21 days we used real time RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry to study the expression of osteoblast markers. The signal transduction of osteogenesis was further investigated. Results: The PEMF stimulation, or osteo-induction medium alone could induce osteogenic differentiation of AECs, as shown by expression of osteoblast specific genes and proteins including alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. Furthermore, a combination of PEMF and osteo-induction medium had synergy effects on osteogenic differentiation. In our study, the gene expression of BMP-2, Runx2, β- catenin, Nrf2, Keap1 and integrin β1 were up-regulated in the osteogenic differentiation of AECs induced by PEMF and/or osteo-induction medium. Conclusions: Combined application of PEMF and osteo-induction medium is synergistic for the osteogenic differentiation of AECs. It might be a novel approach in the bone regenerative medicine.

61849157438	From exercise to sport: Tendency of walking training in physical therapy	The paradigm for physical therapist management of nervous system disorder needs to shift from traditional or "packaged" approaches to a more focused and proactive approach of promoting activity through more intense active training protocols, lifestyle modifications, and mobility-enhancing devices. Increased motor activity has been shown to lead to better physical and mental health, in addition, to augment other aspects of functioning, such as cognitive performance, and more recently has been shown to promote neural and functional recovery in people with damaged nervous systems. Although the benefits of fairly intense physical exercise programs such as strength training are becoming increasingly well recognized, few studies on the positive effects of generalized activity programs have been conducted in individuals with nervous system disorder. But in physical therapy, more research is needed and it is currently under way to design and test the more efficacies of activity-based strategies in nervous system disorder.

65549133864	Central swallowing in normal adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging	Background: While brain-imaging studies in healthy adults have indicated that multiple cortical regions are involved in swallowing, these functional imaging techniques have not been extensively applied to the complete understand neurophysiology of swallowing in China. A full understanding of normal swallowing neurophysiology is important for improving functional outcomes for dysphagia due to neurologic disorders or damage with increasing age. Thus the interpretations of the functional contributions of various brain areas in swallowing should be scientifically researched. Objective: To identify the activation and characteristic of swallowing center in healthy adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Design, Time and Setting: An uncontrolled neuroimaging study was performed at the Outpatient Clinic, Department of Radiology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University between March and November 2008. Participants: Ten healthy right-handed volunteers, aged over 20 years with a mean age of (34.2 ± 8.1) years, a range of 25-45 years and including five males and five females participated. A medical history was obtained from all potential subjects and all subjects were free of systemic diseases and neurological disorders. Methods: The healthy volunteers were examined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging of blood oxygenation level-dependent while laryngeal swallow-related movements were recorded. Subjects were scanned during voluntary saliva swallowing and water bolus swallowing activation tasks. Data was processed using the General Linear Model. A voxel by voxel group comparison was performed using random effect analysis. Any cluster with a corrected P < 0.05 for spatial extent was considered significant. Main Outcome Measures: The cerebral cortical activation maps of voluntary swallowing of saliva and swallowing of water bolus in healthy adults were observed. Results: A multifocal cortical representation of swallowing was in the precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, insula, anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, basal ganglia and cerebellum, in a bilateral and asymmetrical manner, predominantly on the left hemisphere in the volunteers (P< 0.05). Conclusion: Activation of the cortex during normal swallowing tasks may be functionally linked to basal nuclei, thalamus, and cerebellum, greatly appearing in the left hemisphere.

Forty-eight female rats were exposed to PEMFs (PEMFs group), administrated E2 and placebo PEMFs (E group), or were treated with placebo PEMFs (OVX and Sham groups). The treatment duration was 30 days after which serum E2 levels, chondrocyte morphology, chondrocyte apoptosis and matrix metalloproteinases-13 expression in knee joint was analyzed. We observed differential chondrocyte formation in each group, and serum E2 content in the PEMFs and E group were significantly higher than the OVX group. The apoptosis index of chondrocytes and the positive index of MMP13 expression in the PEMFs group and E group were significantly lower than the OVX group. PEMFs has a systemic effect on estrogen metabolism in ovariectomized rats, then inhibit chondrocyte apoptosis and downregulate MMP13 expression of knee joint cartilage. It may be the mechanisms by which PEMFs therapy works for on postmenopausal osteoarthritis. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

70450183084	Structural and functional changes mapped in the brains of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with/without dysphagia: A pilot study	The purpose of this study was to explore cerebral structural and functional changes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with or without dysphagia compared with healthy adults. In total, five ALS patients with dysphagia, five ALS patients without dysphagia and 10 healthy controls were evaluated using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DTI) and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while laryngeal swallow-related movements were recorded. The fMRI data were analysed using the general linear model to gain the differential statistical map (two-sample t-test) for each group. Maps of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were calculated within the masks that corresponded to the different statistical functional maps of intergroup comparisons. During the voluntary saliva swallowing, prominent activation of foci corresponded to the primary sensorimotor (SM) cortex in both ALS and controls, while decreased activation of the SM cortex was observed in ALS patients with dysphagia. DTI analysis revealed that FA was significantly reduced and MD was typically increased in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, thalamus, and anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as in the insula of ALS patients compared with controls. However, in ALS patients with dysphagia, FA and MD were more sensitive to these changes than ALS patients without dysphagia. This study highlights the potential of DTI and fMRI for monitoring structural degeneration and functional changes in patients with ALS. This study is the first to demonstrate that cerebral activation map changes correspond to distribution patterns of diffusion abnormalities. Combined non-invasive neuroimaging techniques may be useful tools to assess prognosis and study rehabilitation strategies for dysphagic ALS patients, especially for patients who are MRI-negative by conventional methods. © 2009 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved.

72449174865	Functional magnetic resonance imaging study on dysphagia after unilateral hemispheric stroke: A preliminary study	Background: Swallowing dysfunction is common and disabling after acute stroke; however, the mechanism of dysphagia or recovery of swallowing from dysphagia remains uncertain. The purpose of this study was to explore cerebral activation of swallowing in dysphagia using functional MRI (fMRI) to compare the functional anatomy of swallowing in unilateral hemispheric stroke patients and healthy adults. Methods: In total, five left hemispheric stroke patients with dysphagia, five right hemispheric stroke patients with dysphagia and 10 healthy controls were examined with event related fMRI while laryngeal swallow related movements were recorded. Data were processed using the general linear model. Results: A multifocal cerebral representation of swallowing was identified predominantly in the left hemisphere, in a bilateral and asymmetrical manner. Cerebral activation during swallowing tasks was localised to the precentral, postcentral and anterior cingulate gyri, insula and thalamus in all groups. Activation of volitional swallowing in dysphagic unilateral hemispheric stroke patients might require reorganisation of the dominant hemispheric motor cortex, or a compensatory shift in activation to unaffected areas of the hemisphere. Conclusions: The results indicate that unilateral stroke of either cerebral hemisphere can produce dysphagia. Effective recovery is associated with cerebral activation related to cortical swallowing representation in the compensating or recruited areas of the intact hemisphere. Functional MRI is a useful method for exploring the spatial localisation of changes in neuronal activity during tasks that may be related to recovery. Therefore, the subsequent information gleaned from changes in neural plasticity could be useful for assessing the prognosis of dysphagic stroke.

75149117712	Effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields on the mRNA expression of RANK and CAII in ovariectomized rat osteoclast-like cell	This study was designed to determine the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on the mRNA expression of the receptor activator of NF-κ-B (RANK) and carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) in ovariectomized rat osteoclast-like cells. Marrow cells were harvested from femora and tibiae of rats, from which the ovaries had been totally excised, and cultured in 6-well chamber slides. After 1 day of incubation, the marrow cells were exposed to PEMF for 3 days with 3.8 mT, 8 Hz, and 40 min per day. Osteoclast-like cells were confirmed by both tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain and bone resorption assay. The expression of RANK and CA II mRNA was determined with real-time fluorescent-nested quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Compared with the sham group, the level of serum estradiol in the ovariectomized group was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The numbers of multinucleated, TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells and resorption pits formed were observed. In invitro study, the expression of RANK and CA II were measured in sham, ovariectomized without PEMF, and ovariectomized with PEMF treatment. Compared with the ovariectomized (PEMF) experimental group and sham group, CA II mRNA expression was significantly increased in the ovariectomized control group (p < 0.05, 0.01, respectively). Compared with the sham group, RANK mRNA expression was significantly increased in the ovariectomized control group (p < 0.05). These data suggest that PEMF could regulate the expression of RANK and CA II mRNA in the marrow culture system.

77955062574	Effect of spinal stabilization training on the vertebral osteoporotic compression fracture: An individualized program	BACKGROUND: Surgery is a main method to reconstruct the stability of spine after compression fracture. But the reconstruction of spinal stability for patients undergoing conventional therapy remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To explore whether spinal stability training is effective on improving pain and motor function of patients with vertebral osteoporotic fractures. METHODS: Patients with vertebral osteoporotic fractures were divided into two groups. The study group was treated with conventional treatments and individualized spinal stabilization training, while the control group received conventional treatments alone. All the subjects were evaluated before and after treatment by numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), 3-meter timed up and go (TUG) and Oswestry functional limitation index (OFLI). The results were compared between the two groups. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 27 patients were included, including 16 patients in the study group and 11 in the control group. After 4-week treatment, TUG and OFLI in the study group decreased significantly compared with the control group (P < 0.05). But there was no statistical significance between the two groups in the level of NPRS and the amount of changes (P > 0.05). Symptoms and function of both groups were improved after treatments. Individualized spinal stability training is effective to restore the motor function and may be helpful for reducing pain for patients with vertebral osteoporotic fractures combined with conventional treatments.

Rehabilitation, like surgery, also has a high risk. The main source of risk comes from nonstandard rehabilitation operation on diseases without clear diagnosis. This article presents a case study of a patient with cervical spine disease with intracranial arterial aneurysm diagnosis and treatment, to explore the potential of rehabilitation medicine and examine the risk of physicianpatient conflicts. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

77955532239	The correlation of osteoporosis to clinical features: A study of 4382 Female Cases of a Hospital Cohort with musculoskeletal symptoms in Southwest China	Background. By analyzing the clinical features and risk factors in female patients with musculoskeletal symptoms of Southwest China, this report presents the initial analysis of characteristics in this region and compared with international evaluative criteria. Methods. Diagnosis of osteoporosis (OP) was made in female hospital patients age 18 years admitted from January 1998 to December 2008 according to WHO definition. Case data were analyzed by symptoms, age, disease course and risk factors to reveal correlation with diagnosis of OP. Logistic regression was used to identify the risks of osteoporosis. Results. A total of 4382 patients were included in the analysis of the baseline characteristics, among which 1455 in the OP group and 2927 in the non-OP group. The morbidity of OP is significantly increased in females' 50 years. Both groups had symptoms related to pain and numbness; no significant difference was found in reported upper and lower back pain, or leg pain between two groups (p > 0.05). Neck, shoulder and arm pain, leg and arm numbness were more common in the non-osteoporosis group (p < 0.05, OR < 1, and upper limit of 95% CI of OR < 1). Hypertension, diabetes, hyperostosis were major risk factors for the patients with OP. The most common lifestyle-related risk factors for osteoporosis were smoking, body mass index, lack of physical activity and menopause. Conclusions. The present study offers the first reference data of the relationship between epidemiologic distribution of osteoporosis and associated factors in adults Chinese women. These findings provide a theoretical basis for its prevention and treatment in developing country. © 2010 Li et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

78649286517	Electrical stimulation upregulates angiopoietin-1/Tie-2 mRNA expression in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia	Angiopoietin-1/tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and epidermal growth factor homology domains 2 (Tie-2) is a newly discovered signaling pathway of angiogenesis. Angiogenesis benefits recovery of neurological functions such as swallowing. In the present study, a rat model of dysphagia following stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion to investigate the influence of low frequency electrical stimulus with bidirectional square waves and triangular waves on angiopoietin-1/Tie-2 mRNA expression. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that low frequency electrical stimulus significantly improved the neurological scores of the model rats, and increased angiopoietin-1/Tie-2 mRNA expression. This demonstrates that low frequency electrical stimulation can ameliorate neurological function in rats with focal brain ischemia, potentially through regulation of angiopoietin-1/Tie-2 expression in the angiogenesis pathway.

79952477340	Effects of cervical low-frequency electrical stimulation with various waveforms and densities on body mass, liver and kidney function, and death rate in ischemic stroke rats	Low-frequency electrical stimulation has resulted in favorable effects in the treatment of post-stroke dysphagia. However, the safety of cervical low-frequency electrical stimulation remains unclear because of numerous nerves and blood vessels in the neck. In the present study, rats with ischemic stroke underwent low-frequency electrical stimulation, and systemic and local effects of electrical stimulation at different densities and waveforms were investigated. Electrical stimulation resulted in no significant effects on body mass, liver or kidney function, or mortality rate. In addition, no significant adverse reaction was observed, despite overly high intensity of low-frequency electrical stimulation, which induced laryngismus, results from the present study suggested that it is safe to stimulate the neck with a low-frequency electricity under certain intensities.

79955763095	The motor function and activities of daily living capacity of seismic wounded patients in intensive care unit ward in 5.12 wenchuan earthquake of china	Objective: To describe the motor function and activities of daily living (ADL) functional status of the seismic wounded patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) ward, and to provide insight to the planning on their clinical rehabilitation program. Method: A prospective study. Trained assessor applied different common testing methods to measure the motor functions of seismic wounded patients treated in ICU: (1) Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) method to evaluate muscle strength; (2) joint angle ruler to assess joint range of motion (ROM); (3) passive joint activities to assess the muscle tension; (4) Modified Ashworth Score (MAS) to assess spasm; (5) balanced response to assess sitting balance and standing balance; (6) international generic Barthel Index Scale to evaluate ADL. Complications as related to rehabilitation were also recorded. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the epidemiology, pattern of motor function loss and type of injuries. Results: The most common types of injuries in our sample of seismic wounded treated in ICU were: fracture (70%), nervous system injuries (20%), squeezing syndrome (5%) and pulmonary contusion (5%). The fracture proportion was higher in female than male (about 2:1). Amputation and paralysis occurred more in male than female (about 7:1 and 3:1 respectively). Lung infection as a complication in ICU stay was more common in female than male (4:1). We reported that most of the seismic wounded patient had early loss of motor function during the stay in ICU. Conclusion: Limited ROM, declined muscle strength, abnormal muscle tension, balance dysfunction, alteration of ADL capacity and lung infection are the main dysfunctions occurring among the seismic wounded in ICU ward. Loss of motor function can occur early and therefore active physiotherapy should start even during the stay in ICU.

79957568488	Motor function and activities of daily living capacity of patients with fractures sustained during the Wenchuan earthquake	Background On the afternoon of May 12, 2008, a 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit Sichuan Province, a mountainous region in Western China, killing about 70 000 people and leaving over 18 000 missing. What about the survivors motor functions and activities of daily living (ADL) capacity, especially for fractures? We need the data to guide the rehabilitation for the seismic wounded and it's important to collect the data for the future. We study the survivors to understand the motor functions and ADL capacity of patients with fractures sustained in the Wenchuan earthquake, to provide a basis for rehabilitation and treatment. Methods We used the Manual Muscle Testing method to evaluate muscle strength, the joint angle scale to measure joint range of motion (ROM), and the Barthel index to evaluate the activities of daily living status. SPSS 13.0 software was used to analyze the data and the results were tested using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results The number of seismic wounded amounted to 487; 81.1% of patients had fractures. Most of the injured had fractures in multiple regions (53.9% of all fracture patients), followed by fractures of the upper limb (34.0% of patients); cranial fractures were rare (2.3%). Totally 82.0% had restricted range of motion, 23.5% had decreased muscle force, and 72.2% of the patients had restricted activities of daily living capacities. With time the activities of daily living capacity of female increased (P <0.05), compared with the male fracture patients who did not show any relative improvement (P >0.05). The difference between the patients' ages and ADL capacities did not reach statistical significance (P >0.05), nor was there a significant difference between their ages and the numbers of days in hospital (P >0.05). Conclusions Fractures were the main issue in the seismic wounded, many of them had reductions in the ROM, muscle force and ADL capacities. The physicians involved in rehabilitation should pay greater attention to muscle force exercises, joint mobilization, and occupational therapy during the early phases post disaster.

80053151096	A nonlinear optimal human postural regulator	A postural control model for a quietly standing human is proposed. The musculoskeletal dynamics of the human is modeled as a triple inverted pendulum in the sagittal plan, including ankle, knee and hip joints. A nonlinear optimal control problem is defined to study the postural sway. It has a performance measure with quadratic terms in the controls and a quartic term in either the center of pressure (COP) or the horizontal projection of the center of mass (COM). This objective function provides a trade-off between the allowed deviations from the nominal value and the neuromuscular energy required to correct for these deviations. By using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique, the discrete-time approximation to each of these problems is converted into a nonlinear programming problem and then solved. The solution gives a control scheme that demonstrates qualitative agreement to the main features of the joint kinematics and coordination observed experimentally. © 2011 AACC American Automatic Control Council.

81755168952	Changes in plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide and serum neuron specific enolase in rats with acute cerebral ischemia after low-frequency electrical stimulation with different waveforms and intensities	Following acute cerebral ischemia in rats, plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide decreased and the level of serum neuron specific enolase and the volume of the infarction increased. Square-wave and triangular-wave electrical stimulation with low or high intensities could increase the plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide, decrease the serum neuron specific enolase and reduce the infarction volume in the brain in rats with cerebral ischemia. There was no significant difference between different wave forms and intensities. The experimental findings indicate that low-frequency electrical stimulation with varying waveforms and intensities can treat acute cerebral ischemia in rats.

82955236241	Effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields on cartilage apoptosis signalling pathways in ovariectomised rats	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exposure to pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) on modulation of the cartilage apoptosis signalling pathway in ovariectomised rats by monitoring the expression of mRNA of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and Bax. Methods: Forty-eight female Sprague-Dawley rats (250 ± 50 g) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: ovariectomy with PEMF treatment (PEMF group), ovariectomy with oestradiol (E2) treatment (oestrogen group), ovariectomy control (OVX group) and sham group. The ovariectomy model was prepared by surgical resection of the ovaries. After a three-month intermission, animals in the PEMF and oestrogen groups received treatment for 30 days; then serum 17β-oestradiol levels, chondrocyte morphology, and XIAP and Bax mRNA expression in knee joint cartilage were analysed. Results: The results showed different chondrocyte formation in each group. Serum E2 content in the PEMF and oestrogen groups was significantly higher than in the OVX group (p < 0.05). The expression of XIAP mRNA in the PEMF and oestrogen groups was significantly up-regulated compared to the OVX group, while that of Bax mRNA was significantly down-regulated (p < 0.05). The correlation between E2 level and expression of Bax mRNA was positive (0.506) and statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: These data demonstrate that PEMF can up-regulate XIAP mRNA expression and down-regulate Bax mRNA expression in ovariectomised rats. Changes in XIAP and Bax mRNA expression may be the mechanism by which PEMF therapy affects postmenopausal osteoarthritis. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

84855975783	Comparing different physical factors on serum TNF-α levels, chondrocyte apoptosis, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression in osteoarthritis of the knee in rabbits	Objective: To study the therapeutic effects that different physical factors may have on rabbits with osteoarthritis of the knee. Methods: A total of 64 rabbits were randomised and organised into eight groups, eight of which were each assigned a different physical factor, in which the rabbits received one type of physical therapy: millimetre waves for 20. min, pulsed electromagnetic fields, millimetre waves for 40. min, ultrasound, low-level laser therapy or ultrashort wave diathermy. The two remaining groups, the normal group and the model group, served as controls. The efficacy of the different treatments were determined by observing the configuration and structure of the cartilaginous tissue by haematoxylin and Eosin staining, measuring the serum tumour necrosis factor-α levels by enzyme immunoassay, evaluating the expression levels of caspases-3 and -8 by immunohistochemistry, and calculating the ratio of chondrocytes apoptosis by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling. The values obtained for each assessment of the eight groups were analysed by a One-way ANOVA. Results: By applying upmentioned physical treatments, the organisational configuration and structure of cartilage cells from the knees of rabbits with osteoarthritis increased. These treatments also decreased serum tumour necrosis factor-α levels, reduced the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8 and reduced chondrocyte apoptosis, resulting in an overall delay in osteoarthritis development. Conclusion: The application of pulsed electromagnetic fields, millimetre waves for 40. min, ultrasound, or low-level laser therapy had significant effects in improving osteoarthritis; in particular, treatment with pulsed electromagnetic fields or ultrasound yielded the greatest therapeutic effect. © 2011 Société française de rhumatologie.

84859725128	Electroacupuncture prevents ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats: A randomised controlled trial	Background Electroacupuncture (EA) treatment has been shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in ovariectomised (OVX) rats; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Objective To systematically evaluate the effects of EA on OVX rats and the Wnt/â-catenin signalling pathway. Methods Three-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three different groups (n=10 each): sham operated control (sham operated), ovariectomy (OVX) and ovariectomy with EA treatment (OVX+EA). Rats in the OVX+EA group received 12-week EA treatments. Results Serum bone-specifi c alkaline phosphatase level (p<0.01), BMD of the proximal femoral metaphysis and the fi fth lumbar (L5) vertebral body (both, p<0.05) and maximum load and energy to failure of L5 vertebral body (both p<0.01) were signifi cantly higher in the OVX+EA group than in the OVX group. Trabecular area, trabecular width and trabecular number were signifi cantly higher in the OVX+EA group by 66.9%, 29.2% and 30.3%, respectively, than in the OVX group (all, p<0.01). Trabecular separation was 31.9% lower in the OVX+EA group than in the OVX group (p<0.01). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerised chain reaction indicated that the expressions of mRNAs for low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and â-catenin were signifi cantly increased in the OVX+EA group, as compared with the OVX group (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). Conclusion This study demonstrates that EA can prevent OVX-induced bone loss and deterioration of bone architecture and strength by stimulating the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. These fi ndings suggest that EA may bet a promising adjunct method for inhibiting OVX-induced osteoporosis in clinical settings.

84863332190	The effect of low-level laser to apoptosis of chondrocyte and caspases expression, including caspase-8 and caspase-3 in rabbit surgery-induced model of knee osteoarthritis	The purpose of this study was to observe the effect of 810-nm low-level laser to apoptosis of chondrocyte and related proteins, including caspase-3 and caspase-8, in rabbit surgery-induced model of knee osteoarthritis. A total of 24 New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned into 3 groups: test group, model group, and normal group. The rabbits in test group and model group received anterior cruciate ligament transection in the right knee. Six weeks after transection, the rabbits in test group were given 10-session 810-nm laser illumination. Eight weeks after transection, all animal were killed. Modified Mankin Score was made for histological assessment. The caspases expressions and chondrocytes apoptosis were tested using the immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assessment, respectively. The modified Mankin Score of test group was significantly lower than model group (P\0.01) and higher than normal group (P<0.01). The caspase-8 expression of test group was lower than model group and higher than normal group, but no significant difference was found (P>0.05). This study revealed that the 810-nm low-level laser can improve cartilage structure, prevent articular cartilage degradation and significantly decrease the expression of caspase-3 in this surgery-induced OA model.

84864104885	Effects of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields on Bone Mass and Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in Ovariectomized Rats	Background and Aims: The therapeutic effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on osteoporosis have been documented. However, the precise mechanisms by which PEMFs elicit these favorable biological responses are still not fully understood. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effects of PEMFs on bone mass and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in ovariectomized rats. Methods: Thirty 3-month-old female Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of three groups: sham-operated control (sham), ovariectomy (OVX), and ovariectomy with PEMFs treatment (PEMFs). One week following ovariectomy surgery, rats in the PEMFs group were exposed to PEMFs for 40 min/day, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks. Results: After 12-week interventions, serum 17β-estradiol and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels increased in the PEMFs group. Bone mineral density of the femur and the fifth lumbar vertebral body also increased in the PEMFs group. Histomorphometrical studies showed that PEMFs improved trabecular area, trabecular width, and trabecular number by 77.50%, 17.38% and 51.06%, respectively, and reduced trabecular separation by 44.28% compared with the OVX group. Biomechanical studies showed that PEMFs increased maximum load and energy to failure in the fifth lumbar vertebral body. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that PEMFs increased the mRNA expressions of Wnt3a, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5(LRP5), β-catenin, c-myc and runt-related gene 2 (Runx2), and reduced dickkopf1 (DKK1) in ovariectomized rats. However, mRNA expression of Axin2 was not affected by PEMFs. Conclusions: PEMFs can prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss and deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength, at least partly, through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. © 2012 IMSS.

84864708745	Establishment of a rabbit model of knee joint osteoarthritis combined with osteoporosis	BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have shown that there are a large proportion of patients suffering from osteoarthritis (OA) combined with osteoporosis (OP). Now the relationship between OA and OP is disputed. So an animal model of OA combined with OP is beneficial to prevention and treatment of OA combined with OP and also facilitates to understand the relationship between OA and OP. OBJECTIVE: To establish an animal model of OA combined with OP. METHODS: Fourteen white New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into a normal control group (NC group) and an ovariectomy group (OVX group). The OVX group rabbits underwent bilateral ovariectomy. The NC group rabbits received no treatments. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: At 10 weeks after OVX, the OVX group rabbits showed obvious articular cartilage degeneration and serum estrogen and femoral bone mineral density were significantly decreased, while articular cartilage Mankin scores were significantly increased compared with the NC group (P < 0.01). Articular cartilage Mankin scores were negatively correlated with serum estrogen, while bone mineral density was positively correlated with serum estrogen. These results showed that a rabbit model of OA combined with OP of the knee joint can be successfully established by OVX.

84866388170	The Effect of diVerent treatment time of millimeter wave on chondrocyte apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-8, and MMP-13 expression in rabbit surgically induced model of knee osteoarthritis	The aim of this study is to observe the Effect of diVerent treatment time of millimeter wave (MMW) on chondrocyte apoptosis, caspase-3, caspase-8, and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) in rabbit knee osteoarthritis induced by anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT). Thirty-two New Zealand White rabbits were randomly assigned into 4 groups: millimeter wave treatment for 20-min group (MWT20); millimeter wave treatment for 40-min group (MWT40); model control group (MC) and normal control group (NC). All groups received anterior cruciate ligament transection in the right knee except NC group. Six weeks after transection, the MWT20 group and MWT40 group were given millimeter wave (MMW) at 37.5 GHz frequency, 8 mm wavelength, and 10 mW/cm2 power for 20 and 40 min, respectively, for 10 days. Eight weeks after transection, all animals were killed. ModiWed Mankin Score was assessed for histological assessment. Chondrocytes apoptosis was tested by the TUNEL assessment, and the expressions of related proteins were tested by the immunohistochemistry observation and Western blot. The modiWed Mankin Score, the chondrocyte apoptosis, and the expression of caspase-3 and MMP-13 in MWT40 group were signiWcantly lower than those in MC group. Only a decreasing trend of modiWed Mankin Score and caspase-3 and MMP-13 expression was found in MWT20 group. The caspase-8 expression of the treatment groups was lower than model control group and higher than normal control group, but no signiWcant diVerence was found. This study revealed MWT40 had a better therapeutic beneWt to osteoarthritis cartilage structure, decreased the apoptosis of chondrocyte, and caspase-3 and MMP-13 expression compared to MWT20. But only a decreasing trend of caspase-8 expression was found. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

84866854117	Study of the association between female obesity and osteoporosis	Background and objectives: Although several studies have considered obesity as a confounder for female osteoporosis, obesity's role as risk factor or a protective factor is not clear. No conclusion has been made about the correlation between obesity and osteoporosis. In this study, we examined the association between obesity and osteoporosis in Chinese women. Material and methods: 4202 qualified women were enrolled between August 2003 and December 2005. Data on their age, height, weight, basic disease, frequency of exercise and smoking habits were obtained via a questionnaire. Body mass index (BMI) was assessed as a surrogate measurement of fat mass and to describe obesity status in this study. The women were divided into an osteoporosis group or non-osteoporosis group according to the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine (L1-L4), which was assessed by a peripheral dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scanner. A T test was used to determine if the difference between the two groups had statistical significance. The rank sum test was used for ordinal numeration data analysis, and the Chi-squared test was used for unordered categorical data. Multiple logistic regressions were used to analyse the association between BMI and osteoporosis. Results: The logistic regression revealed five independent factors associated with osteoporosis, age, hypertension, smoking, exercise, and BMI, and three risk factors for osteoporosis: age, smoking and BMI. Conclusion: In Southwest China, obesity increases the risk of female osteoporosis. This finding provides a theoretical basis for its prevention in developing countries.

84869769861	Coffee consumption and risk of fractures: A meta-analysis	Introduction: Recent studies have indicated higher risk of fractures among coffee drinkers. To quantitatively assess the association between coffee consumption and the risk of fractures, we conducted this meta-analysis. Material and methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for prospective studies reporting the risk of fractures with coffee consumption. Quality of included studies was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa scale. We conducted a meta-analysis and a cumulative meta-analysis of relative risk (RR) for an increment of one cup of coffee per day, and explored the potential dose-response relationship. Sensitivity analysis was performed where statistical heterogeneity existed. Results: We included 10 prospective studies covering 214,059 participants and 9,597 cases. There was overall 3.5% higher fracture risk for an increment of one cup of coffee per day (RR = 1.035, 95% CI: 1.019-1.052). Pooled RRs were 1.049 (95% CI: 1.022-1.077) for women and 0.910 (95% CI: 0.873-0.949) for men. Among women, RR was 1.055 (95% CI: 0.999-1.114) for younger participants, and 1.047 (95% CI: 1.016-1.080) for older ones. Cumulative meta-analysis indicated that risk estimates reached a stabilization level (RR = 1.035, 95% CI: 1.019-1.052), and it revealed a positive dose-response relationship between coffee consumption and risk of fractures either for men and women combined or women specifically. Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests an overall harm of coffee intake in increasing the risk of fractures, especially for women. But current data are insufficient to reach a convincing conclusion and further research needs to be conducted. Copyright © 2012 Termedia & Banach.

84868637543	Bladder management of patients with spinal cord injuries sustained in the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake	This study's aim is provide an overview of the patients who suffered spinal cord injury (SCI) after the magnitude 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake, including each patient's demographic and epidemiological characteristics, bladder management status, and quality of life (QOL). We also assessed the relationships between bladder management methods, symptomatic urinary tract infection (SUTI), and QOL. Two years after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, a cross-sectional face-to-face survey was conducted on 180 patients with SCI. A self-administered questionnaire and the WHOQOL-BREF assessment were used to assess injury-related information, bladder management methods, and SUTI. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test and analysis of variance. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study found that a male-to-female ratio of approximately 1.2:1, including 98 (54.4%) male patients and 82 (45.6%) female patients. Thoracic-level injuries were seen in 82 patients (45.56%), 60 (33.33%) patients had lumbar-level injuries, 18 (8.33%) patients had thoracolumbar-level injuries, and a small number of patients had cervical- or sacral-level injuries. Sixty-two patients (34.44%) demonstrated normal voiding, 65 (36.11%) required manually assisted voiding, 29 (16.11%) required catheterization, and 24 (13.33%) used aurine-collecting apparatus. The prevalence of SUTI was 43.89%. Patients who emptied their bladder via manually assisted voiding, catheterization, or with the use of a urine-collecting apparatus demonstrated higher rates of SUTI compared with patients who voided normally (p < 0.05); the patients who required catheterization had higher rates of SUTI compared with patients who required manually assisted voiding (p < 0.05). When manually assisted voiding and catheterization were compared with the use a urine-collecting apparatus, no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of the risk of developing SUTI. The patients in this study demonstrated low scores on the WHOQOL-BREF physical domain (11.61 ± 3.80), psychological domain (10.11 ± 3.63), social domain (11.46 ± 2.84), and environmental domain (11.86 ± 2.51). The patients who reported normal voiding also demonstrated the best QOL in terms of physical, psychological, and social component scores (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the percentage of women in this study is higher than that reported in other studies on traumatic causes of SCI. Patients who suffered SCI following the Wenchuan earthquake demonstrate poor bladder management status and are unable to take advantage of urodynamic testing that is used to monitor the functional state of the bladder. This study's findings indicate that bladder management methods influence the rate of SUTI and the QOL of patients with SCI. Caring for SCI patients following a disaster requires comprehensive long-term planning. Bladder management of patients with SCI is essential for improving the QOL of these patients. © 2012, Elsevier Taiwan LLC. All rights reserved.

The primary endpoint was the mean percentage change in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (BMDL), and secondary endpoints were the mean percentage changes in left proximal femur bone mineral density (BMDF), serum 25OH vitamin D3 (25(OH)D) concentrations, total lower-extremity manual muscle test (LE MMT) score, and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score. The BMDL, BMDF, total LE MMT score and BBS score were recorded at baseline, 5, 12, and 24 weeks. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured at baseline and 5 weeks. Using a mixed linear model, there was no significant treatment difference between the two groups in the BMDL, BMDF, total LE MMT score, and BBS score (P≥0.05). For 25(OH)D concentrations, the effects were also comparable between the two groups (P≥0.05) with the Mann-Whitney's U-test. These results suggested that a course of PEMFs treatment with specific parameters was as effective as alendronate in treating PMO within 24 weeks.

84877947320	Pulsed electromagnetic field stimulates osteoprotegerin and reduces RANKL expression in ovariectomized rats	Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) has been shown to increase bone mineral density in osteoporosis patients and prevent bone loss in ovariectomized rats. But the mechanisms through which PEMF elicits these favorable biological responses are still not fully understood. Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play a central role in differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of PEMF on RANKL and OPG expression in ovariectomized rats. Thirty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: sham-operated control (Sham), ovariectomy control (OVX), and ovariectomy with PEMF treatment (PEMF). After 12-week interventions, the results showed that PEMF increased serum 17β-estradiol level, reduced serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase level, increased bone mineral density, and inhibited deterioration of bone microarchitecture and strength in OVX rats. Furthermore, PEMF could suppress RANKL expression and improve OPG expression in bone marrow cells of OVX rats. In conclusion, this study suggests that PEMF can prevent ovariectomy-induced bone loss through regulating the expression of RANKL and OPG. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

84878478212	Effects of electro-acupuncture on oestrogen levels, body weight, articular cartilage histology and MMP-13 expression in ovariectomised rabbits	Background: Electro-acupuncture (EA) treatment has been shown to decrease pain and improve the function of ovariectomised (OVX) rats with osteoarthritis (OA); however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Object: We used OVX rabbits to replicate natural human menopausal processes and to evaluate whether EA could be used to prevent and treat postmenopausal OA. Methods: The rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of eight: a normal control group (NC), an OVX group, an ERT group (oestrogen replacement therapy after OVX) and an EA group (EA therapy after OVX). After the interventions, all of the animals were killed. Serum oestrogen levels and body weight were measured. The transcription of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) mRNA was detected using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Modified Mankin scores were used for histological assessment. Expression of MMP-13 in cartilage was determined by immunohistochemistry. Results: Both the EA group and the ERT group had increased serum oestrogen levels (p=0.028, p=0.037 respectively), as well as decreased expression of MMP-13 (p=0.000, p=0.000, respectively), relative to the OVX group. The body weight of the EA group was lower than that of the OVX group and the NC group (p=0.007), as well as the ERT group (p=0.010). Conclusions: EA could be a new method for preventing and treating postmenopausal OA by producing endogenous sex hormones that inhibit the expression of MMP-13 and cause weight loss with no side effects and a relatively low cost.

84891070741	The hemorheological safety of pulsed electromagnetic fields in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in southwest China: A randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial	Apart from medications, pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are used to treat osteoporosis nowadays. However studies on hemorheological safety of PEMFs were scarce. This randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial assessed whether PEMFs could lead to significant hemorheological changes. Fifty-five postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to receive placebo or PEMFs. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and after treatment to measure 14 hemorheological determinants. Independent samples t-test, paired samples t-test and chi-squared tests were performed respectively. Relationships between variables were determined by Pearson correlation analysis. Multiple linear stepwise regression analysis was used to explore predictors of selected determinants. No significant differences existed between the placebo and PEMFs groups for any of the 14 hemorheological determinants (P > 0.05) or the percentage of patients with hemorheological determinant within reference range (P > 0.05). Hematocrit was found to be correlated with BMI (P = 0.007). The most significant predictor of blood reduced viscosity at low shear rate was blood viscosity at low shear rate. And blood reduced viscosity at high shear rate was the most important predictor of plasma viscosity. These results showed, compared with placebo, PEMFs treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis was not associated with adverse changes in hemorheological determinants, which may contribute to venous thromboembolism. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

84894495302	The therapeutic effect of neurac training on patients with cervical radiculopathy: A randomized control trial	Objective To explore the therapeutic effect of Neurac training on patients with cervical radiculopathy (CR). Methods Sixty patients with CR were enrolled and randomly assigned into control group (CG) and Neurac training group (NG) with 30 patients for each group. The patients in CG group received conventional treatments for 2 weeks, including cervical traction, manual therapy and electrical therapy. The patients in NG group received Neurac training as well as conservative treatments for 2 weeks. The pain level and it impact on daily life were assessed by the numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) and the neck disability index NDI before the treatments and at the time of 1 week, 2 weeks after the treatments, respectively. Results Following the treatment, significant improvements for NPRS and NDI were observed in both the two groups at the end of the first and second week. The improvements for both NPRS and NDI were higher in the NG than those in the CG, with P<0.05. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that Neurac training can bring additional therapeutic benefits to conventional treatments for patients with CR.

84893775568	Effects of electroacupuncture on bone mineral density, oestradiol level and osteoprotegerin ligand expression in ovariectomised rabbits	Objectives To investigate the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on the oestradiol level, bone mineral density and osteoprotegerin ligand (OPGL) expression, and to explore whether EA might be a complementary method to prevent and treat osteoporosis. Methods A total of 21 New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: a normal control (NC) group undergoing no surgery or EA; an ovariectomised (OVX) group, in which rabbits were ovariectomised but did not receive EA; an EA group, in which rabbits were ovariectomised and treated with EA. Acupuncture was applied at ST35, BL20 and BL23 points bilaterally. EA (10 Hz, 2 mA) was applied bilaterally at BL20 and BL23 for 30 min a day for 14 days. After 14 days, all animals were killed. OPGL expression level was determined by immunohistochemistry. Blood serum levels of oestradiol were measured by ELISA and bone mineral density was detected by dual-energy xray absorptiometry. Results After ovariectomy, the bone mineral density and oestradiol level decreased significantly in the OVX group compared with the NC group (p=0.001), whereas the OPGL expression level increased. After EA, the bone mineral density and oestradiol level increased compared with the OVX group (p=0.049 and p=0.012, respectively). The OPGL level OPGL level in the EA group was lower than that in the OVX group (p=0.022). Conclusions EA restored bone mineral density towards normal and was associated with increased plasma oestradiol level and reduced OPGL expression in an ovariectomised rabbit model of osteoporosis.

84894174971	Altered resting-state functional and white matter tract connectivity in stroke patients with dysphagia	Background. Swallowing dysfunction is intractable after acute stroke. Our understanding of the alterations in neural networks of patients with neurogenic dysphagia is still developing. Objective. The aim was to investigate cerebral cortical functional connectivity and subcortical structural connectivity related to swallowing in unilateral hemispheric stroke patients with dysphagia. Methods. We combined a resting-state functional connectivity with a white matter tract connectivity approach, recording 12 hemispheric stroke patients with dysphagia, 12 hemispheric stroke patients without dysphagia, and 12 healthy controls. Comparisons of the patterns in swallowing-related functional connectivity maps between patient groups and control subjects included (a) seed-based functional connectivity maps calculated from the primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) to the entire brain, (b) a swallowing-related functional connectivity network calculated among 20 specific regions of interest (ROIs), and (c) structural connectivity described by the mean fractional anisotropy of fibers bound through the SMA and M1. Results. Stroke patients with dysphagia exhibited dysfunctional connectivity mainly in the sensorimotor-insula-putamen circuits based on seed-based analysis of the left and right M1 and SMA and decreased connectivity in the bilateral swallowing-related ROIs functional connectivity network. Additionally, white matter tract connectivity analysis revealed that the mean fractional anisotropy of the white matter tract was significantly reduced, especially in the left-to-right SMA and in the corticospinal tract. Conclusions. Our results indicate that dysphagia secondary to stroke is associated with disruptive functional and structural integrity in the large-scale brain networks involved in motor control, thus providing new insights into the neural remodeling associated with this disorder. © The Author(s) 2013.

84894623058	Altered Defau lt Mode and Affective Network Connectivity in Stroke Patients with and without Dysphagia	Objective: Neuroimaging studies in stroke patients provide substantial evidence for the involvement of widespread cortical and subcortical regions in the control of swallowing. Although the affective network and the default mode network are functionally related to "autonomic" and "volitional" swallowing, little is known about their functional changes in dysphagic stroke patients. Methods: Unbiased seeds functional connectivity analysis was used to study the connectivity patterns of these restingstate networks. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in stroke patients with (n = 12) and without dysphagia (n = 12). Results: Compared with healthy controls, stroke patients with and without dysphagia had decreased functional connectivity in the default mode network and the affective network. Moreover, stroke patients with dysphagia also had decreased functional connectivity in both the default mode network and the affective network relative to patients without dysphagia. Conclusion: The difference in the extent of impairment in the default mode network and affective network of stroke patients with and without dysphagia may lead to improved understanding of the neuropathophysiological mechanism and rehabilitation of dysphagia.Journal Compilation © 2014 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.

84894420409	Arguments and debates about physical therapies for osteoporosis and osteoarthritis	Osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) are primary bone and joint diseases affecting the quality of life of old people. The two diseases are different in pathogenesis but are closely associated from each other. Recent clinical guidelines have recommended physical therapies for OA and OP, which have attracted attentions and debates. This is because there is a lack of quality research into this topic. The available studies have used different measurements, and many have not been able to obtain evidence from human research apart from animal experiments. There is a need to undertake both animal and human studies with a stringent design so that the clinical efficacy and mechanism of physical therapy as well as its safety for OA and OP can be explored. We also need to pay attention to the interactions between various physical factors in order to find the best solutions in physical therapies for OA and OP.

84894428596	Effect of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on cartilage and subchondral bone remodeling in rabbits with ACLT-induced osteoarthritis	Objective To investigate the role of extracorporeal shock wave therapy on the protection of cartilage and subchondral bone remodeling in rabbits with osteoarthritis induced by anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT). Methods Anterior cruciate ligament transaction was performed on 24 adult rabbits to establish knee osteoarthritis models. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups, with one group receiving extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and the other group serving as controls. The ESWT was set at energy 0. 16 MPa/time, frequency 5 Hz, 1 200 shock per side, 3 times per week, and a total of 6 times in 4 weeks. Histological observations were undertaken with articular cartilages under mascroscope and microscope; bone mineral density (BMD) was measured. The subchondral bones of femoralcondyle and tibial plateau were given a bone histomorphometry analysis. The levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nitric oxide (NO) were detected by ELISA. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) in cartilage were determined by RT-PCR. Results Lower levels of histological result in medial femoral condyles (by both mascroscope and microscope examinations) and higher levels of BMD (in distal femora) were found in the ESWT treated rabbits compared with the controls (P<0.05). The ESWT treated rabbits also had decreased trabecular bone relative volume and trabecular bone thickness, increased bone separation, lower levels of expressions of MMP-1 and MMP-3, and higher levels of TIMP-1. Conclusion ESWT can protect cartilage from damages and prevent subchondral sclerosis through regulating MMP-1, MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in cartilages and modulating subchondral bone metabolisms.

84894435351	Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy inhibits chondrocyte apoptosis in rabbits with osteoarthritis	Objective To determine the effect of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment on chondrocyte morphology, chondrocyte apoptosis, and the expression of apoptosis related proteins in rabbits. Methods 24 white New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into three groups; normal control group ( NC group), anterior cruciate ligament transection without treatment (ACLT group), and anterior cruciate ligament transection with pulsed electromagnetic field treatment (PEMF group). Six weeks after anterior cruciate ligament transection, the rabbits in the PEMF group were given 2 weeks of pulsed electromagnetic field treatment. Results Rabbits in the PEMF group had significantly lower Mankin scores than those in the ACLT group, although the scores were higher than that of the NC group. The rabbits in the PEMF groups also had significantly lower levels of apoptosis index of chondrocytes and expression of caspase-3 compared with those in the ACLT group. The expression of caspase-8 in the rabbits in the PEMF group was higher compared to the NC group, but no significant difference compared with that of the ACLT group. Conclusion Pulsed electromagnetic field treatment has therapeutic effect on the experimental osteoarthritis, which is likely a result of inhibition of apoptosis in chondrocytes.

84894436207	The effect of low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields on balance ability of patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis	Objective To assess the effect of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs)on balance ability of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Methods 43 eligible patients were randomly divided into experimental (n = 24) and control (n=19) groups. Patients in both groups received conventional drug therapy. Meanwhile, patients in the experimental group were given PEMFs once a day for 30 days. Results The Berg Balance Scale BBS scores increased and the timed upand to test TUG scores, sway index (forward-backward), rectangle area and sway path decreased in the patients in the experimental group P<0.05). In the patients in the control group, only changes in BBS scores and sway path were statistically significant P<0.05). The decrease of sway index (forward-backward) in the experimental group was greater than that of the control group (P<0.01). Conclusion PEMFs can improve the balance ability of patients with post-menopausal osteoporosis.

84894444893	The estrogen-like and antioxidant effects of pilose antler blood wine in female rats with ovariectomy	Objective To investigate whether pilose antler blood wine has the effects of estrogen-like activity and antioxidant in the ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Methods The rat model of oxidative stress was established by ovariectomy. The female rats were divided into 6 groups: normal control group, OVX group, base wine group, and 3 pilose antler blood wine treated OVX groups low medium and high dose of wine at a dose of 4. 5 g/kg, 9. 1 g/kg and 13. 6 g/kg respectively). After the feeding of pilose antler blood wine (saline in control and OVX group) for 31 days, the serum estrodial level, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the content of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) were measured. Results The one month treatment of daily drink of pilose antler blood wine could significantly promote the serum estrodial level in OVX rats P<0.05). Either low or medium dose could inhibit the decrease of serum SOD activity and the increase of MDA content in OVX rats, and the inhibition effects were more obvious in low dose group compared with high dose group P<0.05). Conclusion The daily drink of pilose antler blood wine showed the effects on increasing estrodial level and antioxidation in OVX rats.

84894450052	Effects of whole body vibration on structural and functional remodeling of subchondral bones in rabbits with early osteoarthritis	Objective To investigate the effects of whole body vibration therapy (WBVT) on structural and functional remodeling of subchondral bone in rabbits with early Osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Twenty-four adult rabbits received anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT) to establish knee osteoarthritis model. The rabbits were randomly divided into two groups, ACLT group and WBVT + ACLT group. The rabbits in the WBVT + ACLT group received whole body vibration treatment (Frequency,40 Hz; Amplitude, 2-4 mm;40 min/d,5 d/week, 4 weeks) two months after surgery. After interventions, the left femur and tibia of all rabbits were placed in a Micro-CT scanning system. The bone volume fraction (BVF), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular spacing (Tb. Sp), trabecular number (Tb. N), volumetric BMD (vBMD), and tissue BMD (tBMD) of the bones of femoral condyle and tibia were analysed using three-dimensional reconstruction Micview V2. 1. 2 and ABA analysis software. Geomagic Studio 11.0 software were used to calculate modulus (EM), reaction force (RF) and average Von Miss stress (VMF). Results Higher levels of BVF, Tb. N, Tb. Th, EM, RF, VMF, vBMD and tBMD and lower levels of Tb. Sp were found in distal femora and tibia of the rabbits in the WBVT+ACLT group compared with the controls (P<0 05). Conclusion WBVT can effectively improve bone microstructure and mechanical properties of rabbits with early knee osteoarthritis.

84899678801	Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms and risk of osteoarthritis: A meta-analysis	The vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms have been reported to be involved in the development of many musculoskeletal disorders, including osteoarthritis (OA). However, results were inconsistent and there is no definite conclusion regarding the association between any VDR polymorphism and the risk of OA. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether BsmI, TaqI, and ApaI polymorphisms in the VDR gene are associated with OA susceptibility. Literature research was performed using PubMed and EMBASE databases. Studies illustrating the association between the three VDR polymorphisms and OA were included, and their qualities were assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Eight eligible studies, recruiting 1626 cases and 2024 controls were identified. Their methodological qualities were generally good, with scores ranging from 6 to 8 points. However, throughout all summary analyses, which were performed for multiple categories and on four contrasts (allele contrast, contrast of homozygotes, recessive and dominant models), none of the VDR BsmI, TaqI, and ApaI gene polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with the risk of OA. On the other hand, there was no significant publication bias. Results from this meta-analysis suggested that the VDR BsmI, TaqI, and ApaI gene polymorphisms might not be important predictors of OA. More studies further investigating these associations, especially taking into account of gene-gene, gene-environment interactions, and other confounding factors are warranted. © 2014 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

84904703972	Effects of Tai Chi on balance and fall prevention in Parkinson's disease: A randomized controlled trial	Objectives: To examine the effects of Tai Chi on balance and functional mobility in people with Parkinson's disease, and determine whether fall incidence could be reduced by the Tai Chi exercise. Design: Single blinded randomized control trial with 6 months' follow-up. Setting: A hospital and general community. Participants: Patients (n=76) diagnosed with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, over 40 years old, able to walk independently and fell at least one time during the past 12 months. Interventions: The Tai Chi group (n=37) received 24-form Yang style Tai Chi exercise for 60 minutes each time, three times a week and lasted for 12 weeks. The control group (n=39) received no intervention. Main outcome measures: Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III, Timed Up&Go (TUG) and occurrences of falls. Results: The Tai Chi group improved more than the control group on the BBS (p<0.05), but there was no difference on UPDRS III scores and Timed Up&Go (p>0.05). During the 6-month follow-up, only 8 (21.6%) out of 37 patients in the Tai Chi group had experience of falls comparing to 19 (48.7%) out of 39 patients in the control group (p<0.05). The average times of falls were 0.30±0.62 in the Tai Chi group compared with 0.64±0.74 in the control group (p<0.05). Conclusions: Our findings suggested that Tai Chi exercise could improve the balance and decrease the fall risks in patients with Parkinson's disease. © The Author(s) 2014.
