84927725498	A novel process to prepare a thin silica shell on the PDDA-stabilized spherical Au nanoparticles assisted by UV light irradiation	A modified polyol process is a convenient route to prepare monodispersed, uniform spherical Au nanospheres stabilized by Poly Diallyl Dimethyl Ammonium Chloride (PDDA). However, Au nanospheres with PDDA coatings possess a high zeta potential and such PDDA coatings can not be removed easily, leading to a difficulty in coating a silica layer on surfaces of Au nanospheres, further resulting in the limitation of the applications of these monodispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we develop a novel route to coat a silica layer on PDDA stabilized Au nanospheres assisted by UV light irradiation without the use of a silane coupling agent as the surface primer. PDDA-stabilized Au nanospheres showed high a positive zeta potential (36.7 mV), which is disadvantageous to coat a layer of thin silica shell. In our strategy, UV light irradiation with high power was applied to PDDA stabilized Au nanoparticles and part of PDDA on Au nanoparticles was degradated, producing lower positive zeta potential (14.7 mV), which guaranteed that silica shell could be easily formed on the surface of Au sphere under such a low zeta potential. The thickness of silica shell could be successfully tuned from 2 nm to 8 nm by adjusting the concentration of TEOS. As far as we know, this is first report to coat the silica layer on PDDA stabilized Au nanospheres. Such monodispersed Au spherical nanoparticles with controlled silica coatings could be extended to important applications in SERS applications, electrochemistry after self-assembled into monolayer particle arrays.

9444249906	Small adaptive optical imaging system for cells of living human retina	By using adaptive optics technology, two sets of high-resolution imaging systems for living human retina have been developed. High-resolution imaging of living human retina in scale of cell is realized. In these systems, two novel types of 19- and 37-element small PZT deformable mirrors are used as wavefront correctors respectively, and wavefront errors are measured by Hartman-Shack wavefront sensors. Light of diode laser reflected from the eye retina is used as the beacon for wavefront sensing. After the wavefront error of human eye is corrected by the adaptive optics system under the control of a computer, a flash lamp is triggered to illuminate the retina. The high resolution images are captured by a CCD camera. The residual errors are less than λ/6 and λ/10 respectively. The corresponding resolutions at retina are 3.4 μm and 2.6 μm respectively, approaching the diffraction limit. Experiments show that the resolution of the 37-element system is better than the 19-element system.

For most of AO systems there is a time delay in wavefront sensing and processing, and the bandwidths will be limited by the time delay. In this paper, three kinds of transfer functions (close-loop, open-loop and error transfer functions) for an AO system with time delay are analyzed. The four criteria of bandwidths are defined and compared between a simple proportional-integral (PI) control algorithm and a Smith control algorithm. By using the Smith algorithm, the bandwidths are improved. The experimental results of the transfer functions and bandwidths with our newly developed 61 elements system are also presented.

33645167777	Numerical simulation of wavefront phase screen distorted by atmospheric turbulence	Based on power spectrum method and Fourier transform and Zernike polynomial method, numerical simulation of wavefront phase screen (PS) distorted by Kolmogonov atmospheric turbulence is implemented. Accuracy of PS is determined by comparing the phase structure function and the theoretical results. The analysis shows that the high spatial frequency components of PS generated by power spectrum method accord with theoretical results and low spatial frequency components significantly deviate from theory value. The situation can be efficiently improved based on addition of subharmonics generally with a result of 4-order subharmonics. Low spatial frequency components of PS generated by Zernike polynomial method accord with theoretical results, while the lack of high spatial frequency components can be compensated with the increase of Zernike order at the cost of computation enlargement.

Power spectra reject function, which defines as the ratio of the power spectra function of the close-loop compensated wavefront to the open-loop disturbed wavefront, was used to describe the control effect of an adaptive optical system. In this paper the control effect of the Zernike wavefront modals for an adaptive optical system using direct-gradient wavefront reconstruction algorithm was analyzed by using the power spectra reject function of Zernike model coefficients. The dynamic models of Zernike modal compensation for the direct-gradient algorithm were established. The power spectra reject functions were calculated from the theoretic model and compared with those gotten from experimental data. It is showed that there is coupling between some Zernike modals while using the direct-gradient algorithm. Although the control bandwidth was affected slightly, the power spectra reject function of the coupled Zernike modals become worse at low frequency range, this causes the wavefront compensation effect descended to some degree.

Appropriate stochastic parallel optimization control algorithm is the key to correcting distorted wave front successfully. Based on several stochastic parallel optimization control algorithms, an adaptive optics system with a 32-element deformable mirror was simulated. Genetic algorithm (GA), the unilateral perturbation stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD), the bilateral perturbation SPGD and simulated annealing (SA) were compared in convergence speed, correction capability and local maximum.

41149170735	High resolution imaging of phase-distorted extended object using SPGD algorithm and deformable mirror	The conventional adaptive optics (AO) technique based on phase conjugate principle requires the information about a reference wave front that corresponds to the undistorted image when it is applied to extended source image correction. The AO technique based on the image function appears more promising than the conventional AO for this application. The success of this technique depends on an appropriate image quality criterion and a suitable control algorithm. We tried to find a convenient image performance metric not from additional optics elements, but only from the distorted image which is a gray level image. Simulation results showed the variance function of gray level presents more potential than other ways, such as ways based on the information about the gray level gradient of each pixel. Based on SPGD algorithm, an AO system was simulated with a 61-element deformable mirror and the above resultant image quality criterion. The correction capability of the AO system was investigated through different images and different level aberrations. Numerical simulation results verified the performance metric we used is effective. The system can correct different level disturbed images successfully when parameters of the algorithm were appropriate for static distorted wave-fronts.

Reconstructed results in cases of three distributions-tilt, ring, random-type near-field intensity distribution are compared with uniform intensity respectively. The results show that the reconstructed effect of tilt-type which is composed of odd functions is adverse; while the reconstructed effect of ring and random-type which is composed of even functions is not large. Especially when the spatial frequency was higher, the reconstructed effects are smaller. In addition, near-field intensity and phase obtained from atmospheric turbulence distortion are simulated by using the linear phase retrieval algorithm. Near-field intensity distribution of the results have influence on the reconstruction, but the influence is not too great.

77349095721	The control method of close-loop adaptive optical system with multi-wavefront-correctors	The control method of close-loop adaptive optical (AO) system with single wavefront sensor and multi-wavefront-correctors was proposed. The wave aberration was measured using single wavefront sensor. The wavefront aberrance was decomposed to lower rank wave aberrations and higher rank residual error by decoupling method and algorithm of limitative correction. In this way, different types of wave aberrations are corrected by different wavefront correctors respectively. The wavefront correctors with little elements are used to correct low spatial frequency wave aberration using Zernike wavefront modal algorithm. The wavefront corrector with more elements is used to correct the residual high spatial frequency wavefront error using direct gradient wavefront control algorithm. An adaptive optical system using a single Hartman wavefront sensor (HS) with 96 sub-apertures to control 19-element deformable mirror (DM), 61-element deformable mirror and 127-element deformable mirror has been numerical simulated. It is proved that this method can improve the compensation ability of an adaptive optical system.

The coupling efficiency with which the received laser beam can be coupled into a single-mode fiber is noticeably limited by atmospheric turbulence due to the degradation of its spatial coherence. Fortunately, adaptive optics (AO) can alleviate this limitation by partially correcting the turbulence-distorted wavefront. The coupling efficiency improvement provided by Zernike modal AO correction is numerically evaluated. It is found that the first 3-20 corrected polynomials can considerably improve the fiber-coupling efficiency. The improvement brought by AO is compared with that brought by a coherent fiber array. Finally, a hybrid technique that integrates AO and a coherent fiber array is proposed.

0036992608	Comparing between zonal reconstruction algorithms and modal reconstruction algorithms in adaptive optics system	In this paper, the compensation effects of sub-aperture gradients of Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor in an adaptive optics (AO) system with four different reconstruction algorithms were analyzed. A kind of optimal-gradient reconstruction algorithm was deduced from least-square (LS) reconstruction algorithm by consider the statistical characteristics of atmospheric turbulence and measurement noise. A kind of sensor-eigen (SE) modal reconstruction algorithm was deduced from LS reconstruction algorithm by orthogonalizing the statistical correlation matrix of drive voltages by means of singular value decomposition (SVD) method. Two kinds of zonal reconstruction algorithms, the LS reconstruction algorithm and the optimal-gradient reconstruction algorithm, along with two modal reconstruction algorithms, the Zernike modal reconstruction algorithm and the SE modal reconstruction algorithm, were compared together on a 61-element AO system working in atmospheric turbulence. Performance of the four reconstruction algorithms were calculated and analyzed in different work conditions. It is showed that zonal reconstruction algorithms can achieve better compensation, but the modal reconstruction algorithms can achieve better stability. Zonal reconstruction algorithms are suitable in general condition, but the modal reconstruction algorithm with ability of partial compensation will be better in lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) condition.

The TT control is performed using the adaptive fiber-optics collimator (AFOC), and the PL control is realized by the phase modulator (PM). Cascaded and simultaneous controls of TT and PL using stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm are investigated in this paper. Two-fiber-laser-, four-fiber-laser-, and six-fiber-laser-arrays are employed to study the TT and PL control. In the cascaded control system, only one high-speed CMOS camera is used to collect beam data and a computer is used as the controller. In a simultaneous control system one high-speed CMOS camera and one photonic detector (PD) are employed, and a computer and a control circuit based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) are used as the controllers. Experimental results reveal that both cascaded and simultaneous controls of TT using AFOC and PL using PM in fiber laser array are feasible and effective. Cascaded control is more effective in static control situation and simultaneous control can be applied to the dynamic control system directly The control signals of simultaneous PL and TT disturb each other obviously and TT and PL control may compete with each other, so the control effect is limited. © 2013 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

84875602883	Measurement of non-common path static aberrations in an interferometric camera by phase diversity	LINC-NIRVANA (LN) is a near-infrared image-plane beam combiner with advanced, multi-conjugated adaptive optics for the Large Binocular Telescope. Non-common path aberrations (NCPAs) between the near-infrared science camera and the wave-front sensor (WFS) are unseen by the WFS and therefore are not corrected in closed loop. This would prevent LN from achieving its ultimate performance. We use a modified phase diversity technique to measure the internal optical static aberrations and hence the NCPAs. Phase diversity is a methodology for estimating wave-front aberrations by solving an unconstrained optimization problem from multiple images whose pupil phases differ from one another by a known amount. We conduct computer simulations of the reconstruction of aberrations of an optical system with the phase diversity method. In the reconstruction, we fit the wave-front to Zernike polynomials to reduce the number of variables. The limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is very well suited to phase diversity (PD) due to its good performance in solving large scale optimization problems. The main constraint for the implementation of PD for LN is that we cannot add extra components to the internal interferometric camera imaging system to obtain infocus and defocus images. In this paper, we introduce a new method, namely shifting the focal plane source, not the detector, to overcome this constraint. Some experiments were done to test and verify this method and the results are presented and discussed. The study shows that the method is very flexible and the paper gives practical guidelines for the application of phase diversity methods to characterize adaptive optics systems. © 2012 SPIE.

MACA, unlike the traditional control algorithm, considers the effect of atmospheric turbulence and the system time delay together with the dynamic characteristics of AO system. The control parameters in each control loop can be modified timely during iterative calculation, which can make the system work at the best control state. Taking a 61-element AO system as an example, based on numerical simulation, MACA is studied to control the voltages of deformable mirror in advance. Analyses are made on convergence, control performance and control bandwidth of this algorithm. Compared with the classical proportional integral (PI) control algorithm, simulation results show that the residual error caused by turbulence in the system is reduced more effectively by using MACA which has good adaptability and improves the closed-loop control bandwidth and control properties of AO system.

The results show that accurately measurement results of far-field spot quality are premised on adequately high SNR; if the SNR and turbulence strength are fixed, the threshold method of subtracting average background voltage of CCD and reserving random noise is the better choice to obtain the higher calculation accuracy of spot quality.

A stochastic parallel gradient descent algorithm is employed as the tip/tilt control strategy. The tip/tilt control makes four separate laser beams overlap with each other in the far-field, and the average of normalized power-in-bucket increases from 0.171 in open loop to 0.798 in closed loop when 1.5-kW total output power is achieved. The precise tracking ability and control accuracy of this BC system are investigated. Experimental results expose that thermal-blooming effect disturbs BC seriously when the total output power is up to kW-level, which could be mitigated by inducing air flow near the laser output. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

The influence of piston on coherent beam combination was analyzed too. It's demonstrated that the influence of piston on CBC(coherent beam combination) was small if each wavelet has many other higher order aberrations. The relationship between the averaged beam quality factor β of all wavelets and beam quality factor β of CBC based on these wavelets was also obtained by numerical calculation. A fitting formula was used to fit the discrete data. By this way, an expression of the relationship was acquired. Fitting coefficients between numerical calculation and theoretical result were compared and the affecting factor of the difference was analyzed. We concluded that fitting coefficients of numerical calculation result was smaller than theoretical result because of wavelet arrangement and filling ratio. © 2012 SPIE.

84881061681	Prediction control algorithm for close-loop adaptive optical system	To reduce the effect of servo lag error in the close-loop adaptive optics system (AOS), a prediction control algorithm (PCA) is proposed in this paper. We describe a linear predictive controller that uses the historical voltages of deformable mirror to predict their future voltages in advance. The parameters of the predictor are optimized in real time by a modified Recursive Least-Square (RLS) algorithm. Numerical simulations are carried out to show the significant improvements brought by the predictor. The close-loop Strehl Ratio of the residual wave-front error and the power spectrum density of the residual voltages of deformable mirror are calculated as the evaluation criterions. The comparison results between the PCA and the classical proportional integral (PI) control algorithm show that the residual errors caused by servo lag in the system could be more effectively reduced by using the PCA than using the classical PI control algorithm. In addition, the control bandwidth of AOS is improved by using the PCA. © 2013 IFAC.

Atmospheric turbulence aberration can act on optical communication system, which leads to bit error and is independent of system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Simulation results note that bit error is prone to emerge in the case of infinite SNR, when the peak-to-valley (PV) value of wave-front of received optical signal is greater than one wavelength. And the PV value of wave-front is strictly required with the decreasing of SNR. In addition, coherent mixing efficiency decreases rapidly, which is caused by the intensity fluctuation and phase aberration, consequently, resulting in the system bit error rate increasing.

Compared with the conventional power-in-the-bucket (PIB) cost function for SPGD optimization, the tip/tilt control using divergence cost function ensures wider correction range, automatic switching control of program, and freedom of camera's intensity-saturation. Homemade piezoelectric-ring phase-modulator (PZT PM) and adaptive fiber-optics collimator (AFOC) are developed to correct piston-and tip/tilt-type aberrations, respectively. The PIB cost function is employed for phase-locking via maximization of SPGD optimization, while the divergence cost function is used for tip/tilt control via minimization. An average of 432-?rad of divergence metrics in open loop has decreased to 89-?rad when tip/tilt control implemented. In CBC, the power in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the main lobe increases by 32 times, and the phase residual error is less than ?/15. ©2013 Optical Society of America.

In this paper, we verified a new adaptive-optic device named adaptive fiber coupler (AFC) which could compensate angular jitters and improve the SMF coupling efficiency in some degree. Experiments of SMF coupling under the angular jitter situation using AFC have been achieved.

By using new developed natural star Hartmann-Shack (HS) sensor and artificial beacon HS sensor, the temporal synchronized turbulence-induced wavefronts measurement is achieved on telescope system for natural star and Rayleigh-LGS. Accordingly our experimental investigation of Rayleigh-LGS anisoplanatism effect with different LGS-modes (including focal anisoplanatism and angular & focal anisoplanatism) is presented. The experimental results show that, increasing the Zernike order of turbulence-distorted wavefront aberration makes the temporal correlation for corresponding aberration mode between natural star and Rayleigh-LGS with different altitudes present an oscillation downward trend. Comparing with the Zernike variances of natural star wavefront, the modal anisoplanatic error of Rayleigh-LGS increases with the increase of the Zernike order, which is greatly sensitive to high-order aberration. At last the comparisons of our former numerical-modeling and experimental-measuring results of different-mode Rayleigh-LGS anisoplanatic error's impact on the corrected light-wave quality are analyzed, and both of the results are in good agreement. This investigation is a useful promotion of our perceptive knowledge of Rayleigh-LGS anisoplanatic effect in turbulence probing.
