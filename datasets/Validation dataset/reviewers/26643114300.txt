8744291229	Gauss-Seidel-type methods for energy states of a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate	In this paper, we propose two iterative methods, a Jacobi-type iteration (JI) and a Gauss-Seidel-type iteration (GSI), for the computation of energy states of the time-independent vector Gross-Pitaevskii equation (VGPE) which describes a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A discretization of the VGPE leads to a nonlinear algebraic eigen-value problem (NAEP). We prove that the GSI method converges locally and linearly to a solution of the NAEP if and only if the associated minimized energy functional problem has a strictly local minimum. The GSI method can thus be used to compute ground states and positive bound states, as well as the corresponding energies of a multi-component BEC. Numerical experience shows that the GSI converges much faster than JI and converges globally within 10-20 steps. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1542349012	Robust and Minimum Norm Partial Pole Assignment in Vibrating Structures with Aerodynamics Effects	The paper considers a practical solution of the partial eigenvalue assignment problem in a cubic matrix polynomial arising from modeling of vibrating structures with aerodynamics effects, with a special attention to numerically robust feedback design and obtaining feedback matrices with minimum norms. To this end, a direct parametric method that works exclusively with the coefficient matrices of the cubic polynomial without requiring transformation to a standard state-space form is proposed first. The computational requirements of the method are minimal -all thatare needed are solutions of a small Sylvester equation and a small linear algebraic system, both of the same order as the number of eigenvalues to be reassigned. The parametric nature of the method is then exploited to deal with the issues of robustness and minimum feedback norms, by formulating the problem as an unconstrained optimization problem. The numerical effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by results of a numerical experiment performed on simulated data obtained from the Boeing Company.

14544271523	Robust partial pole assignment for vibrating systems with aerodynamic effects	This paper proposes a novel algorithm for Robust Partial Eigenvalue Assignment (RPEVA) problem for a cubic matrix pencil arising from modeling of vibrating systems with aerodynamic effects. The RPEVA problem for a cubic pencil is the one of choosing suitable feedback matrices to reassign a few (say k < 3n) unwanted eigenvalues while leaving the remaining large number (3n - k) of them unchanged, in such a way that the the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix are as insensitive as possible to small perturbation of the data. The latter amounts to minimizing the condition number of the closed-loop eigenvector matrix. The problem is solved directly in the cubic matrix polynomial setting without making any transformation to a standard first-order state-space system. This allows us to take advantage of the exploitable structures such as the sparsity, definiteness, bandness, etc., very often offered by large practical problems. The major computational requirements are: (i)solutions of a small Sylvester equation, (ii) QR factorizations, and (iii) solutions of some standard least squares problems. The least-squares problems result from matrix rank-one and rank-two update techniques used in the algorithm for reassigning, respectively, simple and complex eigenvalues. The practical effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by implementational results on simulated data provided by the Boeing company.

1942539329	Numerical simulation of three dimensional pyramid quantum dot	We present a simple and efficient numerical method for the simulation of the three-dimensional pyramid quantum dot heterostructure. The pyramid-shaped quantum dot is placed in a computational box with uniform mesh in Cartesian coordinates. The corresponding Schrödinger equation is discretized using the finite volume method and the interface conditions are incorporated into the discretization scheme without explicitly enforcing them. The resulting matrix eigenvalue problem is then solved using a Jacobi-Davidson based method. Both linear and non-linear eigenvalue problems are simulated. The scheme is 2nd order accurate and converges extremely fast. The superior performance is a combined effect of the uniform spacing of the grids and the nice structure of the resulting matrices. We have successfully simulated a variety of test problems, including a quintic polynomial eigenvalue problem with more than 32 million variables. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

0005540367	Improved bound for rank revealing LU factorizations	In many applications it is necessary to determine the rank (or numerical rank) of a matrix. Many of these situations involve matrices that are very large order or that are sparse or that may undergo some form of modification (rank-k update, row or column appended or removed). In these cases the singular value decomposition's cost may be prohibitively high or the decomposition may not be computationally feasible (especially for large sparse problems). We thus examine the theoretical merits of rank revealing LU (RRLU) factorizations. We find that in those cases where the nullity is small and the gap is well defined, an RRLU factorization could be a very useful tool. © Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

In this paper, a very efficient, non-iterative algorithm is adapted for estimating the minimum singular value of the triangular factor of the Jacobian matrix as a voltage stability index. This algorithm can be implemented easily based on the conventional power flow program. Only very limited extra memory is required during the computational process. In addition, its computation cost is rather cheap even compared with the existing efficient singular value decomposition method especially while applied to a large power system.

0031128555	The shift-inverted J-Lanczos algorithm for the numerical solutions of large sparse algebraic Riccati equations	The goal of solving an algebraic Riccati equation is to find the stable invariant subspace corresponding to all the eigenvalues lying in the open left-half plane. The purpose of this paper is to propose a structure-preserving Lanczos-type algorithm incorporated with shift and invert techniques, named shift-inverted J-Lanczos algorithm, for computing the stable invariant subspace for large sparse Hamiltonian matrices. The algorithm is based on the J-tridiagonalization procedure of a Hamiltonian matrix using symplectic similarity transformations. We give a detailed analysis on the convergence behavior of the J-Lanczos algorithm and present error bound analysis and Paige-type theorem. Numerical results for the proposed algorithm applied to a practical example arising from the position and velocity control for a string of high-speed vehicles are reported.

23844552570	A continuation BSOR-Lanczos-Galerkin method for positive bound states of a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate	We develop a continuation block successive over-relaxation (BSOR)-Lanczos-Galerkin method for the computation of positive bound states of time-independent, coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (CGPEs) which describe a multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). A discretization of the CGPEs leads to a nonlinear algebraic eigenvalue problem (NAEP). The solution curve with respect to some parameter of the NAEP is then followed by the proposed method. For a single-component BEC, we prove that there exists a unique global minimizer (the ground state) which is represented by an ordinary differential equation with the initial value. For a multi-component BEC, we prove that m identical ground/bound states will bifurcate into m different ground/bound states at a finite repulsive inter-component scattering length. Numerical results show that various positive bound states of a two/three-component BEC are solved efficiently and reliably by the continuation BSOR-Lanczos-Galerkin method. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown that the complete reachability of an open loop periodic system is equivalent to the possibility of assigning an arbitrary set of the eigenvalues to the system by choosing the suitable periodic proportional-derivative feedback. A computational approach is also proposed to solve the problem, which uses the reliable numerical techniques based on the orthogonal transformations.

The ground state solutions bifurcate into two symmetric solutions with respect to some suitable axis on the symmetric domain, when a two-component BEC has equal intra- and inter-component scattering lengths. Furthermore, we show that the ground/positive bound states repel each other and form segregated nodal domains when the repulsive scattering length goes to infinity.

27944459643	A closed-form solution for wave propagation in optical waveguides of longitudinally invariant structures without using beam propagation algorithm	In this paper, we propose a different method to study wave propagation in longitudinally invariant waveguides with arbitrary index profile. In our method, both the electric field and the refractive index profile are expanded into two Fourier cosine series. With these series substituted into the wave equation, a differential matrix equation can then be obtained. We show here that such a matrix equation can be solved and an explicit expression for the wave field at any longitudinal position along an optical waveguide can be obtained. The solution proposed in this method can thus exclude the use of the beam propagation algorithm. This study demonstrates that our approach yields the same results as those obtained by using commercial softwares in which a beam propagation method with the Padé approximation is used. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.

29344432988	Symmetry preserving eigenvalue embedding in finite-element model updating of vibrating structures	The eigenvalue embedding problem addressed in this paper is the one of reassigning a few troublesome eigenvalues of a symmetric finite-element model to some suitable chosen ones, in such a way that the updated model remains symmetric and the remaining large number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original model is to remain unchanged. The problem naturally arises in stabilizing a large-scale system or combating dangerous vibrations, which can be responsible for undesired phenomena such as resonance, in large vibrating structures. A new computationally efficient and symmetry preserving method and associated theories are presented in this paper. The model is updated using low-rank symmetric updates and other computational requirements of the method include only simple operations such as matrix multiplications and solutions of low-order algebraic linear systems. These features make the method practical for large-scale applications. The results of numerical experiments on the simulated data obtained from the Boeing company and on some benchmark examples are presented to show the accuracy of the method. Computable error bounds for the updated matrices are also given by means of rigorous mathematical analysis. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This method allows the simultaneous approximation to the minimal nonnegative solutions of the NARE and its dual equation, requiring only the solutions to two linear systems and several matrix multiplications per iteration. Similar to Newton's method and the fixed-point iteration methods for solving NAREs, we also establish global convergence for SDA under suitable conditions, using only elementary matrix theory. We show that sequences of matrices generated by SDA are monotonically increasing and quadratically convergent to the minimal nonnegative solutions of the NARE and its dual equation. Numerical experiments show that the SDA algorithm is feasible and effective, and outperforms Newton's iteration and the fixed-point iteration methods.

33947697703	Updating quadratic models with no spillover effect on unmeasured spectral data	Model updating concerns the modification of an existing but inaccurate model with measured data. For models characterized by quadratic pencils, the measured data usually involve incomplete knowledge of natural frequencies, mode shapes, or other spectral information. In conducting the updating, it is often desirable to match only the part of observed data without tampering with the other part of unmeasured or unknown eigenstructure inherent in the original model. Such an updating, if possible, is said to have no spillover. Model updating with no spillover has been a very challenging task in applications. This paper provides a complete theory on when such an updating with no spillover is possible. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.

34547140172	A numerical method for a generalized algebraic Riccati equation	In this paper we develop a numerical method for computing the semistabilizing solution of a generalized algebraic Riccati equation (GARE). The semistabilizing solution of such a GARE has been used to characterize the solvability of the (J, J′)-spectral factorization problem for general rational matrices which have poles and zeros on the extended imaginary axis. The main difficulty for solving such a GARE is that its associated skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian pencil has eigenvalues on the extended imaginary axis; consequently, it is not clear which eigenspace of the associated skew-Hamiltonian/Hamiltonian pencil can characterize the desired semistabilizing solution; i.e., it is not clear which eigenvectors and principal vectors corresponding to the eigenvalues on the extended imaginary axis should be contained in the eigenspace that we wish to compute, and hence the well-known generalized eigenvalue approach for the classical algebraic Riccati equations cannot be directly employed for it. Our proposed method consists of computations of the eigendecomposition of the system pencil corresponding to the eigenvalues on the extended imaginary axis and the stable eigenspace of an augmented matrix pencil; hence, it is a generalization of the generalized eigenvalue approach for the classical algebraic Riccati equations. © 2006 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

We prove that the asymptotic synchronization occurs provided that the coupled system is pointwise dissipativeness and the coupling coefficients are sufficiently large. As an illustration of the application, particular attention is paid to the asymptotic synchronization of coupled Lorenz equations with Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic boundary conditions, respectively.

84877326511	Structure-preserving Arnoldi-type algorithm for solving eigenvalue problems in leaky surface wave propagation	We study the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) that arise from modeling leaky surface wave propagation in an acoustic resonator with an infinite amount of periodically arranged interdigital transducers. The constitutive equations are discretized by finite element methods with mesh refinements along the electrode interfaces and corners. The nonzero eigenvalues of the resulting GEP appear in reciprocal pairs (λ,1/λ). We transform the GEP into a T-palindromic quadratic eigenvalue problem (TPQEP) to reveal the important reciprocal relationships of the eigenvalues. The TPQEP is then solved by a structure-preserving algorithm incorporating a generalized T-skew-Hamiltonian implicitly restarted Arnoldi method so that the reciprocal relationship of the eigenvalues may be automatically preserved. Compared with applying the Arnoldi method to solve the GEPs, our numerical results show that the eigenpairs produced by the proposed structure-preserving method not only preserve the reciprocal property but also possess high efficiency and accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In the method, the cross-section of a rib-type waveguide is divided into several regions. In each region, the refractive index profile and field distribution are expanded into Fourier cosine series, and then are substituted in the wave equation. A second-order differential matrix equation is then derived for each region, with a closed-form solution obtainable. With the boundary conditions used, an eigenmode equation for the rib waveguide can be derived and solved numerically to give the modal indices. Here, the presented method is used to deal with two rib waveguides in different geometric dimensions and/or compositions, respectively. Computational results show that the presented method is quite efficient, in terms of CPU time, in finding the modal indices accurately.

We then show that the change of local optimality occurs only at the bifurcation points. The fact leads to a minimal energy tracking method that guides the choice of bifurcation branch corresponding to the minimal energy solution curve. By combining all these techniques with a parameter-switching scheme, we successfully compute a non-radially symmetric energy minimizer that can not be computed by existing numerical schemes straightforwardly. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This method is based on the concept of minimization of residuals by the Bi-CGSTAB algorithm, so that the convergence can be enforced by varying the time-step size. The numerical results show that the time-step size determined by the proposed method improves the convergence rate for turbulent computations using advanced turbulence models in low Reynolds-number form, and the degree of improvement increases with the degree of the complexity of the turbulence models. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons.

0035484766	Chaotic behaviors of bistable laser diodes and its application in synchronization of optical communication	Period-doubling routes to chaos behavior in bistable laser diodes is examined numerically. An external sinusoidal electronic drive is injected to generate chaotic light output. Phase portrait, Poincaré map, bifurcation diagram, and Lyapunov exponent are then calculated to assert the existence of chaos. Furthermore, according to Pecora and Carroll's theory, a drive-response system is constructed by using the bistable laser diodes to mask the sinusoidal electronic signal with chaotic light. Synchronization can be achieved for optical simplex and duplex transmissions using bistable laser diodes. The proposed synchronization scheme between two separate chaotic systems provides a key step toward optical chaotic communication.

72449157410	Quadratic model updating with symmetry, positive definiteness, and no spill-over	Updating a system modeled as a real symmet ric quadratic eigenvalue problem to match observed spectral information has been an important task for practitioners in different disciplines. It is often desirable in the process to match only the newly measured data without tampering with the other unmeasured and often unknown eigenstructure i nherent in the original model. Such an updating, known as no spill-over, has been critical yet chall enging in practice. Only recently, a mathematical theory on updating with no spill-over has begun to be understood. However, other imperative issues such as maintaining positive definiteness in t he coefficient matrices remain to be addressed. This paper highlights several theoretical aspects about updating that preserves both no spill-over and positive definiteness of the mass and the stiffness matrices. In particular, some necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability conditions are established in this investigation. © 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

77950865110	A hyperplane-constrained continuation method for near singularity in coupled nonlinear Schrödinger equations	The continuation method is a useful numerical tool for solving differential equations to obtain multiform solutions and allow bifurcation analysis. However, when a standard continuation method is used to solve a type of time-independent m-coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations that can be used to model nonlinear optics, nearly singular systems arise in the computations of prediction and correction search directions and detections of bifurcations. To overcome the stability and efficiency problems that exist in standard continuation methods, we propose a new hyperplane-constrained continuation method by adding additional constraints to prevent the singularities while tracking the solution curves. Aimed at the 3-coupled DNLS equations, we conduct theoretical analysis to the solutions and bifurcations on the primal stalk solution curve. The proposed algorithms have been implemented successfully to demonstrate numerical solution profiles, energies, and bifurcation diagrams in various settings. © 2010 IMACS.

We give a rigourous proof for the occurrence of chaotic synchronization of spatially homogeneous solutions in such coupled map lattices (CMLs) of lattice size n=4 with suitable coupling coefficients. For the case of lattice size n>4, we demonstrate numerical results of synchronized chaotic behaviour of the CMLs. Moreover, we show numerically that the difference between two variables manifests chaotic behaviour. This behaviour combined with the special coupling method in the CMLs guarantees high security in applications using our new model. © 2009 The Author.

77956892283	Preconditioning bandgap eigenvalue problems in three-dimensional photonic crystals simulations	To explore band structures of three-dimensional photonic crystals numerically, we need to solve the eigenvalue problems derived from the governing Maxwell equations. The solutions of these eigenvalue problems cannot be computed effectively unless a suitable combination of eigenvalue solver and preconditioner is chosen. Taking eigenvalue problems due to Yee's scheme as examples, we propose using Krylov-Schur method and Jacobi-Davidson method to solve the resulting eigenvalue problems. For preconditioning, we derive several novel preconditioning schemes based on various preconditioners, including a preconditioner that can be solved by Fast Fourier Transform efficiently. We then conduct intensive numerical experiments for various combinations of eigenvalue solvers and preconditioning schemes. We find that the Krylov-Schur method associated with the Fast Fourier Transform based preconditioner is very efficient. It remarkably outperforms all other eigenvalue solvers with common preconditioners like Jacobi, Symmetric Successive Over Relaxation, and incomplete factorizations. This promising solver can benefit applications like photonic crystal structure optimization. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

78649324592	Exploring bistability in rotating BoseEinstein condensates by a quotient transformation invariant continuation method	We study the discrete nonlinear Schrdinger (DNLS) equations that model rotating BoseEinstein Condensates (BEC) both analytically and numerically. Due to the difficulties associated with transformation invariant solutions, standard continuation methods may not properly follow the solution curves of the DNLS equations. We propose a quotient transformation invariant continuation method to circumvent this obstacle. We also analyze the bifurcation properties of the primal stalk solution curve corresponding to the DNLS equations for an isotropic trap. In numerical computation, the existence of a bistable region corresponding to the bound states with a 0- or 1-vortex is shown. This finding not only agrees with the physics of the experimental phenomena, but also explains why a 0- or 1-vortex may be observed within a certain region that has an angular velocity. Numerical evidence shows that trap potentials have little effect on the width of the bistable regions. In contrast, intra-component scattering length significantly affects the bistable region. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

78650419105	Randomness enhancement using digitalized modified logistic map	In this brief, a nonlinear digitalized modified logistic map-based pseudorandom number generator (DMLM-PRNG) is proposed for randomness enhancement. Two techniques, i.e., constant parameter selection and output sequence scrambling, are employed to reduce the computation cost without sacrificing the complexity of the output sequence. Statistical test results show that with only one multiplication, DMLM-PRNG passes all cases in SP800-22. Moreover, it passes most of the cases in Crush, one of the test suites of TesuU01. When compared with solutions based on digitized pseudochaotic maps previously proposed in the literature, in terms of randomness quality, our system is as good as a Rnyi-map-based PRNG and better than a logistic-map-based PRNG. Moreover, compared with solutions based on a Rnyi-map-based PRNG, DMLM-PRNG is better scalable to high digital resolutions with reasonable area overhead. © 2010 IEEE.

78651507916	Efficient Arnoldi-type algorithms for rational eigenvalue problems arising in fluid-solid systems	We develop and analyze efficient methods for computing damped vibration modes of an acoustic fluid confined in a cavity with absorbing walls capable of dissipating acoustic energy. The discretization in terms of pressure nodal finite elements gives rise to a rational eigenvalue problem. Numerical evidence shows that there are no spurious eigenmodes for such discretization and also confirms that the discretization based on nodal pressures is much more efficient than that based on Raviart-Thomas finite elements for the displacement field. The trimmed linearization method is used to linearize the associated rational eigenvalue problem into a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) of the form Ax=λBx. For solving the GEP we apply Arnoldi algorithm to two different types of single matrices B-1A and AB-1. Numerical accuracy shows that the application of Arnoldi on AB-1 is better than that on B-1A. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

79251596552	The Rayleigh-Ritz method, refinement and Arnoldi process for periodic matrix pairs	We extend the Rayleigh-Ritz method to the eigen-problem of periodic matrix pairs. Assuming that the deviations of the desired periodic eigenvectors from the corresponding periodic subspaces tend to zero, we show that there exist periodic Ritz values that converge to the desired periodic eigenvalues unconditionally, yet the periodic Ritz vectors may fail to converge. To overcome this potential problem, we minimize residuals formed with periodic Ritz values to produce the refined periodic Ritz vectors, which converge under the same assumption. These results generalize the corresponding well-known ones for Rayleigh-Ritz approximations and their refinement for non-periodic eigen-problems. In addition, we consider a periodic Arnoldi process which is particularly efficient when coupled with the Rayleigh-Ritz method with refinement. The numerical results illustrate that the refinement procedure produces excellent approximations to the original periodic eigenvectors. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, one dynamical system may create chaos as α varies from zero to one. This may provide an example to show that the homotopy deformation of dynamical systems cannot preserve the long-time dynamics even though the dynamical systems have the same nonlinear terms.

84858075469	A Structured Quasi-Arnoldi procedure for model order reduction of second-order systems	Existing Krylov subspace-based structure-preserving model order reduction methods for the second-order systems proceed in two stages. The first stage is to generate a basis matrix of the underlying Krylov subspace. The second stage is to employ an explicit subspace projection to obtain a reduced-order model with a moment-matching property. An open problem is how to avoid explicit projection so that it will be efficient for truly large scale systems. In addition, it is also desired that a structure-preserving reduced system of order n matches maximum 2n moments. In this paper we propose a new procedure to compute a so-called Structured Quasi-Arnoldi (SQA) decomposition. Once the SQA decomposition is computed, a structure-preserving reduced-order model can be defined immediately from the decomposition without the explicit subspace projection. Furthermore, the reduced model of order n matches maximum 2n moments. Numerical examples demonstrate that the transpose-free SQA-based reduced model is compatible with the two-sided structure-preserving explicit projection methods and is more accurate than the one-sided structure-preserving explicit projection methods due to the higher number of matched moments. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

0037141002	Multigrid convergence of inviscid fixed- and rotary-wing flows	The affect of multigrid acceleration implemented within an upwind-biased Euler method is presented, and applied to fixed-wing and rotary-wing flows. The convergence of fixed- and rotary-wing computations is shown to be vastly different, and multigrid is shown to be less effective for rotary-wing flows. The flow about a hovering rotor suffers from very slow convergence of the inner blade region, where the flow is effectively incompressible. Furthermore, the vortical wake must develop over several turns before convergence is achieved, whereas for fixed-wing computations the far-field grid and solution have little significance. Results are presented for single mesh and two, three, four, and five level multigrid, and using five levels a reduction in required CPU time of over 80 per cent is demonstrated for rotary-wing computations, but 94 per cent for fixed-wing computations. It is found that a simple V-cycle is the most effective, smoothing in the decreasing mesh density direction only, with a relaxed trilinear prolongation operator.

84869845819	A fractional step immersed boundary method for Stokes flow with an inextensible interface enclosing a solid particle	In this paper, we develop a fractional step method based on the immersed boundary (IB) formulation for Stokes flow with an inextensible (incompressible) interface enclosing a solid particle. In addition to solving for the fluid variables such as the velocity and pressure, the present problem involves finding an extra unknown elastic tension such that the surface divergence of the velocity is zero along the interface, and an extra unknown particle surface force such that the velocity satisfies the no-slip boundary condition along the particle surface. While the interface moves with local fluid velocity, the enclosed particle hereby undergoes a rigid body motion, and the system is closed by the force-free and torque-free conditions along the particle surface. The equations are then discretized by standard centered difference schemes on a staggered grid, and the interactions between the interface and particle with the fluid are discretized using a discrete delta function as in the IB method. The resultant linear system of equations is symmetric and can be solved by fractional steps so that only fast Poisson solvers are involved. The present method can be extended to Navier-Stokes flow with moderate Reynolds number by treating the nonlinear advection terms explicitly for the time integration. The convergent tests for a Stokes solver with or without an inextensible interface are performed and confirm the desired accuracy. The tank-treading to tumbling motion for an inextensible interface enclosing a solid particle with different filling fractions under a simple shear flow has been studied extensively, and the results here are in good agreement with those obtained in literature. © 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

84871800357	Numerical studies on structure-preserving algorithms for surface acoustic wave simulations	We study the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) derived from modeling the surface acoustic wave in piezoelectric materials with periodic inhomogeneity. The eigenvalues appear in the reciprocal pairs due to periodic boundary conditions in the modeling. By transforming the GEP into a T-palindromic quadratic eigenvalue problem (TPQEP), the reciprocal relationship of the eigenvalues can be maintained. In this paper, we outline four recently developed structure-preserving algorithms, SA, SDA, TSHIRA and GTSHIRA, for solving the TPQEP. Numerical comparisons on the accuracy and the computational costs of these algorithm are presented. The eigenvalues close to unit circle on the complex plane are of interest in the area of filter and sensor designs. Our numerical results show that the Arnoldi-type structure-preserving algorithms TSHIRA and GTSHIRA with "re-symplectic" and "re-bi- isotropic" processes, respectively, are as accurate as the SA and SDA algorithms, and more efficient in finding these eigenvalues. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

84873704864	A semiorthogonal generalized Arnoldi method and its variations for quadratic eigenvalue problems	In this paper, we are concerned with the computation of a few eigenpairs with smallest eigenvalues in absolute value of quadratic eigenvalue problems. We first develop a semiorthogonal generalized Arnoldi method where the name comes from the application of a pseudo inner product in the construction of a generalized Arnoldi reduction for a generalized eigenvalue problem. The method applies the Rayleigh-Ritz orthogonal projection technique on the quadratic eigenvalue problem. Consequently, it preserves the spectral properties of the original quadratic eigenvalue problem. Furthermore, we propose a refinement scheme to improve the accuracy of the Ritz vectors for the quadratic eigenvalue problem. Given shifts, we also show how to restart the method by implicitly updating the starting vector and constructing better projection subspace. We combine the ideas of the refinement and the restart by selecting shifts upon the information of refined Ritz vectors. Finally, an implicitly restarted refined semiorthogonal generalized Arnoldi method is developed. Numerical examples demonstrate that the implicitly restarted semiorthogonal generalized Arnoldi method with or without refinement has superior convergence behaviors than the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method applied to the linearized quadratic eigenvalue problem. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

84878613587	Matrix representation of the double-curl operator for simulating three dimensional photonic crystals	Three dimensional photonic crystals can be modeled by the Maxwell equations as a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Simulations based on the numerical solutions of the GEVP are used to reveal physical properties and boost innovative applications of photonic crystals. However, to solve these GEVP remains a computational challenge in both timing and accuracy. The GEVP corresponding to the photonic crystals with face centered cubic (FCC) lattice is one of the challenging eigenvalue problems. From a viewpoint of matrix computation, we demonstrate how such obstacles can be overcome. Our main contribution is an explicit matrix representation of the double-curl operator associated with the photonic crystal with FCC lattice. This particular matrix represents the degenerate coefficient matrix of the discrete GEVP obtained by Yee's scheme. The explicit matrix leads to an eigendecomposition of the degenerate coefficient matrix and then a fast eigenvalue solver.

84880556548	Eigendecomposition of the discrete double-curl operator with application to fast eigensolver for three-dimensional photonic crystals	This article focuses on the discrete double-curl operator arising in the Maxwell equation that models three-dimensional photonic crystals with face-centered cubic lattice. The discrete double-curl operator is the degenerate coefficient matrix of the generalized eigenvalue problems (GEVP) due to the Maxwell equation. We derive an eigendecomposition of the degenerate coefficient matrix and explore an explicit form of orthogonal basis for the range and null spaces of this matrix. To solve the GEVP, we apply these theoretical results to project the GEVP to a standard eigenvalue problem (SEVP), which involves only the eigenspace associated with the nonzero eigenvalues of the GEVP, and therefore the zero eigenvalues are excluded and will not degrade the computational efficiency. This projected SEVP can be solved efficiently by the inverse Lanczos method. The linear systems within the inverse Lanczos method are well-conditioned and can be solved efficiently by the conjugate gradient method without using a preconditioner. We also demonstrate how two forms of matrix-vector multiplications, which are the most costly part of the inverse Lanczos method, can be computed by fast Fourier transformation due to the eigendecomposition to significantly reduce the computation cost. Integrating all of these findings and techniques, we obtain a fast eigenvalue solver. The solver has been implemented by MATLAB and successfully solves each of a set of 5.184 million dimension eigenvalue problems within 50 to 104 minutes on a workstation with two Intel Quad-Core Xeon X5687 3.6 GHz CPUs. © 2013 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.

Synchronization between two identical chaotic systems (drive and response) can be implemented provided that the conditional Lyapunov exponents are all negative. By adding amplitude modulation (AM) signals to each subcarrier, the two systems become asymptotically synchronized. The AM signals in each subcarrier can be recovered by the introduction of a filtering process where the Lyapunov exponent of the synchronized error function matches the cutoff frequency of a first order low pass filter.

84888127716	On the convergence of Ritz pairs and refined Ritz vectors for quadratic eigenvalue problems	For a given subspace, the Rayleigh-Ritz method projects the large quadratic eigenvalue problem (QEP) onto it and produces a small sized dense QEP. Similar to the Rayleigh-Ritz method for the linear eigenvalue problem, the Rayleigh-Ritz method defines the Ritz values and the Ritz vectors of the QEP with respect to the projection subspace. We analyze the convergence of the method when the angle between the subspace and the desired eigenvector converges to zero. We prove that there is a Ritz value that converges to the desired eigenvalue unconditionally but the Ritz vector converges conditionally and may fail to converge. To remedy the drawback of possible non-convergence of the Ritz vector, we propose a refined Ritz vector that is mathematically different from the Ritz vector and is proved to converge unconditionally. We construct examples to illustrate our theory. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The resulting matrix eigenvalue problem is then solved using a Jacobi-Davidson based method. Both linear and quintic polynomial eigenvalue problems are simulated. The scheme is 2nd order accurate and converges extremely fast. The superior performance is a combined effect of the uniform spacing of the grids and the nice structure of the resulting matrices.

84893479700	On the energy levels of three dimensional quantum dot with irregular shape	Nanoscale semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been intensively studied in their physics and applications. In addition to theoretical and experimental methods, numerical simulations can also provide useful insights into a QD's electronic and optical properties. However, effective and feasible numerical methods for three dimensional (3D) quantum structures are rarely available. We present novel methods for calculating bound state energies and their corresponding wave functions of a 3D QD model. The model assumes that a irregular shape single low-band-gap semiconductor QD island is embedded in a wideband-gap semiconductor matrix. The heterojunction of the QD can be approximated by an arbitrary smooth function to fit real world QDs nicely. The Schrödinger equation approximating the model in cylindrical coordinate is discretized by using a body fitting finitedifference method. The scheme comes from directly discretization of the Schrödinger equations in curvilinear coordinate system with a clever choice of coordinate axis in the computational domain that gives a sharp local truncation error estimate near the interface and at the same time guarantees the symmetry and positivity of the resulting matrix. As long as the grids are non-crossing, this procedure gives a symmetric and positive definite matrix, regardless of the regularity of the grids. The induced eigenvalue problems are then solved by the Jacobi-Davidson methods. Our numerical experiment results show that the proposed methods can be very efficient and achieve the second order convergence rate.

84903896710	Eigenvalue solvers for three dimensional photonic crystals with face-centered cubic lattice	To numerically determine the band structure of three-dimensional photonic crystals with face-centered cubic lattices, we study how the associated large-scale generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) can be solved efficiently. The main computational challenge is due to the complexity of the coefficient matrix and the fact that the desired eigenvalues are interior. For solving the GEP by the shift-and-invert Lanczos method, we propose a preconditioning for the associated linear system therein. Recently, a way to reformat the GEP to the null space free eigenvalue problem (NFEP) is proposed. For solving the NFEP, we analyze potential advantages and disadvantages of the null space free inverse Lanczos method, the shift-invert residual Arnoldi method, and the Jacobi-Davidson method from theoretical viewpoints. These four approaches are compared numerically to find out their properties. The numerical results suggest that the shift-invert residual Arnoldi method with an initialization scheme is the fastest and the most robust eigensolver for the target eigenvalue problems.

This is especially true when conforming elements are involved. Hence it is advantageous to consider a direct method when finding fluxes is just a small part of the overall modeling processes. The purpose of this article is to introduce a direct method combining the standard Galerkin Q1 conforming method with a cheap local flux recovery formula. The approximate flux resides in the lowest order Raviart-Thomas space and retains local conservation property at the cluster level. A cluster is made up of at most four quadrilaterals.

0346967250	Calculating Flux Perturbations with a Davidson Algorithm	In perturbation calculations, obtaining an accurate flux shape of a perturbed core is more difficult than the multiplication factor. Generalized Davidson algorithms using a symmetric successive overrelaxation preconditioner are developed to solve the unperturbed eigenvalue problem and the related perturbed eigenvalue problem of large sparse matrices. The bases of the subspace obtained from the sequence of solving the unperturbed problem through the algorithm can be used in the perturbed problem to save computational time. One- and two-dimensional test problems indicate that by incorporating symmetric successive overrelaxation iteration, the optimized relaxation factor, and the newly developed shifted form-function vector method for a large perturbation, a considerable amount of computational time can be saved in the perturbed calculations with accuracy comparable to the existing CITATION code. This method also provides an efficient means for survey calculations where the requirement of accuracy is not stringent.

11044235476	A structure-preserving doubling algorithm for continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations	Continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs) can be transformed, à la Cayley, to discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations (DAREs). The efficient structure-preserving doubling algorithm (SDA) for DAREs, from [E.K.-W. Chu, H.-Y. Fan, W.-W. Lin, A structure-preserving doubling algorithm for periodic discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations, preprint 2002-28, NCTS, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, 2003; E.K.-W. Chu, H.-Y. Fan, W.-W. Lin, C.-S. Wang, A structure-preserving doubling algorithm for periodic discrete-time algebraic Riccati equations, preprint 2002-18, NCTS, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, 2003], can then be applied. In this paper, we develop the structure-preserving doubling algorithm from a new point of view and show its quadratic convergence under assumptions which are weaker than stabilizability and detectability, as well as practical issues involved in the application of the SDA to CAREs. A modified version of the SDA, developed for DAREs with a "doubly symmetric" structure, is also presented. Extensive numerical results show that our approach is efficient and competitive. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

10044230310	Partial pole assignment for the vibrating system with aerodynamic effect	The partial pole assignment (PPA) problem is the one of reassigning a few unwanted eigenvalues of a control system by feedback to suitably chosen ones, while keeping the remaining large number of eigenvalues unchanged. The problem naturally arises in modifying dynamical behaviour of the system. The PPA has been considered by several authors in the past for standard state-space systems and for quadratic matrix polynomials associated with second-order systems. In this paper, we consider the PPA for a cubic matrix polynomial arising from modelling of a vibrating system with aerodynamics effects and derive explicit formulas for feedback matrices in terms of the coefficient matrices of the polynomial. Our results generalize those of a quadratic matrix polynomial by Datta et al. (Linear Algebra Appl. 1997;257:29) and is based on some new orthogonality relations for eigenvectors of the cubic matrix polynomial, which also generalize the similar ones reported in Datta et al. (Linear Algebra Appl. 1997;257:29) for the symmetric definite quadratic pencil. Besides playing an important role in our solution for the PPA, these orthogonality relations are of independent interests, and believed to be an important contribution to linear algebra in its own right.

10244255265	Pole assignment for a vibrating system with aerodynamic effect	This paper deals with a pole assignment problem by single-input state feedback control arising from a one-dimensional vibrating system with aerodynamic effect. On the practical side, we derive explicit formulae for the required controlling force terms, which can reassign part of the spectrum to the desired values while leaving the remaining spectrum unchanged. On the mathematical side, unlike the classical Sturm-Liouville problem, our eigenvalue problem is associated with a cubic pencil with unbounded operators as coefficients and has many interesting new features, one of which is that a new controllability condition appears. This condition together with the known controllability condition in the quadratic case are necessary and sufficient. This sheds light on the adjustment of the model parameters. We also analyze the spectrum of the associated noncompact operator and in particular show that the discrete spectrums of controlled and uncontrolled systems lie outside a closed interval on the negative real axis.

12944316334	Fixed-point methods for a semiconductor quantum dot model	This paper presents various fixed-point methods for computing the ground state energy and its associated wave function of a semiconductor quantum dot model. The discretization of the three-dimensional Schrödinger equation leads to a large-scale cubic matrix polynomial eigenvalue problem for which the desired eigenvalue is embedded in the interior of the spectrum. The cubic problem is reformulated in several forms so that the desired eigenpair becomes a fixed point of the new formulations. Several algorithms are then proposed for solving the fixed-point problem. Numerical results show that the simple fixed-point method with acceleration schemes can be very efficient and stable. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
