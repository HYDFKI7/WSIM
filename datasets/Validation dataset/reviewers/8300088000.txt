80052515359	A control scheme of thermal growth compensator for motorized spindles	An improving control scheme of thermal growth compensation for motorized spindles is designed in this paper. In this approach, a dual displacement measurement meter is applied as a compensatory device for spindle thermal growth compensation, which can reduce the measurement error dramatically from single measurement device. It is an external direct checking device and has been considered as one of the best checking device of spindle thermal growth. However, the non-flat surface of spindle nose, fluctuating measurement distance and the tiny measurement meter can hardly be fitted rectangularly to spindle nose surface which creates a certain percentage of error when the single displacement measurement meter is applied. In this design, a differential amplifier will greatly enhance the linear output voltage fed back from dual measurement meter to the CPU and provide a high sensitive level of compensation. Based on this design, the machining tolerance can be improved greatly and machining time is reduced. Therefore, the quality of the machine and the cutting performance can be upgraded. © ICIC International 2011.

58149102115	A theory thermal growth control techniques of high speed spindles	A motorized high speed spindle has very complicated dynamics consisting of non-stationary and speed-related thermal characteristics. Many studies have been reported with different designs to control or monitor spindle's thermal growth with limited results, whereas the application of High Speed Machining (HSM) demands "zero tolerance" no matter the range of speed or material to be machined.

70349625817	A forwarding station integrated the non-confirmed routing protocol in Ad-hoc wireless sensor networks	An ad-hoc wireless sensor network organizes itself as a network that many sensor nodes automatically communicate each other in a certain area. Each sensor node consists of a transmitting unit, receiving unit, central processing unit, and battery unit. Because of the sensor node's battery unit that may not be reachable or rechargeable, it is important for both the base station and sensor nodes communicating very well for less energy consumption of sensor nodes to extend the entire ad-hoc wireless sensor network lifetime. Moreover, in this paper, the ad-hoc wireless sensor network is divided into many clusters and every cluster contains only one cluster head. All wireless sensor nodes will transmit their messages to the cluster head where they belong to. Then, the cluster head will return a confirmed message back to every sensor. However, it dissipates much energy to retransmit a confirmed message from the cluster head to the sensor node. Since the base station is far away from the sensed area, it is necessary to have a forwarding station forwarding the message from the sensed area to the base station. Finally, this paper proposes the forwarding station integrated the non-confirmed routing protocol so that the network lifetime can be extended very well. Also, simulation results show the network lifetime extended well and the performance is much better.

70450277512	A Forwarding Station Integrated the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy in Ad-hoc Wireless Sensor Networks	An ad-hoc wireless sensor network is also called self-organized networking that wireless sensor nodes can automatically communicate for each other. Therefore, each sensor node is no need for the information such as location of each sensor. Similarly, it consumes much energy on the information exchanged of each sensor node in order to maintain the entire ad-hoc wireless sensor network alive. Therefore, there are totally three phases in this paper. First, the setup phase is that all sensor nodes are randomly deployed and the ad-hoc wireless sensor network is divided into many clusters in each round. Therefore, every cluster has only one cluster head. Second, each sensor node transmits its message to the cluster head where it belongs to and then the cluster head transmits the messages coming from sensor nodes and deliver it to forwarding station. Finally, the forwarding station forwards the integrated messages from all cluster heads back to the base station. However, it consumes less energy for all cluster heads to transmit directly back to the base station. Hence, the far away location of the base station usually consumes the cluster head much energy to transmit the message to the base station. With the proposed three-phase scheme, the ad-hoc wireless network lifetime can be extended very well. Also, the simulation results show the entire ad-hoc wireless network lifetime can be extended very well.

However, the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) generation systems is very low, and the output power is always changing with the weather conditions. In order to obtain the maximum output power, one maximum power point tracking (MPPT) denoted as Perturbation and Observation (P&O) method is applied. However, the photovoltaic (PV) panel can only generate electricity when there is sunshine. Therefore, in order to use the electricity generated from solar energy, it is necessary to have battery.

Also, adding the forwarding station extends the network lifetime. Therefore, this paper proposes the integration of both the forwarding station and optimal clusters in ad-hoc wireless sensor networks. Simulation results show that the entire network lifetime proposed is extended in this paper compared to both optimal cluster number selection and normal forwarding station. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84870916252	Circular polarization and polarization reconfigurable designs for annular slot antennas	A simple design for circularly-polarized (CP) annular slot antennas is first described. The antenna is fed by a V-shaped coupling strip loaded with a small resistance, and it can generate CP radiation as long as the inclined angle of the V-shaped coupling strip is properly adjusted. Numerical analyses to the effects of varying the angle on CP axial ratio are performed. Several CP prototypes are fabricated. Both simulated and measured results demonstrate that the proposed feeding mechanism can give good CP performances for the case that the slot width is varied from 0.008 to 0.09 λ

84873712943	Thermal growth measurement and compensation for integrated spindles	The errors which affect the processing tolerance of a machine tool are due to the built-in volumetric errors in the machine tool structure and also the thermal displacement of the machine tools during its cutting. In this paper, a dual-displacement meter compensation system is developed. The new model has a better tolerance control than the single-displacement compensation meter method; also, it has a great potential for saving a machine's warm-up time as well as enhancing productivity. A dual-displacement meter is designed to detect the variation of spindle thermal growth and a differential amplifier is applied which ensure a precise output signal tolerance of spindle thermal growth. The unstable signal which is an effect of flatness tolerance of spindle surface is then omitted. Finally, the spindle thermal growth compensations are successfully reduced. It meets the requirement of high-speed machining and high-precision machining application. © 2012 The Author(s).

84874336394	Ram spindle tolerance compensation for horizontal borer	Ram-Quill combination spindle has been applied widely in horizontal boring milling machine. It is a great benefit that the machine can be used for various applications. But as the report of experiment, the ram housing bent when it is moved for more than half of its maximum travel. The straightness of Ram housing is out of the tolerance and the runout of the spindle is way behind the requirement when spindle is at the maximum extension point. This paper proposes an electro-hydraulic monitoring and compensation system which will be able to adjust the pressure to the compensation mechanism in time. The experiments prove that the straightness of horizontal surface can meet the requirement, and a ball bar test at the extremely weak point shows an improvement of the roundness tolerance for 65.8 %. This can improve the tolerance of the machine, becoming a superior device. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London Limited.

84879705985	Study on mechanical automation with the torque limiter functioned based on infrared interruption	In this research, the verification on the torque limiter is completed by using the mechanism of a torque limiter integrated with the infrared optointerrupter feedback detection. Through a shuttle and an infrared optointerrupter, it is meant to determine whether the rotation mechanism is affected by the mechanism of a torque limiter. With this, it is available to determine if any jamming happens. Through the testing verification of physical mechanisms, the feasibility for the torque limiter proposed by this research is conducted. It can avoid current shorting when dead jamming happens. Also, the detection circuits relevant to the detection of motor current feedback can be saved to reduce systematical circuit maintenance and manufacture torque limiters with long life expectancy, higher stability and low cost. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84879715199	Study on mechanical mechanics and automation with the system analysis and design of the torque limiter functionalities	This study mainly investigates and researches the production of micro-torque limiters by using magnetic force and infrared optointerrupters therein including a permanent magnet, a magnet set, a grating disk, an infrared optointerrupter and a microprocessor, a torque-driven screw rod with the torque generated by the magnetic adsorption force. As the torque limiter is a clutch body, when the external resistance is greater than or equal to the magnetic torque, the rotation of screw rod will stop but start sliding simultaneously. When the screw rod stops rotating, the shutter detection disk also stops rotating. Correspondingly, the pulse signal output of infrared optointerrupters stops. Therefore, the motor of MCU stops by precisely determining whether the screw rod is stopped by external force with the function of torque limiters well exerted. As such, a product advantaged with streamlined sizes, long life expectancy, higher stability, low cost and handy control is reachable. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84879668756	Dual-band ring slot antenna with circular polarization	A design for dual-band circularly polarized (CP) antennas is presented. The antenna is composed of two concentric shorted annular slots, and each slot can generate CP radiation at its one wavelength resonant mode or one-and-a-half wavelength resonant mode by varying the position of the shorted section. When the one wavelength mode of the outer slot and the one-and-a-half wavelength mode of the inner slot are simultaneously excited with a microstrip line, the antenna has two CP operating frequencies with a large frequency ratio (FR). A small FR can also be achieved when the outer and inner annular slots are operated at the one-and-a-half wavelength mode and one wavelength mode, respectively. For the proposed design, two examples with the FRs of 1.05 and 1.9 are designed and implemented. Details of the experimental results are shown. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

84886310301	The illumination characteristics of glass-based Mazu temple buildings compared to traditional temples in Taiwan	The role of religion in providing people spiritual stability and the necessity for conducting worships has increased the demands of religious buildings. Taoist religious buildings have a significant presence in Taiwan. With increasing environmental awareness and declining wood production, current constructions of Taoist buildings have shifted from using wood to employing reinforced concrete as building material. However, insufficient indoor lighting results in buildings requiring artificial lighting, which in turn leads to energy consumption. Therefore, a glass-based material Mazu temple is proposed to substitute wood and reinforced concrete material. The design consideration for building is illustrated in this paper. Furthermore, the illumination of the Mazu temple constructed will is analyzed and compared to a traditional Taoist temple building. The results show that the illumination of glass-based temple buildings is better than traditional temple buliding. Hence, it could reduce the require time of artificial lighting. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

84905905171	Single phase DC to AC inverter with low cost MOSFET driver circuit	In this paper, a single phase dc to ac inverter with a low cost driver circuit was developed. The input source is a battery tank of four series-connected LiFePO4 batteries. The input DC power is then converted into the output AC power with 110Vrms and 60Hz. The proposed inverter is composed of a boost DC converter and a full bridge inverter. As for the circuit architecture, the boost converter is used to boost the battery tank voltage to 190V DC voltage bus. The DC voltage bus is then used to generate the output AC voltage by the full bridge inverter. A low price micro-controller unit HT66F50 was adopted for the controller of the proposed inverter. Moreover, instead of a common switch driver IC, a driver circuit with about 50% cost reduced was constructed for the full bridge inverter. A prototype with 300W rated output power was practically constructed and it can be seen that the total harmonic distortion is lower than 5%. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
